the power to pertect themselves just like he does a possumor a horse . They can almost smell danger . Old Jim run out and  --  whack Sixeymore hit him in the mouth with the hickory club . Killed him dead as a mackrel . That one lick finished him . He just walled his eyes back and died . Then all five of the men went in where old Lizzie Murphy was a settin ' before the fire smokin ' her pipe and she said : " Give me time to pray once more to God Almighty . " She begged to pray but they did n't give her time . Dudley Toms said the hardest thing he ever tried to do was to kill that old woman and her a-beggin ' to just get to pray to God Almighty just one more time . He hit her over the head with a fire shovel , and to make sure she was dead he beat out her brains with the shovel . Then they carried them down and throwed them in the dark waters of Little Sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and uphold dirty work . That water give up the dead bodies down at Cedar Riffles . Some fishermencaught them there . And Dudley Toms did n't know that there was a speck of blood left on his hatband . But there was . See , there 's always a clue . Ca n't do a thing like that and get by with it , not even if the law is on your side . Boy , you suffer for what you do in this old world . Talk about men suffering before they died . I was right there at the hanging . Everybody in the county came to it . It was the biggest hanging we ever had . Had a hanging of five that Sunday . Hung these five and they was the kind of fellows the people liked to see swing to a limb . Was a lot better than just going out and getting somebody for stealing a horse and hanging him , or a man for abusing his wife ; somebody like that hardly had enough against him to hang . I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would n't have to go to jail for it . Used to hang him for the same thing . The people wanted a hanging every week and the sheriff and judge had better have a hanging at least once a month or they wouldp101never get elected again . If they did n't have hangings often enough the people would go to them and say , " Look here , you 'll not get my vote next time if this is the way you intend to do . Lay down on the job , never have a hanging . Damn poor Law . You 'll never be elected again . " Well , the day these five men was hung I was just a boy . I remember it just like it was yesterday . I was up to the jail that morning after the confession and saw them getting their breakfast . Jailer Wurt Hammons said : " Boys , eat hearty . This will be your last grub here on this earth . The devil will serve your breakfast tomorrow morning . You have the chance to have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Well , the Sixeymore boys took a stewed turkey apiece and a biler of black coffee without sugar or cream . Dudley Toms would n't eat a bite . Tim said to him : " Hell , take your hanginglike a man . Go to the gallows on a full stummick . Get that much off the county before you die . " Work Grubb took twelve hard-fried eggs and a pint of licker to wash ' em down with . Winslow took fried eggs and licker  --  do n't remember how many eggs and how much licker . But that is what they had for breakfast . Well , the county carpenter , Jake Tillman , had the county make coffins for them . He was hired to make the coffins for the men the county hung . He had five good county coffins made  --  took their measurements and made them to fit . Had one awfully big for Tim Sixeymore . He was six feet and seven inches tall and weighed some over three hundred pounds . Biggest man I believe I ever saw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hard as the butt of a shell-barked hickory . His brother was about as big and powerful . God , old Tim was a man and not afraid of God Almighty hisself . God would have to watch him at the jedgmentbar . If he got half a chance he 'd do something to God Almighty . I remember the two excursion boats that come down thep102river that day to the hanging and the one that come up the river . They was just loaded with people hollering and waving handkerchiefs around the deck . There was a double-decker come up the river with a load of people . And of all the people that ever come to Blakesburg they were there that day . Mules tied to the trees along the streets  --  not many houses in Blakesburgthem days but there was a thicket of trees through the town . Wagons of all descriptions . Hug-me-tight buggies  --  them things had just come out then  --  people looked at the new contraption and quarreled about the indecency of men and women riding in them little narrow seats all loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example for doing it . And there was a lot of two-horse surreys and rubber-tired hacks and jolt wagons there that day . Jolt wagons with whole familiesriding in wagon beds full of straw . People and people everywhere you looked . Never was such a crowd in Blakesburgas there was that day . Little children crying and dogs that followed the wagons to town out fighting in the streets and the horses neighing to each other and rearing up in the collar , mules biting and kicking each other ! It was the awfulest time I ever saw . If a dark cloud would a riz over that town I would a swore the world was coming to an end . But it was a pretty day for a crowd and for a hanging . Sun in the sky . June wind blowing . Roses in bloom . One of the prettiest days I believe I ever saw . The reason that I remember it so well was that they hung ' em at sunup . Some of the people had come all night to be there in time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band got there . You know they always had a band at the hangings to furnish the music . Had a seven-piece band at this hanging . Always before we just had a drummer , a pot beater , and a fifer . About everybody likes a fife . It puts madnessin their bones and bodies and helps drown the screams of the women and the fighting of the dogs and the whinnyingp103of the horses . The band had on the gayest suits you ever saw for this occasion . Just like a political rally where they used to butcher five or six steers to feed the people . These band players had on bright yaller pants and red sashes and peagreenjackets and them old three-cornered hats . God , but they did look nifty . Well as I remember the band struck up a tune that day . It was " Dixie . " Some of the horses broke loose and took down through the town but the people let ' em go . They stayed still for the hanging . It was the biggest thing we 'd had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and took out through the crowd among the barking dogs , running over them and the children . People did n't pay any attention to that . It was a hanging and people wanted to see every bit of it . They did n't care if a child did get run over so it was n't their own . And it took five or six sheriffs ; they had big guns on ' cm to keep any fights from starting and they wore bright yaller jackets . Lord , all the people there . And you could always tell a mountaineer them days from the back country . He always had the smell of wood smoke on him ! I remember seeing the first horse and express come into sight . Dudley Toms was sitting on his coffin with a rope around his neck , the hangman 's knot already tied . Bert Blevins always did that for the county . One of his knots never did slip . It always flew up in the right place and hit ' em one on the jaw and broke their necks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the horse come in sight and Dudley was a sittin ' up there on the coffin  --  God , the people nearly tore the limbs out of the trees with their jumpin ' and screamin ' and they had that big shell-bark hickory club that Tim hit Jim Murphy with back there the night he made the chicken squall . That had just been three weeks before . They reallyp104brought men to justice back in them days when they had to have someone to hang every Sunday after church . Screams was so loud that you had to hold your fingers in your ears . Here was that big shell-bark hickory club held up in the air by a big man while Dudley stood on his coffin and made his confession . They wanted to hear it . They wanted all out of a hanging that there was in one . At first Dudley Toms would n't talk . The jailer said , " Tell them , Dudley . They want your confession before you give it to the devil . We want it first-handed here . You can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up there on his coffin while that horse  --  a new one they was breakin ' in to haul men to the gallows  --  he just ripped and snorted . And Dudley said , " First time I ever killed anybody . Was hard to kill Lizzie Murphy with that shovel . But I had to do it . No use to cry over spilt milk . I hate like hell to hang . I do . But I 'd rather do it right now and see what all this after death is that I 've heard so much about . I hate to die . But take me out of all this  --  take me out ! " And he kinda broke down . Well , they unfastened his hands from behind him so they could see him kick and pull on the rope with his tongue turnin ' black and hangin ' out of his mouth . They just made him stand on the coffin and they tied the rope that went around his neck to the rope that was already fastened to the old hangin ' - tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band struck up a tune . I 'll never forget seein ' him swing there and kick  --  that expression on the dyin ' man 's face . The band was a-playin ' , the children a-screamin ' because it was the first hangin ' a lot of them had ever seen . Some of the women started shouting . Never saw anything like it in my life . But Dudley 's kinsfolk was there to get him . Some of the women fainted and they just had a couple of barrels of water there so they could throw cold water in the faces of the faint/ing women . That 's what they done . Had boys hired right ready to throw water on the faces of the fainting women or the fighting dogs when they got in the way of the hangin ' . The next to ride up was Freed Winslow . He was up on top of his coffin and the horse that hauled him was n't so afraid of the suits that the bandmen wore . The horse had been to many a hangin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dudley Toms , Freed Winslow was standing on top of his coffin making his confession . It was a fine confession , too , if there was ever a good hangin ' confession made . Said Freed Winslow : " Ladies and gentlemen , I have made peace with my God . I am not afraid to die . I prayed all night last night . I been prayin ' ever since I got in this mess . That very first night after I helped do this killing I saw so many devils around my bed that I had to get up and light the lamp . They was cuttin ' all kinds of shines . They even run across my stummick . God , it was awful . I hope to meet you all in Heaven where there ai n't no devils to run across your stummickand grin at you . Good-by , folks . Sorry for what I have done and I hope you wo n't hold it against me . I ought to die . " So they put the knot over his head and drove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own coffin and the band struck up a tune . While he was in the air struggling for breath and glomming at the wind with his hands , the band players kept pumping harder . That fife kept screaming above the cries of the women . Talking of fainting of pretty girls . They sure did faint . Freed Winslow was a handsome man . There his tongue went out of his mouth . His face black . His curly hair flying in the wind , black as a frostbit pawpaw in the early fall , and he died strugglin ' just like a possum struggles for breath after its neck has been broke under a mattock handle . The next to come up to the hang-tree was Work Grubb . He was thought to be a fine man in the neighborhood . He was a-ridin ' on his coffin , hairiest man you ever saw . Looked likep106one of them men in the days of old with all the beard on his face . He looked kindly like he was ashamed when the wagon rolled up under the tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bet he was n't more than under the ground till the water started seepin ' and the dirt and these worms started crumbling through these knotholes . Well , the band struck up a tune and the people screamed . Just like a man when he makes a score nowdays in baseball . It was a score with death then . The band had to play while the people screamed and waited for his confession . He waited calmly as I ever saw a man waiting for death . He was n't scared , not one iotum . He just waited and when the people screamed till they were hoarse he stood up on his coffin and said , " What I got to say to you is : Go on and kill me . Remember the killer pays . I was guilty and I deserve to die but you do n't deserve to kill me . " One old fat snaggle-toothed woman up and hollered , " You wo n't get pore old Uncle Jim Murphy 's thirty acres of land , will ye ? Might get some hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of desert land down there ! " And she just hollered and laughed at the condemned man going to the elm limb . Well , the band struck up " Dixie . " And the wagon drove out from under him soon as the rope was fastened . And Work swung there with his thin legs dangling in the air . Did n't use a cap on their faces in them days . People wanted to see their faces while they was dyin ' . The band played while he dangled at the end of the rope and clutched for thin air . Of all the cries that ever went up from the people it did there . Then Doc Turner went up and stopped the swinging body and put his hand on the heart . He said , " He 's dead . He 's gone to the other world . " The next they brought up on the wagon was Jake Sixeymore . He was a-laughing . They asked him if he wanted to make any confession . And he laughed and said , " All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my hip pocket for old Satan and ap107good homemade twist . He 's going to have hell , with me and my brother Tim both with him . We 'll both want jobs and we 'll get into it . I want to get on the good side of him first . I 'm not a damn bit sorry over anything I 've done . Just one life to live , one death to die , something beyond or nothing beyond and I 'll hold my own any goddam place they put me . So , swing your goddam rope to me soon as you give me that half-pint of Rock and Rye and that twist of Kentucky-burley terbacker . " " Sure thing , " said the sheriff . " Give it to him . I 'm afraid it 's the last he 'll ever get . " So the fellow just give one of them big horse-pints with just one little dram taken out of it . He give him a twist that looked as big as my arm at the elbow . He took it , thanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dough-belly that shook as he walked , and then he said , " I 'm ready , gentlemen . Pull your goddam rope . " Well , the crowd was kindly quiet for a few minutes , then the band struck up a tune . And he was riding on the highest wagon and the highest coffin . The rope broke his neck the first crack . Of all the screams ! His tongue just come out of his mouth , a twisted tongue , and where he bit it , it was bleeding . God , what a sight . And his face black as a pawpaw leaf . He swung there low against the ground , the limb sagging and the rope swinging . Doc Smith run out and put his ear to his heart . He said , " Dead man . He is in the other world by now or gettin ' mighty close . " Well , people  --  just his old dad and mammy there in their rags . God , I felt sorry for them . I could n't help it . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off in the coffin and carried him a little ways and put him down in the grass . They waited for Tim to die so they could haul them both to the same double grave on the same wagon . Her gray hair flying in the wind , him a mountain man with the smell ofp108wood smoke and cow manure on him . He had shed tears . He was a man stout as a rock . His sons were no stronger-looking than their old white-haired father . Well , the last wagon come up there that day . It had one of the biggest coffins I ever saw on it . The biggest man I ever saw was riding on top of that box . His big hands looked like shovels folded up there on his chest . He looked mean as the devil out of his eyes . They were black eyes and they had beads of fire shining from them . You could see them from the crowd . His hair looked like briers around a stump : a big mop of it , and it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . Clay still on his knuckles where he had worked in the mines . IIe 'd kill and he 'd rob and he 'd work . He was a great worker . Could do as much work as four ordinary men and lift more than any two men in the mines . Lord , he was a sight to look at . He looked like a mountain man . He could eat the side of a hog 's ribs at one meal and a whole pone of corn bread and drink a gallon of buttermilk . He could eat three dozen fried eggs and drink a whole biler of strong coffee . Now he was facing the gallows . He just set there like a rock . I heard one old whiskered man with a willow cane say : " Now , if he confesses all his guilt we 'll get a good confession . " The band struck up a tune . " Dixie , " I believe . Nearly played it and " Old Kentucky Home " to death that day . It was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last one of the five and they just tried to see how much noise they could make . God , it was awful to hear . I remember his pore old mother fainting and how they dashed two buckets of cold water in her face . I remember the tears that come from his pore old pap 's wrinkled eyes . . . it was a sight to see ! I have often wished I 'd never seen it . God , it was awful to think about . When the band stopped the sheriff said , " Let 's hear your confession , Tim Sixeymore. "  |p109Well  , that great big man got up and stood on his coffin . And he looked like a giant to me . Great big devil , unafraid of the whole crowd . And he said , " Yes , I 've got a big confession to make . I got plenty to tell you bastard men and wench women , goddam you ! " You could a heard a pin drop there that day till some strange dogs started fighting and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dogs and got them stopped and the women started nursing the babies and got them stopped . If they did n't want to nurse , the women just made ' em nurse . And they soon stopped crying . They wanted to get the whole confession . " Gentlemen bastards and sonofabitches . Women wenches and hussies and goddam you all . Get this , the whole crowd of you that 's come here to see me hang . I 've done a whole hell of a sight more that I ought to hang for than this . But you  --  you come here to laugh at a man that meets death . All I got to say is goddam every blessed one of you and I hope to hand every one of you a cup of water in hell . You low-down brindle house-cats , come here to hang a man when he ai n't done a single damn thing to you . I 've killed seventeen men , raped five women , stole more than I can tell you about . Got a good mother and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you lousy bastards and wenches and young babies that nurse your mother 's milk . This will be something for you to tell the generations about yet to come . And that is not all . I planned to kill Jim Murphy and Lizzie Murphy . It was all my work and yet all these fellows had to die . I hope God Almighty burns this sonofabitchen tree with lightning before another hundred years roll by . Poor devils without a chance . Die for you to laugh at and see struggle on the scaffold . Die for you to laugh at as you would a chicken fight . You lowdowncowardly sonofabitches . Now laugh at me . I 'll showp110you , by God , how a man can die . I 'm not a bit afraid of whatever is to come . I 'll be ready soon as I get one more good drink of Kentucky whisky and a chaw of terbacker in my jaw . Then you can give me the rope , goddam you . Strike up your goddam band . You people whoop and holler as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can whip any four fair-fisted in the crowd . Will fight you right up here on top of my coffin . Want to try it , any of you ? None  --  " There was silence in the crowd . Not a voice was lifted . " Well , then , give me a drink of licker and a chaw of terbackerand I 'm ready for the Happy Hunting Ground . " The sheriff stepped up and give him a drink out of a full horse-pint and give him a thaw of his own twist of terbacker . I 'll bet twenty men offered him a drink of licker but the sheriff took charge because it was his duty under the sharp eyes of the Law . When he got the rope around his neck I remember he said , " Look here , you bunch of wenches . Let me show you how to die . I 'll hope to give your tail a couple of kicks in hell . I 'll just get there first . So long , you goddam bellering crowd . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The women sniffed and the band struck up the last tune , they thought , for the day . But it was n't the last tune . They put the rope around his neck and tied it to the rope in the tree , and drove the wagon out from under him . Well , he just snapped that rope like it was twine and laughed till you could a heared him for a mile . The limb swayed with him , too . No well rope would hold him after it was wore the way it was , hanging so many people . Somebody went and got another rope . It was a brand new rope . And they fixed a new rope up in the elm and caught another limb so the two of them would n't give . And the seventh time , the rope held him . Well , the sheriff had to arrest his father and mother . They started fighting in the crowd . They 's lots of people started taking it up for them andp111if they had n't got him hung when they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People started taking sides . You know what that meant in them days . It was n't long before the band started playing a retreat . It must have been Napoleon Bonaparte 's retreat or some big general 's  --  maybe George Washington 's . That was what happened at the end of the hangings . Had to have some soft music to soften the people up a little bit . God , it had been an awful day . Women pulling hair and shouting and praying , singing , screaming till you could n't hear your ears . God , Kentuckyused to have her hangings . And that was the biggest one I ever saw in Kentucky . Lauria and Kent Sixeymore riding on their sons ' coffins . Lauria was a-setting on the end of one and Kent was a-setting on the end of the other . It was a sad thing to see . Pore old man and woman ! Their hair white as cotton fleece flyin ' in the spring wind , the dogs a-barking and a-fighting . And the band , just about petered out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People almost in tears ! Big day was over . People getting at the little restaurant where it said , " Good lodging for a man and brute and a glass of licker and a night 's lodging for a quarter . " People trying to get something to eat . Women and children hungry and old skinny hounds running up to the back porches to the slop barrels and fighting over them . People fighting in the streets . Wagons going out of Blakesburg with the dead . No wonder they call that place Hang-Town ! It was a hang-town . If you could just a seen , son , that crowd a-breaking up and leaving . It was a sight . People getting acquainted and talking about the hanging , talking about their crops and the cattle and the doings of the Lord to the wicked people for their sins . That was the biggest hanging I ever saw . Used all them two barrels of cold water on the fighting dogs and the fainting women . When the crowd left , all the gardens and flowers had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofp112the trees where people could n't see out of the crowd and climbed the trees and got up in them like birds ! God , but it was awful ! Then a little later on they got to building a scaffold an ' just letting a body see their bodies before they dropped down into a trap door and a sawdust bottom . They even put a cap over their face till people could n't see their faces . Just kept a-gettin ' it easier and easier till they did n't hang ' ern at all . Got to having baseball games instead and then people got bad in these parts . Law got to be a joke ! Something like it is now . Give ' em just as easy a death as possible , like the hot seat . They used to let ' em hang in Kentucky !  |p113As  I walked up the dusty Academy Branch road with mybooks , I found Pa . He was lying half in the road and half on the grass . Pa 's feet and legs were lying in the road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shoe soles were shining like clean-polished silver in the slanting rays of the setting September sun . Pa 's beardy face was turned up to the sun , too . And he 'd closed his eyes against the sun 's rays . His big arms and hands lay limp beside his huge body on the wilted ragweeds . His mattock , shovel , and sickle lay beside him . I knew my sisters , Etta and Claris , had passed Pa up . They 'd come from the Blakesburg Graded School and had beaten me home . Brother Estil , an eighth-grader , had come home with them , too . Claris and Etta could n't help Pa . But Estil could . Estil could have pulled his legs around out of the road for when Pa got like this he was always limber at the knees . The trouble was , they were ashamed of our father. 113 " Pa , " I said , as I walked over to him , " wake up ! " Pa grunted and groaned like a man in a deep sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook him . I knew how to wake him . I shook him and I rolled his head from side to side in his loose black hat . " Alex , " Pa groaned as he tried to rise . " It 's not old Alex , Pa , " I said . " It 's Melvin . " " Oh , it 's you , Mel , " he mumbled as he tried to get up . " You 've come after me . " " No , I just happened to find you . " Then Pa pulled with all his might under his own power and I lifted . We got him up to a sitting position . I put his arm around my shoulder and he used all the power in his body . After three tries , we got him to a standing position . He steadied himself by putting his hand on my back until I reached over and got his mattock , shovel , and sickle . Pa put his arm around my shoulder , and held the sickle in his hand . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of his weight . He was a big man , too . My father weighed two hundredforty pounds . We walked slowly up the dusty road and turned up Left Academy Branch . I bore up well with my load until we reached the little hill where our shack sat upon the steep bank . Then it was work getting Pa up the hill . Streams of sweat ran down my face . But I was n't going to leave my father beside the road with his legs half across it for a wagon wheel to run over . Maybe it would be an automobile , for a few of them came up Academy . I was in high school , too , and I had a lot of pride . I did n't want everybody seein ' Pa in this condition . When we got to the front porch we saw Etta , Claris , and Estil sitting there . " Come , Mom , see what Mel 's bringin ' home , " Estil shouted.  | " I 'd be ashamed if I 's you , Estil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down there half in the road and half out and lose his legs . You do n't have no pride . Wait until next year when you get into high school , you 'll change your mind . You 're like Claris and Etta , you 're ashamed of Pa ! " " We are ashamed of ' im ! " Etta was quick with her words . " If he gets in that condition let ' im lay there until he gets out , " Estil said . Then Mom came running onto the porch . " Oh , it 's Uglybird , " she said . " Where did you find ' im ? " " Beside the road , " I said . " His body on the grass and his legs across the road . Why did n't Etta , Claris , or Estil tell you about ' im ? " " We did n't want Mom liftin ' on ' im , " Claris said . " We knew Mom would go down there and try to fetch ' im to the house ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted . " He 's the cause of Uglybird 's downfall . Every time somebody dies and he digs the grave and gets paid , here 's that old bootlegger to get Uglybird 's money . Hauls him down there and dumps him out beside the road ! I 'd love to choke old Alex until his tongue lolls out . " " But help me get him in the house , " I said . I was standing there holding the shovel and mattock . And Pa 's arm around my shoulder was as heavy as lead . " Leave ' im on the outside , " Mom shouted . " I ca n't bear ' im . " Then Pa looked up at Mom . When he looked at her he grinned . " Now , you 're talkin ' to ' im , Mom , " Estil said . " I 'm glad to hear you talk like that . He 's treated you bad enough ! Rememberthe time he came home on a big bender and sickled your flowers down ? " " I hate for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " When his name is mentioned everybody starts laughing and I bow my head in shame . " " If it was n't for you , Mom , we 'd starve to death , " Etta said . " Everybody in Blakesburg thinks Pa beats you up . " Then I looked at my father 's ugly face . Everybody thought he was ugly but Morn . Pa was still looking at Morn with a grin on his face . " Shut up ! Every last one of you , " Mom shouted . " He 's your father and you should respect him ! " Mom , who was as slender as a beanpole , and she was as fast in her movements as Pa was slow , ran down the front steps like a sparrow . She took the mattock and shovel from me and the sickle from Pa and ran to the tool shed . Morn was a woman that did n't want anything lying in the front yard . She kept the house clean and neat and the yard as clean and pretty as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she put Pa 's other limp arm around her shoulder and we started up the steps with him . Pa did his best to hug Mom as we went up the steps . " None of your foolishness now , Uglybird , " Mom said . " I love you , Mollie , " Pa mumbled . " Shut your mouth , Uglybird , " Mom snapped like a turtle . When we got him in the house , Mom put him on the best bed . Mom did n't mind his dusty clothes on her clean bed . Then she took his shoes off and spread a clean sheet over Pa so he would n't be uncovered in a draft . She put a feather pillow under his head . " I would n't do it , Mom , " Claris said . " You 've got more patience than I 'll ever have with a man . " " Shut up , Claris , " Mom scolded her . " You do n't know how much patience you 'll have with a man . It 's old Alex Troxler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mom and grinned again . " I love you , Mollie , " he mumbled . " I could about squeeze you in two right now if I could lift my hands up to you ! "  |p117Then  Mom had me kill a chicken and she made Pa some broth that night . She fed him with a big spoon . " Mel is the only child I have with the right respect for his father , " Mom said as we watched her feeding Pa broth with a tablespoon . " I want the rest of you to get respect for ' im . He 's a good father . Alex Troxler , that old bootlegger , lives too close to Lonesome Hill ! I could choke his tongue out ! And the Law that lets old Alex get by with his bootleggin ' I could pour scaldin ' water from a teakettle spout on the last one of ' em !

" " Do n't let me hear you say that again , Claris , " Mom snapped as she gave Pa another spoonful of broth . " He 'll drink the broth tonight and be ready to eat the chicken to-morrow . " The next morning Pa was all right . And as usual he never mentioned what had happened the day before . Pa never bragged about the benders he got on . He was n't exactly ashamed of ' em . He just did n't talk about ' em . Pa ate chicken for breakfast and drank a lot of black coffee . He sat across the table from Mom and when he looked at her , he smiled and there was a light in his eyes . As we walked down Academy Branch to school , Pa walked along with us . He was dressed in clean blue overalls , jumper , blue workshirt , and a pin-striped cap . " Now , let 's all stay together , young'uns , " he told us when Claris and Etta tried to run ahead . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ! " Claris , Etta , and Estil were glad when they left us to go to the Blakesburg Graded School . Pa and I went on together . " Mel , your ma is a great woman , " Pa said as we walked along . " There was never another one like ' err " Do you really love Mom ? " I asked  | " Love her , " he said , with a big smile spreading over his face , " I could squeeze her in two ! " " How do all the big tales get started about your beatin ' Mom ? " I asked him . " I 'll show you one of these days , " he said . " How can you talk the way you do and love my mother ? " I asked him . " See , I was called Uglybird from the time I was a baby because I was so ugly , " he told me . " I know I 've got a head the shape of a pear turned upside down . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't pull , big moose jaws , and shoulders as broad as a corncrib door . Got eyes that slant and everybody who looks at me thinks I 'm awfully ugly . Now , your mother was a skinny homely girl when she was growing up . No boy only me ever noticed her . And she 's the only girl who 'd look at me . So we got married and the longer we looked at each other , the more beautiful she was to me and the more handsomeI was to her . We got better-lookin ' to each other all the time . And two people actually as ugly as we are have two handsome boys , and two of the best-lookin ' gals in these parts ! " Then Pa laughed as I 'd never heard him laugh before . " Stop here on the courthouse square with me a minute , Mel , " he said . " I 'll show you how tales get started . " There was a group of strange men standing on the courthouse square talking . Pa walked over where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and smiled . " Do any of you fellers have any troubles with your wives ? " Pa asked . " Well , yes , " one muttered , since Pa had asked him so suddenly . " I guess every man and his wife have a few words now and then , " said another , very seriously . " I 've been married twenty years , " Pa said . " I 've got a rem/edy for getting rid of all that trouble . Give your wife a good beating twice a week ! " Pa did n't laugh at his own words . He rolled up his jumper and shirt sleeves , and contracted a knot of muscles on his great arm which was as large as a goose egg . " Twice a week I shake my little skinny wife until she screams , " Pa told them as the men looked strangely at each other . " I shake her until her teeth rattle . And they 're not false ivories either . I 'm boss at my home . Every man should be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Pa walked away while the men looked at him and at each other . After Pa and I had gone , they started laughing . We heard them laughing as Pa went on his way to dig the well and I went on to high school . Pa 's tales about his beating my mother had spread everywhere . He would tell them how he made Mom milk four cows night and morning , feed five fattening hogs , carry water from a spring , feed the chickens , and gather eggs . How he made her do these things in addition to keeping a clean house and an orderly yard filled with pretty flowers . He never told these strangers any better . And when Pa walked down the road with us , on our way to school , he 'd say , " September sixteenth . This was the day Tom Jason was caught and hanged for pizening his wife ! Have to sickle the briers from old Tom 's roof today . " Or , Pa 'd say , " November nineteenth . On November 19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced a jig on the street . Wonder where he 's dancing now ? Got to straighten his marker today . " Pa knew everybody buried on Lonesome Hill , the day he departed life , and the cause . Each week in the year , he would always mention one 's name and say something about him . Pa had worked on Lonesome Hill helping his father , Grandpa Tobbie Skinner , when he was a boy . Grandpa Skinner hadp120been the first sexton and he had told Pa about everybody buried there . And Pa , from the time he took over , never failed to get the history of each inmate on Lonesome Hill . And when he said something about one each day , my sisters were ashamed . But Pa did n't mind . And on a hot July day when we were sitting peacefully under the sweet-gum shade in our front yard , John Cantwell and Wilburn Collins came down the Left Academy Branch with eight yoke of cattle hitched to a log wagon . They were pulling a yellow-poplar log fifty feet long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down below our house . " Stop the cattle , Wilburn , " Pa shouted . " Let ' em wind . It 's a hot day to pull a log like that ! " Wilburn stopped the cattle and started talking to Pa . While Wilburn talked , Pa looked over the oxen until he came to the wheel cattle , a yoke of big Red Pole bulls . They were butting each other while John Cantwell punched with a sharp stalk to quiet them . " Go fetch me a bucket , Mollie , " Pa told Mom . " What kind of a bucket , Uglybird ? " Mom asked . " Water bucket , " he said . Mom jumped up and ran to the kitchen and brought back a water bucket in a jiffy . " Here 's the bucket , " she said , giving it to Pa . " I do n't want it , " he said . " You do the milking . Go down there and milk them cows there against the cart Uncle John 's a-havin ' such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mom threw the bucket over the hill and took off . Claris got up and left too . Wilburn turned his face the other way and laughed louder than the slow-moving wind among the sweet-gum leaves . Etta looked hard at Pa when she got up and left . I sat beside Pa and watched Wilburn and John drive the oxen down the roadp121with the long log , barely making curves since they were laughinguntil they could n't speak to their oxen . Pa did another thing , too . Once when he was in Blakesburg where they were paving the streets , he looked at some empty cement sacks . " I like the looks of these cement sacks , " Pa said . They were cloth sacks , dusty with cement and piled in a heap near a large concrete mixer . " Like the looks of ' em ? " said a stranger , who was overseeingthe road job . " If you 'd like to have ' em I 'd be glad to give ' em to you ! " " I shore would , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " My father thanked the man as if he 'd given him a fortune . " Say , fellow , " the man said , " I never like to be inquisitive about a man 's business , but I 'd like to know what you want with ' em ! " " Take a guess , " Pa said as he started to gather the big pile of sacks into his arms . " I 'd think you 'd want them to cover a lettuce or a tobacco bed , " he said . " I 'm not a farmer , " Pa told him . " I 'm a gravedigger . I want these sacks to make me a suit of clothes ! " Pa never cracked a smile . The man looked at Pa and then he burst into explosive laughter . He did n't believe Pa . And when we went away , this man walked over and was telling one of the men who worked for him something . And when I looked back , he was telling another man and they were laughinguntil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa took the sacks home , Mom wanted to know what he was going to do with them . When Pa told her , she started laughing . " Uglybird , everybody thinks you 're so ugly already , " she said between spasms of laughter . " What will they think when you wear a suit made of cement sacks ? "  | " I 'll make ' em laugh , " Pa said . " I 'll be a better-lookin ' man than I 've ever been . I 'll make everybody laugh . What the world needs is a little more laughter . I'Il even wear my suit on Lonesome Hill ! Too much grief out there nohow . " But Mom was still laughing at Pa 's idea . " If you 'll wash these sacks , I 'll make the suit for you , " Mom said . Pa washed and dried the sacks . Mom made him a jumper and overalls . She made Pa a little cap out of a cement sack , shaped like the pin-striped caps he wore . When Pa put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Blakesburg in his slow gait , his arms swinging like big heavy pistons , everybodyhe met could n't speak to Pa for laughing . They laughed after he 'd passed them . They 'd stand on the street and look at Pa as he walked on and roar with laughter . The men working on the street stopped pouring concrete as Pa walked by . They looked at him and their laughter was explosive . Everybodyin Blakesburg laughed . At the first funeral on Lonesome Hill after Mom had made him his suit , Pa stood by the grave he 'd dug with a shovel in his hand . Across the broad shoulder on his jacket and across the seat of his pants was the brand of cement and the name of the company . And when Pa moved around , several people had to hold their laughter . One evening Pa told Mom that the Dawson Hardware owner , Henson Cauldwell , told him the brand of cement Pa was advertising on his suit had sold better than any other brand . I had finished high school and sister Claris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blakesburg High School . Pa was proud of sister Claris . He told everybody she took her beauty after him . There was a picture of Claris on the front page of the Blakesburg Weekly News . And , the following week , there was a picture of Pa on the front page . It was thep123first and only time Pa ever got his picture in the paper . And here is how he did it . Blakesburg was putting on a charity drive . Pa thought of a way to make some money . Since he had had only one fight in his life , and had lifted a man over a fence with his fist for calling him a liar , he challenged Jason Whiteapple to fight him . Pa was now forty-five and Jason was forty-five . But Jason weighed three hundred and forty pounds . Jason Whiteapplewas the only man in our county who could kill a beef with his fist . He never shot one but broke its neck with his fist . Pa had the editor to write up how he felt the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight would be held in the high school gym . They were not to use any gloves and might fight , without intermission , until one knocked the other out . And Pa concluded he wanted to do this for charity for he knew what it was to be poor since he had been a poor man once himself . Here was a picture of Pa , stripped to the waist , showing his woolly expanded chest and the goose-egg knots of muscles on his arms . The lower half of Pa 's body was dressed in his cement-sack pants . ' When people saw the picture of Pa they laughed again . But Jason Whiteapple refused to fight " Uglybird the Undaunted . " Pa continued to dig graves on Lonesome Hill as the years passed . And he continued to tell each day of the man that had passed on . Pa would n't let him be dead . He kept the sleepers on Lonesome Hill alive . They were his companions since he kept their last homes in order . Pa found new angles for his stories on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tolerated Mollie was because she 'd get up at midnight and make him a pot of black coffee if he asked her . He tolerated her because she saddled and bridled his horse when he wanted to ride . She split kindling with a double-bitted ax and made fires on early winter morn/ings and warmed his socks . The women on Academy Branch who had seen Pa lying beside the road where Alex had dumped him many times also spread tales on Pa . Down in Blakesburg , women believed Pa had done all the things he said he had to my mother . They talked about how he did n't love her . They knew poor Mollie Skinner had held on because of her fine family . In late May after Etta , the youngest , had finished BlakesburgHigh School my mother complained of not feeling too well . As she sat in her rocking chair one evening while my sisters went ahead with the work , she did n't answer when Etta spoke to her . She was sitting with her eyes half open . Her breath had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one my father or my grandfather did n't dig on Lonesome Hill . And on the day of her death , Pa did n't tell us his character sketch of an inmate on LonesomeHill . Pa 's big lips were n't spread in smile and he did n't give us his words of cheer . There was n't any light in his squinty blue eyes . And this time the man who had seen so much grief on Lonesome Hill , and had tried to cheer other people , felt some of that same grief . Even in the funeral crowd when Mom was laid to rest , women looked at Pa and whispered softly to each other . I heard one whisper , " If that old brute had been better to her and had n't beaten the poor thing she might have been on top of the ground today instead of under it . He did n't love her . " Not more than a half-dozen women in that funeral crowd went up to Pa and extended to him their sympathies . This hurt me . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they thought until Pa told me how he loved my mother until he could squeeze her in two . I never forgot how homely he said she was and how no man would look at her and no woman would look at him when they were young.  |p125But  they noticed each other , and as the years passed she became more beautiful to him . After Mom was gone , Pa never went back to Blakesburg . And he never put on one of his cement-sack suits Mom had made for him . He gave up being sexton of Lonesome Hill . Estil and I took over Pa 's job . In early June , Pa took a little basket of Mom 's flowers from the yard and went up on LonesomeHill . He took his sickle along with him . It was the first time I 'd ever seen my big father carry a little basket of flowers . Then , every day through June , he took a basket of her flowers back to her . " Pa , do n't take it so hard , " Claris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I 'll try to take Mom 's place here at the house . " " No one can ever take her place , Claris , " Pa said . " More than half of me is dead . " Every day in July , rain or shine , Pa carried a small basket of Mom 's flowers to her on Lonesome Hill . " You look sick , Pa , " I said . " Is there something wrong with you ? " " Sick in the head as well as the heart , " he said . " I 've got a burnin ' in my head . " Then my father started losing weight . In early August it was hard for him to climb Lonesome Hill with his basket of flowers which he took each morning before sunup . By middle August , Estil and I took Pa to Doctor Torris in Blakesburg . " That burnin ' in your head is worry ! " Doctor Torris looked at Pa and smiled . " You 've got to pull out of it , Uglybird ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friends stopped him . Each one asked what was wrong . Pa 's answer was that he had a burning in his head . And they laughed at Pa like they had laughed when he wore the cement-sack suits . Anything Pa said to them was funny. 126During the last two weeks of August , Pa managed to get to Lonesome Hill by walking with a cane . On the last day of August , three months after my mother 's death , Pa collapsed at our front doorstep with his cane in one hand and his empty flower basket in the other . Estil ran to Blakesburg for Doctor Torris . But before Doctor Torris arrived , Pa had breathed his last . It took only three months of grief to kill one of the most powerful men I had ever known.  |p127We  must be like other colleges , " Professor Dixon said . " We ca n't let a thing like this go on . We must have better sportsmanship between the lower- and up-perclassmen ! " Professor Dixon pulled the neatly folded handkerchief from the pocket near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his shoebrush mustache as he looked us over with his black beady eyes . We upperclassmen sat on one side of the auditorium while the lowerclassmen sat on the other . Not one of us dared cross the broad aisle . The feeling between our groups was high . Only an hour before , President Poore had called a special chapel at Carver College . He gave a long talk , pleading for " harmony between the upper- and lowerclassmen . " Then he prayed for " divine guidance in this time of trouble , " since127p128all he and his faculty members had done toward ironing out our differences had been fruitless . It had begun two weeks before when three seniors started to " initiate " Bullie Sneed who had been brought to Carver from a mountain school to play football . Bullie could n't understand why three seniors would " get funny " with him , and since he was big , powerful , and handy with his dukes , he whipped all three . Then the upperclassmen came to their classmates ' aid and Bullie 's friends started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble started . On the afternoon this fracas occurred , we gathered at the dining-room door for supper . Most of us worked all or part of our way and we were usually hungry and gathered at the dining-room entrance fifteen or twenty minutes before it opened . On this evening , soon as Bullie jumped on one of the three seniors who had tried to " initiate him into the Carver fold " the fight was on . Everybody joined in and it was a free-for-all such as old men and women had never seen before . We knocked windows from the dining room , crashed doors , tramped shrubbery and flowers into the ground . Faculty members came and could n't stop the fight . PresidentPoore came and he could n't do anything with us . The town marshal and his deputies were called and they could n't do anything about our fighting . The Clayton County sheriff , a big red-faced robust man , and his deputies were called and they rushed to the scene but could n't stop us . We fought until we got so tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of his fellow buddies who had been knocked cold and trampled on and those with closed eyes . We upperclassmenwere n't whipped and we knew it . And the lowerclassmensaid they were n't whipped . But I do know it was the first time in the history of our school where we had such a big crop of lowerclassmen thatp129we upperclassmen were afraid of them . I know that we were afraid , though we would n't admit it , for we took baseball bats and clubs into our rooms so if we were attacked we 'd have something harder than our fists to strike back with . After we 'd had this fight , President Poore met with his faculty and decided to do something about it . That night a meeting was called in Republican Hollow in an apple orchard where we were supplied with wieners , buns , and marshmallows . A bonfire was built for us and someone brought a brandnewhatchet . After we ate , only a few men from each side testified how well they liked their fellow students on the other side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very weak , and after the singing we buried the hatchet . But only a few of the more peaceful mountain boys from each side participated in this affair . On that very night strong young upperclassmen stood back under the apple trees whose autumn leaves glowed in the soft bright firelight . They whispered to each other while the singing went on and looked beyond the bonfire at another group of larger boys and more of them , known as lowerclassmen . We could hear their voices and a few cuss words as they looked and pointed at us . We knew the trouble was not at an end , that we would meet sometime somewhere and fight it out even if on this night we had buried the hatchet . " Now back East we had good sportsmanship at all the collegesand universities , " Professor Dixon said , as he put his handkerchief back . " And I do n't see any reason why we ca n't have it here . Of course , this is my first experience in a mountaincollege . But I think we can initiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote a spirit of friendly rivalry . " Then Professor Dixon looked us over . Not a man on either side smiled . One could hear a person breathe . " I have a little game in mind , " Professor Dixon said , " thatp130we used to do back East . And it 's fun . We 'll put a flag in the top of a big tree and let forty-five of you upperclassmen defendthe flag and let fifty lowerclassmen try to take it from the tree . " " Why let them have fifty men and us only forty-five ? " Big Dick Donley , president of the senior class , asked . " But you see , Mr. Donley , " Professor Dixon persuaded , " the lowerclassmen have an uphill fight . They have to climb . the tree to get the flag and you can put as many men around the tree as you want to guard the tree and as many men up in the tree as you think is necessary to keep the freshmen down ! They have the odds against them ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , his face reddening . " What do you think about it ? " Professor Dixon asked , looking toward the big lowerclassmen . " What do you say , Bullie ? " a tall freckled-faced boy said . " I say we can take that flag , " Bullie said . " Maybe , " someone on our side said . " Where is the tree ? " I asked , wondering if we had a tree big enough on the campus . " We 've got the tree selected and the flag in it , " Dixon said . " Then what are we waiting on ? " Big Dick said . " We 're ready , " Bullie said . When we left the auditorium , our side went out together . We followed Big Dick . The freshmen followed Bullie . Not one of our men got mixed up with their crowd and not one of their men got mixed up with us . " Now you can call your men off to themselves and plan your strategy , " Professor Dixon told Big Dick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Big Dick said . " We know that gang we 're up against . " " As soon as you 're through talking it over , " Professor Dixon said , " let me know and I 'll take you to the tree . "  |p131We  knew that Big Dick , who was the most powerful among us , would go to the very top of the tree to protect our flag . And below him we would put our best tree climbers , tall men who could swing on limbs and could kick with their long legs . " Step on their hands when they start climbing up , " Big Dick told us ; " kick ' em down any way you can even if you have to ram the toe of your shoes in their mouths . That 's the toughest crop that 's ever come to Carver . We 'll have a time with ' em . Let 's go keep our flag flying at any cost . " " Ready , Professor , " Big Dick shouted . Big Dick arranged for himself and eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree . He selected twelve more men , the heavy powerful men , to guard the trunk of the tree , and the remaining twenty-one to meet Bullie and his gang as they came uphill toward the tree . Big Dick called us his " assault troops " and he put me with this group . When he selected me , I shook like a leaf , for I knew what was coming . I 'd seen too many fights between the lower- and upperclassmenalready . I 'd seen Big Dick hit Stanley Graff , knock him clean through a window , taking out sashes and windowpanes , when we were working in the shoe shop . But this freshman came around the house and back in at the door for some more . He was tough . They were all tough . Big Dick , **27;10857;TOOLONG pounder , was a man . He could run the hundred in nine and four-fifths seconds . He 'd taken as many as seven first places in track meets ; he was fullback on our football team , a guard on our basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was handy with his dukes . He did a lot of boxing but he could n't hurt Graff . Professor Dixon led the way and Big Dick followed him and we followed Big Dick . The men to follow Big Dick up the tree , mostly our basketball squad , were up near Dick . Andp132the tree guards , which were mostly the linemen on our Bulldogs , followed the tree climbers . And we " assault troops " followed the tree guards . I do n't know what Bullie said to his men or how he arrangedthem . They followed us , hollering like a pack of wolves . When Professor Dixon showed us the tree , we looked to the top and saw our flag , a big white cloth , flying from the topmost twig above the copper-colored leaves . It was a big elm tree , the biggest and prettiest tree on the campus , where many of us had sat with our sweethearts on Sunday afternoons . Many of us who had been more interested in the course of " love " than any other subject in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . But now it was just another tree . Big Dick put his powerful arms around its trunk and went up its stalwart body like a cat until he reached the first limbs . Then the climbing was easier . Behind Big Dick were Big Nick Darter , Amos Smelcher , Tim Evans , Johnnie Dowling , Enic Pratt , Charlie Fugate , like ants following each other up the tree . While down below us at the foot of the hill was Bullie Sneed in front of his men , waiting until the signal was given to battle us . Our tree guards gathered around the tree trunk and waited while we , the assault men , grouped together , each one trembling like a leaf in the wind , and waited for the signal to meet Bullie and his fifty men . There were twenty-one of us . We knew we would n't be able to stop Bullie and all his men but we could slow them . " Ready , everybody , " Big Dick shouted to his men from the top . " Have been ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , let 's go , " Professor Dixon commanded . " Let 's meet ' em with full force , fellows , " Ickie Porter shouted , running downhill to meet Bullie.  |p133When  we met Bullie and his men we hit body to body , head on and every way that men could hit . I was never hit harder in line practice in football . Men were knocked down and they groaned when others fell upon them or over them . Fists flew and men kicked . We knew it was a fight to a finish . As I went around and around with some freshman , I looked below me and saw some big man had Ickie down sitting on him , resting as he fanned his hot face . And then as we whirled around in a tussle , I saw Bullie , with a pack of big men , shoving our men aside and making it toward our guards . " Take ' em , men , " Bullie screamed as they fought their way to the tree . " Knock ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I saw our men upend Bullie 's men as they approached , but not for long . Bullie and his men would reach up and get one of our guards by the hand or pants leg or sleeve and jerk him down the hill over the slick grass , stripping his clothes as they went . " Fight ' em , men , " Big Dick yelled as he observed the fight from the treetop . " Stand your ground ! They 're closin ' in ! " " Stand , hell , " someone shouted . We were a battered lot . Many of us hardly had on enough clothes to hide our nakedness . Noses were bleeding , teeth were knocked loose , hands were hurt , and men were lying senseless upon the grass but the fight went on . Bullie was trying to go up the butt of the tree while his men , who had overpoweredour guards by numbers and not strength , guarded him . Bullie got up to the first limbs when Tim Evans dropped down low enough to kick Bullie until he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our men in the tree laughed to see Bullie knocked from the tree . But it did n't hurt Bullie . He got up and started up the tree again while his men pounded our tree guards and " assault men " until we were all nearlyp134knocked out , lying helpless upon the grass . Often three of his men would polish off one of ours . Not until now did we know Bullie 's tactics . When he got us out of the way on the ground he could concentrate on the tree . Finally I got my man down and he was willing to lie down for awhile . He had had enough . I went to rescue Ickie for three of Bullie 's men were sitting on him , resting while he groaned beneath the load . When I approached , one of the men jumped up , grabbed me at the neck , stripped my shirt clean , and slung me twenty feet or more down the hill where I whirled and spun before I finally hit headfirst on the grass . " Hold that tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight from his safe perch . Now Bullie and several of his men had places up in the elm . And our men had dropped down to kick them , but they caught their feet and legs and were trying to pull them from the tree . One of their men was holding to Big Nick Darter 's legs and swinging like he was on a grapevine swing while Big Nick held to the limb above with all his strength . Girls could no longer be held in their dormitories . They broke out and came to see the fight . The upper-class girls were on our side yelling for us while the others were yelling for the lowerclassmen . Faculty members came too , and though they had preached sportsmanship to us , they started yelling for one side or the other . Someone called the town marshal and his deputies and the county sheriff and his deputies . It was one of the women teachers or maybe the president who had got scared again . And they came , but they could n't do anything with the ninety-five men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bullie 's men let Ickie up and grabbed me . They threw me down and sat on me while they rested . And their load was something to bear up . From where they sat on me , I could look up and see the fight in the tree and I could hearp135the screams from the men in the tree above the roar of the crowds . " Get that man in the top , " Stanley Graff yelled . " Then we 'll haul down their dirty rag . " The lowerclassmen did n't pull Big Nick Darter down but when another one swung on his legs to pull him loose , they broke the limb from the tree and Big Nick came down holdingit in his hands with two men holding his legs . They hit the ground with a thump . No one bothered about them in the thickest of the fight . I saw Bullie and his men getting higher and higher in the tree . I saw limbs coming down with men holding them and two or three men holding to their legs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few limbs remained in the top where Big Dick was still safe for he was guarded by three men below him . But Bullie must have had twelve men left . We wondered how long it would be before they got Big Dick and our flag . Bullie was the highestof all his men but one of our men stepped down and put a foot on each of Bullie 's shoulders and jumped up and down . Though Bullie hugged the tree like a bear he could n't take this . He dropped down without a limb to catch him but he fell on a soft pile of men . " Stop the fight , Sheriff , " some faculty member yelled . " Here goes my football team ! " Coach Powers yelled . " Who planned a thing like this anyway ? " " My basketball team , " Coach Charlie Andrews yelled . " Sheriff , ca n't you do something ? " But the sheriff could n't climb that tree where the fight was raging . There was n't any more fighting on the ground for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't anything that a sheriffcould do . When Amos Smelcher came down he brought a freshman with him and Tim Evans and Johnnie Dowling brought two each . But six men were up in the tree.  |p136The  fight was up among the last limbs where the elm top rocked in the wind . Every time a man started up , Big Dick kicked him down . He kicked Bullie 's men until they fell out or had to come down . Just one man stayed . He would n't leave . That was Stanley Graff . He would reach up to get Big Dick by the leg . But Big Dick would kick at his hand and he 'd jerk it back while everybody yelled like at a basketball overtime period when the score was tied . Big Dick got mad at Stanley 's tactics . He dropped down a step to put his feet on Stanley 's shoulders to shove him from the tree . But Stanley got him by the legs and started swinging and since Big Dick was so heavy and the top limb was so small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came , bringing all the treetop but the one twig that held our flag . " There goes my track team , " Coach Speed Mullins yelled as Big Dick dropped through the air still clinging to the elm limb and with Stanley Graff holding to his legs . Then the crowds rushed in to help care for their wounded . Someone pulled the three lowerclassmen from me . I was n't hurt like many of the others but I had escaped only in my undershirt , shorts , socks , and shoes . Since Carver College did n't have an ambulance , they rushed the college truck to the scene . I saw them carry Big Nick Darter , our best baseball player , and the two lowerclassmen that had swung on his legs to the truck . They were knocked cuckoo . Then they picked up Bullie Sneed and carried him to the truck . He yelled , cussed , kicked with one leg , and screamed , and his words sounded funny for he had lost his front teeth and one leg was broken . Next they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as icicles , and laid them side by side in the truck bed . The driver gunned the truck and was away , rushing them to Natesboro General Hospital ,  |p137across  the mountain . The rest of us could nurse our own bruises . " Come on , pal , " Ickie Porter , my roommate , said to me . " You 've got on more clothes than I have . " Ickie only had on his shorts . He held my arm for I was wobbly , and we walked past where the coaches had surrounded Professor Dixon and a great argument was going on . But we 'd had all we wanted and we did n't stop to listen . We did n't want to listen any longer to the moans coming from men stretched out on the grass where their sweethearts , friends , and faculty members administered sympathy . " Look , " Ickie said , stopping to point back at our flag . " It 's safe now ! Not anybody on this campus that can climb that tree now . " Ickie was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where our flag waved . And there was n't a piece of bark left on it big as a matchbox.  | It was last April when I met Effie . It was over at the PutOffFord at the Baptis foot-washing . Effie is a Slab Baptis . She was there having her feet washed . And I ca n't forget that day in April . It is always work in the spring . Fence to fix . Plowing to do . Cattle to tend to . Seems like everything is to do in the spring on the place . Planting crops is the big job . We do n't have no place to go only to church and we do n't feel like going there only on Sunday . That is the day we have off and we do n't have that day off until we 've milked seven cows and slopped the hogs and got in wood and got up water for the day . I ca n't forget that Sunday in last spring when I met Effie . I just packed in the last load of wood and Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall for a woman sometime so hard that it 's going to hurt you . Run around and talk about Mort Anderson being in love and how silly he is . Wait till you fall in love once . The love bug is going to bite you right over the heart . " 138p139I went to the baptizing with a clean white starched shirt on and a blue necktie and blue serge pants and black slippers . I looked about as good in them as I can look . I felt good just to get off to the foot-washing . I remember that row of elms along Little Sandy River had just started to leaf out . The rest of the hills just had a few sycamores and poplars down along the creeks that had leafed a little . It was a pretty morning . And down by the ford I never saw as many people in my life gathered at that one place . And I 've seen a lot of baptizings there . Horses hitched to the trees with ropes and bridle reins . Wagons here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families rid miles in them to the footwashing . And horses eating yaller corn out'n the wagon beds of a lot of the wagons . I just walked down where they 's singing " Where the Healing Waters Flow . " It was soft music and I wished I was a child of the Lord 's then . Good people , the Baptis is ; we live neighbors to them . Ai n't no better people to help you out in a time of sickness or weedy crops in the spring . Come right in and help you out . Now on this bank and washing feet . I walked down along the edge of the river where the horseweeds had been tromped down . I just wanted to look the crowd over . A whole row up and a whole row down . The row standing up was a-washing the feet of them on the ground . Just setting there on the ground as unconcernedand washing feet . Then they would sing another verse of " Where the Healing Waters Flow . " I looked up in front of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prettiest woman I ever saw in my life . She was prettierthan a speckled pup . Honest I never saw anything like her . Eyes that just looked at you and melted like yellow butteron hot corn bread , blue kind of eyes , and a face that was smooth as silk and cheeks the color of the peeling on a Roman Beauty apple in September . Her hair was the color of golden corn silks in August hanging from the shooting corn . Hairp140pretty and curly waving in the wind . I never saw a woman so pretty in my life . Her hands did n't look to me like no hands that had held to the hoe handle like my mother 's hands and my sisters ' . Her hands were pretty and soft . Her teeth were white as a bubble of foam in the Sandy River . She was an angel among the sinners trying to come clean . My heart beat faster when I saw her . Some man had his back to me . He was washing her foot . He had an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homemade soap made from oak-tree ashes . He 'd put it on her foot like he was putting axle grease on a wagon hub . Then he would smear it with his hands and rub . Then he would take the towel and dry her foot till it would look pink as a wild crab-apple blossom . I just stood there and looked at her . She looked at me . He saw her looking and he looked around . Of all the big ugly devils I ever saw in my life it was this fellow , Jonas Pratt 's boy , Tawa Pratt . Lived down on Little Sandy on that big farm in the bend by the grove of cedars . When he turned around and saw me looking he said , " Ai n't you a Baptis ? " And I said , " No , I ai n't no Slab Baptis . I 'm a Methodist and I go to Plum Grove to church . " " Go on about your business then , " he said , " and leave us Baptis alone . This ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord . " I could see he just did n't want me to see the girl . He did n't like me . I did n't like him . I do n't care if he was worshiping the Lord . And I says to him , " If that 's the way you feel about it , all right . But I want to know the name of the girl here with you and where she lives . " That burnt him up . His lips just spread out and he showed them big yaller horse-teeth in front . I just thinks to myself , " What woman could kiss that awful mouth behind them big  |p141horse-teeth  ? " He looked at me with them black polecat eyes and his hair was right down over his eyes . He was a sorrylookingdevil . , The girl says to me , " I 'm Effie Long . I live up on Duck Puddle . " I never said a word . I 'd go to Duck Puddle . That 's just down on Little Sandy four miles and up a hollow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knowed right then and there I 'd see that woman again . I said to myself as I walked back from the riverbank over through horseweeds , " That 's my wife if I can get her . Pretty as a angel right out of Heaven . " I thought of what Mom told me . I would fall for a skirt . I did like the looks of that woman . I went home . I remember it like it was just one hour ago . The daisies looked good to me . First time flowers ever did look good to me . I pulled off the top of a sweet William and smelt it . It smelt sweet as sugar . " The love bug 's got me right over the heart , " I said to Mom soon as I got in at the door . " I saw my wife at the footwashing  --  overthere among the Baptis today at the Put-Off Ford . " And Mom she says , " Elster , you ai n't fell for no Slab Baptis , have you ? No Slab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's been converted into the Methodist faith . That bunch all running around and drinking licker . Wo n't see no licker in Heaven nor no spittoons for that old terbacker . " That 's how women are . Right half of the time . When a man is in love , what does he care for spittoons in Heaven and bad licker or good licker ? What does he care who a Methodist is or a Slab Baptis is ? He wants his woman . That 's the way I felt . Mom married Pop fifty years ago and she do n't know what it is to be young and be in love . I just never said a word . A week had n't passed till I heard about church down onp142Duck Puddle . Slab Baptis holding a pertracted meeting down there . I put on a white starched shirt , a blue necktie and blue serge pants and my black slippers and I went down there . It was a awful walk through the brush and over them ridges . But I followed the fox hunters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I walked across the rocks at the riffle and hit the big wagon road up to the church . Meeting was a-going on when I got there . I had to stop and ask four or five times before I found the place . A pretty place after a body gets there but a devil of a time getting to it . I never went insidethe house till I peeped in at the winders and looked over the house to see if I could see Effie . I looked and looked . And one time when I looked with my eyes up agin the winderpanes the Slab Baptis preacher said , " A lot of pilferers on the outside of the house tonight . The devil in sheep 's clothing is out there . Methodists are snooping around . " When I heard this I slipped back in the dark . I 'm a Methodist and could n't be nothing else . Methodist church is good enough for Pa and Morn and Grandpa and Grandma and it 's good enough for me . Even if they do n't want me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while . I slipped back to the winder . I had looked every place but the amen corner . I looked up there and saw the angel I had seen over at the ford . She was in a mighty good place to be . Me a Methodist and out in the dark . I picked up courage and just walked up and bolted in at the door . I found an empty seat and I saw Effie start looking at me . I started looking at her . And I looked up there and saw old Tawa too . Iie was in the amen corner . He started showing them teeth soon as he saw me . And I thinks to myself , " Old boy , one of these days I 'm going to get me a rock and knock them ugly teeth down your throat . Running around here with a set of horse-teeth in your mouth . " The crowd looked at me . A lot of them had seen me at thep143Methodist church . A lot of them had seen me at the foot-washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the Harkreaders are all Methodist , every last devil of them ! I just waited till church was out . I was going to take Effie home . And I had my mind made up . If that horse-toothed thing of a Tawa should come around me and started anything , it would just be too bad . I was going to use my fists long as they would stand it . I got bad bones in my little fingers . And after my fists I was going to knife it with him and after that if he whopped me I was going to use the balance of power . I carried it right in my pocket . The prettiest little twenty-two you ever saw in your life  --  could put five balls betweenyour eyes before you could say " Jack Robinson . " I do n't go into no strange territory unless I go prepared for the worst . That 's the way we got to do here . I do n't care if we are Baptis and Methodist . The preacher was saying , " Men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I got to work in mine , we 'll call the meeting tomorrow night at seven . All of you be here and bring your songbooks . Sing Almost Persuaded , ' folks , and all who wants to come up and jine us just come right on . " I never saw so many people fall at the altar . Church was out and the people already saved . The young people went home and the old people stayed to pray with the people at the " mourners ' bench . " They was just a-going on something awful . A lot of them were sheep that had left the Methodist flock too . A bunch that wanted to stay in our church and drink licker and play cards and we just would n't have it in Plum Grove . Effie come right down the aisle and I said , " Honey , how about seeing you home tonight ? " I know my face got red when she said , " All right . " Here was old Tawa right behind her with that crazy grin showing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted any/thing he could get it on this night . I did n't speak to him . No use to hide it . He did n't like me and I did n't like him . I got Effie by the arm , and I held it like a leech . We did n't speak . We just walked out of the house and past a bunch of boys at the door waiting for their girls and the other fellow 's girl . People just looked at us . Boys lit up their cigarettes and pipes and the old men started spitting their ambeer . A lot of the women lit up their pipes too : old long-stemmed clay pipes . Something you do n't see around our church at Plum Grove among them already saved . If they done it they went home or out behind the brush . I had n't got out from under the oak trees by the church house till I had Effie by the hand . And I said , " Honey , I ca n't eat , drink , work , nor sleep for thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by the little soft hand , and she looked up at me and said , " Ai n't it funny ? I feel the same way about you . I have felt that way ever since I saw you at the foot-washing . I ca n't forget you . I keep thinking about you . When I saw you tonight I was thinking about you . " I just squeezed her hand a little harder and I said , " Was you , honey ? " Then we went on out the path without speaking . We went out past the Duck Puddle graveyard . White tombstones gleaming there in the moonlight . Lord , it was a sad thing to think about . I wondered what had become of old Tawa . It was a little dark even if the moon was shining . I did n't care , though . I had Effie . I did n't blame him for loving her , but I just did n't want him to get her . I guess we went through twenty pairs of drawbars before we come to Effie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of a bank , pretty with flowers in the yard . I 'd always thought flowers was for the womenfolks . I told Effie I 'd never liked flowers till I met her . I told her everything like that.  |p145We  just went up to her door . I said a lot about the crops . Before I started to leave we was standing out at the well gum . The moon come down upon her old log house there among all them roses and flowers . It was a mighty pretty place . Effie said , " Guess I 'd better get in the house and get to bed . Got to work tomorrow . " And I said , " Where , honey ? " " In the terbacker field , " she said . And then I said , " W'y , you do n't work in no terbacker and stay as white as you are . " She said , " That 's all you know about it , Elster . I use stockinglegs on my arms and a sunbonnet . " And I says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry you . " I just pulled her up to me and kissed her there in the moonlight . Soon I left her there and run over the hill like a dog . Tears come into my eyes . Just to think about that . I used to laugh at such stuff . Now , I had six or seven miles to walk home and blue Monday and the plow before me the next day . But seeingEffie was worth a dozen trips like this . When a man is in love he just do n't care . I went to bed that night  --  must have been morning . It was after the roosters crowed for midnight . Lord , but I was tired . I just could see Effie . I could pull her up to me and kiss her . I could see her eyes , I could see her teeth . I could see her log house in the moonlight . I just could n't forget it all . I got up and et my breakfast . Drunk two cups of black coffee and went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn and look off into the wind . Pa come up to me and he said , " Elster , what in the devil and Tom Walker 's got into you here lately ? Just go around with your head up in the air dreaming . W'y , you even stop when you are shaving your face . If I did n't see you the otherp146day shave half of your face and put the razor up I 'm a liar . " I never said anything , for it was the truth . I just could n't help it for thinking about Effie . I went out to plow corn . I took the mule and the doubleshovelplow and went down the path by the barn . I did n't pay any attention but I started to plow on the wrong side of the field and was plowing up the corn . I could n't think about anything but Effie and how I run away and left that night with my eyes filled with tears . Then I thought , " W'y , I must be crazy to act like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy as I was . I ca n't laugh like I did . She did n't say she would marry me . That 's it . That 's what 's the matter . " I just could n't get back to see Effie that week . I had too much to do . Too much corn to plow and seven cows to milk . Well , I went out to work Tuesday morning . I could n't work . I thought I 'd go up and see Uncle Tid Porter . He lives right on the bank above us . He gives us boys a lot of advice . Uncle Tid was in the woodyard whacking off a few sticks of stovewood . I walked up and I said , " Uncle Tid , I 'm in love with a girl . I ca n't sleep . I ca n't work . I ca n't do anything . I 'm going crazy . " You ought to have seen Uncle Tib sling his ax agin the ground and laugh . You know Uncle Tid is a pretty good doctor when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarb remedies and he does pretty well . Used to be the only doctor in this section . Now , he gives us advice along with spring tonics of slippery-elm bark , shoe-make bark , and ginsang and snakeroot . " Well , " said Uncle Tid , shaking his long thin chin whiskersstained with a little terbacker juice  --  his blue walled eye squinted a little  --  " when did you meet this girl and where is she from ? " " I met her last month at the Slab Baptis foot-washing atp147the Put-Off Ford . She 's from Duck Puddle . She 's a beauty , too , Uncle Tid . W'y , Uncle Tid , to tell you the truth , I never loved a flower till I met her . Now I notice them . See the wild rose in bloom in the woods . I noticed them this morning . She is with me everywhere I go . I ca n't sleep . I ca n't eat . " " It 's love in the spring , " said Uncle Tid . " Love in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be too sure of yourself and jump in and try to marry . Wait a while . Just go out and watch life in the spring . Go to the house and put the mule in the pasture . Take the afternoon off and go to the pond and watch the frogs . Go find some blacksnakes in love and watch them . Watch the terrapins and the turtles . Everythingis in love now . Listen to the songs of the birds . Listen how they sing to each other . It is time to be in love . All the earth is in love now . And love is so uncertain in the spring . " I just got on the mule and went back home . I took the harness off old Barnie and put it on the stall in the barn and I slapped him with the bridle and made him skiddoo to the pasture . I laid up the drawbars and I made for the pond . There 's a lot of bull grass there and about a foot of water . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise ! I slipped up by the pond . They all hushed . I never heard anothernoise only I heard some plump-plumps into the water . I saw that I 'd scared them . So I laid down on my belly behind a bunch of bull grass out of sight from the frogs . It was n't two minutes before they all started singing . The old frogs did n't do much singing . They 'd get up on a log and jump off and chase each other . I crawled up to the edge of the pond and watched them . If you do n't believe young frogs love in the spring when they are doing all of that hollering you just go around the pond and see for yourself . When I got up to leave there , I heard the birds singing . They sung their love songs to each other and it seemed like Ip148could understand some of the words . But the prettiest thing I saw was two snakes entwined upon the bank in the sun . They were blacksnakes and very much in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have picked me up a rock and killed them because Pa says they kill all the birds and young rabbits . I saw two turtles out in the pond on a log . They were bathing in the sun . I just watched them a while . No wonder I fell in love with Effie , pretty a girl as she is . No wonder , I dream of her at night and plan a house to take her to . My mother 's bread do n't taste as good to me as it used to taste . My bed at home do n't look as good as it used to look and home and Mom and Pa do n't seem the same . I just ca n't help feeling that way . I dream of the way Effie is going to bake my bread and fix my bed and clean my shirts and patch my pants . Life is great ; and to be in love , love is so much greater . It 's about one of the greatest things in the world  --  to be in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about the house I had in mind and it was altogether different to the house here where we live . Just to see Effie with a blue dress and a little white apron on , lifting big white fluffy biscuits out of the pan , white biscuits with brown tops , and good hot gravy made out of milk , and butter yaller as a daisy eye , and steam off my coffee hot as hell and strong as love ! I just thought , " Well , I 'm going to tell Pa and Ma that I am leaving them . That I am going to marry that little Slab Baptis and hunt me a home and help to replenish the earth with a good stock . A body can look at her and tell that she is of good stock and I ai n't of such bad stock . " I went to the house . I never got the mule back out of the pasture . I was through . Of course I knowed Pa would hate to see me go and it would break Mom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Methodist and it would kill her to see me marry one of them Slab Baptis that drink licker and bet onp149chicken fights and play cards . But no use to lie to Mom about it . I would go today and fix everything up . Frogs could fall in love and the birds and snakes and terrapins and lizards  --  well , why did n't I have the same right ? And if Pa put his jib in I would tell him to stay out of my love affair and Uncle Tid Porter too . It may be love in the spring but I loved in the spring . I 'll never forget going into the house . Mom was making biscuit dough . I heard Pa telling her I put the mule up and knocked off for half a day . Pa did n't like it and he was worried . " Well , " I says to Mom , " I got news for you . " And Mom says , " What kind of news , Elster ? " And I says , " I am going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who are you going to marry ? " says Pa , his neck and face red as a hen 's comb in the spring . " I am going to marry Effie Long , that little girl I met over at the foot-washing last month , " I said to Pa . " One of them Slab Baptis ? " said Pa . " Yes , one of them Slab Baptis , " I said . " And you been raised under a roof like this one , " Mom said , " under a Methodist roof , and then go and marry a Slab Baptis , one that has a religion that believes in drinking and playing poker and betting on rooster fights and spitting at cracks in the crib floor . Then you going to marry one of them kind . Remember , Elster , if you get burnt you got to set on the blister . You are brought up to believe a certain way it is hard to break away from . Elster , your people have been Methodistfor nearly a hunderd years . And you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darken my door . You can come back when you want to but you be sure you keep her away . " The tears come from Mom 's eyes . Pa put his hands up over his eyes.  |p150And  I said to Mom , " Home here ai n't the same any more since I met Effie . Life ai n't the same . I tell you . My bed ai n't the same upstairs and the good biscuits ai n't the same . " " Your Ma 's bread is the same . Good as it was twenty years ago . Best cook in the country . Then you talk about the bread and even your bed upstairs . Son , I 'm not going to stand for anything like that . You can get out of this house if that is the way you feel about things around here . Get your clothes and go . " Pa said it and his voice kinda quivered . I went upstairs and got my clothes . It did n't take me long , for I do n't have many . Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . Life with Effie and I 'd never come home to see the boys and Mom and Pa . I 'd stay away till they would be glad to see me . That 's what I 'd do . They 'd have to send to Duck Puddle to get me . I put my clothes into the newspaper and got my work clothes  --  my heavy shoes and my Sunday shoes and my twenty-two pistol . I thought it might come in handy about a home of my own . I went down through the front room . Mom was crying . " Ai n't you going to eat a bite before you leave ? " Mom said . And I said , " Nope , I do n't believe I care for anything to eat . " " Take a piece of hot corn bread and butter it and eat a piece of smoked ham as you go . " I took it . Lord , but it tasted good . I had et Mom 's cooking for eighteen years and it was good . But I went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till fall . Could n't plant any ground that late . I was going to marry early enough to rent some ground and get out a late crop and pray for a late fall so they would ripen . I could make it all right . I walked out into the sunlight . It was a pretty day in May.  |p151I  never felt so good in all my life . Had my clothes under my arm and going to get my sweet Effie  --  sweeter than the wild red rose . I went down past the barn and I said farewell to the milk cows , Boss , Fern , Star , Daisy , Little Bitty , Roan , and Blacky . I waved my hands to them and to Pete and Barnie in the pasture , mules I 'd worked many a day . Barnie nickered at me . He walked along the pasture fence far as he could follow me . I 'd been his master ever since he was a colt . Now he would get another master . I said good-by to the trees , the barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Sky was pretty above me . The birds never sung any sweeter for me . The wind had music in it . Flowers bloomed so pretty by the road , whole hillsides covered with wild roses . ' Well , when I got to the riffles the sun was getting pretty low on tother hill . I knowed it would soon be time for them to come from the fields . I 'd just get in there a little after suppertime . Lord , but I was hungry . I got across the rocks at the riffle all right , and I went right up the creek till I come to the church house . I was moving fast to get there before dark . A little moon in the sky already . I crossed the ditch by the church and took out toward the first pair of bars . If I ever go over a road once I never forget it . I soon came to the second pair of bars . The moon was a little bigger in the sky . One of them quarter moons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up . Darkness had come at last but here was the house . Light in the front room . So I goes up and looks in . There was old Tawa . He was setting on the couch beside of my Effie . I knocked on the door . Effie come to the door . I said , " How are you , honey ? " and I just closed her in my arms . Old Tawa showed them big horse-teeth with that funny grin , them polecat eyes just a-snapping . " Come here , Mart Long , " Tawa hollered.  | " Come where ? " said a voice from upstairs . I heard him getting out of the bed . Sounded like the whole loft was coming in . Must a been a big feller . " What are you coming here for ? " said Tawa . " If it 's any your business , " I said , " I 'm coming here to marry Effie . That 's why I 've come . " " You ai n't getting Effie , " said Tawa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her kind . I am a Slab Baptis . I ai n't no damned infidental . " I thought I 'd take my twenty-two out and blow his lights out . Calling me a infidental . I never did like the Methodists so much as I did now . And I said , " Who in the hell are you calling a infidental ? You polecat , you . I 'll clean this floor with you . " I started to turn Effie loose and get him . Just then in stepped Sourwood Long , Effie 's pap . " There 's our infidental Methodist , " said Tawa to Sourwood . And Sourwood said , " W'y , he just looks like the rest of us . Got eyes like us and a mouth and talks . W'y , he 's like the rest of us ; only I do n't want Effie marrying you until you repent and get into our church . " " I have come after Effie right now , " I said . " Besides , I am a Methodist . I do n't intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Methodist church ? What 's wrong with us ? " " And what 's wrong with us ? " said Sourwood . Black beard covering his face . His arms were big as fence posts and hairy as a brier thicket around a old fence row . He kept them folded upon his big hairy chest . He did n't have many teeth . Had a lot of snags in his mouth , a big nose , and he was dark as a wet piece of chestnut bark . " Nothing ai n't wrong with us , " said Tawa . " We are the only people right . You know we got a lot of them Methodistsp153in our church when the pertracted meeting was going on . Left your church for ours . " " You got a lot that could n't stay in our church , " I said . I was ready to fight . I still had Effie in my arms . I had n't turned her loose yet . " You ai n't going to marry Effie . I would n't have one of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family to put up with you a lifetime . Get out of here right now . " Another voice from upstairs . " Sourwood , what 's going on down there ? " " Malinda , what are you doing up there ? A Methodist has come to get Effie . Come on down here . " " Better let a Methodist have her than that thing down there . That Tawa . Get ' em both out of here . Get ' em out quick . " I never saw Effie 's mother . I do n't know how it was done . It was done so quick . Old Tawa must a come around the back side of the house and upon the front porch and hit me over the head with something . I remember I waked up out in the yard . My clothes were under my head for a piller . The moon was in the sky . It just seemed like I 'd been asleep and had slept a little too long . Seemed like a dream . Lights all out of the house just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , I guess . Do n't know what ever become of Tawa . Have never seen him from that day to this . I can hardly tell you how I got home . I was about half-crazy from that lick . I remember I was so hungry . I remember , too , the chickens were crowing for the daylight . I did n't have my twenty-two on me . It was gone . Mom was getting breakfast . I went in and I said , " Mom , your biscuits are all right . Lord , I can eat twenty-two this morning . I 'm so hungry . " " Where 's your wife ? " Mom said.  | " I took another notion , " I said . " I remembered what you said . I did n't want one of them infidentals after we 've been Methodists so long . I thought it over and changed my mind . " " I thought you would , " said Mom . " A boy with your raisingand get into a mix-up like that . Could n't bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own kind . I 'm making you some good strong coffee . " " Good strong coffee is what I need . Strong as love but not love in the spring . Love in the fall . Coffee hot as hell , too . " Lord , but Mom did look good to me in that apron . She just looked the best I ever saw her . And her biscuits tasted right , too . " Mom , you are the best girl I 've ever had , " I said and I kinda give Mom a bear hug and she says to this day I cracked a couple of her ribs . She says she can hardly get her breath at times ever since I hugged her . This has been a day in September . Uncle Tid Porter was down today . He said to me , " Now is the kind of weather to fall in love , now while the chill winds blow and the leaves fly , now while the frost has come . The spring is the time to marry and go on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers and all living things . Spring is the time to marry , not the time to fall in love . Love in the spring is fickle as the wind . " " I have often wondered what has become of Tawa , " I said to Uncle Tid , " the fellow that loved the girl I loved last spring . W'y , he 's the ugliest human being I ever saw for to love as pretty a woman as Effie  --  " " She 's married him , I guess , " said Uncle Tid . " That 's the way of a woman . They do the unexpected thing , not knowing which way the wind will blow and if there will be snow or rain tomorrow . That 's what a man likes ; he likes the unexpectedthing. "  |p155The  wind blows outside . The wind is cool Pa is out at the barn putting a roof over the fattening hog pen . Mom is still complaining of her ribs . " I never heard of that but once beforein my life . A teacher came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mort Giggin 's girls  --  it was Ester , l believe  --  and he broke three of her ribs . I tell you he never got another school in this deestrict. "  |p156When  Grandma Shelton left this world , I was standing beside her bed . Doc Braiden , who had long been her doctor , turned to Mom and said , " Her breath is getting shorter , Martha . It wo n't be long . " Then Mom walked away , wringing her hands and crying . And I started crying too . Pa wiped the tears from his suntannedface with a big bandanna . Uncle Mel walked back and forth across the floor . Cousin Grace Shelton ran out on the porch , leaned against the log wall with her face hidden in her arms , and cried like her heart would break . Uncle Jason sat in a big rocking chair with his elbows resting on the chair arms and his face resting in his hands . He did n't cry . He looked silently at the floor and did n't say anything . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before but one , " Uncle Mel said as the tears streamed down his face . " That 's Brother Jeff . For I know where my mother is going . She 's going to a place of eternal rest away from the troubles156p157of this world . Mall see Pap and she 'll meet her father and mother and our little sister that left this world at four years old . But Brother Jeff , " Uncle Mel said . " It 's enough to make all of us want to be better men when we think of-the way he acted . " " That 's just what I 'm thinkin ' , " Uncle Jason said . " I 'm a-settin ' here now a-thinkin ' as much about Brother Jeff and the way he acted as I am about poor old Ma 's leavin ' this world . It brings something home to me , " Uncle Jason talked on , shaking his head sadly , " and makes me want to be a better man . Brother Jeff is the one that hurried Ma 's death along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something . But he did n't . Maybe he thought it was a family affair and he 'd better stay out of it lest he might be accused since he 'd been Grandma Shelton 's doctor for the last thirty years of her life . But I thought he wanted to say that Grandma had lived a very long time . This was in August and if Grandma had lived until October she would have been ninety years old . She had lived nineteen years beyond the Good Book 's allotted time of **25;10886;TOOLONG . Grandma had been here a long time . After Uncle Jeff had left this world three years ago when he was sixty-seven , Cousin Grace and I had gone to live with Grandma . I cut the stovewood , milked the cow , kept the yard cut and a garden tended , and did the chores that Uncle Jeff had done . Cousin Grace did the housework and the cooking . She had more help than I had , for Grandma was very active up until she had taken sick three weeks ago . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of her two surviving sons , Cousin Grace and I had to stay with her . She selected us from her twenty-seven grandchildren . Mom , Uncle Jason , and Uncle Mel wanted to send all of their children , let each of them have a stay with Grandma and know her better , but Grandma did n't wantp158that . She had her own ideas about things and she still told her children what to do . Grandma 's little three-room shack , where she had lived all her life , was home to me since I 'd been away from my home three years . It was home to Cousin Grace too . And now I thought of all this , as Grandma lay dying . This home would be no more for us . The shack where Grandma was born , where she went to housekeeping , where she had raised her family , would be deserted now . " Brother Jeff caused Ma more worries than all the other three children put together , " Uncle Mel said to Pa . Pa did n't answer him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in two or three rows with Mom 's brothers and he did n't say anything for or against Uncle Jeff , though Pa had always liked him and he said he was the best Shelton of the name with the exception of the one he had married . " Ma will see all her loved ones but Brother Jeff . " Pa wanted to say something . He twitched his lips . Then he tightened his lips to hold back his tongue . Pa just sat there and watched and listened . " That was it , " Doc Braiden said to Mom who was standing beside him at Grandma 's bedside . " That hissing little sound was the last breath . " Mom , Uncle Mel , and Uncle Jason took on something awful . Only Uncle Jason did n't carry on like Mom and Uncle Mel . Cousin Grace cried harder than ever on the front porch when she heard Doc Braiden say that was Grandma 's last breath . I cried harder too when I saw Doc Braiden pull the quilt , one that Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , in the little half-bed by the window . " When the Savior calls , there 's not anything a doctor can do , " Doc Braiden said , as he picked up his medicine kit and started for the front door . " But if I can be of any more help to you , let me know . "  | " I know you 've done all you could for Ma , " Mom wept as Doc Braiden went out the front door . " But her time has come to go . And not any doctor could save her . " " Not when the Master calls , " Uncle Mel said . ' Doc Braiden got in his car that was muddy halfway up the body and drove slowly around the curves and through the mudholes down Big Lost Creek . " We 'd better have somebody here besides the family , " Pa said as he listened to all of us crying . Uncle Jason was crying now . " I 'll go norrate Mother 's death to the neighbors . We 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to make plans for the burial . " Then Pa got up and left the shack . That afternoon , our neighbors kept dropping in until the shack was filled with people . Mallie and John Howard came . Murtie and Uglybird Skinner , Peg and Arn Sparks came . Bertie and Clef Welch came . Sina and Jim Young walked from Plum Grove soon as they heard . These were the older couples that knew my grandma and had lived close to her one time or another . Pa was riding over the hills and up and down the hollers letting the people know of Grandma 's death . Just before suppertime , the young couples came from Lost Creek and Plum Grove . They came and took the kitchen over . They did n't bother to ask Cousin Grace where the food and cooking utensils were . They found everything for themselves and started cooking . Tom Hackless brought his guitar along and he sat beside Maxine Kilgore on the front porch and sang the old hymns and songs , and those that were not weeping or working joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settin ' - up . I had been to them before . I had seen them before . The settin ' - up Grandma had for Uncle Jeff was one we did n't talk about but a lot of people did . They 'd never stopped talking about it . For Uncle Jeff 's friends came andp160many had a time leaving . They had tried to drown their cares and grief about Uncle Jeff 's passing . Everybody knew about Uncle Jeff , and I heard John Howard whisper to Clef Welsh that it was Uncle Jeff , Grandma 's wayward son , who had helped wreck Grandma 's health and bring her to her death . I heard Bertie Welch whisper something to Sina Young about it too . They were all talking about Uncle Jeff , except Mom , Uncle Jason , and Uncle Mel . They were hanging their heads in grief and wiping their tear-stained eyes . I thought Uncle Jeff was gone and forgotten except by his own people . But Grandma 's death had revived everybody 's memory of Uncle Jeff . While we sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stand-table dimly burning , with wick flames fluttering when the wind came in at the open window , I could see a big harvest moon high in the blue sky , flooding the little valley between the hills Grandma had once owned , a farm that had been owned by her people since the beginning of Greenwood County in 18o2 . This was the land she loved and her father had loved , but they had left this land for a Better Land . Uncle Jeff loved this land , too , I thought as I sat there looking through the window at the moon . I wondered if he loved the place where he was now . Then I remembered I did n't have the right to judge . But I heard the people in the room talking about Uncle Jeff and it brought back memories . For Uncle Jeff was the child growing up that Grandma had relied on most . He was always trusty and a good worker and Grandma had often bragged on his " good judgment " when he was a boy . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He married Minnie Weston . When Uncle Jeff got married and got a home of his own , he put into practice some of the ideas he suggested to his father , my grandpa Silas Shelton . Uncle Jeff bought a sawmill on credit and a tract of timber . He sawed the timber on the farm , paid for the landp161and timber and sawmill on his first adventure . Then he rented this land for tobacco and paid for the land and made a nice profit . Uncle Jeff went on and on buying more land and cuttingmore timber and renting his land and raising more tobaccountil he bought all of Culp Creek and started buying the land on Big White Oak . People got afraid of Uncle Jeff . Said if he lived long enough he 'd own all of Greenwood County . People got to the place they would n't sell him land . Then Uncle Jeff would get a trusted friend to buy for him and turn the land over . People got afraid to sell a piece of land to anybody , afraid it would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a nip from a bottle one cold frosty morning at the sawmill to warm him up . He kept on taking nips from the bottle to warm him up . And as time passed and his eight children grew , he kept taking more nips . Uncle Jeff , the wealthiest man in GreenwoodCounty , started selling his land piece by piece . Soon as one of his six sons or his two daughters was eighteen , he married and left the big house that Uncle Jeff owned . For Uncle Jeff 's sons were tired of riding mules over the country to find him . Once he was gone four years . That was after he had sold a Sandy River bottom farm for eleven times as much as he gave for it . That was when Uglybird Skinner said that when a man got too big for his pants something would always happen to him . He said either the devil or the Savior got him and it was usually the devil . That 's when everybody said Uncle Jeff had gone to the devil and all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . When all his children had left their home but two , Aunt Minnie left and went to live with her oldest son , Elbert . When Uncle Jeff had sold all his forty-three hundred acres of land and houses down to the house he lived in and six acres of ground , he started selling his livestock , then his sawmill and farming tools , even his scythes , cradles , tobacco knives ,  |p162and  garden hoes . The last two children , Estille and Essie , left him and went to their mother and oldest brother . Uncle Jeff was left alone and he sold his house and slept in the mouth of a deserted coal mine until Grandma brought him home to her . This was when I got to know Uncle Jeff better . I had to go to Grandma 's when Uncle Jeff went away . He had a mule and an express wagon and he 'd start to Blakesburg when he got a little money and he would n't get back . Sometimes the mule would bring him home . Uncle Jeff would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Grandma and I would always run down to the barn-lot gate and stop under the tall willows . When we could n't see any driver on the seat , we knew Uncle Jeff was laying in the express bed . Then Grandma and I would pull at Uncle Jeff ( and he 'd do all he could under his own power ) to try to get him out and to the shack and put him to bed . Grandma would cry and I would cry as we worked with Uncle Jeff . Many a time he fell from the express bed like a barrel of salt or sugar and hit the ground with a thump . Sometimes that helped him and he stirred more under his own power . But Uncle Jeff was a big man , two hundred and ninety pounds , six feet three inches tall , with big hands , big feet , and a big fine-looking head and a handsomeface with a pair of black eyes that shone like embers in the dark . When Uncle Jeff sold his mule , old Moll , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend . After this , Uncle Jeff , though he said he could n't stand on a hillside and cut sprouts and plow , would walk five miles to Blakesburg faster than I could when he got some money . Once while he was in this condition he got in a church house in the night when the moderator and his congregation was praying to the Savior to tear off the shingles and come down through the roof . Uncle Jeff was sitting quietly in the back corner of thep163house and listening to the service , when the moderator asked for testimonies . Then Uncle Jeff got up and testified . He said it was n't practical for the Savior to come down through the roof and tear off the shingles when there was a door and windows and besides there would be an added expense of fixing the roof . Uncle Jeff was arrested and fined for this and he was laying out a fifty-dollar fine at a dollar a day in GreenwoodCounty Jail when Grandma paid his fine . Once in January I went one cold morning to hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had slept all night . There was an eight-inch snow on the ground , but it was melted all around Uncle Jeff and four or five feet away from him in all directions . Uncle Jeff was wet and steaming and I gave him hot coffee and he was able to get home under his own power . I walked along and held his big hand so he would n't slip and fall on the snow and ice . Everybody , especiallyGrandma , thought he would take pneumonia and die . But he never had a cold . But the worst danger for Uncle Jeff that I remembered before the real thing happened was when he came from Blakesburgand would think he was home and just go to one of the shacks beside the road , open the door , and walk in in the night . This big man was very quiet . When he was like that , he never could talk . He 'd clap his big hands and go " Woo-woo ! " Once he got beside Choppie Thomas 's bed . Choppie was sleeping beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Gracie Thomas heard it first and told Choppie and he told her she did n't hear anything , to go back to sleep and let him sleep . But she heard it again and Choppie heard it . Choppie lit the lamp and there Uncle Jeff stood at the head of their bed , wearing his dark suit , a rose in his coat lapel , and a big black umbrella hat . Choppie reached for his pistol and then lie recognized Uncle Jeff . Uncle Jeff got in Spittie Jackson 's shack once . He got inp164Buffalo Darby 's shack one night . And Fonse Keeney found him in a spare bed in his shack one morning . Then Grandma had to norrate it to the people that Uncle Jeff was harmless when he was like this . That he could n't stand tobacco smoke , cigarette , pipe or cigar , that he did n't chew tobacco , that he did n't drink coffee but he drank milk for breakfast , and that she had never heard him swear an oath in her life . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blakesburg 's marshal , Ellis Cantwell , the same thing . Because Ellis Cantwellwould use a billy club and I did n't want him to billy Uncle Jeff . When Dink Callihan , the short red-headed sexton at Plum Grove , and Wilburn Clifton walked into the room , Wilburn had a rule in his hand . They had come to measure Grandma to make the coffin . Then Bertie Welch and Arn Sparks took the rule and measured Grandma under the cover . There was a lot of crying and grief in the front room where Grandma lay dead , but in the kitchen where people were eating and drinking there was a lot of noise . There was the rattle of dishes and cups and saucers . There was the clanking of knives , forks , and spoons . While out on the porch there was the sweet music of a guitar and soft voices under the moonlight . Though Grandma was dead , there was more life in her shack than I had ever seen . As soon as Wilburn had the measurements so he could know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how big to dig the grave , they left the shack very quietly as I had seen them leave many shacks before . They knew just how to do it in a very sad way . At nine o'clock , Clara Braiden , who was blue-eyed with blond hair and very pretty , brought food and hot coffee into the room and passed it around among the grief-stricken who were sitting up with Grandma . As soon as she had left the room Sina Young whispered : " Clara 's in love with Tom Hackless . Too bad she ca n't sit beside him in Maxine Kil/gore 's place and listen to that sweet music . If she could , " Sina whispered hoarsely in Bertie Welch 's ear , " she would n't be in the kitchen a-cookin ' and waitin ' on us . " At about ten o'clock Mallie Howard , who was looking at Grandma 's bed , said , " I thought I saw the quilt move . " " You 're gettin ' afraid , " Uglybird Skinner said . Then Uglybird laughed a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time anybody had laughed in this room on this night . " When you stare at something , Mallie , as I 've watched you a-starin ' at Grandma Shelton 's deathbed , " John Howard , her husband , explained , " you 'll think you see something move whether it does or not . Your eyes will play tricks on you , especially in the night at a time like this when everybody is upset . " Then all was very quiet in the room and everybody looked at one another . They have stopped talking about Uncle Jeff for one time tonight , I thought . When the hand of Grandma 's old Seth Thomas clock on the mantel was just about at ten-thirty , Mallie Howard let out a scream . " What 's the matter with you , Mallie ? " John Howard asked . " Are you a-gettin ' nervous ? Will I have to take you home ? " " I guess it 's just in my head , " she answered , looking at the floor . " But I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma Shelton 's hands ought to be ! " Uglybird Skinner put his hand over his mouth to keep from laughing . " Do n't be afeard , Mallie , " Sina Young said . " Rejoice at the death and grieve at the birth . When you come to think of all the grief , sin , and misery in the world , these are the words for a body to remember . " Just when the clock was striking eleven , there was louder talking , laughing , and clanking of dishes in the kitchen andp166faster music and louder singing on the porch . Clara Braiden entered the front room with a pot of hot coffee and a tray of teacups and saucers . But she did n't get to the center of the room when she walled her eyes , let out a scream , and dropped the coffeepot and the tray of cups and saucers . She stood there and trembled like a leaf in the wind while she screamed . Then she got control of herself , left the room screaming out onto the porch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's alive , " she screamed as she left , running down the road for home . There was silence in the room as everybody looked at the bed and at each other . I looked at the bed and I did n't see the quilt move . But the talking and laughing stopped in the kitchen and the young couples on the porch were thrown into disorder . The guitar-strumming and the singing stopped when Clara Braiden ran among them screaming and off down the road . A few of the young people took off too , for I saw them running down the road from the window . " Maybe it 's our dead ancestors back in this room , " Uncle Mel said . " Speak to us if you are , " Uncle Jason said . " It 's something , " Mallie Howard said . " I do n't believe my eyes deceived me . " " Let 's be practical about this , " my father said . " If Mother Shelton is still alive , there is a way to tell . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the silent faces stared at him , " do n't anybody get scared . " " How can we tell ? " Mom asked . " Hold a mirror before her and tell whether she 's breathing or not , " Pa said . Not one of the women would do it . Pa got Grandpa Silas Shelton 's little shaving mirror , where Grandpa had kept it years ago and Grandma had never moved it , and he turnedp167back the quilt and held it before her . Pa was n't afraid but the women turned their heads and they certainly did n't talk about Uncle Jeff and Clara Braiden now . When Flossie Flyman came into the room she threw up her hands , ran back to the kitchen screaming , and everybody started taking off . " She bath risen from the dead , " Flossie screamed , nearly causing panic among the people at the settin ' - up . Jackie Bowlen left the road and ran into a swamp beside the big sycamore and mired up to his waist . Young people were running in all directions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's alive ! " Then Mallie Howard ran out at the door with John Howard after her . Sina Young jumped from her chair to go and Jim Young grabbed her . Arn Sparks filled her pipe with tobacco and puffed one cloud of smoke after another . Cousin Grace fell to her knees and started praying . Mom shook until I thought she 'd fall . Uncle Mel could n't speak . Uncle Jason trembled until he could n't speak and had to hold onto the mantel , his long legs were trembling so . " She 's moving more , " Pa announced so everybody could hear . " I 've got this quilt from over her head so she can get more air ! " Pa stripped the quilt down to her waist . There lay Grandma in her flowered nightgown . I saw her hand move . She was trying to lift it . " No use to hold this mirror to her now , " Pa said . " Mother Shelton is alive . She 's getting more alive all the time . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not anyone in the kitchen or on the porch . Sina and Jim Young had gone . Peg and Arn Sparks had slipped out . Murtie Skinner jumped up to go but Uglybird would n't let her . He grabbed her by the arm . " Stay , Murtie , " he said . " Let 's see where she has been and who she 's seen . " " Water , " Grandma whispered to Pa.  |p168Then  Cousin Grace ran into the kitchen and fetched a glass of water . Pa held it to Grandma 's mouth and she sipped a few drops . Then more life came and she raised her hand . " More water , " she whispered . " My mouth is dry . " Pa gave her more water to sip . Then Grandma moved her body . " More water , " she whispered a little louder , " and I 'll tell you where I 've been and who I 've seen . " Pa lifted her head a little higher with one hand and held the glass with the other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she whispered between sips . Now Grandma was beginning to move like I had seen her move before . Pa put a pillow behind her and lifted her up some . A little color was coming back to her face . " I 've been to Heaven , " Grandma whispered , but we could hear for the shack was quiet now . " I 've been on a long journey . " Then Pa held the glass and Grandma sipped more water . Uncle Mel , Uncle Jason , and Mom stood beside Grandma 's bed , looked on , and trembled . Bertie and Cief Welch stood beside them . Uglybird and Murtie Skinner stood close . Pa , Cousin Grace , and I stood beside Mom . " The Savior smiled at me after I stumbled up a long dark path and entered the gates of Heaven , " Grandma said . " He beckoned me through where my friends and loved ones were waiting ! " Then Grandma took a bigger sip of water . " Did Pap meet you , Mother ? " Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " Grandma said . " I 'm sorry . " Then Grandma was silent and Pa gave her more water . Uncle Mel , Uncle Jason , and Mom looked at each other with tear-stained eyes in red sockets . " But you 'll get a surprise when I tell you your brother Jeffp169met me , " Grandma said with light in her dimmed eyes . " Jeff is there and you would n't know him . He 's a fine-looking man and all straightened up . My mother and father were there . Looked just the way they used to look . Mother wearing a little checked apron with a pocket in the corner . " I wanted to ask Grandma more about Uncle Jeff , but words came hard for her and she wanted to tell so much about where she had been and who she had seen but she had to rest and sip water . " I told you about your brother Jeff , " Pa said to Mom . " Everything Jeff teched turned to gold but it was n't Jeff 's fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he done a little better than they did and drove Jeff to one thing . Not Jeff but the people will pay for what they done to him . Jeff was a square man . He just traded with people . Jeff never wronged a woman , never lied , stole as much as a hen egg , swore an oath , or hurt an animal . Jeff Shelton was a good man . I 'm not as surprised as you are , " Pa talked on , looking directly at Uncle Mel and Uncle Jason , the two of Mom 's brothers he 'd never cared for . " Jeff had a heart . Something good about Jeff . He fooled you , did n't he ? Well , " Pa added with a smile , " he did n't fool me . He did n't pretend . He was n't a hypocrite ! " " I saw little Helen , too , " Grandma said . " I would have never knowed her . She 's a woman now . Children grow in Heaven . She had to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Jeff , " Pa asked Grandma . " I was proud to see him , " Grandma said . " I 'm so happy . But I expected to see Silas . But he was n't there . That 's what hurts . " Murtie Skinner doddled her head until Uglybird had to put his arm around her shoulder and hold her . " Did you see my father and mother ? " Uglybird asked  | " I saw Maude but I did n't see Little Jack , " Grandma said . " I saw so many of my old neighbors . But I did n't have time to talk with them . " Little Jack Skinner had been a great land-grabber . He 'd stolen hundreds of acres of land . I remembered when he died how glad everybody was that he had left this world . For people were afraid of him . But I did n't know about Grandpa Shelton for I was a child when he left the world and I 'd not heard much said about him one way or another . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Saw both of them , " Grandma whispered . " They look just like they always did . " Then Grandma sipped more water and she said , as she looked toward Murtie Skinner , " I saw your sister Kate there and your father Les and your mother Agnes . I used to know ' em a long time ago . They wanted to ask me questions but I did n't have time . For the Savior beckoned again . It was to go , " Grandma whispered sadly . " I even saw my grandpa and grandma , Mary and Kennealas Wright , there , " Grandma whispered . " They looked like people from a different world the way they were dressed so old-fashioned . Saw horsetrader Jim Lyons there . Everybody said he was a lost sinner and sich a bad man . I saw him in Heaven . Saw John Pratt and Leanie Skaggs . So many I can remember just now of old neighbors and friends who came with Mother , Jeff and Little Helen , Grandpa and Grandma Wright to meet me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beckoned me back . He said , Go back and come again . ' He sent me back for a purpose , " Grandma whispered in little breaths , looking at Uncle Mel and Uncle Jason . " I hated to leave Heaven and come back here . " Then we stood in silence and looked at Grandma . " But I 'll just be here on the footstool a few more years , " Grandma said.  |p171Uglybird  looked at Cief and they looked at Uncle Jason and Uncle Mel . Morn looked at me and Cousin Grace and then she looked at her mother there on the bed talking in her right mind , for she had always had a right mind . " This is something , " Uglybird Skinner said . " It makes a man think . " " You 'd better go see Dink and Wilburn , " Pa said to Uglybird . " Tell them before they start work . " " Go tell Dink and Wilburn I 'd want them to go ahead if it would take me back where I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mother , you 're goin ' to be all right , " Pa said . " You need rest . You can tell us more tomorrow . We do n't want you to talk too much tonight . Soon as you are able you 'll have a lot of people to tell your story . But now , " Pa added , " what you need is rest . " Then Pa removed the pillow and let her lie back down . He pulled up the quilt over Grandma . Mom , Uncle Mel , and Uncle Jason , Cousin Grace , and I stayed at Grandma 's and Murtie and Uglybird Skinner walked quietly from the shack out into the night . We knew they would norrate the news Grandma had risen from the dead , that there would not be any more settin ' - up with her another night nor a big funeral at Plum Grove . I was glad that the news about Uncle Jeff from now on would be better.  | It was last spring when Bird-Neck worked on one side the holler and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down below us . It separated Bird-Neck 's cornfield from mine . We 'd holler to each other across the crick . " Eb , if you do n't hurry up you 're goin ' to haf to snake your corn . Weeds and sprouts are goin ' to whop you before you get to the top ! " Bird-Neck would say . Then Bird-Neck would jist laugh and lean against that little crosspiece between the handles o ' his plow . I can jist see old Bird-Neck yet , the way he 'd laugh . Big tall man with iron jaws . He 'd wear big heavy brogan shoes with his toes a-stickin ' out , old overalls with the patches sewed on from th ' outside , a old blue faded work shirt , and a slouched black hat that had gone to seed at the top like a doodle o ' hay . I 'd holler to Bird-Neck , " I wo n't haf to snake my corn . I 'll be at the top o ' my hill before you 're to the top o ' yourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You ought to beat17$p173me , Eb . I 'm forty years nearer the last hill than you are . But in my day and time it took a man to beat me at my work . " Then Bird-Neck would laugh and say , " Get up , Moll . Go along , old gal ! " Bird-Neck was seventy-nine years old . His white hair come down long on the back o ' his neck below the brim o ' his slouched hat . Moll was twenty-nine years old . Her hair was nearly as white as Bird-Neck 's hair . Bird-Neck plowed her without a line . He jist had to tell ' er when to start and stop . I 'd say , " Bird-Neck , you shore to God got a good mule . " Bird-Neck would say , " Yes , old Moll 's a good ' n . She knows more about plowin ' than half the men in this country . " My ground was a lot better . My corn was higher , too . " W'y , your corn ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same old hill when you was a little shaver a-settin ' on your pappie 's knee . That was thirty-nine years ago . That was when Jane was alive . You do n't remember her . Atter she died I let this hill take a rest . It growed up in sprouts and briers again . Then I jumped the broom with Lan Moore 's widder Jenny . Had more young'uns , you know . I had to come back and clear this hill again . I 've purt ' nigh wore out four hunderd acres o ' these old hills in my day . " Then I 'd see Bird-Neck unhitch the trace chains . He 'd wrap ' em around the back straps on Moll 's britchin ' . He 'd jist turn ' er loose by herself . She 'd go up the hill and around the ridge road to the house . Bird-Neck would call Shep . " W'y , he 's so deef , " Bird-Neck would say , " sometimes I jist haf to go out there under the shade o ' that big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's quittin ' time . A dog , like a body , gets old atter a while . Ust to be as good a possum and squirrel dog as there was in the hills . Too old to smell a track now . Jist keep ' em . " Shep would follow Bird-Neck up the hill . Bird-Neck would push down a dead sassafras pole or a dead locust pole ferp174stovewood . He 'd put it on his shoulder and walk up the hill to the ridge road home . He 'd follow the way old Moll went . Shep would follow Bird-Neck up the hill , waggin ' his gray tail . It was in July , I 'd plowed and hoed my corn three times . I was right at the top o ' the hill workin ' on my last row . BirdNeckhad plowed and hoed his corn three times . He was workin ' on the top row . I hollered across to Bird-Neck and says , " You might be forty years nearer the last hill but you 've finished layin ' by your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm done layin ' by my corn now , " says Bird-Neck . " I want you to come over tonight . I 've got a drap in the jug fer both o ' us . " " I 'll be right over , Bird-Neck , " says I. " You know when they 's a drap in the jug you ca n't hold me away . I ai n't had a drap in a long time now . Now that the work is all done , I 'll be right over . " I saw Bird-Neck follow old Moll up the hill . Moll drug the plow home . Old Shep followed at his heels waggin ' his bushy gray tail . Below ' em was his big twenty-acre field o ' corn around the slope jist as clean as a pawpaw whistle ; stumps standin ' there without a sprout growin ' around ' em ; rocks gray and bare layin ' in the corn balks . The corn looked so purty and clean . I put my plow in the shed . I unharnessed the mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et my supper and started out to Bird-Neck 's shack . Jist to tell you the truth about his shack , it 's run down a lot in late years . The clapboards on the roof are green with moss . Horseweeds grow up high as the winders . W'y , it was jist like a groundhog path through the high weeds to get in at the front door . It jist looked to me like the weeds , briers , and the weather had nearly taken Bird-Neck 's shack . I found my way in and knocked on the door . " Come in , Eb , old boy , " says Bird-Neck . He unlatched thep175door . I walked in the room . Bird-Neck did n't have a oil lamp like we got . He had a pine torch . Did n't make much light but a body could see the room purty well . It was a big room . Jist Bird-Neck and old Shep in the house . " Bird-Neck , " I says , " you know what you need ? " " I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' this dirty house , " says Bird-Neck . " But I do n't need a wife , Eb . Not any more . I 've had three . " " You ai n't too old , " I says , " to get you a spouse in your old days to keep you company . " " No more wimmen , " says Bird-Neck . " It 's all over . Here 's my woman now . See ' er right over there in the corner ? Two gallons there fer us tonight . " " It 's a lot o ' licker , " I says , " and I ai n't ust to it . " " Ah , " says Bird-Neck , " fer some o ' you young bucks all you got to do is hit you with a sour apple and you 're drunk . Us old boys could take our licker and take it straight . I 've drunk a gallon a-many a day and done all the plowin ' the mule could stand . Atter the day was over I 'd go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when I was younger . I got a little older and I could still drink my gallon a day . But I did n't go to dances . Tints got a little stiffer . I 'd fox-hunt all night . Jist run the ridges and listen to the hounds . Then Ater I passed the three-score years and seven I started possum huntin ' . Got old Shep here . It war n't as much runnin ' uphill and downhillas fox huntin ' . Then old Shep got too old to smell , so I jist haf to drink my licker now . " " I ca n't take a gallon in a night 's time , " I says . " What is it , that old fightin ' kind o ' moonshine ? " " Nope , " says Bird-Neck , " it 's the best old Steve Howard can make . It 's the kind o ' licker old friends ought to drink on special occasions . " Bird-Neck walked over and picked up the jug . It was a big two-gallon white jug with a brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled me up a chear . He pulled hisself up a chear on th ' other side o ' the stand table . The pine torch burned from a tin pan on the middle o ' the table . Shep laid on th ' old plaited rag rug and snored jist over in front o ' the big empty fireplace . " Well , here it is , " says Bird-Neck , " good old life in the jug before I climb my last hill . Eighty years old tomorrow . I 've reached my four-score . " Bird-Neck takes out the stopper . " We 'll drink from the same jug , my good neighbor and friend ! " he says . I held the jug up . It was a little heavy to hold . It run down my gullet like sand through a sieve . " Bird-Neck , " I says , " that 's the real stuff . It 's as good as I ever tasted . It 's the real yarbs . " " All right , " says Bird-Neck , " I 'll taste o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I climb my last hill . " Bird-Neck holds the jug to his lips . The neck o ' the jug is hid in his snow-white beard and mustache . **41;10913;TOOLONG . The wind blowed through the open winder and sorty made the sparks fly from the torch . The blaze would shoot out long ; then it would draw back again . The black smoke would go off in little streams o ' clouds across the half-lighted room . The lightin ' bugs would come in at th ' open winders and fiddle around in the room and dab their heads against the ceilin ' where the spiders had spinned their webs and the waspers had built their nests . " I 'm ready fer another swig , Bird-Neck , " says I. " It 's the real stuff and I might be able to kill three quarts before mornin ' . " I held the jug up to my lips . It was a lot lighter to hold now , atter we 'd taken a dram apiece . I jist let ' er slide down my throat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no place to go . Jist as well be gettin ' over a little celebration with old Bird-Neck . " Now you 're drinkin ' , my old friend , " says Bird-Neck , " jistp177like your pap ust to do . Your pap could hold his licker . I remember the drunkest I ever was in my life was with your pap . We had two gallons and a half o ' moonshine licker . We 's a-comin ' from th ' old Dysard place . He bantered the drinkin ' half o ' it with ' im . Had it in quart self-sealer jars . Durned if he did n't drink five o ' ' em . I drinked th ' other five . Bill , my oldest boy by my first wife , found us in the corner o ' th ' old rail fence that runs up from that sulphur spring by th ' old Dysard house . We 's layin ' right out in the hot July sun . The lizards was a-runnin ' over us and playin ' . We 's limber as two dishrags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **54;10956;TOOLONG . I 've never seen a man that could drink like Bird-Neck . " The more I drink the better it tastes , " says Bird-Neck . " That 's enough to sorty put the fire in these old lints . Enough to put new blood in this old carcass . " Bird-Neck shoved the jug over my way . " It 's like this , Eb , " says Bird-Neck . " I 'm a lone man in the world . I married Jane , old Alex Hix 's gal . She 's seventeen . I 's eighteen . We had twelve young'uns . All o ' ' em lived , half a dozen gals and a half a dozen boys . But Jane got ' er feet wet one January . She was n't forty then . She took the quick consumptionand passed on to the Better World . Then I married Lan Moore 's widder Jenny . She jist had two young'uns . But they 's spiled ' ns . My young'uns did n't like their young brother and sister and their new ma . So Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He soon had all my first-nest young'uns up there . Left the nest like young birds . But I raised me another litter and filled the nest . I had eight young'uns by Widder Jenny . " She had n't had the measles . When she got ' em , w'y , the Lord called ' er home . I was left a-holdin ' a nest o ' tenp178young'uns . I 's jist sixty then . So I wanted me a helpmate . I married Melvin Sprouse 's old maid gal , Martha , ugly in ' er young days and could n't get a man , but turned out to be purty at forty . We jist had one boy , young Bird-Neck . All the last nest went to Oklahoma . Heard about all that land out there . Jist flew off like a covey o ' quails . I 's in hopes little Bird-Neck would n't go , but when his ma drapped dead nine years ago he said he could n't stay among the hills no longer . So he follered the batch o ' young'uns he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny bore me . So I 'm jist here with old Moll and old Shep and all these old hills I know better'n a book , because I ai n't never read a book . " Bird-Neck put the jug to his lips and gurgled and gurgled . He put the jug back on the table . " I 'm ready fer another little swig , " I says . I put the jug to my lips and I drinked a good swig . " It 's a lot lighter , BirdNeck . We 're dreanin ' the jug . " " Let ' er drean , " says Bird-Neck . " I jist want to tell you now while I 'm in my right mind . I might get drunk and not remember before in the mornin ' , Eb . But the licker in that jug is my blood . " " Your blood ? " I says , " W'y , Bird-Neck , you 're gettin ' drunk shore as God made little green apples . " " No , I ai n't drunk , " says Bird-Neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How much did you get fer yourself ? " I asks . " I got twenty-five dollars , " says Bird-Neck . " Enough to pay my taxes fer another year , two or three little debts I owed , and enough left to buy this two-gallon jug o ' licker . " " Where in the world did you get it ? " I asks . " You ai n't kiddin ' me , are you , Bird-Neck ? " " No , " says Bird-Neck , " I ai n't kiddin ' you . Here 's the way I done it . I heard about the hospital at Goodland where they took bodies and worked on ' em atter they 's dead . "  | " What made you do that , Bird-Neck ? " I says . " Lord , you ai n't no right to traffic in human bodies ; they are the creation o ' God 's handiwork . " " I got the right , " says Bird-Neck , " to trade and traffic on my own body , ai n't I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I 's twenty-one . " " Now at eighty the hospital owns you , " I says , " to stand you up with a pipe in your mouth and shoot you atter you 're dead and then probe fer the bullet . " " Not until I 've climb th ' last hill , " says Bird-Neck . " Jist to tell you th ' truth , Eb , I am sick o ' the bargin . But twentyfivedollars is twenty-five dollars . Got my debts and taxes paid , my corn laid by , got my jug o ' licker . " " I hate to drink your blood , " I says , " but Lord , Bird-Neck , it 's good . It 's jist so lonesome out here by ourselves . So many birds a-hollerin ' and insects a-moanin ' their songs and the wind a-blowin ' . Makes me feel sorty bad to set here and drink your blood . " " Do n't mind that , Eb , " says Bird-Neck . " I do n't think the contract is lawful . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allus paid my just and honest debts . But I 'll be dad-durned if they 're goin ' to get me . I jist laid here in the bed last night and thought it all over . They ai n't goin ' to get me , Eb . I ai n't goin ' to give myself to ' em . I want the birds o ' th ' air and th ' ants on the ground to get my flesh , and the hills to get my bones . I want the winds o ' the mountains to bleach ' em white . That 's the way I feel , Eb . " Lord , I could n't stand that sort o ' talk . It was gettin ' me on one o ' them cryin ' drunks . So I jist turned the jug up and took a big swig . " I feel better now , " I says . Bird-Neck turned the jug up and he jist about dreaned it dry . " He 's drunk , " I thought . " He ai n't sold hisself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonesome here that I start cryin ' , I 'm goin ' home . "  | " Good night , Bird-Neck , " I says , " I 'm goin ' home . I 'm drunk . I 'm goin ' home to Effie and the young'uns . " " Good night ferever , " says Bird-Neck . " Good night ferever . You 've been a good neighbor and a good friend . " I left BirdNeckstandin ' there a-holt o ' the table . The mornin ' wind was comin ' in at the winder and tryin ' to blow the torch out . Old Shep was lookin ' up in Bird-Neck 's dimmin ' eyes and waggin ' his tail . All day Sunday I was in misery . I kept thinkin ' about it all . I jist thought , " Might be somethin ' in it . Old Bird-Neck is a man to laugh and a man fer a lot o ' fun , but he 's allus as good as his word . He might a sold hisself . " It bore on my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the flat between Bird-Neck 's shack and mine . I saw old Moll over in the pasture jist across from me . She looked like a heap o ' skin and bones . She got about and nibbled the tender grass . I could see Bird-Neck 's wheat field from the flat I 's workin ' on . But I did n't see Bird-Neck that Monday mornin ' . It was on Tuesday mornin ' when I went to work that old Shep started howlin ' . He jist howled and howled . He 'd never done that before . He howled as lonesome as a whippoorwill hollers . " Oh , he 's jist old and lonesome , " I thought . " BirdNeckmaybe 's still soberin ' up . I 'll go up and see how he is atter I quit work this evenin ' . " I worked on until six o'clock . W'y , old Shep , it ' peared to me , would go into spasms with his long mournful howls. list like a cow bawlin ' when she 's lost her calf . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went up the crick and took th ' old yaller jolt-wagon road to my left that went up the big hill to Bird-Neck 's shack . I went up to th ' old house . The door was open . Shep was standin ' in the middle o ' the big room floor jist a-howlin ' like his heart wouldp181break . He war n't hungry . The floor was kivvered with hard corn-pone bread Bird-Neck had baked and left fer ' im . " Poor old Shep , " I thought , " your old master told me the truth last Saturday night . He 's sold hisself . He 's drunk too much licker . He thought he 's goin ' to die . He 's gone up to Goodland to die in the hospital . I 'll jist go to the hospital tomorrow and see about old Bird-Neck . " The looks o ' the house was enough to make a man cry . There was our table and th ' empty jug . There was th ' ashes of the rich pine torch on the tin pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital . " Did a feller by the name o ' Bird-Neck Dixon sell hisself to you fer twenty-five dollars ? " I says . " Sure did , " says the doctor . " What of it ? " " Well , he 's gone , " I says . " I was with ' im last Saturday night . We 's on a little celebration together on the money you paid ' im . He 's tellin ' me that he sold hisself and got the money . I did n't believe ' im . Said he paid up his taxes and a few little debts with the money and bought us two gallon o ' moonshine whisky . " " Oh , he did , did he ? Now he 's gone ! I guess we 're cheated again . That 's the danger about buying a living old cuss . " " You ai n't no business nohow , " I says , " a-tradin ' and traffickin ' in human lives . " He stood and looked at me . I got up and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'd never find ' im . He 'd told me they 'd never git ' im , though . I believed Bird-Neck . He would n't die off'n his land if he could help it . Thursday mornin ' Bud Travis , Lew Kendall , Flem Sowards , Mort Kenyon , Blade Terry , Ross Perkins , and me all went to Bird-Neck 's shack . Old Shep had howled until he was hoarse . He follered us to the wheat field . We took hands and went around the mountain slope through the tall golden wheat . Itp182was ripe enough to cut , but it had n't been touched . We went back and forth a-holdin ' hands so we could n't miss Bird-Neck if he 's dead on the ground . We went from one end o ' the field to th ' other , until we reached the top o ' the mountain . Old Shep follered us around through the wheat . " He shore to God ai n't in the wheat , boys , " says Ross Perkins . " He 's sommers else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flem Sowards . " Old Bird-Neck always loved the cornfields , you know . " " Yes , he did . That 's right , " I says . We went over the top o ' the mountain to the cornfield . We began at the bottom o ' the high hill . We took a couple o ' rows o ' corn apiece and went through from one end o ' the field to th ' other until we got to the top . We could n't find Bird-Neck . " He 's not here , either , fellers , " says Bud Travis . " Old Shep is diggin ' atter somethin ' out there under that big shell-barked hickory , " says Lew Kendall . " Jist the shade tree where old Shep ust to sleep when BirdNeckplowed , " I says . " Guess he 's buried a bone ' er somethin ' there , " says Flem Sowards . We went out and stood under the tree . A swarm o ' crows flew over . They saw us under the tree and went on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree big enough to bury a yearlin ' calf in . " You know if Bird-Neck killed hisself , " says Lew Kendall , " he could n't bury hisself . That 's a cinch . " " Do n't reckon he hung hisself , " says Mort Kenyon . So he looked up in the green-leafed tree . " I do n't see ' im up there . Tree is a shell-barked hickory and big and hard to climb fer a man eighty years old , nohow . " " We ai n't hunted through his house and barn , " says Bud Travis . " We ai n't hunted over the pastures and the timberlandsyet . " It took us all week to search the woods . We went throughp183the pasture fields . We searched the tall-timbered lands . We went over every foot of Bird-Neck 's farm . We looked among the tall weeds around the house and barn . We bailed the water out'n the well . Bird-Neck war n't in the bottom o ' the well . We could n't find ' im no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travis . " He ai n't here no place . " " I ' spect he 's went up in Ohio , " says Flem Sowards , " to see the children by his first wife . Maybe he went to Oklahoma to see the young'uns by his second wife , er young Bird-Neck by Melvin Sprouse 's old maid gal , Martha ! " " He ai n't gone that fur , " I says , " fer he 's told me more'n once he ai n't never been a hundred miles from home . You know he would n't go off and leave a pot o ' corn-pone bread fer old Shep in the middle o ' the floor . I know Bird-Neck is a dead man . " The summer passed and we 'd never heard no more o ' BirdNeck . No one had seen ' im . My wife Effie wrote to Aaron , Bird-Neck 's oldest boy by Widder Jenny , to see if he 'd gone to Oklahoma . He had n't come there . She wrote a letter up in Ohio to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he wrote a letter back sayin ' he had n't come there . It was in October ; I started shuckin ' Bird-Neck 's corn . I took Moll off'n the pasture to my barn and was keepin ' ' er . No one to take Bird-Neck 's corn . His young'uns was too fur away . They 'd never come home when they 'd heard their pap was missin ' . I 'd keep Moll and Shep until they died . I 'd take Bird-Neck 's wheat and corn . The great sweeps o ' fall-time winds would whip like a buggy-whop through the trees . Then the leaves would fall in swarms , jist like birds gettin ' ready fer th ' South . The treetops got bare . I was shuckin ' corn in the last shock row . I was shuckin ' the last shock under the tall shell-barked hickory tree . I heard a rattlin ' in th ' wind above me . I jist looked up in the tall treep184where the wind had whopped away the leaves . Lord , I thought I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-jinglin ' like a cowbell up there in the top o ' the tree . I did n't think a man eighty years old would ever climb a tree like that . Must a been sixty feet up to where Bird-Neck was hangin ' . A plowlinewas holdin ' ' im up there . I looked at the body o ' the tree and there was a row o ' black ants and a row o ' red ants a-goin ' separate paths up the tree . I jist supposed they 'd been goin ' to Bird-Neck 's bones . It was late fer ants , too . But it was a warm sunny day . It all come back to me . " He 'll never get me . The birds o ' th ' air and th ' ants on the ground 'll get me . " They had got Bird-Neck , too , jist like he 'd planned . The wind had swept his bones and bleached ' em . " Maybe it 's been his laugh , " I thought , " that I 've been hearin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn . It could a been Bird-Neck all right watchin ' me work . Jist ramblin ' over his old farm . " Well , it is all over , " I says . " I 'll call the boys . We'Il see if one o ' us can climb that tree . We 'll haf to cut ' im down . " I brought the boys to the tree that had helped me hunt the place over fer Bird-Neck . Not one o ' us could climb it . " I know what we can do , " says Bud Travis . " We can get a rifle and shoot the rope in two . That will be a lot easier . I do n't see how a man eighty years old climbed that tree nohow . " Bud went to the house and brought back the rifle . He shot twice at the rope and the white bones tumbled from the tree . His bones were clean and white . The weather had made ' em that way atter they 'd been picked by the crows and buzzards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's oaks . We jist put the bones in it without anything around ' em . We hauled it on a sled from the spot with old Moll . We took ' im back out on th ' p'int . We buried him beside his three wives in th ' land he loved.  |p185From  early spring to late autumn , Pa carried salt to the hundred cattle in the big pasture . He 'd carry seventyfivepounds at a load up the steep mountain to the long salt trough he 'd made of hollow logs . He had cut down hollow trees and split them with wedges , trimmed each split log neatly with a double-bitted ax , and fastened them together . It was a long trough resting on foundation rocks so the cattle could stand side by side and lick salt . This salting trough was the place where the cattle met in the big pasture field . It was where they got acquainted . In early spring when Pa put strange cattle in the pasture he 'd call to them to come and get salt . At first they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cattle did , and went running for salt when they heard his voice . The other cattle soon learned to follow. .185p186At this meeting place Pa would count everybody 's cattle that he was pasturing , to see if they were in the pasture . If one was missing , he would n't stop till he found it . Pa soon learned every calf , cow , heifer , and steer in the pasture . All he had to do was look one over carefully and he never forgot it . He knew each of the hundred cattle in the big pasture where thirty belonged to us and seventy belonged to nine different people . He knew and could have called by name , if the cattle had been named , the hundred eighty-seven head of cattle he had in the other six pastures on our seven-hundred-eight-acre hill farm . But when Pa called for the cattle to come to their salt in the big pasture , all would come but one . That was Jack Remines ' heifer with the dots above her eyes . She would followthe other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come all the way . She 'd come to within a couple of hundred yards . Then there she would stand and watch the other cattle lick salt . She 'd watch them with her head held high , her neck held stiff as a board , and her black eyes beaming in deep sockets as she looked at Pa . She would never come near him . " That Remines heifer is a quare animal , " Pa once said to me . " Cattle have always liked me . But not that one . She 's the wildest thing I 've ever seen . I 've been a-tryin ' to tame her since the day Jake fetched her here . But seems like she gets wilder all the time . Last April she did n't stand more than a hundred yards from the salt trough . Here it is August again and she stands two hundred yards away . Must be the foxhoundsa-runnin ' through here have made her nature wilder . But I will tame ' er and have her a-lickin ' salt from my hands before Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . But in September the heiferwould not come within three hundred yards of the salt trough . " I ca n't understand it , " Pa said . " That heifer must bea-goin ' wild . Out here where she never sees anybody but mep187and the fox hunters . Out here where she hears fox horns a-blowin ' and hound-dogs a-barkin ' and wind in the trees ! I reckon that 's enough to make a brute go wild ! " Among all the cattle Pa was pasturing for other people , cattle that would come and lick salt from his hand , Pa directedall his attention toward the heifer . " I 'll tame her yet , " he said . " I 'll have her so tame that all Jake 'll have to do when he comes to take his cattle home is to walk up to her and put his hand on her neck and lead her across the pasture . I 've never seen one yet I could n't tame . Something about me animals like . It hurts my feelings when a brute turns against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns on me . I ca n't let Jake 's heifer leave this pasture without lickin ' salt from my hand . " All through August and September Pa worked with Jake 's heifer trying to tame her . When Pa would walk toward her , she 'd bristle up like a doubtful dog and sniff the wind . When he 'd get within a hundred yards she 'd take off , jumping like a deer , with her long tail floating on the wind . Pa and I agreed we 'd never seen a heifer that could run like that one . She 'd leap over stumps , rocks , brier patches and go to the tall timber where she 'd disappear among the trees . We 'd not see her until we went to salt the cattle again . On the last day of October when Jake came to get his cattle , Pa told him about the heifer . Pa told Jake he 'd not been able to get any closer than a hundred yards to her . " She always had a wild nature , " Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his face . " But my heifer 's not got a nature as wild as you say . " Jake paid Pa seventy dollars for pasturing his ten head of cattle for seven months . Jake bragged to Pa about how his cattle had grown . He said they 'd put on about three hundred pounds of weight to the animal  --  all except the heifer . The heifer was standing so far away Jake could n't see her too well.  |p188But  the other nine head of Jake 's cattle stood close around us at the salt trough . " Well , let 's get her with the rest of my cattle , " Jake said . " I 'll fetch her , " Pa volunteered . Pa wanted to show Jake what a man he was for his years . He wanted to show Jake how a lean , bony little man sixtysevenyears old could run . Jake was n't as old as Pa and the hair on his head was white as milkweed fuzz that the wind lifts from the pods and blows away in August . Pa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ground . When Pa took off running to get on the far side of the heifer and drive her back toward us , he sailed over old stumps , rock piles , and brier patches like a scared fox . " Look at that , wo n't you ! " Jake said as he watched Pa run . " Your father is a young man for his years . He 's younger than you are . I 'm an old man beside him . " But when the heifer saw Pa was trying to hem her up , she showed Pa how to run . She wheeled around on her hind feet in one whirl , and it looked to us like her feet were not touching the ground . Looked to us like she was stepping on the wind . Her legs moved like well-oiled pistons and her tail was riding on the October mountain wind like a kite . She was running toward the tall timber . The heifer outran Pa as easily as a fox outruns a slow hound , while we stood at the salt trough looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he put on brakes and skated like a young skater for a few feet on the damp dying October grass . There Pa stood and watched her disappear under the tall timber . I wanted to laugh , but I did n't . I knew who 'd be running after her before we caught her for Jake Remines . Pa turned around and walked slowly and sadly back to us . " You 've done your best , " Jake told Pa . " Honest , you can run like a greyhound . You stay in shape climbin ' these moun/tains and carryin ' salt to cattle . You can run like a hound-dog yourself , but that heifer runs like a deer . " " Never saw anything like it , " Pa said . " I can catch most any of ' em but her . Ca n't understand what has made her so wild . " " Never worry about it , " Jake said . " I 'll take these through the gate and drive ' em home . I 'll be back tomorrow and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And I 'll come and bring Shan and Finn , " Pa told him . " We 'll catch ' er , all right . " " Say , come to think of it , Mick , " Jake said , pressing the white beard on his face again , " what will you give me for that heifer ? I know you deal in cattle , and I do , too . Why not a little trade ? " " What 'll you take for ' er ? " Pa said in half words , for he was getting his breath hard . Pa 's face changed . He smiled . " She 's a nice heifer , Mick , " Jake said . " She 's young and full of life . " " She 's sure full of life , all right , " Pa admitted . " I think she 's worth sixty dollars , Mick , " Jake said , rubbing his cheek with his big hand . " Too much , too much , Jake , " Pa snapped . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , I 'm pricing ' er fifteen dollars cheaper to you than I would anybody else , Mick . " Jake looked at the ground and kicked at the brown grass with the toe of his brogan shoe . " She 's really worth seventy-five , the way cattle are selling at the market . Little hard to catch  --  that 's the reason I priced ' er to you so cheap . " " That 's too high , Jake . " Pa turned to walk away . " Not a cent cheaper , " Jake said as he turned his cattlethrough the gate . " I 'll be back to take her away tomorrow . " " We 'll be here to help you , " Pa said . Pa turned to watchp190Jake walk away behind his nine head of cattle . One of Jake 's big steers turned his head and bawled to Pa as he went through the gate . All of them would lick salt from his hand . As Pa and I walked along the path home , Pa walked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild laugh . That was the way he had done ever since I could remember , when he was thinking about a trade . The very next day , Pa , Finn , and I met Jake and his sons , Dave and Bob , at the salt trough . All the cattle had been moved from the big pasture but Jake 's heifer . We thought she 'd be close to the salting place , but she was n't . " Heard her bawlin ' out in the tall timber , " Jake said . " Out yander on that point . " " She 's lonesome for the other cattle , " Pa said . " Let 's be after her . " Dave Remines was a long-legged young man about my age . Bob Remines was short and heavy . He was a thick young man with big arms and powerful legs . Brother Finn was six feet four and had always been a great runner . " We 'll get ' er now , " Pa said . " My son Shan used to be on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances in college . Finn 's a good runner , too . And I 'm not so bad myself for a man my age . " " No , you 're not , Mick , " Jake bragged on Pa . " And I 've got a couple of good runners here , too . Fox-hunt every other night and climb these mountains . They 'll be hard men to beat on a chase . I 'm not a-sayin ' this because they 're my boys , either . Guess I 'll be the slowest man among you . " Finn and I looked Bob and Dave over . I knew the thought that raced through my brother Finn 's mind . He was goin ' to try to show Bob and Dave Remines up on the chase after the heifer . We did n't have long to wait for the chase . We had justp191walked into the tall timber on the Hilton Point when Dave Remines spotted the heifer and we gave chase . And that is a chase we will long remember . Pa started out leaping over logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother Bob was at his heels . Finn was third and I was fourth . Jake Remines trotted after me . Pa tried to skirt around all of us as the heifer took off like a young deer . She ran so fast we soon lost sight of her . We listened the way she went through the dry autumn leaves as long as we could and then we followed the way of the sound . And when we came to the place where we last heard the sound , all of us getting our breath hard , we picked up her tracks and took off again like a pack of hounds . When we reached Coon Den Hollow , Pa and Jake were out of the chase . When we followed her tracks up the old log road to Seaton Ridge , Bob Remines fell down , holding his side with his hands . " Ca n't go any farther , boys , " he managed to grunt . His brother Dave , who was now following my brother Finn , did n't say a word . He did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was following . We had Dave between us . " You boys are ridge-runners , " he grunted in little half breaths as we topped Seaton Ridge . In the distance we saw the heifer running with all the ease in the world . She was n't tired . Then across the open field where the land sloped gently , Finn set a terrific pace with his long legs pulling against the wind . Then I got closer on Dave 's heels . I finally passed Dave , and he was the third man . Dave did n't have much steam , either  --  not enough for another three-mile circuit like the heifer had just taken us . Before we reached Hilton Point and the tall timber we met Pa and Jake coming on back.  | " She 's too much for us , " Pa grunted . " We saw ' er , but we did n't give chase . She went over toward Howard Hollow . " Finn went in that direction and I followed . We never saw Dave again  --  not on that chase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found the track again . We followed her tracks up the hill and over into Shingle Mill Hollow toward Coon Den Hollow again . I followed Finn into Coon Den Hollow . " Why run a heifer like this and kill ourselves ? " Finn asked , stopping suddenly . " We could run her all day and not catch her . Run her till we have a heart attack . Run her for what ? What 's this heifer to us ? " " Not anything , " I agreed as the dry spittle flew from my hot mouth . My tongue was dry . I was hot . I hardly had enough breath to answer Finn . " Let 's let ' er go . " Then Finn and I walked up the log road to Seaton Ridge . When we got back to the salt trough Dave and Bob Remines were stretched on the grass resting . Pa and Jake were sitting on big stumps . " Could n't you get ' er ? " Jake asked us . " We ca n't do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take off like that one . " " See , I told you , Jake , " Pa said . " Yesterday I would have give you fifty for her . Today I wo n't . I would n't give you but forty . " " Oh , that 's not enough , Mick , " Jake snapped . " I 've just been out seven dollars to you for pasturing her this summer . Could n't do that . We 'll come horseback tomorrow and bring my shepherd dog . You come and bring your shepherd . " " We 'll be here , " Pa said . " We 'll ride mules . They 'll be better for goin ' under the brush . " So the next day we met again . Bob , Dave , and Jake Remines were in good saddles on three nice-looking saddle horses . Theyp193had brought their shepherd dog , Jolly . Pa was in the only saddle we had , astride our Rock mule . Finn was riding Dinah and I was riding Dick . We did n't have saddles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were off , all of us riding toward Hilton Point . In the open space in a little hollow , and near the tall timber on Hilton Point , Pa saw the heifer . " Yander she is , boys , " he shouted . He pointed in the direction . We were off like a small cavalry , over the rocks , stumps , clusters of briers , and brush . The two dogs knew what we were after and they ran ahead of us . The heifer stood , sniffed the wind , and when Remines ' shepherd , Jolly , ran up , she lunged through the air at him . All her feet were in the air when she pinned him against the ground and gored him with her sharp straight horns . Our shepherd , Bob , went the other way , with his tail between his legs . " She 's killed Jolly , " Jake Remines shouted . He was weepingwhen he stopped his horse and climbed from the saddle . He raced toward old Jolly who was lying there kicking and howling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got down to look at Jolly while the heifer took her time trotting along toward the tall timber . Jake felt of all the bones first in old Jolly to see if the heifer had crushed any . Then he examined the place where her horns had punctured his tough hide . The spot was bleeding , but not badly . " He 'll be all right , " Jake said . " She just took the wind out of ' im and skeered ' im half to death . He 's never been after an animal like that one . " " The only way we 'll ever take that heifer from this pasture is to take her dead , " Bob Remines said . " If I had a gun I 'd shoot ' er ! " " Oh , no , never do that , " Pa said . " She 's not fat enough for beef . You 'd lose a good animal . " " Come on , men , " Finn said , " let 's be after her . "  |p194Old  Jolly was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow . Old Bob had taken off toward home , after he had seen what the heifer had done to Jolly . Jake , Bob , and Dave Remines and Pa climbed back into their saddles . Finn and I leaped onto our barebacked mules . We followed the horses that took the lead . A wild grapevine caught Jake under the chin and lifted him from his saddle onto a bed of dry leaves . The branch of a tree that Dave let fly behind him slapped Pa across the face and eyes . We left Pa and Jake , scared but unhurt , and rode after the heifer . I thought somewhereahead , I did n't know where , if a heifer could laugh , this heifer was laughing at us . We could n't ride under the trees and through the brush and briers and undergrowth as fast as we could walk . Then a poplar limb with bark almost the color of the wind pulled Bob Remines from his saddle and his elbow hit a rock . " No more of this for me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " We left Bob walking and leading his horse from the thicket . We went on until Dinah fell with Finn when she tried to leap the creek . Finn jumped to the ground and was safe . Dick was sure-footed and I stuck to his back . Dave Remines ' horse slipped on a steep slope and pressed Dave against a tree . It took the breath from him just a minute . This was enough . We turned back while the heifer ran fleet-footed with the wind , over the dying grass and autumn leaves . She ran somewhere , we did n't know where . We managed to come back to the big grassfield in Shingle Mill Hollow and we mounted and rode toward the salt trough . We overtook Bob Remines on the way ; he was still leading his horse . " Think my elbow must be cracked , " he said . He had only a few more yards to walk to where Pa and Jake were sitting on their favorite stumps near the salt trough.  |p195Each  of them was holding the bridle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday I would have given you forty , Jake , " Pa said . " But not today . Not after I saw what that heifer did to old Jolly . I believe she 's dangerous . I would n't give you a cent over thirty . " " Oh , I could n't take that , " Jake said . " Take it , Pap , " Bob Remines said , as he walked up leading his horse . " I 've got a cracked elbow over this heifer . " " Take it , Pap , " Dave Remines said . " I nearly got a panel of ribs busted when my horse slipped down against the side of a tree . Got the breath knocked out of me . Yesterday I ran after her until my heart nearly stopped . Take thirty bucks and let 's get goin ' . " " Boys , look what I 've got in that red-blooded heifer , " Jake said . " I ca n't take that . I 'll take thirty-seven . That 's just thirty dollars and the pasture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , Mick ? " " Too much , " Pa smiled as if he were in a position to set his own price . " I 'll give you thirty . " " All right , " Jake sighed at last . " It 's a bad deal , Pa , " Finn said . " You 'll be sorry you ever bought that heifer . " Bob and Dave Remines were pleased . Jake seemed pleased to be rid of the heifer . Pa paid him in cash right on the spot when he agreed to thirty . Pa smiled as I never saw him smile before . I wondered what he was thinking . Then Jake and Dave mounted their horses . Finn and I helped Bob into the saddle . They rode away with Jolly limpingalong behind them . Then Pa climbed into the saddle and Finn and I leapedp196astride Dick and Dinah and we followed Pa toward home . Pa sat in the saddle laughing . " What 's so funny ? " Finn asked . " Tell us and we 'll laugh , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred dollars for thirty , " Pa said . " Old Jake has always beat me on trading . Once he sold me a mule with the distemper for seventy-five . Mule was n't worth ten to me . I 've made it back in this trade . " " I would n't give you thirty for that heifer , " Finn said . " He cheated you again . That heifer just never can be tamed . " " She 'll be easy to tame , " Pa said . " I wonder that Jake did n't think about it . Cattle often go wild . But there 's a way to tame ' em . " " How , Pa ? " I asked . " Just leave ' em alone , " Pa said . " Leave that heifer alone in this pasture until the first snow falls . She 'll get hungry . And when she gets hungry , she 'll be tame . She 'll be lickin ' salt out of my hand before December . " Pa laughed as we rode toward home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . "  |p197Steave  Sloan , our county sheriff , came up to me last Sunday and says , " I got a summons for you , Jasper l liggins , to be before the grand jury Monday morning at ten o'clock . " I turned and looked at old Steave , the scarred relic of many a bout with lawbreakers , whisky , and women . His face was red from overdrinking , and his belly shook under his blue shirt and brown suspenders like a bag of sand . His blue eyes ( lodged my gaze and glanced toward the ragweeds by the path when he read my summons . " What am I summoned before the grand jury for ? I ca n't indict anybody . Who 's had me summoned before the grand jury , anyway ? " I says to the sheriff . " Did n't my people supportyou in the election ?  --  and then you take me before the grand jury . " " I do n't know who summoned you , Jasper , " says Sloan. 197 " I 'm doing my duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . This is part of the duty of the sheriff . I have to do this . Do n't think hard of me . " Old Steave was still glancing down at the dirt . I did n't have the right to rub it in . Maybe if Steave would get shot in a gun fight , then I 'd be sorry for a long time afterwards for what I had said to him . I began to draw in my horns and planned to do no more hooking . " If you do n't come to the grand jury , they can fine you , " says Steave , " and have you arrested and brought before the grand jury . I 'd advise you to come Monday morning and do your little do and get it all over with , Jasper . " " Why ca n't you tear up the summons and be a sport ? " " I ca n't do that . You know the trouble I got into once over that Pratt boy , and God in Heaven knows I did n't tear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on me in the last election and come nigh as a pea sending me up for a couple ' f years . I ai n't taking no more chances . " " It 's all right , Steave . You 'll run again . " Sheriff of the grand jury Benjamin Harrison William McKinkyRister met me at the door . He too was red-faced from overdrinking and his lips stood blubberly and far apart . His teeth were snaggly and set wide apart . He reached his hand out to clasp mine and says , " You 're Jasper Higgins , ai n't you ? " " That 's what they call me , Sheriff Rister , " I said . " We 'll put you right here in the bull pen in just a few minutes . You just wait around here . Do n't leave this door . Stay right here where I can call you at any minute . " I saw Fannie Brooker come out of the bull pen and she was crying , " My God , I had to indict my own poor old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent to kill . My God , my God . "  |p199Then  Percy Ratliff went in when Sheriff Rister called him . He went in with a big grin showing his tobacco-stained teeth . Percy was in the bull pen about five minutes . Sheriff Rister brought him to the door and turned him out . " Boys , " says Percy , " they got our numbers and all our deeds . They know what we know and more , too . They got me . I was in that Cane Creek fracas when Hiram Williams got plugged and I had to indict a whole smear . I hated to do it but I had to . I indicted old Granny Stamper and Tim Rigsby and a whole slew of Cane Creek people . No way around it . I 'd like to know who in the hell was nosy enough to turn my name in to the grand jury  --  damned low-down skunks ! " " Jasper Higgins , next ! " " All right , Sheriff . " Well , there was Fence Porter . He was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreman of the grand jury . I 'd seen Fence before . We 'd met on several occasions in different crowds at different places . We just happened to run into each other , not knowing that the other fellow was going to be there . A right pretty woman was writing down every word I said from the time I entered the room and said " Howdy " to the men  --  twelve of them , all lined up around the wall , each with a separate spittoon . There was old Sneeze Radform , Tim Mullikin , Henry Divers , John Isom , Foxey Hunter , Jack Cristwellwith his snow-white head of bushy hair , Felix Middletown , Jason Purcell , Wildcat Robinson , Teddy Newsome , Tiger Hatfield , and Hungry Wakefield . " Well , what do you know for the good of the country , Jasper ? " says Tiger Hatfield , spitting at the amber-colored can and missing it a good foot measured with a rule . " Know anything that ai n't right that 's goin ' on around your farm out there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Tiger . He surely had n't forgot that I had the deadwood on him . He did n't have any right to ask me anything . Maybe he did it to show the other grand jurymen that his heart was on the right side and that he was earning his two dollars a day . He just could n't go too far if indictments could date back three years . I thought he 'd at least not ask me about a few things . The boys all looked me over and I looked at them . Jason Purcell said , " Did you hit Lefty Smith 's boy Turkey and knock him over that shrubbery back of the schoolhouse last February ? " " A man do n't have to indict himself , " I says . Pa had instructed me about this if they ever had me up before the grand jury . I was summoned on Sunday and that was n't legal either . " I heard it was you who hit Turkey Smith out back of the schoolhouse that night and that he had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me he thought his neck was cracked . " I never said a word . There was n't anything left to say . The woman wrote down what they said . She wrote down all that I had said . She just sat there and wrote and wrote and looked over at the chair where I was sitting . Pa always told me to take my part , and when a man come at me using foul methods , for me to chill him with anything I got my hands on . " Have you seen anybody with a deadly concealed weapon on their parts , " says Felix Middletown , " sich as a pistol , a pair o ' knucks , a hawk-bill knife with a blade five inches long , or a blackjack ? " " Yes , sir . " " What did he have concealed on his parts ? " " He had five-and-a-half-inch washers with a wire run through ' em . He had a blackjack. "  | " Who was he ? " " I did n't know him . He was a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em ? Was he using ' em ? " " No . It was last horse-trade day and he traded them to bootin a horse swap down on the jockey grounds by the feed mill . " " Has anybody give you pizened licker ? " says Foxey Hunter . " Yes , sir . " " Who was he ? " " I wish I knew . " I was n't lying . I could n't lie . The foreman told me to hold up my hand when I first come in the room with the grand jury sheriff , and he swore me to tell the truth and nothing but the truth , so help me God . I had to tell the truth . They seemed to expect me to say something else , though , so I says , " Boys , I 've drunk enough to know good licker . I 've tried all kinds and no man had better not try to get any rotten stuff off on me with carbide or coppers in it . I 'd go before a grand jury and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff when I drink . I 've sampled all kinds of licker  --  I 've drunk enough to float a saw log to the mouth of Big Sandy River . " " Have you heard any vile words used in public in the presence of ladies ? " says Wildcat Robinson . " Yes , sir . " " Who done that ? " says Wildcat . " And what did they say ? " " When I come down the street a little while ago , a fellow said sonofa  --  ' and a woman was passing right along beside of him . She heard what he said . " " Who was the woman ? " says Wildcat . " Who was the man ? " says Foxey Hunter . " Did n't know neither one of them  --  man nor woman . " " What kind of a looking man was he , Jasper ? " " He was big-bellied with a long sandy beard , had blue eyes with heavy brown eyebrows , white teeth , and a snarl on his Ups . He 'd weigh about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's old Fred Sizemore I 'll bet you a twist of shoe peg it was old Fred , " says Tim Mullikin . " He lives up on Slash Branch and he comes to town every Saturday of the world and gets drunk as a badger and gets locked up . He gets out on Monday morning , cussing and whooping and wanting to fight because he got locked up . He 's just got to have his spree every weekend . The other day I saw him all dressed up and started to town and I said to him , Where are you going , Fred ? ' Going to town to get drunk , and Lord God , how I do dread it ! ' " The grand jurymen all laughed . Tiger showed his tobaccostainedteeth that looked like new-ground stumps set in a lobber-sided horseshoe curve . " Ca n't do anything about it , boys , if we do n't know his name , " says Felix Middletown . " Just have to pass it up . Let 's proceed to ask young Jasper about Lake Madden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the place . Now is the time to find out . " " Do you know Lake Madden ? " " Yes . " " Did you ever go there ? " " Once . " " Did you go to see a woman or buy licker or go for both ? " " Neither . " " What did you go for ? " " To get some phonograph records , That 's My Baby ' and St. Louis Blues . ' " " Did you see Babe Madden ? " " Yes . " " Did you buy any licker from her ? " " No . " " Did she try to sell you any licker ? " " No . " " Law 's been tryin ' to get that woman for the past tenp203years , " says Foxey Hunter , " and they ca n't get a thing on her . We know she sells that old rot-gut whisky . Did n't Sheriff Barney go over there when he was in the sheriff 's office  --  that 's been seven years ago  --  and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There was a couple of revenue men with the sheriff . They hunted and hunted and could n't find a thing . Then they started diggin ' in the yard and Babe started screamin ' and sayin ' not to dig under the peach tree . The boys thought they was right on her licker , but dog my cats ! If she did n't run around t' other side of the buildin ' and dig up a five-gallon glass jug o ' licker and smash it with a double-bitted ax , I 'm a liar . It soaked up in the loose dirt . Boys knowed it was licker but they could n't swear it by smellin ' of the glass and the ground . That ai n't sufficient evidencein court . She 's a bad one . Looks funny , young Jasper goin ' over there to get music when he can get a lot more there than music . " " Here 's somethin ' I want to ask Jasper Higgins , " says John Isom . " Did you have a fight one night at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist and knock him cold as a beef ? " " I did . " " What did you hit him with  --  a pair of knucks ? " " No , sir . I hit him with my hand . See this knuckle knocked back here ! Knucks wo n't let you break your knuckles . " " That 's right , Jasper , but why did you hit him ? " " He tore up a school program . Come in with a cowboy hat on his head and whooped out that he was the meanest man since Adam . Rest of ' em set around there afraid to move , schoolteachers and all . Was n't no Law at that schoolhouse . Never is any Law down there . So I thought I 'd see if he was the meanest man since Adam . " " Where did you hit him ? " " On the chin . "  | " How long was he cold as a beef ? " " Till they went and got the sheriff . Had to go a mile and get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . Where there 's not any Law to protect a man , there should n't be any to prosecute him . We have to protect ourselvesin this county . You know that . Shoot a man down , you get one year in the pen . Steal a chicken , you get five years in the pen . No pardon on chicken-stealin ' , but you do have a chance for a pardon if you belong to the right party when you kill a man . They need your family vote . The family turns against them unless the killer gets a pardon . Sometimes it 's already waitin ' in the courtroom soon as the man is sentenced . I 've resolved to protect myself first , then my friends second . " " He 's right , boys , " says Wildcat Robinson . " The boy needs a medal . He ought to be rewarded . " " He ought to be made a Kentucky Colonel , " said Felix Middletown . " He ai n't on the right side of the fence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside folks , you know , " says Foxey Hunter . " Man had better never start any of that old Adam stuff with me . That 's old as the hills . I 'd pick up a rock and cave his damn skull in , " says Felix Middletown . " I 've seen too much of it around here . I heerd that fight kinda settled ' em down at that schoolhouse . Ai n't been near so many fights since . People can go there in a little peace now . Twelve men was into that scrap , I heerd . " " What about this Susie Lawthorne that you 've been rennin ' around here with , the last two months ? " says County Attorney Gilmore Hix . " Is she a pretty nice girl ? " " Far as I know she is all right . It all depends on what you call a nice girl . " " I mean the way she conducts herself in public places . " " Have you ever been any place with her away from herp205home ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Yes , I have . " " Where have you been ? " asks Hungry Wakefield . " I 've been to church and to the square dances several times . " " That 's all we wanted to know , " says Tiger . " We just want to get the straight of these things we 've been hearin ' . We want to clean up a lot of this corruption from our land and make our county a decent place for a man to bring his girls up in . I got a couple of little girls down there and I 'll tell you it 's goin ' to be hard to bring ' em up in a community where all this blackguardin ' and totin ' pistols , drinkin ' booze , and stealin 's goin ' on . We ai n't here to harm nobody . We are here to get this county cleaned up . We aim to do our best . " " I second the motion , Tiger , " says Hungry . " You and me ai n't stood together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm standin ' right by you when you are tryin ' to do the right thing . " " About all we want with him , ai n't it , Foreman ? " says Wildcat Robinson . " All them fellows out there a-waitin ' . He do n't know enough , nohow . " " Dismissed , " says Foreman Porter . " Take him out , Sheriff Rister . " I got down off the bench and walked across the room . I did n't go out cussing or crying . I just wondered how many poor devils I had indicted . I hoped I had n't indicted any . I remember at one grand jury the county got enough indictmentsto fill the docket with better than six hundred cases . The district judge could n't have got through with them all in his whole term of office . They were all for little petty things , too  --  like carrying a pistol , using profanity in front of ladies , or fighting . Sometimes the ways of the Law do n't seem right sensible.  |p206Now  , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Op told me . " Of course he 's like myself when it comes to looks . He 's not much to look at . But I 'm just telling you , if you need a man to help me on the pasture , I 'll recommend Young Charlie to you . " There was a twinkle in Old Op 's eye the cataract had n't completely covered . There was mischievousness in his other , almost sightless , eye that stared at me from the deep socket . Long wiry sand-brier-colored beard stood upon his wrinkled face like dwarfed bushes on the wrinkled slope of a rugged hill . " What are you up to , Op ? " I said . " Well , Young Charlie works around for everybody for almostnothing . " He spoke sympathetically , his better eye twinkling with mischief . " I think he 's been working for Bill Rouse down on Sandy River for three dollars for twelve hours. 206p207He works from sunrise to sunset , by jimmy ! Just like the oldtimersused to work . And I said the other day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hear you 're Morgan County 's champion sprout-cutter . But I hear Bill Rouse ai n't paying you much . How 'd you like to help me cut sprouts ? Six bucks a day instead of three . Work an eighthourday with me . No one around but you and me . Nobody there to look down your collar . Just you and me in good cuttin ' on a clean hill . ' Well , you ought to a seen Young Charlie'seyes pop out . Boy , I 'd like it , ' he said . Then I told him I 'd come and see you ! " " That 's not the reason you want Young Charlie , " I said . " You 've got some other reason . " " Nope , " he said . He could n't hold his lips in place . They bent like rainbows when he exploded with a cackling laughter akin to a hen pheasant 's cackling . " Nope , I 'm not up to nothin ' . I 've heard Young Charlie has bragged around that nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Morgan County 's champion do n't mean he 's a champion in my county . " " How old a man is Charlie Cotton , Op ? " I asked . " He 's only fifty-six . " I 'd seen Charlie Cotton , about the size of Op , snake-hipped , beardy-faced , walking along the road with a tall slender woman . They went from place to place , sleeping in summer in barns beside the road or in homes where people would let them stay . He had worked for small wages because he was such a homely man people were afraid of him . He worked in the fields when and wherever he could find anyone who would hire him . She worked in homes , washing clothes and scrubbing floors , if she was lucky enough to get work in the home while Charlie worked on the farm . When he squirrel-hunted , she took a gun and hunted with him . When he fished in the Sandy River , she fished with him.  |p208When  he got his small pay on a Saturday and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd take half of their money and buy chewing gum , candy , ice cream , and sodas . Then he might buy illegal wine or whisky from one of the many bootleggers in this dry territory . They 'd get imbibed , start home , and not get there . They 'd sleep somewhere beside the road . I 'd never planned to hire Charlie Cotton to work for me . I knew people he 'd worked for would n't have him and his common-law wife staying in their homes unless they were people who were immune to odors . Young Charlie had a beardy face with squinty blue eyes , deep-set above high cheek bones . He had a long straight body minus hips where his legs , swinging like pendulums , hooked onto his torso . His body was longer than his legs . His arms were long , too , for a man his size . His hands were like small shovels . He worked in tight-fitting overalls , a faded blue work shirt , and a pin-striped cap with a long bill . Two teeth were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his upper front teeth were broken . They looked like short charcoal-black stumps where a row of trees had been cut years ago . Every other lower tooth was dark . One could n't help but notice Young Charlie 's teeth the minute he opened his mouth . Once I met him and his wife walking on the Womack Hollow road . I never forgot this strange couple . I certainly never forgot his teeth . I knew Old Op did n't care for Charlie Cotton . He did n't care for any man he 'd ever worked with in the fields . In the last twenty years I had never been able to get a man who could work with gentle old tall-tale-telling Op . He 'd tell his tall tales to entertain the man who worked with him . At sunset Old Op would tell him he had n't done anything and that he ought to be fired . And if I did n't fire him , Old Op would refuse to work with such a slowpoke another day . This was the way Old Op had treated them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Op . Uncle Jake was a **30;11012;TOOLONG and a neat worker . But Old Op told everybody he had to do all the work while my uncle slept in the shade . Uncle Jake could have worked on for me , but he would n't work at the same job with Old Op . Then I sent Happy Gore out with Old Op once to cut saw timber . Old Op told Happy Gore some new tales until he shook all over . Happy got down on his knees , for he was so tickled he could n't stand up , to cut the tall saw briers from around a pine tree with his pocketknife . He did n't know while he was down on his knees shaking all over with laughter , slashing greenbriers with his knife , that he was entertaining Old Op . When Old Op got through talking about Happy Gore , everybody was laughing . When people met Happy on the streets they stood back and laughed . Happy Gore did n't know what the joke was or who had started it . But Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees with a pocketknife to trim the briers from around a pine before they knelt down with their crosscut saw . " And we cut only four little saw logs in a half day , " Old Op told his listeners . " That 's the slowest man I ever saw in my life . Gets down and sights over the crosscut like it was a rifle barrel . I told Shan Powderjay I would n't work for no man , look him in the eyes , and take pay for cutting four little logs size of my thigh in a half day . No , siree , I would n't do it ! " I had to let Happy Gore work with Uncle Jake because Old Op told so many tales about them that everybody was laughing . They were laughing at my uncle , who got imbibed over each weekend and lay somewhere in the woods . One of the stories Old Op told about him was that he once got drunk and lay in a four-foot drift of snow . He was so hot he melted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran from Uncle Jake . Old Op had told all these tales on men I had hired to work with him . He had even told tales on me . He 'd told that thep210day we cut eighty-two saw logs in a half day , he had to notch all the trees because I did n't know how to notch a tree . And when we put the tiles under the road we built to the Seaton Ridge , he had had to carry the sections of **32;11044;TOOLONG tiles by himself while I sprawled under the oak shade . People started laughing at me . When they did , I said , " Old Op 's told you something . Did he ever tell you about the snake he hit between the eyes with a fence rail which was so big that it tore down a two-acre field of wheat after he addled it ? " " Op , you plan to do something to Young Charlie , " I said . " But if he wants to work with you , I 'll hire him . " Wo n't they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I want the two in my pasture field cutting sprouts together . I hired Charlie Cotton . Old Op took the new red-handled mattock to the field . He took the bush blades , sprouting hoes , axes , new files , and scythe rocks . Old Op took his own jug of water . Old Op and I always drank from the same jug . Charlie Cotton might have felt the same way about Old Op for he fetched his own jug of water . I went to the field and showed them what I wanted cut . " Now , you take this side , Young Charlie , " Old Op said . " I 'll take this one . We work apart so at sundown you can count your many blessings and I can count mine . We 'll see which of us is the champion . " I knew what Old Op was up to . He had tried to do the same thing to me . Anybody who worked with him he acceptedas his rival . Old Op was a good competitor . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the job he loved to do . He could swing an ax so softly ; yet it sank to the eye each lick he struck . When he used a hoe , you would n't think he was doing much . But Op always had little schemes he employed to put himself ahead of the others . He used his head as well as his ax.  |p211If  he ran into grapevines wrapped around many trees , he started cutting at the outer edge of the grapevine perimeter , going in toward the center from all parts of the circle . Finally , they fell in a big heap . Old Op not only had them down but neatly piled . While we , who used our axes more and heads less , went inside the grapevine thicket , cut from the center , and pulled and chopped until we finally got them cut and piled . Old Op would n't work with anybody close to him . The first week , Old Op and Young Charlie cut everything in one little valley . Then they started working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our house for more water , I said , " How are you and Old Op getting along ? " " That old man 's the awfulest brush cutter I purt nigh ever seed , " Young Charlie said . " He 's about got me down . I 've had to work to stay with ' im . I like to work close enough to hear ' im talk . But every time I listen he gets ahead of me . So I 've quit listening to him . I found out he 's a sly old fox . " Young Charlie took his water jug and went back to the field . The next morning when Old Op walked up to our well in the front yard where he 'd filled his water jugs for twenty-five years , he started drawing water . I was feeding the birds . Day was just breaking . " You 're stirring early , Op , " I said . " Yep , I 'm a-havin ' to do the work of two men to make a showin ' in that pasture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wo n't work for a man unless I can make a showing . This Young Charlie Cotton is awful slow . Sometime , I 'd like to go into the field just with you and show you the work he 's done and I 've done . I 'll show you the difference in the Morgan and the Greenup County champions . If he 's the best sprout-cutter in Morgan County , the county judge had better call him home . " I knew what Old Op was trying to do . This was what had happened to all the men who had worked with him . Charliep212Cotton was crowding Old Op or he would n't be stirring this early . Old Op was getting out early so he could have a through of brush cut up the slope before Young Charlie got there . And when Young Charlie came , Old Op would tell him he 'd been there only a few minutes . He had done me this way . It was funny after you caught on to Old Op . But I figured Young Charlie might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch on . When Young Charlie passed my house an hour later with his water jug , his short legs were swinging like pendulums on his long torso . He waved to me as he went by . " Seen Old Uncle Op ? " he shouted . " He 's already gone to his work , " I said . Young Charlie 's legs worked faster . The next morning Young Charlie went by himself . I did n't see Old Op go up the valley . At noon Old Op came by and filled his jug at the well . " I 'm just like a mule , " he said . " When I get used to a good place to drink , I never want to leave it . " " I did n't see you go up this morning , Op , " I said . " Thought I 'd better take a half day off and give Young Charlie Cotton a chance , " he said . " Give him time to get caught up with me . We 've not worked two weeks yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be able to take it much longer . I 'm showing you the difference in the Greenup and the Morgan County sprout-cutting champions . And I 'm telling the people , too . Young Charlie ca n't stand me much longer . " When Old Op left my well , I watched him walk up the valley at an easy gait , swinging the jug he held in his old tough hand that was gnarled like the exposed roots of an ancient beech . His hairy arm dangled in the blue wind like a black stocking . He walked on reluctantly toward the field . On the second Saturday , I paid Old Op first . Young Charliep213came later . I paid him in cash for he wanted money he could see , feel with his coarse fingers , and hold in his hand . He did n't want a piece of paper where he had to make his cross , then have someone sign it for him . After I paid him in cash , he motioned with a sweep of his hands for me to come closer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whispered . " Sure you can , Young Charlie , " I told him . " Feel free to do so . " " The day Old Uncle Op did n't work , somebody whistled at my wife , " he said . " You know where we live , do n't you ? Down there on the hill in that little house of Fonse Doore 's . Well , she said a man stood down in the hollow below the house , motioning with his hand for her to come to him when he whistled . " " That could n't have been Old Op , " I said . " He 's seventysevenand a great-grandfather many times . " " But she said it looked plaim-blank like Old Uncle Op , " he said . " The man could n't be , " I said . " I never heard of his whistling at women . " " But you do n't know him , " Young Charlie said . " He 's been telling me about the things he 's done . And that old man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to him a-coining early to beat me . He 's found out I can do the work of three men . I 'm a-slowing Old Uncle Op down . We 're in the third week now . If we get another week together I 'll get ' im . " But you 'll never get another week with him , I thought . Old Op wo n't be defeated . He 'll still be the champion . The following morning Old Op did n't go to work . And I saw Young Charlie hurry down the road at about ten . At one in the afternoon I saw Old Op and Young Charlie go up the valley toward the pasture together . They were laughing and talking friendly-like to each other . That afternoon Young Charlie came down from the clear/ing first . I stopped him to ask how he was getting along . " All right in the clearing , " he said . " But that man has been back whistling at my wife . She said he stood down below the house and whistled again . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he looked plaim-blank like Old Uncle Op . " The next morning Old Op went up early . But this time Young Charlie Cotton did n't go up the valley . The next morning he did n't go up either . Old Op passed , filled his jug , while I talked to him at the well . " What 's the matter with Young Charlie ? " I asked . " Two mornings he 's not gone to work . " " He 's got more than he can do to work with me , " Old Op said . " I do n't like to brag on myself but Young Charlie just ca n't take it . I 'm two days ahead of him . He 's ashamed of himself because he let me beat him . " The week passed and I paid Old Op , but Young Charlie did n't come for his pay . I asked Old Op if he would walk a quarter of a mile out of his way to their little house and he said he would . He said he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday morning . Saturday night Old Op was off to town to see a movie . After the movie he always treated himself to a steak at The Dinner Bell . Then he smoked a half-dozen long black cigars while he walked over town . He was a Saturday-nighter . Old Op never missed a Saturday night western , his steak , and his black cigars . He told me he was always tied to a steak on Saturday night at The Dinner Bell . " Well , Young Charlie and his spouse have gone , " he said . He could n't hold his lips in place to give himself a serious expression . There was that twinkle in his partly good eye . And the eye in the deep socket with the almost sightless stare expressedhappiness too . " See , he just could n't work with me . He 's nearly a week behind up there in the clearing now . Say , you know there 's an awful lot of talk about that young boogerp215and that common-law wife ! I did n't mean to disgrace myself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the champion sprout-cutter from old Morgan . " Then Old Op gave that little pheasant-hen 's cackle after she 's laid an egg . He burst out into an explosive cackling . " Where did he leave the tools ? " I asked Old Op . " I 've been up there and I ca n't find ' em . He 's done something with my new bush blade , mattock , sprouting hoe , and ax . " " It 's hard to tell , " Op said . " You ca n't tell about these strangers . Not until you test one . He was n't a champion like he claimed to be ! " " I owe ' im for three days ' work , too , " I said . " He must have had some reason for leaving . " " They 're liable never to come back , " Old Op said , grinning . " It 's hard tellin ' where they are . " Another week had passed before Old Op told me Young Charlie and his wife had gone to Dartmouth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and they were all arrested and put in jail for drinking . I phoned the two city jails and the county jail and Young Charlie and his wife were not in any jail there . Then I heard where Young Charlie and his wife had worked a few days for a man in the west part of our county to get enough money to leave . Young Charlie sent me word he would not be back and that he had left my tools by an old stump at the edge of his clearing . I went there and found the tools just where he said he had left them . Almost to the top of the hill I saw Old Op flaying the sprouts . He was silhouetted against a patch of blue sky . In another hour he would have his half of the clearing finished.  |p216W  hen a man has lived fourscore , ten , and four years he 's lived a long time , " Pa said to Mom . " I know it hurts . I loved Old Dad like a father . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I stood lookin ' at Grandpa . The wind came through the window and lifted his white corn-silk beard . The big square-shouldered **27;11078;TOOLONG timbercutterwith the gnarled fire-shovel hands was silent now . His big chest did not expand now like it used to do when he swung a double-bitted ax to cut a giant tough-butted whiteoak . " You know why Mom is weepin ' ? " Finn whispered to me . " No , " I said . " It 's Grandpa 's funeral , " he said . " Bass has notified everybody . They 'll soon be a-comin ' . " I knew our family would have trouble over whether a mm-16p217ister of the Old Faith or one of the New Faith would preach his funeral . I knew that our people were divided and the two churches did n't agree on anything . And now the time had come for a showdown . Grandpa had leaned toward the Old Faith since one of their ministers had baptized him ; yet Grandpa had n't gone all the way with them since he believed in education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of their ministers had learned to read , they claimed that they had seen the " light " and just started reading . Mom leaned toward the Old Faith because Grandpa did . " Do n't haf to go to school to lam to read , " Uncle Radner once told Finn . " Just have the faith and open the Word and read . " " That 's a lot easier than goin ' to school , Uncle Radner , " Finn said . Mom wrung her hands and cried until she could n't cry . She sat in a chair and sobbed , and Pa stood behind her tellin ' her not to take it so hard , since Death would slip up on a man most any time after he passed fourscore and ten years . But Mom would n't listen . Finn and I knew Mom must be thinkin ' about tomorrow . " I 'll have something to say about who preaches the funeral , Finn , " I said . " Grandpa told me no longer than last summer he wanted me to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry them out like he planned ? " Finn asked . " Are you goin ' to see that he is buried in his shirttail and underwear ? " " He changed his mind about that , " I said . " What about the wild cherry homemade coffin ? " Finn asked . " Do n't have the lumber , " I said . " Good , " Finn said . " That will surprise the members of the Old Faith . They do n't believe in store-bought coffins . "  | " And I 'm goin ' to have an undertaker , " I said . " You 'll have many of the Old Faith to bury , " Finn said . " And I 'm goin ' to have Reverend Todd Hunter to preach his funeral , " I said . " He 's neither a minister of the Old or the New Faith , and this will bring peace among us . " " You 'll never do that without a fight , " Finn said . " Uncle Radner will never have a minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What will they say about the flowers ? " I asked Finn . " Wo n't that surprise our kinfolks of the Old Faith ? " " All you plan will go well with our blood kin of the New Faith , " Finn said . " But our blood kin of the Old Faith wo n't have any of it . " " They 'll have it too , " I said . " We 've always done what Grandpa wanted us to do . He wanted me to be in charge of his funeral and I 'm goin ' to handle it ! " " Look , Uncle Radner and Aunt Mallie , " Finn whispered . " Take it easy , Sall , " Uncle Radner said as he patted Mom on the back with his big hand . " Old Dad 's better off than we are . He 's gone to the Glory Land . He 's with Mel Sperry , Tim Cunningham , Alex Spry , and all the old timber cutters who lived accordin ' to the Word . " " Yes , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pap is better off . " Mom did n't answer Uncle Radner and Aunt Mallie . She could n't answer them for sobbing . " Who has charge of the funeral ? " Uncle Radner asked Pa . " Old Dad told Shan to look about everything , " Pa said . " How did that come about ? " Uncle Radner asked Pa . " What about one of us of the Old Faith ? " Then Uncle Radner turned to me and said , " Who 'd ye get to preach Old Dad 's funeral , Shan ? " " I 'm goin ' to get Reverend Todd Hunter , " I said . " He 's not a man of our faith , " Uncle Radner said . " I won'tp219have ' im . I wo n't have ' im no more than I 'd have one of the New Faith . " " I told you , " Finn whispered . Now the crowd of our blood kin began to walk up the paths to our house . There were long lines of them walking single file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls and women carryin ' babies and their husbands carryin ' one or two who were nearly babies , and there were old men and women walkin ' behind with canes . They were all akin to Grandpa by marriage or the blood stream . Most of them had descended from him ; fifty-three grandchildren and their familiesand his great grandchildren . " We 'll talk this thing over , Shan , " Uncle Radner said . " No use to talk it over , " I said . " We 're goin ' to have ReverendTodd Hunter . " Uncle Radner , who was six feet and nine inches tall , stood looking down at me when he talked . Fire danced in his eyes . We finally compromised on the coffin and flowers , and I was to let him choose the minister . I had to do it anyway , or there would have been a fight in our yard . He agreed to let me have an undertaker instead of haulin ' Grandpa to Plum Grove on our jolt wagon with our mules . It would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among our blood kin with a big smile on his face and said that Brother Adam Flint , a preacher of the Old Faith , would preach Grandpa 's funeral . I saw many happy faces among our people , and I saw just as many clouded and sullen faces . Mom must have thought everything was settled , for she stopped weepin ' . She talked to many of our kinfolks that she had n't seen for years , though they lived a few miles from us in another hollow or valley . There was much talkin ' and handshakin ' among us . And as night came on the talkin ' died and there were a few songs . Our kinfolks of the Old Faith did their kind of singin ' . They read a line and then they sang it withp220long whines and sobs that sent chills over our bodies . Since we were descended from the same blood stream , our grandpa , I wondered how we could be so different . And I wondered which side Grandpa would have taken if he could have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith got together in our kitchen and talked to one another . We knew they were up to something . They were Uncle Radner , Reverend Flint , Cousin Erf , Keen , Dudley , Tim , Cy , and Winton Shelton . Uncle Darius , Uncle Pratt , Uncle Sizemore , and Uncle Sneed were tryin ' to whisper to Reverend Flint at the same time . Mom would n't take either side . Pa would n't . But Uncle Jason was on our side . Cousins Ednor , Elva , George , Dave , Edith , Carrie , Nancy , Belle , Lucretia , and more than a hundred others were members of the New Faith . Even Uncle Mace was with us , since he believed in education and had tried to educate his children . Pa was interested in seeing that everybody got enough to eat and enough coffee to drink after our sleepless night . And as the mornin ' came and the darkness cleared away , we knew the day of decision was before us . We knew Mom had always wanted Grandpa to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it after he passed the fourscore and ten years . It was then Grandpa was baptized and started thinkin ' about the world beyond and how he wanted to be dressed when he entered the next world . And it was then he put his ax , maul , sledge hammers , and crosscut saws away . He said that he had cut timber since he was fourteen and now it was time to retire . He said at the age of ninety a man should stop his daily toil and start preparations for the next world . I thought of this as I looked at him in his long sleep . I thought of it more after I saw him in the big coffin which was hardly broad enough for his shoulders . I thought it was a terribly small place to put this mountain of a man who wasp221used to the freedom of the ax and crosscut saw and the timberedmountain slopes . I had seen him work stripped to the waist when the winter winds blew and the weather was below zero . I had seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single day when two men workin ' with him only cut sixty-nine in the same kind of corn . All this was over . He was confined at last . " Boys , there is no use to gear the mules to haul Old Dad to that newfangled deadwagon , " Uncle Radner said . " He 's got enough grandsons to tote ' im . " Just as soon as Uncle Radner spoke these words , six cousins of the Old Faith hurried inside the house to get Grandpa . And six of the New Faith hurried inside too . Mom started weepin ' again , and Aunt Mallie wept like her heart would break . There was silence among the funeral crowd . But it happened that three of the Old Faith took one side of the coffin and three of the New Faith took the other side . We walked down the narrow path where the mud was shoe-mouth deep , with the great crowd of our blood kin followin ' . We did n't speak across the coffin to our cousins and they did n't speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talked to one another . When we reached the ambulance at the turnpike and had put Grandpa inside , our cousins of the New Faith , Nancy , Belle , and Lucretia , came with wreaths of flowers and laid them on Grandpa 's coffin . There were many clouded faces among our cousins , aunts , uncles , and distant blood kin of the Old Faith . The ambulance took Grandpa toward Plum Grove . When we reached Plum Grove , our kinfolks of the Old Faith took seats on the left side of the church house and we took seats on the right where the winter wind whistled through the broken windowpanes . When Reverend Adam Flint started preaching Grandpa 's funeral , he spoke of the visions he had seen when he was ap222boy in the cornfield . And how he had seen the light when it came to him . And how he had never gone to school but soon after he saw the light he could read the Word . He was a big man , and he looked like a gorilla when he lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at us of the New Faith . Brother Finn nudged me when Reverend Adam Flint said that members of the Old Faith were the only ones with a promise of the Glory Land . Brother Finn 's face got red . Uncle Jason , a big **28;11107;TOOLONG man , squirmed in his seat . Uncle Mace nervously fumbled the hat he held in his hand . Reverend Adam Flint seldom mentioned Grandpa while he preached his funeral . He did n't mention the religious life Grandpa had lived after he had passed his fourscore years and ten . He did n't mention the good life Grandpa had lived in the ninety years before he became a member of the Church of the Old Faith . He did n't tell how Grandpa , who had never gone to school a day in his life , had struggled to learn to read . He did n't tell that Grandpa had read as many as a hundred books a year . He did n't mention how Grandpa had encouraged his grandchildren to go to school and to become schoolteachers . But Reverend Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against music . He pointed to the organ in the Church of the New Faith and said it should n't be there . He looked at the thirty-seven schoolteachers on our side of the church and spoke against the evils of education while we looked at one another and at him . And our blood kin of the Old Faith looked at us across the aisle . Whether they rejoiced watching our faces turn red , I do n't know . But Uncle Radner , leader of the Old Faith , rejoiced . While Reverend Adam Flint preached against education there was a new light in Uncle Radner 's face . For Uncle Radner could n't read and write himself . Since he could n't read and write , he thoughtp223education was folly . He thought it was public expense for absolutely nothing . Why we should be hearing all about the evils of education , flowers , and music at Grandpa 's funeral was something we could n't understand . We had to sit in our seats and twist and squirm with our faces hot and then cold for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was in my heart to say , " ReverendAdam Flint said . " I have something to read here for the old brethren whose temple of clay we are about to rejoin with the earth . But , " he said , fumbling at his vest pocket with his big gnarled fingers , " I have left my glasses at home and I ca n't read without ' em . " Then something happened on our side of the church . Everybody relaxed in his seat . And we looked at one another . Many of the schoolteachers looked strangely at each other . " Reverend Flint , that 's Grandpa 's obituary you have , " Finn said as he got up from his seat . " And , if you do n't mind , I 'll read it . You know , " Finn spoke softly , " this is where educationcomes in handy . " Then lights sparkled in the faces on our side of the church . Our aunts , uncles , first , second , and third cousins , and our in-laws on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We could not help looking across the aisle at them . Uncle Radner , for the first time , looked down at the floor . Finn 's trained voice spoke the words so fluently that you caught each one and held it firmly in your memory . " We wo n't have music , " Reverend Flint said as soon as Finn finished reading Grandpa 's obituary . " I 'll sing you a song from the Old Sweet Songster . " Reverend Adam Flint read a line . Then he tried to sing it . He did n't carry the tune . His voice went high and low . But not one of our side of the church made a noise . We listened intently to his singing . Something happened toward our feeling for him , since he could n't read Grandpa 's obituary . Soonp224as he was through with his song , Cousin Lucretia arose from her seat and said , " Let us sing Rock of Ages . ' I 'll play the organ . " Cousin Lucretia played the organ softly , sweetly , sadly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church . Membersof the Old Faith looked at each other . But they held the same respect for us we had held for them . Cousin Lucretia played " Land Beyond the River . " We sang it while they had to listen . We had listened to them for a long long time . And we had respected them . Now they were listening to us . And they respected us . " Now we 'll consign the old brethren 's dust whence it came , " Reverend Adam Flint said as soon as we were through singing . The same pallbearers that had carried Grandpa from our home to the ambulance carried him from the Plum Grove Church to the cemetery . Has death brought about a compromise between us , I wondered . When Cousins Mary , Lucretia , and Glenna put flowers on Grandpa 's coffin , our blood kin and in-laws of the Old Faith did n't try to take them off . Uncle Radner had warned us that they would if we brought flowers . When Reverend Adam Flint consigned Grandpa to the dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we stood with heads bowed , we accepted with reverence all he did and said . " Now we 'll take charge of the grave , " Dink Wampus , the Plum Grove sexton , said , soon as the services were over . His two helpers , tall beardy-faced men , stepped forward to the graveside with their long-handle shovels . " And I 'll take care o ' you , " Uncle Radner shouted as he popped Uncle Mace square on the nose with his big fist . " I 've been a-wantin ' to do this for a long time ! Old Dad 's under the ground and the time is right ! "  |p225At  first Uncle Mace was stunned . Then he reached for one of the shovels , but the gravedigger held onto it . Uncle Radner popped Uncle Mace another time on the face . " You have to fight , " Uncle Radner shouted . Then Uncle Mace came up with a haymaker and Uncle Radner fell across the pile of fresh dirt at Grandpa 's grave . " You 've hurt Radner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than he hurt me , " Uncle Mace said . " Struck like a copperhead when I was least expectin ' it ! I ought to bash his damned face in with my heel ! " Grandpa 's death a compromise , I thought , as I watched members of the Old and the New Faith tangle in the graveyardsince Uncle Radner had struck the first lick . " Boys , be careful with the tombstones , " Uncle Jason shouted as Cousins Erf , Keen , Dudley , Tim , Cy , and Winton tangled with Cousins Ednor , Elva , Gleen , Lige , Cief , and Brother Finn . Brother Finn caught Dudley under the chin and upended him . I never saw as many fists flying . I never heard so much screaming . " Women , go to the church house ! " Dink Wampus shouted . " Hurry ! Get there ! " Then , instead of trying to fill the grave , Dink Wampus and his men tried to separate the fighting men . " It 's no use , " Uncle Sizemore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showdown between us . Let ' em fight ! " " I 'll show you what a real showdown is , " Uncle Jason said as he put his two hundred and ninety pounds behind a powerfulblow that lifted Uncle Sizemore across two graves . Uncle Sizemore hit between two mounds and lay there . Cousin Cy was getting the better of Brother Finn until he backed Finn upon a grave where Finn had the advantage . Finn caught him with a lick behind the ear and knocked him cuckoo . He fell across the fresh mound beside Uncle Radner . Uncle Darius , Uncle Sneed , and Uncle Pratt tangled withp226Uncle John , Uncle Mort , and Uncle Sam . I never saw so many bleeding noses . Everybody was fighting but Reverend Adam Flint and me . All our wives , sisters , mothers , aunts , and great-aunts had reached the churchyard where they stood weeping and watching the fight . Once I thought I 'd hit Reverend Adam Flint . Then I saw Cousin Keen Shelton start to hit Finn over the head with a tree root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two brothers . I caught Keen on the chin as he was coming over with the root with such a blow that my arm ached to my shoulder . The root fell from Keen 's hands and he twisted to the ground like he was out for good . When Reverend Adam Flint saw me hit Keen he must have thought he was next . He started running down among the tombstones , and Uncle Mace picked up a clod of hard dirt and threw it straight as a bullet at his head . It struck Reverend Adam Flint on top of the head , knocked his hat off , but he never stopped running . He ran to the far end of the graveyard and leaped the low fence and ran down across Barger 's sheep pasture toward the main traveled road . " That 's a good riddance , Mace , " Uncle Sam said . " Pity you did n't hit ' im with a rock instead of a clod . " The fight started at about four o'clock and lasted until nearly five . Members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they did n't get it in the churchyard . We had about thirty of their men on the ground at once . Down between the old graves and across graves and every place the ground would hold them . They had twenty or more of our men down . But when Uncle Radner came to his senses and saw all the men on the ground and heard the lamenting cries and wails of the mothers , lovers , sweethearts , wives , sisters , and aunts from the churchyard , he was the first to say , " Let us have peace , brother ! Let 's stop this fight . " " Have you members of the Old Faith had enough ? " Uncle Mace asked  | " Plenty , " Uncle Radner said , for he was scared . Then the fighting stopped . We had to pull several of the men apart and made them stop biting , gouging , hitting , and clawing . There was blood on the ground . Tombstones , pots of flowers , and vases with faded flowers were turned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 'll take a long time to straighten this place up , " Dink Wampus said , shaking his head sadly . " Never a fight like this one happened here ! I 've never seen anything like this before . It 's a disgrace ! " Then the women rushed back to the churchyard to claim their own . Aunt Mallie ran to Uncle Radner and put her arms around him . And our cousins of the New Faith helped cousins of the New Faith and cousins of the Old Faith helped cousins of the Old Faith . Each took care of his own faith . Not a word was spoken between the factions as we helped our wounded from the Plum Grove graveyard . They gathered their wounded and carried their sleeping from the hill ahead of us . There were consoling words from the women to the men as they left the graveyard before we did . We followed , bringing our wounded and carrying our cousins that had not wakened . We left Dink Wampus and his two helpers shovelingthe dirt into Grandpa 's grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one where both faiths have to attend the same funeral , " Uncle Mace said as he rubbed his bruised hand gently with his good hand . " From now on , let the Old Faith bury their dead and we 'll bury our own . "  |p228How  old Alec ever got on my farm I 'll never know . Dad said when he bought the farm for me while I was in Scotland that there was n't anybody living in either of the shacks , made by the lumberjacks while they were cutting the timber . I know it was a surprise to me that October morning when I went out to round up the cattle and drive them to the barn after the first sharp frost had fallen . For I saw a stream of wood smoke ascending from the rough-stone flue of the one-room shack near the big barn where the lumberjackshad kept twenty yoke of oxen . Soon as I knocked on the door , the latch turned and I stood facing an old man with black beard and long **26;11137;TOOLONG . He squinted his black beady eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anybody was living here , " I said . " Well , you know it now . " The old man spoke friendly ,  |p229laughing  at his own words . " Ye 've got old Alec on your place and he 'll never do ye any harm . " I stood looking first at him and then inside at his old pieces of furniture . " Did you move here after I bought the place ? " I asked . " I do n't know , " he said . " When did you buy the place ? " " To be exact , four months ago today , " I said . " Oh , yes , " he said , laughing . " I moved here a couple of months ago . " " The least thing you could have done was to notify me you 'd moved in , " I said , my temper rising . " Thought I might hunt and fish a little , " Alec said as I stood thinking about what to do . " And I just wondered what you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe ye 'd want to raise some terbacker and ye 'd hang it right thar in that barn . " " That would n't be a bad idea , " I said . " I 'd never thought of that before ! " " Well , ye know that barn oughten to be out here without anybody a-livin ' here to pertect it , " Alec said . " Thought I could do that much fer whoever owns this land . Remember there 's a lot of strangers allus a-prowlin ' through these woods . " Once I thought I 'd tell Alec to get out . Then I changed my mind . It 's not a bad idea to have someone living out here to look over this big barn , I thought . Alec might be all right . And who else could I get to live in a shack like this ? I left Alec standing in the door . I went to round up my cattle , and drive them from the frostbitten brown pasture to the cattle barn . But as I drove the cattle home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept thinking about him and planned to climb the ridge road again to see him . But one morning early when I was taking the ashes from the fireplacebefore I built a fire , I looked through the window andp230saw Alec coming down the hollow with a string of fish . " Thought you might like a mess of fresh bass , " he said soon as I opened the door . " Sure would , " I said , looking at the nice catch he 'd brought me . " How did you catch them ? " " Hook and line , " he said . " That 's all I ever use . I can beat the men who set trotlines . They do n't know how to fish . They do n't know how to bait thar hooks . " " How much do you want for these fish ? " I asked . " Oh , nothing , " he said . " Not a red penny . Remember I live in your place . " That was the last time I saw Alec until hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbits , quails , and he brought my wife a red fox pelt . In late autumn he brought us a bushel of black walnuts , a peck of butternuts , and a gallon of hazelnuts . He brought us pawpaws and persimmons . We offered him pay for these but he refused . After the snows came I never saw anything of Alec . Althoughhe lived not over two miles from me , I was never near his shack . I heard that he was trapping that winter . Often I 'd seen tracks in the snow from one rock cliff den to another and believed these were his tracks . Early next spring after the snows had melted and the water had run from the high hills , Alec came down with some yellow root . He told me if my stomach ever cramped me to chew a little and swallow the juice . When the trees had begun to bud and leaf , I climbed the high hill to his shack to see what was going on . Without asking me , he had spaded himself a garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the shack , barn , and garden . " I never liked sprouty fence rows , " Alec said . " So I 've cleaned this place up ! " " It looks wonderful , Alec , " I said . " Look at the work you'vep231done around here . How much do I owe you for all this work ? " " Not a red penny , " he said . " When a body 's got a home he ought a keep it fixed up , do n't ye think ? " Alec talked like the place belonged to him . But I knew the laws of Kentucky well enough to know he could n't take my land for which I had the deed , until after he had paid the taxes on the land for a number of years . One day that May when I was in town , I saw Mrs. Harris cleaning some very pretty wild strawberries . I asked her where she was able to get such pretty berries and she told me they came from my farm . " I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Who brought them to you ? " " An old man by the name of Alec  --  just Alec , " she said . " Then I 'll get him to pick us some , " I said . " I 'd like to know where they grow . " Alec brought us finer wild strawberries than he had sold Mrs. Harris . He brought us wild raspberries when we could n't find any on the farm . He knew where they grew same as he knew where to find the butternuts , walnuts , hazelnuts , persimmons , and pawpaws . He knew where all wild berries grew , for he brought us dewberries , huckleberries , and wild gooseberries . When we wanted something that grew wild , whether it was berry , shrub , fruit , or flower , all we had to do was ask Alec to find it for us . When we wanted a mess of wild game or fresh fish , all we had to do was to ask Alec to bring them to us . I never asked Alec to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed help . I left him alone to take care of the barn and shack . For I knew he was past the age when most men retire . But I was surprised when I walked over the big pasture that was near his shack . I was walking along and came to a place where a thicket of bushes and briers had been cut . The thicket had been cut , four acres or more , clean as a meadow.  |p232And  this was a place in the pasture field where the sprouts and briers were shading the grass . The slopes where the sprouts and briers were not too high had been left alone . ' When I came to the cross fence , I found the brush and briers had been cut , leaving it clean as a pawpaw whistle . Alec had done it . He worked where he wanted to , when he wanted to , and that was all there was to it . He had cut dead trees near the fence so they would n't fall in a windstorm and smash it and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been cut . Alec had taken care to see that the cattle would n't be in danger of an old tree falling on them when they went for water . I tried to get Alec to take pay but he would not . " I 'm glad I let him stay in that shack , " I said to myself . After he had lived two years on my place , I got better acquainted with Alec . He told me that he was once happily married and that his wife had been dead ten years or more , that his children had grown up and had gone to the industrial cities in northern Ohio . And that he was very happy living alone , without anybody near him . He said he wanted to live where he was living now the rest of his days . Then came the war , and after I was in it my father and uncle needed help trying to raise and harvest crops . When they called on Alec to help them , he was willing and ready and my father sent me word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alec 's help had saved them . Said he could do more with an ax , a spade , or a hoe than any man he had ever seen . Said he was the neatest worker he 'd ever seen on a farm . When they hung the tobacco in the high barn , I wondered who would climb up among the stay poles and do the hanging . My mother wrote me that Alec could climb like a squirrel and he had saved the tobacco crop . And then she told me that Alec had two sons in the Army , one in Europe and one in the Pacific . I had never known before about Alec 's sons . They had gone into service from Ohio.  |p233When  I was in service , my wife could n't run the place any longer . She moved to town after eight months to live with her parents , and later she lived with me when I was stationed in Washington . She pulled the shades down at oui house and closed the doors . But Alec came and cut the grass in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come down from the steep hills and burn the house . Alec looked over the entire farm , hunted , fished , trapped , worked , gathered nuts , and picked berries as he had always done . War or no war , he would do these things . When I was released from the Navy and came home , Alec was not living alone in the shack . His son , who had been in service five years , forty-two months of that time served in the Pacific , was at home with him . I wondered how a young man used to Army life would like a one-room shack without a single modern convenience but Ronald said after his being with many men , he was fond of solitude and loved the oneroomshack . Said he would like it for some time to come . In three weeks another son came to live with his father : Dave , who had not passed a physical for military service , but one who had worked for farmers in Ohio while the war was on . Then , I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of the hill into an empty four-room shack . " Nope , I wo n't leave this place , " he said . " We are all right . Three can live comfortably here . " Then another son , Tim , came home from the war and this was the only home he had in America , this one-room shack where his father lived , and loved and called his home . Then I went to see Alec to persuade him to move since I knew it was nearly impossible for four to live in one room . " Nope , we can make it here . " Alec spoke for his returning family . " I expect to stay here long as I live . " Why Alec did n't want to move to four rooms down beside the wagon road , where a few automobiles passed , was more than I could understand . This four-room shack did have ap234road to it . And there was a good well in the yard . He would n't have to carry water like he did back on the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge . 1But something happened . Alec 's daughter , Sue , came home from a city in Ohio where she had worked in a restaurant duringthe war . She did n't come alone . She came home with a baby and without a husband . He welcomed Sue home and was proud of her baby . He regarded her as a war casualty more than either of his sons . He did n't act like a grandfather to her baby but he acted like a father . Now I knew his three sons , his daughter and her baby , and Alec could n't live in one room . I wondered how they would dress and how they would sleep . When I went to see Alec , I found him in the big barn changing his clothes . He had his sons move their clothes to the barn so they could dress . He had partitioned their one room with sheets and quilts and had a bed in one end for Sue and the baby . Three of the boys were sleeping in the other end and Alec was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew this would n't work . And I told Alec I did n't want anything like this on the place when I had an empty shack waiting for him . But Alec would n't listen . " But your family is back with you , " I protested . " How in  --  the world are you going to do it ? It 's not sanitary ! It 's awful ! " My patience was tried . I was getting tired of fooling with Alec . I left the hill in disgust . A week later Alec came down to see me . " Guess I 'll haf to move , " he said . " But I ai n't moving because of room . My baby needs a room and it ca n't sleep and so many of us in one room ! Just too much noise ! Even the foxhounds wake my baby . If I move down at the shack in the gap , we 'll hear less of the foxhounds . " " Now you 're talking , " I said . " You 'll need my mules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alec said , shaking his head sadly .  | " I 'll have Gore to help you move , " I said . " When do you want him to bring the team ? " " Oh , in the mornin 'll be all right , " Alec muttered . Early next morning Gore and I took the team ' and wagon up the old log road to Alec 's shack . When we arrived , Alec was out in the yard . " We finally got here , Alec , " Gore said , just as Ronald , Tim , and Dave came out the door . " The boys will load the wagon . " Alec spoke softly . " They got everything ready to load on . " Ye might think I 'm a little contrary about not a-wantin ' to leave here , " Alec said to me as Gore and his sons carried their scant possessions to the wagon . " I never did tell ye the reason . Reckon I might as well . I built this shack . " " You built that shack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alec said . " I built it a long time ago when old Sam Dexter owned this land . That was when ye 's a little boy living down at the mouth of W-Hollow . Biddie and I lived here twenty-three years . Our young'uns wuz all born in that shack . There 's only one tree in that whole house , " Alec talked on . " It 's a big white-oak . I rive enough boards to kivver it from the two butt-cuts and I had the rest sawed at Dave Snyder 's mill . I carried the planks up this mountain on my back . I sold hen eggs fer six cents a dozen and bought the nails . " " I did n't know that , " I said . " I knowed ye did n't the day ye come out here , " Alec said . " But I lived here long as Sam Dexter owned this land and timber . And when Jason Radnor bought it , he made me move so the lumberjacks could use my shack . They built that big barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timber cut and got out I was a-comin ' back . " " But now your family is too big for one room , Alec , " I said . " Yep , ye 're right , " Alec agreed . " More a-comin ' on andp236we 've got to have more room . " But Alec talked as the last pieces of furniture were piled upon the wagon . " Sam Dexter told me that this was my shack and if I ever had to leave it ferever , I could tear it down . " The furniture was loaded , and Gore climbed up on the wagon . He drove the mules away , down the log road toward the gap . Tim , Ronald , and Dave followed the wagon , each carrying a picture , something breakable , or a family heirloom . Sue walked with them with her baby in her arms . When the procession left the mountain , I followed but Alec remained . We had just time to make the first sharp turn when I heard Alec 's hammer and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back or said a word . Though this shack was on the land I owned , I knew it really did n't belong to me.  | It was n't good daylight when somebody rapped loudly on my front door . Wonder who 's come this early , I thought as I walked toward the door . When I opened the door , Pa was standing there . He had a worried look on his face . I knew something was wrong . " Old Dick 's awful sick , " were Pa 's first words . " Wonder if you 'd jump in the car and go with me to get Wash . We 've got to get somebody since we do n't have a mule doctor anywhere in these parts . " " What 's wrong with ' im , Pa ? " I asked . " I do n't know , " Pa said . " For seventeen years , I 've gone every morning at four o'clock to feed Dick and Dinah . I 've never missed more than ten mornings . And they 've been standing wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Dinah greeted me . I wondered about Old Dick . I found ' im stretched on his stall beddin ' . He got up to greet me . But he had to lie back down . He 'd kicked the partition down durin ' $37p238the night . He 'd kicked boards loose from the stall . He 'd sufferedsomething awful . It nearly broke my heart to see ' im in so much misery ! It was a-hurtin ' old Dinah too . I put corn in her box and hay in her manger but she was n't eatin ' . She was a-standin ' there lookin ' at Old Dick a-moanin ' and a-carryin ' on something awful at her feet . " " I 've not had breakfast , " I said . " Would I have time to wait for a cup of coffee ? " " I did n't take time for breakfast either , " Pa said . " If we get Wash in time we might save Old Dick . We have to work fast . I can do without the coffee and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Pa wanted me to go . He wanted me to move in a hurry . And I did . I hurried to the garage and started the car . " Old Dick picked a muddy time to get sick , " I said . " This road has never been worse this winter . Lucky I 've already got chains on the car . " It was still so dark I had to switch on my headlights . I could n't see the deep dark ruts well enough to miss them . I did n't miss all of them . I could n't . The car lunged and plunged from deep ruts to deeper ruts , then came up again with muck dripping from bumper , fenders , and running boards . It was tough driving . I used all the gears and used them fast . Though Pa never liked to ride in an automobile on slick roads he did n't mind now . He did n't grumble and tell me to slow down and watch what I was doing as he had often told me when we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wash Nelson to doctor Old Dick . And Pa told me to step on the gas . Drive as fast and careful as I could and make as fast a time . How I ever got out of W-Hollow was a miracle . When I reached Route i , a macadamized road , my car deposited a trail of W-Hollow mud for a mile or so . It dripped like heavy gobs of dark rain . " I got Dick and Dinah when they were five-year-olds , " Pap239said thoughtfully as I speeded the car down Route 1 . " They 're twenty-two years old now . That 's old for a span of mules . But neither one has ever been sick a day in his life ! What a span of mules ! Best pair of mules in Greenup County ! Yes , " Pa talked on , " I was a much younger man when I got that pair of mules . I was only fifty then . How I 've worked ' em ! How they 've worked me ! I 'd get up and go the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they 're not gentle mules , " I said to Pa as we left Route i and started up Academy Branch . " Old Dick 's kicked you three times ! " " But let me tell you , son , " Pa said . " It was all my fault . I never confessed this before . And it 's always hurt something inside me that I did n't . But Dick always expected his master to do things right . The first time he kicked me , I went inside his stall and started to put the harness over his back from the wrong side . That 's the time he kicked me on the shin and splintered the bone . Laid me up for nearly a month ! " " What about the time you started to put the bridle on him ? " I said . " What did you do wrong that time ? " " Had the wrong bridle , " Pa said . " Started to put old Dinah 's bridle on him . He broke a whole panel of ribs for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He laid me up for three months that time ! " " I 've always been afraid of his heels , " I said . " No need to be , son , if you do things right around that mule , " Pa bragged . " I know him . He 's a real mule . He does things right and expects you to do things right . The third and last time he kicked me , I made an awful mistake . I put him in the wagon on the off side when he worked on the near side . He really tried to get me that time . He nicked my chin with his steel shoe . He was kicking high for my head . " " And he 's kicked several others , too , " I said as we speeded over the graveled Academy Branch Road.  | " But they made mistakes , son , " Pa said . " Do n't you ever doubt it . " " Just two months ago , Dick kicked Old Alec , " I said . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right index finger ! " " Yes , and what was Old Alec a-doin ' to Dick ? " Pa asked me . " He was down on his knees hittin ' Old Dick up under the belly with his big black hat a-tryin ' to kill a knit-fly ! Old Dick knew that a man was supposed to kill one with his hand and not with a hat . And look what Jesse did , " Pa talked on . " When he went after that load of coal , he drove Dick and Dinah under a low coal tipple and their hames caught on the trackin ' . That 's why they charged when he went to fasten the breast chain and took off his finger . Son , your Uncle Jesse is a mule driver . He knows mules . And he knows he made a mistake . If anything happens to Old Dick , see how hard your Uncle Jesse takes it ! He 's worked them mules for the last nine years . He wo n't work the young mules ! You know that ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped the car . We got out . " You 're stirrin ' early , Mick , " a voice said . " Wash , " Pa said , " guess we 're lucky to catch you . We 've got an awful sick mule ! Can you go doctor him ? " " You got here just in time , " Wash said . " I 'd started to the sawmill . Sure I can go , Mick . Wait a minute until I run back to the house and get my medicine bag . " In less than three minutes we had Wash in the car with his little medicine bag . He and Pa sat in the back seat to give me more room to drive . As we speeded down Academy Branch Road Wash asked Pa questions about Old Dick . It did n't take me long to reach Route i and speed to the W-Hollow road . The car tossed , skidded , and rocked like a small ship on ap241stormy sea , but this did n't stop Pa from telling Wash about Old Dick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the gate waiting for us . " How 's Old Dick , Jesse ? " Pa asked . " He 's all right , I guess , " Uncle Jesse said , his lips trembling as he spoke , and his face was gray as morning mist . " He 's dead ! " " Dead , " Pa repeated as he looked at Wash . Then Pa looked at the ground . " Yes , I went after Gore , " Uncle Jesse said . " And I sent Gene after Old Alec . ' We did all we could for him ! In the years that I have worked Old Dick , I 've seen him in a lot of tight places pulling saw logs from the timber woods , pulling wagon loads of coal up mountain slopes , but I 've never seen ' im in a spot like he was in this mornin ' . He would n't give up until he had to . We got ' im out'n the barn and he laid down and got up again over a hundred times . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and fell over dead . " " That 's awful , " Pa said as he kicked at a clod of dirt with his brogan toe . " That 's tough . Poor Dick . " " Then there 's no need for me to go on , " Wash said . " I 'll take you home , " I said . Pa and Uncle Jesse walked silently up the hollow toward the barn . After I 'd taken Wash home , I stopped at my home for breakfast . It was still early . And then I went up to the barn where Pa , Uncle Jesse , Gore , and Old Alec were standinglooking at Old Dick where he had fallen on the barn lot . There Old Dick lay . It was the first time in seventeen years I 'd known him that I had ever seen him lie perfectly still . The old men gathered around him had worked him many a day . They , perhaps , were thinking about the days they had worked him and Dinah . Their memories were going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked atp242this powerful mule that was at last as silent as the earth on which he lay . Not one of them was saying a word . But Dinah , still fastened in her stall , was saying plenty . She was speaking in a language I did n't understand . I walked insidethe barn and looked into her manger . She had n't eaten her hay . I looked into her feedbox and the eight ears of yellow corn Pa had fed her at four o'clock had n't been touched . Dick , for the first time in all these years , was not by her side . Just yesterday I had seen Dick and Dinah running over the pasture hill , enjoying a day of freedom and running like rabbits over the old trails they had known for a long long time . They were nibbling each other playfully like two young lambs . They had made these trails through the woodlands in their pasture that had belonged to them all of the years we had owned them . Dick and Dinah knew each rock and tree , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the willow shades . These had belonged to them as much as the two stalls they had kept in the barn all of these years . We never allowed any other animal to occupy one of their stalls or know the secrets of their fifty acres of woodland and grass pasture . When I walked outside the barn , Dinah was kicking the plank wall behind her . " Dinah , stop that ! " I shouted , but my scolding did n't stop her kicking . Just as I walked back where the men were , standing silently around Old Dick , Mort Higgins came down the road . " Lost a mule , Mick ? " he said . " Too bad ! " " Yes , I 've lost a real mule . " Pa spoke softly . " Say , I 'll tell you how to save the trouble , work , and time burying him , " Mort said . " I 'm going to town and I can call the deadwagon and they 'll come right out here and get that mule ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the jaw , " Pa said.  | " You 're a good neighbor , but you do n't understand how I feel toward that mule ! " Uncle Jesse , Old Alec , and Wilfred Gore turned hard eyes toward Mort Higgins . They did n't speak . They just looked at Mort with unfriendly eyes . " Oh , I did n't know , Mick , you felt that way about a mule , " Mort said . " I 'm sorry I suggested the deadwagon . " " There wo n't be any deadwagon , Mort , " Pa said . " This mule will be buried on this farm . He 'll be buried in the dirt he 's a part of . Dirt that belongs to him as much as it does to me ! Mule that 's worked seventeen years for me , I 'll see that he 's buried when he dies . There wo n't be any more use made of ' im . I ca n't stand this idea of workin ' an animal till he dies , skinning ' im for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mort knew he 'd said the wrong thing . He turned and left us without saying another word . " Old Dick , you come nigh as a pea a-gettin ' me once , " Old Alec said . " If you 'd a hit me two inches lower you 'd a hit me over the ticker and it would 've been too bad . But it was my fault ! " " I 've made several mistakes , too , " Wilfred said . " But I was quick enough to dodge ! I learned a lot when I worked Old Dick and Dinah . Best mules I ever worked . Had goods mule sense . Knew more about work than a lot of men ! " Uncle Jesse stood there with his hand still bandaged where he had lost his finger . He did n't say anything . He just looked at Old Dick . First time I 'd ever seen him shed a tear . For Uncle Jesse was synonymous with this mule team . I 'd seen him , a big three-hundred-pound man , wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the farm with Old Dick and Dinah . He was working them when I went to college . He had worked them four days ago . I 'd seen him ride the mowing machine behind them in the heavy soybeans . I'dp244seen him drag saw logs from the timber woods with them . And I 'd seen him turn the cold March loam over with a big turning-plow in rooty ground on a steep hillside . I 'd seen him have them in tight places and they had always come through . When the young mules had stuck with a load uphill Uncle Jesse would never use Dick and Dinah . He would just hitch Old Dick to the tip of the wagon tongue and take the load up the hill . When my car stuck on the muddy W-Hollow road , embedded until mud ran over the running boards , Uncle Jesse would bring Dick to pull me out . Only once did he fail . That time he was pulling in the direction opposite home . When Dick 's head was turned toward home , he was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splintered wooden ones and broke hame strings and crushed collar pads and broke collars . Something had to snap . These things went through my mind as I stood watching Uncle Jesse as he looked at his beloved mule , Old Dick . " Where 's a good place to bury ' im , Jesse ? " Pa said . " I 've just been studyin ' , " Uncle Jesse said . " What about the gap where the cedar tree stands ? " I suggested . " Not there , " Gore said . " You once buried a cow there . You know how Old Dick always felt toward cattle ! " " He did n't like ' em , " Old Alec said . " I 'd be against buryin ' ' im there . " " The young mules could n't pull him up that little hill anyway , " Uncle Jesse said . " Old Dick 's a big mule . He 'll weigh eleven hundred ! That 's too much for the young mules to pull on the ground ! " " Old Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa said . " He pulled the cow up there by himself that we buried . She 'd weigh about that much ! " Drops of cool rain started falling and the soft drops dampened Old Dick 's clean hair.  | " What about buryin ' him at the edge of the pine grove near the gap ? " Uncle Jesse suggested . " It 's at the foot of the little hill where him and Dinah used to eat fodder and hay . It 's the place where they went to play and rest in summer when they did n't work . It 's the windbreak where they went in winter when we did n't have ' em in the barn . Seems to me it was Old Dick 's favorite spot in the pasture . " " That 's the right place , " Wilfred Gore said . " I think it is , too , " Pa said . Then Gore , Old Alec , and I got the mattocks and shovels while Pa and Uncle Jesse went into the barn to harness the young mules . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grove for us to dig the grave . Then he started digging with the big mattockwhile Gore and I shoveled . The big soft raindrops fell from the low clouds that raced over the low mountaintops like long thin-bellied greyhounds . Raindrops hit the green pine needles that swished in the slow-moving wind . " It 's a bad day to bury Old Dick , " Gore said . " But I 'd never see a deadwagon haul ' im off , " Old Alec said . " Mort Higgins does n't know how near he come a-gettin ' socked in the mouth . I 'm a peaceful man , too . " We sank a big hole rapidly into the soft mellow earth . We hit only a few pine roots , but Old Alec cut them with a mattock and pulled them up with his big gnarled hands . " We want his grave as near the pines as we can get it , " Old Alec said . Before we had finished digging the grave , Pa and Uncle Jesse came driving the young mules down the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain around his hind legs and the young mules pulled him as if he were a saw log . That was the only way we could haul him . We could n't load him on the wagon . But the young mules , Rock and Rye , knew instinctively they were not pulling a saw log . They whiffedp246the wind . They pranced in the harness . Pa had trouble holdingthem with the lines . " You ca n't fool a mule , " Pa said . " These young mules know that Old Dick is dead . He never had any respect for these young mules after he pulled the first wagonload of coal they stuck with on the hill . He pulled it from the tongue tip . After that he 'd never let these young mules come around him . But they respected him after he pulled their load . " " Every animal and person on this place respected Old Dick , " Uncle Jesse said . " Old Dick was like a good apple with a few rotten specks in it . He had his faults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chock the wagon when he rested . But the catch was "  --  Uncle Jesse talked on as he wiped rain from his brow  --  " Old Dick just would n't rest on a hill . Dick and Dinah always took their load to the top before they stopped . " " The grave is ready , " Gore said . " Listen to Old Dinah , wo n't you , " I said to Uncle Jesse . " She broke out of the stall twice , " Uncle Jesse said . " Mick and I got ' er back in the barn . She run out to where Old Dick was a-layin ' and sniffled and sniffled and took on something awful ! We 've got ' er in a new stall . I do n't think she can break out now ! " Dinah was braying mournfully . She sounded like a mule crying . If mules could cry I 'd say she was crying . Pa drove the young mules across the little valley to the edge of the pine grove . Then he angled them left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick would be on the upper side of his grave . Then Gore unhitched the log chain from Dick 's legs and Pa drove the mules to one side to let them stand while we rolled Old Dick over into the big hole . We heard Dinah kicking the wall of the barn . Then she stopped braying . " She 's learned that she ca n't get out , " Pa said . " I feel sorryp247for her . She 's lost Old Dick . I do n't know what I 'll ever be able to do with her now ! " We were getting hold of Old Dick 's legs to turn him over into the grave . Old Alec and Gore had his hind legs , and Pa and I had his forelegs . Uncle Jesse could n't do much since Old Dick and Dinah had charged with the wagon and he 'd lost his finger . And then something happened . Old Alec saw her first . Dinah had kicked the heavy planks , nailed with spikes , from the side of the barn , since she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stall because the barn loft was too low for her to leap . But she had kicked her way out and had followed the trail , smelling like a dog , with her nose on the ground . She had come to see Old Dick buried . She did n't bray or cry as long as she could see Old Dick . The young mules , Rock and Rye , turned around and watched too . The three mules stood there silently watching us as we lifted Old Dick 's legs and he rolled over into his last stall . Then Dinah moved up closer and looked in . Uncle Jesse shed more tears . And Pa wiped the rain from his beard with a big red bandanna and he wiped his eyes too . I watched him when he lifted the check lines to drive Rock and Rye to the barn . Old Alec and I shoveled dirt over Old Dick until he was hidden from Dinah 's sight . Then she turned and followed the young mules back to the barn as if she understood.  |p248Grand|pa  was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob of tobacco just set out on the hill across from the house . He looked toward the pasture field where the cows were around the black-oak stumps  --  stumps where Grandpa had cut the trees in a timber job fifteen years ago . " Son , I could tell you a lot , " Grandpa said . " There is not much use , for you will find out . You are young and eager . " Grandpa kept looking toward the tobacco field where the heat glimmered above the soft black-locust and shoe-make loam . Wilted burley plants grew on this hill , deep-rooted in the loam as Grandpa has been deep-rooted in the Kentucky earth . " There 's where I 'd like to be , " Grandpa said . " I 'd like to be there behind that mule . I always did like to raise terbacker . I love the smell of young terbacker . I love to see it standin '  |p249under  the sun in twisted rows around the mountain and a lazy mule easin ' the cutter plow against the stumps . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me . , I do n't like it . " And the vision from the blue-dimmed eyes , from beneath the long frostbitten eyebrows , beheld the faint rays of a setting sun . " I ca n't do much with Pap , " Mom said , for Grandpa was too deaf to hear what she said when she spoke softly . " Pap 's got so he cries because we wo n't let him get out and walk to the wheat fields . He sits out here on the back porch and counts the furrows the Brown boys plow in their terbacker patch over there on the hill . Then he will say , Ca n't turn out no work . Just forty-six furrows around that hill in a half day . That 's not any work . ' " Almost a score of years over his threescore and ten , Grandpa sat on the back porch and looked at the sunlight on the tobacco field . " I 've weighed over two hundred pounds all my life , " he said . " I 'd never been sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was a young man , I did n't know how strong I was . I could lift a barrel of sorghum molasses and drink from the bunghole . But now my people are gone . Pap left the family tree at eighty-seven , Brother Douglas at eightynine , Sister Nance at ninety-two , Sister Salina at eighty-eight , Sister Victoria at eighty-five , and Brother Willison at ninetythree . Brother Douglas would a made the fourscore year and ten all right if it had n't been fer a log rollin ' over him when he burnt the new ground . " I married Violet Pennington , " Grandpa continued , gesturingwith his big hands . " She was a child of April . They named her atter the violets on the hill . I went to housekeepin ' in a one-room shack . We did n't have a bed . We slept on the floor . We just had two quilts . One to go under us , one to go over us . Good thing we got married in May ; we did n't need muchp250kivver then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We et off'n a big goods-box . Did n't have a tablecloth until Violet wove one . She was a pretty woman . She was only thirty-nine when she died . She got her feet wet and took the quick con-sumption . " Grandpa wiped the tears from his blue-dimming eyes with his big fire-shovel hand . " You 've seen her picture , son , in there on that easel that her cousin Riley Pennington painted , " Grandpa said , as he looked toward the heat-glimmer over the wilted tobacco stalks . " She looked a little like your ma . Your ma is about as tall and has the high cheekbones and the coal-black hair your grandma had . That 's the reason I stay with your ma instead of the other children . She looks so much like Violet . Violet was a wife fer a livin ' . I worked ; she saved all I made . We raised seven children . " " I can remember when Pap would n't take an easy job , " Mom said . " He took the hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he cut timber on cold winter days , he 'd go out with his shirt unbuttoned and without a coat , and he never wore socks . He 'd go out on the coldest days when the timber would be frozen and work from daylight until dark . " The hills that stand against these skies are more durable than the oak trees that hide these backbone ridges . Grandpa has battled among them from sun till sun with the ax , cutter plow , maul , crosscut saw , sledge , and wedge . These rugged hills have been salted by the sweat that trickled down his beardy face to the ground . But these hills have kept young while his eagle eyes have grown dim . Grandpa has seen the earth take back his sweat and give him bread in return . " And when Ma died , " Mom said , " I remember what a time we had . For seven years , Pap toiled for us like a brute . I remember how we 'd have fried apples for breakfast , hot bis/cuits and butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd go to get the apples . Mary got married and left the house to me . I had to take care of Brother Jiles , for he was a baby then . A duck laid every morning that spring in the chimney corner and I 'd fry the duck egg for his breakfast . " Grandpa was now looking into space , looking at the tobaccoon the hill , the green rows with the leaves flapping in the wind . Grandpa was chewing tobacco from those hills on his natural teeth , while his youngest daughter , my mother , was trying to keep him from walking to the wheat fields and to Uncle Mel 's house a mile down the hollow . " Now , son , that man over there plowin ' that second mule is a lazy man , " Grandpa said , gesturing with his hand . " I 've watched him day in and day out and I know he wo n't work . Wish I had that hill and could recall ten years . You know , I was runnin ' Pap 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist doctrine . I hated to do it , but he made me do as he said until I was of age , which was twenty-one . It was my legs that got me at eighty-two . If I could just have new legs I 'd be a good man yet . I 'm gettin ' soft and my wind ai n't good , just huff and blow every time I go up a little hill . It 's your ma keepin ' me in . That 's why I 'm soft . I could do more than that fellow over there right now . " There was a time , Grandpa , I thought , when you nearly killed me . You were seventy-five then and I was sixteen . That was when you built this house , and I helped you . You 'd back me up against the hill and I 'd have to saw down a saw log with you without resting . And by the time I had my side of the log scored , you had your side of the log scored and hewed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hewing on the side of the log I had scored . You would get mad and throw the sledge hammer over the hill when the tree pinched the saw . You 'd cool down and make me go and hunt the sledge hammer . When I found it and carried it up the hillp252to you , you seemed pleased . I remember how I tried to keep a row of corn up with you and you nearly killed me . Finally , I had to let you lead me , for the sweat got in my eyes so I could n't see . Even the sweat bees did n't sting me that day . They lit on me , drank all the sweat they wanted , and flew away . What a man you were  --  a mighty mountain of a man . " Pap , it 's time for supper . " Mom spoke loudly so he could hear . " Supper is on the table . " " I 'm not ready fer supper , " Grandpa answered . " You go ahead and eat now if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumble along in the terbacker row . I want to watch that lazy man . Wish I could get between them plow handles and could recall ten years . That would put me back until I 'd just be eighty again . " Mom persuaded Grandpa to leave the porch and go to his supper . " I just want buttermilk and corn bread fer my supper , " Grandpa said . " It 's the grub I was raised on and I still love it . Do n't pour my glass quite full , Mitch . " Grandpa put a thin slice of yellow butter on his hot corn bread . He was ready to eat . " Life is just like a day , " Grandpa continued at the supper table as he ate . " In the mornin ' we are young and we want to get out and turn over hills to see what is under them . Before the long day is over we get tired , just like the sun that rises in the east and comes over to the west  --  comes over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've loved my journey across the sky .

I 've given away in my lifetime . I have come to the end without land or money . I 've wronged no woman , killed no man , stole no chickens . I 've cut as many saw logs and cleaned as much of briers and sprouts and trees as any man in Kentucky . I 've done as muchp253as two ordinary men from the age of sixteen to eighty-four and I 'm not braggin ' . Wish I had new legs ; I 'd show you yet . " The sun had gone down beyond the Seaton hills , dragging a patch of sky with it . From the kitchen window I could see the green tobacco plants between the plowed furrows . I could see them flap their leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sundown sky . I could see the great hills , the trees on their backbones , flanks , and fingers  --  trees with green growing leaves in this new season . I could see the snags of old trees desolate and forlorn ; but around the fertility of their bodies the new stalwart trees had sprung with new leaves in the new spring season.  |p254Eeryone  wondered what would happen as Mom , Pa , Brother Tim , and I walked into church . Because Pa was on trial . All eyes turned toward us . We could n't sit too far away from the other members of the congregation because our church building was a house . Our Church of the Old Faith was in the largest house in Blakesburg . When the house had been put on skids and moved out of the way for a new street , the elders in our church saw a bargain and bought it for a church because there was plenty of room upstairs for our moderator , Egbert Chanute , and his nine children . There was enough space downstairs , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship . The house had fourteen spires . Two old people had once lived in its twenty-seven rooms with twenty-seven cats . Some said the house was haunted and the spirit of a witch was in each cat . They were afraid to go near this house . But whenp255Moderator Chanute , who was holding services in the homes of the members of our church , heard the house was for sale , he said if there were evil spirits in the house , he had what it would take to make them leave . Now , because our church had a lot of strict rules , my father was on trial . That was the reason all eyes were turned toward us . Even Moderator Chanute , a big man with bushy eyebrows and deep-socketed black eyes that shone like balls of fire , watched us as Pa found seats as far away from the pulpit as he could . Pa had n't done as bad things as some members had done . Pa had n't attended a circus . He had n't gone to a movie . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or chewed the fragrant weed and drank the violent water . Pa had n't even read the funny papers . He had tried to go straight according to the doctrine of our church , the policies our moderator had laid down to his members . Pa would have gone straight if it had n't been for one thing . Percy Cadden , a short fat redheaded man who smoked big cigars , had brought television to Blakesburg . He had built a store and he installed the sets . He put them in people 's homes just for trial . If the family liked television , then the set remained . And I have my first time ever to know of a television set being taken out of any home where Percy installed it . That 's where Pa had made the mistake . Nobody in our house liked television more than Pa . He would laugh , slap his knees with his big hands , and twist in his chair , holler and laugh more than Mom , Brother Tim , or I as he watched a baseball game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programthat came on . I never saw anybody enjoy anything more than Pa enjoyed his television . He could n't wait to finish his work at the store and check his cash register to get home to his television . " This is a serious moment in our lives , " Moderator Chanute announced after we were all seated . " ' When we pray , I **25;11165;TOOLONG emphasis , " My office at the Court of Wards is gone . I am nearly certain of it . " " Good God , John ! " Emmanuel started back , staring . " What does that mean ? " Winthrop 's thin shoulders sketched a shrug . " Doubtless that in some mysterious way I have come under unfavorable notice from  --  " He lifted his hand in the direction of Whitehall , then let it drop . " ' T is yet another straw in the wind , " said Sir Richard Saltonstallheavily . " My dear sir , my deepest sympathies . You will then retire to your estates in Suffolk , I suppose ? " " My estates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for , and one of them  --  " He stopped . " But my familyafflictions have no bearing on the matter in hand . " " We must move fast , " said Cradock , leaning forward and speaking low . " Everything points to that . Fast and  --  and cautiously . Or we may be hindered . " " Come to Lincolnshire ! " burst out Isaac Johnson . " My noble brother has authorized me to ask you . There at Sempringham we may all confer in utmost secrecy . Lord Lincoln yearns to be of help in establishing a new kingdom to God 's glory and the Church 's good ! " Again Cradock glanced at the faces around the table , until his eyes rested on Winthrop , noting that the others unconsciously did the same . The man had strength and a powerful attraction , for all his brooding gravity . " You will go to Lincolnshire , Mr. Win-throp ? " John exchanged a look with Emmanuel , and slowly nodded . " Mr. Downing and I will be pleased to confer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , but you 'll go over there too  --  to the new land with us , sir , wo n't you ? " cried Isaac . " I saw your eye kindle when I spoke of it ! " " I 've given the matter insufficient thought , " said Winthrop after a moment . " It seems unlikely , but it is a decision only God can make . " They all bowed their heads , and Sir Richard said , " Amen . " For the ensuing hour , they arranged matters preliminary to the Lincolnshire conference . They made lists of possible financial backers , and lists of the few men amongst these whom they felt it safe to sound out at this time . Robert Feake was one , and a message was dispatched to him . It was Emmanuel Downing and Cradock , both shrewd merchants and men of substance them/selves , who led in this discussion , and though Winthrop listened and contributed at times , he also fell into long abstractions . In his heart was a great question , and his thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshaled nor quieted . At Groton Manor during May and June , despite lovely weather , an unhappy restlessness prevailed . Margaret and Elizabeth were drawn close by their mutual cares , for neither was sure of her own husband 's intention , and each letter from London added to the uncertainties . harry too was in London , though out of touch with his father , and all Margaret 's dutiful efforts to keep her stepson on the Manor had failed . So had Elizabeth 's . In the long June evening of the 29th , the women sat together in the walled garden by the mulberry tree and watched the Manor road for Bluet , the servant , who had been sent as usual to meet the London carrier in case there should be letters . For some days he had brought none . Margaret 's little boys were in bed , Forth , Harry 's younger brother , had ridden to Cambridge to give up his chambers there , for he was no longer inclined towards the ministry . Mary Winthrop was visiting her Aunt Gostlin in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this rarity moved them both to more frankness than usual . Margaret sat on a bench sewing a pair of linen drawers for her youngest , but Elizabeth sprawled on the grass idly combing the thick turf for four-leaf clovers . The last rays of mellow sunlight gilded her rich dark hair and pretty downcast face . The older woman said gently , " Will you read us a psalm while we wait , Bess ? ' T is always better not to mope in idleness . " The girl sat up and cried passionately , " I can understand that he has merry times in London , with Thanet and Seaton no doubt and with  --  " she bit her lips thinking of all the Chloes and Sylvias with which London abounded , " but he does love me in his way . I know that ! Why does he not write ! " Margaret sighed thinking of a sentence in her John 's last letter . Henry is in London , but I have seen him but twice , I know not what he cloth nor what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he will soone bring upon himself and his wife . Yet she tried to comfort . " Harry was never one for letters , dear , and is naturally busy arrangingyour voyage to Barbadoes . " Her own voice faltered , andp102the girl said with quick bitter sympathy , " Aye , Mother  --  ' t is of a different voyage you think , is n't it ! " Margaret put down her sewing . " I can not think John means to go . . . " she said half to herself . " Not to that wilderness of wild beasts and savages where so many have perished . To leave me and the children behind  --  to leave this  --  " She opened her eyes and looked at the rosy gables behind them , at the great sheltering roof , the smoking chimneys of the Manor House . She looked at the little walled garden with its sweet trim roses , gillyflowers and lilies she tended herself . Both women were silent while the church bell chimed the hour gently across the meadows , and the doves cooing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'm weak , " Margaret whispered . " This shrinking savors too much of the flesh . John has said so . He told me that it would be a great service to the Church to carry Gospel to that other land and raise a bulwark against the kingdom of anti-Christ which the Jesuits labor to rear in all parts of the world . He told me that the land here in England groaneth under her inhabitants , and there is so much deceit and unrighteousness that it is almost impossible for a good man to maintain his estates and live comfortably in his profession . He is right , ever right , and I will always submit to his wishes . " She bent her head . Elizabeth had not been listening ; her thoughts had flown to Harry , praying that he were indeed hastening their own voyage to Barbadoes or anywhere that he would stay with her , yet something in Margaret 's speech caught her laggard attention and she said slowly , " Do you know why Father Winthrop lost his office at the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Margaret shook her head . " John knows not how it was , but somehow the Winthrop name would seem to have vexed the King himself . These are dreadful times . " Elizabeth thought of that far-off happy day on the Thames , of their meeting with the royal barge and the King 's questions , and was stricken with guilt . But of what use to mention it ? The damagewas done , if indeed it were her fault , and the memory of that clay was filled with nostalgic pain . She touched the gaudy gilt and crystal brooch Harry had given her , as though it were a talisman . He does love me , she thought . I must be patient , but while she thought this , deep down a hot rebellion stirred . She grabbed up a handful of grass and threw it violently at the mulberry trunk . " Why was I not born a man ? " she cried . " Why ca n't I enjoy myself in London too ? Why must I sit here waiting , wondering  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Hush , dear , " cried Margaret , momentarily dismayed . " You must n't question God 's provision for you , or your lot as a wife . You will settle to it better , when the babes start coming . " " Ah . . . " said Elizabeth glumly . There had been no shameful result from that night in St. James 's Park . Had I known for sure of that , she thought  --  would I  --  ? And at once chided herself . It was not because of that she had married Harry ; they loved each other , and also John Winthrop had made them marry . That there was some contradiction in these thoughts she saw dimly , and suddenlybegan to cry . " Poor child , " said Margaret patting her on the shoulder . " Oh , look , Bess , there 's Bluet coming and he has letters in his hand ! " The girl dashed her apron across her eyes and sprang down the lane . There was a note from Harry , terse and misspelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . They would all be arriving at Groton next week , and Winthrop said he was bringing Priscilla Fones , Sammy and Martha too . " Harry is coming , and oh , how glad I am that Martha comes too at last ! " Elizabeth cried , laughing huskily when they had read the letters . Margaret nodded . " You see , Bess , how God is good and kind , always , if we be patient . "  |p103INAUGUST  John Winthrop and Emmanuel Downing rode to Lincolnshire and visited Theophilus Fiennes Clinton , the young Earl of Lincoln , at Sempringham . There in the great mansion which had been recently erected on the site of the once famous Gilbertine Priory , John Winthrop definitely made up his mind for the adventure overseas . He found himself in the company of an earnest charming family , all of whom were dedicated to the glorious enterprise and had thought of little else for two years . The Earl , because of his responsibilities and vast estates , could not emigrate , nor of course could his Countess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Say , and as enthusiastic as her husband in furthering the new plantation . The Earl 's three sisters had each married men to whom the colonization of a new and freer England was of paramount importance . The Lady Frances and her husband , John Gorges , were not present at this meeting in Sempringham , but the Lady Susan , with her husband , John Humphrey , and the fair Lady Arbella were anxiously awaitingdiscussion of the great project . Arbella 's husband , Isaac Johnson , was even more fervent than he had been in London and  --  it soon developed  --  he was prepared to invest a very large sum in the Massachusetts Bay Colony as well . On the second night after his arrival John Winthrop sat well up the board at the Earl 's huge dining table , and having eaten superbly and drunk three silver gobletfuls of excellent claret , he leaned back in his chair content as he had ever been in his life . Amongst the score of diners there had been much inspiring talk , after a beautiful prayer offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Church in nearby Boston . Long ago Cottonhad been at Trinity College when John himself was there and he found that the lanky young Cotton had developed into a manp105of magnetic power , whose long fluffy white hair , flashing dark eyes and bell-like voice combined to move his hearers mightily . An Ezekiel himself , Cotton seemed , when he had quoted that prophet in heartbroken tones : Son of man thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house , which have eyes to see and see not . . . therefore thou son of man prepare thee stuff for removing , and remove by day in their sight .. . When he finished his prayer , tears had flowed from Lady Arbella 's eyes , and John himself swallowed a lump in his throat . There were two other clergymen at Sempringham that night ; Roger Williams , a young firebrand with ginger hair , pronounced liberal opinions on everything , and a quick pleasing smile . Also Thomas Hooker , a placid middle-aged vicar from Chelmsford , who spoke very little but watched the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had brought with him from Boston . They were a couple called Hutchinson , a weedy little merchant of obvious means , and his tall vibrant wife , whose brilliantgray eyes rested admiringly now on the Earl , now on the Reverend Cotton . No doubt she was in awe of the people she found herself amongst , Winthrop thought quite wrongly , not hearing her occasional decisive remarks , nor knowing that Mistress Anne Hutchinson was in awe of nobody . But John , beneath his polite smile , was intent on his own problems . For weeks he had been uncertain of his course . he had written page after page of argument pro and con the new plantation in endeavor to clarify his own mind , and he had waited on God 's sure direction , aware of the pitfall of vanity . For it had been most agreeable to feel that his participation in the infant company was so much wanted and by such exalted men . Nor was this for the money lie might invest in the venture ; he had made clear his financial embarrassments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leadership , administration and integrity they so flatteringly imputedto him , and during this dinner his uncertainty ceased . The Earl suddenly leaned down the table and said earnestly , " Well , Mr. Winthrop , may we hope that you are definitely joining the company and will go to New England ? " John bowed his head and answered solemnly , " Aye , my lord , I will . " The Lady Arbella clapped her slender hands , Isaac , her husband ,  |p106laughed  with relief , Sir Richard Saltonstall cried , " Splendid ! " and was echoed by most of the others around the table except Downingwho gave a dismayed grunt , for he had decided that though he would venture an investment , he would not himself emigrate at present . " It 'll be hard , John , " he said below his breath . " You 're fortyone , used to gentle living , and not so hale  --  " John did not hear him , for the Earl was speaking again . " And to what , Mr. Winthrop , do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm shining smile which was like Arbella 's . John hesitated ; he might have referred to Cotton 's prayer , or to the glow of fellowship and dedication he had found at Sempringham , but he instinctively substituted a Sign . " On my way here , my lord , as we crossed the fens , my horse fell in a bog , and I in the water . I 'd have been drowned , had not God preserved me for a manifest purpose , and thus made known to me His Will . " They all nodded understanding and Cotton said resonantly , " Praised be His Mercy ! " The Earl glanced down his great candlelit dining table , at his sisters and their husbands , at the three ministers , at Cotton 's forceful follower  --  Mrs. Hutchinson . He looked at William Coddington , a substantial Boston merchant who was anxious to emigrate , perhaps not entirely for religious reasons , the Earl thought . There would be self-interest , the acquisition of land , particularly , to influence many of the venturers , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they rested on his old steward , Thomas Dudley . Dudley was a red-faced truculent man of fifty-three who intended to emigrate , as did his seventeen-year-old daughter , the dreamy Anne , who sat beside her husband , young Simon Bradstreet . Both Dudley and Bradstreet were members of Lincoln 's own household and eminently efficient men . The Earl glanced at Sir Richard Saltonstall . He then thought of the other directors of the Company who were known to him and not present ; and particularly of the Governor , Matthew Cradock , who had remained in London but had sent the Earl certain advisements by letter , " in case Mr. Winthrop should find himself persuaded ... " This will go hard with Dudley , thought the Earl , but I had better give some warning . He motioned the footmen to refill the goblets and rose to propose a toast " To John Winthrop , Esquire , who has joined our great enterprise , " he paused , " and whom I believe we may see become the temporal leader of it in the New World ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thin cheeks . Now what does he mean by that ? he thought in confusion . Surely not the governorship ! A leap of excitement was balanced by dismay . As he made some vague mechanical response , he receivedimpressions from the faces at the table . Some looked surprisedor uncertain , some like Isaac Johnson looked pleased , but there was no mistaking Thomas Dudley 's reaction . His big hairy hand clenched on the goblet , while he choked on a mouthful of wine . His jowls quivered , and though he said nothing , Dudley sent Lord Lincoln a glare of indignation . Surely there was no doubt that I 'd be made Governor ! Dudley thought , since Cradock wo n't emigrate . He stared down trembling at his dish of sugared figs , while blood drummed in his head . Who was this new-come pettifogging attorney anyway ! An attorney who had lost his job , and admittedly most of his lands as well . A country squire whose grandfather had been a clothier . While I  --  thought Dudley burning with injustice  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noblemen  --  Lord Northampton , Lord Say  --  and my long services to this ingrate , the Earl of Lincoln ! The Earl had been bankrupt when Dudley took over the stewardshipof the estates , and in twenty years had managed them so well that now the Earl was solvent . Who better qualified than Dudley to administer a new colony ? And besides there were the rights of birth and seniority . I 'd not have agreed to go if I 'd had wind of this , he thought , which brought an unpleasant corollary . For the Earl had urged his going , and Dudley 's work at Sempringham , Tattershall , Folkingham , Lincoln , and a dozen smaller properties was done . The Earl had no further need of him , nor even of his son-in-law , Simon Bradstreet . Dudley looked up suddenly to see that his daughter Anne was staring at him . In her lightly pockmarkedface the big eyes shone with concealed anxiety . At once he softened . Never mind , darling , he thought , your old father 'll be Governor yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Earls , or Bishops , or  --  his wrinkled lids raised to stare at Winthrop 's flushed uncomfortable face . What do they SEE in him ? thought Dudley . They ca n't make this Suffolk squirelet Governor ! Yet John Winthrop was elected Governor of the Massachusetts Company in London on October 20 , 1629 , and after long delay Dudley was named Deputy . Like it or not he must go second to the new land . Dudley did not like it but by then he had cooled off , and also been won to grudging acceptance of Winthrop 's indisputablesincerity and energy  --  so he bided his time . Dudley had seen Winthrop 's qualities best exhibited on the 26thp108of August , when they had all left Sempringham and foregathered in Cambridge , with the other members of the Company who were going to emigrate . There Winthrop had behaved himself with intelligence and foresight , collaborating so wholeheartedly with Dudley in the draft of the " Agreement " proclaiming the venturers right to take their charter with them that Dudley could find no fault with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winthrop . It was while his father was in Cambridge , signing the historic agreement , that John Winthrop , Junior , came home to Groton , thereby greatly disturbing Elizabeth 's hard-won peace of mind . He had arrived in London from Venice via Amsterdam on August 13 , he had exchanged letters with his father and with Margaret , he had announced himself as delighted with the Massachusetts project , and ready to co-operate in all things with his father 's wishes . So Elizabeth had been prepared , and thought herself fortified , yet when he dismounted at the door of the Manor on that late August afternoon she discovered that she was not . Led by Margaret , the whole family rushed out to meet him except Harry who had profited by his father 's absence to pelt off to London , but when Elizabeth saw the sturdy green-cloaked figure , the long-nosed merry face tanned by sea voyaging , the brown hair , the alert eyes misted now by the emotion of homecoming  --  she drew back behind Martha , and clung to the door frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cry of welcome , and flinging her arms around his neck , burst into tears . " Jack , Jack  --  we thought you 'd never come ! " cried the girl , clinging to him , " and I thought you 'd been gobbled up by monsters ! " " Not a single monster did I see , Mattie , " Jack answered , laughing and kissing her on the top of the head , " But I 'm glad to be home . " He gently disengaged the girl and kissed all his relatives  --  Margaret ; his quiet plain sister Mary , who was also weeping ; his brother Forth , " So you 've grown into a man , youngster ! Are you still for the ministry ? " Forth shook his head , and Jack with a nod said , " You must tell me of it later , d' you know I 've not had one letter these fourteen months since I left home until I got back to London ! " He embraced his four wriggling little half-brothers , Stephen , Adam , Deane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still stood in the shadow of the doorway . " Ah , there you are , Bess , " he said , his voice changing slightly . " I wasp109indeed astonished to return and find that you had become my sister ! " " Yes , " she said through a tight throat . " It was  --  was sudden . " She forced herself to walk towards him , and offered him her cheek , but she could not smile . Nor did he . His eyes had grown stern as his father 's and he turned away from her abruptly to enter the Hall , where Margaret and Martha and Mary fluttered over him , stuffing him with all the delicacies they had been saving for this occasion . Elizabeth sat silent in a corner while Jack ate and answered questions and told them some of his adventures , though " Truly , " he said smiling , " I 've become sated with such diversity of countries , and find little difference when it comes to journey 's end . " Elizabeth thought , That does n't sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new sights . And Margaret said with hesitance , for the subject upset her , " Yet , dear Jack , I know you 've told your father that you would go with him to that dreadful  --  to that new plantation on the other side of the world . " Her voice dropped . " He was much heartened , " Jack looked at her with sympathy , and answered gently , " I had much time for thought on my voyage , and I know that I 'll always call that my country where I can best glorify God and enjoy the presence of those I love . I 've read my father 's Conclusions for the departure , and I think them unanswerable , and that it ca n't but be a prosperous action . You 'll come to feel so too , my mother . " Margaret sighed and put her arms around his shoulders . " I pray so , " she whispered , thinking with a fearing pang of the new life which had started in her womb . John did not know yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . " You saw Harry in town ? " she asked quickly , glancing at Elizabethwho looked both unusually lovely and very somber as she sat turned from them , staring out the window , though she lifted her head at Margaret 's question . " No , " answered Jack shortly . " Though I heard he was there , staying with friends . " That was not all he had heard from his Aunt Lucy . There had been a detailed account of Harry 's misbehaviorin general , and of Elizabeth 's . And for some reason not quite clear to him , Jack had made no effort to find his brother and tell him he was home . Elizabeth spoke defensively . " Harry will be here on Tuesday or Wednesday , he has written me so . He had much to do about our voyage to Barbadoes . " She glanced at Jack and then away.  | " Oh , and Harry has such grand friends in town , " cried Martha . " The Earl of Thanet and  --  and others . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha who was looking up at him with open admiration in her large brown eyes . Her cheeks were flushed and her babyish mouth was parted , for the short upperlip seldom covered her rather prominent front teeth . She was a small girl , but in the time he had been gone her figure had rounded and her soft chestnut hair was neatly coiled at the back of her head instead of loosely flowing as it had been . " You 've grown up , little one , " said Jack , " and become very pretty , upon my word ! " Martha blushed and her eyes sparkled . " I 'm eighteen , " she said proudly , but a knife turned in Elizabeth 's chest . Does he know he said that to ME , scarce over a year ago , she thought , while reason battled with the pain . It was Jack 's way to speak pleasantly , and he was devoted to all his family , and in any case what differencedid it make if he admired Martha ! " Jack  --  " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mulberries are ripe , the old tree 's loaded with them . D' you remember how you used to love them ? Do come and see ! " Martha put her hand shyly on his arm , then dropped it in confusion . " I mean if you want to . " " Of course I do ! You shall show me every single thing on the Manor . " He stood up , the little boys prancing ahead of him to the door . " You come too , Bess , " cried Martha . Elizabeth shook her head . " I 've work to do . " She glanced at Mary and Margaret who were supervising the servants as they cleared the table which had been set with earthenware and some silver in Jack 's honor . She saw that the kindhearted Margaret was about to send her off with the others and said stiffly , " I 've much linen to sort . " Margaret sent her a troubled appraising look , while Martha , Jack and the boys went out into the garden . Elizabeth stood a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha pop a mulberry into Jack 's mouth and heard the girl 's soft timid laugh , which held for the first time a note of coquetry that Elizabeth knew to be unconscious . She quitted the Hall , and walked across the innercourt to the other side of the great house , but she did not go to the linen room ; she went to a small chamber near the dairy , that Margaret had allotted to her . It was a combination stillroom and surgery . Elizabeth had herself fitted it for the brewing of simples and cordials , and for the treatment of small injuries amongst thep111servants and tenants , or ailments for which it seemed foolish to summon the doctor at Boxford . Elizabeth found this work congenial , as many household duties were not ; it filled the days that l Larry was away , and she took pride in her knowledge of drugs , and iu the trust which Groton inhabitants were beginning to have in her remedies and diagnoses . This afternoon she glanced at the crocks where herb vinegars were infusing , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she touched neither . She sat clown on a stool and stared at the scrubbed brick floor until the light died and the cows in the byre across the meadow bawled to be milked . It was in the same place , the following afternoon , that Jack found her . One of the kitchen maids had burned herself on the soup kettle . Elizabeth was binding a poultice of yellow calendula salve over the blisters and did not at first see Jack who stood in the open doorway watching . And thinking how beautiful she was in her black silk morning robes and white apron , they gave added transparency to her vivid coloring and luster to her long , intent hazel eyes . When the kitchen maid had departed with bobbing curtseys , he walked into the surgery and said , " Bess , we 've been avoiding each other , it 's best to have it out . " She started , and stiffened . " There 's naught to have out , " she said faintly , stacking the pile of old linen rags she used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fired the still where she was preparing her father 's mithridate . " I 'm wed to Harry . I love him passionately . There 's no more to say . . . nor , " she added in spite of herself , " did I ever receive any word from you , though you promised . " Jack glanced at her averted face . Mechanically he fingered a bunch of drying thyme which hung with other herbs from a pole . " I myself received no letters from home all the time I was gone , so I might tell you that I had written you and it miscarried . But I did not write . Yet I thought of you often and I thought that you would  --  " he stopped sharply . What nonsense , that he had been about to add the word " wait . " Had he thought any such thing at all ? Had he not in fact nearly succeeded by use of his strong emotional control in forgetting that disturbing scene in the apothecary 's garden before he sailed ? There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went on with considerable coldness , " Bess , you behaved abominably to my friend Edward Howes . I fear he still loves you . I have just seen much of him at the Downings ' and he is very bitter  --  justifiablyso. "  | " Ah , " she said turning around at last , with a green spark in her eyes . " I 'm sorry for that . Aye , you urged me to marry him , did you not ! " His hand clenched on the thyme which floated in powdery shreds to the floor . " I thought you 'd make each other happy , I  --  Harry 's my brother but  --  I doubt that he  --  I never thought that you  --  " " The milk is shed , " said Elizabeth tartly . " ' T is useless now to water it . " They stood and stared at each other , both in varying degrees , now aware what their anger hid . Bubblings in the retort over the fire , and the hiss of the burning charcoal alone broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aye , you 're right . I yammerlike a weanling . But , Bess , we 've become brother and sister , can we not also be friends as we used to be ? " His face broke into its warm smile . I doubt it , she thought , but she bowed her head and murmured acquiescence , while conjuring up with all her strength the image of Harry . His handsome blond head that would have grazed the ceiling , his swagger and grace , his knowing hands and lips for which her body yearned each night . And she thought of something else , which would seal the barrier between herself and jack for all time . She added a handful of rue to the simmering mithridateand said , " I have but lately known that I am with child . " Jack hid from himself a twist of distaste , and said lightly , " What excellent news ! The first Winthrop grandchild . Now surely that will steady Harry 's character ! " And mine , I hope , she thought . They talked then of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested . He examined her father 's book of receipts and Gerard 's invaluable Herbal . He had a quick scientific mind and made several suggestionsfor improving her equipment  --  a different shape retort  --  new steel lancets for bloodletting such as he had seen in Holland . He helped her untwist and clean the coils in her still , and their hands touched by accident once . They both drew back quickly but as he continued refitting the still he could not help glancing at her hands . They were not small , the palms were square and capable , but the long fingers ended in polished rosy nails and the skin looked like white velvet . Elizabeth took great care of her hands because Harry admired them . Indeed he often expressed pleasure in all her bodily charms , which did not , however , suffice to keep him from London , she thought bitterly  --  and when I am swollen with child .. .  |p113Jack  saw her face set , and the cloud in her expressive eyes . Once he would have tried to cheer her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it brought annoyance . This is ridiculous , he thought , and will surely pass . I 'll not allow this  --  this chimera to cloud my homecoming . " How glad I shall be to see my father , " he said brightly , " and to learn more of this tremendous move , on which if it be God 's will we shall embark . " " Aye , " she said , removing her apron and hanging it on a peg , " And I 'll be glad when we leave for Barbadoes . Harry has told me of its beauties . " And glad to be away from here . Alone with Harry there would be no memories , and no Jack . " Do you pray sometimes when you 're alone , Bess ? " he said suddenly . " Oh , I 've not the piety of my good parents , I fear , nor am I sure of my salvation as I might be  --  yet I know that God listens when we beseech his love and kindness , and He helps us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " She looked up at him and smiled a little , but she did not answer . Even to Jack she dared not admit how prayers and sermons bored her , and that in the fastness of her heart there was a void of disbelief , or rather a secret certainty that there was nothing in the world or out of it to sustain her but herself . It had been thus since the day her uncle flogged her here at Groton Manor . The autumn passed quickly in a constant bustle of preparations , letter writings , interviews with prospective emigrants , and strange visitors at all hours . From the moment of John Winthrop 's returnand even when he made quick trips to London , the entire manor was imbued by his fervor and his three older sons were all pressed into service . Jack was his father 's able lieutenant and coped with much of the business matters besides acting as magistratein the local court at Groton Hall . Forth transcribed dozens of letters at Winthrop 's dictation , and Harry 's wanderings were summarily curtailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative to the Great Migration , he was allotted the supervision of the manor work . This at least gave him fresh air and the enjoyment of riding and shooting with his greyhounds , while he visited the various tenants , collected Michaelmas rents , inspected winter pasturage , and the condition of the stock , oversawthe threshers , the garnering of fruit and nut crops , and the cutting of wood logs for winter fuel . Harry was subdued and compliant during those months ; Jack 's presence always had a sobering effect on him , and there had beenp114a painful scene with his father and brother combined , when he had had to confess the inadequacies of his arrangements for return to Barbadoes , which was moreover being bombarded by the Spaniards . " That settles the matter , " said Winthrop with exasperated finality . " We will efface the whole Barbadoes venture , where you were apparently swayed by vicious company , and I shall endeavor not to remind you how disappointing and costly it has been . You will come to New England with me where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have ample opportunity to serve God and your family . " " What about Bess , sir ? " said Harry glumly , accepting the decisionas inevitable . And in truth his London life had ceased to be amusing . Thanet was married , Seaton had gone to Papist Ireland , other acquaintances were cool towards a youth without money . " Elizabeth  --  " said Winthrop , sighing . Since learning of her pregnancy he had come to feel more kindly towards her , and sorrowfor his second son 's obvious deficiencies as a responsible husband . He picked up his pen and addressed a letter to " The Rev. Mr. George Phillips , Boxted , Essex " before he went on . " Elizabeth will wait here at the Manor with my wife , until it is sold . Since they are both with child , it is better thus anyway . John will look after them , and see to the Manor sale . When that is concluded he will bring them over , but you will come with me . " He sighed again , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to his letter which was an urgent invitation for Mr. Phillips , vicar of Boxted , to join the Massachusetts Company and sail with them in March . " I pray that this Phillips will be moved to come with us , and that the good reports I 've heard of him are true , " Winthrop said to Jack who was copying lists of necessities to give the prospectivePlanters . " It would be unthinkable to sail without a Man of God amongst us . " " I thought Mr. Wilson had consented to go , " observed Jack , who had found the scene with Harry painful though he entirely agreed with his father . " Aye , I believe Mr. Wilson will go , but not as soon as we . His wife holds back and his parish is loath to part with him . " I wonder at that ! Jack thought with an inward laugh . He did not share his father 's admiration for John Wilson , the rector of Sudbury , who was a fat pompous man without a gleam of lightness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smell out the slightest want of zeal in his flock . Jack was aware that he was thinking of Mr. Wilson so as not to think of Bess , andp115the dismay she would feel when she heard the new plan for Harry . There were many times when he avoided thinking of Bess . Still , now that Harry was home it was usually easier . Martha too made it easier . He had become fond of her trusting innocence , her dependenceon him , and one could not help but be flattered by the adoration in her eyes . When Harry told Elizabeth of his father 's ultimatum , she was indeed dismayed . She had been lying in their great carved fourposterlistlessly watching the bare elm branches writhing against the dun December sky , while the sleet hissed on the windowpanes . I Ier condition bothered her very little , but she had moments of queasiness . Harry burst into their room , kicked angrily at the log fire , and went to fish in the cupboard for a jug of brandy he kept hidden there . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , said , " We 're not going to Barbadoes . We 're going to Massachusettsinstead . " She made a quivering sound and stared up at him . He told her what his father had said , and when he finished she turned her face into the pillows and began to cry . " Do n't Bess  --  do n't , love  --  " cried Harry , much moved . He had never seen her cry before , except at her father 's funeral . " I do n't like it either , or leaving you at such a time . But I have no say , you know that . It ca n't be so long until you come with our babe , and Brother John 'll look after you . " At this she cried harder , and he lifted her up in his arms , kissed her wet cheeks and her mouth , and settled her head on his shoulder . " Here , have a swig . " He held the jug to her lips and she swallowed . " Breeding ever makes women upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having begotten a child , the first of the new generation , and certain it would be a son . Once in Massachusetts he could get a land grant far larger than on Barbadoes , and no plaguey tobacco to struggle with either . There 'd be game to hunt , forests , Indians , adventure and freedom . He had no doubt that he could avoid his father 's watchfulness after landing . " You 'll like the New England , darling , I know you will . " He kissed her again with enthusiasm . " Must we always do as HE says ? " Elizabeth cried , yet yielding to his arms . " You 're of age , Harry . " " But I 've no money , or property left , " he answered cheerfully . " You know that . There 'll be a fine chance to get both in a new land . " You did n't in Barbadoes , she thought . " There 's my four-hundred-pounddowry , " she faltered . Both she and Martha had in/herited this sum from Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Harry shook his head with regret . " Father has it , nor will he let me touch it . " He did not add that his father had been forced to spend much of this sum in settling Harry 's debts . " He feels that he provides for all your needs here , and will for mine if I do as he says . There 's no help for it , sweetheart . " He slipped his hand on her breast beneath her bodice , and began to kiss her neck . " No more tears , " he said . " There are far better things to do . " He unpinned the brooch he had given her , and untied the lacings at her waist . She started to push him away , but her hand instead began to stroke his thick blond hair , drawing his head close against her breasts . " Harry , Harry  --  " she whispered falling back on the pillows . " When we are like this , together , I forget everything but you  --  " He laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abandoningherself to pleasure so keen that it was indistinguishable from love . They were aroused some time later by a timid knock on the door . Harry cursed and shouted out a sleepy " Who 's there ! " to be answeredby an indistinct murmur . " ' T is Sally , " sighed Elizabeth . She pulled herself from the bed and wrapped the satin coverlet around her nakedness . She unbolted the door , knowing that her little maid would never disturbthem except for real cause . " What is it , Sal ? " she asked through the crack . Sally was a buxom Suffolk lass of sixteen with squint-eyes and pimples . She bobbed a curtsey and said , " Beg pardon , ma'am , but Marster Winthrop he 's a-waiting to star-rt the prayings , an ' he sent me tew fetch ye . " " Oh , to be sure  --  " said Elizabeth blushing . She noted that Sally held a candle . It had grown late while they dallied together and dozed . " We 'll be down directly , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oi 've a message fur Marster Harry special . It come from Boxford some hours agone , from the Fleece , it dew . " " What 's that ? " cried Harry sitting up . " Bring me the message , Bess ! " " ' T is not wrote , sir  --  " said Sally , she twisted one red chilblainedhand in her apron , and glanced nervously over her shoulder down the long shadowy corridor . " A wee lad come privily to me to say thot the Egyptian 's in bad trouble , will ye tew the Fleece and help him , sir ! " " Blast and damnation  --  " muttered Harry below his breath , while Elizabeth thought , Can it be Peyto ? though Harry saidp117he 'd left him in London . " What sort of trouble , Sally , do you know ? " she asked the girl who nodded and shivered . ' They be saying in Boxfor-rd , that he 's a witch ! " She gasped , putting her hand over her mouth , and scuttled away towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Is it Peyto , Harry ? " He grunted , and she went on , frowning , " But I thought you got rid of him long ago . You promised your father  --  " " Can I help it if the scamp is devoted to me ? If he got a job in the stables at the Fleece to be near me ! Good Lord , Bess , he risked his life for me in Barbadoes . " " You 've been seeing him then ? " He shrugged . " Now and then . He 's done me some good turns . " Ah , she thought , sighing  --  that 's where the brandy comes from . " What will you do , Harry ? " " Go to the Fleece and see what this all means . Hurry up , sweet , there 'll be enough trouble without our being late to prayers ! " They dressed hastily and went to the parlor . John Winthrop absently accepted their excuses and did not give the prayers and psalms his usual impressive emphasis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night he dismissed the servants and younger children and addressed the others . " There 's been called to my attention a matter of such grave concern , that occupied though I am with preparations for departure , I feel it must be dealt with . " They all looked at him anxiously except Jack who had been with his father when the angry delegation of townsfolk from Boxfordstamped through the sleet into the Manor . Winthrop continuedfrowning . " The Landlord of the Fleece , Constable Cole , Mr. Doggett and Goodman Biggs , all waited on me here this afternoon to prefer a charge of witchcraft against  --  " he paused and looked at Harry , " a fellow recently hired as ostler at the Fleece . " " Witchcraft ! " cried Margaret , her round face paling . " Oh , John , how terrible ! " " I do n't understand , sir , " said Forth in his rather pedantic way . " Why did they come to you if the alleged witch or warlock is at Boxford ? Why did they not take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not their squire ? " " They came here , " answered his father , " because this knave is known to have been in the service of a member of my family . He is , in fact , Peyto , that disreputable gypsy churl I repeatedly told you to dismiss , Henry , and whom you assured me you had . " " I did , sir , " said Harry quickly . " Had you any knowledge of his presence now so near us at Box/ford ? " Winthrop 's eyes flashed with anger born of distress . There had been no witchcraft , no such hint of the Devil 's presence in this part of Suffolk for years , and the delegation had heatedly assured him that it was being taken as a sign of God 's wrath and divine opposition to Winthrop 's plans for leaving home . Mr. Doggett had even said that local men who had signed agreement for New England and guaranteed passage money were withdrawing their names . " Answer me , Henry ! " cried Winthrop in a thunderous voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Boxford ? " " No , sir , " said Harry looking his father straight in the eye . His lie sprang not entirely from cowardice though he was afraid , but from loyalty to Peyto whom he thought he might help more easily if their recent connection was unknown . Jack raised his eyebrowsto give his brother a sad speculative glance , but Winthrop accepted the statement with relief . " What do they say Peyto has done , sir ? " asked Harry in a small voice . Winthrop pulled a sheet of paper from his pocket , and scanned the arraignment Doggett had written for the aroused townsfolk to make their marks on . He then read the gist of it aloud. " 1 . He is admittedly an Egyptian , and all such are known for evil practices , the landlord hired him unaware , thought him Welsh or Cornish , having never seen natives of those places. 2 . Ile is given to secret sorcery and divination by means ofSatan 's own tool , some strange-pictured playing cards. 3 . He has a familiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange language , and the donkey has been heardto answer him. 4 . Since he came , there have been many marvelous disasters . Six cows died along Stone Street where he was seen to ride his donkey , then Robert Reynolds , the cordwainer 's entire shoe shop was burned last Sabbath day . At the Fleece , they have heard strange noises in the night , particularlythe ringing of the chamber bells in the courtyard , from rooms known to be vacant . This has so frightened travelers , that the Landlord is losing his custom . Worst of all , when Goody Biggs began to suspect him by reason of her horse running away out of the Inn courtyard after this man had watered the beast , and came to accuse him of malicious mischief , he denied it with a foul oath andp119the next day Goody Biggs ' young daughter fell into fits . Upon her mother asking her if they were caused by the foreign ostler at the Fleece , the girl said they were , and that she had been bewitched. 5 . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been cropped , the scar of an apparent brand burn on his cheek had been tampered with so its letter was uncertain , and many thought Satan might have made it . There was found also a large mole on his arse shaped like a cloven hoof . There is thus no possible doubt that this man who gave his name as Guy Smith , alias Peyto , has formed a covenant with the devil . And we demand that he be burned at once without trial . " Winthrop folded the paper and put it back in his pocket . There was a long shocked silence , during which Martha began to weep . Finally Margaret said in a trembling voice , " This is fearful , my husband , surely they wo n't burn him  --  if these , these horrors be indeed true , yet surely he may but hang . " " They can neither burn nor hang him without a trial , " said Jack sternly . " My father told them that . But they were very angry and Doggett quoted Moses ' own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or woman that bath a familiar spirit , or that is a wizard shall surely be put to death . ' " " What have they done with Peyto ? " asked Harry roughly . He believed in witchcraft , of course , and it was true that his servant had uncanny skill at reading his peculiar cards , but for the rest the charges were ridiculous ; he knew Peyto as well as he did his brothers . " He was chained in the cellar of the Fleece , " said Winthrop , " but just before prayers Doggett sent word to me that he has escaped . They think he bewitched the cook 's little lad , who helped him . " Fortunately nobody but Elizabeth was looking at Harry , for lie could not hide his relief , while Jack said , " I did not know that . He 'll get away then , out of the country , and perhaps the trouble will be over ! " Winthrop shook his head . " He 'll not get far in this weather ; he fled naked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out searchingfor him . We must at once rouse all our Manor folk to help . " He 'll come here to me , Harry thought . Even now Peyto might be hiding in the abandoned mill on the Box they had used for their meetings these past weeks . " Aye  --  " he cried jumping up . " Thep120Manor must be roused . I 'll set about it now . It horrifies me inexpressiblyto hear that Peyto has lost his soul . How right you were , Father , to forbid me his foul company , and what a deluded fool I was ! " The harrassed Winthrop heard nothing but proper sentiment in this speech ; the women were exclaiming and shuddering , except Elizabeth who guessed her husband 's motives well enough , and was frightened , while she rushed after him whispering , " Oh , my dear , be careful ! " He nodded , grabbed his cloak from a peg , and ran out to the stables , shouting for his horse . When she returned to the group , she caught Jack looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said nothing , and she noted that he made delays in joining Forth who had already gone to alert the servants . Pray God Sally holds her tongue about the message , thought Elizabeth , her heart thudding . She ran to the offices and found Sally alone crouched by a candle in the brewery , clumsily mending one of Elizabeth 's plain lawn collars . " Would you like that collar for your own , Sal ? " she whispered . The girl goggled at her and finally said , " Yus , thot I would , ma'am . " " Then say nothing of the message to Master Harry . You have n't , have you ? " Sally shook her head . " Oi 'd be afeared . Oi 'm feared of going tew bed even  --  Oh , ma'am ! " " No , no  --  " said Elizabeth urgently . " There 's no need for fear . Peyto 's no witch . Why , you liked him when he was here ! It 's just those Boxford folk have gone mad ! " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a constant rivalry with Boxford . The girl nodded slowly . " Oi wo n't say naught . Oi 'd never make tr-rouble fur Marster Harry . " " Good lass . " Elizabeth smiled at her . " And wear the collar on Sunday ! " She walked slowly back to the parlor , conscious now of the fluttering burden she carried , though her waist had thickened but little . The men had disappeared ; Margaret was sitting by the fire , idle for once , her hands clasped on her belly where a dull pain mingled with the movements of her own child which had also lately quickened . Margaret was forty , had borne five children and buried one , Nathaniel , and she suffered many discomforts this time though she never complained . " Sit down , Bess , " she said gently . " You look white . You must not let this horrible business upset you , it might mark the babe.  |p121Let  us talk of other matters  --  or Mary , read aloud to us , dear . What have you there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her book , for she was short-sighted . She looked up and said , " ' T is a description of , New England by a Captain John Smith , a great warrior it seems . Brother John gave it to me , it tells of the very land we 're going to . " Margaret had long since resigned herself to the move her husbandso delighted in and she said , " That will be most interesting . " Martha who had been huddled nervously on a stool by the fire , brightened . She never found pleasure in reading herself , but she loved hearing stories . She took silks , needle and a half-finished purse from her pocket and continued its embroidery . The purse was for Jack 's birthday gift in February , but she had told this to nobody . " Captain Smith is writing  --  " said Mary , " about the country of the Massachusetts  --  is that not where my father will go ? " Margaret nodded , and the girl went on , " He says itis the Paradise of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with corne ; groves , mulberries , salvagegardens , and good harbours  --  " She stopped , for they heard a sinister clamor outside , the hallooing of men , the barking of hounds , the thump of horses , all mingled with the long drawn wailing of a horn . The women looked towards the windows . " The hue and cry , " said Margaret faintly . " They 've not caught him yet , then . " " I pray they do n't , " said Elizabeth . It sounded like the howlingstampede of great bloodthirsty beasts out there , and the beautiful firelit parlor suddenly seemed full of fear-stench . " I know , " said Margaret . She reached to the table and poured cups of mead . " But Scriptures also say Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live . ' We must keep God 's Law . Perhaps some mead will strengthen us . . . " She gestured towards the cups . " And go on reading , Mary . " The young girls obeyed , but Elizabeth stood up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disquieted to stay . I 'll go to bed . " She was in a fever of worry for Harry , and suddenly it occurred to her that if he needed her help she had best be alone in their bedroom . The hue and cry passed on towards Castling 's Heath , and dwindled away while she sat waiting . It was near midnight when Harry came stamping into theirp122room ; the sleet had changed to snow , and he shook flakes off his shoulders , crying loudly , " No , Bess  --  alack , we have n't found the skulking bastard yet ! But no doubt will , as soon as it 's light ! " She saw that this was for the benefit of his brothers in the passage ; and when Harry had shut and bolted their door , he held his raw hands to the fire murmuring , " I 've got him safe . ' T was a near thing . The hue and cry went by us , but I had him on the saddle with me , covered by my cloak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she whispered helping to pull off the sodden boots . " D' you remember the old attic we used to climb to from the bakehouse ? " " To be sure , and the hours I lurked there the day your father flogged me  --  Oh , Harry  --  you 've never put him there ! In this very house ! " She sank down on the hearth settle and began to laugh hysterically . " Hush ! " he said . " There 's naught for merriment . He 's half froze , starved , he 's hurt his foot , and I know not how to free him either . I must fetch him food tonight , since all day the bakehouseis in use . " " There was a little door bolted , behind that suit of armor , I remember  --  " she said . " It must lead to the other attics . Let 's try and get it open now . " Harry bent to hug her . " That 's my plucky girl . I told Peyto you 'd be with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor little wag . " During the days that they managed to tend Peyto , Harry and Elizabeth were nearer in spirit than they had ever been , or were to be again , and both of them enjoyed the perils of their adventure , though well aware of the gypsy 's pathos and continuing danger . The hidden door was warped , cobwebbed , and the bolt rusted so fast that it had to be shattered , but Harry nonetheless managed to open it and then it was easier to visit Peyto . The servants who slept in the far attic chambers complained of noises and footstepsin the night . Upon hearing of this from Sally , Elizabeth said anxiously , " Oh , I hope it is not old Adam Winthrop the first , who is walking ' again . ' T is supposed to be bad luck to those who see him ! " That disposed of all nosiness on the part of the servants , and as for the family , Margaret , and the younger members had never heard of that particular attic , while John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember it now . Boxford and Groton folk , having beat over every foot of ground for miles , came to the reasonable conclusion that the Devil hadp123again saved his own . In fact Goody Biggs 's young daughter said she had seen Peyto flying past her window on a broomstick before dissolving into a ball of fire , so there could be little doubt how he got away . There remained only one thing the uneasy townsfolk could do to insure themselves against further malignant sorcery . On the third day after Peyto 's disappearance they gathered around a pyre of burning faggots in the marketplace and solemnly burned Peyto 's familiar , the little black donkey . There were several who were enraged when they found the donkey already dead in the stable before the burning , because someone had stabbed it to the heart , but more were secretly relieved . Many folk who did not mind a bull- or bear-baiting , because it was sport , were squeamish about the agonies of fire . The minister , Mr. Grant , read the old form of exorcism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine prayer of his own . The landlord of the Fleece invited all to open house , and it was generally admitted that the whole grievous matter were best forgotten now . In a day or so Reynolds , Biggs , and others of the erstwhile emigrants sheepishly returned to Groton Manor and asked Governor Winthrop to reinstate their names for the Plantation , whereat he was much pleased and relieved . But in the meantime Peyto still lay hidden in the attic by the bakehouse . Besides injuring his foot he had caught a fearful cold the night of his escape , and spent the time shivering and coughingwith his face muffled by the velvet robes of a long-dead Winthrop , so that no untoward sound might be heard . Elizabeth smuggled to him flaxseed poultices and infusions of camomile , along with all the food she or Harry dared sneak from the pantries . Peyto gradually improved and might soon escape to the North where he wanted to go , but there were difficulties . His wrenched or broken foot  --  Elizabeth was not sure which  --  would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor Harry had any money to give him , let alone the means of getting him some sort of mount . It was on Christmas Eve , and Peyto had been there a week , when Elizabeth retired very early and requested that supper be sent up to her room . Sally brought her a jug of wine , half a cold cluck , and a large plum pasty garnished with holly , at which Elizabethstared with astonished pleasure . " It was Cook , ma'am , what made thot little ould Christmas pie , " said Sally defensively . " Being new to the Manor ways , and more'n half Papist if you arsk me . " " It 's all right , Sal . I 'm glad to have it ! "  |p124Elizabeth  ate moderately , then dumped the remains in a basket . She made sure that everyone was busy with supper below , includingHarry whose rather tipsy laugh she heard . She sneaked along the passages and up the little stairs that twisted around the kitchen chimney . She groped her way to the concealed door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , mournfully flexing his injured foot . There was light from a lantern Harry had brought him , and in consequence they had shrouded the small gable window with some Winthrop wife 's moth-eaten green cloak . Peyto had also made use of the chest 's contents to cover his nakedness , but the Elizabethan crimson doublet and breeches engulfedthe little man . They had cut all his hair off when they searched him for witch marks , so that now with his round head , cropped ears and sad dark eyes he looked like a costumed monkey Elizabeth had once seen at the Bartholomew Fair in London . " Cheer up , Peyto  --  " she said . " Look what I brought you ! " She gave him the food , stuck a branch of holly in her hair , and another in the slash of his doublet . " ' T is Christmas Eve ! " " Well I know it , Mistress  --  and I think I 'm not like to see an-other . " " Nonsense ! We 'll get you safe away from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at her . " Ye 've been good , Mistress . . . and my dear master . " To her dismay , he suddenly crumpled with his face on his arm and his shoulders heaved . " Would that I had my cards  --  " he moaned . " My tarot that they took from me and burned up like my poor donkey . But I must 've read the cards wrong on All Mallow 's Eve . Could I cast them again on Christmas Eve I 'd know surer . " " What do you mean ? " she cried . " Oh , Peyto , did the cards show you this dreadful trouble for you ? " He shook his head . " Never can I read them for me . It was for him . " " For Harry ? " she asked sharply . " What did you see ? " Again he shook his head . " Naught , naught . " He spoke with almost sullen misery . She looked at him frowning , while foreboding gripped her . " Wait ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayhap I can tell something from this ! " He turned her palm over and stared at it by the lantern light . " My mother taught me this wav too , though for long I 've not used it . " He stared at her palm , took the right one , and peered at them both , muttering , while she waited uneasily . He let her hands drop . " It was true what I saw before . "  | " What  --  ? " she whispered shrinking . " Death , " said Peyto , staring into the shadows of the attic . " Oh , not yours  --  death around ye , by water  --  by sickness  --  by madness  --  by bullets  --  by fire ! " " I 'll not believe it ! " she cried angrily . " Before God , Peyto , I believe you are in league with the devil . We should have let you burn ! " " Nay , nay , Mistress  --  " said the little man sadly . " ' T is not the devil gives my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient art we 've never lost . . . But there 's more than death and violence in your hands , Mistress  --  there 's love and far places and strivings  --  ever striving for something ye can not have . Freedom . Yell hanker after freedom , like my own people who can not live cribbed and cabined . " He reached out and took her right hand again , staring at the pink palm and its mesh of lines . " Yell get what ye want in the end , " he whispered , " but ye wo n't know it at first  --  for it 'll not be what ye thought to be seeking all the long years  --  all the long years . . . " he repeated , running his dirty brown finger down her life line . The door swung open and Harry stuck his head in . " What 's ado here ? " he cried laughing . " You graceless knave , you hold my wife 's hand behind my back ? " " Oh , hush ! " Elizabeth said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stumbled a little as he stooped to get through the door . " Peyto has been telling my fortune , and a most horrid one it is too . " " But yell be happy in the end , " said the gypsy earnestly . " And I ? " Harry stuck his big hand under Peyto 's nose . " Read me money and land , my boy ! And plenty of merriment , children too  --  a round dozen of ' em  --  eh , Bess , my beauty ? " But Peyto turned away . " I 'm weary , Master , " he said . He rested his chin on his knees and closed his eyes . Harry felt irritation . Peyto had lost all his gaiety and impudence , had become limp as a snared rabbit , and what was to be done with him anyway ? The problem was solved almost at once . " Hist ! " whispered Elizabeth . As Harry started to speak she put her hand over his mouth . They all heard approaching footsteps . Peyto sucked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chimney where he hid . The other two waited , until the little door opened and Jack walked in carrying a candle . " So  --  " he said looking calmly at Harry and Elizabeth , at the disordered robes on the floor , at the remains of food . " I might have guessed this sooner , but I fear my childhood play is long behind me . Where is he ? "  | " I do n't know what you mean , " began Harry , jutting his chin , but Elizabeth acted from surer instinct . " Oh , Jack  --  help us , help poor Peyto ! He 's still ill , and we ca n't go on like this . How did you find us ? " " Followed Harry 's noisy and by no means difficult trail , " said Jack with a faint smile , " though I 've suspected you had the gypsy hidden somewhere all along . " " Does Father ? " asked Harry quickly . " No . Nor do I think it wise to disturb him , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed involved in witchcraft . I wish to question him , and inspect the mole alleged to be a witch mark . " " Come out , Peyto ! " Harry called , and the gypsy obeyed , looking at once so forlorn and funny in his vast old-fashioned clothes , hopping on and off the bandaged foot , that Harry chuckled . Jack 's questions relative to the death of the six cows , the firing of Reynolds 's shoe shop , the fits of Goody Biggs 's daughter , did not take long to answer . Peyton denied knowledge of all the accusationsand Jack , who was intuitive , shrewd and almost free from superstition , knew that he heard the truth . Then Peyto pulled down his crimson breeches and presented the mole on his buttock for Jack 's examination , who was soon satisfied . " An ordinary round mole , " he said , " and I see no more likeness to a cloven hoof than to a skillet or a peppercorn . " " So you 'll help him get away ? " cried Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not walked in on the fortunetelling . " Aye  --  " said Jack , looking at the gypsy with pitying eyes as the man was racked with a spasm of coughing so violent that blood flecked his mouth and chin . Peyto got away next evening , properly clothed , with ten shillings in his pocket and his fare paid to London . Harry drove him , hidden in a farm cart , as far as Witham , then put Peyto on the Ipswich coach . Jack had made all easy , and provided the money . At the moment of parting the gypsy kissed Harry 's hands , wet them with his tears , whispering , " I 'll ne'cr see ye more , " and made a long speech in his own language . Harry clapped him on the back , and said " Farewell " with affection , but he was impatient to try the ale at Witham 's White Hart , and anyway the adventure was over . The White Hart 's charms proved alluring , and it was three days later before Harry came back to Groton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father by saying that he had sent Harry on an errand , and John Winthrop was far too busy with the everp127increasing details and problems of the Migration to question his eldest son . " I suppose you gave him extra money beyond that needed by Peyto ? " said Elizabeth with gloomy resignation to Jack one noon while they were still waiting for Harry 's return . " You might know he 'd drink it  --  or worse . " She and Harry had been so close for weeks , she had thought he would never leave her until he must . Jack said , " Aye , I 'm sorry , Bess , " looking at her discouraged face . " I should have known better . " His arm itched to hold her against him , and comfort her , but instead he swung on his heel , stalked out the door into the courtyard and ran smack into Martha who was hurrying from the washhouse with a pile of freshly ironed linen . Their collision was so violent that two of John Winthrop 's elaborate white ruffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was so great that presently Jack found his arm around her shoulders , and that he was comforting Martha instead . The girl , still clutching her linen , nestled against him , and before he knew it Jack had kissed her several times and found it very pleasant.  |p128IMMEDIATELY  after Christmas , John Winthrop went to London , and used for headquarters either the Downings ' home or Isaac Johnson 's house in Soper Lane . Despite inevitable annoyances and hindrances , the affairs of the Massachusetts Bay Company were prospering incredibly . God was smiling on the project . The Cambridge Agreement had stipulated that they sail in March , and they would be ready to sail in March  --  the ten chartered ships and also the splendid converted privateer of 350 tons which the Company had managed to buy for 750 pounds . This great ship once called the Eagle had been rechristened the Arbella . That gentle lady herself would sail on her , as well as the other principal passengers . Some seven hundred folk of all ages signed up for the Migrationto New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winthrop most regretfully had to turn down applicants . It disappointed him that only two ministers had agreed to sail at this time  --  George Phillips and John Wilson . Still , from those he had met at Scmpringham  --  Thomas Hooker , Roger Williams , and the redoubtable John Cotton of Boston  --  he had received constant backing and the hope that they might come later . In fact most of the nonconformist ministers throughout England had miraculously heard of the brave new colony which was to be founded to the glory of God , and had subtly encouraged their various flocks to consider removal . On Valentine 's Day , Emmanuel Downing returned to his home from a busy session at the Inner Temple and found Winthrop huddled over a table in the small parlor . The table was littered with passenger lists , bills of lading , agreements for provisions and a sheaf of letters from backers and persons of quality which John felt he must answer himself . He looked up as his **25;11192;TOOLONG and said jubilantly , " They come from a score of counties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half this realm ! " Downing glanced at the passenger lists and remarked , " ' T is true , but more from your Suffolk and Essex than the rest . It shows what faith in you they have who know you . And never did I think this work could be done so fast . . . You sail from Southampton then , the last week in March ? " John nodded . " If God sends us fair winds . " Downing yanked at the bell pull . " I 've a fancy for mulled sack , and ' twill do you good , you work too much . You 've grown haggard as a hound . The company has a deputy and assistants besides you . Why do n't you go home to Groton a while ? " " I shall this week , " said Winthrop . He picked up his goose quill and made a note . His hand quivered suddenly . " For the last time , " he added very low . Emmanuel loosened his doublet and settled his bulk in a chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T is hard to leave the place ye were born , harder still to leave the others  --  especially Margaret in her state . She 's a fine wife to you , John , loves you true . " Winthrop dropped his head , and said with an emotion that embarrassed the bluff Downing , " She is my heart 's comfort , my other self , and I sorrow to think how little of my time I 've given her of late . " " Well-a-day , " said Downing , hastily accepting a mug of hot sack from the servant . " I expect I 'd be sorry to part from my Lucy . Her prickles are wearing softer with the years , and she 's an able breeder like your Margaret . " Winthrop smiled , and took a sip of sack . " I 've good children  --  save Henry , I fear , though I believe he mends . " " Ah , in clutches large as ours , we must expect to hatch one goshawk , " said Downing , belching pleasurably . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt , unless I can beat it out of him . How is the beauteous Bess ? " " Tamer , it seems , as I hoped she would be in a truly God-fearing household . My wife is fond of her , and says she proves dutiful as  --  " he added with complacence , " does my son John , always ! " Downing laughed . " I vow you dote like a lover on that lad . " " Since the days when I had to whip some childish mischief out of him , never has he displeased me . " Winthrop began to gather up his papers thinking with tender pride of young John . The scene in the fields with Jack on the morning after Winthrop 's return to Groton Manor was therefore a severe shock . The Manor had not yet sold , though there were negotiations ,  |p130but  they were gradually selling off furnishings and stock , and a buyer had been found for one of the saddle horses . Winthrop went to the stables to conclude the transaction , while Jack as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trotted off on the horse , Winthrop turned towards the house , but Jack stopped him . " Could I speak with you privily , sir ? Might we walk a bit ? " It was a soft misty morning with the promise of sun , and the smell of fresh earth where the mole-catcher and his terrier were rooting through the new-turned fields . Winthrop , though a trifle startled and also suffering pangs at viewing the dear lands he was so shortly to leave , gladly acquiesced . They walked past the dovecoteand the pond , and up the manor rise where they could see their sheep-filled pastures , and the nearby pinnacles on Groton Church . Far to the south soared the graceful tower of the church at Stoke-by-Nayland . They came to the hedge and stile near the highway , and Winthropstopped . " Well , what is it , John ? I 've much ado at the house . " He examined his son 's embarrassed face , and said with faint humor , " You 've not fallen in love , have you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then down at the blackthorn hedge . " Yes sir . . . that is I think . . . I think it wise to change my state , I mean it would be helpful here and even more so when I finally join you in New England . " " But , of course , son  --  ' t is most natural . " Winthrop smiled and put his hand on Jack 's shoulder . " Why , you 've just turned twentyfour , have you not ? I can scarce credit it . Who is the lady , not  --  " he said eagerly , " Mary Waldcgrave , or one of the Alabasters ? " " No , sir , " said Jack , still staring at the tangled blackthorns . " ' T is little Mattic  --  my cousin Martha . " There was a sharp and painful silence . Winthrop 's hand dropped from Jack 's shoulder . The mole-catcher 's dog streaked by barking frantically , and Winthrop called out with irritation , " Tom ! Quiet that cur ! Take him away ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . He pulled his forelock and grabbed his dog . " I 'm sorry , sir , " said Jack . " I did n't think you 'd be so displeased . She 's a sweet gentle girl and I  --  I 've grown fond of her . " Winthrop clenched his hands and rage flamed through him . " Is there nobody for my sons to wed but those Fones wenches ! " he shouted . " If you must marry your cousins are there not plenty of others to pick from ! Or is this like Henry 's , a case of needs-Must-wed ' ? "  |p131Jack  stiffened and stared angrily back at his father . " It is NOT ! And naturally I shall not go on if you forbid the match , though I did not expect your violent opposition and have applied for speciallicense . " " Without consulting me ! " " It will not be used until you give consent , sir , but I may remind you that I am of full age and that you have entrusted my judgment in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . " God forbid that there should be anger between us , " he said at last in a trembling voice . " But , John , you and Martha are so near akin  --  that could n't be helped with Henry  --  and she has no lands , no portion  --  " " She has four hundred pounds , sir , and a tender docile heart . " Winthrop was silent trying to master his disappointment . Alwayshe had thought that Jack would marry well , even grandly , and of late he had hoped that in the new land the boy might choose from one of the aristocratic planters ' families . A Saltonstallperhaps , or even some kin of the Earl of Lincoln . . . that is if there were no previous match with a fine Suffolk family like the Waldegraves . And all these hopes to be dissolved by little Matt Fones ! Yet he loved his son and could not bear the cloud between them . Also he felt that there was about Jack 's choice some strange motivation that he could not fathom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoulder . " I can not pretend this is not a blow . It may be the Lord wishes to chastise me that I may not take for granted all the success and benefits He has heaped upon my Company . I do not forbid the match , my son , but I ask that you will wait before you wed , wait and pray , as I shall , that God will show you His true will . " Jack seized his father 's hand and grasped it warmly . " Thank you , sir . We 'll wait , and I 'll try to pray on it . " I 'm glad to wait , he thought ruefully . The sudden application for special license had been an impulse designed to hide from himself his own lukewarmness . Yet  --  Martha  --  so gentle , so trusting  --  and so joyful . She had misunderstood his kisses and gratitude on his birthday , February 12 , when she had given him the embroidered purse . He had found himself betrothed to her without quite knowing how it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that afternoon when Martha rushed in with the news . The girl was so excited that she did n't notice that Harry clad only in his breeches was shaving his golden beard at the washbasin . " Bess , Bess ! " cried Martha , her small face transfigured . " Fancy what 's happened ! "  | " I fancy you might knock , child ! " Elizabeth snapped . Lately she had found Martha exasperating for a very good reason which she was too honest to deny to herself . Also she had just discovered that she could no longer fit into her favorite velvet dress no matter how she loosened the waist . " But listen ! " cried Martha , flinging her arms around her sister 's neck . " jack and I are to be wed ! He 's writing the Archbishop for a license . Oh , Bess , I 'm so happy ! " Elizabeth swayed and her bright cheeks went gray . Her silence penetrated even Martha 's rapture . " What 's the matter ? " cried the little sister , anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A belly qualm . . . " Elizabeth murmured . " I think the herring was tainted . " She could not embrace Martha . She sank instead on the bed , fighting a churning jealousy . " What 's that ? " cried Harry striding over from the washbasin , his strong chest naked and damp . " What was that you told Bess , Matt ? " " That Jack and I are to be wed , " answered the girl less surely . " He  --  he asked me not an hour ago . " Harry stared ,  --  then he flung his razor to the floor and threw back his head with a roar of laughter . " By God and all the little devils ! This is beyond all ! Oh , this is a jape ! " He laughed so hard he choked . " Why do you laugh , Harry . . . " Martha whispered , and her underlip began to tremble . " I laugh for what my father will say ! " cried Harry between gasps . " He that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glee , oh rapture that I should see the day when jack has fallen out of favor ! " " Harry ! You 're cruel ! " Elizabeth cried , starting from the bed . " There , there Matkin  --  ' t is not bad as all that ! " She put her arm around her sister , forgetting everything but the terrified stricken look in the brown eyes that had been so joyous a moment before . " You mean Uncle John will forbid us ? " the girl murmured shrinking into herself . " Ile wo n't want me for jack ? Aye , of course , he wo n't ! How could he ? What a dolt I was . And no doubt Jack did n't really mean to wed me , he was but being gallant . " All her hard-won confidence had vanished . She turned away from Elizabeth , and dragged over to the window , where she rested her forehead against the panes . " Oh , come now , Matt ! " Harry cried with some contrition . Martha was far too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p133but  he was fond enough of her , when he noticed her . " You need n't sag like a punctured pig 's bladder ! Jack 'll talk Father ' round in time , I should n't wonder , if need be the same way I got Bess . " " If he really wants to , " Martha whispered , scarcely listening . " But I am not Bess . " She turned and looked at her sister , dimly hearing as she spoke that her words held deeper meaning than she had known , and she felt an added thrust of bewildered pain . She looked quickly away from Elizabeth  --  the elder one , the strong one , the beautiful one , who had surely never known defeat . Elizabeth saw the stiffening , and knew the miserable barrier that had risen between them . " ' Twill be all right , dearling , " she said with effort . " You 'll be very happy , Mattie , you 'll see , " and she kissed her . Martha responded a little , but there was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Harry returned to his shavingand began to sing : " Troll the bowl , the nut-brown bowl , And here 's kind mate to thee ! Let 's sing a dirge for St. Hugh 's soul , And down it merrily .

" " You 're in high fettle , " observed Elizabeth bleakly as he sluiced his face and head , emerged with yellow curls dripping , and his face ruddy . " Why not , my sweet ? Jack 's love affair amuses me . Life amuses me . I 'm strong and I 'm young . I 've a fair wife  --  " he blew her a kiss , " who is plumped as a plum by my fair son  --  and I 'm off to the Fox for a whet of March beer !

Harry , who had been adjusting his sword belt over his black satin doublet , looked at her with surprise . " For what , my pet ? " " Harry  --  " she said , her hand tightening on his wrist . " How soon will you be leaving with your father and the little boys ? Leaving for good , I mean . "  | " Oh , " he put his arm around her , " ' twill be soon , dear heart . Ten clays at most . The Arbella 's ready now at Hampton , you know . But think not on that  --  we 'll have merry times yet to-gether . " " Do n't go ! " she cried in sudden anguish . " Harry , do n't leave me here ! Make some excuse . Do n't leave me here with them ! " " With them ? " he repeated , stroking her hair and frowning . He had never heard her so desperate and wild . " Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast and clung to him frantically . " I could n't bear it . " Harry took her by the shoulders and pushed her away from him . He lifted her convulsed face and stared at her . " WHAT could n't you bear ? " he said sharply . " What am I to understand by that ? " His blue eyes had gone hard as turquoises and they held an ugly light she had never seen . " Nothing , " she faltered , while an inner voice whispered : You fool ! What havoc are you trying to make ? She drew a harsh breath , and said more calmly , " I mean nothing , Harry , except that bereft of my husband I am weak enough to flinch from the sight of other happy lovers . What else could you think ? " His grip on her loosened , the glint faded slowly from his eyes as he relinquished the extraordinary suspicion which had suddenly assailed him .

" Come  --  no more moping ! Smile for me , Bess ... " She moistened her lips and lifted their corners a trifle . He kissed her lightly on the mouth and went out the door singing , " 0 , troll the bowl , the nut-brown bowl . " John Winthrop could stay but a few clays at Groton , and on the 26th of February there came the last farewells . At eight of a cold gray morning , the entire family assembled in the Manor courtyardwhere three horses awaited , and two farm carts piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor'sgoods and servants had been sent on their way days ago . While the women , Winthrop , and Jack himself , still observed the full year 's mourning for Thomas Fones and old Mistress Win/throp , the rule had been relaxed for Harry and the small boys , Stephen and Adam . These latter all had new clothes for the journey . Harry was handsome as a hawfinch in his long ruddy-brown jacket , his slate-blue cape and broad-plumed hat . His new Cordovan leather boots had been made by Reynolds , the Boxford cordwainer , and were cut with swagger . Winthrop had not begrudgedthe money for this finery , so long as it was practical  --  the gentry must dress according to their rank  --  and he himself had a store of elaborate lace-edged ruffs and shoe buckles of glittering silver and steel . Stephen and Adam were both gay in Lincoln green and Margaret could not bear to look at them as they cavorted around the horses , squealing with excitement . She had wept last night in John 's arms , and he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to comfort her with the words and promises of God . I 'll not break down again now , Margaret thought  --  but dear Lord they are so young , my little lads  --  if I should never see them more  --  and John . He came up to her then as she stood on the steps between Elizabeth and Mary . Martha had withdrawn to a corner by the mounting post . " It is time , my own dear heart , " said Winthrop softly , kissing Margaret on the cheek . " If we meet not here on earth again , we shall do so in heaven . Remember Mondays and Fridays at five , as I shall . " " Yes  --  yes  --  " said Margaret , trying to smile , and thinking how little people knew her John who thought him severe , for they had made a pact to commune with each other in spirit at these hours , no matter the distance that separated them . " Farewell , " she whispered , " I ca n't say more . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ; the seven-year-old Deane , the baby Samuel , Forth and Mary , Elizabeth , and after the slightest hesitation  --  Martha , who responded with a muffled " God be with you , sir . " At no time had her uncle mentioned her betrothal to Jack , but Jack had told her of his promise to wait and soothed her with evidences of affection , so that she had been reassured . Jack too was leaving now to accompanyhis father as far as London , and though this separation could not compare with that of Elizabeth and Harry , or the elder Winthrops , she was much downcast , for Jack seemed to have forgotten her while he and Harry greeted the relatives and neighbors and tenants who were flocking into the courtyard for the good speedings . A watery sun blinked over the Manor 's mossy roof tiles whenp136Winthrop having shaken all the well-wishing hands , gave the signal to mount . Harry dashed up to Elizabeth and enfolded her in a hug . " Be good and patient , sweetheart ! " he cried gaily . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind you give me a fine bouncing son ! " He chucked her under the chin and strode off to his horse . She watched him with dull misery . They had made love last night , and she had wept then . Now she was dry-eyed , but as the little cavalcade and carts started from the courtyard , she hurried down the steps and called , " Harry ! Harry ! " In the din and confusion he did not hear her . She drew back against the house wall . What had she meant by that cry ? Not to keep him here , for that would be impossible , not a plea for one last word , they had said all there was to say between them , and never had that been much . The cry had come from some unplumbeddepths , and she knew there had been fear in it . The others ran out on the road watching and waving until Harry 's tall blue-caped figure disappeared last of all around the bend to Boxford , but Elizabeth returned to Margaret , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat down heavily beside Margaret and put her arm around her . The two women leaned against each other a long time without speaking . On Saturday , April the tenth , of that year 1630 , Governor John Winthrop stood with several others on the swaying poop deck of the Arbella and looked his last at England . Far to the north , Cornwall faded on the dipping horizon , and the great dark cliffs of " The Lizard " merged into an increasingly foggy sky . " We are truly on the way at last  --  " said Winthrop solemnly . He turned with his air of command to the lean earnest minister who stood beside him . " Mr. Phillips , be good enough to pray for us ! " " Yes , " agreed the Lady Arbclla sighing . She sat on a small walnut armchair which was nailed to the deck and had been carved with her family coat of arms . From her ermine hood her pale face strained back towards England . Young Anne Bradstreet who sat beside Arbella on a stool could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitted skin . In Anne 's mind verses began to form themselves as always when she sought comfort . " Be still thou unregenerate part . Disturb no more my settled heart "  --  and she thought of her husband whom she loved , and wished he had come on deck . But Simon Bradstreethad disappeared with William Coddington and Isaac John/son to quell some fight amongst the servants in the fo'castle . Anne 's father , Thomas Dudley , was confined to his cabin with a sharp attack of gout , while many of the other passengers like Sir Richard Saltonstall , and most of the women , lay ire their bunks retching with seasickness . Though they had been near a fortnight on board , contrary winds and minor mishaps had so delayed them near the Isle of Wight that until now they had always been in sight of land , and even had opportunity to disembark at times . A few minutes ago Captain Peter Milbourne had summoned to the poop deck those of his top-ranking passengers who were able . " ' T is farewell for sartin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " he boomed cheerfully , squinting his keen salt-bleached eyes towards the vanishing shore , then quickly up at his taut sails . " We 'll soon be past the Scillies . After there 's naught ' twixt us and your Promised Land but three thousand mile o ' water , and  --  if God be willing  --  " he interpolated this in deference to these Puritan folk , though he was none himself , " a run o ' codfish off the Banks . We 'll have need o ' them beasties , I 'll warrant ! " He bowed and stamped off to his quarters , for a noggin of rum and another glance at his chart and cross-staff . The minister , George Phillips , did not at once respond to Winthrop'srequest for prayer . IIe was a gaunt little man like a whippetwith eyes grown myopic from much learned reading . As he stood watching the blur of England slide below the waves , he knew a bleak misgiving . I 'll not be at the Governor 's beck and call , he thought , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Request " we wrote at Yarmouth . " Aye  --  " he said , at length , smiling faintly at Lady Arbella . " I will pray that God guide our perilous journey , but now that our last link with that dear land of our birth is gone , I would first remind us that we go not like those invidious Separatists who wrangle and rant at Plymouth Colony in the New World . For we will never forget the Church of England , our dear Mother , from whence we rise , and we go forth but for the enlargement of her bounds in the Kingdom of Christ Jesus , and I will pray in the exact words of our prayer book . 0 Eternal God , who alone spreadest out the heavens , and rulest the raging of the Sea , we commend to thy almighty protection ... ' When he had finished , Winthrop said " Amen " with the others , though annoyed that the only minister on board the Arbella should be laggard in extempore praying , and at once more independentand yet hidebound by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no help for it now , and John 's heart was oppressed by other matters . Not only the poignant visions ofp138home they were all having  --  he thought of Margaret , seeing her in the Manor garden near the mulberry tree , wondering if the babe were delivered yet  --  but he had another carking worry . They were two passengers short on the Arbella . While the fleet had yet lingered at the Isle of Wight , John had sent Harry ashore with a young man called William Pelham to locate some missing cattle which should have been delivered to the ship . In due course the cattle arrived but neither Harry nor Pelham did . And a servant later reported that the young men , thinking there was plenty of time before sailing , had gone back to Southampton . Each day John had waited , but there was no sign of Harry , and the Arbella had finally left without him . " You look dejected , sir , " said Lady Arbella gently , gazing at the black-caped Governor , whose firm mouth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose heavy lids veiled his eyes . " You 've left so many dear to you at home  --  nay I mean in England  --  for we must call the new land home now  --  ' t is hard to be resolute  --  but think as I do of the wondrous farewell sermon Master John Cotton preached to us at Southampton . We will be heartened by God like the children of Israel . " Winthrop started , and took the stool Anne Bradstreet had just vacated . " And indeed you hearten us all , my lady , " John said fervently . " I fear I was thinking of my son Henry  --  what has become of him  --  though well I suspect . " His lips tightened . She also suspected what had become of Henry , as did all on the ship , but was far too courteous to say anything . While she strove for a comforting word , John added flatly , " There are many taverns in Hampton . " He will come by another ship , " she said quickly . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " No . IIe was anxious to emigrate . But I wished him with ME . I was a fool to trust him on shore again . Sometimes , my lady , I am very foolish , and overconfident . Arrogantin mine own opinions . " " No , no , " she said , laying her delicate white hand on Winthrop'sknee . " You do yourself injustice ! " She , like her husband Isaac , was of those who thoroughly admired the Governor , nor thought him arrogant , as did her old steward Thomas Dudley . Though , to be sure , Winthrop never showed Arbella aught but deference and a warm subtle recognition of her beauty as well as rank . She thought him a charming man . " And look  --  " she said smiling . " Take comfort that your two younger sons are frisky asEngland , 1617  --  1631 139p139pups ! " She pointed through the carved wooden rail to the deck beneath where Stephen and Adam with many of the other children on board were engaged in an uproarious tug-of-war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarry rope each time the ship lurched down a wave . " And look there ! " she said , pointing to two ships whose flags and sails were faintly discernible through the increasing mist . " Are n't those of our fleet ? Perhaps your son Henry is on one of them ! " Winthrop peered out to sea , and shook his head . " No , my lady , those are still the Ambrose and the Jewel which have stayed near us since Yarmouth . But we 've lost the Talbot , long ago . I hope , " he said with sudden anger , " Henry is safe AND repentant on the Talbot . " Harry was indeed on the Talbot , but he was not in the least repentant . He was enjoying himself mightily ; showing off his seamanship , dicing with the boon companions he had found , prodigally ordering casks of spirits opened at will , and commanding obedience because he was the Governor 's son . He had not deliberatelyset out to miss the Arbella 's sailing , but the Mariner 's Ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait for the tardy winds to blow ; moreover Will Pelham who was cousin to the Earl of Lincoln was well provided with pounds , and willing to spend them . Then Harry 's normally strong head was vanquished by some innocent-looking Dutch liquor two soldiers provided , and it was several days before he awakened one morning in a shabby room at the Dolphin , cold sober at last , to find a giggling Flemish whore in his bed . " God damn you , get out ! " he cried , kicking her , and such was the glare of his bloodshot eyes that she scuttled from the sour roorn . Harry poured a jugful of water over his head , pulled on his clothes which nobody seemed to have stolen , staggered from the Dolphin and down to the Ordinary on the quay . Here , where he demanded meat and ale , he found two military men who seemed mistily familiar . A big red-haired one , and a dapper dark one , breakfasting by the fire which glinted on their engraved steel cuirasses and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So ho ! " cried the dark one chuckling , as Harry entered . " Here 's our bully boy , at last ! Have you guzzled and wenched your fill , lad ? Then come breakfast with us . " Harry grinned ruefully as he joined them . " I 'd no notion I was so cup-shot ! We 've met , gentlemen ? "  | " Now there 's gratitude for ye , " said the red-haired one mournfully . " When we 've been your chums this past three days , sharing our precious genever and loving ye like a brother ! " " Oh , " said Harry . " That was it . My apologies , sirs , but  --  " " Ye do n't recall  --  well ' t is no crime . Me  --  " said the redhairedone , " I 'm Daniel Patrick , and him  --  " he pointed across the table , " is John Underhill , and you 'd best mind us , me gossoon  --  since we 're both captains in your father 's company , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile burst out in a guffaw , and slapped Harry on the back . Harry choked on a gobbet of meat , then drank his ale with avid thirst . So these were the two men John Winthrop had hired to protect the colonists , and give them military training . He had heard Jack discuss them with his father . Both captains had seen much service in the Netherlands , and had married Dutch wives . They were both in the early thirties , and stalwart men by the look of them . Underhill he remembered had spent his early years at Kenilworth Castle , where his father had been steward to the great Earl of Leicester , Queen Elizabeth 's favorite , but of Patrick he knew nothing , and was curious about the lilt and intonation in his voice . " Would you be from the north country , Captain Patrick ? " he asked . Patrick responded with a twinkle . " That I would , young sir  --  but not the north of this one ! The saints forbid  --  ooh  --  " he said clapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a word I must NOT use . Do n't ye be telling your father on me ! " " You 're Irish ? " exclaimed Harry , beginning to laugh . " And aPAPIST ! " " Papist no more ! I 've recanted long ago . And why would n't I , when the good monks who raised me kicked me out o ' the monasteryon me bum , one fine day  --  not but what I 'm grateful to ' em . A devilish poor monk I 'd a made , but I 'm a fair soldier ! " He chuckled and wiped his mouth on the sleeve of his buff coat . Harry laughed again , not sure how much of this was serious , but perfectly certain his father had no inkling of any Papist tinge infilteringhis company , and at this thought Harry started and said , " My God ! The Arbella must have sailed ! " " She has  --  " said Underhill , shrugging . " You gave the Governorthe slip , eh ? Your friend Mr. Pelham got on the Mayflower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I said we 'd do our best if you turned up , and now you have , we 'd best be off to the Talbot . She 's riding down Hampton water and the wind 's shifting ! "  |p141Before  they left , Harry scrawled a note to Elizabeth , moved by compunction for the way he had spent these last nights , and he ended it with all his love and a row of crosses for kisses . He told Daniel Patrick about her too during the long evenings at sea , but this did not prevent him from flirting with the lasses on board , nor with Patrick 's pretty Dutch wife Anneke who spoke little English but was plump and rosy as an apple . John Underhill 's wife Helena was also on board , but she was fat and chiefly concerned with hopeless efforts to eradicate the Talbot 's vermin and filth . Elizabeth received the note at Groton on the day after Margaret had been painfully delivered of a puny baby girl , who was baptizedAnn on April 29 . Despite Goody Hawes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger for some days , and Elizabeth had her hands full helping the midwife with the nursing ; and though she cried a little over the note , she had few thoughts for Harry , and it was impossible not to feel exasperated too . " You might know he 'd manage to miss the ship , " she said to Martha , shoving the note into her bosom . " Lord , I hope they 've no taverns yet in the Massachusetts , not that Harry could n't find spirits in a howling wilderness , or the bottom of the sea , if he wanted to . The Devil must guide him . " " Do n't say that , Bess , " cried Martha sharply . " You talk some times , as though  --  as though you did n't love Harry  --  not the way I love jack ! " There was no answer to this , and Elizabeth , now that jack was in London , had recovered her protective fondness for her sister . She merely smiled and went to her surgery where she was steeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her uneasilyand tried to help , but her fingers were clumsy and her mind elsewhere . Suddenly she said , " Bess , do n't be vexed with me , but are you sure you 're right in letting our folk celebrate May Day tomorrow ? Our Uncle Winthrop would never permit it ... " " No more he would n't , " said Elizabeth dryly , crushing rowan berries to put in the bubbling flaxseed . " But our grandfather did , and I see no harm in it . ' Twill sweeten the malcontents on the Manor , and besides ' t is time we had some merriment . I 'm sick of long faces . " Martha brightened for a moment , looking trustfully at Elizabeth , then she shook her head . " But how can you want merriment , when your time is so near ? " said Martha dolefully . She had been much frightened by Margaret 's recent agonies and danger , andp142Elizabeth 's own baby was due soon . " Oh , I wish Jack was here to tell us what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth thought . Nor was Forth at the Manor , he had gone on a long visit to Exeter . Thus it was  --  Margaret being too ill for consultation  --  that a delegation of Groton villagers had waited on Elizabeth as sole authority and requested permission to have dancing and May games on the Manor lawn as it was in old Squire Adam 's day . Pond , the miller , was spokesman , and he had added , " Oi 'll not conceal it from ye , Mistress  --  there be surliness an ' grudgings in some quarters ' gainst Wintrups  --  they know ye mean to sell , ' n they do n't fancy their homes ' n loivelihoods bandied about bike sacks o ' corn . Thass the truth . " There were murmurs of assent from the other men . Old Kembold , the thatcher , stepped forward and said angrily , " The Squoire 've unsettled us , he hev  --  luring off our young men overseas to be ate by salvages  --  deserr-rting us ye maught say ; wen toimes is bad enough here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hould wi ' all this sarmonizing ' n stinting the good ould ways  --  " His voice which had risen , stopped with a grunt because Pond had trodden on his foot . The miller said apologetically , " We do n't mean fur to berate you , Mistress , it was just if we maught have a little ould May Fair , ' n a bit o ' sport , Mike we used to , them as grumbles ' d forget ... " " I do n't see why not ! " said Elizabeth hardily . " Do as you please . " And she smiled at them . They shuffled out in a cloud of gratitude and compliments . " A foine young ' oman "  --  " even though breeding she 's a comely poppet "  --  " Now if Marster Harry were squoire mattcrs'ld stand different . " Elizabeth heard some of this and was naturally elated . It was agreeable to be head of the Manor , even temporarily , and she was not worried about Jack 's feelings when he found out . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor lady was too miserable with milk-leg , sore breasts , and worry about the muchlonged-forbaby girl to give heed to Elizabeth 's offhand informationabout " some Saturday games for the village . " Elizabeth had not however envisioned quite what ensued . May Day dawned warm and shimmering . A steadfast sun drew up perfume from dew-spangled carnations and honeysuckle . It gilded the field of daffodils by the garden wall . Song thrushes warbled in the flowering hedgerows , robins chirped on the lawns amongst tiny pink daisies , and from the copse near the church a cuckoo called twelve times , which was good luck , thought Eliza/beth as she awoke and counted . She turned and kissed Martha who slept with her , now that Harry was gone . " Wake up , sleepyhead  --  Listen , someone 's singing ! " The door flew open and disclosed Sally with a great branch of hawthorn . " Good morrow , Good morrow , good mistress I wish you a happy dayPlease to smell my garlandBecause ' t is the first of May " sang Sally in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Elizabeth 's nose . Sally set down the mugs of morning ale and pulled the bed curtains . " They making ready for the fair ? " asked Elizabeth , drinking her ale . She felt extraordinarily well this morning , full of restless energy . I wish I could dance , she thought , but I can wash my face in the May dew , and she motioned for her red woolen chamber gown . " Thass roight , " answered Sally , her squint-eyes sparkling . " Wat Vintener arst me to go with him , thot means he 's to be me boy  --  Oh but we 'll have a toime ! " The girl giggled , but suddenly remembered something . " Oh ma'am  --  Vicar 's below in the Hall , been waiting fur ye . He is in a taking ! " Elizabeth muttered one of Harry 's best oaths . She had forgottentheir rector , Mr. Leigh , chiefly because between Sundays everyone did forget him . He was a pallid wispy man who had pleased John Winthrop with interminable and learned sermons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the Hall , where Mr. Leigh was pacing up and down the tiles , his black gown flapping , the falling bands of his white collar all askew . " Mistress Elizabeth ! " he cried when he saw her . " Did you permit this monstrous ribaldry  --  do you know what they'reDOING ? " " I said they could have a May Fair . " " My dear young lady , they 've put up a MAYPOLE ! " The word shuddered from his lips as though he announced that the flaming pits of hell had opened on the Manor lawn . " Oh  --  " said Elizabeth weakly . Of all heathenish rites Puritansconsidered Maypole dancing the worst , and Winthrop had once gravely explained to his family the lewd symbol involved . " Well , I ca n't stop them now , " she said . " I 'm sorry . " " I forbid it , " cried Mr. Leigh in a high quavering voice . " Ip144wo n't have orgies in my parish , why they 've got tons of strong ale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage for  --  play-acting . They 've gone mad , all of them except a few of my godly folk . You 'd think us back in Papist days . Mr. Winthrop would  --  would  --  " He choked , and beat one hand against the other . " I forbid it ! " Elizabeth was faintly sorry for him . " I would n't try , sir . They would n't heed you , and besides it might make real trouble . They 're discontented as it is . " The rector knew that this was true . Church attendance had fallen off sharply since Winthrop left , and Mr. Leigh 's exhortationshad met with taunts and insult . He threw her a look of thwarted anger , cried , " Surely God wo n't permit this outrage in my parish , " and scurried out across the fields for the parsonage to muster what forces he could . Oh dear , thought Elizabeth , but she was determined to let nothing cloud the exciting day . And it was a day long remembered in Groton . A day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A day of dancing . Goody Vintener had unearthed the gilded crown and long colored streamers for the Maypole  --  they had lain hidden in her attic for nearly thirty years  --  and everyone danced around the great painted oaken shaft , weaving and skipping the ribbons . They had morris dancers too , all fitted out with jingling bells ; and the ballads of Robin Hood . There were booths with simple fairings , sweetmeats , buckles and rosettes . On the little stage a wandering juggler who had been found starvingin Hadleigh gave a puppet show that had the Devil himself in it doing obscene and shocking things , but everyone roared and asked for it again  --  even Martha and the sedate Mary , who at first had tried to hide her eyes . Both girls had crept nervously out from the Manor House as the music started , and both had been too fascinated to leave . Something came over them all that day , something from the ancient soil which had known scenes like this before the Romans came , and through the centuries thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were no longer sober godly folk who yearned for salvation , they grew wild as their ancestorsbefore them with the spring-magic of the May . All but the rector , his wife and five of his faithful flock who huddled in the parsonage , shuddering at the debauched sounds they heard across the fields , and praying the Lord to strengthen them for righteous battle . Afternoon came and the glee grew louder . Elizabeth donatedp145a butt of sack from the Manor . And the young swains brought a chair all decked with greens and flowering cherry , which they set upon the stage . " Now the Queen ! " shouted old Kembold , hoarsely . He was well flown with ale and acted as master of ceremonies because he best remembered how it used to be . " We maun have a Queen o ' the May ! " This was greeted with huzzahs , and a babble of nominations . " Wait , men ! " shouted Pond , the miller exuberantly , leaping to the stage . " Who best fur Queen but our own Bess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Moind your manners , Pond ! " cried the Manor baker , shocked at this boozy disrespect , but Elizabeth was touched . " I thank you , goodman  --  " she called from her place near the Maypole , " But I could not . You all know why I can not . " Indeed , for some time she had been aware of a dull backache and nausea , which she ignored . They all cheered her , and God-blessed her , while other voices rose in favor of Peggy , or Thomasine , or Doll . Wat Vintener even yelled for Sally , who gobbled and blushed with pride . But Pond had his own ideas which sprang from confused gratitudeand feudal loyalty . " If not Mistress Bess  --  " he shouted over the hubbub , " then her sister , Martha  --  she 's fair enough , lads . Oi say we 'll have little Mattie Fones ! " " Oh no ! " cried Martha in a panic , but the crowd roared approval . Two husky young farmers rushed forward and seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat her on it . They put a crown of daisies on her head and loosened her hair until it flowed in a rippling chestnut mass down to her waist . And they kissed her , crying , " She 's our queen , our nut-brown maiden ! We will love her for aye ! " Martha gasped and protested , but as they circled around and drank to her , gradually a look of shining wonder came into her eyes , and a smile to her lips . She glanced instinctively at Elizabeth who was laughing and clapping her hands , then at poor Mary Winthropwhom nobody had thought to choose . " Thank you  --  " she said breathlessly . " Thank you all . I 'm so happy to be your queen . " " Then dance with us , Your Majesty ! " cried Pond , his moon face beaming . He raised his hand to help her off the stage . And Martha danced , danced with all of them whirling and floating like a wood sprite , her small face aglow under the daisy wreath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Matt should always be , freed to a childlike gaiety . I have crushed out that miserable jealousy forever , Elizabeth thought with a reso/lution that seemed easy  --  I 'll never feel it more . She accepted a mug of sack from old Kembold , drank a little and regretted it , for it sat uneasily on her stomach . She longed to lie down but could not bear to go . The shadows were lengthening on the lawn , and the light grew more green and golden . While Martha and many of the young people still danced , some couples slipped away to the shielding hedgerows , or behind the dovecote and stables . Two lads began wrestling under a walnut tree , others ringed themselves around two fighting cocks , and Kembold suddenly bethought him of a pastime of his youth . " A duel , a duel ! " he shrilled happily , his grizzled locks flying . " Lad , fetch me little ould quarterstaff  --  " he commanded a grandson who rushed off . " Now who 'll go me a round wi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye ould whinnier , " cried John Rice , the master shepherd , " and break thy pate as I ever did ! " Kembold responded with a jeer . The stout oaken poles were brought . The thatcher and the shepherd fortified themselves with draughts of sack , the dancing stopped and the cockfighters joined the circle around the two old men , who began warily crashing and feinting with their long staves , until with increasing tempo they began to flail wildly . It was this moment that Mr. Leigh chose to come stalking around the edge of a booth shouting , " Halt ! Halt ! I command it ! Stop this disgrace ! " The rector had stumbled over an intertwinedcouple in the fields which added to the indignation some drinks of claret had finally spurred to action . His followers lurked nervously behind him . As the duelers did not hear him , he rushed up to Kembold and grabbed his arm . " Cease ! ' T is the Sabbath Eve ! " The old thatcher turned with a roar of rage . " Ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning ! " And he fetched the rector a great clout on the head with the quarterstaff . Mr. Leigh fell backwards on the turf , and was still . Dear God  --  thought Elizabeth as she hurried forward . Wny did he interfere  --  there was nothing wrong until he made it . She tried to bend down and examine the rector , but the Boxford barber forestalled her . " he 'll be all roight , ma'am . . . " he said , feeling Leigh 's head , " leastways he 's not dead . See his lids flicker . " The crowd , which had drawn around murmuring , heaved a long sigh . Kembold , wagging his head , muttered feebly , " He shouldna 've touched me , he shouldna 've  --  " " Ye 're in trouble , ould man , " said Pond very low . Of the fivep147men who had accompanied the vicar , two were missing . " They 've gone for the constable . " The thatcher gasped and his dirty face paled . " They 'll hang me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn not far from his victim . " Naw , naw  --  " said the shepherd . " Vicar 's opened his eyes . " The rector stirred , put his hand to his head and stammered , " What happened ? " " An accident , " said Elizabeth firmly . " Lie there , while we get bandages from my surgery . Look after him , Mary and Martha  --  " she said to the girls . " And remember  --  " Elizabeth added in a carrying voice , " if anyone asks , it was an unfortunate accident . " " God bless ye , " said Kembold looking up at her with tears in his bleary eyes . " I must go in now , " said Elizabeth aside to Martha . " I feel ill . But I think we should have a last song , " she cried to Pond . " Can you all sing The Maytime Carol ? " For she could n't bear the lovely day to end like this in fear and confusion . They obeyed her , softly and tentatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plaintive ancient melody . " How beautiful May and its morning came in ! The songs of the maidens we heard them begin To sing the old ballads while cowslips they pull While the dew of the morning fills many pipes full ... " When the constable came from Boxford , they were still singing and he found it hard to believe the horrified accounts he had been given of debauchery and murder , especially as the vicar was sitting up , and not dead at all , though somewhat addled in his wits . As for Elizabeth she hauled herself up the stairs in the Manor and went to Margaret 's room , where Goody Hawes was rocking the whimpering baby . The midwife put up a warning finger and went to forestall Elizabeth at the door . " Mistress Winthrop sleeps  --  " she whispered , " Though ' t is a wonder with the racket there 's been outside all day  --  Ah  --  ? " She put the infant in its cradle and peered hard through the dimming light . " So , ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd best get ye to bed . " " ' T is naught so bad , " said Elizabeth faintly . " Only I think my back will break in two . I expect it 'll be over soon . " " Ha ! " said Goody Hawes without the least conviction . " We 'll hope so , you 're built for a good breeder . " But she had sensed trouble as soon as she arrived at the Manor and examined thep148younger woman . Her fat sensitive little hands had assisted at a thousand births , and they could guess many things from the shape and feel of the belly . That little one in there 's a-coming bottom side up , or I 'm a Welshman , she said to herself , we 're in for a bit of work , we are . And so it proved . All that night and the next day and half the next night , Elizabethlabored . The pains came in whirlpools  --  blood-red , streaked with black , they came as grinding knives , as fire , they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream and wondered what the noise was ; exhausted at times she fell into stupor . Frightenedfaces swam past her bed , Martha 's , Mary 's , Sally 's , and at one time Mr. Leigh with a bandage on his head , who said , " My poor child , I fear you must prepare for death , have you made your peace with your Maker ? " " Go away  --  you fool ! " she screamed through bared teeth . " Alwaysyou interfere ! " Then Goody Hawes came with a cup of poppy juice and she slept a little before it began again . She did not think of Harry . She did not think of Jack . She was alone with this monstrous thing that clutched and rent and would destroy her . But once as the second evening advanced towards midnight , she whimpered for her mother . Soon after that , she felt a gentle hand on her clammy forehead , and a voice full of pitying tendernesssaid , " Bess dear  --  my poor Bess . Be brave a little longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened her eyes to see Margaret 's woeful haggard face looking down at her . " You should n't be from bed , " Elizabeth whispered . " Nay  --  think not of that , " said Margaret smoothing the damp hair . " But pray , darling . Pray with me . " Elizabeth could n't pray but she followed the sound of Margaret'svoice and knew a moment of surcease . I will not die , I 'll not give up , she thought in some far-off realm where the pain did not reach . At midnight the physician arrived from Hadleigh , consultedhastily with Goody Hawes , ripped off his cuffs , rolled up his sleeves and took a small iron instrument from his pouch . Monday morning at one o'clock Elizabeth was delivered of a baby girl . ' When Jack arrived from London on the Friday , Elizabeth 's strong twenty-year-old body had nearly recovered and when he came in with Martha to see her , Elizabeth was sitting up in bed nursing her baby , a dreamy smile on her red lips . She wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the brocaded coverlet . " Greetings , Jack  --  " she said from the remote fastness of a blissful preoccupation . Suckling was to her a sensualp149joy from the first . " See my babe ? She 's still a mite puffy and askew from the fearful time she had a-birthing , but Goody Hawes says she 's sound as a trivet . " Jack swallowed , discomfited by her almost ethereal beauty , as well as by the fullness and whiteness of the blue-veined breast at which the baby tugged avidly . He had been deeply shocked at the accounts of her danger , shocked also though in different degree by the rector whose head was still lumped and who met Jack in Boxfordwith a lurid relation of the scandalous happenings on May Day , climaxed by Elizabeth 's insufferable rudeness and virtual blasphemy when the rector , exercising Christian forgiveness , had gone to prepare her for death . Elizabeth was certainly too headstrongand irreligious , Jack had thought , and meant to tax her , as his father would have done . But when he saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He inspected the baby , which seemed to him remarkably ugly though its abundance of light fuzz prompted the only remark he could think of . " ' Twill be like Harry , no doubt . " " Aye , " she said , kissing a tiny wrinkled fist . " Poor Harry , he was sure of a boy . . . but next time ... " " Oh , Bess  --  " cried Martha , staring at her sister . " How can you speak of that  --  so  --  so calmly ? " Still Martha heard in nightmaresthe echoes of Elizabeth 's screams , still saw how she had looked with face like a clay death 's head  --  and the disgusting smell of blood . " " T is over and forgot , " said Elizabeth smiling . She shifted the replete baby and covered her breast , then looked at jack and Martha . " She 'll be baptized Sunday of course ? Will Mr. Leigh do it or is he too angry with me ? " The green twinkle of mirth shone in her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell him to , " answered Jack . " I wish you two to be godparents , please . " Elizabeth gave them both a look of purest affection from which all baseness had been purged by agony , and now the bliss , of motherhood . Jack suddenly realized that Martha was there , clinging to his arm . He patted the childish hand and said quickly , " We 'll be honored , wo n't we , Matt dear ? " The girl nodded looking up into his lean brown face , and Elizabeth thought , They are alike these two in feature , I never saw it before because Martha 's so small . " I wish the baby christened Martha Johanna for you both , " she said . Martha reddened with pleasure . " Oh Bess , TWO names for such a wee scrap ! "  |p150Elizabeth  nodded . Her eyes met Jack 's in a fleeting glance that said , And thus we will always be reminded by my babe of the barrier between us . " We 'll soon need Mr. Leigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattie ? " he said , putting his arm around the girl . " As soon as we hear of my father 's safe arrival in Massachusetts I 'll write to him and tell him we 've waited long enough . " On Saturday , the 12th of June , the Arbella having been nine stormy weeks at sea slid along the southern coast of Cape Ann and sighted journey 's end at last ; the collection of bark huts and sodroofdugouts which the Indians called Naumkeag , but the settlement'stemporary governor , John Endecott , had rechristened Salem . The air was fresh and sparkling with a whitish light unlike the golden mists of England , a land breeze brought the eager passengersthe fragrance of pines and wild strawberries . They were crowded on the decks , exclaiming , cheering , and some weeping , as the Arbella ran up the Royal Ensign and shot off two salutes to alert those on shore . John Winthrop stood with the gentry on the poop deck . They had all donned their finest clothes , just unpacked by their servants . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braid . His ruff was edged two inches deep with Mechlin lace . His hat though unplumed was garnished with gilt band and buckle . Across his chest a baldric of red , silver and blue , the royal colors , supported an impressive sword of state . On a stool beside him in an elaborate padlocked box , reposed the precious charter . John saw a shallop put out from the flimsy-looking dock on shore and knew it contained Endecott , because Captain Peirce of the Lyon had gone to fetch the supplanted governor . " How happy they 'll be to see us ! " cried the Lady Arbella , leaning against the rail in her rustling blue taffeta dress , " and to know we 've brought the Charter ! " Winthrop bowed to her and smiled . His heart swelled with pride and thanksgiving . " Praise God that we have come here safe ! " he cried impulsively , " and that it seems such a fair goodly country . " They all assented : Lady Arbella , Isaac Johnson , and Thomas Dudley who stood slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boston merchant , William Coddington , stood together with the other Company assistants , Sir Richard Saltonstall , and Increase Nowell , all gazing with excitement at the shore.  | " 0 Give thanks unto the Lord , for He hath led his children to the Land of Canaan , where milk and honey flow , " said Phillips solemnly . But it very soon developed that neither milk nor honey flowed at Salem . When Endecott and his minister , Mr. Skelton , had boarded the Arbella they were sparing of their welcome speeches , nor had Endecott bothered to change a stained leather jerkin and frayed shirt . He made slight obeisance to the new governor who ousted him , and seemed preoccupied as he invited Winthrop and the principal gentlemen on shore . As soon as they had landed , Endecott led the way up a muddy path to a one-and-a-half-room timber house floored with packed earth , which was the largest Salem afforded . " ' T is the best we have , " he said in answer to Dudley 's look of dismay . Endecott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a forked grizzled beard and a grim fanatical eye which never softened . He was a man who did his duty and had a horror of episcopacy so intense that even Winthrop was startled . Conferencewith Endecott , and Salem 's two ministers , Skelton and Higginson , soon showed John that Salem 's religious views had in two years grown far closer to those of the Separatists at Plymouth than to the reforming Anglican spirit Winthrop and his company professed . But there were more critical matters even than religion to be dealt with . Endecott fed Winthrop and his assistants a good venison pasty and some beer , and when they expressed their thanks , said " Aye , ' t is a change from sea fare , but not to mince matters , Sir Governor , that 's the end of it . We 're well nigh starving here , and you mus n't think to stay . We ca n't feed our own , and now you tell me you 've scant provision left . You must find some other part of the Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I intended to , " said Winthrop stiffly after a moment . " We 'll set off down the coast at once . I see you 've no room here . " " We 've sickness too , " said Endecott . " There 's not three sound folk in my town ; if they 're not coughing and sweating , they 're puking and purging , and a fair lot of ' em want to go back to Englandwhen your ships leave . " " You 're something gloomy , Mr. Endecott , " said Isaac Johnson , his fresh boyish face darkening . " I trust you 're not of those who would leave . " Endecott shrugged his massive shoulders . " I 've no love for England . I 'll do my best here , if I 'm spared . But you 'll find it naught so easy to settle in this devil-scourged wilderness . "  | " Nevertheless  --  " said Winthrop rising , and putting on his hat , " I intend to do so . " He bowed and walked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arbella . On the 6th of July , John Winthrop sat in his private bark wigwam at Charlestown on the Mystic River , writing home-bound letters for which Captain Peirce , Master of the Lyon , was waiting . It was hot in the hastily built wigwam , but hotter yet outside , where the sun glared clown as it had for days , and never did in England . John wiped his face on a small linen towel , and tried to marshal his thoughts . There was a crowd of people milling as usual outside , desirous of interviews ; some were discontented settlers who were tired of existing on mussels , wild berries and Indian corn , and many had constant belly gripes which Charlestown'sbrackish water augmented . There were also four Indians whose frame of mind was not yet apparent except that they felt they owned the land hereabouts , and wished to know how long the English intended to camp here in their Mishawam . Two of these Indians were called John and James Sagamore , and with them was the chief of the Neponsetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but red or yellow paint , turkey feathers in their scalplocks , and deerskin breechclouts . The fourth Indian was oddly enough a forceful woman , known as Squaw Sachem . She had a string of the valuable purple wampum around her thick neck , owned considerable land , and gave herself airs . All four squatted outside the wigwam , peeringcuriously at the scowling English , and greedily guzzling the precious beer Winthrop had ordered his servants to give them . John clipped his pen and wrote on . Just within the canvas door Captain William Peirce , ablest of all the master mariners , stood gazing out to sea while he smoked his pipe and wished the Governorwould hurry with the letters . The Lyon must set forth at once if she were to fetch the provisions from England so urgently needed , and return before the winter storms began . And I know not what the poor gawks 'll do whilst I 'm gone , Peirce thought , looking at the Governor with pity . The English did not seem to be able to live off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artisans in the fleet were poor huntsmen too . Many of Winthrop 's company were sick of the scurvy and flux , the water supply at Charlestown was poor . It was obvious , as the ships straggled in , that so many people could not exist on this barren peninsula . Already Sir Richard Saltonstall and the minister , George Phillips , had gone up the Charles and found ap153new location which Sir Richard called Watertown . While Isaac Johnson had rowed across the river to explore the queer threehilledpeninsula called Shawmut , where lived  --  they said  --  a mad or eccentric Englishman who was probably bewitched , . In truth I believe they 're all bewitched , Peirce thought , to leave their good homes and risk their lives in this heathen wilderness . But that was none of his business  --  his was to ferry them across in his staunch little Lyon , a job which he had done excellently for seven years now . He straightened , suddenly peering over the heads of the squatting Indians . " Ship 's just ' ove in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising his head . Each day since arrival at Charlestown the ships had been coming , after touching at Salem for directions . The Mayflower , the Whale , the Hopewell , the Trial , the Success , the William and Francis , and at each landing Winthrop had questioned the passengers about Harry . Will Pelham from the Mayflower told where he 'd last seen him in Southampton , but that was all . " ' T is the Talbot , sir ! " said Captain Peirce triumphantly , knowinghow eagerly Winthrop awaited this particular ship which was long overdue . Winthrop jumped up and stood in the doorway beside Peirce . " ' Er flag also is at half-mast , " Peirce added sadly . There had been deaths on nearly all the ships , not only human deaths but what had come to seem almost as bad since it imperiled those who survived  --  heavy loss of cattle , the precious cows , sheep and goats which were to start the new stock , and supply food through the winter . Winthrop returned to his letters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked his first impulse to rush down to the shore . If Harry were indeed on board he was not to be forgiven so easily . Captain Peirce went off followed by the Indians , who were still fascinated by these monstrous white-winged floating birds , and soon joined by the Winthrop lads , Stephen and Adam , who were equally attracted by the Indians . Winthrop wrote on to Margaret : Blessed be the Lord , our good God and mercifull father , that hath yet preserved me in life and health to salute thee , and to comfort thy longing heart , with the joyful news of my well f are , and the well f are of thy beloved children ... " when he heard a low , shocked murmur of voices outside , and the heavy tread of measured footsteps.  |p154He  put his pen down and waited , while his heartbeats slowed . A black-haired soldier in a cuirass stepped through the doorway , saying , " By your leave , Your Worship . " He held his helmet against his chest and bowed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service according to the agree-ment . " " Ah yes , Captain , welcome . You came on the Talbot ? And Captain Daniel Patrick ? And your wives ? " " They are all here . " Underhill usually had a handsome mobile face quick to laugh or frown , and was something of a dandy with small clipped mustache and pomaded hair . But now he was unshaven , his hair unkempt , and his dark eyes held only a painful reluctance . " Your Worship , I have bad news  --  " he said staring at the earthen floor . Winthrop 's hand tightened on the pen . " You lost many on the Talbot ? " " Fourteen at sea , sir  --  and  --  and one other . " " One other  --  " repeated Winthrop in a whisper . The pen dropped and rolled off the table . " You mean something , Captain , " he said steadily . " Who was this other ? " The Captain glanced at his governor , and back to the floor . " Your son Henry  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've known that I must say so . We were fond of him , Patrick and I. He was a fine lad . " Winthrop drew a sharp breath , and bowed his head on his clenched fists . Underhill heard the low sounds of stifled prayer , and though he was no man for religion his eyes misted . Harry 's death had been so sudden and so senseless ; they had stood like stones , he and Patrick , on the riverbank , helpless as it happened , though both had rushed in later for the grappling . " How was it ? " asked the Governor in a wooden voice . " Four days ago , sir , when we touched at Salem , it was mortal hot . We went for a bit of stroll along the North River , and across it saw one of these Indian canoes . Master Harry , he was merry at being on land , and he laughed and said ' t was like some the Caribs had at Barbadoes . I 'll get it for us ! ' he cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one of us to swim , having learned in the Indies . He would n't listen to us . He plunged in as he was , except for his boots , and we thought he 'd make it  --  but the water was cold , and he overhot . " Underhill paused . " Overhot with brandy too ... " murmured Winthrop closing his eyes . " Oh , my son Henry , my son Henry  --  poor child  --  " His voice broke.  |p155Underhill  turned away . " He sank like a plummet , sir , in the middle of the river . . . but later  --  too late  --  we found him . " " You 've brought him here then . . . ? " The Captain nodded slowly and gestured towards . the outside . Winthrop lifted the canvas flap and saw the raw pine box resting on the ground beside a sandy bank of scrub oak . " Thank you , Captain , " said Winthrop . " I know you did what you could . . . find and bring to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and tell  --  tell the Indians I will receive them presently . " John Winthrop did not finish his letter to his wife . He wrote instead to Emmanuel Downing by the Lyon , and held Margaret 's letter for another ship . It was on Michaelmas Day , September 29 , that Emmanuel Downing and his manservant trotted through Boxford , noting despite the melancholy of their journey that the church was being decorated for the Harvest Festival . Lads and lasses were nailing sheaves of grains upon the door , a cartful of garden stuff and fruit was drawn up by the lych gate , awaiting ornamental distribution along the nave and through the chancel . As Downing pursued the road to Groton , he encountered a procession of tenants plodding towards the Manor with their rents  --  many of them in kind ; lambs , fat geese , barrels of apples or sacks of barley . At least the harvest 's been good he thought , no matter the other trials ,  --  which included Winthrop 's mounting debts . And the Manor , through some legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet sold . A bungling matter , thought his brother-in-law sighing and reining in his horse , for all John 's training he had scant head for business . And yet a stubborn man of vision who let naught daunt him . Downing turned his horse through the Manor gates and saw a happy party on the lawn . Everyone in the house was nutting , as was the custom on this day . The manservants flailed and shook the four magnificent walnut trees that stood near the garden well , while the children and maids capered beneath , gathering the crop in sacks , cracking and eating as many as they gathered . Martha , Mary and Elizabeth were also nutting , and Emmanuel paused to admire . The three girls made a charming picture of youth in their bright-colored clothes  --  especially Elizabeth in a new saffron gown , girdled tight around a waist even slenderer than it used to be , though her bosom was fuller , and her skirt kilted up like a milkmaid 's showed off her pretty ankles . Downing stared at her appreciatively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her black ringlets . Poor lass , he thought , mindful of his tragic errand  --  ah well  --  she 'll have no trouble finding the next one . He dismounted heavily , having grown stouter of late , and walked to the bench by the garden well where Margaret was placidly mending linen while she kept an eye on the two babies in their cradles . She rose to meet him with a cry of delighted astonishment . " Why , Brother Downing , what brings you here from London to our great pleasure ? " She had no thought of trouble , because Forth , still in Exeter , had written that a ship at Bristol had brought news of the Governor 's safe landing with all his party . The whole family had held Thanksgiving in Groton Church . " You 've brought letters , at last ? " she cried , her plum face glowing . " We so long for them ! " " A letter  --  " said Downing slowly , and at her sudden look of alarm , added , " Oh , Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , but  --  " he glanced at the nutting party which had not yet noticed him  --  " where 's Jack ? " he asked , shrinking from his task and knowing that his nephew 's notable tact might make it easier . " Receiving rents in the hall , I believe , or physicking one of the horses  --  he has so much to do  --  and I do n't know how we 'd manage without him  --  but what is it , Brother ? " " A heavy blow , " said Emmanuel , sitting down beside her , and resigning himself . " ' T is Harry . " Margaret flinched and put down her linen . " He 's disappeared ? " she said , " Or is it disgrace . . . ? " " Drowned , " he stated flatly . He fumbled in his pocket and brought out his pipe , stuffed it with tobacco , made a great play with the flint until lie got it lit , while she stared at him , and her gentle eyes filled with scalding tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . " Oh , my poor Bess . " She looked at the girl 's laughing face as she played a game of catch with the walnuts , tossing them to the enraptured little Deane . " You 'd best read the letter , " said Emmanuel , giving it to her . " John is so brave , " Margaret murmured , wiping her eyes as she finished . " You see how staunchly he takes this  --  " She quoted from the letter : " Let us join in praising our mercifull God that howsoever he hath Afflicted us , both generally and particularly mine own family in his stroke upon my son Henry , yet my selfe and the rest of our children and f amilye are safe and in health , and that he upholds our heartes that we faint not in all our troubles , but can yet wait for a good issue . . . Besides in this ,  |p157that  God begins with us thus in Affliction , it is the greater argumentto us of his love ... " " Aye  --  " agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of John 's other sons , particularly Jack , God 's personalaffliction might not have been so well borne . " He speaks , too , so tenderly of Bess , " continued Margaret , " sayingit grieves him so much for her . The Lord strengthen and comfort her heart to beare this cross patiently  --  ' It will comfort her , I know , that John is so pitiful of her , and has come , I believe , to see her worth as I have . " " No doubt . " Emmanuel puffed on his pipe and shook his head . " All the same I 'd not like to be the one to tell her . " It was Jack who told her that evening . They kept the secret until Elizabeth had eaten the traditional Michaelmas dinner with its great roast geese stuffed with apples and walnuts . She noted that her uncle plied her with wine , and looked at her with special tenderness , but then she knew she had always been a favorite of his . They waited until she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk . Margaret 's milk had given out long since , and Elizabeth , having an abundance , offered to suckle the puny little Ann as well as her own , whereupon Ann began to thrive though never as big and healthy as Martha Johanna , whom Elizabeth called Joan . From sure instinct , Jack called Elizabeth outside into the garden , knowing that the flowers and the old mulberry tree she loved might help sustain her , as would the concealment provided by the evening shadows , for she was proud  --  and for all the strength of her passions , tried to conceal them . He told her very gently , holding her hand in his , while his voice thickened , and moisture stung his lids . She was quiet a long time after he had finished , clinging hard to his hand and leaning against the gnarled old mulberry trunk . Then she whispered , " Peyto knew it was coming  --  he saw it . " Jack did not understand and thought her dazed . " Perhaps I knew too , " she went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in the blue cloak  --  I felt  --  I remembered Peyto  --  " " Bess , dear , " he interrupted softly . " I 've not the faith my father has , but we must believe , we do believe that you two will meet hereafter . " " Harry died as he lived . . . " she said in a thin remote voice . " Merry , confident and strong in his own whims  --  ' t is not so bad a way . " Jack was silent . Perhaps it was not so bad a way . He thought ofp158his brother , who would now be forever young and golden-haired , whose faults would be forgotten  --  while otherwise  --  what unhappinessmight there not have been for Bess ? But she 's free now , he thought with a blinding flash of pain and dismay . She 's free , and I am not . The marriage to Martha was arranged for next week , though now would be postponed of course since the Manor would be plunged into mourning . Yet even were he free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of scriptural law . Jack 's hand trembled on Elizabeth 's and he checked these riotous thoughts with shame . " Shall I leave you now , dear , " he said quickly . " You 'll like to be alone perhaps . " " Aye . . . " she answered after a while . " Perhaps . " Her hand went to the gaudy brooch Harry had given her ; she unfastened it and held it , staring at the crystals and false gold . " ' T is all I have of Harry , now  --  " she said with a strained wonder , " except my Joan . " And the memory of one completely happy day  --  long ago in London.  |p159THE  AFFLICTIONS suffered by the Winthrops did not cease with Harry 's death . In November , Forth came home to Groton after his long visit at Exeter , where he had fallen in love . He was full of plans for his marriage , and the whole family 's eventual voyage to New England . Somehow on the journey between Devonshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into lung fever . He took to his bed with an excruciating pain behind the ribs and a barking cough that distressed them all , but did not alarm them until the 25th of November when he suddenly grew delirious and the sound of his agonized breathing seemed to fill the house . Elizabeth searched frantically through her father 's receipt book for new concoctions which might help , they sent a groom gallopingfor the Hadleigh physician , they got the barber to bleed him , the women rushed to and fro with warming pans for his clammy feet , or steaming cloths for his chest . All to no avail . Forth died that night , within five weeks of his twenty-first birthday . " It is the Lord 's Will , the Lord 's Will . . . " moaned Margaret . " God give us grace to make use of this new stroke He has visited on us ! But I know not how to write of it to John ! " She gathered her own little Sammy fearingly in her arms , and broke down completelyfor some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow around her heart . God 's purposes were doubtless inscrutable to humans , and Death might be only a Dark Angel , but she found no comfort in this . She felt instead a great resentmentagainst God , and a blasphemous wonder whether He indeed concerned Himself so closely with mortals unless it was to mock and punish . And after Forth 's funeral she kept much to herself , finding pleasure only in the baby , as it had been since she heard of Harry 's death.  |p160And  yet through the winter as Margaret read her parts of John Winthrop 's letters , Elizabeth felt grudging admiration and some envy for the unvarying fortitude he showed in bearing not only his family losses but the continual tragedies which were occurring in Massachusetts . He stated these baldly enough , and without comment . In the three months since the landing of the fleet , nearly a third of his company had died . The Lady Arbella survived but a month and died in Salem , her husband Isaac Johnson lost heart without her , and by October he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had himself named Boston . Salem 's minister , Francis Higginson , died . Mrs. George Phillips died in Watertown . Mrs. William Coddington died . Mr. Rossiter died , and Mr. Gager , their only physician , died . Winthrop lost twelve from amongst his own servants ' families . There was smallpox , sweating sickness and sudden fevers . Too , almost everyone had scurvy , and it was noted that those who yearned " and lingered after England , " bemoaning their folly in having come , died fastest of all . And yet Winthrop wrote staunchly to Margaret : Thou maiest see the goodnesse of the Lord towards me , that when so many have dyed , and many yet languishe , my sel-fe and my children are yet living and in health . . . we conceivethat this disease grewe from ill diet at sea and proved infectious . I write not this to discourage thee , but to warne thee and others to provide well for the sea and by Godes helpe the passage wilbe safe and easy .. . And he sent detailed directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters Margaret had often nourished the craven hope that John might yet give up and return home . Sometimes she would even talk to the little round miniature of him he had given her . It had been painted in London and was an excellent likeness . Margaret weeping over the ivory disk would implore John to come home , though she never did in her letters . And she could not help but be grievously affected by dark whisperingsamongst Groton 's Manor folk who interpreted all these deaths as showing God 's curse upon the move . Pond , the miller , one spring day received a letter from his son in Massachusetts , and being unable to decipher it , carried it to Margaret whom he found in the courtyard hurrying from the bakehouse . Pond , agog over his letter , had come straight fromp161the mill and was powdered with flour from his wool cap to his huge boots . " Would ye be so koind , Mistress ? " he said tendering the letter anxiously . Young Pond 's year at the Boxford grammar school had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missive with growing dismay at its contents . I knowe , Lovinge father ...

Then Pond spoke heavily . " So he 's coming home  --  is he ! And would a saved me a purseful had he listened in the first place . But Oi 'm glad he 's aloive as yet , there 's plenty went from here who are n't . " " I know  --  " said Margaret turning away . " I know . Why did your son go , Pond ? " she said after a moment . " It would seem not for spiritual reasons . " " No more it was , " said the miller , shrugging . " He went tew better hisself , the dom chucklehead , he 'd dreams o ' free land an ' lazy living , of setting up as squoire , no doubt . Thass why he went , but glad enough now tew come home and help me wi ' the mill . The young fule . " Margaret sighed , and handed back the letter , which the miller tucked under his floury blue smock . " Write the Governor , Mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell him ye feel ' t is a sign he 's mistaken God 's bidding  --  all the troubles there 's been  --  and his own two sons dead so fast loike a judgment . . . all of us here mourn Master Harry and Master Forth as our own ! " " He does not see it so , " she replied with difficulty . She pulled John 's latest letter from her bosom . " Listen what he writes  --   |p162I  prayse God , that the Lord will abundantly recompence for all the trouble we have endured . . . we heer enjoye God and Jesus Christ , is not this enough ? I thanke God I like so well to be heer as I do not repent my coming : and if I were to come again I would not have altered my course , though I had foreseenall these Afflictions .. . " Always he writes thus and urges my going to him quickly with my family . " " Ah  --  " said the miller shaking his head . " A stubborn gentleman  --  if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong . " " He 's NEVER wrong ! " said Margaret sharply . " And I 'm hastening to do as he wishes . The Manor is sold , Pond  --  to a Mr. Waring of London . Everyone will know it soon . And we will sail for New England in August . " The miller 's round face fell into disconsolate lines . " So it 's come . . . " he muttered twisting his hands in his smock . " It 's come . Will ye all be going ? " She nodded with a firmness she did not feel . " Mistress Bess ? " he questioned wistfully . His admiration for Elizabeth had grown even greater since last May Day because she had recently healed a sore on his wife 's breast . " She too , I believe , " said Margaret . " At least she must leave Groton , of course . " " Aye , " said the miller . " There 'll be naught but strangers at the Manor now . And the land do n't loike it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-headed calf been born at Gosling 's , and the gray lady 's walking o ' noights i ' the ruined castle again ! " " I 'm sorry  --  Pond , " said Margaret unhappily as he bobbed his head and walked sadly off . She went in search of Elizabeth who was the only person she could share her fears with . Jack was in London immersed in a hundred activities relative to Bay Company business and their own departure ; besides , since his marriage to Martha on February 8 he had grown extremely restless , impatient of delays and would talk of nothing but New England and its development . Jack 's marriage had partaken of this restless impatience too , since he had suddenly decided on it and given them all scant time for preparation . Though in truth there was little to prepare , with the family in deep mourning . Groton Church had however been decorated with pine boughs and holly over Mr. Leigh 's protests . Martha wore a white gown she had made herself , and the wedding feast in the Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dancing , of which jack was as fond as Martha , and both bride and groom had seemed very happy on that afternoon . Margaret had rejoiced at that , and tried to ignore some doubts later . The new-wedded pair spent their honeymoon at Groton , and except that a large four-poster had been moved into Jack 's room , and Martha shared this with him , it was hard to believe they were married , so little had their usual attitudes towards each other changed . Jack continued to treat his little wife with a somewhat **25;11219;TOOLONG , Martha seemed as adoring , shy and childish as ever , though in her case there was an added stress of embarrassment , and constraint . This would have disturbed Margaret had she not had troubles enough of her own without seeking to analyze subtleties . After the miller 's disturbing visit , Margaret found both sisters in the small wainscoted parlor beside a crackling fire . Elizabeth was lying on the Turkey hearth rug playing with Joan , who now at a year walked a little , investigated everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " milk , " and " no . " She was a plump baby with rosy cheeks , and was gurgling happily while her mother played " This little piggy to market " with her toes . Margaret suppressedthe customary pang that her own baby Ann still showed no interest in anything , but lay quietly in her cradle , gazing upward with wide , vacant eyes . " Bess , " said Margaret , advancing to the fire , " Pond , the miller 's been here , had a letter from that great hobble-de-boy son of his , who is  --  is coming home . He told of yet more deaths out there  --  it was distressing ... " " Oh ? " said Elizabeth sympathetically while rescuing her crystal brooch from Joan 's clutch . " Still you must not let it distress you , my mother  --  since there 's nothing for it  --  but to go . " They both heard the involuntary sound that Martha made . The girl was perched on a stool by old Adam 's desk box , laboriously writing to Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private use , partly to amuse her , and partly because his eager mind was interested in ciphers , as it was in alchemy and medicine and all branches of physical science . Martha had the key to the cipher beside her , but was proud of having nearly learned the numerical symbols , each one of which stood for a letter , and she tried to make her sprawling unformed writing neat . She had been , as she did repeatedly , assuring him of her love , quite unable to explain the dark resistance and fears which had clouded their wedding night and thereafter . That'sp164it  --  she thought  --  as she heard her sister speak . ' T is the prospect of this fearful journey that makes me act so strange with Jack . She dipped her pen , and a great blot of ink slipped off on the paper . She stared at it through hot tears . It would be shame to send him a blotted letter , as so many things were shameful . Shameful as her behavior to him their wedding night when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fighting , sobbing , until at last he turned from her saying in a voice of sad aloofness , " My poor Martha , you need not struggle with me , nor ever fear me . " He had not touched her again except to kiss her lightly now and then as he had always done . She pulled another piece of paper from the box , and started once more in cipher , " Deare husband . " The other women had gone on talking and Margaret said , " Pond asked me if you sailed with us  --  I said I thought so  --  yet Bess dear  --  how I hope that you will make the match with William Coddington  --  John wishes it  --  and it would settle you so well over there ! " Winthrop had twice mentioned William Coddington'sprojected visit to the Manor , and a groom had gone to fetch Coddington from Sudbury this very afternoon . Elizabeth sat up , pushing back her hair which the baby had tumbled . " I wo n't know until I see the man ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about him  --  writing the vicar to inquire about my virtues ! Writing you the same ! And I 've little fancy for a widower , no matter how Uncle John thinks to get me ably off his hands ! " " Bess ! " cried Margaret , noting sadly that Elizabeth had returned of late to the rebellious bravado of her girlhood , but Margaret was staunchly fond of her , and had come to depend on her too . " You speak most unreasonable . You are a widow , and since Mr. Coddingtonhas most unfortunately buried his wife in New England ... " " And is looking for another as fast as possible , and is rich , and is willing to consider me on Uncle John 's recommendation , I should be thanking God for my good fortune ? " Elizabeth burst out in one of her rare laughs at Margaret 's rueful face . " Never mind , dearest Mother . I promise to charm Mr. Coddington if I possibly can . I suppose I must marry , if only to get a man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want more babies . " Margaret shook her head . " I grieve to hear you so flippant  --  did I not know your warm true heart ... " " Warm true hearts profit little , " said Elizabeth gathering upp165Joan . " I will go now and make myself beautiful for Mr. Coddington ! " She spoke pertly , but as she passed the desk where Martha was hunched , she gave her sister an anxious look , knowing well that something was wrong between the new couple , and sorry for them , even though she could not help relief that she had not had to witness raptures . William Coddington duly arrived in time for supper , and Elizabethhad made herself as lovely as the black silk dress and plain mourning collar allowed . She wickedly left off her starched widow 's cap , and twisted her hair into little tendrils around her face . She rubbed some red salve Harry had given her on her lips . She doused herself with rosewater and patted orris-root powder over her neck and arms . Sally was in ecstasies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am , ye dew smell good n ' thass the truth . The gentleman 'll never leave wi'out declaring hisself ! " Elizabeth 's hazel eyes sparkled as she descended the stairs , and her heart beat with an anticipation she had not admitted to Margaret . It would be pleasant to be wooed again , to feel desirable and female . It would be delightful to be kissed , and if Mr. Coddingtonpleased her , she had little doubt that she could kindle passion in him . Fifteen months had passed since she had said farewellto poor Harry , and his image had faded . Recently she had even enjoyed correspondence with Edward Howes , who apparently still wanted her and was making overtures by letter , though she had no intention of allowing him to get serious again . Her awakenedbody yearned for lovemaking after the long abstinence ; she wished for new romance that would release her once and for all from any forbidden preoccupation with Jack . But William Coddington , despite Sally 's prophecy , did leave Groton without declaring himself , for after one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth behaved outrageously . Coddington was no more than thirty but his head was nearly bald , and fringed with straggling locks . He was pock-marked , much shorter than she and very fat . He was stuffed like a sausage into an elegant brocaded doublet and velvet breeches . There were several gold rings on his puffy hands . Bowing , he greeted Elizabeth in tones of measured condescension . " Good evening , Mistress Winthrop , this is a pleasure long desired , I have heard interesting reports of you , and am gratified to see that those of your comeliness at least were not exaggerated  --  " He gave her a smug appraising smile and she noted that his breath was foul from rotted teeth.  | " And I 've heard of you , " she answered , furious with disappointment . " And I observe that perhaps reports of famine in New England are much exaggerated . " She glanced from his plump cheeks to his paunch , but her voice was so soft , and Coddington so sure of his own worth , that he merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe they are , at least it is largely the lower sort of folk who complain . " " I see  --  " she said . " How foolish of them . " Her smile became more brilliant , gliding away from Coddington to rest on young Leigh , the vicar 's eighteen-year-old son , who had just come down from Cambridge . The Leigh family had been asked to supper to meet Mr. Coddington . " Is it not foolish of the lower sort to complain of scanty food  --  Mr. Leigh ? " she said to the young man looking at him through her lashes . He was immediately dazzled , and stammered some fatuousreply . Throughout the supper , Elizabeth flirted with young Leigh , she drank too much claret , she laughed too high , she interrupted Coddington whenever he tried to deliver an opinion . Martha and Mary stared at her in amazement . Had Margaret been there , she might have controlled this madness , but Margaret had excused herself from the supper party because her baby had again developed fever and convulsions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth uncertainly as he watched Elizabeth . He knew himself to be a man of consequence both in Old Boston and the New  --  a most eligible husband . He had however been prepared to overlook the fact that Elizabeth was a mere apothecary 's daughter , prepared even to forget somewhat damaging gossip he had heard about her impetuous marriage to Harry , since her double relationship to Governor Winthrop mitigated these . So undoubtedly did her beauty . He felt himself as powerfully attracted by it , as he was shocked by her hoydenish behavior , which grew worse . After supperElizabeth , sweetly enquiring if she could entertain them , picked up a lute and sang in her true husky voice a ribald tavern song she had learned from Harry . She was presently joined in the chorus by young Leigh despite the rector 's glares . " You do not like my song ? " she asked anxiously in the silence that followed . " Oh , Mr. Coddington , I am so disappointed , for I wished so much to please you . Perhaps this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched into " Cuckolds all in a Row . " Before she had finished , Mr. Leigh rose , signaled his wife and grabbed his son by the arm . " We must be going , " he said in out/raged tones , throwing Coddington a look of commiseration and apology . Elizabeth too looked at Coddington , and was dismayed to see a lustful glint in his small eyes which kept roaming over her neck and bosom . She poured herself more wine to offset a fear  --  the lifelong buried fear of John Winthrop and his wishes . She had defied these once , and dared not do so again by explicitly refusingher uncle 's choice for her . The opportunity must not arise . " Wait , " she cried wildly to the Leighs . " It is yet early , let us play a game of names  --  to see what images they present ! " The Leighs paused , compelled by her vibrancy and force . " My maiden name  --  " she cried , " was Fones  --  that 's easy , since it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  why what a wondrous suggestive name it is ! We think of a great fish , do we not ? We think of little pods , and bags  --  aye , and can we help  --  when viewing so handsome , so virile an owner of the name , " she paused , went on with silken malice , " Can we help think of a codpiece ? " Coddington drew in a hissing breath . His pride of name was as great as his physical deficiency in the area to which Elizabeth so monstrously referred . He threw her a look of fury , and said with considerable dignity , " Your game is a poor one , Mistress Winthrop , and I perceive that you have drunk to excess . I shall return to Sudbury if you will kindly have the horses brought . " It was some days before her baby recovered and Margaret heard of that evening from the rector . She went straight in search of Elizabeth who was working in her surgery looking pale and drawn . " Oh , Bess , how COULD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stool and gazing woefully at the girl . " What Mr. Coddington must think  --  and will tell John ! " " He 'll not tell much , " said Elizabeth slowly pounding cardamonseeds in her mortar . " Except that he found me unsuitable , ' t is better that way . You scarce saw him  --  he was  --  was  --  " she shuddered , " like a bloated toad , and yet Uncle John would have had me marry him . " " Men think not of the looks of other men , " said Margaret helplessly . " And my John is best judge of what 's good for you and all of us . Bess , he is your guardian , your uncle and your father , you MUST obey him . " Aye , thought Elizabeth , and he has my dowry too , my four hundred pounds which he said he would repay but has not yet.  |p168Dear  God , that I were born a man , and could strike out alone  --  with Joan . " And , in your behavior you most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastening on another unhappy aspectof the rector 's account . " For that I 'm sorry , " said Elizabeth dully . " I was high-flown with wine . " " May God correct and guide you , my poor child , " sighed Margaretrising with difficulty for she had remained heavy after Ann 's birth , and her leg veins were swollen . " I pray all the time that you will be touched with His sure grace . " Elizabeth put down her pestle . She bent and kissed the older woman . " I would be like you if I could , my mother , but I can not . " On August 15 of that summer , 1631 , the Winthrops arrived at Sandwich in Kent to await Captain Peirce and his ship Lyon , which had been laden at Gravesend and was sailing down the Thames and around Kent to pick them up before continuing the voyage to New England . Mr. John Humphrey , who was married to Arbella 's sister , Lady Susan , had kindly placed a house he owned in Sandwich at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but though it was a goodly Tudor mansion near the Guildhall the Winthrop party was so large that some must stay at the Fleur-de-Lys , which enchanted Elizabeth who insisted on being of that number . The Inn was small and musty , the beds none too well aired but it was gay , the taproom filled with jovial drinkers , the courtyard always a-bustle with travelers and sailors , and passengers like themselves , who meant to embark from the Downs . And at the Inn one could better smell the sea . Elizabeth had been bred iii London and the gentle countryside , and was fond of both . Yet from her first glimpse of the distant line of breakers on the Sandwich Flats , she felt a compelling new thrill . Let the rest of them , Margaret , Martha and Mary , weep for Groton , as they did that night , Elizabeth could not join them . She suffered nothing but relief and anticipation . The Winthrops had brought four servants , amongst them Sally , who had decided to emigrate with Elizabeth when Wat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in Sally 's charge and escaped into the warm summer twilight , heading through the quaint windingstreets for the sea . The sea was retreating from this town that had once been the chiefest of the Cinque-Ports , but a short walk brought her to the wide brown sands , where she stood trans/fixed , gazing with awe at the crashing breakers , the flying spume , the suck and power of the watery masses , ever striving , pounding , ebbing , indifferent and beautiful . " Ah  --  " she breathed , stretching wide her arms into the saltsweetwind . She walked so near the marge that one wave greater than the rest swirled round her ankles , and she laughed . " So , Bess  --  you laugh ? " said a quizzical voice behind her . She turned and saw Jack standing on the sand . Some of her own exultanceshowed in his eyes . " The sea , " he said , " pathway to the New World . " " To freedom , " she answered , throwing back her head . They looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked himself . " I guessed where to find you , for it 's where I would come too . There 's news . The Lyon was sighted passing Ramsgate earlier . She 'll soon be in the Downs with this wind . We may leave tomorrow . " " I 'm glad  --  " she cried . " Glad ! " " Not afraid ? " " Only of your father , I think . Of nothing else . " He started to say that she need n't be , that his father was wise and essentially kind , that in any case she was but an inexperienced girl of twenty-one and must be guided . Instead he said , without wishing to , " Hattie is afraid . " " I know . " Elizabeth pulled her gaze from the waves . " She does n't want to go . " She hesitated . " Why ca n't you reassure her , Jack ? What is there wrong between you two ? She loves you so much . " " Martha is a child , " he said roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were alone on the beach , and plunged unsuspecting into an intimacy they had never permitted before . The gulls wheeled and mewed , heading inland towards the town . The sky turned violet and the waves flung diamond showers upon the glistening dark sand . " How can she be afraid with you beside her ? " Elizabeth 's voice was muted by the waves , but he heard her . " She is afraid of me  --  of being a wife . " So that is it , Elizabeth thought . She had begun to suspect . " She fears childbirth , " said Jack heavily . He reached down and picked up a cockle shell ; frowning , he fingered the delicate flutings . " Fears it more than is natural . She may love me but not enough to  --  " He flung the shell far from him . " Nor should I talk to you like this . " He raised his head and looked at her inp170her new crimson gown . The strong breasts and shoulders , the proud lovely face silhouetted against the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly . " Gentle her , persuadeher , then maybe force her in the end , a little . " " Aye  --  " he answered after a moment when her meaning reached him . Then he stiffened . he raised his eyes , staring at her now with what seemed like anger . " But by God , I do n't want to ! " " Jack  --  " she whispered . She caught her breath , and the words tumbled over each other . " Jack , we both love her , you do , you know you do , you must have patience , she is so tender , so unaware . .. " He said nothing . He took a sharp step forward and seized her in his arms . She made a whimpering sound , but she yielded her mouth to his . They stood there interlocked and trembling , while the waves pounded behind them . A fishing boat grated on the shingle nearby . There were voices and the light of a lantern . Jack 's arms dropped , he jerked his mouth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said through his teeth , " incestuous . May God forgive me . " Dim as the light had grown she saw real anger now in the brown eyes that were usually merrily observant . An anger that engulfed the world . " Come , Bess  --  " he said sharply . " My mother will be wondering where we are . " They walked up the beach far separated from each other . They went silently through the twisted streets of Sandwich until they came to Humphrey 's house and were greeted at the door by Marthawith a glad cry of welcome . The next afternoon the entire Winthrop company having driven the six miles to the quay at Deal , embarked in the Lyon 's longboat . Though Margaret said nothing as she settled herself in the stern , a tear glistened on her check , and she clutched her whimperingbaby tight in her arms . Her four-year-old Sammy nestled beside her and stared with open mouth at the half-naked sailors , but she had had to leave Deane in London with the Downings . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he thought it best neither to risk the journey for Deane , nor interrupt his schooling . It was a sorry blow . Yet soon I shall see my oldest boys and my beloved husband , if God wills it , Margaretthought , seeking acceptance as always . And the rest of her family were here with her , comfort enough for leaving Deane  --  and England . The sailors began to row and Margaret though herself frightened of the water managed to smile at Martha who sat rigid on the next thwart beside Jack . The boat started to pitch as they moved from shelter . " See our ship ! " cried Margaret en/couragingly . " Does she not look large and staunch ? " She indicated the 250-ton Lyon which rode far out at anchor in the middle of the downs , her flags flying , her high poop newly painted in red and blue , the rampant lion on the prow sparkling with new gilt . Martha did not turn to look , nor answer . She fixed her eyes on the dirty water that sloshed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep from whimpering as did the infant Ann . Jack despisedher fears , she knew , and she despised herself . Already the motion of the boat and the vast insecurity of the treacherous sea made her sick and giddy . She sat frozen , while her muscles tensed as though they could rush her back to land . Mary Winthrop crouched on a chest of their household goods , beyond the four rowing sailors . Her plain freckled face was composed . Under her serviceable brown wool cape she held her vellumboundpsalm book ; in her personal chest she had some other books she had bought in London . These and needlework were all Mary needed to while away the voyage . She longed to see her father of whom she was quietly fond . For the rest she was a philosopher , and though only eighteen was untroubled by youthful turbulence . She appeared indeed older than Elizabeth , who had wedged herself into the bow with Joan and was eagerly savoring the motion of the boat , the slapping of waves on the hull , and the flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sleepless worry over those moments on the beach with Jack . Guilt-ridden because she could not help reliving them and longing for their repetiton . Towards dawn her thoughts had grown so unmanageable that she had even dug her Bible out of the bottom of her bride chest and fumbled through Leviticus until she found the Lord 's terrible ordinances in the twentieth chapter : The adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death . . . If a man shall take his brother 's wife , it is an unclean thing : he bath uncovered his brother 's nakedness .. . And if a woman should lust for her sister 's husband . . . as well ? She had tried to pray for the first time in years . She arose very weary but calmer . She and Jack greeted each other coolly , and both plunged into the bustle of departure . I can manage to avoid him on the ship , Elizabeth thought , and once over there I shall be free . She had no idea how , but she vaguely envisioned herself and Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower garden , far from interference , or temptation . The bo'sun piped them on board and Captain Peirce greeted them on the Lyon 's deck as they climbed the wooden ladder.  | " Welcome ! Welcome ! " he cried bowing . " ' T is honor to carry the Gov'nor 's family ! I 've ' ad cabins built for ye next my quartersin the poop . I ' ope they 'll serve . " A wise tough cockney was the famous master mariner , who had been born in a tenement on London Bridge and raised on the docks . He had had schooling before he took to sea , read for pleasurewhen he could and had shrewd knowledge of life besides . He was a broad powerful man , just forty , and sun-squint lines had begun to show , the tiny red veins to burst , in his black-bearded cheeks . He maintained a fierce discipline on his ship , but was not lacking in humor , and after greeting the Winthrops a rueful twinkle appeared in his sharp eyes . " We 've a passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't expect , and find a bit awkward , though I could n't refuse ' er . " " Her ? " said Margaret , casting anxious glances at the decks which seemed very small and crowded under some fifty milling passengers , bundles , chests and shouting sailors . " ' T is Lady Gardiner , " said Peirce . " Leastways one of ' em . The French one . " Seeing that Margaret did not understand , he turned to jack . " ' Ave ye not-heard , sir , about the rogue in Massachusetts called Sir Christopher Gardiner ? A mort o ' trouble ' e 's made for your honored father ! " " Aye , " said Jack , frowning , " I have . Gardiner 's conspired against our colony , he plots with Sir Ferdinando Gorges to seize us and destroy our independence . He lives with a wench not his wife and yet has two wives in England . " " Just so , " said the Captain . " And this is one of ' em . Coming ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage money , and letters from ' igh places , so I could n't say ' er nay , but I misdoubt she 'll fit well wi ' your God-fearing company , sir . " He chuckled , then looked apologetic . " I thought my father had put Gardiner in gaol to await deportationto England , " said Jack , still frowning . He too had spent a sleepless night . The Captain shrugged . " ' E was in gaol . No telling where ' e be now . Elizabeth heard , but was not much interested , being in a fever to explore the ship and see where they would lodge for the voyage . This turned out to be a tiny cabin in the poop , with an upper and lower bunk no larger than coffins , and scarce room enough to stand beside them . This cabin she was to share with Mary , and , of course , Joan . The next cabin contained Margaret , Sammy and the baby ; the third Jack and Martha . Though these cabins were remarkably cramped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hammocks or pallets in the hold . Each Winthrop cabin had a minute square porthole and a bucket dangling on a rope beneath it for the disposalof excreta . The common folk had no privacy at ' all . " Hush thee , poppet  --  hush thee  --  " Elizabeth crooned to Joan as she snuggled the protesting baby down on the straw sackingof their bunk . " This 'll be our home for many a long day , we 'd best like it ! " Elizabeth raised her head sharply listening to strange sounds that were to become as familiar as the noise of London traffic or of cawing rooks at Groton . She heard the Captain shout , " heave away-y-yy ! " and the clankingof chain , then the squeak of the windlass as the great anchor rose from the water . She heard the straining chant of the sailors and the bo'sun 's whistle . She heard the unintelligible orders to " Man the royals " and " the topgallants , " the answering hubbub of " Aye , aye , sirs ! " followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She rushed out eagerly to the quarter-deck , and felt the gentle rocking give way to a thrill and thrust beneath her feet , as though the ship had wakened . The ten square sails and one lateen bellied out taut against a blue-and-mare's-tail sky . The Lyon quivered and plunged southward to the Straits of Dover , on a brisk north wind . Captain Peirce stood by his helmsman watching narrowly till they should be past Goodwin Sands , but he threw Elizabeth a word of reproof . " Ye 're not wanted on the steerage , Mistress , ye can take leave o ' England from the stern gallery if ye wish  --  but ' twill be tears wasted , for yell ' ave sight o ' English coast a long time yet . " " I 'm sorry , " she said . " ' T was not to say farewell I trespassed here  --  it was because  --  Oh , the ship is so beautiful , so splendid ! " The Captain snorted . " I ' ope ye think so a month from now when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your bunk as yell surely be ! " " No , I wo n't , " she retorted , and went back through the tiny companionway . Peirce laughed . " A fair saucy wench , " he said to the helmsman . " She and that Frenchy Lady Gardiner 'll spice this v'yage  --  ' ard over to larboard , ye damn fool ! " he added in a bellow . The north wind held , the Dover Straits were as rough as usual , and the Captain 's expectation as to his unseasoned passengers was justified by suppertime , for which nobody appeared in the officer'ssaloon but Elizabeth , an unknown man and a startling young woman . The Captain made hurried introductions though he did notp174stay with them to eat . " Mistress ' enry Winthrop , widow . This is the Reverend John Eliot , boarded at Gravesend . ' Is Worship the Gov'nor 'll be pleased to get another minister . " Elizabeth inclined her head , and the short curly-haired young man bowed with a peculiarlysweet smile . He does n't look like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lady Gardiner , Mistress Winthrop , " went on the Captain , with a wink at Elizabeth , who curtseyed and stared , seeing in that first instant only an improbable mass of violet-red hair , brocaded green taffeta , scarlet lips in a pointed face and nearly naked bosom with a black beauty patch on the curve of the right breast . " Enchantee , " said Lady Gardiner in a husky drawl . She extendedher hand , which released a wave of musk . " Charming that you are not seeck like the others , Madame . Oh my dear love of a capitaine , you must not leave us ? Mr. Eliot will find it hard to entertain two young ladies alone . You must stay , Monsieur , you promised Mirabelle she would have a gay voyage ! " " And so no doubt ye will , my lady ! " said the Captain chuckling . " But ' twill be gayer if the Lyon stays on course and above the waves , so I ask ye to excuse me . " He bowed and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Lady Gardiner in loud cooing tones . " So virile , how you say ? Manly . And you too , sir . " She turned to Mr. Eliot . " When I see you embark at that terrible Gravesend  --  what macabre names you English give places !  --  I say to myself , ' Mirabelle , we shall be dear friends , thees young minister and I '  --  You have so sympathetic a face ! " " You do me too much honor , my lady , " said John Eliot , retreatingslightly along the seat , and flushing . " We 'll all be friends before journcy 's end , I 'm sure , and you ladies 'll help me endure the heartache I feel at leaving my betrothed to wait in England . " " Aha ? " cried Mirabellc with warm interest . " So you have a fiancee ? You must tell us about her , must n't he , Madame ? Do you like to kiss her very much ? " She 's incredible , thought Elizabeth , fascinated , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or did rather , and hope to again beforevery long . " It was impossible to be angry with Mirabelle , though by the time the Lyon had reached the Isle of Wight , Elizabethknew that she should disapprove of her . Mirabelle dyed her hair with henna powder she had brought from Paris . Mirabelle painted her face , she swung her hips when she walked . She blandishedevery man she saw , not excepting the sailors , and she laughed at all the virtues Elizabeth had been taught to consider sacred . Particularly chastity.  | " That is because I am an aristocrat , " Mirabelle explained to Elizabeth one calm bright day while she sat on a stool in the open stern gallery carefully plucking her eyebrows . " My father was a marquis , and considered chastity vulgar . True , I was born on the wrong side of the blanket , as you say , but no matter . I inherit the trait . Love-making is agreeable . Why not enjoy it ? " Elizabeth gulped and laughed . Mirabelle constantly said things Elizabeth had chided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rebellion , though she later repented . But Mirabelleseemed unaware of sin or guilt , and it was extraordinary that she seemed to have escaped all righteous punishment . She was gay and charming and titled ; half the men on the ship were in love with her , while even the minister John Eliot did not censure her . It was puzzling . " You are too serious , ma petite , " said Mirabelle squinting into her hand glass and rouging her wide voluptuous mouth . " Much too pretty to be so serious . You must please yourself while you can . " " I 'd like to , " said Elizabeth slowly . " I did once  --  " she thought of the Mulberry Garden and that ecstatic Palm Sunday , " but it was wrong  --  and I was punished for it . " " Bah ! " said Mirabelle , smiling at the girl . " You think that because you are a Puritan . Always examining conscience . " " But I 'm not ! I 'm not truly religious at all . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , cherie . " Mirabelle 's small greenish eyes fixed themselves kindly on Elizabeth . She nodded and shrugged . " You can not help acting from what you were taught in childhood , even though you do n't want to . Above all this is true for a woman . " " Have you no religion , my lady ? " said Elizabeth , disliking the other 's calm certainty , and finding that an image of a frowning John Winthrop had risen in her mind . The Frenchwoman laughed . " I was baptized a catholique . I shall die one , sans doute . In between I do n't concern myself . Time enough to worry about my soul when my body no longer gives pleasure . " They were silent , Elizabeth gazing back across the water towards the dim line of the Devon coast , while Mirabelle affixed a tinyblack star beneath her collarbone to emphasize the whiteness ofher skin and draw the eye lower towards the charm of her decolletage . Elizabeth watched and said timidly , " Forgive me , butwhy do you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But I desert heem ! " cried Mirabelle , showing all her beautifulp176teeth in a hearty laugh . " I disappeared one day to Anjou with a so handsome colonel , you ca n't imagine ! My poor Christophe consoled himself by going to London and marrying a very rich English lady . I did not blame him . But soon I tire of my colonel , and it appears Christophe tires of his new wife  --  she is quite ugly , poor thing , and thin , it must be like sleeping with a rake  --  so he goes off to your colonies , and I go to London to find him . " " You found his English wife ? But were n't you angry ? " " Ah ca , non , " said Mirabelle laughing harder . " She was . But I am the first  --  ' la legitime . ' I still feel tendresse for Christophe , and say I 'll go to fetch him back  --  if I want him . Or maybe I 'll send him back to her , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now . Ilow do I know until I see ? En fin , I like to voyage , and certain complaisant gentlemen in London made me presents , so I can do as I please . " " I see , " said Elizabeth , wondering what such a life could possiblyfeel like , envying it , even while aware of more shock than she wished to admit . She gazed hard at Lady Gardiner , thinking that without the paint and powder and hair dye her looks would not be remarkable at all , and yet she gave the impression of assured beauty . " Cherie , " said Mirabelle gently , shaking out her taffeta skirts and standing up . " I 've noticed something . I 'm older than you  --  how many years I do n't tell  --  and I like you very much  --  so you must not mind what I say . You are not happy , your brother-inlaw , Monsieur Jack Winthrop , is unhappy , and your little sister  --  she is sick in her cabin all the time , so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth sharply , turning away and clenching her hands on the railing . " There 's naught to be done about it . " " Quelle folie ! " Mirabelle sighed . " When it is so simple . You two desire each other , and pretend you do n't , so you suffer . Je suis pratique , moi . Satisfy this desire  --  oh very discreetly  --  and soon you wo n't have it . The little sister will be none the wiser , and you will all be happier ! " Elizabeth drew a rough breath , and her eyes blazed . " That 's wicked ! It 's disgusting ! How dare you say such a thing ! " " Voila , " said Mirabelle sadly shaking her head . " The little Puritan indeed . Why can I not say what you have often thought ? I give you good advice . I am very experienced . " Elizabeth 's hands relaxed , and her anger died , quenched by her inherent honesty . She stared at the white board planking with its lines of oozing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you guess ? It frightens me that anyone should have guessed  --  surely nobody else ... "  | " No . No one else . " Mirabelle put her scented hand on the other girl 's shoulder . " But I can tell by the way you and Monsieur Winthrop avoid each other , by the way you look at him when lie does not know . I can tell because he is the only max on the ship who has no awareness of me . Tiens , cherie , do not be a stupid Iittle provincial . All could arrange itself . My cabin behind the roundhouse is most fortunately placed for privacy , this I have proven . You may use it any time . " Elizabeth felt her cheeks turn hot . She glanced at Mirabelle and saw in the seductive face only genuine sympathy and some amusement . She understood that to Mirabelle this was all a game , that to her the bars of guilt and rigid prohibition actually did not exist . " I could not , " said Elizabeth quietly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so please never speak like this again . It pains me . " " Pauvre chou , " said Mirabelle , tucking her cosmetic box beneath her arm . " As you wish . But then you must find another man soon . A husband you can manage . A husband who adores you blindly . Yes , a man like that would make you happy . " She kissed Elizabethon the cheek and went in through the companionway to her cabin , where she was not surprised to find the second mate  --  a lusty young Scot  --  awaiting her impatiently . The voyage continued . Two days later they passed Land 's End on a stiff breeze and the passengers crowded the decks to watch granite cliffs and the lighthouse slide past and fade into the sky behind them . All the passengers were very quiet  --  the ordinary folk crowded in the waist of the ship , and the privileged ones on the poop . Of the former only Goody Knapp from Suffolk wailed convulsively , and one elderly tanner who was going to join his son in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God Save the King , and God bless Our Old England ! " The Winthrops stood close together . Margaret 's eyes were wet , and there was a lump in Elizabeth 's throat , but these Cornish cliffs were not their England and two weeks on shipboard had dulled homesickness . " I shall be back again someday , " said Jack confidently . " I 'll not say adieu . " He knew that his father would need an emissary to the Old World , and that there would be business for the Colony to transact there . He had no feeling of exile , nor fear of the journey , having spent so long at sea on his trip to the Levant and being at heart a voyager . " I shall never go home again , " said Martha in a small wooden voice . " Never . " She turned quickly from sight of the water , and leaned her head against Elizabeth 's shoulder.  | " Nonsense , " said Elizabeth , putting her arm around her sister . " If Jack returns , doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be home . ' " Martha said nothing . She had nearly recovered from seasicknessbut had grown very thin ; her blue wool dress hung limp as rags , and her little bones jutted through the pallid skin . She looked at Jack , a dark veiled look , but he did not see it . He was talking with John Eliot by the rail . The two young men found each other congenial and were full of eager speculation on what they would find . Eliot was particularly interested in the Indians and made plans for their conversion . He had read everything he could about them , and even memorized the names of some of the tribes . At Jesus College in Cambridge he had become a linguist and exceptional scholar . In the ship 's saloon he and Jack passed many an hour together discussing their specialties . Eliot expoundedthe Bible and the liberal Puritan views of Mr. Thomas Hooker with whom he had studied in Essex , while Jack drew sketches of fortifications , of windmills and saltworks . Jack 's mind teemed with ideas for establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was occupied with these things he forgot his troubled marriage , and the dark disturbances produced by Elizabeth . Captain Peirce came out to them on the poop , swept them all with a rather sardonic eye and said , " Well , we 're fairly off at last into the open sea . Glad to see ye 're not sobbing . " Nor praying either , he thought . This shipload was the least canting and psalm-singing of all he 'd carried to Massachusetts . Even Eliot , the minister , minded his own business , and only preached on Sundays . " Where 's Lady Gardiner ? " Peirce asked , though he suspected the answer . " Why , she went in some time ago , " said Elizabeth . " Said she was tired of staring at the English coast . " " Aha , " said the Captain . MacDuff , the second mate , was missingtoo . Still , the Scot was off duty now , and Peirce was far too canny a Master to concern himself with anything which did not prejudice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babe today , ma'am ? " he asked Margaret , who tried to smile and did not answer . Each day little Ann grew more listless , and could scarcely be roused to drink the goat 's milk a servant brought up from the hold where the beasts were kept . " May I go below , Captain ? " said Elizabeth quickly . " To wherevermy chest of herbs is stored . I 've some dried valerian I think would help the baby , and I can best find it myself . "  |p179The  Captain gave ready consent , though he did not permit female passengers to run about the ship at will , getting in the sailors ' way and hurting themselves in heavy weather . " Since ye 've knowledge of physick , Mistress , will ye ' ave a look at the Beamsley boy while ye 're down below . They tell me ' e sickens . " And the Lord grant it 's neither measles , plague nor smallpox , thought the Captain grimly . Any of those killers could halve a shipload in a fortnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him down the stairs to the main deck . Several children were crouched by the windlass playing at Hot Cockles , while a large lad of about fifteen sat on the windlass , whittling and good-humoredly umpiring the game . The wind was veering , and the sea roughened . The Lyon gave a lurch as Elizabeth passed the group . She caught at the lad 's shoulder , and landed almost in his lap . " Forgive me ! " she cried laughing . " I thought I 'd better sea legs . " The youth laughed too , setting her on her feet . " Do it again ! " he said . " ' T is a fine game with so fair a player . " Elizabeth looked at him with attention , startled by this gallantry . The voice , deep and nearly a man 's , had the lilt of the southern counties . He was dressed in the common leather jerkin and red Monmouth cap of the artisan class , but his inflection and words sounded almost like gentry . His rosy , beardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lank taffy-colored hair indicatedhis age , but if he had not yet his growth  --  he was going to be a huge man , for already he topped Elizabeth by four inches and his shoulders were thick and broad as Captain Peirce 's . Elizabeth 's sailor guide was waiting , yet she lingered , curious and attracted by the youth who was looking at her with open admiration . " What are you whittling ? " she asked at random . She examined his piece of wood , and cried , " Oh , how skillful ! " He was fashioning two intricately carved balls out of a maple burl . " Well , " he said , showing how one ball moved within the other . " I must keep my hand in , I was ' prenticed to a joiner in Dorset . " " But surely you 've not finished your ' prenticeship ! " He shook his head and grinned at her . " No , Mistress . Just begun . But I 'd no stomach for daily beatings , and naught to eat ever but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . rigorous . " And how did you get passage money ? " " I did n't steal it , I assure you , " he answered the startled speculationhe had seen in her eyes . Years later she was to rememberp180this moment on the Lyon 's main deck , and the sudden attraction that rose from nowhere between them . Even at the time she wondered at herself for her compelling interest as she said , " What is your name , and where are you bound ? " " William Hallet , " he said , sketching a bow , " and I 'm bound for where pleases me most . I 'm my own master now . " He spoke with perfect courtesy , yet she was conscious of reserve and dignity beyond his age . She recollected herself , said hastily , " Good Luck to you , then , " smiled and joined her guide who was picking his teeth and staring gloomily towards the western sky where black clouds were massing . She descended through the hatch by a steep ladder to the ' tween decks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hammocks slung . It was preferred space since it had portholes but these were battened down at present ; the stench was strong , and the light poor . The Beamsley boy was twelve years old and lay doubled up and moaning in a hammock , while his mother who was great with child watched him anxiously . " He 've bin so , sence daybreak , Missus , " she said to Elizabeth in broadest Lincolnshire . " Writhing ' n ' a-clutching his belly till I 'm fair beset . " Elizabeth bent over the boy , who seemed slightly feverish , but had no pocks or spots . She poked gently at his rigid abdomen , and he cried out when she touched the right side near the hipbone , but Elizabeth did not think him very ill . " Just some cramp and wind in the bowel , " she said reassuringly to the mother . " Has he been purged ? " " Aye-that , Missus . Mr. Atkins , the barber , drenched him good , not two hours a-gone . " " Hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's not room at the fire to heat water , Missus , " said the goodwife distractedly . " Cook wo n't let me near . " " I 'll see about that , " said Elizabeth , and she went down another ladder to the dark , smoky hold where a small hearth had been built of fire bricks . Over it the ship 's cook in a greasy apron was stirring an enormous iron pot . It contained a stew of salt beef and dried peas , for the common folk 's and sailors ' dinner . The Captainand cabin passengers had a separate galley under the poop . The cook turned a surly face on her request . His main function was not the preparing of food , which consisted almost entirely of this stew , but the guarding and doling out of provisions . " We 've no water to spare , " he growled , but seeing from her dress that she came from the privileged class , he added , " Ye can heat beer , if ye must . We 've more o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was rescued by Sally who came lurching amongst the piled kegs , holding a mug of goat 's milk for Ann . " Be ye here , then , ma'am ! " she cried in astonishment . Elizabeth explained her errand , and left the heating of beer for compresses to Sally while she followed the sailor to the compartmentnear the fo'castle where were stored the Winthrops ' private chests and household furnishings . The sailor held a candle while she rummaged . There was less motion down here , but the air was fetid . The goats , pigs and a brood mare were quartered nearby , as she could hear by bleatings and snufflings which rose above the constant creak of wood and slap of water . There was the smell of tar and bilge , and worse ones too , for the common privy bucket stood outside the compartment . Strong as Elizabeth 's stomach was , her nose was sensitive , and she began to get queasy while she searched amongst the kegs of oatmeal , sugar , figs , pepper , saltpeter , suet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring . There were three firkins of butter and dry-goods boxes too , containing hats , shoes , stockings and bolts of wool in sad colors and red . Except for the necessary pewter , iron pots and andirons there had been scant room for furniture , though Margaret had brought a bedstead , some Turkey carpets , and a huge carved court cupboard which had belonged to her father . Of personal furniture , Elizabeth had only four well-stuffed chests and the great silver salt cellar which had been given her by Adam Winthrop . She came at last upon her store of herbs and seeds , and found the packet marked " Valerian . " She sniffed the heliotrope odor gratefully , and filled her pockets with other herbs which might prove useful , feeling as she did so an instant of content . Suddenly , in the Lyon 's stinking , swaying hold she had a moment of acute awareness , seeing that the skill she had acquired in the use of these simples was a pure satisfaction , an island of refreshment amongst the turmoils of love-longing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then a rat darted out from behind a keg and ran across her feet . She jumped , and hurried from the hold , back up to the deck where she looked for the lad , William Hallet , but he was nowhere to be seen . The next afternoon at dinner , the Captain announced sadly that the Beamsley boy had just died . A sorry shock for the parents , since the child had taken a turn for the better soon after they put the hot cloths on him . The pain had stopped . But he had died all the same . " Oh , I 'm so sorry , " breathed Elizabeth , stricken and bewildered .  | " It is the Lord 's Will , " said Eliot kindly to her . " ' We must not question God 's decisions . " " Amen , " said Margaret in a trembling voice . " God is all merciful , no matter what afflictions he sends to try us . " Her baby seemed no better today , despite the concoction of valerian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicately gnawing on a chicken breast  --  the Captain 's galley still had fresh meat . " But me , I am sceptique . I do not call this boy 's death God 's Will . It is mauvaise fortune , or destiny , or perhaps man 's ignorance  --  I do not mean yours , cherie , " she said to Elizabeth . " You did what you could . " Margaret looked unhappy , feeling that she should wrestle with Lady Gardiner 's laxness , but Eliot did it for her . " That is not a Christian view , my lady , " he said gravely . " Beware of the Devil 's insinuations . " " Oh I do , my friend , I do , " said Mirabelle smiling sweetly at him . " And I know I am a foolish woman , in need of guidance . " She gave him a soft submissive glance , and the young minister thawed. jack watched with detached amusement . He believed that the boy 's death was God 's Will , or it would not have happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and . far surpassed her in scientific interest . If we could have seen into the boy 's belly , he thought , I wonder what we would have found . There must have been a bodily cause , even though God instigated it . This speculationled him to Martha , who still looked very ill . She sat as far from the others as she could in the tiny saloon . She had eaten nothing but broth , nor spoken a word during dinner . He knew that she slept badly , for he heard her tossing and sighing in her bunk beneath his . Once he had seen a wild hunted light in her eyes , and when lie spoke to her she had not answered , nor recentlyhad seemed to want the reassurances she had always implored. "  --  And so we 'd best get on wi ' it ! " said Captain Peirce rising and finishing instructions to Eliot . " Ye can pray what ye like , sir , but on my ship we 'll ' ave the burial service as well . " Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the main deck . IIc , like all the nonconformists , had broken with set prayers , as they had with other forms and rituals of the Church of England , but he was a reasonable man . The crew and passengers stood , bareheaded , by the rail as the weighted bundle slipped into the sea . There was a shrill scream from the mother , and then silence . The sailors swarmed up thep183rigging . The Captain ordered an extra ration of beer for everyone . The ship 's life continued . A week later in the driving rain , the scene was repeated . All night they had been tossed and buffeted by an equinoctial storm , and at the height of it the baby , Ann Winthrop , loosed her tenuoushold on life . Margaret took it quietly , though into her soft brown eyes there came an added depth . She listened gratefully to Eliot 's prayers , and she read incessantly in her Geneva Bible . Elizabeth noted with wonder that Margaret 's staunch faith seemed even to strengthen after this tragedy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself to helping Elizabeth with Joan , who remained healthy , in extra cherishing of her own little Sammy , and in trying to hearten Martha . There was no doubt that Martha must have some strange malady . She had ceased to speak at all , except for one sentence when they told her of little Ann 's death . " Good , " she whispered , and went on with confused words from the burial at sea in the prayer book . " We commit her body to the deep . . . until the sea shall give up her dead . . . and the corruptible bodies of those who sleep there . . . shall be . . . shall be at peace . . . in the Lord . " The girl turned her head and wept without sound as she had taken to doing . Margaret and Elizabeth exchanged a frightened glance . They found that Jack shared their mounting worry , though manlike he tried to make light of it , saying that sea voyages often depressed sensitive organisms . They called Atkins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said she had a touch of scurvy . So Jack ordered up from the hold the gallon of infused scurvy grass , saltpeter and lemon water Governor Winthrop had written them to prepare in Groton . Martha drank the medicine when told to , and seemed a little stronger . Sometimes she sat on the poop deck and gazed down at the waves with a listening look as though they spoke to her , but mostly she lay in her bunk and stared at the rough planking above her head . In the middle of October , they entered their eighth week of the voyage . Lately they had been delayed by contrary winds and fog , interspersed with sudden gales which occasioned the usual accidents . The spritsail had torn off in a heavy sea , some of the shrouds on the mizzen had parted . These had been repaired by the sailmaker and ship 's carpenter with help from male passengers . There had been other mishaps which Captain Peirce looked upon as routine . Two of the goats died and the company greedily feasted on them since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rigging of the mainmast and broke his leg on the deck . There had been two vicious fights , one between sailors , and one between two drunken passengers . The sailors had been well flogged by the bo'sun . Jack Winthrop had disciplined the landsmen in an improvised pillory . Somewhere in mid-Atlantic they had sighted a ship with a strange rig and feared she might be an enemy privateer . They had manned the guns . But she turned out to be a harmless Swedish trader bound home with cod from the Grand Banks . One time they narrowly avoided a gigantic waterspout , which whirled and funneled to leeward , another day there was anxiety about a frolicsomeschool of whales near as big as the ship , which surfaced and blew too close for comfort . The master mariner remained imperturbable through all these incidents , but there came an afternoon of dead calm when he summoned Jack to his quarters . " Sit ye down , sir , " he said , puffing on his pipe and extending a mug of rum . " I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jack asked slowly , smiling thanks for the drink . " Not yet , but I 'm uneasy . There 's a queer thick smell to the air , and it 's turned too warm . Look at us ! " The Captain pointed through the porthole to a yellowish sky and glassy sea which undulated in huge lazy swells that scarce rocked the ship . " Wallowingin doldrums we are , and at this latitude ! " He placed a stumpy finger on his chart . " I figure we 're about crossing forty . We 're a couple o ' clays off the Banks on a stiff breeze , and we should be getting it , or cold fog . This feels like the Indies . " It felt like the coming of what the Caribs called a " hirracano " such as Peirce had once battled through on a voyage to Barbadoes , but that was ridiculous so far north . " The bo'sun saw St. Elmo 's fire balls skipping up ' n ' down the foremast yester e'en , " said Peirce heavily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but the crew 's fidgety . " Jack nodded gravely . Not a seaman lived but considered the spectral lights of the " corposant " boded disaster . " What can I do , Captain ? " " Look to the passengers , quiet them if trouble comes . I 'll ' ave me ' ands full wi ' the ship . And muzzle that Goodwife Knapp in the ' tween decks . She 's taken to ranting and prophesying . First she saw a merman , then she saw a sea sarpent . Now she 's crying that there 's witchcraft aboard , and the Devil 's lurking in the sail locker . Oh , there 's one or two like ' er on every v'yage , and about this time the landsmen allus get excitable , but I want as little of itp185as possible . Get Mr. Eliot to ' old a psalm-sing , that 'll calm ' em when we begin to strip the decks and batten down the ' atches . " He paused and sniffed the heavy air like an old hound . " Aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to obey orders , and tried to do so without alarminganybody . But there was tension and foreboding throughout the ship . In the poop they all reacted to the unrest . Margaret redoubled her private prayers and helped Elizabeth soothe Joan who had grown fretful . Mary indulged herself in the gripping romance of Sir Philip Sydney 's Arcadia , and managed to forget her surroundings . Mirabelle decided to profit by the calm and a bucket of rain water gathered in the last gale . She proceeded to wash and dye her hair . To the women 's astonishment , Martha got out of her bunk , dressed herself in a gray silk gown hitherto unworn , put on her best lace collar and cuffs and went to the stern gallery where she walked back and forth in an agitated manner , quite unlike her previous torpor . In an hour a southerly wind began to blow , and the wide oily sea ruffled . There was general relief as the ship moved again  --  under moderate sail . The familiar creakings and strainings and swishings were welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wind increased and the Captain furled the topsails , rejoicing that the Lyon had always been maneuverable , answering quickly to the helm as he tacked , hoping that they might withstand being blown straight back towards England . But l ) y seven there was a full gale , worsening every minute , and shortly thereafter Peirce knew that all his fears were realized . The wind passed the tempest point into a howling fury with mountainous crashing waves as bad as the " hirracano " near Barbadoes . He had got her turned into the wind , and reefed all but a section of the mainsail before the worst of it . Then he lashed himself to the mizzen , near the grim sweating helmsmen on the tiller . They could see the black waves towering and crashing over the fo'castle as the Lyon continually plunged , shook herself , hesitated and sluggishly recovered . They heard above the din a sickening boom like a cannon shot , and peered through sheets of rain , until there was a lull . " Half the mainmast 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the tattered mainsail flying off white against the blackness . " If only the rudder 'll ' old ! " cried Peirce . " By God  --  if only the rudder 'll ' old . Ye might pray , men . " In the poop they were already praying , each in his own way . Eliot was not with them since he had been battened down in thep186hold with the common passengers , and there they had long ceased to sing psalms while they desperately calked leaks and worked the pumps . The Winthrops , white-faced , were huddled in the saloon , clinging to each other and the fixed center table . Jack helped steady the women and soothe Joan and Sammy who were both wailing as they were all thrown from end to end of the pitching cabin . Mary moaned from time to time and retched into a bucket . " Lord be merciful , be merciful , " Margaret kept murmuring . " Yet if it is Thy will that we drown , take our souls straight to heaven and Thy loving arms . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mirabelle plaintively . She had wedged herself on the floor between the table and bench , her damp red hair flowed around her . " It seems I do not wish to die without the last rites . I am not so sceptique as I imagined ! " Nor am I , thought Elizabeth , clutching Joan harder as a thunderous wave crashed over the main deck and deluged them with spray through the portholes . She found that she too was praying ; frantically pleading with the Almighty to save them and making Him promises . " I will be good always . I 'll have no more sinful worldly lusts . I will obey and worship Thee as I should . Oh , save Joan at least  --  Dear God ! " After a while there came a sudden stop to the roar outside , the ship steadied a trifle . They looked at each other with fearing wonder . " Can it be over ? " whispered Margaret . " I do n't know , " said Jack . " We can pray so . " He flexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here , " he said dipping out a mugful . " We need it . " They all drank , even Martha who seemed in this moment of general terror to have forgotten her own . Her little face was exalted . She looked as though she had some happy secret . " That Goody Knapp ! " said Jack at random , speaking to distract them . " From Silly Suffolk , like us ! She sees monsters and goblins and enchanted islands , she prophesied this tempest because she says we 've a Jonah aboard . " Martha drew a sharp little breath , and fixed her hollow eyes on her husband . " How interesting , " said Mirabelle , easing herself and shaking out her hair . " Who could the Jonah be ? Not me , I hope . Some of those good women below do not like me because their husbands do . " " No , not you , " said jack , smiling faintly . " She 's fixed on some wretched sailor her goodman ran foul of . "  | " Jonah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked , did n't he ? " asked Martha in a quick breathless voice . Jack assented , relieved that she spoke and looked brighter . Elizabeth was not relieved . She heard a note in Martha 's voice that escaped the others , but had no time to think of it , for the lull abruptly ceased . The wind swooped down with a roar more violent than before , and fear returned . The poundings and crashings and terrifying lurches resumed . Though protected by horn frames , the candles guttered wildly and went out . In darkness and silence now their bodies were rolled or pitched about in the saloon . Sea and rain water deluged them through a dozen leaks . Time blurred and stopped . In Elizabeth'smind ran strange fancies . She thought of her packets of seeds lying patiently in the hold wishful of turning into bright flowers in the new land . She saw them blooming as they would have been , the hollyhocks , the marigolds , the violets and wallflowers . How sad for them that they must lie forever barren at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and saw his golden laughing face , his reckless swagger . She saw his finger lift as though he beckoned , and she cried to him , " Nay , Harry , nay . We are not ready yet , your child and I ! " Harry dissolved and in her head she heard music . The singing of many voices very pure and low , not as the Puritans twanged through their noses , but as she had once heard St. Paul 's choir in London long ago . Yet it was a psalm the voices sang . " If I take the wings of the morning , and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea ; even there shall thy hand lead me , and thy right hand shall hold me . . . " The voices sang like chiming bells that ended in a jangle , when her outer ears caught a new sound . She started , and stiffened as her mind cleared . It was the sound of shouting outside the door Jack had bolted against the waves . " Ahoy ! Ahoy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the door , and the Captain staggered in holding a lantern . His face was glistening and haggard , but he smiled at them . " Thanks be to God , it 's passed over , " he shouted . " I believe we 've weathered it . Can ye leave the women ? " he asked jack . " I need every man on deck . ' Alf the mainmast 's gone , the longboat'sstove in , and part o ' the fo'castle , and the main ' atch is jammed , but we 're still afloat ! " " We 're all right , " cried Elizabeth , and rushed to light their candles at the Captain 's lantern . Margaret began to cry softly . Martha was curled in a corner of the benches with her head in her arms and did not look up as Jack went off with the Captain.  |p188The  sea dropped rapidly , and the stars came out brilliant in a chilly sky . Presently Jack came back and said they had unjammed the hatch and released those below decks , all of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no more to be done till daylight . They had better go to bed . The women obeyed . Elizabeth tumbled into her bunk with Joan , and after one great sob of thanksgiving fell instantly asleep . She was shaken awake an hour later in the dawn light to see Jack standing by the bunk and more fear in his face than there had been through the tempest . " Bess  --  " he said , " Bess  --  Martha 's gone . I ca n't find her . She went while I slept , but her going roused me . I 've searched the poop . " Elizabeth gasped and jumped to her feet . They rushed together through the companionway and down to the quarter-deck , where the helmsman stared . They looked down on the main deck and saw figures , two carpenters hammering on the longboat , and near them , also working , Elizabeth recognized the lad William Hallet . She clutched Jack 's arm and cried , " Look ! " They saw a little figure , in gray , slip along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant by Hallet who was next the starboard rail , and seemed to speak to him . Then , as Jack shouted " Martha ! " the girl turned and waved , throwing her arms above her head , and darting through the partly shattered rail , plunged into the sea . Jack flew down the stairs with Elizabeth after him . He dashed across the deck , but young Mallet was quicker . He dove in almost as Martha hit the water and grabbed her floating hair as she came up . " Throw me a rope  --  " he yelled . The carpenters came running with the boat hook and its attached line . Jack seized it and heaved it out . The lad caught it , they pulled him in , and Jack , held by the men , clambered clown the side until he could grab his wife from the boy 's clutch and haul her up and onto the deck , where she lay in a swoon , breathing heavily . Hallet climbed up and vaulted onto the deck . He stood panting and looking down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she  --  she did it , " he whispered . " Said she was a Jonah . Everyone 'd be happy when she 'd gone . Poor little thing . " Jack took the lad 's hand and shook it . " Thanks be to God you were there and can swim , " he cried . " Get some dry things on . " He picked Martha up and carried her across the deck to the poop stairs . Elizabeth , who was trembling so she could hardly stand , cried , " Jack , shall I change her clothes and heat her some sack ? "  | " No , " he answered grimly . " I will deal with her myself . Do n't interfere with me , Bess , and do n't leave your cabin , no matter what you hear ! " He mounted the stairs and stalked back to the saloon with his burden . He forced brandy through Martha 's lips until she sighed and opened her eyes . She gazed up at his grim face with a remote wonder . " My love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought never to see you again . " " Why did you do it , Martha ? Why did you do it ? " " Because you do n't love me , and because I am guilty  --  guilty  --  " " Hush ! " he said . " I do love you , and we are all guilty . We have each one been saved from death this terrible night . I do n't know what for , unless it is to learn the meaning of life . " He downed a mugful of brandy , gave her some . He carried her to their cabin , where he ripped off her wet clothes , dried her with the blanket , and lay down with her in her bunk . He pulled her roughly into his arms.  |p193ON  THE LYON , the next morning after the tempest , the sun shone , and a light northerly breeze gave the ship steerage way , but permittedmost of the crew to join in the repairs . Mr. Eliot held a solemn Thanksgiving on deck , then went to bed exhausted . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when Elizabethwent to her sister 's cabin at twilight , the girl was awake , and greeted Elizabeth with a smile . " Bess , " she said softly , " I 've been living in black shadows a long time , have n't I ? I do n't remember much . " " Do n't try . " Elizabeth kissed the thin cheek , rejoicing that all strain and wildness had left Martha 's face . " I know what I tried to do , " said the girl quickly taking Elizabeth'shand , " but now I do n't know why , or remember all that happened last night , except the tempest and I had much brandy  --  and Jack  --  Jack  --  " She colored and stopped . " He does love me . " Yes , " said Elizabeth steadily . " I think you are at last truly his wife . I 'm very glad . Now why do n't you get up and make yourself pretty ? We 're to sup soon and the Captain 's ordered a boiled suet pudding stuffed with raisins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha as a child , for still she so appeared and had always acted . But Martha gave her a long grave look that was not childish , and said , " You 're good to me , Bess . You 've all had patience with me . I hope there is not talk about  --  about what happened on the deck . I would n't have you shamed . " " There 'll be no talk , " said Elizabeth . " Jack 's spoken to the carpenters , the helmsman and the young lad who  --  " She paused , wondering if Martha remembered the boy who had saved her , and knew instinctively that she did not . " A lad who was also there , "  |p194she  continued . " Jack told them you were distracted by the tempest . It was a night of extraordinary happenings which everyonewants to forget . " " Aye , " said Martha quickly . She swung her thin legs over the bunk . " Do you suppose Lady Gardiner would help me dress my hair like hers ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure she 'd be delighted . And lend you rouge and beauty patches too if you 'd be so brazen . " The supper was festive . The breeze continuing light , and all repairsgoing forward rapidly , Captain Peirce honored them with his presence . Martha was transformed , not only by Mirabelle 's handiworkbut by a soft glow as she sat beside Jack , who kept looking at her with open tenderness . Only Elizabeth knew and Margaret guessed that this was the true beginning of their honeymoon , yet all were conscious of manifold dangers passed and the richness of their escape . They drank some of the Captain 's excellent sack . Elizabeth longed for her lute , but Jack had a jew's-harp to set the pitch , and they sang together  --  ballads , love songs and country songs in which the young minister joined heartily . Elizabeth was deeply grateful for her sister 's recovery , and the assuaged look in Jack 's eyes , and she went to bed happy . Yet in the middle of the night she awoke to find that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her dreams . " I am a simpleton , " she said aloud , but softly so as not to wake Mary who was snoring in the upper bunk . She put her arms around Joan and drew the baby 's head onto her breast . Joan snuggled down , and presently they both slept . Five days later the Lyon arrived at the Grand Banks which were swathed in the usual fog , and the Captain hove to so that the sailors might fish for the cod of which they stood in great need . Provisions were growing scanty , and even the Captain 's mess was reduced to half rations of salt beef and pease for every meal . There were several cases of scurvy in the hold , and much coughing and sniffles , for the weather had turned bitter , and there was no way to get warm but lie in sour , verminous bedding , or to fight for place near the cooking hearth . Peirce relaxed rules during the fishing , and Elizabeth profited by this to wander over the ship . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wishful of finding William Hallet . The catch was good , and she picked her way amongst fishing lines and a mass of flopping silvery bodies . Finally she spied Hallet near the fo'castle . He was fishing too . He had hooked ap195large cod , his young face was intent , his big body leaned far out as he dextrously played his fish , and jerked it over the rail to land with a watery smack at her feet . He cried , " Careful , wench ! You 'll get hooked yourself if you stand so near ! " Then he saw who it was , and said , " Pardon , Mistress Winthrop . " " Good day , " she said , smiling . " What a big fish . . . I wanted ... I 've been wanting to . . . to thank you . . . for the . . . what you did . . . that night . . . " She knew that she was stammering , and that her constraint came from more than embarrassment at referringto Martha 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a common lad , and yet somehow he made her feel like a green girl . " I do n't want thanks , Mistress , " he said coolly , while he cut off his fish 's head with his knife . " Mr. Winthrop 's loaded me with thanks , and five pounds too , which I would n't have . " " Why not ? " she cried . " You deserve it . And surely five pounds would help you get settled in New England . " " I would n't take money for a thing like that . " He spoke with anger . " You 're like all the gentry , think you can buy a man body and soul for silver . I 'll make my own way and work for what I earn . " She was discomfited . The gay intimacy which had sprung betweenthem the first time was gone . " Will , " she said after a moment of watching him bait his hook , " why do you speak so sharp ? Is n't it natural that I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked at her slowly as she stood beside him in her thick crimson wool cloak , her dark curls wet with fog beneath the hood , her nose red from cold , her long hazel eyes troubled . " The sharpness was n't for you , " he said casting his line out . His tawny hair , salt-crusted , and uncombed , swung forward to hide his face as he peered down into the water . " For what then ? " she persisted . " Wo n't you tell me ? You 're overyoung to be so grim . " " By God , Mistress  --  " he said suddenly turning on her . " Grimnesshas naught to do with years . You speak like the sheltered ninny , no doubt you are ! " " And you  --  " she cried , stiffening , " speak like the boorish rustic , no doubt you are ! " At this he laughed suddenly , a boyish peal , not quite steady . " Touche , " he said , to her amazement . " A neat thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best amends you can make is to tell me how you come top196speak in fencing terms , and use words like amends ' which fit strangely with your clothes and general carriage . Are you perchancesome young lord in disguise ? " " Far from it ! " he snorted . " I 'm a yeoman , at least I come of yeoman stock . We Hallets 've farmed Dorset lands back to Domesday , and the Devil take me if I 'd be anything else ! " He peered over the side at his lint floating limply on the waves , and said with a mixture of gentleness and impatience , " Look , ma'am . There 's no mystery . You 'll have my tale in a trice . I spent six years as page in the household of the Earl of Bristol at Sherborne Castle . I lived with his children , the young Digbys . I was tutored by their tutor , and befriended  --  for a time  --  by Lord George , the heir . " " Ah .... " she said staring at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , and flashes of a manner which had reminded her of the few noblemen she had met . " But was that not an unusual honor for a yeoman ? " " Very . " He folded his arms and leaned against the bulwark . His face darkened . " The way it came about was not so unusual . While the Earl of Bristol was in Spain , chaffering for that Infanta King Charles thought he wanted , my father one black day did ride to Sherborne Fair on his blooded bay stallion . A bay stallion just like it was missing from the castle stables . The Earl 's steward spied my father , convinced himself and Sherborne town that my father had stolen the Earl 's horse . Father was hanged in the marketplace that night . " At her gasp he nodded ironically . " The Earl 's stallion was found some days later , peacefully grazing in a pasture whither it had escaped , and the Earl came home , heard the story and was shocked . Ile dismissed the steward and set out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the farm , and Mother , poor woman , could think of nothing better to ask than that I should be raised a fine gentleman . And so I was , from my eighth to my fourteenth year . " " But then ? What then ? " Elizabeth cried as he peered over at his fishing line and seemed to have finished . " Surely you 're not fourteen now ! " " I 'll be sixteen come Christmastide . " He paused , and went on reluctantly . " Why , then I overheard the Countess talking to her cousin . My lady said she had enough of me , that I made too free with her daughters  --  which was a lie  --  and had forgot my station  --  which might be true . She said that since I should take up a trade and showed a peasant skill with my hands , she 'd ' prentice me to a joiner in Dorchester . I thought in my folly that Lordp197George would speak for me , he and I 'd been good friends , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . So I went to be a joiner , as I told you , and I liked it not . After a year I ran from my master to my brother at our homefarm . " " Then your mother helped you ? " Elizabeth asked eagerly . " My mother was frightened , and ashamed of the way things turned out  --  and my brother told me roundly I 'd become neither fish , flesh , nor good red herring , which when I cooled off I saw the sense of . Our farms were prospering , and he gave me a share of my inheritance , forty pounds , and said I 'd best be off quietly before my master caught me , then make my way as I liked in the world . And so I am . " Elizabeth was silent . She understood now his truculence and touchy pride . She saw that in the end the noble Bristols had done injustice twice over , not only in killing his father , but in dislocatingWilliam 's life to no purpose , and wounding his confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able , he might well find fulfillment in the new country . " Thank you , " she said , " for telling me , Will . I see why it was painful . " His big chilblained dirty hand rested on the bulwark , and without thinking she put her gloved hand over his . " I hope to see you again after we land . " He grew scarlet , staring at her hand , and she thought he would snatch his away . Instead he turned it and carried her hand to his lips . " I think not , Mistress , " he said gruffly . " I 'll not tarry in Boston . " He tucked her hand inside her cloak , a strangely tender little gesture . " I see we 're setting sail . You 'd best return to the poop . " He gathered up his line and went into the fo'castle . She did not see him to speak to again . After they left the Banks , northeast gales began to blow , but the passengers were all so accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interminable voyage . In the tenth week of it , Elizabeth was roused one morning by a pandemonium of shouts and the clear voice of the watch calling above the racket , " Land Ho ! Land Ho ! " She threw on her cloak and rushed to the stern gallery where she saw some leagues to the west a dark wooded mound , which the Captain presently explained was an island named Mount Desert by a French explorer . From then on they were in distant sight of land , and taking soundings every half hour , as the Lyon slipped down the coast past places Peirce called Agamenticus and Piscataqua ; uncouthp198Indian names which interested Elizabeth and John Eliot particularly , though there was nothing to be seen but forest . On Halloween they rounded Cape Ann , and Goody Knapp took to prophesying again in honor of the day . She said she saw goblins with fiery heads bouncing amongst the rocks on shore , and heard the shriek of specters on the night wind . This was reported to the Captain who replied that the goblin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for spectral shrieks , he wished he could hear some himself for they might be a useful warning of reefs . The next day they sailed past Salem , though too far out to see anything , and Elizabeth thought of Harry 's death there . Her heart was heavy , for she found that she could no longer recall his face clearly . On the following evening , Wednesday , November 2 of that year 1631 , the Lyon being unable to enter Boston Harbor against a strong west wind dropped anchor in the Nantasket Roads , and lowered the longboat . At dawn of the next day Jack clambered down the rope ladder into the boat and was rowed the six miles to Boston to give news of their arrival . It was a dazzling blue and gold morning . The air felt crisper and seemed thinner than it did in England . The passengers , all but those too sick with scurvy , were crowded on deck , mostly silent as they stared at the multitude of little islands . Captain Peirce showed the poop passengers a desolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peninsula called Nantasket . He pointed south to the mainland where he said there were villages , Wessagussettor Weymouth , and the deserted remains of Mount Wollastonwhere the lewd , raffish Thomas Morton had shocked PlymouthColony with May Day revels at his home , Merrymount . " So it was there he so naughtily put up his maypole ? " asked Mirabelle with lively interest . " I met him in London , where these Puritans had banished him . He was so enraged about it , poor man . He is a friend of my husband 's , " she added . " I know , m'lady , " said Peirce , chuckling . Mirabelle , dressed in embroidered green velvet , with her flaming hair , decolletage and daring beauty patch , was certain to produce quite an effect on Boston , especially if Sir Christopher were still in gaol . But the young lady could take care of herself ; of that the Captain had grown very sure in these weeks . He looked at the Winthrop women , also dressed in their elegant , brightly colored best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sailed , of course , there were some scurvy sores aroundp199Mistress Mary 's lips , and Mistress Winthrop Senior 's plump cheeks had sagged , but none of them looked too peaked . " Journey 's end , ladies ! " he cried to them . " Barring that tempest , and considering the time o ' year , not so bad a passage  --  eh ? Oh , and your loss , ma'am  --  " he added hastily to Margaret . " Ye know ' ow sorry I am for that . " He had momentarily forgotten the death of two sickly children at sea , so usual were such occurrences , but it was unfortunate that one of them was the Governor 's baby . " I marvel at your skill and excellent care of us , Mr. Peirce , " said Margaret gently . " We all thank you from our hearts . " Her voice trembled . It was hard in these last moments of suspense to keep from tears . They had finally arrived safely , but who knew what might have been happening here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them left Boston on this same Lyon . " How far away England seems , " whispered Martha , pressing close to Elizabeth , who was leaning on the rail , ecstatically sniffing the pine and earth smell . " It seems so strange to see no houses , and I never expected it , yet I dread to leave this dear old ship .. . Oh , what 's that ! " she ended with a little shriek . Elizabeth looked where her sister pointed and saw a birch-bark canoe gliding near them , paddled by two feather-topped figures . " Our first savages , Mattie , " Elizabeth cried , peering down . The canoe grazed the Lyon , and the Indians rested their paddles . The stern paddler was a small young Indian dressed in a blue English doublet and breeches . The doublet was lavishly trimmed with brass buttons sewn on at random . His dark face was tattooed on the cheeks and painted with ocher stripes . His head was shaved except for a long scalp lock which was stiffened with bear 's grease and pierced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue shell wampum beads and one of wolf claws . His companionwas far less splendid , and wore nothing but a skin mantle and breechclout . " I-Tow ! " called the first Indian raising his paddle in salute to the row of faces on the poop deck . " Netop . Friend . Call Captain ! " Peirce had gone to his quarters , but now reappeared , and recognized the Indian . " Ahoy there , Chickatabot , ye rascal ! " he shouted jovially . " I 'm back again , ye see . ' Ave ye beaver for me ? " He turned to the gaping English . " ' T is Sagamore Chickatabot , chief o ' these regions on the Bay . Lives by the Neponset River . A good Indian . Damme if ' e ' as n't got a fine mess o ' skins too . " For Chickatabot was pointing to a gleaming pile of fur in the bottom of his canoe , and crying , " Trade , Trade  --  " while he beamed up at the Captain.  | " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bless ye , sir  --  I should n't think so . They believe in a kind o ' Great Spirit called Manitoo , and a devil named Obbomock  --  that 's all I know . Say , ye rogue , " he called down . " Where 'd ye get the English clothes ? " Chickatabot nodded complacently and ran his hands over the gleaming buttons . " Governor give , " he said . Margaret drew a sharp breath . " Ask him if the Governor 's well ! " Peirce smiled and invited the Indians aboard , where communicationwas easier . They soon gathered that the Governor had been well when Chickatabot last saw him several sleeps ago . Margaret murmured a prayer of thanks and went to her cabin , followed by Martha who hated the way the Indians stared at the women . Elizabeth , though intensely curious , was overpowered by the Indian smell . Not the stink of unwashed bodies , she was used enough to that on shipboard , but a heavy animal scent augmented by the rancid grease in their hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his writing materials and listened , occasionally interrupting to ask the meaning of an Indian word , and write it down . Peirce finally traded three knives and six clay pipes for the skins , having sternly ignored all Chickatabot 's plaintive requests for strong water . " That 's one thing ye 'd best take note of , " Peirce said , eying the minister 's linguistic labors with some amusement . " Spirits sets Indians wild . They 've no ' cad for it . And do n't give ' em firearms neither . These Massachusetts are friendly knaves , but we must keep the upper ' and . " " I shall endeavor to do that by leading the poor innocents to Christ , " said Eliot smiling . " And I fear the early settlers have much wronged them . " Peirce scratched his nose and shrugged . " Mebbe so . Ye talk a'rnost like a parson I brought over ' ere last winter . Roger Williams'is name was . Claimed the King ' ad no right to give the land to the English , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should buy it ! Lot o ' contentious ideas ' e ' ad , and GovernorWinthrop was n't pleased . Last I ' card , Mr. Williams ' ad quitted the Bay Colony . " Elizabeth listened and was chilled . Here was still another man who had disagreed with Uncle John , and gone or been banished elsewhere . I 'll not be afraid of him , she thought . He ca n't force me to do anything I do n't want to . After all I am a Winthrop , and be 's never been overharsh to his own family  --  nor , she admittedafter thought  --  to anyone else that she knew . Yetp201Mirabelle had told her of a young man called Philip Ratcliffe , who had been brutally punished in Boston last June for criticizing the colony . He had had both his ears chopped off his head , and been shipped half dead to England . " They are saying in London , " Mirabelle had added , " that Governor Winthrop thinks himself a king , takes the law into his own hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This I find confusing since that was precisement the Puritans ' complaint against the established Church in England , when the Star Chamber chopped off Puritan ears . " Elizabeth also found it confusing , but thought Mirabelle dangerouslyoutspoken . " Do n't you fear for yourself in Massachusetts ? " she had asked , and Mirabelle laughed . " Ah ca , non . The Governor is a man , is he not ? " Elizabeth admired this superb confidence , but was unable to apply it personally . During the hours that they waited on the Lyon , her apprehensions grew , and were no less uncomfortable because she did not know what she feared except her uncle 's powerful will . She applied common sense to these forebodings , telling herself that Margaret and Jack loved Uncle John , that many of the Groton Manor folk had too , and reminding herself that on the night of the great tempest she had promised God  --  in the likeness of John Winthrop  --  to be obedient , and must fulfill her vow . Yet the unease continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself for battle . It was nearly dusk before the lookout raised a cry and they saw a large sailing shallop round the tip of Long Island . It flew the British ensign and was crowded with men amongst whom the Governor in black doublet trimmed with silver lace and wearing the sword of state was easily recognized . The Lyon set off three cannon in salute , and its passengers began to cheer . Margaret snatched little Sammy 's hand and hurried down to the main deck , Elizabeth carried Joan and was followed by Martha and Mary . Mirabelle tactfully held back with John Eliot until the family should be reunited . The sailors and common folk ranged themselves on either side the gangway , where the Captain stood with the Winthrop ladies . The bo'sun piped a patriotic tune as the Governor was assisted up the ladder , and stepped majestically onto the deck . He shook hands with the Captain , raised his arm slowly in greeting to all the shipload , then turned and looked at his wife , saying in a low voice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy moment . "  |p202He  has changed , thought Elizabeth , seeing that he held back from kissing Margaret as he had always done , and that consciousnessof his position gave him a new rigidity , but his wife crying out , " John , my dearest  --  " flew into his arms . And he did kiss her , though hurriedly , before picking up Sammy . Their two elder sons , Stephen and Adam , scrambled on board and ran to their mother . There was a babble of greetings and tears , but Winthropsaid , glancing at the watching crowd , " This is too public a place for reunion . Let us adjourn to the Great Cabin . " When they were sequestered , Winthrop became more natural . He kissed Elizabeth , Martha and Mary on the cheek . He admired Joan , his only grandchild so far . He put Sammy on his knee and stroked the little boy 's hair . He voiced his joy at their safe arrival , and uttered a long prayer of heartfelt thanksgiving in an unsteady voice . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes were tired , there were deeper wrinkles on his forehead , new gray in his hair and pointed beard . When Jack proposed a toast to their reunion , he shook his head . " No , my son , I no longer drink to anyone . It is frivolous and leads to inebriety . In fact I take no spirits nor tobacco now . I would prefer that my family did n't . Remember we set an example to the entire colony , and there is no sanction in Scriptures for strong waters , or smoking . " Jack put down his mug of weak brandy , and ventured to say , " There is none for beer either , sir , is there ? " " Precisely , " answered Winthrop . " So I do not drink it , though I have not yet been able to enforce this view . " I should hope not , thought jack dismayed . To deprive English folk of beer would be as galling as to forbid them bread . " Mr. Dudley , my deputy , combats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winthrop heavily . " Sometimes I feel he does not heed God 's clear directions as he should , yet ever pray that Mr. Dudley and I shall work together in Christian love . " jack was not at the moment interested in Thomas Dudley , so unpleasant did he find his father 's new convictions of the need for total abstinence . " But sir  --  " he cried , " Our Lord Jesus drank wine , and Paul said Use a little wine for thy stomach 's sake . ' " " For thy stomach 's sake , not for pleasure , " answered Winthrop , but he suddenly smiled , the rare sweet smile that few had seen . " Come , my son . This is no time for argument . You will do as conscience bids you . Where is the young minister , John Eliot ? We 're in sore need of him to preach in Boston , since Mr. Wilson is now in England . " Eliot was brought into the cabin , and conferred some time with Winthrop , and then after some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lady Gardiner , Your Worship . The first  --  that is , I mean to say , the French wife o ' Sir Christopher . " Elizabeth barely suppressed giggles , when she saw Mirabelle who had had ample opportunity on deck to size up the Governor and whose female instincts were infallible . From Elizabeth 's cabin she had filched a large demure collar which completely hid all the charms she usually displayed . She had braided her fiery hair and covered most of it with a kerchief . She had removed her lip paint . She walked in with downcast eyes , and curtseying low to Winthrop , seized his hand and kissed it . " Oh , your most honorable Excellency  --  " she faltered in a melting voice , " Do you know where is my so wicked husband , who has broken my poor heart ? " Margaret looked astonished , not having hitherto received this impression , but she chimed in kindly , " Poor Lady Gardiner . " Winthrop 's face darkened at Gardiner 's name . Sir Christopher had caused Winthrop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been exposed as a Papist and also as a spy for the wicked Sir Ferdinando Gorges who sat comfortably in England and plotted to seize all the country from Virginia to Quebec for himself . Yet Gorges had much noble backing , and Winthrop had not dared punish Sir Christopher as he deserved . Winthrop examined Mirabelle searchingly , and she gave him a lovely tremulous smile . He stood up and raised her from her curtsey . " You 've come in search of your husband , my lady ? " he said , his voice softening . As Mirabelle nodded , he went on . " My dear , I sorrow to tell you this , but he has gone , fled north to the country above Piscataqua that Sir Ferdinando Gorges claims  --  Agamenticus . I had Sir Christopher in detention here for  --  well , no matter  --  I would not cause you added pain . But he escaped , with the help of his  --  h 'm  --  of a young woman who claimed to be his cousin . " " Ah , quelle misere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she burst into most becoming tears . " There , there , " said the Governor patting her shoulder , and looking helplessly at Margaret . " Pray do n't weep . We 'll take care of you here , as long as you 'll stay . I 'm sure we can find room . " He checked himself , for in his unfinished Boston house there was certainly not room in view of all these new arrivals . " I 'll place you with some gently bred family who will respect your rank , your beauteous youth and your unhappiness . I shall personally interest myself in your welfare . " " How kind , how good you are ! " cried Mirabelle , sending Eliza/beth the tiniest flicker from the corner of her eye , that said , You see how easy it is to manage him . Elizabeth saw , and resolved that she would profit by the lesson . She too if need arose would be all soft pathos and tender submission . She would coax , flatter and weep ; her future would be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she would find new love , true love , at last and would marry when and as she pleased , but first perhaps she could enjoy herself in the adventurousnew land . Yet not an hour passed before all her resolutions were forgotten . Winthrop was to spend the night on board , but before he retired with Margaret , his respect for both ceremony and family ties prompted him to private interviews with his daughter Mary and his two daughters-in-law . He seated himself in the Captain 's chair and summoned the girls one by one , while the rest of the company chatted at the far end of the cabin . Elizabeth saw Mary 's serious face lighten with a contented smile while her father spoke with her . Martha blushed and looked delighted when Winthrop bade her officially welcome as his daughter-in-law , saying that he was sure she would make Jack a loyal wife . Elizabeth 's turn came last . She chided herself for previous anxiety when her uncle took the reluctant Joan from her arms and settled the child on his knee , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startle at your grandsir , " and he bounced Joan up and down and let her play with the silver buttons on his doublet . " She 's something like Henry , Bess , is she not ? " IIe said with a sigh , " You will have seen from my letters , how deeply I felt for you in that terrible affliction the Lord sent us all . " " Yes , my uncle , " she said softly . " You do not call me Father ' ? " he asked in faint reproof . " Yet that is what I am to you now , and I 've thought long for your future , as a father should . " Elizabeth stiffened , she felt her heart beat , yet remembered enough of Mirabelle 's example to lower her lids and say meekly , " Aye , my father , you are ever wise . " The lass had matured , thought Winthrop , gratified . God through affliction had much improved her . She was a trifle pinched and wan from the voyage , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly not repent of his generosity . " I was sorry to hear that you displeased Mr. Coddington , " he said , but kindly . " I thought the match most suitable . " " He displeased me  --  " she began , then bit her lips . " I 'm sorry , sir , that you were disappointed . "  | " No matter , it was doubtless the Lord 's all-seeing providence , for this match will do as well . " Elizabeth 's chin jerked up , she looked Winthrop full in the eye . " This WHAT , sir ? " " Why , this match , this marriage I have consented to for you . You must have known I 've worried about your situation , and would try to better it . Yet so few men in the colony are eligible . Mr. Robert Feake is  --  a young bachelor , church member , gentleman , and sufficiently well off to overlook the  --  the  --  well  --  smallness of your marriage portion . " Elizabeth clasped her hands and pressed them hard against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of this Mr. Fick , I suppose ? " Winthrop looked genuinely puzzled . " But he knows you . He speaks as though he 'd formed a deep attachment for you . I assumedyou had been in correspondence . " " You assumed wrong ! " she snapped and clenched her hands tighter , for they were trembling . Her tone was rude and Winthrop 's benignity faded . He put Joan on the floor , eying Elizabeth 's flushed face coldly . " Whether you know him or not , is immaterial since you soon will . And I 'm sure find him to your liking if the Devil does not tempt you into your old stubborn , headstrong ways . The matter has been arranged , and I know what 's best for you . " " You do n't . You do n't ! " she cried so wildly that the group at the other end of the cabin all turned their heads . Joan stared from her mother to her grandfather and began to wail . Winthrop rose , trying to master the uprush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other with the mutual antagonismwhich had always been latent , and Elizabeth 's eyes fell first . " We 'll speak no more of this tonight , " Winthrop said harshly . " I pray God will bring you to a better frame of mind , but in any case , the matter is decided . " He turned on his heel and walked over to the others . A flood of bewildered rage and fear choked in her throat as it had fourteen years ago at Groton , but she was twenty-one now and could not scream that she hated God , or run away , or swoon as she had then . She sat on the bench staring at a crack between the boards , until Martha came over to her . " Bess , dear  --  what is it ? How did you offend our father ? " " Leave me alone , Matt , " Elizabeth turned from her sister . " I must think  --  think what to do . "  |p206The  next morning the wind had veered to the east and blew them chilly rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship glided slowly through the islands and dropped anchor in Boston Harbor . The Captain ordered the longboat launched and handed the entire Winthrop family into it . He embarked himself , while the Lyon fired off seven cannon shots to apprise those on shore of the Governor 's arrival . Elizabeth was silent in the boat as she had been all morning beforeentering it . Through the night she had considered many fantastic plans for defeating Winthrop , but sober dawn had shown her that none were immediately feasible , and she had Joan to consider . There was nothing to do but wait until she understood conditionsin Boston , found out exactly what had become of her four hundred pounds , and try at least to control the situation without panic . But the inner turmoil precluded normal excitement over landing at last . She glanced almost indifferently at the misty silhouette of a three-mounded hill , and what seemed to be a cluster of small wooden huts near it , then back to the Lyon . The decks were filled with impatient passengers , who would presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw William Ballet , hanging over the rail . He extended his arm in a wave , quickly checked , as though he 'd thought better of it . She was too dejected to wave back , but the Governor 's sharp eyes had seen , and he turned to the Captain in surprise . " Was that long lad in the Monmouth cap waving at us ? It seems very forward . " " I believe ' e was , sir  --  " said Peirce . " ' T is a young joiner from Dorset , very popular on board , and ' andy with our repairs after the tempest . " " Indeed . An indentured servant , I presume . We 've had trouble with them . They turn lewd and brazen over here . " " ' E 's no servant , sir , " said Peirce . " Paid ' is own passage money , and talks a'most like a gentleman . Just a lad who wanted a change o ' scene . " Winthrop frowned . Footloose youths were not desirable members of the colony , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various landmarks ahead . The hill to the left where he intended to build a fort , as soon as possible , if Dudley would stop palisading Newtown across the Charles , and belligerently insisting that Newtown should be the capital . He showed her Trimount , the three-mounded hill , where they kept a sentry posted , and would burn a warning bonfire in case of danger , and another hill where he hoped that Jack would help erect a windmill.  | " And our house ? " asked Margaret faintly , gazing through the drizzle at the bleak , treeless peninsula . " There , " said Winthrop pointing . " On the flat near the meetinghouse . Oh , we 've near a score fine wood houses built , as you will see . Mr. Coddington , he 's started one of brick too , will finish it when he returns from England . " He glanced at Elizabeth 's set , withdrawn face , shadowed by the hood , and his lips tightened . " I 'm sure it looks like a sweet town , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth 's graceless behavior , and of John 's many other worries too . But she had finally managed to soothe him , and he had slept in her arms . The boat pulled up at a wooden pier , near which were crowded all the Bostonians and many from Newtown , Roxbury and Charlestownas well . The young men of the militia or train bands had drawn up in formation and now fired ceremonious volleys of gunshotinto the air . They had organized a fife and drum corps which began to play . Their captains , Underhill and Patrick , in polished armor , and plumed helmets , stood bowing at the head of the ladder . There were cheers and huzzahs and " God Bless You 's , " as Margaret stepped up behind her husband to the pier . Elizabeth followed with Joan . She did not look at the mass of curious , respectful , welcoming faces . She watched four halberdiers step up to Winthrop and range themselves importantly before him , also a liveried beadle who carried the Charter in a long leather box . Winthropsaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and his procession formed . The captains and the train bands started marching two by two . After them the halberdiers , the Governor 's guard of honor , then James Penn , the beadle , with the Charter which preceded Winthropon every ceremonial occasion , as a reminder of the authority invested in the Governor . Winthrop drew Margaret 's hand through his arm , and indicated to Jack that he and Martha should follow , and the other members of the family  --  in strict order of precedence . They all fell in and solemnly trudged up the muddy lane . " Journey 's end " indeed , Elizabeth thought as she marched . I have now arrived in the free , the glorious new land . The muddy lane was called King Street , and ended at the temporary church , a small thatched building with clay-daubed walls and no steeple . It stood at the junction with the High Street which led off the neck to Roxbury . But they did not march as far as the church before a portly gentleman on horseback came hurryingto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dudley , and the procession halted while he rode up to Winthrop.  | " Beg pardon for my tardiness , sir , " he said snatching off his black felt hat , " I was delayed at the ferry . ' Welcome , Madame , " he said to Margaret . " I trust the voyage was not too arduous . " She made a polite reply and gave him her usual sweet smile , but having heard from John of the constant friction between them , she decided that the man had a truculent coarse look . His jowled face was red above a grizzled beard . His swollen nose was laced with tiny purple veins . His rumpled brown cloak and mud-spattered boots exhibited none of John 's nice elegance . " Will you dine with me in Newtown , Mistress Winthrop ? " Dudley went on brusquely , " ' T is where you should be anyhow , and will , soon as the Governor 's finished his house there . ' T is the right place for our capital . " " I do not think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it here , and do n't intend to settle in Newtown . " " You agreed to ! " cried Dudley , beginning to breathe hard . His son Samuel , who was an officer in Underhill 's train band , seeing that his father was working into a choler , broke ranks and hurriedup . " His Worship 's family must be cold standing in the rain , my father , " he said quietly . " Shall I help you dismount ? " " No , Sam , " said Dudley controlling himself . " If the Governor and Mrs. Winthrop 'll excuse me , I have business in Muddy River . " He bowed , jerked the bridle and rode to the High Street . Sam Dudley gave Margaret an apologetic smile , and stared at the girls , especially Elizabeth , before he returned to his men . " Young Dudley seems a courteous personable gentleman , " remarkedMary , vaguely astounding Elizabeth who had never heard Mary praise any young man , but she was far too chilly and despondentto answer . The procession reformed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a rush-thatched , clapboarded house two stories high but otherwise about the size and shape of the washhouseat Groton . The windows had shutters but no glass . On the door made of three planks of unseasoned wood , little drops of sap had formed and mingled with the rain drops . The house stood starkly in a sea of mud and trampled weeds . " Our New England home , my dear , " said Winthrop . " I pray God will bless it , and make it a happy one . " Margaret pressed his arm , touched by his pride , aware of pathos too in the brave little procession , and John 's obvious pleasure in the honor the people accorded him , but as she looked at her new home she was appalled . Could he have so soon forgotten Groton that he really thought this ugly cot a fine house ! And it seemedp209that he had forgotten other things too . She had been shocked in the night to find that , after all , the churches here had patterned themselves after the Separatist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the franchise unless he first became a church memberand publicly attested to his salvation . There had been no plans so radical for the colony when John left England . Winthrop dismissed his guard and the family filed into the house , which was indeed large for Boston , since it had two twentyfootrooms in front and behind the central chimney . One was the Hall and the other the kitchen . Upstairs the space had been divided into four . Above that was a dark garret where the unmarried maidservants slept on pallets . The indentured male servants lived in a hut near the house . The Hall contained a long trestle table piled with offerings sent from all over the colony to greet the Governor 's family . There was poultry  --  partridges and geese , some unplucked , some already cooked ; a haunch of venison , apples , and a large cheese . Margaret gave an unfeigned cry of delight when she saw this , and Winthrop smiled complacently . " You see what joyous manifestation of love my people show me ! " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be gathered together at so few hours warn-ing . " To Elizabeth this speech was smug but her mouth watered as she looked at the food , and the gnawing in her stomach became so intense that she forgot her other problems until her uncle said , " We will eat nothing until certain guests have arrived  --  fasting is one of God 's most skilful means to chastise the flesh  --  Mr. Feake will dine here , Elizabeth , and I command that you treat him agreeably . " " I trust I know my duty to all your guests , sir , " she said ; and went upstairs to the room she would share with Mary . It was furnished with a crude wooden bedstead , roped for support of the bedding they had brought on the ship . There were two stools and nothing else . Though the servants had strewn a thick mat of rushes over the floor , it was very cold . Elizabeth opened the windowshutter and saw that the rain had stopped , patches of blue showed amongst the clouds . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then carried the child next door to Martha and Jack 's room , which was warmer , since it and the elder Winthrops ' room had a fireplace . " Keep Joanie for me , Matt , " she said . She shut the door on Martha 's anxious questions and went downstairs to the Hall , where she eyed the lavish display of food , hesitated , and cut herself a slice of cheese . She devoured it avidly , ate an apple , picked up a cold roast partridge and ate that.  |p210She  was sucking the last of its bones when John walked in with Margaret . Elizabeth was unable to control a guilty jump , and the childish impulse to hide the partridge leg behind her back , as Winthropsaid in an icy voice , " I ordered that no food be eaten until the guests arrive . " Margaret stepped forward quickly . " Indeed , John , you are too harsh . Bess needs strength for suckling her babe , and we have none of us eaten our fill in weeks . I too am famished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become to ruling every detail of his household and the colony that any doubts as to his judgment no longer troubled him . But with Margaret he was never unjust , and he said , " My dear , no doubt you 're right . Eat then , since you have such need . " He turned to Elizabeth , his eyes hardening again . " Why have you your cloak on ? I told you to make yourself ready for our company . " " There is nothing I can do , sir , since my chests have not yet been delivered from the Lyon . I wish to go outside and walk a bit , I 've been so long confined . " " True , " cried Margaret before her husband could speak . " Exercisewill benefit you , but be back soon . " As Elizabeth escaped , Margaret said in a low troubled voice , " John , be gentle with her , as you are with the rest of us . She 's not of a nature to be forced . " " And why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the child must be obedient to the father . You 're quick to plead for her , my dear wife , but forget that her immortal soul is imperiled by the faults she shows . Has she talked to you of her salvation ? Is she one of the elect ? Ilas the Lord Jesus marked her for himself ? " Margaret sighed , having often worried over Elizabeth 's lack of piety . " I believe not , but she will come to Him in time , for He is a loving God . " " He is a God of Wrath when Ile is mocked , " said Winthrop grimly . Elizabeth wandered down King Street towards the pier until she could see the Lyon rocking at anchor in the harbor . It would sail again in a fortnight . But how could I get on her ? Elizabeth thought . Not as a stowaway , concealment was impossible on that ship . As a passenger then ? But who would pay her fare ? And even were she to get aboard in some way , what awaited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butt of Aunt Lucy 's carping . Elizabeth thought seriously of Mirabelle 's method of living as she pleased . I 'm comely enough , she thought , but how did one get started ? How find men who lavished presents on one ,  |p211and  yet were as complaisant as Mirabelle 's lovers seemed to have been . Even as Elizabeth considered this , she grew more discouraged . For she had neither Mirabelle 's temperament nor upbringing . Besidesthere was Joan . She turned and walked back up the lane , the cold mud squelchingunder her shoes , but now that her stomach was full , she no longer shivered . She met two young menservants , who started to accost her , when one murmured to the other , " Wintrup ! " They touched their foreheads in respect and passed on . A goodwife in homespun cape came hurrying out of a tiny shop , whose bootshapedsign proclaimed a cordwainer . She stared at Elizabeth , and curtseyed , saying , " Good day , Mistress Wintrup , I saw ye land . " Elizabeth nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green before the meetinghouse there was a puny man standing in pillory , his head and arms thrust through the holes between the locked boards . There was a large placard on his back with the letter B on it in red . He was groaning feebly and shuffling his feet to ease his tortured muscles . Elizabeth paused . They had stocks in the churchyard at Groton , but she had never seen them used ; petty crimes had been fined , and serious ones sent to Hadleighfor punishment . " Goodwife  --  " called the man in pillory , seeing only her skirt and feet because his head was vised downward . " In mercy will ye tell me what o'clock it is ? " " About two , past noon , I think , " said Elizabeth gently , and as the man groaned again , muttering " Lord help me , " she said with pity , " How much longer have you to stand there , poor soul ? " " Till sundown . The pain 's so bad now , I doubt I can bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and the pillory too high for him , he was virtually hanging by his neck . She also saw a bit of plank leaning against an unfinished house across the High Street . She went and got the plank and put it under his feet . " God bless ye  --  lass , " he whispered , with a long sobbing sigh , as some of the strain eased . " I hope nobody saw ye do it . " " No , " she said . There was nobody in sight but some children playing ball near the town pump . " Forgive me , but why are you pilloried ? What does the B stand for ? " " Not buggery , " he said with a bitter laugh , " or they'd 've hanged me . The B 's for Blasphemy , you must be strange here not to know . "  | " I am , " she said , " and sad to find Boston stricter than ever Suffolk was . " " That 's it ! " he cried , trying to twist his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . D'ye know what I said ? I said I 'd left Englandto be rid o ' the God damn Bishops ' rule , and found myself worse off here under the God damn Brethren 's rule , and I say it again . " " Ah  --  " she murmured after a moment . " Then why do you stay ? " " Ye may be sure I wo n't if I can help it . But winter 's no time to be starving alone in the wilderness , and every place in the Bay 's as bad . Come spring , I 'll get me up to Piscataqua where they leave a man 's soul be , if he 's willing to work . . . Ye 'd best move on from here , gentle lass  --  " he added quickly , " The guard 'll be making rounds and nobody 's allowed to talk to prisoners . " Elizabeth walked slowly down the High Street , past a few new houses , and struck off on a path which led towards Trimount or Sentry Hill and the Common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of the man in pillory had closed still another imagined avenue of escape . No , winter was no time to be starving alone , or with Joan , in the wilderness . She came to the burying ground which was enclosed by a sapling fence . Alreadythere were over thirty headstones in it . She leaned her elbows on the fence and looked at them . The most elaborate one commemorated Isaac Johnson , the next stone was for Mary Coddington , and then an infant , Edward Aspinwall . The rest were wooden slabs , with hasty carving . " Have you melancholy thoughts , Mistress , so soon after landing ? " said a diffident voice beside her . She turned to see a slight young man well dressed in black cape and plum-colored doublet fastened with tiny gold buttons . As she looked at him in surprise , he removed a fine beaver hat , which disclosed short cut flaxen hair , so light it was almost white . His features were neither large nor small , his eyes pale blue set between pale lashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt them . He was smiling in a timid , anxious way as though begging her not to resent his having spoken , and she was quick to put him at his ease . " I scarcely knew what I was staring at , " she said . " But perhaps my thoughts WERE melancholy . " " I 'm  --  I 'm deeply sorry to hear it , " he said with so much emotionthat for the first time in two days she felt like laughing . " I know what melancholy is , I would never have you suffer from it . " " ME ? " she said . " La ! Sir , do you always flatter ladies so , on first acquaintance ? "  |p213His  face fell . He moistened his lips and said very low , " ' T is not first acquaintance , Mistress Winthrop . I sold you that brooch you 're wearing . " She looked down at Harry 's gilt and crystal gift . " The goldsmith  --  " she murmured , groping . " The goldsmith  --  on LombardStreet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of finding the gaudy brooch so cheap , the excitement and passion that quivered between her and Harry . She did n't remember the goldsmith at all . " Aye , " he said , in the same anxious tone of apology . " I am Robert Feake , I  --  I 've never forgotten you . " Elizabeth took a quick breath and stepped back , staring with more amazement than indignation . When Winthrop first mentioned his plans for her marriage , she had pictured Feake in the likeness of William Coddington , or at any rate as a burly domineeringman whose arrogance and self-interest had deceitfully leagued him with the Governor into pretense of affection which he could not possibly feel . The reality was a startling contrast to her fancy . This was a delicate-appearing man scarcely taller than she , nor could he possibly be out of his twenties , though his pale hair and lack of beard might make him look younger than he was . His clothes were fresh and spotless . She caught from them a whiff of lavender . He had withdrawn one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her scrutiny with obvious unease . She saw that the long sensitive hand was white as the Earl of Thanet 's had been , and moreover Feake 's fingernails were clean . In that first moment of shock , her heightened senses received three strong impressions . He had been hurt at some time , and was afraid of being so again , beyond that she felt a strange quality , eldritch , fey  --  an echo from the fairy tales of changelings her Suffolk nurse had told her . And the third impression startled her most , for the look in his light blue , occasionally blinking eyes seemed very like pleading tenderness . " You say nothing . . . " he said at last , with a sigh . " Do you know something to my discredit ? Have I offended ? " " Aye , " she said , smiling faintly . " You had no right to speak of  --  to speak intimately about me to Governor Winthrop , nor give him to think that I knew you . " He swallowed ; pink stained his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I but said I admired you and grieved to hear of your widowhood . I would n't have presumed to say more . It was he who mentioned that you must marry again after landing , since women need pro/tectors in this wild place . It was he who hinted subtly , and then as I still dared not think  --  he asked me straight out if  --  " " Aye . No doubt he did , " she cut in dryly . " But I believe you will understand my displeasure at being told I had no choice , that my marriage had been arranged . " " I do , " he said humbly . " I never meant it like that , nor will I thrust myself on you . I know nothing of women . With none have I aspired to be a husband , nor would have now  --  much as I 've cherished you in memory  --  except the Governor . .. " " Yes . Yes . I know , " said Elizabeth with exasperation . He stooped and picked up the glove he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he said turning away . " I expected nothing else . " " Oh , fiddle ! " cried Elizabeth , half laughing , so harmless had this opponent turned out to be . " How do I know whether I can abide you or not , Mr. Feake ? I do n't know anything about you , yet admit to some curiosity  --  but we must hurry back and dine , it 's never well to keep the Governor waiting . " " You are even lovelier than I remembered , " said Feake in a muffled voice as they began to walk , " and I 've thought of you so often . " She did not answer , being much perplexed , and conscious chiefly of respite . His compliment and the devotion in his eyes were naturally not unwelcome ; more welcome yet was a sense of power , a sweet she had never tasted with Harry  --  or Jack . The thought of Jack brought its customary miserable pang , and she hastened to efface it by asking questions of Robert Feake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned the outward facts of his life . He was twenty-nine years old , and had been born in Norfolk , but apprenticed at thirteen to his father , James Feake , who had been a wealthy goldsmith in London . Robert inherited from his father not only the business , but Puritan leanings , which brought him in contact with Emmanuel Downing , and eventually John Winthrop . He had loaned them money from time to time , and eventually bought shares in the Massachusetts Bay Company . " I marvel , Mr. Feake , " she said , " In view of what you tell me , that you left England for this raw , uncomfortable land  --  was it conscience ' sake ? " Not a yearning for adventure surely , she thought , nor for gain , nor did he seem the type of man to have been galled by religious oppression . He was silent so long that she turned to look at him , and saw confusion in his face , almost fear . He glanced sideways at her ,  |p215and  spoke hurriedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It  --  I was n't well , an ague , I think  --  yes  --  that was it , it must have been an ague . My memory is clouded of that time . Forgive me . " " What for ? " she said , pitying his confusion . " I did n't mean to pry . And agues with their fevers often haze the memory . " " London air is unhealthy , " he said in the same harsh hurried voice . " ' T is better here . I feel better . I was too confined in London . " As he spoke , they passed the man in pillory , and Elizabeth glancing at the prisoner , shook her head . " I trust Boston 'll not grow too confining also . " " Nay , " he said eagerly and his face cleared . " If you would , Mistress  --  if you should ever think to join your lot with mine , it need not be in Boston . I have fair land at Watertown . I 've started a house by the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The minister , Mr. Phillips , rules with a gentle hand . " " In neither Groton nor London where I 've lived , did the ministersrule at all , " said Elizabeth , " but I see that you understand certain things about me very well . " They had turned down the lane and were in front of Winthrop 's door before he murmured in answer . " I understand , I think , because I love you , " he spoke so low that she barely heard , then she stopped and stared at his averted face . The ensuing dinner was pleasant . Winthrop had favored Elizabethwith one startled approving glance when she came in with Robert Feake , and he placed the two side by side at table . He asked the blessing on their meal , and forgot all domestic matters , in the larger interests of listening to Captain Peirce 's news from England , and discussing letters the Lyon had brought . Margaret had prevailed upon her John to serve canary wine at least for this reunion , and as their great pewter tankard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was consumed , Winthrop relaxed into geniality . He enjoyed being a host , and his ever-anxious conscience produced no conflict between the ingrained traditions of the Englishsquire and Biblical injunctions  --  which approved hospitality . His eyes moistened proudly as he glanced at Margaret beside him , and down the long trestle table at his children and his guests . These included besides Captain Peirce and Robert Feake , his colony assistants  --  Sir Richard Saltonstall who had come down river from Watertown and was returning to England on the Lyon , Mr. Increase Nowell , Mr. William Pynchon , and Simon Bradstreet , Dudley 's young son-in-law . Mirabelle also contributed top216the general glow . She was charming and told tactfully edited anecdotes of her life in London and Paris . She flattered all the men , and got her own way as usual . Winthrop had decided to board Lady Gardiner with the Aspinwalls , whom he considered the most suitable family in Boston for her reception . Mirabelle had other ideas . She too had been out walking that afternoon and she too had encountered a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come , as she later told Elizabeth , to an instant understanding . " I like soldiers , " Mirabelle said with her throaty chuckle . " I like thees one . He is big and strong , he has a naughty eye . Also he like me . So I decide to board with him while I stay in Boston . " " But he has a wife , has n't he ? " asked Elizabeth , slightly dazed as always by Mirabelle . " Of course . Or it would not be comme it faut . A fat Dutch cow of a wife , but a good cook . I am comfortable . And I amuse myself . " The two young women had met by chance on the Common where the train bands were drilling to the pleasing tootle and thump of the fife and drum corps . It was Friday , November 11 , a week afterthe Lyon had landed , and a holiday , since the Governor had proclaimedit a Day of General Thanksgiving . In the morning Eliot had prayed and lectured in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxation was permitted . The weather was warm and misty ; most of the town had taken to strolling around the Common . Aside from the marching train bands there was n't much to look at but the cattle which had been driven onto the Neck for wintering and a little pond on which children were pokingat chip boats with birchbark sails ; but Elizabeth was relieved to be outside . There had been a great deal of work to do this week in the Governor'scrowded house . The servants were so few compared to Groton and three of the maids they had brought were sick . Sally had collapsed the day they landed . It was obvious that she had scurvy , her teeth were loose , her breath fetid . She lay on her palletin the garret and moaned for Suffolk . Elizabeth had brewed scurvy grass for her but she was not yet improved . Mary too was sickly , and on Margaret , Elizabeth , and Martha had devolved much manual labor to which they were unaccustomed . They had had to help the one remaining maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porridge made from the unfamiliar and  --  to the newcomers  --  extremely unpalatable Indian corn meal . Worst of all they had had to launder the mountains of filthy linen which had accumulated on the passage over.  | " I wish I could amuse myself , " said Elizabeth wistfully , as she and Mirabelle paused to watch a group of lads playing at stoolball . " And this place is so dreary . " She looked around the muddy , treeless Common with the great three-crested hill lowering against a dun sky . " Mirabelle , why do you stay ? You do n't have to . " Mirabelle glanced at the helmeted figure of Captain Underhill who was cursing his raw recruits in fluent Dutch fortunately not intelligible to the godly spectators . " The Captain makes love very well , for an Englishman , " said Mirabelle shrugging , " but I think you are right . I leave soon to find my Christophe . Underhill say I shall find him at Piscataqua , and that he has married off his doxy to someone else ; that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you go to that wild northland alone ? " Elizabeth cried . " It 's only about two days sail , cherie  --  and Underhill know of a trading shallop which will take me . " Elizabeth was smitten with envy and a sense of loss . Without the gaudy shameless Mirabelle , Boston would be dreary indeed . " Could n't you take me too ? " she whispered hopelessly . " Non , non  --  ma pauvre . One must be practique . You could not bring your baby , and you would be miserable running away from your family like that  --  the good Margaret , your sister , and Monsieur Jack  --  ah , but THAT is finished , is n't it ? At least the little sister has won , though she never knew she was fighting , and you would not . It will be a marriage now for them  --  comme les autres  --  not very good , not very bad . And for you too there must be marriage . I see no other way . " Elizabeth drew a sharp breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I know . But you will be out from under his thumb . Take this Monsieur Feake who looks at you with the eyes of a faithful dog . I told you on the ship you need a man you can manage , and now here is one , surely . " " I do n't love him , " said Elizabeth dully , staring at the ground . " Though I do n't find him exactly displeasing  --  but there 's somethingstrange about him , so pale and meek  --  yet sometimes I feel that  --  " " Sacre nom ! " cried Mirabelle , interrupting with vehemence . " How hard you make everything for yourself , you and all these Puritans ! You look behind , you look before , you ask the moon , then think it wicked . Here is a man who is in love with you . And me , I find him interesting  --  these frail silvery types are sometimespiquant  --  there was a young Swede in Paris  --  enfin , no matter . This Feake is rich enough and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can certainlytolerate the young man , and if he bores you , distract yourselfelsewhere , voila tout . " Elizabeth gave a small bitter laugh , and did not answer . But her resistance to Robert was ebbing . She longed for a place of her own , and to be out of Boston . Nor was she impervious to the joy that she could apparently confer on Robert if she consented . She had seen him twice since the first meeting , and always he was gentle and mutely adoring . Sometimes he attracted her , yet sometimes she felt a subtle shrinking , and heard a warning toll , far off and meaningless as church bells in a distant town . I do n't know what to do , she thought , and the lifetime instinct of her heart prompted the only solution . She would consult Jack . Privacy was nearly as impossible in the Governor 's house as it had been on shipboard , and Elizabeth waited several days before she realized her wish . It was not only their tacit avoidance of each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse , investigating the other plantations , or surveying the probable sites of the fort and windmill , or conferring with Captain Peirce who was shortly to leave for England via Virginia . Her chance came at last on the night that Governor Bradford of the Plymouth Colony sailed into the harbor and came ashore to pay his fellow governor a visit . Winthrop , much pleased , conducted Bradford around Boston that afternoon , and Jack remained in the Hall to write letters at his father 's desk . Elizabeth escaped from the kitchen where the other women were bustling to prepare a special dinner for Bradford and walked resolutelydown the other room towards Jack . " I wanted to speak to you , alone , " she said , " To consult you . " She saw the stiffening of his dark mobile face , and a veiled look cloud his brown eyes as she came up to the table , and knew that she showed the same constraint . " But , of course , Bess , " he said quickly . " Is it about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not try a laudanum clyster ? I have some laudanum in my surgery chest . Has she been bled properly ? " " Aye , " said Elizabeth . " And Sally mends , now . ' T is not that . " " What then ? " he asked , as she paused . She disturbed him as she stood there looking her prettiest . All the Winthrops wore their finest clothes in honor of Governor Bradford . She was dressed in a maroon taffeta gown , looped back to show a quilted yellow petticoat . Her sheer lawn collar and cuffs were trimmed with a finep219edging of gold lace . Her hair fell in black ringlets on her forehead and shoulders and the rest was pinned into a high glossy knot . She was still thin , but the vivid rose had returned to her cheeks , and the luster to her long hazel eyes . He had not truly looked at her in weeks , and did not wish to now , though the sensations she had used to arouse in him , he believed entirely conquered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jabbed his pen sharply into the little noggin of shot . " Whatever is it ? " he repeated . " It 's about Robert Feake , " she answered at last . " Did n't you guess ? " His restless hand stilled . The sudden pain he felt dismayed him . " You are going to wed him ? " he asked in a toneless voice . " I do n't know . Your father orders it . What do you think ? " Unwillingly he raised his eyes again and they looked at each other . The thought of the last evening in England on the beach at Sandwich cut down between them like a sword , and they both turned away . She walked to the fire and stood gazing at the cracklingpine logs . He sat on at the table staring at his half-written letter . But there was far more between them than forbidden passion , or even the compelling ties of kinship . Beyond these were the golden memories of their childhood 's affectionate trust , and in them both was bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Do you dislike Mr. Feake , Bess ? " She shook her head . " But I feel some singularity  --  some mysteryabout him . Do you know why he left England ? " " Why , for the same reasons we all did , no doubt , " answered Jack thinking this foolish question an evasion . He went on anxiously . " Is there someone else you wish to marry ? Are you unhappy here ? Remember Edward Howes still loves you . He told me so in London . Would you go back to him ? " Elizabeth laughed on a weary note . " Oh , Jack  --  spare me EdwardHowes again , I beg . Do n't you remember how you urged him on me before you sailed to the Levant ? " " Aye , I remember . " He picked up the poker and turned a log . " I was a fool , Bess . If I had thought  --  if I had spoken then  --  if I had stayed  --  or asked you  --  " " Hush , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " None . " He put the poker in the great fieldstone hearth . " Yes , my little coz , I think you should marry Robert Feake . My father knows what 's best . " She sighed . " So everyone says  --  Jack , what has happened to **31;11246;TOOLONG to the slant of her eyes ; which could hardly have been the case , as I had out of curiosity tried it in front of a mirror with such hair as there is of my own . She raised her eyes and I abruptly did mine , meeting myself in the mirror that hung , tilted slightly downward , in the wall directly behind her . Mackerel has a long , slender face , its rather peevish constituents relieved by red cheeks and blue eyes that have often been termed " boyish . " Round and yearning , they stand out , among the drawn intellectual 's lineaments , like eggs in the wrong nest . Such , at least , is the way my wife once described them . " They 've got a brand new shovel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon . " " They have ? " " Centapong 's hardware store donated it special for the occasion . We 'll pick it up on the way down . " " Will I have to dig the whole hole ? " " I do n't think so . There 'll be several selectmen there and maybe even the mayor . You can all pitch in . " I drank off my coffee , set my cup down and pushed my chair back an inch or two . " Hester , I want to talk to you about all that . Not plantingthis tree in itself  --  that 's a nice thing and very sweet of the Brownies  --  but the whole attitude of yours behind it . Frankly , it worries me . " " What do you mean by that , Andrew ? " " Is n't it your idea ? To do this I mean ? " She nodded , a spoon with a stewed fig on it halfway to her mouth . " Yes . Different organizations are putting in new trees after that hurricane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give one this way . Why ? " I paused , wondering if I should have gotten into this . My relations with her were so complex , for one thing . It didn'tp51seem right calling a housekeeper by her first name , yet it would have been idiotic , and in any case too late , to go back to calling her Miss Pedlock . I therefore did my best to imbue her first name with its equivalent in formality . I must keep my distance , especially if I nursed dreams of terminating her tenure and clearing the decks generally for a successor who was to be my wife . She had passionately declined wages , which I as angrily kept accumulating in escrow . Well , it was too late to retreat now .. . " It is n't remembering your sister as such that I 'm thinking of , but the other side of that coin  --  burying yourself alive in so doing . I know you loved her , as we all did , but in your case I 'm afraid I 'm beginning to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can you say that , Andrew ? " she said , lowering the fig back into its dish . " With the greatest of difficulty , my dear , but also with the best heart . How else is your behavior since her death to be interpreted ? You devote yourself day and night to her cause  --  " " The clinic is important . " " You 'll wind up well inside it if you do n't watch out . You keep the house exactly as she did , follow her routines . It 's as though you were trying to step into her shoes . " I had risen to pour myself more coffee , and now returned the pot to the stove . " Her favorite flowers in their accustomed place ! " I exclaimed with a gesture toward a vase of roses on the livingroom piano . As we looked , one or two petals fluttered to the keyboard , as if shaken by the force of my remonstrance . " If that is n't living with a ghost , what is ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hester dropped her gaze and twisted a ring on her finger . " Well , you 're not a girl now , you 're a grown woman ofp52twenty-eight or so . You 've got to come out of your shell and live your own life . Let the dead bury their dead . ' Jesus tells us that . So not resuming our life where it was interrupted is n't just psychologically bad  --  it 's a sin . " She continued silent a moment , her head hung . I sat down in my chair again , without immediately drinking my coffee . " Do n't you have any boy friends ? " I asked at length . The head shook . Finding this point difficult to pursue with any intelligence , I dropped it and reverted to the enumeration of symptomswhich I found alarming . " You wear black . " " Maybe that 's slenderizing . " " But you 're thin as a rail as it is , girl ! " I picked my napkin up and slammed it down again . " My dear  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the jangle of the telephone in the next room . " I 'll get it , " she said rising , and raced me for it with friendly hilarity . I picked up another brioche , broke the nipple from it and sat munching it moodily . I could hear Hester but not distinguish what she was saying . It sounded businesslike and formal ; not a personal call . She returned presently and said , " Just a new member . Another transfer from poor M.F. A Molly Calico , " she read from a slip , which she then set down on the table beside my elbow . " That 's her address . Be sure and put her on your list to call on . " I picked up my cup and carried it to a bird cage in which two cut-throat finches pecked and fluttered and spat music at disorganized intervals . I stood tweezing my lips at them , whistling a few bars . " Were there any other calls ? " I said . " Like last night ? "  | " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was ver urgent . He seemed upset again . " " What did you tell him ? " " That you were out on Kingdom work . " I squeezed the ear of my cup hard in my fingers , any ( ( raised it to drink . The front doorbell rang . It was the mailmanand , setting my cup down , I beat Hester to that . I sat down in the living room to read my mail , breathing rather heavily from the exertions of the morning . I read two personal letters and glanced at some advertising matter . When at last I looked up , it was to see Hester standing at the window looking out . She was shaking her head . This was so long after the last words between us that I thought she had stationed herself there to deplore the view . " I just do n't understand you , " she said . " First you say you hate fat in any shape , manner or form . The next thing you want me to go putting on weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do as you think best about that , Hester , " I said , and rose , pocketing such mail as was first class . I went to the vestibule and got my coat and hat . " Where are you going ? " she said . " Out . " " Well , if that 's where you 're going , you 'd better wear your muffler . It 's cold . " " I do n't need any muffler . I 'm just going to make a few calls . " She followed me into the vestibule . " Do n't be late . We 've got to be there at a quarter to three , so that means we ought to leave here no later than twothirty . And what about dinner tonight ? It should be somethingsimple . Do you like codfish balls ? " " I do n't know , I 've never attended any , " I said , recalling ap54joke from an old college revue , and , laughing unco-operatively , hurried out the door and down the porch steps into the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , thrusting her head out the door , she called after me in friendly sport , " Anyhow , I 'm glad you like my brioches ! " I had been inside Molly 's house only twice , after dates , and had never picked her up there but always met her at our rendezvous . The two times she had asked me in there had been nobody home . The idea of her having parents had therefore never crossed my mind , and so , in the excitement of my approach to her door , I was surprised to find it opened by a plump , very nearly perfectly round little woman in a knit shawl , wearing gold-rimmed eyeglasses . " Yes ? " she said . " I 'm Andrew Mackerel  --  of People 's Liberal Church ? To See Miss Calico ? " " Oh , yes . She 's not home . But come in anyway . " " Not home ? " " She 's out of town . " " But she called only this morning ... " " She went to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the theater . That 's one thing she likes about your church  --  such a wonderful theater . Do come in and we 'll have a nice chat ourselves . " The parlor into which I was ushered was one about which I had twice had occasion to marvel , even from what I could see of it in the dark . In broad daylight I had all the more reason . It was furnished on the requirement , dear to the New England mind , of everything 's having once been something else . A coffee table was a former cobbler 's bench , a lamp an erstwhile coffee grinder , andirons were bronzep55cherubs that had in a previous existence supported coach lights . The room was fragrant with flowers and plants that ascended , in each case , from something other than a vase . There were spice jars from which sprouted tongues of green ; a glazed porcupine bristled with kitchen matches . It amazed me that Molly Calico could come of stock exemplifiedby this taste , until I remembered with a jolt my own . Nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce their opposites . The sovereign motif here was Coziness , to which Mrs. Calico herself in no small degree contributed . I was a few mesmerized minutes putting my finger on the exact bell she rang , but after watching her execute a few stitches of the knitting she busied herself with while we " sat , " I had it . It was of the animal illustrationsin bedtime stories that she reminded you . She looked precisely like some clothed and bespectacled forest creature sniffing and philosophizing in its chimney corner . She was Mrs. Tiggy-winkle , who did the washing in the Beatrix Potter books . Or Tabitha Twitchet , who ran the grocery store and did not give credit ; or Goody Tiptoes , or all these rolled into one : an anthropomorphic thing in a ruffed gown and , at night of course , a lace cap . Already I could see her pushing moss under the thatch with her nose to keep us snug all winter . " Now then . " She composed herself with a wriggle . " I like the church becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , hooking up a strand of yarn with her little finger . I saw her smile downward , and deduced that a cat was playing at her feet . It would explain the abundance of hairs that compromised an otherwise immaculate room . " There 's a going-back-to-old-ways feeling in the air , " Mrs. Calico went on as her needles flew . " Even the winters we 're getting are old-fashioned , if you know what I mean . "  | " I think I do , " I said . " Snow is what it was under McKinley . " She put her knittingby and rose , not that it materially altered our eye levels . " Now then , what will it be  --  tea or coffee ? " " Either one , " I said . " It makes no difference to me . " " Then a nice pot of tea it shall be on this cold , nasty day , " she said , and disappeared in a manner that made her seem to have been drawn from the room on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet high and her skirt fell so nearly to the floor that her feet were unseen , as well as undoubtedlyshod in felt . She flowed without apparent effort and certainly without sound from my presence , the cat capering in her wake . She was gone a long time . A tall clock ticked in the hall . I stared at the starched lace curtains hanging stiff as iron down the clean windows . I had the illusion of being a visiting rabbit , whose own feet did n't quite touch the floor . Out of the tail of my eye I caught the gaze of a general in oils , a man who resembled the Kaiser , though dressed in Americanregalia . It was an archaic uniform , and the manner in which one gloved hand rested on a sheathed saber conveyed a sense of old turmoils and crowned accomplishments . What came into my mind was what William Jennings Bryan had exclaimed in a Chautauqua oration on the eve of our entrance into the First World War : " The quickest way out of this is straight through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacart hove into view , laden with goodies . " The important thing is roots , " Mrs. Calico said , trundlingthe cart to her chair . I had the sense of being unable to rise , or if I did , that it would be to find myself on all fours and only eight inches high . " From the day I married poor Willard  --  that would be Molly 's father , who ran away to seap57when he was forty-two and she was twelve  --  it was apparent . I try to tell Molly this . Restlessness is the curse of our time . Put down roots , belong . My husband had been.a rover  --  he was a commercial traveler  --  but he thanked me for gettinghim settled , at least till he ran away for good . I did that for him . I gave him roots . " I was tempted to ask whether she cooked them any specialway . Indeed , I wondered if I was n't about to be served them myself . However , a slice of pound cake came my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiled . " It was touch and go though , at first , " Mrs. Calico mused . " He very nearly drew out the gypsy in me instead . The way he acted on me was amazing . " " Sort of a catalytic agent . " " Well , he was an agent for Standard Oil , was what he was , and that had pretty much taken him around the world . So he 'd had it , ' as you young people say today , and why should n't he now put down roots rather than pull mine up ? At any rate , he came to thank me for it in later years , " she concluded rather shrilly . I took another cup of tea and another slice of pound cake , resisting the bread and jam offered as option . I tugged my vest down over my tummy , half expecting to find a gold chain there and a watch which I would pull out and exclaim , " Goodness , I must go . Mrs. Woodchuck will be furious . " Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to join your church , Reverend Pickerel . " " You are ? " She nodded brightly , smiling . " Our old Reverend Yarrow is gone and I have really no more feeling for M.E. I 've heard so much about People 's Liberal and everything they do and this wonderful clinic and all . It 's what we need , it really is . Tell me , do you direct the dramas too ? "  | " No . We have a man named Todarescu for that . Do n't you know him ? " " Todarescu . . . " She looked at the ceiling in the effort to recall . " Where have I heard that name ? " " He 's a foreigner , Mrs. Calico . Not our sort really , but he does his job . I thought he might be the one who took Molly to New Haven this morning . " " It might very well be he . She 's out so much . A fine , healthy , popular girl . Tell me , what play are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not for Frying  --  I mean The Lady 's Not for Burning , " I said . " It 's by Christopher Fry . Dear me , what am I saying , all sixes and sevens today . Anyhow , it 's written in poetry . Or a kind of poetry . " Mrs. Calico wet a finger end and blotted up the last crumbs from her cake plate . " Poetry went to the dogs under the Taft administration , " she stated . " Modern poets have nothing whatever to tell us . " " You 're so right . I was saying only the other day to Mrs. Wilkins , they only write for each other . Well then , why publishit ? Why not just send it to one another in letters ? " I should have liked nothing better than to sit in this room while the clock ticked on and the sun 's angle steepened along the figured rug , discussing the Taft administration and the emergence of vers libre under the rotten mob , drawing Mrs. Calico out on this and many other subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But after a few minutes I rose with the protest that I simply must go . Other forest folk expected me . " Well , it 's been such a nice visit , " Mrs. Calico said . " Andit wo n't be the last of our little chats either , never fear , because I 'll tell you something . When I join something , I join . " She led the way into the vestibule , where I got into myp59overcoat . She watched me put it on , her hands folded above her stomach , smiling . " I 'll tell Molly you called , but do n't worry of that slugabedgirl is n't up on time for service tomorrow . I 'll be there . And I 'm so glad you believe in being active in all of life , Brother Halibut . Because after all , that 's what Jesus wants us to do , is n't it ? "  |p60THANK  God you 've come . " Turnbull took my hat off and unwound the muffler from around my neck . He drew off my overcoat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed even more agitated than usual , but I was prepared for this by the breathless telephone summons I had received on my returnhome from the tree-planting ceremony . He failed to wrest from my grasp a pair of pigskin gloves , which I myself tucked into an overcoat pocket . " Maybe now you 'll admit there 's a righteous God , " he said as he led the way into the living room . " When you hear what I 'm going to tell you . " I took my customary chair and prepared for another rehearsalof past rascalities , with details more graphic than most . " Maybe now you 'll believe in an Old Testament God who visits the sins of the fathers upon the children , unto the third and fourth generation . " This was a new note . I steeled myself now for a tale of adolescent misdeed . Turnbull had a boy of seventeen , Steve , in his last year at Andover . The youth must have gottenp61into a scrape of some sort , perhaps with a girl . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Is it Stevie ? " I said . " What 's he done ? " Turnbull took something from a table beside his chair and tossed it into my lap . Picking it up , I saw it to be a small book bound in limp leather , privately printed . It was by Steven Turnbull . The title was Some Notes Toward an Examination of Possible Elements of Unconscious Homosexualityin Mutt and Jeff . " It 's my punishment , " Turnbull said . " And I had such high hopes for the lad . He would continue his psychology studies , get involved with some nice girl and settle down and work here at the clinic maybe . But this . " " Now , now , calm yourself , " I said . " It may not be as bad as you think . " I knew the boy had been interested in the American comic strip , and bringing the analytic technique to its study would certainly be nothing new . I told Turnbull this and added , " Maybe he was assigned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , but they could pick their own subject . And why would anyone pick that unless they were personally  --  Then the term paper was rejected and he wanted to have it privately printed . I gave him the money , how did I know what it was ? Look at the dedication , " he finished bleakly . I had been paging through the monograph , my eye caught by lines like , " Though Mutt is married , his wife rarely figures in the action . He appears generally to be living in shared quarters with Jeff . . . " I turned to the front and read the dedication . It said , " To Cyril Sharpe . " " Who is that ? " I asked . " His roommate . Some character with a fear of italics or some damn thing . Oh , God , is this what I deserve ? "  |p62I  thought it wise to pause and take up that question nonrhetorically . " For one thing , " I said , putting the booklet by , " boys going off in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pattern themselves after . Have you offered him a stable masculine example ? " Turnbull met this with a smile of ironic tolerance , even pity . " Stable masculine example . I was only always high-tailing it after everything in skirts , that 's all . Rutting about the continent , chasing one woman after another . Stevie knew that . What more example do you want ? " I let that pass and pursued another aspect of the matter . " How about his relations with his mother ? " I asked . " She died when he was five , of course . After that I was a single man , which was partly why I lived the life I did . He was raised by a succession of nurses . " He heaved a great sigh and parted his hands in a gesture . " I do n't know whether that 's supposed to cut any ice in these cases . " " I 'll try to find out , but let 's not go calling it a case yet , Turnbull . Let 's pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would you like me to call on him ? I 'm going to Boston shortly , and I could stop around that way . " " I 'd appreciate that . Or he may come home for the holi-days . " I left presently , having other calls to make , and he saw me to the door . " When you do see Stevie , " he said , winding the scarf around my neck , " do n't make it too obvious that you 're spying . Be casual . " " Of course . And meanwhile do n't you worry about those arty fancies . Boys will be boys . " " That 's all I ask . " Turnbull stepped back to see whetherp63he had my hat on straight , bending his knees to bring himself down to my level . Walking out to the porch , he apologizedfor not having reached a decision about the memorial . " I 've been too upset , " he said . " But I 'll hit on something soon , and the minute I do I 'll call you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush . " " One idea I did have was signs , yes , but clever . Like Have you been living it up ? Jesus will help you live it down . ' What do you think of that ? " " Forget about Jesus , and about signs too . Try to get a whole new viewpoint , " I said , and fled down the stairs . I was back in the heart of my problem . ' Which was , in a nutshell , to take a second wife while the town was still so First-Mrs . Mackerel-conscious . Holding one 's emotions poised to strike at the earliest possible moment consonant with propriety , this was wearing enough without its even more ticklish corollary , keeping Molly interested , willing to " wait " till that psychological moment was reached . Every time I saw her leave the Players with Todarescu it struck me the more acutely that time was running out . He had given her the lead in the Fry piece , for reasons perhaps not altogetherbased on suitability , but in doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brains for ways and means of recovering it . One evening as I was climbingout of the plastic bubble in front of the parsonage , I saw them emerge from the side door of the auditorium and walk toward the Jaguar , parked just behind me . There was no way of avoiding a meeting , and I went over to them . Todarescu had his usual dark vitality , with a bright neckerchiefglimpsed under his coat and the sudden , spastic smile , with its reminder of barbaric pasts . He removed and explainedfor us a new foam rubber cap of the kind that can ,  |p64in  summer , be soaked in ice water and remain cool on your head indefinitely . It continued to be the theme of forced pleasantries long after he had put it on again , Molly and I regarding it with fixed smiles and protracted study , as though our attention were hopelessly imprisoned there , or would be so unless someone had the strength to change the subject . I asked how the production was coming , and Todarescufrowned . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some of the smaller parishes out of town , " he said . " Bridgeportand maybe Darien . " We were drifting slowly toward the Jaguar . Todarescu revealed an interest in the classics . " I 'd like to try something fresh and exciting with Shakespeare , " he said as the two got into the car . " Why do n't you do him in Elizabethan dress ? " I said , thrusting my head into the tonneau . " That would be a new slant these days . " " Plim-plam-plom , " he said , switching on the motor and away they shot , their necks snapping . " Shakespeare in  --  oh , plim-plim-plam . Oh , that 's rich ! " I knew that I had to do something fast . What ? That night as I lay in bed I had a brainstorm . Hire Molly in the parish office . Why not ? We needed a full-time secretary there now , to supersede the part-time makeshifts with which we 'd been worrying along . Molly had had some secretarial schooling ( was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York ? ) and she had professed boredom with her city hall job . I phoned her there the very next day and proposed my scheme . She thought it a wonderful idea . She quit the following week and went to work immediately in my office . She broke into harness slowly , but I expected that . For a time , the arrangement entailed my retyping the bulk of the correspondence I had dictated ; her stenography was a bitp65rusty and had to be brushed up on . Meanwhile she was perfectly adequate for typing out my sermons ( which made accessible to her the contents of the many which only Tabitha Twitchet would otherwise have heard ) . The main thing was that we were now , at last , together . There was nobody else in the office . Inside track indeed ! Todarescu had her one or two nights a week , I five days . Thus , too , was devised that conjunction which my parishioners might now in all good humor assess as " He married his secretary . " With what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would be liked . To open the valves of this gossip there remained but the final step of getting Molly on some committee where she might show her interest in church affairs to be more than narrowly occupational and theatrical , and where I might be seen as having eyes for her in open society . By now I had been six months widowed , Turnbull had not been heard from , and neither had Hester been moved to any new commemoration of her sister . Things seemed to have quieted down on that front . The psychologicalmoment  --  the moment for my first public date with Molly Calico  --  seemed at hand . All the signs indicated that I could take her to the annual parish Harvest Supper . Fortunately it was late this year , having got shoved on from the Thanksgiving period into early December , and I prefaced my seizure of the moment by a period of walking around town with the lost air of a single man who really ought to find someone again . My chin sunk in a black overcoat , one blustery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of my congregation standing on a street corner , watching me . They were Mrs. Comstock , Mrs. CoolPainteyand vlrs . Sponsible , all fresh from the Wednesday meeting of the Ladies Auxiliary , where they had no doubtp66been discussing plans for this very supper . Trudging by on the other side of the street with my head lowered , I could well imagine their conversation . " I hate to see a man all by himself like that . " " So do I. He ought to remarry . " " That 's what I say . I was telling Gerald last night , Ida May would n't want to see him this way ... " Other groundwork was laid in the case of Tabitha Twitchet . Molly had me home to dinner , and I did my best to win her mother over , on the principle that , having her blessing , you could n't possibly have any man 's disapproval . She had not only joined the church but had quite blitzed the Ladies Aid , to which she had got herself elected treasurerin a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Old Yankee element with which FairfieldCounty is , for all its sophistication , still heavily seamed . My cause could have no finer emissary there . They cottoned to Mrs. Calico all right , and I was at conversational pains to have her do the same to me  --  with Molly as an eager interlocutor . " Tell Mother about the boy who wanted to put a Santa Claus in the Christmas creche , " she said after dinner one evening . " Do , do , do , " Mrs. Calico said , wriggling with pleasure over her knitting . " Well , that 's all there 's to it really , " I said . " There was this boy who wanted to put a Santa Claus in among the Wise Men . I objected at first , but later relented . " " They can be so cute . When Molly was a little girl she used to think Noel was Oh well . ' We 'd go caroling and there 'd be this one singing away at the top of her voice : Oh well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Born is the King of Israel . ' "  |p67I  felt the conversation to be sliding rapidly downhill . However , I added to it , " When I was a boy , I used to pray , Hallowell be thy name . ' " We laughed at this a bit , and then Molly said , " I 'll make us some coffee . You stay where you are , Mother , and get acquainted with Andrew . " " Andrew , ' is it ? " said Mrs. Calico , casting up her eyes and pursing her lips in a manner that , perhaps together with the bowl of nuts she kept urging about , revived for me more vividly than ever the impression that she was Goody Tiptoes the squirrel wife , who would keep us warm all winter . " How shall I entertain a man like him ? " " Tell him about your faux pas with the bridge game . This was in like 1925 , before I was born even , but it 's still good , " said Molly from very nearly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calico and I were alone . Mrs. Calico smiled in preparation for her story . " It 's just that people rather fancy me a matchmaker , " she began . " Well , anyway , I had these two spotted as made for one another . She was a lovely young lady , tall and elegant in the old-fashioned manner , and dressed for it too . This was when women 's styles still had grace and beauty , before they went to pot under Coolidge . Well , so I got them together for an evening of bridge here  --  I was a newlywed at the time myself  --  and when they were introduced they said , Oh , I 'm sorry . We 've already been married . ' It turned out the beasts had been divorced a few years before . " She straightened a row of stitches on her knitting needle . " Showing , you see , that I was right in my hunch about them . That they were meant for each other . " There was silence , broken only by the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut in her teeth.  | " Negro toe ? " she said , thrusting at me a bowl dominated by salted Brazil nuts . " No , thanks , " I said . " You like my Molly ? " " Very much indeed . " " She 's a prince . A prince of a girl , and there are n't many of those around . " " No , that is certainly right . " " Balls . " Mrs. Calico tugged crossly at her yarn , with which the cat was apparently again rollicking . " That 's all she wants to play with all the livelong day is balls . Fatima , go away . Scratch the rug , claw Reverend Flounder to bits , but do leave my yarn alone . " She retrieved the ball of wool from the floor and set it on her lap . The cat wandered off , and as though acting on the second of the alternatives posed it , sprang into my lap and began to shred the knee of my trousers . " Well , when she gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Calico said . " Four is enough . I keep telling her , my dear girl , it 's now time to settle down . Roots ! " Molly returned from the kitchen where she had set the coffee to brewing . ' We chatted till it was presumably ready , and then Mrs. Calico rose and went to fetch it . I had again the conviction , this time almost overpowering , that I was four-footed and would spring down from the chair and follow her into the kitchen . There we would sit and talk of Mrs. Raccoon , who took in washing , and what Freddy Frog had said and how the Otters had behaved at Mrs. Woodchuck'sparty . We would drink our tea while the sun came in the window or the rain pattered on the roof , and no harm would ever find us there . I said to Molly , touching the tip of the cat 's ear , " You were married all those times . You did n't tell me that . "  | " I thought you would n't like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed the tassels down . " I thought you 'd like it better if they were just passing fancies ? Not so checkered ? I tried , Andy , I really did . It was n't my fault . Some people just have this fatal attraction to the wrong mates . I just want that to end . I want it to stick . " There were tears in her eyes . " I do love you . " " Have you been seeing Todarescu ? " " Todarescu 's awful . Still he 's rather nice . " " You really thought I 'd think you more , well , sullied that way than this ? If they were actual marriages ? " She nodded . " You 're a bijou , " I said . " You 're no bargain yourself . " The cat jumped out of my lap as I shifted toward her , and she dropped the pillow . We were on the sofa . She yielded her face up to be kissed . I felt her tears on my cheeks , and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll take you to the Harvest Supper , " I said , huskily . " You do n't think that 's pushing it ? " " I 've got to have you . We ca n't go on tearing one another to shreds . " Her warmth and her scent sickened me . I pressed her back against the sofa , and she drew my head down till we were lying length to length . My hand reached to touch her and she drew back with a sound that was both like a sob and a gasp of laughter , as though a bubble of hysteria had burst within her . " You wo n't think it 's the other way around , will you ? That I was lying to Mother that they were marriages ? " " I never thought of that , " I said , ill . " So that 's the way it was . " There was a tinkle of china as the wheels of the teacart bounced over the edge of the rug and into the room.  | " The family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have relatives arriving ? " I said , almost falling to the floor in the act of rolling back off the couch . " No , as an institution . I just heard it on the radio . The divorce rate is going steadily down . The figures for this year are considerably below last . " " Statistics show a marked decline , " I said , my voice hoarse with passion . I tidied myself while Mrs. Calico stood pouring coffee with her back to us . There was a great shaggy coconut cake , which looked delicious . Molly sat with her legs tucked under her , screwing on an earring . " Let 's make one thing clear , " Mrs. Calico said , her back turned to us as she sliced the cake . " When we speak of puttingdown roots we do n't mean sticking in the mud . The home will never be the rigid thing it perhaps once was , but it is reviving , and I 'm glad to see that because I witnessed its deterioration . I can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go under Woodrow Wilson , the so-called idealist . Well , a good deal of world vision there , to be sure , but a thoroughly miserable administration on domestic counts . . . " Thus everything appeared to be shaping up . Everything seemed to be moving toward that psychological moment , for which I would time that quick dash to the altar for which I pined . And then the unforseen happened . Cat hairs were seen on my coat . Hester slipped across the arcade between the rectory and the church office , one bright , gusty morning , to consult with me about some household detail . We had to discuss the seating arrangement for a luncheon I was giving thep71supper committee ladies . When we had finished our talk , she jerked her head toward the closed door beyond which Molly 's spasmodic typing could be heard in the outer office . " Quite a looker , " she said . " The new member who called you that morning , I believe . Incidentally , now that we 've got somebody full-time in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clerk stuff , " I said . " Why , yes , she is quite pretty . And so interested in the church , Hester . Probably be a ball of fire on the right committee . You might mention that to your ladies . Need help on the Harvest Supper arrangements , do n't you ? " Hester 's reply , though an affirmative " I will , " was rather abstracted . She was coming around behind the desk , staring at my coatsleeve . " Do n't tell me I have n't been brushing your clothes any better than this , Andrew . " She began to pluck strands of a light yellow color from it and to drop them to the floor with fluttering fingers . " Hm , " I observed , picking off a few myself . " Seem to be cat hairs . " " Not just ordinary cat hairs . More like Siamese or something . Who 's got one of those ? " " Oh , I do n't remember . I make so many calls . People have them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassed breath , and turned back to my loaded desk . " Do you know that I made sixteen calls last week ? Sixteen . Well , I believe I told Mrs. Comstock and her ladies twelve-thirty . " Hester slipped out , closing the door quietly behind her . I drew a dictaphone toward me and resumed reading my next Sunday 's sermon into its mouthpiece . I was delivering a series on historical American legends , in which I showed how in deifying national figures we often draw them out of their human focus , to our loss . The new one was on Betsyp72Ross , whom I praised as possessing that large vision that enables man to rise above individual mischance . " The seamstress lost her husband in the war of the Revolution , but she continued his upholstery business and married again in 1777  --  the following year , " I read into the dictaphone from notes . " Betsy 's second husband , Joseph Ashbourn , died in 1783 in an English prison , but did she despair ? No ! Again she remarried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We could all learn a lesson from herI paused , hearing women 's voices raised in conversation in the outer office . I rolled the dictaphone away and stole over to the closed door . I put my ear to the crack and listened . " It takes a while , but I 'm getting onto the ropes , " Molly was saying . " Of course it takes a while , " Hester chatted . " Beautiful skirt . " " Oh , do you like it ? Thank you . I was n't sure about the color . " " It 's nice . I like that oatmeal weave . " I squatted down on my heels to peer through the keyhole . I got my eye to it in time to see Hester , who had been standing beside Molly 's desk , come over and finger the material she was admiring . " Tweed is n't the most flattering thing in the world , but it 's practical , " Molly said . " It does n't show everything . " " Somebody 's got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of my coats look like fur coats . You ca n't sit down anywhere in the house without picking it up . " " Siamese ? " " Mm , " Molly nodded . I rose and turned to my desk . I picked up my typewriterp73hood from it and hurled it across the room with all my might . I was not surprised to hear what I heard at breakfast three mornings later . Hester gazed out the window as she ate . " The air is like wine , " she said at last . " How do you know ? " I said . " I 've been out to burn that box of trash you 've left on the porch since last Saturday . But it was too windy . " " I 'm sorry . I 'll get to it today sometime . " I got behind the Avalon Globe . Turnbull was in the news this morning . There was a series of articles running entitled " Topsy Town , " which outlined the agonies of local merchants in finding sites on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made possible by the city 's swellingpopulation . There was no hope of obtaining such acreage to " improve " in the heart of town unless Turnbull was willingto sell a large tract he owned along the river . He refused . I admired his stubborn protection of the land in question , but the businessmen were up in arms . The Chamber of Commerce was at its wit 's end . Things were said to be in a state of crisis . " All the trade , " the mayor wailed , " is going to Chickenfoot . " I set the paper aside and attacked my grapefruit with a will . " I 'm rather looking forward to the Harvest Supper , " I said . " Talk of a dance along with it this year . Excellent idea . " " And so appropriate . " " How do you mean ? " " It 's the way she 'd have wanted it . Ida May . " I wedged a grapefruit pip from between my teeth and laid it on my dish.  | " What 's she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , have n't you heard ? This year 's affair is to be in her honor . " I finished the grapefruit and picked up my coffee . I held it in my two hands , regarding Hester over its rim as I blew on it . " Oh , Andrew , do n't look at me like that . I know how you hate speeches but  --  " " Speeches ! " " Yes . It 's to be a testimonial banquet , is what we thought we 'd have , but the tributes are being limited to five minutes , and when you 're called on you do n't have to say more than a few words . It 's just five years since she began her fund-raising drive for the clinic , and this seemed like a natural way to commemorate it . And then off to the ball ! " My impulse when I had raised my napkin was to slam it down , but I checked myself with an effort , and made as if to be flicking crumbs energetically from my person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hester said . " We were always alike in that respect . " I was digesting the implication of this turn of events , particularly as to its bearing on my own plans for the evening in question . They would have to be canceled , of course . You could n't take a prospective second wife to a do in honor of your first . " Hester , are you behind this ? " I demanded . " Well , the women all thought  --  " " Oh , the women ! Do you have a date for it ? " " Not as yet , " she said , lowering her eyes . " Not as yet , " I repeated , as though to emphasize both her sexual isolation and the conversational style to which it was leading . " Why have n't you , if you 're so fond of dancing ? Why have n't you ever , if it comes to that ? Hester , you 've gotp75to come out of your shell  --  be a woman . Live your own natural life . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you wake up some morning and find you 're like fifty-five , and it 's too late ? Why not start now ? Why do n't you go out with men ? Do you know what I 've heard said about you ? I did n't intend to go this far but it 's for your own good that I do . Remember that in these days gossip is often inverted , and people tend to suspect virtue as they once did its opposite . Especially in women , " I added ominously . " I 'll take that risk , " said Hester of the parted hair , not turning or raising her eyes . " What do they say about me ? " " That you 're a prude . I actually heard someone say that , my dear . " " And what did you say ? " " I said : He that is without sin among you , let him cast the first stone . ' " " That was very nice of you , Andrew . " Hester rose and walked with her characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you very much . I 'm glad to know I have someone defending me . A little like having a knight , al-most . " When I got to the office Molly greeted me with , " You 're late . The printer phoned twice already this morning . He wants to know the text for Sunday 's sermon . The bulletin 's all ready except for that . What 's the matter with you ? " " Molly , I 'm afraid the date 's off , " I said . I explained what was afoot . She reached for a cigarette she had smoking in an ashtray on her desk , drew on it and twisted it out . " So it 's Chickenfoot for us again . "  | " We still have this office , " I said grimly . " I was hoping I could quit work and get married . " " Oh , my dearest . " She rose and walked slowly to the window . She stood looking out , nursing her elbows . The spirals of gold at the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and wrapped my arms around her from behind . I cupped her breasts in my hands , the breasts I had never felt naked . I stroked their full tops with my two thumbs . I smothered her shoulders in kisses till I had to gasp for breath . " Here comes the paper towel man , " she said , drawing away . It was about ten minutes later that the phone rang and she answered it . " It 's the printer again , " she said , holding her hand over the transmitter . " Have you got your text yet ? " " Yes . " " What is it ? " " How long , 0 Lord , how long ? ' "  |p77DEARLY  beloved , " I said , my lips close to the mouth of the dictaphone and speaking eagerly , as I would when actually delivering my message at morning worship , " the Bible is at worst a hodgepodge of myths , superstitions and theologies so repugnant to a man of taste and sensibility , let alone a true Christian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest miracle we know . " I continued for some minutes , and then paused to play back what I had done . From beyond the closed door could be heard the soft , steady clatter of Mrs. Calico running off something for the Ladies Auxiliary on the mimeograph machine . When she finished with that , perhaps she would help out with a little of the office work . Molly had a cold and was staying in bed . It was highly doubtful that she would be in today , or the next day , or even perhaps the next . She would go see Doc Chaucer at the clinic , free , as all church employeesmight , and he would tell her ( and let him ) that her cold was psychosomatic . He was one of those doctors who run their practice on the firm theory that ninety-nine per cent of their patients are quacks . It was also highly doubtful , meanwhile , that Mrs. Calico could help out much in the way of actual stenography , which meant that I would nowp78be retyping the sermons that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . This was one of those sermons of which a good chunk could go into a book I was slowly and surely , over the years , getting together . Maturity Comes of Age was a study of the myths in which all human systems are steeped , and a plea for their adult recognition as such , a recognition which need in no wise diminish their psychological value for the individual or their potency as a source of order for society . Indeed , the more void the universe may be of meaning , the more precious the lanterns by which man picks his little way through it . As to the book itself , the more work I had to do on it the better ; let it ripen slowly , with its author . I was personally quite excited about it . Knopf had expressed interest , without even having seen any of the manuscript . I rose after an hour 's work and knocked off for a breather . I walked around my office , rubbing my fists into my back , which was sore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , where I stood a moment gazing out . The Jesus Saves sign was gone . My own part in the protestshad been unnecessary . The Episcopalians , who had shuddered , and the more influential Presbyterians  --  the more desirable element generally in Mobile Bay  --  had between them pulled enough weight to have the eyesore removed . Now , looking through the gap left among the trees where it had stood , I felt a pang of regret for old Turnbull . I liked him more than I 'd known . I liked him better the more he got in my hair , it seemed . But it was no use trying to explain to him that this sort of thing gave the church a bad name . What about Stevie ? It was one of those instances of mental telepathy . As I tumed back , the phone rang , and it was Turnbull . His voice sounded pleased . In fact , ecstatic.  | " Guess what , " he said . " Stevie 's coming home for the holidays , and guess what . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He seems anxious to have me meet her right away , so I do n't know . He may even have her in trouble . " " I 'm so happy for you . " " Yes ... Well , with that off my mind I 've been able to think about the memorial , and I think I 've come up with something . I do n't want to tell you over the phone , but I have a hunch you 'll like it . Of course the problem has been to hit on something appropriate . " " Always remembering her dislike of monuments as such . For her , life was the thing , and must go on . Forget me , ' she often said . I do n't count . ' " " Right . So something big , that will take the public 's fancy and keep her alive among us for a long time to come . I 'd like to talk this over with you privately . Can you have lunch with me tomorrow at my club ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve-thirty then , at the Stilton ? " " Twelve-thirty will be fine . And as you say , do n't breathe a word of this till you 've talked to me , " I said . " Mrs. Mackerelwas a woman of very strong opinions , and who is in a better position to know that than I ? " The Stilton 's being one of the few clubs in the suburbs does not mean it was suburban . It was metropolitan in the old-fashioned sense , with mostly old men comprising its roster . Such an air of antiquity pervaded the club , which was housed in a pleasantly decaying graystone , that even its younger members , partly in the general wish to belong , partly in an unwitting adoption of its mood , affected thep80stance and gait of senility and scuffled about as though they were old men too . Chaps of thirty-five and forty , wearing Ivy League suits and button-down shirts , were seen pottering from chair to chair with newspapers in their hands or shuffling into the dining room beside their sponsors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after yielding my wraps to a mummy at the door named Luke , availed myself of a copy of the New York Times from an assortment on the lobby table and made in a bent fashionfor one of the chairs , where , instead of reading it , I sat awaiting my host . Everything was dead as a doornail . Several relics occupiedmates to the leather chair into which I had sunk . Most of them dozed , but one or two slumped behind open periodicals . Occasionally a withered hand crept from behind a newspaper to reach for a glass of sherry . From behind one paper issued a continuous throat-clearing which identified Joseph Meesum , dean of the club , a man of epic riches obtainedby selling parcel by parcel a thousand acres of inheritedland . Rival genealogical societies , independently retainedfor speed and certainty , had traced his ancestry to conflicting sources  --  Geoffrey of Anjou and feudal Holland  --  andhe had never been the same since . His sixtytwo-year-oldson Arthur was mayor of Avalon , and part of the club 's new blood . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wondered who belonged to them . I noticed on the table copies of the Manchester Guardian , New Statesman , and Punch , and missed the pair of members for whom these were regularly taken . They were the Arbuckle cousins , two Anglophiles who read only Britishperiodicals , ate only British sherry biscuits , and concernedthemselves solely with British politics . No Americanp81political campaign ever drew more than moderate interest from them , but they argued heatedly over forthcoming Britishelections . My last visit here had been at the time of the crisis resulting from Eden 's resignation as prime minister , and I remembered the intensity with which they had sat in their corner debating the relative merits of his possible successors . Needless to say the Arbuckle cousins came of the best old New England family stock hereabouts and were regardedwith special awe as an exclusive little group of their own at the Stilton , whose members would never dream of addressing either of them unless first spoken to . I rarely drank in those days , but I signaled to a waiter wearing carpet slippers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm waiting for Mr. Turnbull , " I said . " Could you bring me a Manhattan , please ? Dry . " The paper above the Argyll socks came down and a grinningface appeared . " Andrew Mackerel ! " " Charlie Comstock , " I said , recognizing one of my parishioners . His greeting had made a sleeper sit bolt upright and comment angrily on the disturbance . Another head came into view from behind the wings of a chair , and its owner glared at us with a Harvard accent . " Come on over , " I said , patting a chair near mine . " I do n't see you except in church . " " You see me there all right . " Comstock came over , carrying a glass of tomato juice . " But I miss you at the mid-week Bible study group . Why have n't I seen you there lately , An-drew ? " I murmured some apology about being busy , and promised to try to be more faithful in attendance in future . I was fond of Charlie , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope with , piety . I tried to understandp82the experience that had laid its hand on Charlie , and to beat with him in that light . Charlie Comstock was a reformed alcoholic . While not having touched a drop in eight years , he nevertheless retainedthe manner and attitude of the drunk . In fact , a casual observer not familiar with him would have thought he was stewed to the gills as he rose and wobbled over to join me . He slung his arm around me as though we were tavern cronies , and spoke in the slurred accents which his speech had never lost . He habitually ran his tongue from one corner of his mouth to the other , and his eyelids hung in a perpetual smiling good will . In the mounting excitement of parties , his foot always kept feeling for something , and eventually would come to rest on a chair rung . Holding a Coke , he made any group of men appear to be about to burst into the strains of " Sweet Adeline . " The marks of past indulgence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wind , an illusion no doubt valuable to Comstock . In his drinking days he had been literally picked up out of the gutter , and there were those who thought he might very well be again out of sheer autosuggestion . From behind , he seemed to walk down the street with an unsteady , even staggering gait . Religion had straightened him out , as it has many another drinker , but more than merely salvation-tipsy , he was a practical egg whose business head was an asset to any church or community project . He was copublisherof the local Globe , for which he also wrote . Needless to say he struck a divergent note in the Stilton . " Been enjoying your articles on the state of our fair city , " I said . " Oh , thanks . State is right . Hope Meesum does n't get ap ' - plexy when he shees old Turnbull walk in here . Tumbull 's villain piece . Downtown boys certainly making it hot forp83him . Ah , speak of the devil . " Comstock rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newcomer . " Glad see you , you old coot . " Comstock remained for the exchange of greetings , then withdrew to buttonhole Meesum , with a view to picking his brains for an article about our " Topsy Town . " I saw Meesum , whose paper had at last come down , shoot a glare at my host . Meesum was honorary chairman of the Chamberof Commerce . Turnbull ordered a highball for himself and another Manhattan for me , though my first had no more than arrived . He set fire to a long cigar and settled back in his chair . I saw it would be a while before he came to the point for which we were supposedly meeting . Turnbull was quite himself again . " I 've been prey to such remorse I can hardly sleep , " he said . " Oh , wicked man that I am , who shall deliver me from so great guilt ? Have I ever told you about the dancer in Biarritz ? " " No , I do n't believe I 've heard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned all night thinking of her . " " I know that feeling . " " It 's something you ca n't escape from . You carry it insideof you  --  here . If I take the wings of the morning and fly to the uttermost parts of the earth , he is there and his eye shall find me . If I make my bed in Sheol , lo , he is there . What a worm am I. " " Does n't it ever seem to you that you 're rather giving yourself airs ? " I said , as I had before . It is a pet notion of mine that certain theological systems ( like Calvinism ) are inversions of the humility they profess , since they appeal to human vanity rather than deflateit . Poor man , that he needs the doctrine of the Fall top84invest him with a little glamour ! Pitiful ego , that must sit in sackcloth and ashes and fancy itself the butt of Reprobaion ! Unvexed , however , by either my remark or its broader implications , Turnbull went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so great that it would take another lifetime to expiate them . What haunts me is not the dancer as such , but the impact I made on her whole future . She had been engaged , you see , " he continued after a swallow of his highball , " she had been engaged , as I understood it , to a Brussels businessman . Security he could give her , yes , but not , I 'm afraid , somethingelse demanded by her Lebenslust . You understand German ? " " Enough to get the point . Go on . " " Well , I was sitting on the beach at Biarritz one afternoon , " he related , settling fluently into the raconteur , " when out of the water rose this . . . " He expounded in detailthe scraping up of acquaintance and the episodes to which it led , listing among his " shortcomings " the number of times he had satisfied his companion in one night . Here I felt a twist of irritation , enforced no doubt by the months of abstention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to tell on my nerves . " Are you quite sure of your figures ? " I asked tartly . " It 's a sin to tell a lie , you know . " Turnbull assured me of the accuracy of his audit , and hit his narrative stride with brightening eye . The details of this " confession , " more lurid than any before , drew only rudimentaryattention from me , who had become fascinated with the rather interesting problem in casuistry it posed : that of a penitent asking to be shriven of transgressions he had not committed , at least not in the degree claimed . PerhapsI was myself in error in giving the man his head ? But Ip85had decided it would be pointless to commence to Turnbullexhaustive analysis of what lay behind his bouts of contrition . That I knew very little of his complexities was suddenly driven home to me with a remark for which I was totally unprepared . " What I owe womankind in general is nothing compared to what I owe your wife , of course , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about . " What do you mean ? " I asked . " You know what I mean . " He looked away to pick up his glass . " What happened that day at the cove . " I still had n't the foggiest idea what he was referring to , though the day of which he was speaking was clear enough , being the one on which my wife had met with her fatal mishap . The scene had been the annual parish picnic at DiamondCove , on the nearby sound . It had been a warm summerday and both bathers and boaters had been disporting themselves in large numbers when a fluke occurrence had thrown the entire seaside into a hilarious uproar . A man in a motorboat had been towing his girl on a surfboard some distance out . She had toppled off and the man had stopped the boat and dived in after her  --  not because there was an emergency , since she could swim , but more or less in the spirit of fun . The push of his feet leaving the gunwale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in neutralwith the engine running , back into gear . Without a driver the speedboat had gone winding crazily about the harbor , sending bathers screaming with laughter in every direction . Not all were aware of what was loose in the cove , however , and one of these was Turnbull , afloat on an inner tube with a cigar in his mouth . He reported later that he had dozed off in the summer sun , and that in any case hisp86ears had not caught any sound above the shrill cries that are a common part of bathing beach life . The speedboatseemed finally to be spinning straight for him , but , the warning shouts unheard , he bobbed along obliviousto what was in store for him . Or , rather , for Mrs. Mackerel . We had been out in a canoe among the boaters , nibblingsandwiches from a hamper and playing records as best we could on a portable gramophone . Seeing what was amiss , my wife had instinctively stood up and begun to shout and gesticulate with the rest , capsizing the canoe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Overturningparaphernalia , undoubtedly the gramophone , had dealt the fatal blow to which death was traced as much as to drowning . No one noticed that mishap until it was too late , indeed , until it was all over  --  not even I who jumped into the water as the boat tipped , or a split instant before , to help catch the speedboat . In the excitement I was not even aware that the canoe had tipped . A lifeguard and I stopped the motorboat , by managing to catch hold of her gunwales and turning off the ignition . It was this accident the old fool was now bent on rehashing . I racked my brains for some clue as to why . Suddenly he was explicit . " She was trying to go to my rescue , was n't she ? " he said . I looked at him blankly  --  unwilling as well as unable to believe my senses . " What ? " I said . " It 's no use . You 're just denying it to spare my feelings . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracyof silence . It 's so kind of you . But it all came to me in a flash last night as I was lying in bed . She jumped . " " She fell , " I said firmly.  | " She jumped . " " She fell . " " She jumped . " " Fell . " " Jumped . " The absurd crescendo of this argument brought looks from others in the lobby , and even from the adjacent dining room where members had begun eating , and we lowered our voices . " But , my dear Turnbull , " I resumed none the less earnestly , " this is the most  --  You must n't punish yourself with such a thing ... " It was no use  --  that much of what he said was right . All my attempts to dissuade him from this mad construction of events were futile . My sensation was like that of careening wildly down a twisting road in a car that has gone out of control . Reminders that it was rather I who had gone into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may I say in my favor , but I did my best to show why my wife could not have , all to no avail . Just what form such aid could have taken in the case of so negligible a swimmer as Ida May did not long detain Turnbull , who could adduce too many instances of the instinctive heroism of women in emergencies , and had apparently no trouble seeing himself as the object of this supreme concern . That was the point  --  he wanted to believe this . I sensed the pattern in all of it : wallowing in claims of women ruined had the same narcissisticroot as the delusion that one could give her life for him . " That woman will have a memorial the like of which this town has never seen , " he promised , bringing us back , at last , to the reason why we had supposedly come here . " Now , then , " I said , " what did you decide on ? "  |p88Turnbull  dropped his half-smoked cigar in an ashtray and drank up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " What I thought of was a fund in her name to train missionaries for service in heathen lands , but that would involvetoo many problems of what kind of training they would have and so on . It 's got to be more interdenominational . " He glanced into the dining room . " It 's filling up and you must be starved . I 'll tell you in there . " Club protocol required that each newcomer take the chair beside the last man seated at the long communal table that ran the Iength of the dining room . This landed me betweenold Meesum and Turnbull . On Meesum 's other side , his left , was Charlie Comstock , scribbling madly on a notepadas Meesum held forth on the subject of the local Crisis . It is to this chance juxtaposition that I owe the whole course of my present life . Here were the seeds of that calamitythat was so soon and so speedily to engulf me , whose origins and development were obscure to me at the time , but which , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assess in all clarity . " Why , I was thinking of a fountain , " Turnbull said as we drew out chairs . " The idea is that her spirit flows on among us . " I murmured some acknowledgment that this was certainly nonsectarian , but before I could say more , Meesum pricked up his ears , paused in his diatribe , looked over at its subject and growled , " Hello , Turnbull . What 's that about a fountain ? " " Nothing . " " Where , a fountain ? Where would you find the ground for such a thing ? " Meesum went on with needling irony . " None of your beeswax , " Turnbull said , and bowed his head in prayer . I joined him in grace , rather against my will , and awarep89that all sounds of conversation and even eating had ceased . Turnbull seemed an unconscionable time at his devotions , but when he did raise his head the pent-up cariosity broke out in an excited buzz . " What kind of a fountain ? When ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Junior , inquired eagerly across the table and two places down from me . When Turnbull answered reluctantly , " Memorial , " Junior asked , " Who for ? " Turnbull jerked his head in my direction . " His wife . " In the respectful pause which followed that , and which was marked by a solemn regard of myself , he added , " She lost her life because of me , and I 've always wanted to give something to perpetuate her name . " Here the city fathers raised their ears as one . " Give ' ? " said the mayor as their spokesman . " Why , that 's wonderful . And you know we 'll co-operate to the full . But where would you put it ? As Dad here says , where 's there room for the settingsuch a treasure deserves ? " Turnbull straightened in his chair . " You know damn well I 've got all the land I need for it myself , Junior . " During this silence the elder Meesum elected to drink his soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hydraulic problem of its transfer to his mouth grated on some of his listeners . He put his spoon down and looked past me straight at Turnbull . " Frank , I 've been saying a lot of things about you . I 've called you a string saver and a skinflint and I do n't know what all . Such names I now find it hard to forgive you for inciting me to . Why did n't you tell me you were O.K. ? If I 've been abusive it 's because I thought you lacked the civic spirit that 's the only thing that 'll keep this city from withering into a ghost town , which it will do if we don'tp90do something fast to keep the trade from going to Gilead and Chickenfoot . In short , I thought you were an obstructionist . " As he spoke he made faces that had no bearing on what he was saying but that were technically exciting in themselves . " Now it turns out that you would n't sell your land because all the while you were planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up that whole waterfront in a dazzling and daring new conception of Avalon . " " I do n't believe I  --  " " Forgive me . I thought it was just that you were holding out for a price . But I guess you can read the papers as well as any of us . You know juvenile delinquency is spreading because children have no room to play . That congestion is the great evil of our time and the crying need . So you come along with this breathtaking vision for our town : twenty acres from your land augmented maybe by filling in the river there some , and presto  --  overnight elbow room ! Congestionrelieved ! Children playing in the sun ! Shoppers pouringinto the twenty , make it thirty , new stores springing up there , with a theme uniting them all architecturally . " He paused to wipe the corners of his mouth with his napkin , as though in his ecstasy he had begun to salivate . An architectat the end of the table began to writhe erotically in his chair , ogling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with ample parking space . The greatest modern shoppingcenter in the state . Not just one street front exposure but a double avenue  --  I know you 're way ahead of me  --  along the river front there , with a green esplanade between . And that fountain sparkling in it day and night . " If this was sly  --  and it could hardly have been sincere becauseMeesum was a skinflint himself  --  it had its effect . Turnbull stopped protesting the assumption of limitless donation and became infected with the vision . Someonep91whispered " Turnbull Avenue , " but he shook his head . He sat transfixed , looking over the assembled heads . He was witnessingan apocalypse . Someone said later that a tear coursed down his cheek . As if out of a trance he whispered , " The Mackerel Plaza . " They gazed at one another with a wild surmise . Then a hubbub broke out such as had not been heard in the Stiltonsince its founder had died in his sleep in a sitting positionand that swelled in volume as the vision vouchsafed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fountain sprang into play for Chisholm , the architectdying to do a civic center . For Kerfoot , an electrical engineer , the lights bloomed each evening like voluminous pearls along the esplanade . The mayor was already cutting tape and leading motorcades on special days . Miles of featurecopy unreeled for Comstock , writing feverishly on a fresh pad . Cars were parked in neat herringbones for a bald man named Scanlon , who was seated at the head of the table and ran a paving concern . Old Meesum was floating loans for the bank with whose board of directors he could still sit up straight . " How soon can we get the property deeded over ? " the mayor asked . " I 'll search the title this afternoon , " said Sprackling , an up-and-coming partner in the oldest law firm in town . " What Frank will want to decide is what land he wants to give to the city for the esplanade and fountain , and what he 'll sell to those who want in on the shopping center . Those , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Plaza will consist . " After ten minutes more of this , somebody broke in with a thought . " We have n't heard from Mr. Mackerel about this . Doesp92he have anything to say ? Perhaps we could call on him for a few words at this time . " The hum of conversation died . All eyes were turned on Mackerel . He was drawing deep grooves on the tablecloth with the tines of his fork . " Well , my wife was a simple woman , " he reminded them . He smiled reminiscently . " Her favorite expression was , No fuss , please . ' " " We 'll put it on the fountain , " the mayor said . " It ought to have an inscription . Now , what else should we bear in mind , thematically speaking ? Some little touch , an angle that might be stressed and that we ought to include in our thinking before we get rolling , which will be right now and full speed ahead , of course . Dad , did you have a thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about mental health . " " And that is of course already her enduring monument  --  the clinic . " This from Mackerel in a loud voice . " Right . That 's why I was thinking some other inscriptionthan the one proposed might be better , with all due respectsto the Reverend , " Sprackling put in . " What aboutSans mens sans corpora . ' ? " " That 's all Greek to inc . " Old Meesum had lit a cigar the length of a scepter , which he tended to flourish as such . " I 'm a practical man and I say let 's ring in the Chamber of Commerce this afternoon . With them in the picture we can coordinate and move intelligently on all fronts . If we have n't gotten much out of our friend Mackerel here , let 's remember he 's in mourning and will probably be for some time to come . The loss of Ida May is ours as well as his , and that no woman can ever , ever take her place is something we join him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tangible form what is enshrined in his heart . So let 's bucklep93down and , forgetting everything but the proper celebration of this woman , all projects that would interfere with its proper and respectful pursuit , make this the fairest jewel in the diadem of our city . " There was a round of applause , and he glanced to the left to make sure Comstock was getting it all down . " Now if we get rolling right away , how long should it take ? " " I see Junior cutting that tape nine months from now , " said Kerfoot , a lickspittle in whose eyes slumbered a soft dream of contracts . " Well , give it a year . A year from now , the Ida May Mackerel Plaza will be a reality . " Mackerel was deep in lightning calculations . He saw a quarterly period of obsession at either end of the inevitable Ida May Day  --  when the Plaza would be dedicated , et cetera  --  but if that were n't till a year from now , he and Molly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could with grace wed ( this lull to be reckoned as beginning , of course , after the Testimonial Dinner now in the works was over and that hoopla had subsided in the public mind ) . He was glad now the dinner was imminent , as it would get the cooling-off period started that much sooner . He was entertaining the image of himself darting to the altar through this chink in time , so to speak , when the mayor dashed cold water on that . " Of course there 'll be a ground breaking ceremony . " " To kick it off . " " When do you figure that ? " Mackerel asked , raising his battered head . " Oh , early spring . " ( Damn ! ) " Why not this winter ? " said Mackerel , aiming at some overlapping in the encomiums.  | " Ground 's too cold . " Mackerel sat back with the expression natural to a man bereft . He said no more for the duration of that lunch , but kept his own counsel . He had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his silence for more than private feelings on the score of the project now so well launched , and for more than modesty in reflected glory ; they took it as a sign of the greatest respect for the Stilton . And on their part they hinted that he might before long find himself enjoying the full member privileges of same . One or two murmuredthat they might personally put him up . Mackerel , who had till then patterned his bearing on that of his hosts by dragging his feet and walking with a stoop , threw his shoulders back and strode out of that club at a rate calculatedto put an end to any such nonsense . He sailed similarly through the door into Molly 's house early the next evening , after phoning to say that he had something urgent to tell her.  |p95MOLLY  was home alone . After letting me in she ran back to the kitchen where she had some beef tea on the stove . She drank it as we sat in the living room together . She really did have a cold . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belted tight and drawn up around her breasts . Thus did the fruit sway out of reach of Tantalus , his head bobbing on the stream ' neath the cruel branch withheld . " You say you had lunch at the Stilton Club ? " she asked in surprise . " You do n't think I should eat with Republicans and sin-ners ? " " Darling , what 's the matter ? You do n't act right . " " How 's Todarescu these days ? " I said . " Oh , all right I guess . He has this terrible Weltschmerz . " " Is he taking anything for it ? " " Look , what 's it all about ? You intimated you had something to tell me , and I gathered it was n't too good . What is it ? " I blurted out my news , giving a full account of every developmentat lunch . She finished sipping her beef tea in silence . When she hadp96tipped the last of it back , she set the cup and saucer aside and rose . She walked across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table in passing . " Well , " she said , " I must say , your wife casts a long shadow . " " Steady . " " How long will we have to lay low now ? " " I warned you about that from the start , darling . Of course I was n't prepared for anything on this scale . What we must do is develop a certain detachment within our ring of secrecy  --  loving , offhand , yet antiseptic withal . A kind of dolce far niente behind drawn blinds . That appeal to you , sweetheart ? " " There 's a kind of mockery in it , " she went on . " As though someone 's having a laugh on us . As though she 's reaching out from the  --  " " Whoa , there . I must insist you stop this , Molly , " I replied . " You said yourself she 'd be the first to understand . " " I did n't know her then . Now I feel I 'm beginning to . My problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another woman . " I hoisted myself to my feet , bringing my hands down on my knees . " I must say , what cheesy , wheezy neo-Noel Coward did you get that line from ? Pray favor me with the rest of the speech in that play that folded after three performances . Go on , I 'm waiting . " " A living rival you can fight . But this . " She nursed her elbows , shivering a little . " I seem to feel a draft ... " I sprang into action . " Watch , " I said . I drew an appointment booklet from my pocket , shuffled its pages and ringed a date with a pencil . " I told you we were going to set a date , and , by God , I meant it.  |p97Come  here , " I said , sitting down on the couch . She came over and stood behind me . " If the ground-breaking ceremony is then "  --  I poked the month of April with the butt of the pencil  --  " or about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that gives us a good four or five months when the coast will be clear to announce our engagement . And set the wedding date for  --  then . " I vigorously darkened the circle I had made on the calendar . It was in the very month of June . She nodded , not as though acquiescing but as though revolvingmy logic in her mind . She asked at last : " Did you figure on a church wedding ? " " No , I thought a quiet ceremony would be better . Steal away somewhere . I know a minister in Chickenfoot I went to seminary with . There 's no problem there . " She scratched an eyebrow , looking down at the memo book open on my knee . " Since we ca n't date openly till the ball is well over with , we 're going to have to crowd a lot of courtship in a short time , bud . They 'll no more than see us going together than we 'll have to spring the engagement on them . " " Call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , as though a tribal shibbolethhad worked its potent spell . Then I did something that actually did sweep her off her feet . Putting the memo book away I drew from another pocket a small black jeweler 's box , and released the catch . A diamond ring sprang into view . " Andy , " she said . She came quickly round the sofa and kissed me . I slipped the ring on her finger and her arms went round my shoulders and she melted into my embrace . Then she lay back with her head on my breast , gazing at the stone on her extended hand.  | " I do n't suppose I can wear it ? " she sighed regretfully . " The time will come . " Molly remembered a bottle of champagne someone had given her last Christmas and we chilled it . We kissed again , laughing about her cold which I would surely get , and sipped the wine and were happy for an hour . " We 'll bring it off , " I said , " when the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang and she went into the next room to answer it , carrying her glass and drawing away from one of my kisses with a giggle of pleasure . I turned the bottle in its ice during her absence , rolling the neck between my palms as they do in the movies ; I do n't know why this is done and perhaps the actors do n't either , but I did it , smiling to myself . I could hear Molly in the next room but could n't make out what she was saying . She came back without her glass . " Well , I 'm on a committee . " " Ah ! That ought to blitzkrieg them . What sort of committee , sweets ? " " Your wife . The Ida May Mackerel Memorial Committee , Women 's Church Auxiliary branch . We 're having our first meeting Tuesday . " I raised the wet champagne napkin , which I 'd been rearrangingaround the neck of the bottle , and smacked it down on the table . " That 's the last straw . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Comstock . She 's heading it . " " That downtown bunch certainly do n't let any grass grow under their feet ! So they 've asked the parish ladies to form a group to work along with the Chamber of Commerce . Well , we 're in it up to our ears now . " She plopped down on the sofa with her elbow on her kneep99and her chin in her hand , in the classic female attitude of disgust . " This was your bright idea . Me working on a committee . " " Not this committee ! " " I told you there was a hand reaching out from the Great Bey  --  " " Could n't you have said no ? " " After that build-up you 've been giving me ? I 'm the greatest little old fireball church worker ever seen in these parts , to hear you tell it . " " It was part of the plan . " She raised her head and seemed to look thoughtfully out . " Your plan , " she remarked slowly , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Maybe it 's a warning that we 're not compatible . I seem to be more religious than you . " " As evidenced by the frequency with which you attend church . " " Well , there are places that I do go . " She averted her gaze and said , " I 've been to Mrs. Balsam . Do you know her ? " I was genuinely aghast at this . " The theosophist ! " I said . " This is the limit . I know you theater people are superstitiousand go to clairvoyants and all , but I thought it was no more than that . A medium ! This is really too much . " " I 'm worried and confused , and , besides , what can you lose ? Nothing , while you have everything to gain . You quote Pascal that way to me about Christianity . Why does n't it applyto a seance ? " " Seance ! " " I thought if I could get in touch with her ... " She had risen and started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her around . " I 'll thank you to leave my wife out of this , " I said . " You give me the creeps . " " There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophies , " she said gently . " I know , Molly , I know . " I dropped my hands and turned away myself . " Why is it people never believe in the hand of God till they get the back of it ? " There was a silence , and then I saw that she had begun to cry . Or at any rate to tweak her nose with a wadded handkerchief . " Our first quarrel , " she said . I went to her and put my arms around her . I gave her a clean handkerchief to complete freshening herself with . " Now let 's get back to where we were . Let 's see , where were we ? Man proposes , woman accepts , as the fella said . Right , sweetie ? Now let 's pin up our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " It does occur to me to ask  --  I 'm only thinking out loud , remember  --  could n't you have said no ? " " Not gracefully . Andy , it would have left a bad taste in my mouth , " she said . " You know what I mean . It would have been a  --  well , a fly in the ointment of , well , of us ' forever after . I could n't look myself in the face again . " " And I love you the more for it . " " Oh , do n't start that again . " " But it just is n't fair to a man ! It 's like one long funeral service . No man should have that asked of him . " I circled the room , fetching up behind the sofa , on which she was again sitting . " It 's all such a senseless jumble . " " On the contrary I 'm beginning to see a definite pattern in the whole thing . Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm talking about a human one now . " She turned her head toward me but not enough to meet my eye , resting her arm along the back of the sofa . " Mrs. Comstock said she gotp101my name from Hester Pedlock , who told her I was high up on the list of eager beavers . Was it you who told Hester that ? " I held both fists in the air like a conductor leading an orchestra in a prolonged discord , at the same time gnashing my teeth . " We should have declared ourselves sooner , struck out boldly , let the chips fall where they may . Now it 's too late . She 's got us trapped . Boxed in . It 's this fixation I explained she has about her sister . It 's so deep she wo n't let me remarry . That 's the whole thing in a nutshell . " " Is it ? " Molly said , smoothing her bathrobe along her knee . " I 'll do something about her , but meanwhile here we are with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why should an early remarriage have to be justified anyway ? " I protested . " It may be a measure of the gulf that has to be filled . Of the very depth  --  " " Yes , yes , I know . You 've explained all that to me . " " In fact , I 'll go farther . I 'll say show me a man who does n't marry again and you 've given me a pretty good idea of what the first one was probably like . " " All right . Nobody 's judging you . Do n't let 's start all that again either . " We lapsed into another silence . After a moment I said , " I 'm thinking out loud again , but what about getting your mother to serve in your stead ? " " Do n't you see that would go against my grain too ? And besides , what good would it do ? We ca n't get married anywaywith all this going on in town , so I might as well be on the committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it piled on my desk anyhow , as usual . My God , that 's where I 'm going to be busy ! "  | " Have some more champagne . " I went into the other room for her glass . When I returned , it was to find her drawing the ring from her finger . " Better not let Mother see this . I mean it 's best not to take any chances with anybody . " She put it back in the box and the box in the pocket of her robe . I stood over her with the empty glass ; she stared at the floor . " Back to Chickenfoot , " she said . I set the glass on the table . I was myself as deliberate , as summarizingly direct , as she , but what I said transposed our relationship into a permanently new key . " But this time with a difference , " I said . " What do you mean ? " " Be lovers ? " She rose as if startled to her feet . I took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of Walter Pidgeon to rule out any implication of crassness . She turned her head away and said , " Golly ... " " It 's not our fault . We have n't wanted it this way . They 've driven us to it . They 've won . Outward sanctions are apparentlyto be denied us for the time being ; does that mean we should deny ourselves one another ? Hope deferred maketh the heart sick . ' " " At last I 've heard it . You 're quoting the Bible . " " The demands of taste we should and will meet  --  gladly  --  but society has no right to ask a man to behave like a medieval monk ! I love you , I yearn for you , I toss and turn for you , " I went on , stumbling blindly into rhyme . " Adulteryis just a word in a case like this . But if that 's what it 's called , let 's commit it ! " " You need n't preach . I do n't stand on ceremony any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted it to bep103right , and beautiful , " she said wistfully . " Besides , where would we go ? " " A hotel . " She gave a slight shudder , and the truth of ttie matter is I winced a little under the word myself . " I can just see myself slinking up to the desk with a tencentwedding band on my finger and a suitcase with housebricksin it . " " Housebricks ? " " Something I read in a novel once , " she explained quickly . " The lovers bought a cardboard suitcase and a ring at Woolworth 's , and on the way to the hotel passed a vacant lot where they stopped and put a few bricks in it . " " What happened then ? " " They were surprised in the room by the girl 's husband , who whipped out a pistol and pumped them both full of lead . But the idea of the housebricks , Andy , is so when the bellboy picks it up it wo n't feel empty ? Ugh ! Could I bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Would you rather I rented a small flat ? A little place to call our own , " I said , warming to it . " We could fix it up , have meals there  --  " " That scares me even more . A whole double life . Such a thing would kill Mother if it ever came to light . No , I suppose a hotel is the way . Maybe I could brazen it out . " " Of course you could . Too , there are hotels where that is n't necessary . They 're that type . " I had turned away and now stood at a table not facing her , where fidgeting of their own accord in an open box my fingers brought up a cigarette . Momentarily forgetting that I did n't smoke , I lit it and took a few nervous puffs . " Chickenfoot has them in quantities , in the very districtp104we 've been meeting in , " I said . " I mean we 've half come to it already . " " Like what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " The Coker ! Why , it 's notorious . " " That 's just it . Nobody we know would ever sec us there . " " But that 's all it 's ever used for . The Coker ! " " Would you rather a place where one of us might be recognizedin the lobby ? Do n't you see that 's why it 's right for us : the very fact that it 's just not our sort . " " But why a dive ? " " You forget I 'm a minister of the Gospel , " I said quietly , turning to face her with perhaps some stiffness . " I have to keep up appearances . " I went on with the air of one repeatingsomething he had explained fully more than once before .

"  |p105THE  Coker is a nine-story building of no specifiablecolor but leaning more to gray than to brown , though the bricks beneath the film of soot that covers it are brown , and of no architectural interest save its inclination toward the building next to it at an angle seemingly in excess. of the survivable degree . Three stone steps grayer than the building lead to a revolving door flanked by two swingingones . On the day on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cardboard served to patch a broken pane in the former . " Snowdrift Cake Flour , " I read as I bumped through a segment of it with the luggage . The suitcase I carried was my own Gladstone bag and contained , rather than ballast garnered in vacant lots , the normal changes of clothing and grooming appurtenances a man would take on an overnight trip , which was what I had told Hester I was away on . I said I was running down to New York for a day or two to look up some source material for my book at the public library . In addition to this I carriedMolly 's cosmetics case , into which she had tucked a nightgown and a few other odds and ends . She had told her mother she was staying with a girl friend . She had taken a phenobarbital to relax her before setting forth , and had anotherin her handbag in case it was needed . It was duskp106when we entered the hotel and the lights were on in the lobby . The time was also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which we had resolved on this course . The TestimonialDinner had had the effect of sobering us to volunteeredrestraint , apart from its public extortion , and then the Christmas spirit had come along and thrown cold water on the project by prolonging the period in which it would n't have seemed " right " to go to the Coker , and all in all it was n't till nearly February of the new year that we felt anything like physically and emotionally able to proceed with our plan . I was exhausted when I reached the desk , where I dropped the two bags with a thud behind a couple who were ahead of us . It was at this juncture that I recalled that the Coker is banally known as the John Smith . I tried to study the couple 's faces for signs of self-consciousness , furtiveness , excessive nonchalance or melancholy ( the last being what I personally mainly exuded ) , but the man was writing in the register with his back to me and the girl drifted over to the magazine rack . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents , could itself have been found in a vacant lot . I peered over his shoulder and saw him sign " Mr. and Mrs. Harry McQuade . " I suddenly realized that I had as yet neglected to choose a pseudonym for myself ! I frantically put my mind to it , but panic froze it solid . Luckilythere was some conversation between the guest and the desk clerk , and I had time to think of something suitable . That done , I felt a little more secure . I smiled at Molly , who stood a short distance off  --  the offhand inexpressive smile common to married couples . Her response was a tremulous twitching of the lips that made me look at the floor . She turned and walked to the water fountain beside the magazine rack , where the other girl was still browsing.  |p107She  dug something out of her handbag , put it in her mouth , and bent over to drink from the fountain . I wrote " Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas Plantagenet " on the registration card in bold flourishes . My theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be convincing , because nobody would make up a name like that . A bellboy appeared , rather to my surprise , and took us up to room 518 . The elevator was piloted jerkily upward by a youth who read a comic magazine on the way and sniffed continually through one nostril . The bellboy held his head straight but rolled his eye at Molly once . She looked down and drew a glove on tighter . The room managed to be cold and muggy at the same time . The bellhop made a great show of snapping on lights and feeling radiators by way of implying " appointments " which the room simply did not have , till I packed him off with a dollar bill . Finally the door was closed . I squatted to peer through the keyhole , but there seemed no eye on the reverse side looking in . I locked the door softly and turned back into the room , and this was the moment round which all my ravenous daydreams had wound : the moment when Molly would cry " Alone at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung herself into the only chair in the room and burst into tears . I stood watching her inactively . My mouth was dry and had a metallic taste . " What . " " If you could see yourself in that derby , " she said , in accentsthat seemed , apart from the content of the statement , shrieks of genuine grief . " I 'll get us a drink . Usual for you , dear ? " I hung up the derby which I 'd been holding and sat downp108on the bed to phone down . I imagined that we were on our honeymoon and that brides behaved in this way . The switchboard operator seemed amused at the implicationthat they had room service , but gratefully so , as though that was the nicest thing anybody had said to them in a long time . " This is a real dive , " I said to Molly after I had hung up . Molly was doubled over in the chair with her forehead touching her knees . Her bag lay on the floor , open . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather far from the revels for which we had come and whose existenceI had not suspected , but which was instructive and stimulating in itself and calculated greatly to widen my horizons . I felt a trickle of perspiration go down my torso . I picked up the fallen handbag and set it on the night table . I watched Molly a moment longer . Then I snapped my fingers , remembering something , and turned to the bed across the foot of which the bellboy had hurled the suitcase . " I nearly forgot . My Bellows . " " You 're going to start a fire ? " she said , looking wildly around for a hearth . " No , whiskey . I took a pint along just in case . " With that she burst into peals which were like nothing I had heard , or hope to hear again . I hurried with the whiskey , pouring her a copious drink into a glass which I got from the bathroom , first removing a mote of matter from its rim . " Here . Take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed its own shaking  --  and put the glass to her lips . She drank it all , dried her eyes and took my hand . " I 'm sorry . " " I know . This sort of thing is n't for us , " I said , running a disdainful eye around the interior.  | " Let 's go . " " No . It would look funny if we left right away . Come lie down a while . " I took her coat and hat from her and settled her on the bed , which was hard as a rock . I drew the pillow out from under the spread and laid it under her head . Then I took control of the situation . " Now then . You 've taken the other sedative . That makes two . That ought to calm you down fairly soon , and you 'll be all right . Just relax . " She ground out a hollow in the pillow with her head and smiled up at me . " Maybe I 'll be O.K. pretty soon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known my relief at finding her otherwise than skilled at profane love . No one with a casual past could have exhibited such signs of nervousness . If the hour were completely botched , it could do no worse than change to soaring joy the one doubt I 'd carried in my heart for months . " I 'll go out and get us some sandwiches , as long as there 's no room service . We 'll want something later , anyway . There 's a famous delicatessen on this block  --  the neighborhood has some compensations  --  and we 'll have a snack of supper . Pastrami O.K. ? " She smiled wanly and nodded from the bed . I felt more than ever like a newlywed foraging for his bride , as apprehension gave way to the proper emotion of tenderness , and I blew her a kiss from the door . " Be sure the door is locked behind me , " I said softly , and , taking the second of two keys from the dresser , went out . I removed the pastrami sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and slipped one , wrapped in its own wax paper , into each of my overcoatp110pockets . I did n't want the hotel personnel to see me carryinganything up to my room , for some reason . I hummed as I mounted in the elevator , which was operated by the same comic-reading youth . I went down the corridor to 518 with the key in my hand . I fitted it into the lock . The key turned in it but the door would n't open . Molly had turned the bolt , which was apart from the key , from the inside . I rapped on the door . There was no stir in the room . I knocked louder , then louder , till I was afraid of creating a disturbance . Still no answer . The muted strains of Calypso music came from a radio in a linen closet nearby . I leaned toward the door and put my ear to the crack . All I felt was a minute draft blow into it . The radio music momentarilystopped , and I caught the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sedatives had taken effect . I stood a moment in the darkened corridor , debating what to do . Two barbitals were quite a dose , and there was little hope of awakening Molly without bringing heads from every other door on the floor as well . I went back down to the lobby to think things over . I sat in a chair for some time without coming to any conclusion except that Molly certainly needed the rest and that I probably should n't awaken her too soon . I divertedmyself by studying the faces of guests in other chairs . They sat under potted palms reading or smoking or doing nothing . I soon tired of this . A half-hour had passed , I saw by a clock which said six-twenty . I tried to calculate the hours Molly might remain oblivious under present sedation , but my ignorance of the tablet strength vitiated any arithmetic . In any case , two made a substantial dosage to have to take into account in the night 's adventure . I was very hungry . Changing my chair to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sandwiches from myp111pocket and unwrapped it on my knee . Making sure I was not seen , I bit into it . It was delicious , and accompanied by a spear of dill pickle that was also capital . I , remembered that Molly did n't like pickles , and took the one from her sandwich and added it to my repast . I picked the last remainingcrumbs from the wax paper with a moistened finger-end and dropped the wax paper into a large ashtray . It was one of those tall heavy-based ashtrays that right themselves no matter how far you tip them , and for a few minutes I amused myself by slapping this one down and watching it swing up again . I noticed that a girl attending the newsstandwas looking , and stopped . It was ten minutes to seven . I had sat there an hour already . How much longer ? If Molly slept the clock around , as well she might , I would be here all night . The only alternativewas to rent another room for myself for the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to engage it in another hotel . There was one across the street . Then I realized that I could telephone Molly . I got laughinglyto my feet to do so . However , on the way to the phone booth I checked myself . Why not let the poor girl have an hour or two more in dreamland ? Slie certainly needed it . It had all been a terrible strain . I would go out for a walk . Strolling down the street , I found myself approaching the movie district . I recognized one of " our " theaters . Why not take in a film ? It would help pass the time . I consulted a marquee or two and chose a picture that had Kim Novak in it . I paid my admission and darted hopefully inside . Kim Novak was my favorite actress , and as I settled down in my seat I wondered why . I thought about it as I ate the second sandwich , and at length worked out a theory that seemed cogent . I decided , watching her now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impalpable . She was a soft gold cloud of a girl , who drifted through scene after scene of the utmost intimacy without being there . She had flung herself on Frank Sinatra 's racked body without being there . She had died in Tyrone Power 's arms without being there . She was flawlessly unpresent , weaving an abstraction called love . I ran into the lobby for a Hershey bar , still ravenous , and ate it in my seat with the wrapper peeled down . A scrap of foil got between my teeth as I nibbled in the dark , and I had a time fishing it out . I dropped the wadded-up wrapper under my chair , settled my coat on my knee , and slumped drowsily down . After a while I dozed off . I awoke with a jerk in the middle of the co-feature . Pirateswith drawn knives were pouring out of a hatch and yelling mutinously . I scrambled to my feet and made for the phone booth in the lounge downstairs , my overcoat flyingbehind me . What if Molly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes to ten . When the hotel switchboard operator answered , I could n't remember my room number . " Just a minute , " I said , fumbling for the key in my overcoat pocket . But I could n't read the tag in the booth , where the light was broken . I 'd had to dial the operator to get me the number . " Are Mr. and Mrs. Plantagenet registered there ? " I said . " I'lI give you room information . " They were registered there , and presently I heard the room phone ringing . Twice , three times . . . " Keep ringing , " I told the operator . " I know they 're there . " " Would you like us to page Mr. Plantagenet ? " " No , that wo n't be necessary . Just ring again please . " She did , and finally I heard MoIly 's sleepy voice say " Yes ? " " Darling , it 's me . Look , you 've got the door latched . Thatlittle round knob , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " So sorry , " she mumbled . " ' Bye , " and hung up . I got into the room this time all right , but she was asleep again when I arrived there . She lay sprawled over in a pale nightgown , the covers kicked down in a jumble at her feet . She muttered apologies as I began to get ready for bed , liftingan arm and letting it flop again as if in some cryptic salute to my durability under the stern demands of the hour . I soaked in the tub for half an hour and then brushed my teeth . I drew on fresh red silk pajamas and sat in the chair drinking  --  a habit I seemed to be acquiring . I had three or four whiskeys-and-water , raised the window an inch or two , turned out the light and went to bed , where I soon fell into a deep , if not exactly untroubled , sleep . I awoke from a horrible nightmare . I dreamed that Mrs. Calico had put down roots at a garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sitting on the grass with the other guests , and when it came time to go was found to be unable to rise , being affixed to the lawn . It took the combinedefforts of two men pulling her by the arms to uproot her , and when she finally came free it was with a tearing sound , taking a great deal of sod with her . I came to to see Molly bending over me , shushing me and trying to quell my threshing arms . " Wake up , " she was whispering . " Sh ! Wake up and be quiet . " " What sa mah ? " I mumbled , sitting up frantically . " Where are we ? Wha 's ' is ? " " Sh ! We 're in a hotel room . We 're at the Coker . Are you awake ? " I now appeared to be , and she asked , " My God , what did you dream ? " It was broad daylight . The room swam into focus , without , however , remaining precisely fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the dizziness that comes from the so-called middle ear disturbance with which I am recurrently troubled . Under this arrangement , the room in which a patient is lying tends to rotate in a steady flow , like the picture in a television set that is in need of vertical tuning . It 's something like the sensation that arises from a hangover . The difficulty seems to be caused by a circulatory distention affecting the balancing apparatus in the middle ear , and is said to be the result of emotional tensionor stress . It is often accompanied by marked , though never conclusive , nausea . " Do you have some aspirin ? " I asked Molly . She was still bending over me . Her features were mangled with sleep , and one eye was glued shut . She looked strange and even a little sinister . " I believe so , " she said , and turned away to get them from her bag on the bedside table , where I had put it . She started to leave the bed to get me a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " No . Let me . " I faced the crucial discovery of learning just how dizzy I was . If it was bad , I would be bedridden for a day or two ; if not , it would wear off as I went about my normal activities . I put a foot carefully on the floor and sat up . The room wavered violentlyand I thought I was for it ; but then it settled , and when I rose and started for the bathroom it seemed a little better . Downing the two aspirin she had laid in my palm , I caught a look at myself in the bathroom mirror . I put the water glass down and inspected myself stoically . My face was pinched and blurred , so that I resembled a wire photo of myself . I thrust out my tongue to find it thick and deplorable . I turned it over and moodily inspected its underside . My pajama coat was open and I observed a morning ritualp115I have of punching my stomach to see if it is still satisfactorilyhard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances and dieting . It seemed all right now . To one side of it I have a reddish blue mark , like the governmentstamp on dressed beef . I went back to bed . Molly lay on her side , away from me , the covers up to her ears . " So sorry , " she said , her voice muffled . " I did n't think two pills could do that to you . Just absolutely doped . " " Think nothing of it , " I said . She said , cozily , " What was your nightmare ? " " I do n't remember . It was nothing . " " Of course you remember . What was it ? " I could n't very well tell her it was about her mother , so I related a nightmare I 'd had earlier in the week . " I dreamed I was in this barn , a kind of livery stable , really , and that I was n't an animal exactly , but not a human being either , " I said . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get down on all fours while a couple of characterswho seemed to know what they were doing started to brush me down . Brushes and curry combs and one thing and another , just as though I were a horse . After a while somebodycame in and asked what the big idea was . And one of the men with the brushes said , He 's being groomed for an executive position . ' " She gave a single , indolent laugh , and then , turning over , slipped an arm around my waist . I snuggled over closer and put mine around her . My dizziness was going to be all right , thank God , but I was still dizzy , and the headache was as splitting as ever , so any ardors beyond an inert embrace was simply more than could be confidently undertaken at the moment . " This is just plain not for us , " I said , giving the room ap116contemptuous glance as it went by . " We want it to be beautiful . We want it to be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purity . " So dopey , " she murmured , and dropped off again . After a half hour of listening to her quiet breathing , and of strokingher hair and inhaling her delicate scent , I climbed carefully out from under the covers to shave . I was oddly exhilarated . I felt our failure to have sprung from elements that lay somewhere close to the heart of human worth . Think how we would have felt if we had done what we had come to this cheap hotel to do . Now the cheap hotel was part of our triumph , a pleasant memory to carry into married life instead of an embarrassment . Too , I derived from the whole experience that sense of widened horizons in sexual matters , of understanding women , and of the mastery over them . As I was buttoning my shirt in the room , a few minutes later , something shot toward the bathroom on the edge of my vision . It was Molly , clutching a dress which she had snatched out of the closet on springing out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , " she said . " It 's half-past ten . I thought my watch was stopped from last night but it is n't . Mother 's spelling me till I get there , but I do n't want to arrive too late . What if she takes it into her head to phone this girl I 'm supposed to be staying with ? " Most of this came from behind the slammed bathroom door . When she came out again , wriggling into her dress , I felt a lash of desire . " Darling , " I said , " let 's wait till tonight . I ca n't wait to have you , and we may be in the mood then . " " I ca n't possibly stay out another night . Mother thinks there 's something fishy already . "  |p117I  sighed , and walked to the dresser to tie my tie . " I suppose . But I 'll be lonely here tonight . " " Tonight ? " " I told Hester I was going to New York for a couple of days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't really go home till tomorrow . " . In the mirror , I saw her walk over . She stood looking hard at my reflection . " You mean you have to account to her ? With stories ? Like a wife , for heaven 's sake ? " " What did you tell your mother ? " " That 's different and you know it . But this woman  --  you might as well be married to her . " I went on lining up the ends of my tie in preparation for knotting it . " Now look . You do something about her and do it right away . She 's the roadblock and you know what I mean , " Molly said . " Right . So your rival turns out to be flesh and blood after all , and not a spiritual one , " I said . " Do n't you feel betteralready , sweets ? " " Ah ! I 'm glad to hear you use that word at last . It 's been on the tip of my tongue for weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't sure . Now you 've said it . It 's out in the open . She 's my rival , and I think now we understandeach other . " She tapped her palm with a hairbrush , fixing me in the mirror . " Do n't we ? " " Of course . I know what you mean . And I 'll do something about it right away . You watch . " " I do n't care how you do it  --  tell her off , give her notice , throw her out of the house  --  but get that woman off my neck . This may sound tough , but everything 's fair in lovep118and war , as she herself seems to know ! She 's got you under her thumb like a husband , and we 're going to fix that ! " I continued tying my tie , knotting it so as to conceal a small grease spot on one of the stripes , by way of outwitting my dry cleaner . " I mean it , Andy . Make it plain who 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence . " " Yes , dear , " I said , with a sardonic smile that pretty much soured the remains of that hour together . We finished dressing and went down for a bite of breakfast , and after breakfast Molly , who had taken her overnight bag with her , got into a cab and hurried to the office . I had an extra cup of coffee , which I drank in pleasant leisure . ' With a decent breakfast under my belt I felt a lot better too . The dizziness was about gone and my headache was clearing up . After paying my check I went out for a walk . I was conscious of the stores I passed , looking for a place where I might pick up a little something for Hester , who probably expected a trinket of some sort from my trip to New York . Besides , it was important to keep her in a good frame of mind if I expected to throw her out of the house.  |p119I  GOT caught in a shower during the course of my stroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop . As I was waiting for the rain to let up , a car with a vision of a girl at the wheel glided to a stop . She was going to park at the curb there . A patrician head and a fine throat leading to some cleavage warned me what I was in for . I gritted my teeth and looked for defects . There was no incompetence in the way she parked the car ; it was whipped into place with shattering skill . She rolled the windows up tight and appraised the downpour , debating whether to wait in the car or make a dash for it . Her hair fell in one angelic torrent to her shoulders , and was blond . Did n't it seem , though , to come rather far down on her forehead ? It would prevent needless suffering if so , for a low brow would definitely undo that face . She leaned to crank the window on the curb side down and looked up at the sky , her teeth flashing in a grimace . A gust of wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that my first impression had been wrong : the brow was clear and symmetrical after all , and a ripe red mouth added to what must be borne . Two alternatives are always posed me at this stage of thep120game , which is crucial , and they are precisely those of gambling . I can quit while I 'm losing but still have a few coins of doubt to jingle in my pockets , or I can stay and play the possibility of thick ankles or a bad gait 's canceling out my turmoil against , of course , that of a voluptuous figure 's intensifyingit . In other words , double or nothing . I stood irresolutely under the dripping awning . The girl looked out again , keys in hand . Suddenly she jerked the door handle down and sprang out . Getting out of the car exposed a span of thigh that stung my vitals . The ankles were finely hewn and swelled into shapely calves . She slammed the door shut and scurried underthe awning . She was standing beside me . I looked the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glance . Ah , her chin was imperfect , and thank God there were blemishes on her skin . I developed this . The skin was quite rough , was it not ? She would be like that all over : heavy and coarse and reddish along the neck on down to the shoulders , and from there to the breasts , the hips , the thighs turned in voluptuous languor  --  Hey , how about the rough complexion ?  --  I pasted my mouth to hers and we were rocking through the American night in a Pullman berth , then drifting aboard ship through delinquent seas , and each morning at breakfast  --  Breakfast , that was it  --  the way off the hook . Every time she opened that stupid mouth you would shudder and curse the day you laid eyes on her . I must make her say something  --  anything  --  to confirmthis . A phrase , even the inflection of a laugh could betraythe entire mental level . " I 'm waiting for the weather report to take hold , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not respond , save top121cast me a sidelong look . I tried again . Her manner itself did suggest a lack of style , a certain want of esprit . I hurried hopefully on with the business of flunking her , out . A word would do it , but I must actually hear her speak . " Do you have far to go ? " Her manner now had esprit . The look she gave me was crisp and not tentative , and ended in visual reference to a policeman reporting at a call box across the street . I excused myself and ducked into the shop . Taking stock , I found myself in a book and greeting card store . A salesman was advancing with a smile , with a pantomimeof soaping his hands . " Yes ? " " Just browsing , " I said , " if I may . " " Certainly . " I might have done worse . As I was looking , it struck me that a book might be a good solution for Hester . I went to the fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye was caught by a corner shelf of art books . Among them was an album of Rousseau prints . I remembered hearing her say she liked Rousseau and I bought it . I asked the man to gift-wrap it , which he did , using , I was glad to notice , paper without the name of the store on it . By the time he had finishedtying the ribbon around it the girl was gone . The rain had stopped too , and I stepped briskly along the street with my purchase under my arm , consoling myself with the knowledge that the girl was a goose and certainly deserving of the zero I gave her on the score of intellect . I watched Hester unwrap the package and exclaim with delight when she saw what it was . " Something for the house , " she said . " Why , how nice . " " No , no , it 's for you . I thought you said once youp122liked Rousseau . He 's not a particular passion of mine , but anyhoo ... " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She came over to the kitchen sink where I was standing to give me a kiss . Then she sat down again in her chair at the breakfast table and took a closer look at the individual prints in the album . " I 'll have them framed , " she said at last . " All of them ? " " It 'd be a pity to break them up . They go together so beautifully , as a set . " " Where would you put them ? " She considered the question , mentally scanning all of the house she could not see from there . " I 'd run them up the wall along the hall steps , " she said at last . " That gray wallpaper always looks bare to me , and these would brighten it up a lot . " . " Look , " I said , " I do n't want eight Rousseau prints marching up the stairs with me every time I go up , and down every time I go down . I do n't want them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You do n't ? " she said in surprise . " Well , there 's no rush . We 'll figure out a place . But they are just lovely , Andrew . Thanks so much . " I remained leaning against the sink long enough to watch her put the album aside in the wrapping paper . Then I walked over and stood behind my own customary kitchen chair . I faced her , gripping its back . " Hester , " I said , " I would like to get married again . " " Oh ? " " But there are obstacles . " " What do you mean , Andrew ? Like what ? " In keeping with my injunction to dress more casually around the house she had appeared in a loose-fitting neg/ligee that seemed to consist of a silk morning wrap over her nightgown . She poured me a cup of coffee and depressed the latch of the toaster in which two slices of bread stood ready . " Like this endless memorial , " I said . I drew my chair out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian hand in all this ? " " But why  --  ? " " To keep me prisoner in the same emotion in which you choose to incarcerate yourself . What you want to do with your own life is your business , but what if I refuse to spend the rest of mine dissipating my normal energies into a succession of respectable intervals ! " " Really , Andrew , " she said gently . " I ca n't help it . All I want to do is live happily again with another woman . It 's as simple as that , damn it ! I 'm sorry I ca n't share your well-intentioned but believe me unrealisticallynarrow plan for perpetual mourning . " " Not mourning  --  celebration ! " " It comes to the same thing . A situation where it would be gauche to marry . You ca n't ring wedding bells while that other bell keeps tolling . Can you now ? " I demanded . She shrugged , not to express indifference but a kind of earnest deference . " Why , I think you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in your future , " she said , passing me the cream . " Whom did you have in mind ? " " Miss Calico . " " Molly ! " " I knew you 'd approve . " I poured some cream into my coffee . " But how can I with all this going on ? Now the last straw , they 've put Molly on the Ida May Committee . Did you give her name to Mrs. Comstock as a Willing Woman ? " " But you  --  "  | " Yes , I know . But the way it turned out , as well as the speed , makes it seem a little fishy , if I may say so . You threw up quite a roadblock , girlie . " " But why should I want to do such a thing ? You 've only told me now what 's between you . How could I have known that then ? " My charge was a difficult one to support short of admittingthat I went around peering through keyholes . I now felt an irritation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women were always spurring men on to hit the boss for a raise or to speak to so and so about this or that  --  generally to wage aggressions they themselves harbored . I suddenly remembered that from my own eight years of marriage . However , there was nothing to do now but accelerate the offensive in the hope of inciting evidence of its justice . " You do n't want me to get married again , " I said . " That 's clear . " " Why do n't I ? " " Because of this hero worship of your sister . That unhealthyemotion I was telling you about . " She lowered her eyes . I plowed ahead with renewed confidence . " Why do n't you go out with boy friends ? " I said . " I do n't think this sheltered life is good for you . Purity carried to an extreme becomes its own opposite . Remy de Gourmont classifieschastity as a form of sexual perversion . " " Well , every man to his own taste . " I twisted my napkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were wringing water out of it . " Rejecting all men is a species of promiscuity . " The neglected toast sent up a black billow of smoke . Hester took the ruined slices away and opened the door to clear the kitchen . Ip125watched her dig fresh slices out of their wax wrapper and slip them into the toaster slots . " So forget me . It 's you we 're worrying about , " I went on . " You 're a girl in danger of more serious psychological consequencesthan you may realize . You 'll go from Dr. Chaucer to von Pantz , now I warn you . You 're tense , pale , and the victim of what I know to be an uncommonly strait-laced family . Oh , I know your family , my dear , and I 'm not surprised at the end product I see : that sick orchid of Puritanism , a hysterical woman ! " Intoxicated by my own words , I saw all the elements in the situation rush into place about a dramatic cliche like filings around a magnet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came vividly to mind . Hester scraped her chair back and crossed her legs away from the table . I was aware of folds of silk falling about her legs , and of bare thighs beneath the silk nestling warmly against one another . What other garments ? " We must put an end to these morbid thoughts ! There 's not a moment to lose ! " I exclaimed , rising . " The mind is like a balloon that 'll stretch just so far , and then  --  bang . " Hester pressed the tablecloth flat with her fingertips and stared thoughtfully while the second pair of bread slices went on to incineration . " Mother always used to say you ca n't run away from something that 's inside of you , " she said . " She has gone to her reward . " " Just what do you expect of me ? Just what did you want me to do ? " " Give me a break . You 're close to the central commissariatof women , " I said , a humorous name by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal of weight . I need an ally in the parish before I come out in thep126open about this . You got me into this spot so it 's only fair that you get me out . I just want to get out from under long enough to get married . So take up my cause , around town and all . Give this your blessing . Would you do that , and thereby be a pal ? Otherwise the situation between us must be considered insupportable , and I shall expect your notice in the morning . " " Will she keep her job ? It 's hard for a woman to mix marriageand a career . " " It 's sometimes no cinch for a man either ! So take up my cause , say this is O.K. and all , around town . Be a matchmakereven . And stop all these confounded commemora-tions ! " She rose to dispose of the new batch of burnt toast . " Well , I do n't agree with you there . Mother had her quirks , it 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she herself was left-handed . And other things . But she did say this one thing about family loyalties . That if ever  --  Andrew , what is the matter with you ? " I was sitting with my head bowed in my hands , shaking it . " So it 's Mother we 're bucking . The inextirpable and quenchless Mama again . Mama who would want this , Mama we 're obeying across the years as well as Sis we 're still playing those duets with . You must go to von Pantz . There 's not a moment to lose . " " Listen to me , Andrew . Listen . Mother always said that if anything should stick together it 's families  --  " " That all-devouring and agglutinate mass . I 'll make an appointment . " " Families are the links in the chain that gives man the only immortality he has . Human continuity was always sacredin our family . We almost made a kind of ancestor worshipof it . "  | " Fine , but do n't bury yourself with them ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You told me to read Korzybsk Winstead of the Bible , and I have , and Korzybski speaks of time binding , ' the ability to pass on from generation to generation that gives man his distinction above other forms of life . If survivalis n't true , then let 's make our own ! Let 's all pitch in and keep those we love alive . " " With adequate parking facilities ! " " Why not ? And I like the idea of a fountain . There was one in our garden when we were little girls in Belle Isle . " I raised my head . " Ah , then it was you who put that bug in Turnbull 's bonnettoo , " I said . " You 're at the bottom of everything . " She smiled a little . Her face shone now with a pleased radiance , as if she were the little girl again , watching the fountain plashing in the garden at Belle Isle , in that far-off time . She spoke with a gentle but firm resolve . " We will keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles of my face sagged into repose . " I see . " I rose and went to the office , where I took off my overcoatand slammed it down on top of my desk . It fell with its sleeve in the Out basket . I walked to the window shaking a cigarette from a pack , for I smoked habitually now too . I was halfway through it when I heard the front door open and my help arrive for work . Tabitha Twitchet or Molly Calico ? I remained at the window , not turning around . I heard whoever it was hang up her duds in the outer office and come to my open doorway , where she stood evaluating the set of my back , no doubt . " Good morning , " Molly said.  |p128I  greeted her and without delay related the events of breakfast . " So it 's worse than I thought , " I concluded . " We must get her to von Pantz . He is n't much , and God knows what he 'll do with a case of necromancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may be able to hack his way through this and give her some insight . It 's ironic though , winding up in the place founded by the person she 's mixed up about . " Molly was sitting in a chair , where she had been giving the impression of brushing cobwebs wearily from the surface of her face . Now she rose and looked at me openmouthed , with the expression but not the sound of laughter . " Mixed up ! Is that what you think this is all about ? Do you really for a minute believe that 's behind her shenani-gans ? " " I 've seen some queer things in my line of duty as pastor , " I told her in calm tones . " This is New England , you know . " " Oh , you fool ! How dense can you get ? She wants you . " I trundled my dictaphone toward the desk . " I 'm really terribly busy this morning . I 'll have another chapter of Maturity Comes of Age in an hour . or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maybe that 's why you could n't see it  --  because it was under your nose . But it 's perfectly obvious to another woman . She 'll keep this up till she 's got you married to her , and then this necromancy , as you call it , will vanish like a fog . You mark my words . " Molly followed me around the desk , and now stood pretty much over me , pointing toward the parsonage . " Now you go back there and do the whole thing over right . " " just what do you call right ? " I said . " And how do you propose I go about announcing myself as not eligible ? " " That 's your problem . But put your cards on the tablep129and make her do the same with hers . Smoke her out somehow , bring it all out in the open , and for the love of God , put an end to this mare 's nest ! " She turned away . She looked nowhere , and sliced the air with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how I feel , " she said apologetically . " Oh , Andy , I want to get married . " It was a protest , not an amorous cry , and I wisely did not try to turn it to amorous account . I watched unhappily as she turned and went to her own desk and drew the hood from her typewriter . The war of nerves was on . " Well , all right , " I said , " I 'll take another crack at it on that basis . But I 'll say one thing . I hope you know what I 'm doing . "  |p130MOLLY  'S theory could have been right or wrong , but right or wrong , there was nothing to lose by givingit a try . If her hunch was correct , then Hester 's removal as an obstacle to our plans could be achieved in a much subtler fashion than " throwing her out of the house " or " making her lay her cards on the table " : namely , by the elimination of myself as an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that simple . With that end in view , therefore , I set about the systematic depreciation of myself as a catch . I addressed myself first to the important and most obvious sphere , the domestic , by lapsing in matters of tidiness . I left my clothes lying about ; I put things where they did n't belong ; I was unpunctual for meals and irregular in my habits generally . I did all this gradually but nonetheless firmly , with marked changes in that previously well-run household . There was always something for Hester to pick up or to straighten out or to overlook . I left the knots in my ties and hung them on doorknobs and drawer handles , and I set wet towels on chairs in rooms into which I wandered with them . Smoking gave me a chance to be slovenly where there had been no contrary precedent of neatness , since I had just ac/quired the habit , and I made the most of it . I spilled ashes on the rugs and on myself , and doused cigarette ends in my coffeedregs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same with drink , another indulgence into which the strain of accumulating events had driven me . I never became a heavy drinker , but I was by now a daily one ; cocktails after a hard day at the office being a sine qua non . I would come home  --  at whatever hour caprice dictated and without reference to pre-arrangement  --  and immediately clatter up an Old-fashioned . I could overturn a kitchen foraging for incidentals , and moist paper napkins adhered like stamps to half the furniture when I was through . Dinner could wait even if it meant burnt dishes  --  for me to complain of when I finally did sit down . While I thus added ill temper to bad habits in the all-out drive to lose ground with Hester , her own mood of undamagedgood spirits in the early weeks of the experiment was a source of surprise , and made me wonder if it was n't going to take longer than I had anticipated . She would pick up my shirts and remove the knots from my neckties with no expressionbut a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouragement with my own . " How do you like the spaghetti ? " she asked at dinner one evening when we were having that . " Stringy . " She held up a bottle of Chianti in pleasant inquiry whether I would like more . I grunted affirmatively and extendedmy glass . I would have to pull out another stop . Feeding habits offered a particularly rich area in which to be deplorable , and I left no stone unturned there . I developed a disquieting procedure  --  at least to me . I would consumethe contents of one plate at a time , shove it aside and attack the next , and so on , downing large quantities of winep132or beer the while . Sometimes I carried whiskey to the table . When I had finished the spaghetti that evening , I broke off a crust of bread and swabbed my plate . " I thought you did n't like it , " Hester said , tossing a green salad . " My parents always taught us to clean our plate , no matterwhat , and they were right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly , and so my rejoinder rang true . " The waste in this country is appalling . It 's worse than the overeating . " " I agree with you . I never throw anything out if I can help it . To me the test of a good cook is what she can do with leftovers . Look , I know you prefer romaine , Andrew , but the only lettuce I could get today was the iceberg . I hope you do n't mind ? " She passed me a plate of greens . " And I hope the dressing is O.K. " I cleaned that dish as well , and praised the dessert , a fresh fruit cup doused with kirsch  --  a specialty of hers . I even took a small second helping . " Fruit is n't fattening , " she said , spooning it up . " This hatredof yours of fat in any form , " she went on after we had munched in unison a moment , " I wonder how many people realize that 's behind the quality in your sermons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I call you the Ernest Hemingwayof the pulpit ? " " No , I do n't care , " I grumbled indifferently . " I mean how many people realize you slave to keep them to ten minutes . I had to defend you to Mrs. Sponsible about that at the committee meeting last night . She said she did n't want to be bored by hour-long sermons either , but ten minutes . " " What did you say ? " " I told her the story of the man who had to write a long speech because he did n't have time to write a short one . "  | " Arid what did she say ? " " She said that was a speech , not a sermon . " " And what did you say ? " I fished a pip from between my teeth and laid it on my saucer . " I reminded her of the Sermon on the Mount , " said lies , ter , who , gazing between the candlesticks that bathed her cheeks in rose and gold , looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have said ? " I shoved my empty dish aside and tilted my chair back . I opened my mouth and prised a shred of pineapple from between my teeth with a finger . " That hit the spot , " I said . I was not losing ground , or not enough . I sensed that . I could see it . Each turn of the screw but gave her the more opportunity to show her own style . The only weapon in the war of nerves was calm . Still there was nothing for me to do but give the screw another turn . How ? Having lapsed in matters physical , there was nothing left to lapse in but the mental . My conversation became untoward . I told off-color stories . " It seems there was this parlormaid , " I said , as we sat in the living room with our after-dinner coffee one evening , " this maid who kept bumping into everybody . Running upstairs with a stack of linen she collided with the husband . The next day she stumbled into the son who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into . Then into the grandfather going down cellar , and so on . So finally she said to the lady of the house , I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to leave , Mrs. Brompton . ' The woman said , Why ? ' The maid said , Well , I seem to be in the family way . " Good heavens , ' the woman said , the family way , what do you mean ? ' And the maid said , Well , first with your husband on the stairs , then with your son in the closet , and now with grandfather in the basement . ' "  |p134This  disgusted nobody but myself . Hester was on her knees , poking the fire , and a small crash of settling logs made her recoil with a laugh and rub the smoke from her eyes . She set the poker on its stand and walked back to her chair . " Why , I guess everybody wonders where all these stories come from that you hear , " she observed , reverting to the thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them originate in vaudeville and burlesque , and of course bawdy houses , but that ca n't account for all of them . Do you know an interestingexplanation I 've heard about who make a lot of the darn things up ? Prisoners . They 've got nothing to do all day and ca n't live a normal sex life so that energy gets turned inward . Does that make sense to you ? " " It certainly does , " I said emphatically . I took a sip of coffee , then picked up a glass of brandy I had poured myself , which instead of drinking I swirled pensively in my hand . I was thinking of something . I remembered the story of the convicts who numbered their stories , and how I had failed to get much of a rise out of Molly with it . I remembered humoras the mind 's magnetic needle , and its fame as a test of kinship . Across the room , Hester 's head was bowed as she stirred her coffee . I took a sip of brandy and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one about the convicts who were so used to one another 's stories that they just gave them numbers ? " I asked . " No , I have n't , " she said , detecting a subtle shift in mood . " Tell me . " She smiled expectantly . I told the story , drawing it out . I watched her as it neared its conclusion . " What 's the matter , is n't that a funny story ? ' Oh , sure , ' said the cellmate . But he do n't tell it right . ' " Hester set her cup down on the end table beside her chair.  |p135Then  she laid her head back and laughed . She brought a hand down on her knee in delight . She was naked except for skirt , blouse , underthings , stockings and shoes . r " Well , I think it 's funny too , " I said , gazing into the flames . " I do n't know whether it 's that funny . " Hester smiled into the fire . After a moment she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . Is that a shaggy dog story , Andy ? Maybe I 'm dumb , but I can never get it straight . Can you explain to me about that ? " " I would n't say that 's one , no . The basic thing shaggy dog stories have in common , I 'd say , is the kind of logical let-down ending  --  the reverse of the explosion produced by the conventional story through surprise and so on . A sort of calculated deflation that sets you down in the middle of nowhere , and that may be related to angst in the distance you find yourself from home . I preached a sermon about it a while back . " " I guess I missed that . Could you dig it out for me ? " " I think so . But I would n't call that a true shaggy dog , no . That 's just offbeat . " I felt that I had to get hold of myself . I was being bought off . I lit a cigarette and pitched the match in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broke down the front of my vest . " The rarer human sensibility becomes , the closer it gets to the logic of insanity , " I observed after a silence . " That 's why offbeat stories , to which intellectuals ' tastes so often run , are in a sense quite literally crazy : " " This has nothing to do with wit though  --  right ? " " Oh , no . Humor has its marshy edges , but wit must be clear as a bell . Abraham Lincoln has been made by legend into a sweet old codger , but actually he was an **26;11279;TOOLONG man . Jesus is presented by the evangelists as a bleeding heart , but he had a wit like a razor . Nine-tenths of what he said was repartee . Read the Gospels . You find him flashing ripostes at the Pharisees and dishing out aphorisms to his disciples one a minute . Of course he was an obvious neurotic . " " That 's a very interesting slant . You ought to do a sermon on it sometime . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip on the conversation . " We have insanity in our family , " I told her , " speaking of that . I had an aunt who was quite wacky all her days , and an uncle who was actually put away . Our uncle twice removed we called him  --  once for good . " " Well , everybody has some of that . " " Not as much as we , " I answered . " I mean really lockedupcrazy . This uncle used to urinate in his shoe and pour it out of the second-floor window , and one day he went out and came home leading a donkey he 'd bought , and they said , What did you buy a donkey for ? ' and he said , Because they 're cheaper than cows . ' " " That offbeat logic again . " " That 's not what I mean . I mean it 's always been there as far as I can make out , going back a bit . Of course it sometimesskips a generation but then there it is again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better look elsewhere . " I tilted back my brandy and finished it off . " I understand , " Hester said , nodding and smiling at me with the same look of infinite comprehension . I was now at my wit 's end  --  no closer to knowing whether I was barking up the right tree than when I had started this . There was only one way to find out for certain , and I took it.  | " Hester , have you got a date for the Kickoff Ball ? " I asked . The event in question was to mark the gve of actual ground-breaking for the Mackerel Plaza , early in March . So far municipal matters had come without my making an inch of private progress ! I had been promised another fresh spade by Centapong 's Hardware to turn over the first shovelful of earth . Hester shook her head over the needle-point she had taken up in her favorite chair in the bay window that gave the livingroom its spacious charm . " No , I have n't . Too busy preparing for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered with a laugh . I stood at the piano ticking off a few bass notes with one finger . " Would you care to go with me ? " Hester looked up from her sampler , which was a representation of Rossetti 's Blessed Damozel , shown leaning from the gold bar of Heaven with three lillies in her hand and seven stars in her hair . " Are n't you going with Molly ? " " Oh , now , Hester , stop this foolishness . You know damn well I ca n't be seen in public with another woman until this blows over . " " What am I ? " " That 's different . You 're the housekeeper . " It may have been the wrong thing to say to make the test acid , or the right . I would know in a second . Hester bent over her hoop again and for a time there was no sound exceptthat of punctured cloth and the dry rasp , curiously agreeable , of yarn being drawn through it . " No , Andrew , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not ? " " The circumstances . It would be awkward , as you say.  |p138Even  this way . Thank you just the same though . It was sweet of you . " I was waiting for Molly when she arrived for work the next morning . I was sweeping paper clips from the front office desk into my palm , like bread crumbs , and dropping them into their proper tray . " How 's Todarescu 's Weltschmerz ? " I asked . " All right I guess . I do n't know . " " I 've had it myself lately . All in through here . " " Well , what is it ? I can always tell when you 've got something to fire . You wait a minute before letting go  --  like hug it a minute . It 's a female trait , so do n't be proud of it , " she said . " O.K. , let 's have it . " " Well , " I said , wheeling around , " I took your advice , and I hope you enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What advice ? " " I acted on your theory . That Hester 's got her cap set for me . I asked her for a date and she turned me down . " Molly turned from the rack on which she was hanging her hat . " Date for what ? " she asked . " The Kickoff Ball . " " Well , I like that , " she said rather crisply . " What difference would it have made ? I 'm not going with you , " I answered in kind , nettled by the shift in grievancefrom myself to her . " Does that side of it mean more to you than the fact that I 've made a horse 's ass out of myself ? " In the strain and confusion of leading a double life I sometimes forgot where I was trying to tear myself down and where build myself up , and now I had blurted out in Molly 's presence an expression I had been trying to get up the courage to use in Hester's.  | " Well ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine way to greet me . " " I 'm sorry . " I circled the room , grinding a fist into my palm . " She 's winning . She 's dividing and conquering . She 's winning . " " Oh , stop chittering like a ninny and tell me what happened . I forgive you . But do n't ever use that expression to me again . I hate it . " " So do I ! " I said , spreading my hands at the wonder of it . " Happened ? I 've told you what happened . I asked to take her to the Plaza Ball and she turned me down . Cold . So much for your hypothesis . " Molly pondered intently the blotter pad on her desk . " So she 's trying to keep you guessing . " " You mean women are complicated ? Yeah , splain dat to me , Kingfish , splain dat to me . " " You need n't get sarcastic . What 's more natural , after she 's been wearing her heart on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nolo contendere , " I said , throwing up my hands , and walked into my office . " I do not contend . " I had my hand on the doorknob when she said : " Wait . There 's something a lot more serious than this . " " What ? " She seemed suddenly to change her mind with a vague sign of dread . " Not now . I 'm hoping it 's a false alarm . I wo n't burden you with it till I 'm sure it is n't . " I went to work , or tried to . I was doing a series of sermons based on the seven letters which the Voice instructed the author of Revelation to write to the seven churches in Asia Minor , each dealing with one of the faults or virtues common to human nature , then as now . I had preached four and just finished the one on Sardis , with Philadelphia andp140Laodicea still to come . " And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write . . . I know thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and art dead . " Sardis represented defectionfrom an ideal , wilted spirit . I was reading over what I had written when I was struck by something peculiar in the spelling of Sardis . I went up to Molly 's desk . " I notice you keep spelling this Sardi 's , ' " I said , showing her a passage where she had written , " Thou hast a few names even in Sardi 's which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white . ' I do n't care so much about the sermon script , but I hope you did n't give the text to the printer that way ? You might as well say Toots Shor 's . " " I 'll phone him and catch it , " she said . I smiled . " It 's not hard to see where your mind is . Do you wish you were back there now , in all that ? We 'll go to Sardi 's , you and I , the minute all this is cleared up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can see us there now . Hot cannelloni , steak with sauce bearnaise , tossed salad and cherriesjubilee . That about do it , sweets ? " " Well , we 'll see . " " What are you typing ? " " Eulogies of your wife , " she said . " For the souvenir booklet . Was she really so patient and understanding ? " " We could all learn a lesson from her . " Molly turned on the swivel chair to face me . " There 's gossip going around about you . In fact , scan-dal . " I stooped to pick up a match from the floor and drop it into a wastebasket . I hooked a rumpled rug to rights with my heel . " Oh ? Of what nature ? " I asked . " What do they say about me ? "  | " That you were seen going into the Coker with a woman . " " Who told you this ? " I demanded . " They did n't tell me  --  they told Mother . Qne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it their Duty , you know ? And Mother thought I should know . " I crossed to the front window , out of which I stood gazing into the street . " Did she say who the woman was that I was seen with ? Do they tell that part of it ? " " Evidently not . Whoever it was saw you go in apparently knew you but not me . " I asked the question that seemed to me logically next in line , at least from my point of view , and I made no effort to repress the rather sardonic smile that twisted across my lips as I did so . " And you , what are you saying in reply ? Will you stick by me ? Tell them you refuse to believe such a thing about me ? " " I told Mother that I was not interested in the talk of idle gossips . " " Idle ! They seem to be working twenty-four hours a day at it . " Neither of us spoke for a few moments . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May were only alive ! She 'd straighten this mess out in short order , believe you me . " Molly nodded , glancing at her day 's chore , the mound of encomium still to be transcribed . " I can well believe it , " she said dryly . Then : " If she were alive there 'd be nothing to straighten out . Maybe you wish that too . " " What puzzles me is , how do they know about us , ' that they feel there 's any occasion to protect you about me ? I thought we 've been doing a pretty good job of keeping it under the bush . " Something in the way she averted her eyesp142made me ask : " Is it your mother maybe who 's talked ? And the people she 's told have blabbed it around ? " " Oh , Andrew , " Molly answered restively , " what if she did ? Is n't Mother entitled to bosom friends just like the rest of us ? " It was soon enough that Tabitha Twitchet descended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call at the parsonage to pay her respects , and she called that very evening , if not especially to pay her respects . When she did , it was to find me  --  in words I would not have chosen to describe the circumstances under which I was next fated to be discovered , or dreamed would be applicable  --  " shaking a leg with a hot patootie. "  |p143AFTER  dinner Hester pushed aside a few livingroomchairs and rolled back the rug . " Well , if you 're game to help me brush up , maybe I 'll reconsiderabout the date . What I was really afraid of was how I 'd look out there on the floor after so long . Maybe we could both do with a little polishing up . What do you think ? " Mackerel did not know what to think . " You mean dance ? " " Yes . You 'll find me rusty , but if you insist ... " Mackerel 's own dancing could not be described as rusty so much as nonexistent . He watched Hester select and launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the room to the strains of " Jealousy , " which will be remembered as a well-known tango of its era . She had on a white polka dot blouse with a starched bow , whose corners scratched the base of his neck agreeably . Instead of wearing her hair in one knot in back , she wore it in two at the sides , like earphones , with bangs in front . She had a perfume rather subtler than the nasal flavors that had visited Mackerel hitherto , but which in the exertions of dancing soon suffused his brain in a delicate mist . When a tangle in their maneuverssent them against a table edge they both laughed , andp144insisted on the blame . " My two left feet , " he said . " Think I 'd better keep off the dance floor . " Neither of us heard the doorbell . The first notice I had of a caller was a sharp rapping on the window , and when I disengagedHester and parted the curtain , the shadowy figure of a woman on the porch , bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar face appraised me between a fur cap and a muff held at chest level . It was Mrs. Tittlemouse come to tea  --  or Tabitha Twitchet , or whatever . The apparitions shifted and changed according to how the nose twitched or the mouth pursed at the moment , while also blending into one . I very nearly greeted her as Mrs. Tittlemousebefore I caught myself and said , " Ah , Mrs. Calico ! Do come in . " She was already in . " Good evening , Mr. Mackerel , " she said . " What I have to say wo n't take long . " Her tone dispelled the image of any cozy tea , fostering instead that of a woolly one going about the business of maintaining standards among the forest people . I felt like a rabbit again , with the advance in illusion , this time , of having to reach up for the doorknob as I showed her into a small side room , where I received visitors come for religious instruction or to have their lives straightened out . She glanced back at Hester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record in its album sheath . " I shall come straight to the point , " she said when we were settled behind closed doors . She occupied a tall wingbackfrom which her toes barely grazed the rug . She declinedthe offer to remove her coat , as though fearing its theft , contenting herself with loosening its top button and laying her muff aside . " Mr. Mackerel , it has come to my attention that you are leading a double life . While courting my daughter you 've been carrying on with another womanp145at a place which , out of delicacy , I shall simply call place X. " " Oh , I would n't say that , " I answered . " There 's no use denying it . You have definitely been seen going into hotels with other women . " " Women ? " I said , dismayed by the plural . " Well , woman . The nature and number of your misdeeds are immaterial . One is as bad as a thousand . The fact that you could be guilty of such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The point of my call is to say that you are no longer welcome at Toits Rouges , and to adviseyou never to try to set foot inside it again unless you are prepared to deal with the police . " This was the first inkling I had of her house 's having a name , and the fact of a city street residence of normal size and circumstances possessing one was too much for me not to linger over . " Toits Rouges ? " " My nest in Timble Street that you 've abused , so named because of its red roofs . My second demand is the obvious one that you cease and desist from seeing my daughter , under pain of legal measures . " " What hotel did you hear it 's rumored I 'm alleged to have been seen going into ? " I asked , piling on as many subjunctivesas the sentence could hold without shattering its syntax . " Would you mind telling me that ? " Mrs. Calico shut her eyes and gripped the arm of a chair other than her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaster and had become intoxicated with peril . " The Coker . I can scarcely say it . " She caught her breath , and then gave way to a curiosity she could not repress . " Do you care to tell me who the woman is ? " May I never be one to slight the ideal of gallantry , butp146I hoped this brought to an end the number of women on whose behalf I would be called upon to exercise it . Still , I found the moment too tantalizing not to explore a speculationor two . " What if it were someone you knew ? " I put to her . " Knew very well . " " What is the use of frittering our time over manifest folderol ? " " But what if you did ? I mean the woman in a case like this is always the girl next door to somebody ? What if it were the girl next door to you ? To Toits Rouges ? " " I should move . " " What if it were Molly ? " Mrs. Calico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a manner that would have enabled me to play pat-a-cake with her if I were so minded . " Mr. Mackerel , let 's not sit here bandying absurdities . " " What if it were , though ? I 'm only trying to get your psychology . " " It would kill me , " she answered primly , as though the fact were a basis for pride , which perhaps it was . " Well , I ca n't divulge who the woman is , " I responded at last . " You understand that . " " Yes . You have at least that shred of decency . I suppose I would n't want to know anyway . " " No , you would n't want to know . " I then asked , " Now , will you tell me something . Who is your informant ? " " I ca n't divulge that . So we 're even , " she answered , a little illogically I felt . I nodded on receipt of this thought , rolling my underlipbetween thumb and forefinger . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because neither of us knew thep147point the discussion could be taken to have reached , but becausewe both knew very well . " Suppose I do n't do as you demand ? " I asked . " I mean apart from all this business about calling the police . SupposeI refuse to stop seeing your daughter but assume that she 's old enough to make up her own mind about this matter ? " " I have a lever . " Mrs. Calico raised her hand in a gesture as if implying a literal implement which she was prepared to bring down on my head . " Molly defends you now but that 's natural . She 's partial and run down . Mr. Todarescu defends you too , to his credit . " " That type would . Tie 's Bohemian , Mrs. Calico . I suppose you knew that . " " People ca n't help their nationality . " " That is true , but we must draw the line somewhere . Condoninghotel assignations indeed ! It 's part of the whole decayof moral standards that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have tea and chat of all these things . I did n't do it , so that 's that , and now we must talk of what concerns us so much more deeply . **25;11307;TOOLONG , dear me , what are we coming to . Cream or lemon ? " " Neither , for I do not wish tea , nor , Mr. Mackerel , do I intend to be led astray by such hanky-panky . " " But if he justifies my conduct then I am shocked . It was Todarescu who told tales , I 'll bet that 's it ! Ah , I can put it all together now . He saw me at the Coker  --  or saw somebody he mistook for me , rather  --  which is n't surprisingbecause that is a natural kind of environment for him , since he 's Bohemian , as I say . Or maybe one of his friends saw this person who looked like me . Then he reports itp148but only as a humorous story . He does n't condemn it in the least ! Will we talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop trying to confuseme with this fiddle-faddle , now there 's an end of it ! " Mrs. Calico said . " Where were we ? I was saying Molly defendsyou , as a woman would , for her taste is on trial . But I sha n't sit idly by and see her ruin her life by an alliance with a  --  socialist ! Scandal does n't blow over like a storm , it blows up like a fire . And , sir , if necessary , I shall be among those passing it on . " For the moment I was flabbergasted . Then I understood . " Is that your lever ? " I asked , genuinely aghast . " She 'll give up when it gets bad enough . If the only way I can save my daughter is to hurry matters along to that point , then so be it . I am fighting for my girl 's life . " The woman 's logic induced in me a feeling of nausea . At the same time I could n't help admiring her strategy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own Ladies Aid . There was a petard on which I could be hoisted sky-high in my own congregation . Events made me remember Molly 's visits to Mrs. Balsam and the premise that an astral hand was presiding over their crystallization . I shook off this tenth-rate speculation with a violent snort and returned to the main track of the discussion . " But do n't you see , Mrs. Calico , that adding to the scandalabout me will only tar her with the same brush , " I said . Here Mrs. Calico paused and seemed to assess her man with a canny little smile that was not unkindly . " Well , you wo n't sit idly by and watch that happen . Not if I know you . You 'll give her up yourself first . That shred of decency I mentioned a moment ago . Libertines are often not withoutit. "  | " Can I get you a drink ? " I asked , dabbing my brow with a handkerchief and casting a wistful eye at the door beyond which my bottled supplies lay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jangling and Hester 's footsteps going to answer it . " Drink , that 's another habit you managed to keep from me . I 'm sure you have pleasures enough to console you for the loss of my daughter . " Mrs. Calico glanced meaningly at the door . " I did n't realize you danced . You like to shake a leg with a hot patootie now and then , do you ? " " Well , not very good at it , actually , " I answered idiotically . " No , thank you , no drink . " That arrested my passage to the door . When I turned back , it was to discern in Mrs. Calico 's mien a sudden radical change . She sat with head bowed , as under the weight of turpitudes now revealed . She shook her head and moaned softly . " Oh , what a blow , " she said , weeping into a square of cambric . " What a blow I have received to my pride , my vanity , my very self-respect . To think my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I recalled that one of the Beatrix Potter illustrations had been of Tabitha Twitchet , the cat neighbor , lamenting to Mrs. Tiggy-winkle the disappearance of her son Thomas . He had been missing for some days . Mrs. Tiggy-winkle , the kindly aproned porcupine , was trying to comfort her . I begana consolatory gesture here , but it was not one I could bring to intelligent fruition and it died in midair as I heard a rap on the door . " It 's Mrs. Comstock calling for a committee of church women , " Hester said . " She says they want to see you as a delegation on something urgent . They 'd like to come immediatelyif it 's convenient . How 's nine o'clock ? "  |p150I  would throw them out on their ears on what Yeats has called " the pavements gray , " following which there would be an impossible situation ending in a period of total amnesia , after which I would be found in like Nashville or Albuquerque , cadging nickels to put into the slot machine . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would serve them right . ' Fell them to come ahead , " I said . " That will be all right . " I wound up my interview with Mrs. Calico , who rose , tucked her able hands into her muff and , her ultimatum quite deposited , took her leave with great dignity . Fifteen minutes later the other women arrived . I fully expected to be cooked in more of the same and I was not disappointed , but 1 was not prepared for the directionfrom which the women who came at nine approached the matter . They were supposedly just members of People 's Liberal , but I noticed that they were all also members of the Women 's Plaza Committee , and they lost no time in saying they had come to speak frankly of something that was embarrassing both to them and to the men who had their shoulders to the wheel on the riverfront project , namely the fact that I had , among a few chosen intimates and then more publicly , been " running down " the Mackerel Plaza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Mackerel would not be less than honest . He told them candidly that his objections were not to the memorial as such but to the commercial hay being made of it . " It 's no longer a monument , it 's a lot of contracts ! " I cried . " Fat ones ! " This was hardly the tone to take to the delegation 's spokeswoman , Mrs. Sponsible . She was normally a nicep151enough sort , but she was also wife of the owner of the excavatingfirm whose bulldozers stood ready to carry on from Mackerel 's inaugural ceremonial shovelful . Neither was it the thing to say to Mrs. Cool-Paintey , the mayor 's sister . ( Here I saw that the callers were all also the wives of interestedbusinessmen . ) She had means , of course , being old Meesum 's daughter . She had been educated in the best schools and as a result now said " Chewsday " for Tuesday and " jew " for due . Mrs. Sponsible had for years tried to copy her but it was no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hopelessly clearly . " If your husbands have a bone to pick with me , why do n't they call on me in person ? " I said . " Or do they feel they can catch more flies with honey ? I must say I 've seldom seen a better turned out group of ladies . Heh-heh-heh . " " We 're here for other reasons than your knocking the Plaza , " said a woman named Mrs. Comstock , Charlie Comstock'swife . " Now , now , Lily , " said a woman named Mrs. Krakauer . " Yes , let 's get the first point cleared up first  --  his criticismsof the Plaza , " said Mrs. Sponsible with flustered haste . There was a sense of something they dreaded getting to in the same degree that they itched to do so . " All right . " Mrs. Cool-Paintey screwed about in her chair the more directly to face me . " We feel an explanation is jew us . " " It is jew you and it has been given you , in a nutshell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-meaning gesture on Mr. Turnbull 's part has been parlayed into a gravy train of the most blatant sort by a pack of businessmen . " " Are you against business then , Mr. Mackerel ? " " Oh , my dear Mrs. Cool-Paintey . " Mrs. Sponsible entered the discussion.  | " The thing we feel , " she said , pondering the toe of a waggled foot with that studious attention women can give their shoes under apparently any circumstances , " is that you might desist , if only for your wife 's sake . " " She would have gone into the city hall and turned out the money changers long ago , " I said , and she would . I know that woman . ' Watch it , Hester 's warning glance told me from the cornerchair . The women had asked her to stay and sit in as an advisory member of the Plaza Committee , and I had certainly not demurred . Something warned me from another quarter too . I had recently written in a chapter of MaturityComes of Age , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his peril . The tribe will give him short shrift , especially after the myth has got its roots deep in the cash fabric of society . " And sure enough , Mrs. Comstock was saying , " Well , somebody has to get the contracts to build the monuments . And anyhow , Ida May deserves a whole big civic thing like this . I do n't care . She was a saint . " " She was not , " I said , sick of this fudge . " She was too . " " She was not . " " Perhaps , " interpolated Mrs. Krakauer , a peacemaker , " the truth lies somewhere in between . " " I knew her , " said Mrs. Comstock , ignoring this . " Most of us did . And most of us feel that her death was a fitting end to her life . A heroic sacrifice . " This was the specific myth . Was this the moment to spike that old windbag Turnbull 's legend ? To rise and say , " Ladies and gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had confided the facts to Hester and to no other ; it was the secret we shared . If she had known what was brewing in all this she had certainly given no sign . Turnbull was an oldp153fool , but it nonetheless brought to three the number of personson whose behalf I was being called upon to exercise grace . " I know what you mean , Mrs. Comstock , " I said , prudentlytaking in a little sail , " but I lived with her , and if I told you as her husband that she was a saint you 'd probably smile . I do n't want her canonized ! I do n't want her dehumanized  --  oh , yes , that 's what 's happening  --  I want to remember her as she was . I ca n't even recall what her voice sounded like for all this yacketing oratory . Let 's have some honesty , please ! Ida May was a brilliant woman , but she had her emotional limitations . " Mrs. Comstock rose stiffly . " Mr. Mackerel , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she said . " And I 'll thank you to use a little intelligence , if I am not asking the impossible , " I said , getting to my own feet . " Ida May was a creative person and they are at the farthest possible remove from saints  --  as I was at pains to explain in last Sunday 's sermon , and as you would remember if you had n't been asleep . " " I was awake . " " You were asleep . " There was another nervous stir from Mrs. Krakauer who appeared about to repeat that the truth probably lay somewhere in between . But Mrs. Cool-Paintey spoke first . She had majored in psychology , and it was out of her wide knowledge in that subject that she was constrained to say : " I wonder if I may go so far as to detect a note of professionaljealousy in Mr. Mackerel 's protests . He 's a creative person himself , and the one thing they can not stand is living under the shadow of another , more famous . .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think you 're wide of the mark there , Mrs. Cool-Paintey.  |p154If  I may be permitted to say a word here . " Smiling nods told her to go right ahead . " Andrew was always the soul of kindness toward my sister . I never heard him raise his voice to her the way he is to you tonight . They never quarreled . " " That 's not a good sign to me , " said Mrs. Sponsible , in about the voice level of soliloquy . " Oh , but we did , " I differed . " We did quarrel , often very bitterly . Mrs. Sponsible is quite right there . People must agree , to quarrel , as the Frenchman said . " Hester now got to her own feet . " Why do n't I make us some tea ? " she said . An excellent idea . Tea had the effect of loosening everyone'stongue , but on a more convivial level , and for a momentit seemed as if the danger of serious eruption had passed . The day might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with it that angered the women conclusively and drew the fire they had been holding back . What happened was this . I had braced myself for their arrival with a stiff drink , and now felt the need for another . Hester 's return with the tea gave me an idea . As she poured it , I was struck with its resemblance in color to bourbon ; in cups , the two fluids would be indistinguishable . If I could manage to fill one with whiskey I could sit there and sip it while the ladies did their tea and no one would be the wiser . I drifted to the sideboard just inside the adjacent dining room where she was pouring and offered to finish that while she went back to the kitchen for some Vienna fingers she announced having discovered . Before going , she threw me a last cautionary whisper about my remarks . " Do n't be an imbecile , you idiot ! " she said . " Do n't nag , " I whispered as she made off . Turning my back as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjured a bottle of Old Fitzgeraldfrom behind a door of the sideboard cabinet and filled one of the cups with it . I whipped the bottle back out of sight and set the cup on a saucer  --  or rather on one of the plates Hester had got out to accommodate the cookies we were going to have . So far so good . But here a crimp developed . Just then Hester returned from the kitchen bearing a tray on which were sugar and cream and the promised Vienna fingers , and as one the women rose with a babel of protest about being able to fend for themselves and of not having meant anybody to go to all that trouble . In a twinkling they were all elbowing about the sideboard , and in the ensuing confusion I lost complete track of the cup with the bourbon in it . In another trice they were all seated in the living room chatting again . To this extent the tea had been a happy idea . I picked up the last remaining cup and carried it to my chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less taste it . I preferred to be in doubt . They were talking about a man in an upstate city who had murdered his wife , three children , and mother-in-law . " When a thing like that happens , " Mrs. Cool-Paintey explained , " it shows that subconsciouslythat was what they wanted to do . " I held the ear of my cup firmly in my fingers , without touching the cup proper for fear of finding it hot . My eye met Mrs. Sponsible 's across the room and I thrust out my pinkie , smiling innocently . She lifted her cup , drank , and went on in a normal way . So it was n't she who had drawn the whiskey . That was one accounted for . My gaze went down and in that second I detected a pale smudge on the side of my cup , which could only be the cream filling of the Vienna finger melting against it . I raised the cup to my lips , shutting my eyes . The beverage in it was tea  |p156I  ran my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whiskey ? It was like Russian roulette . Six cups like six chambers in a pistol , one with the bullet . Mrs. Sponsible and I were ruled out . That left Mrs. Comstock , Mrs. CoolPaintey , Mrs. Krakauer and , of course , Hester . Maybe Hesterhad drawn it . Dear God , let her be the one . Then she drank and took a nibble of her cookie  --  dashing that possibility . I now pinned my hopes on Mrs. Krakauer . She was a slight , gentle woman with a sadly tolerant nature . By all means it must be she . . . I wiped my brow . Russian roulettewith teacups . Add to which the grim detail that the whiskey might now have cream and sugar in it . I closed my eyes and waited . " Perhaps some arrangement can be worked out satisfactoryto both Mr. Mackerel and the business element , " Mrs. Comstock was saying . " I mean get the fountain and the Plaza dissociated from the shopping center . See to it that it does n't get to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of that ? " I nodded , my eyes closed . " Fine . " " I mean if we all try to be reasonable , one give a little here , the other give a little there , why , I 'm sure the differencescan be ironed out . So I move a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce , say , which Mr. Mackerel will attendand air his views . " There was a violent spluttering followed by severe and prolonged coughing . It was Mrs. Cool-Paintey . She had taken a gulp large enough to have choked her , with enough left over to be liberally spraying the woman seated next to her , which happened to be Mrs. Comstock . " What in the world ? " When Mackerel could bring himself to look it was to find the two women sitting face to face wiping one an/other 's dress fronts with their handkerchiefs . The scene had the exotic gravity of some obscure rite from the comprehensionof which all those not directly . engaged in it were barred , even those witnessing it at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cool-Paintey wheezed , when she could speak at all . " I 'll say it is n't ! " said Mrs. Comstock , sniffing . This was the woman whose husband was the reformed alcoholic , and whose horror of the very word was sufficient to make her turn and regard Mackerel with speculative interest ; with new eyes , as the phrase goes . Mackerel did something he knew he should n't have but which he was powerless to restrain . He smiled . He lowered his head and shook it , settinghis , plate and cup down . " I 'm sorry , " he said , laughing now . " I 'm terribly sorry . " " Maybe someone can tell me what this is all about , " Mrs. Cool-Paintey gasped in a piping whisper . Evidently some of it had gone down her Sunday throat . Mrs. Comstock could tell her . Half a lifetime of drinks sneaked behind her back and of bottles routed from extraordinaryhiding places equipped her to recognize the true boozer at a glance . " It 's whiskey , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacups yet , so we would n't know . He just had to have one . He could n't wait . Well , the Lord took care of that little trick , did n't he , Reverend Mackerel ? I 'd never have believed it , but now I 've seen it . The thing is , secret drinkers can sometimes go on for years unsuspected . Now it 's out . We 've seen it with our own eyes . And having seen that , maybe we can believe all the other we 've been hearing too . " " What other ? " Hester demanded . " Women . " " In hotel rooms , " Mrs. Cool-Paintey wheezed , and beganp158to cough again . She and Mrs. Comstock were still wiping away at one another 's fronts . They looked very sisterly . The scene was too grotesque for me to feel it could possibly be the setting for anything sinister , or to pose any serious threat , and so when Hester pressed on with " What hotel ? " I replied with ironic flippancy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's true , " said Mrs. Sponsible . " It 's what I 've heard said , " I answered listlessly . " I do n't believe it , " Hester said , her eyes flashing . She was on her feet . " I will not have such things being said in my house ! You ought to be ashamed . Idle gossips ! " " Idle , they work at it twenty-four hours a day , " said I , who felt the witticism worth a second use . Mrs. Comstock rose and pushed Hester . " Do n't you call me that . I never speak without reason . We have n't passed a word of this on  --  we 've only heard it . I 've had an open mind  --  up to now . " " Just because you can believe he drinks , you believe it all ? But he does n't . Oh , one or two now and then , sure , but not on the scale you think . Could I live with him day in and day out and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered with simple authority . She turned with a kind of ambiguous outrage to the circle as Hester stamped her foot , burst into tears and went upstairs . " Send them away and come to bed , " Hester said as she hurried off , completing the sense , which I had been increasinglyexperiencing , that I was in a madhouse . " You see what you 've done ? " I said to the women . Mrs. Cool-Paintey rose . Her voice was still a little rickety . " Shall we go ? I think we 've heard enough . Enough for our visit to have served its purpose , albeit a sad one . " There was a sorrowful sigh from Mrs. Krakauer . She was inclined by nature to charity , but she was far too buffaloedp159by words like " albeit " to press for it now . She followed the rest into the vestibule , where they crowded into the closet for their coats like sheep without a shepherd . I went to help them . It was then , as I approached the group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't catch clearly but that sounded like , " What makes me feel a fool is all the matchmaking we 've been doing . " " Matchmaking ? " I said , wedging my way through them into the closet . They looked embarrassed , and glared at one another . " Oh , well , let 's not go into that , " said Mrs. Krakauer , dropping her eyes . My curiosity was too keen to stem at this point . Ducking in among the coats , I said , " Am I to understand that you feel the parsonage should have a mistress ? Shall we put it that way ? " Mrs. Krakauer murmured another demurrer and was agreed with by one or two others . " All right , " I said , " I wo n't give you these coats till you tell me . " I had them all over my arms , four of them , worth thousands of dollars , if one included Mrs. Sponsible 's and Mrs. Cool-Paintey 's furs . " Just try to get them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We 'll get them back . " " If you insist on acting like children , " I said . Mrs. Cool-Paintey relented  --  if it was relenting and not turning the subject to punitive account . She was the injuredone , after all , and I could see her making it as part of my chastisement that I would know in full the womanly solicitudes from which I was to be exiled . " Naturally we feel a parsonage should have a mistress  --  " she began.  | " But not that a parson should . Heh-heh-heh , " I put in . " But go on . " "  --  and a man a wife . We 've taken a kind of , well , interest in you , yes . Up to now . " " But would n't you feel that  --  I mean under the circumstances  --  ? " I began haltingly . " It 's been a year now , or soon will be , " one of the others said , " and that 's enough . " I picked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one . " Whom did you have in mind , if I may ask . I gather from all this huggermugger that you 've had specific ideas ? " I said . " Oh , well , now I think this is really . . . " Mrs. Krakauer murmured . " There 's no point in being coy about it at this stage , " I said . " A minister is public property , I suppose , so you need have no feeling about making his business yours . Go on , tell me . I 'm curious . " They looked at one another , each declining the role of ultimate spokesman , but itching to hear another undertake it . Mrs. Comstock spoke up . " He 's right . It ca n't do any harm now  --  now that it ca n't do any good either , " she said . They raised their eyes to the ceiling , where Hester 's footsteps could be heard going from one room to another upstairs . Mrs. Comstock lowered her voice . " We all like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she 's fit in so beautifully in both the Players and on committee  --  and incidentally she regretted she could n't make it tonight . We think she 's a jewel . " Mrs. Comstock hunched her shoulders and exhaled sharply . " But what 's the use talking about it ? The Coker ! She could n't possibly have anything to do with you now . "  |p161I  SAT on the floor with my eye to the keyhole , looking into the vestibule where Hester was admitting Molly . I was secreted in the room in which I had received Mrs. Calico , the door of which ( closed now , of course ) commanded a view across the entrance hall into the living room . Molly had done her " work " at home that day and was deliveringthe " finished " typescripts to the rectory . Both women thought I was out , a belief of which I was taking advantage by doing a little much-needed eavesdropping . Rather at sea as to both women , I thought that if I could overhear them talking about me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain some clue as to how I stood and how I might best act in the widening crisis . So I sat squinting through the keyhole with a hardboiled egg in one hand and a glass of beer in the other , which was proof enough of herd tyrannies . Hester went by my line of vision to answer the door , humming " The Spanish Cavalier . " I took a quick pull on the cold beer and a bite of the egg , snapping my teeth around it and emitting a low growl . The women greeted one another by first names . " He 's at that meeting in the city hall , " Hester explained . " With the Chamber of Commerce . "  | " Oh , yes . Quite a mess all around . " " House is a mess too . " Hester laughed apologetically . " I have n't had a minute all day . Hope you wo n't think I 'm a sloppy housekeeper . " Molly started into the living room , but in the doorway to it she froze in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what lay in her path . Articles of my clothing were strewn everywhere . My coat lay on a chair , vest on another . My tie was on the piano , an end of it dangling into the works . My hat was hung on an ornamental metal spear on which the window drapes were hooked back . There would be cigarette dung on the carpets and a shoe , as I remembered it , kicked into a corner . A sticky Old-fashioned glass stood on a stack of sheet music , leaving its rings as planned . Molly let out such a gasp she could only go on and say , " My God ! Is he always like this ? " Hester laughed charitably . " Men are all alike . Each with his own individual quirks and crotchets to be put up with . Place does look like a cyclone struck it though , does n't it ? " She plucked a copy of Time hospitably from under Molly as Molly sat down . " There is n't much to discuss in these . " Molly flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A couple of spots where I could n't make out changes he penciled in . One place I do n't know whether he means the American Army is woefully uninformed or woefully uniformed . You do n't know when he 'll be back ? " " He 's not the soul of punctuality . " I-Iester was down on one knee digging the other shoe out from under an ottomanwith patient grunts . She heaved a sigh as she rose and drew a hand across her brow . Really ! I thought , setting my repast aside . It was Molly I moved to keep in view throughp163the keyhole , getting on all fours to do so . Molly watched Hester gather up the sea-wrack mentioned , plus a pair of socks I had discarded in an ashtray . I had gone too far . My one chance now was that , like the Russian people for whose benefit political confessions are exaggerated in hopes that they will recognize the burlesque , Molly would see this was not like me , and smile . " He throws his coat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . " It 's a good thing he does n't undressthere . " " Yes , it is . " Hester stood picking the knot out of the tie . She paused to wipe a stain from the piano top with the hem of her apron . She started out of the room with her arms full and my hat on her head . " Wait . " Molly turned in her chair . " The drinking . Had you no inkling of that ? " I withdrew my eye from the keyhole and put my ear to it . " It 's not up to us to judge , " Hester said . " So you 've heard about that too ? Well , do n't believe all you hear , and remember that alcohol is a refuge which people like that seek from their problems , which God knows Andrew has plenty of . " " Yes . And now Knopf rejecting his book . " " He did ? Oh , dear . " Hester appraised the sea-wrack with new eyes ; almost with Molly 's . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole human betrayal , and howled like the dog I was reduced to , mentally . " What did Knopf say ? " " Knopf seems to think it 's a collection of sermons , or rather Andrew seems to forget that it is . Knopf wrote a very cute letter saying it 's the same with every kind of collection , even short stories  --  you 're better off taking one up than gettingone out . Unless you 're Norman Vincent Peale . " I finished the egg and beer and left . I slid open a windowp164and backed out onto the porch , seething . This was no conditionin which to go to the meeting , but there was no time to cool off ; I was due there at eight and it was twenty to now . Nor was my frame of mind improved by the notice I read on the bulletin board in front of the city hall . It was typewrittenon official mayoralty stationery and read , more or less in the form of a proclamation : Effective tomorrow , there will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common across the street and making a wish in memory of Ida May Mackerel , this wish to be in keeping with her known ideals . This charming custom will itself be in accord with an observation once made by Mrs. Mackerelherself , who according to legend observed on that very spot that if there were more well wishers ( that is , people wishing others well ) the world would be more well and less sick than it is now . The old wishingwell will be regularly cleaned out and the proceeds to go for maintenance of the fountain in her name to be erected soon . My teeth aching , I went on in . The meeting was to be held in the council room on the third floor , and on the way to it I passed the office on the second where I had met Molly . I paused in the corridor and looked into the darkened room through the glass-topped door . I stood there letting melancholy roll over me like a breaker . I tried the knob , expecting to find the door closed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slipped in and shut the door behind me . In the faint light falling in from the end of the corridor I could see the desk where I had caught sight of the Parringtonbook , her old chair , the bench on which I had first awaited her . Being a few minutes early , I stretched out on it ,  |p165with  my feet on the wooden arm . It was a deacon 's bench , of course , a period piece . There 'll always be a New England ! Distantly I could hear arriving footsteps , a-muffled laugh ; overhead , vague voices . It was peaceful in here . I closed my eyes . I fished two pennies out of my pocket and laid one on each eye . Now it was over . Now I was dead and done with it . The farce was played out . I thought of Knopf , not without a certain compassion . He was apparently no longer to be taken seriously as a publisher . They would soon be taking up a collection for him at this rate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society , he had further written , but can not feel it is the all-devouringMoloch you make it out , nor that martyrs must still be regularly popped into its mouth to keep it happy . Perhaps you have some private , emotional reason for your stress of this point ? I guess what I am trying to say is that you have overstated the case . You have driven the nail clear through the plank and out the other side .. . Ca n't feel it , Knopf ? Ca n't feel the myth is society 's universaldragon-pet who must be fed its regular diet of victims ? Well , the footsteps are gathering overhead this minute , for the sacrifice , Knopf . It is the cabal convening , the conservativeinterests in full cry for the blood of one who dared to make a stand against them . Come along , Knopf , and we will see how the tribe operates in this supposedly sophisticated community along the eastern seaboard in the second half of the so-called twentieth century ( as the old lady said ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you slightly ; you have had correspondence with him . He has kicked against the pricks , and now it is turnabout : they will kick against him . Arise , Knopf , let us go hence . The council chamber is a room forty feet wide , in whichp166the mayor and ten selectmen hold their official sessions . Mayor Junior was to have charge of proceedings tonight and already sat at the head of the long conference table in one of those black , high-backed leather swivel chairs , studded with buttons like navels , nursing a gavel . Strewn at his feet were members of the Chamber of Commerce and the businessmeninterested in the Plaza , categories which greatly blended . Along one end of the room is a visitors ' gallery with about forty or fifty seats . A handful of them were occupied by slouching spectators , who twitched tentatively when I strode in . Turnbull was among them , and likewise Comstock , covering the meeting for the Globe . " Oh , Andy , " said Mayor Junior , rising to shake my hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisply , declining his outslung arm , determined to have no soft soap but a clean fight . They would not embrace me in order to crush me . I sat down at the table behind a name plate which read " Melvin Pryzalski . " " I think we can make this brief and friendly , " the mayor began . " My friend Andy here has taken exception  --  perfectlywithin his democratic right  --  to some aspects of the Plaza thing . We know what some of them are , but in case he has others , let 's hear him out so we can whomp out a little agreement among us that will be satisfactory to all and leave no hard feelings with anybody . The main thing will be to separate the esplanade from the shopping center , to which I think we can all agree . However , if Andy  --  I 'm sure he 's that to all of us  --  has something further , why we can add that to the little agreement I 've drawn up , sign it and get home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's got Gina Lollobrigidaon tonight . " I saw what I was up against . The mayor was a numskull apparently without any sense of his role as a diehard reaction/ary . The smiles of the rest indicated a conciliatory attitude that also augured poorly for an open conflict , with battle lines clearly drawn and blood spilt where it must . " We 'll do anything you want , " Sponsible was saying , " within reason . " Good Lord ! Evidently I must instruct them in the rudiments of their own skulduggery if this thing was to be guided on classic lines , or anything like them . Very well , I would needle them into a proper assumption of their parts . " Not so fast , boys , " I said , rising . " Let 's not muddle the issues with pretended sweetness and light . Society as it is constitutedleaves no room for compromise with those playing the power game and those daring to say them nay . The strugglebetween them is total , and admits of only one result  --  a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewildered shrugs . Their comprehension of the factors involved was more elementarythan I had imagined . I must begin with the simplestfundamentals . " Social elements thus in opposition , " I continued , " enact dramatico-metaphoric embodiments of tribal drives which are at the same time religious in nature . When the economic interests of those in power  --  now get this  --  when they congealwith their emotional ones , we have the complete myth in a given culture . This myth operates on all levels and against all opposition , because that opposition challenges both the pocketbook and the prejudice . The Mackerel Plaza is an example of such a myth in our time and in our place because it satisfies all those requirements . It unites your materialwith your instinctual interests , and having embraced it as sacrosanct , you will defend it with every resource at your command . " " We will ? " the mayor said , screwing his face up . I nodded . " You will stop at nothing . It is an inevitablep168part of the power pattern . " I paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around at his colleagues again for help . He was clearly out of his depth . A man on his right spoke up . " But we just said we 're perfectly willing to sit down with you and  --  " " Ah , ah . Cards on the table , gentlemen , please . We dispensewith token displays of amity and strike straight for the essentials . No mealy-mouthed equivocation and transparent subterfuge . " A man whom I recognized as Scanlon the paving contractorscratched his head . " But , gee , we think you 're a nice guy and . . . " " It 's no use . Compromise is impossible . It 's you against me . One of us must go down in defeat . Already the fire crackles and the idol yawns , but I warn you , gentlemen . Truth crushed to earth will rise again , and the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church ! " The mayor crooked his finger at his neighbor and bent his head toward him . Others did the same , frowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting all alone at the end of the table turned a pair of sad , chocolate eyes on me and said , " You do n't have to bully us . We 're only doing our best . " " I 'm not trying to bully you , " I said . " I 'm only trying to bring to a head the inevitable . There 's no point in wasting time in amenities that are doomed to failure . Let 's have done with the politics and declare the war ! " He lowered his eyes meekly and resumed picking at a crack in the veneer of the table top . It was Kerfoot , the electrical engineer and lickspittle , who had been present at the luncheonwhere all this had been hatched . Others seemed equally cowed . Presently he turned to old Meesum on his right andp169some distance down the table . Meesum had been making circles on a pad with the expression of a man who resents being smoked out . Finally he dropped his pencil and leaned toward a group which included his mayor son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beehive . Are you watching , Knopf ? Are you getting all this ? They have their heads together , and their voices as they speak are as the sound of knives being whetted , and as wind in savage grass . " Are there any other questions ? " I asked . " Before we get on with it ? " A stocky man in a gray suit got up . It was Sponsible , the head of the excavating firm . He was a self-made man in the sense that he had himself once driven the bulldozers now operatedfor him by others . He had just returned from a sunny two weeks in Florida , and his face looked like a burnt pan . There are people whose very appearance bespeaks their line of work , and there was about Hugh Sponsible 's knobbed hands and his figure and even his voice a loose , hard , easyrattlingsomething that seemed to say we are not dust but gravel . " You say we 're supposed to railroad you on all them levels . " " That is correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Could you give us a few pointers ? " " Certainly . You will do it first through your ownership of the mass media : the press , radio and television , the mouths of old women . You will engage in attacks both on my intellectualposition and my character . The latter has already begun . All this will be aimed toward your final coup  --  the attempted removal of my means of livelihood . " Sponsible nodded , stroking his nose , in perfect willingnessp170to accept instruction in his role as oppressor but still retainingcertain doubts to be aired . " Ca n't we live and let live ? " " No . That is against your nature . Individually , yes ; collectively , no . There your instinct is to protect the cash nexus of society , as Karl Marx has called it . " Sponsible sat down and a hand went up at the other end of the table . " Yes ? " I said . It was Scanlon again . " I 'm a simple man without much knowledge of these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " But about this myth business . I do n't quite get that . How we use that to make a buck and so on . Could you explain that a little more ? " " I 'm glad you asked that question , " I said . Now we were coming to grips . " I 'll give you an example of how you 're working it . The first thing you , the reigning oligarchy , do is popularize a utilizable figure , but in order to elevate it for the greatest number you vulgarize it . Just before coming here I read the announcement on the bulletin board about this wishing well twaddle . " The mayor stirred in his chair and a small fidget ran along other parts of the table . " This is real mythology , boys . " " Why ? " said the mayor . " Why ? Because Mrs. Mackerel had a mind like a steel trap , an antiseptic , sardonic , modern mind . One of often surgically cruel precision . She could never in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preposterous thing like that . " Wounded anger replaced the mayor 's air of simple confusion . " I do n't understand what you mean , " he said . " What 's sappy about that story ? I think it 's nice . "  | " If you do n't know , I ca n't explain it to you . ' Where did you hear such a thing ? " " Why , I found it in a publicity release . I . , .. do n't see our press agent here . . . " " You see ? " I shot at Sponsible . " Press agents making up little legends fit for mass consumption . And that effective tomorrow ' bit . ' Who 's gem was that ? " " Mine , " said the mayor resentfully . " What 's wrong with that ? Does n't every tradition have to get started sometime ? " " That 's right , " I said with a smile . " Ida May used to say , One dreams of the goddess Fame and winds up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know shook his finger across the table at me . " I do n't think she used language like that and I do n't think you ought to use it here ! " he said . " And calling her cruel , " Scanlon said to him . " That story illustrates a fine little sentiment and I think it 's true . " The hubbub grew in volume , supported by exchanged nods . The gallery loungers were now galvanized into quite erect positions . Charlie Comstock 's pencil galloped . Turnbullkneaded his mustache excitedly . As Junior banged his gavel I surveyed the scene with an inward smile . The caldronwas boiling briskly . Who could doubt my thesis now ? Junior was rapping for silence for his old pa , who had signaled for the floor . They were all glad to see the old fox rise and take it : he would represent them well . " This memorial is close to the heart of all of us , " he began , laying his hand on his heart , where his wallet palpably bulged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of putting the cards on the table . But let 's do one more thing . Let 's turn them face up . " He paused to let this sink in , greeting it himself . with a burst of unrequited laughter.  | " Let 's ask for his motives in all this . Let 's ask whether he 's opposed to just this bandwagon , this trough in which he says we 've all got our snouts , or to private profit as such . " Swell . " I 'm opposed to cracking open to commercial exploitationthe last smidgen of scenic beauty left in this damned town . You got your way by befuddling a philanthropist into parting with more then he intended . " " Where shall we expand then , man ! " " What do I care ? " " Do you realize how dense the population of this town is ? " " I have inklings , " I said , looking him steadily in the eye . " You quoted Karl Marx . Are you a Communist ? " All gall is divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is the basic glandular structure from which the trait derives its name ; second , the nervous make-up and shadings of temperament which result in the gift of aggression ; and lastly a certain density of mind which blinds the character to the resentment he inspires in others . Meesum had all these requirements in an unabridged degree , and that was why he struck everybody , and not just me , as the brassiest man they ever met . One or two , including Spracklingthe young lawyer who had slipped in late , laughed . Most of them , even those whom I had goaded into a sense of their function as oppressors , looked to me to answer this absurd question with a loud negative. 1 was not going to let them off so easy . I must lure them on to a full measure of accusation , to drive home to them the depth of their complicity in this enterprise . Guilt by association turned around . They must see that they were equally yoked with their spokesman in a cabal against me.  | " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I answered evasively . ( They did n't have anything to share , but I must give Meesum enough rope . ) Meesum grasped his lapels firmly in both hands , and I remembered its having been said that he had once had ecclesiastical ambitions . " Do you know how many sheep Abraham had ? " " Abraham who ? " " Abraham of old . How many cattle ? How many acres of land ? He was a very rich man . " " Not as a result of private initiative . I understood he got it all from God . " This was a barb that really went home . Nothing could more have incited Meesum , who had inherited everything he himself owned . " I 'm glad to hear you mention God , " he said . " You do it little enough in church . You said once in a sermon that the common people must have loved gods , they made so many of them . Do you think that was respectful ? " " Of whom , Lincoln or God ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though in his rage he had only himself to cling to for support . I suspected what was eating him especially these days . He had tried to settle the division , created in his mind by the conflicting genealogical societies as to his ancestry , by retaining a third , which claimed to have uncovered Moorish origins totally absent from the reports of the other two . This had unnerved him further and shortened his temperacutely . " It is rumored that on Saturday nights you go about hecklingstreet corner evangelists , " he said . " Is that true ? " " I have often heckled them , yes . " " Is that conduct befitting a minister of the Gospel ? "  | " I feel it my duty to oppose vulgarity in any form . Such men are to religion what jingoism is to patriotism . " " Hear ! hear ! " shouted a voice in the gallery . It was a bull-necked man in a red mackinaw . " National sovereignty must go ! Only world government will save us ! " Junior rapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had let him finish his piece , to point up the type who might be expected to rally to my banner . Old Meesum improved the occasion by consulting some notes he had taken from his pocket . Evidently he had come prepared for this crossquestioning . " You also once said  --  correct me if I misquote you  --  It is the final proof of God 's omnipotence that he need not exist in order to save us . ' " I acknowledged the accuracy of the quotation with a nod . " Does n't that sound a lot like Voltaire ? " " Voltaire said something quite different . You 're probably thinking of his aphorism , If there were no God , it would be necessary to invent him . ' I go beyond that . I take the final step whereby theology , annihilating itself , sets religion free . " " Oh , you think you 're smarter than Voltaire . " " Why , are you a fan of his ? " Meesum raised his cards above his head and slammed them down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue with a man who wo n't stick to the point ! " he said , and sat down with almost as violent a contact with his chair as the cards had had with the table . There was another silence . Mayor Junior looked miserablyaround . They looked at me with reproving , hangdog glances . The meeting seemed to have foundered . " Why did n't you bring all this up at the luncheon at the Stilton that time ? " the mayor asked . " You were there . "  | " I did n't know at the time that it would take on this mythos-ethos opposition , " I said . " How could I know that then ? " - Sponsible raised his hand again and said a few words . " Well , I just want to say that I appreciate Reverend Mackerel 's objections . About the Plaza , the way it was gone at , " he remarked . " But that 's natural in a big enterprise . Mistakes will be made , excesses be guilty of . Sure it 's a splash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember on as big a scale as possible somebody who gave herself on as big a scale as possible ? After all , did n't she make the supreme sacrifice ? " He sat down to a round of applause and pats on the back . This was the moment , for me . He had stated the specific myth . It was up to me whether I was going to let it pass , or challenge it . Speak now or forever hold your peace . Are you ready , Prometheus ? I had an idea . Maybe I could get across by indirection what I had never been able to blurt out directly . Did n't I owe to Turnbull , even more than to them , this deliverance from the marshes of myth to the dry land of reality ? I could put them one step from the truth , and let them take the last one by inference . " Yes , I have always thought her deed a noble one , " I said . " All the more so because she could n't swim a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute silence . In it , you could sense speculation like a soundless seething going on all around you . They seemed suspended in a vacuum for a moment . Then one of the heads turned slowly to Sprackling . Then another , then a third . They were making inferences all right . Sprackling rose . He had come really only to relinquish his legal duties for the Plaza , having just been appointed anp176assistant prosecuting attorney , and had not expected to participate on these lines . " If the late Mrs. Mackerel could n't swim , " he said , " how was it you could run the risk of taking her out in a canoe ? " I followed the trajectory of this notion with a kind of dreamy detachment , turning my head in a looping glance to the left , as if in pursuit of an object describing an arc . " Risk ? " I said , driving the word through a bung in my throat . " Yes . I should consider it so . Canoes tip over . " " Now you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Now you 're getting the hang of it . This is what I meant . Well might you ask , To what green altar , 0 mysterious priest , lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies ? ' Might it not be , my lord , the altar of Mammon himself ? " " I should like to remind you that this is a serious hearing , despite its apparent informality , and not an exercise in this Machiavellian mumbo jumbo you seem to have on the brain , " Sprackling said . " Now , I was asking you if it was n't dangerous to go out in a canoe under the circumstances . They tip over . " " It never would have if she had n't stood up and rocked it , which in turn would n't have happened if the crisis had n't arisen that did . So from that point of view she did give her life for another , and the monument is in perfect order , " I said . " Well then . Does that bring the questions to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an evening and get on to Ed Murrow  --  " " Not so fast , " Sprackling said . " Aspects of this thing do arouse one 's curiosity , which I hope you do n't mind satisfying . Whose idea was it to go out in a canoe  --  rather than rent one of the numerous rowboats available ? "  | " Oh , hers . I was against it at first , my lord , but she won me over . We had quite an argument about it , but she won me over . She always won the arguments . Everything in order there , eh , my lord ? " I spoke , despite the witticism , with my head somewhat atilt and with that high assurance that distinguishes the true martyr from the sullen scapegoat . The vocative was a kind of arm offered to help them up a step onto this higher plane , too , while also supplying a dash of irony we all needed , a bit of the garlic of parody rubbed on the strong meat of these proceedings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps ? " I executed a series of gestures in the air in front of me , as though directing traffic of great size and complexity . " Happinessis no laughing matter , as the Irishman said . " At this point a minor disturbance broke out in the gallery . Some , including the internationalist who had been furtively distributing pamphlets on behalf of his own cause , began debating the propriety of this line of questioning , and their words became a free-for-all which also divided the committee around the table . " You have no right to ask him things like that here , " one of my defenders called out . " Wait till you get him in court . " The commotion subsided when Turnbull 's tall figure rose in the front of the gallery . He asked for the floor and got it . " I think it 's time I spoke up here , " he said . " Andy Mackerel is my friend and so was Ida May . I 'm not as embarrassed by this as you might think . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way she died does n't make that much difference . But it does for Andrew'speace of mind and future welfare in this community . So we ought to go into the facts of that accident a littlep178more fully for his sake , and settle them if we can . Now can anybody shed any light on it ? " In the silence their expressions asked him what he meant . " I mean there must have been eye witnesses to the event . On that crowded beach . You were all there , " he said , spreading his rangy arms . " You were all eye witnesses to the scene in general . But did anybody see that particular part of what happened in the cove ? " Another silence followed this query . It lasted fifteen seconds , half a minute . No one volunteered . " I guess that 's that then , " Turnbull said . " Obviously I ca n't settle it . I was bobbing around on an inner tube . " A small figure rose behind him and spoke up in a highpitched voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know if this 'll be any help , " he said , " but there was somebody there who was taking pictures from the dock at the time . Movies , I mean . It was Waldo Hale . He had that movie camera of his along and started shooting when the motor launch got loose . That was all fun , of course , and he got some footage of it , but then the other happened . That was probably in it , so his mother said he had n't ought a have the reel developed . In fact she wanted him to burn it , I remember . Whether he did or not , or ever got it developed , I ca n't say . I do n't know . " Sprackling , who had momentarily sat down , rose again , fingering his Phi Beta Kappa key . " Is Waldo Hale here ? " he asked . " No , " said the Shively youth , " and he ai n't in town either . IIe 's in the Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hale ? " " His mother passed away last fall , sir . Neither of his parents is alive and the house is shut up . Waldo and I ex/change letters once in a while , so maybe I could write to him and ask him about the film . I mean if I could be of any ... " " That wo n't be necessary , " said Sprackling , hurriedly gathering up some papers and thrusting them into his briefcase . " We 'll telephone Fort Bliss tonight . "  |p180WELL  , they think I killed her . " Hester had been waiting up for me in the living room , to hear how the meeting had gone . I set aside the dregs of the drink whose consumption had attended my narrative of the events of the night . I spoke as one relishing a hardearnedvindication while giving another his just desserts . " They think I took advantage of the confusion to tip the canoe over , see . Something along that line . They 'll never find the pictures and I 'll live out the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Escanaba , Michigan , or in Athens , either Georgia or Greece , it makes no difference which , becauseeverywhere I go the story 'll catch up with me  --  or they 'll find the pictures and there 'll be some fluke in the photography that looks funny and I 'll end up with a rope around my neck . I hope you 're satisfied now . You 've had this coming to you for some time . " Hester was doing her needle point . She drew a thread through and reached for a highball she had asked me to fix her . She drank half of it like one quenching a literal thirst rather than imbibing liquor . " You romanticize things , " she declared . " I warn you not to nag . Persecutions , slander , **26;11334;TOOLONG , and , finally , death by execution I do n't mind  --  they 're part of the game . I expect them . But henpecking I will not have .

Good , I 'll make a date for you . " " Not me , Andrew  --  you . " She drew a deep breath and held it for a prolonged interval in her lungs , as though she had momentarily forgotten what to do with air . She let it out with the same careful study of me with which she had taken it in . " The way you think people are after you and all , it alarms me . I do n't mean you should go off to him in a panic and settle down to a long siege of treatments  --  I do n't mean that . I only say this to show you that I 'm worried . " " I wish I was dead and out of it , " I said listlessly , to the wall . " I want to lie beside the ever-murmuring sea , on the hot sand , till all the flesh is bleached from my bones , and I can rest in peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oven . " " What good will that do ? The stove is electric . " I must pull myself together , I thought , pouring myself a stiffer drink than usual . I padded back to the chair in stockingfeet , for I had removed my shoes , which were tight . After sitting down , I tapped the arm of the chair with a forefinger . " I 've spent a lifetime hacking out a coherent position , and I say they 're out to get me . I 'll stake my professionalreputation on that . " She coughed into her fist and asked , " As an anthropologist , Andrew ? " " It ca n't be anything else . It fits . It 's got to . It 's just the way things are . "  | " You 've got a theory and you 'll prove it if it kills you . Is that it ? " I wedged my feet back into my shoes and rose without lacing them . I was going to bed . The metallic tips of the laces tinkled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my drink . " I 'll tell you this , young lady . You read the papers tomorrow , and I 'll bet my bottom dollarthe whole story will be slanted their way . The hunt is on ! " " Andrew , do you ever have feelings that people are followingyou ? " " I 'm not going to stay here and listen to crazy talk . " I started on up . " Wait . " I paused halfway up the stairs . Her tone was an argumentative version of serenity . " When I was a little girl , we had a wonderful aunt . She lived in Seekonk , did this aunt , " she went on , plying her needle and thread , " and we loved to visit her because she had nine children of her own .

" I settled down in bed with a book . I read a page and let it drop . Knopf had been asked to resign by his board ofp183directors , who , as individuals , however , got together a small purse to help set him up in a bookstore , to see if maybe he could n't do a little better on that end of the production of literature . But the same lack of judgment that had vitiated his choice of unpublished manuscripts vexed his selection of published , and that venture failed too .

The third ring was answered by Tabitha Twitchet , past whom I got by asking for her precious daughter in a voice imitating Robert Morley . Twitching my mouth and sniffing , I said , " Is Molly theah-ahm ? " Through Molly 's own dramatically hissed protests , when I identified myself , I said , " I thought you might care to know how the meeting turned out . " " Yes , I 've been meaning to call you . How did it ? " " Why , they 're circling for the kill , " I said , picking up the phone from the table and setting it on my stomach . " All according to pattern . Look , can you meet me in Chickenfoottomorrow night ? I 've got to talk to you . " The next day would be Saturday , so we would n't meet at the office . " Yes . As a matter of fact that 's what I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you . " " That you love me ? " " Fine , Hilary . I 'll meet you there then . " " Good . Shall we say eightish , at that place next to the tannery that says Eats ' ? " My fork struck an object in the hash which seemed immune to penetration . This left only the alternatives of circumvention or removal . I poured large gouts of ketchup on the hash , muddled the result together and shoved the plate to one side . Molly did the same with her hamburger ,  |p184remarking  , " I 've always been a good judge of horseflesh and this is horseflesh . " I ordered ice cream for both of us , and coffee . A sign on the wall advertised their " bottomless cup , " which meant you could ask for all the refills you wanted ; a managerial risk which became clear the instant you tasted the stuff . The ice cream was full of rock salt . " Andy ? " said Molly , stirring her coffee and addressing a point in space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much secretarial stuff for one girl to handle . And now with these long letters you 're writing to Knopf . I mean it 's too much . " " Of course . I 'll look for an extra girl the first thing next week . P.L. is growing , is n't it ? " She sucked thoughtfully on a spoonful of ice cream . " So we lose our little haven , " she said . " Somebody else in the office there with us . " " Yes . " " That being the case , there 's no point in my staying on . So you might as well get two new girls right away . " I saw the whole farce being dismantled and reconstructedin reverse : Molly would quit . Then she would quit being seen with me . Then she would quit going to P.L. and go back to M.E.  --  or become one of those millions of unfortunate Americans with no spiritual affiliations . " What a time we do have of it , " I said , " but of course it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chickenfoot , places like this , the night we spent at the Coker . " I reached for her hand . " Oh , my dearest , we did n't spend that night  --  we put it in the bank . " She had both her hands in her lap , where her bag was . She reached into it and I caught a wink of something glittering . " In the bank of our love , our future , our faith in one an/other . . . Molly , what is this you seem to be giving me ? " " I ca n't wear it anyway , so you 'd better keep it till  --  and  --  well , I might lose it . " I put the ring in my pocket . I took a suck of my own ice cream , and a sip of my coffee . " We must meet again sometime , " she said . " Fine . Shall we say lunch a year from Tuesday ? " She sat stiffly with bowed head , about to burst into something , whether tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dog and that my ears hung in my food , as an alternative to throwing back my head and baying like one . Lifting my cup to drink my coffee I noticed what I seemed to have the previous time , a hot trickle of sorts onto the knee of my trousers . It was the beverage all right , dribblingthrough a leak in the vessel . " Is this your bottomless cup then , woman ? " I said to the waitress . " Is that what the term means ? " " Please do n't be angry with me , " Molly said . " You  --  I  --  it 's all so impossible . Not just the original situation but what 's arising out of it . No , not what 's arising out of it so much as what you 're determined shall arise out of it . It 's going to fit your theories or bust . " " Will you please explain what you 're talking about ? " " This hearing and all  --  I heard about it today from somebody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd act the way they were supposed to . Now there 's nothing about it in the Bridgeport papers today and you 're sore about that . So you 'll pull out another stop . " " Putting the squeeze on the editorial department through the advertising takes time , as you may know . " " Oh , nuts ! I know what 's happening . This book and all that 's at stake in it is now the main thing  --  not our love affair . It 's your male type all over . "  |p186I  broke in two a cookie that accompanied the ice cream , and poked a piece of it into my mouth . " You might say you 're egging them on just to show Knopf up . It 's as bad as that . You 've really forgotten me  --  or it 's taken second place . Knopf is now your number one target . You 'll prove he 's wrong and your damn book is right if it kills you . There was nothing in any of the papers this afternoon and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I drew a careful breath to avoid inhaling any of the cookie I had suspended chewing , and turned and shook my head like a man who has only himself to consult with . " It 's true , " she said , lowering her voice but speaking with increasing fire . " Oh , Jesus , you intellectuals , " she said , clenching a fist and rolling the expletive toward the ceiling . " It 's the story of my life . " " Perhaps you have a thesis of your own to prove ? " I answeredquietly . " You 're damned right I have , " she said across the table , in a compressed whisper that made her words reach me like a kind of lethal gas . " All this maturity stuff is fine , but there are two kinds , mental and emotional , and you rarely get the two in one guy . In fact the more you get of the one the less you get of the other . Maybe nature just has n't got enough to go around , specialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et cetera . Anyhow , so we get the adult books and the adult paintings and the adult movies all turned out by spoiled children . Look , Ma , I wrote an adult book . " Hey , kids , look at the adult drama I wrote . ' Oh , brother , can I pick ' em ! " she went on through clenched teeth , her two bunched fists in the air before her as though she were leadingthe rooting section in a much-needed cheer . " The first one paints unicorns with adult flies on them . The second'sp187occupation is eating strawberries with Harold in Italy ' going , while secreting three sentences a day on a biography of Berlioz . Then another long-hair who 's bald-beaded on top of it , and then came Analysis with his trench coat , and then , oh , what 's the use . And now the prize of the lot  --  be wants to put his neck in a noose to spite Knopf . " " How about Todarescu ? " I said , swallowing the last of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and your infinite weariness , and your cultural patterns and your Voltaires and your Rimbauds and recurring symbols in Faulkner and now it 's Dylan Thomas . Oh you intellectuals , " she cried again , " smoking your literary cornsilk behind the barn of  --  of  --  I do n't know what , " she said , letting the metaphor collapse . " Todarescu ? He 's got something lined up for the summer , a directing job in Florida , working tents and one-night stands and so on with a variety show . They 're trying to get New Faces material , but anyhow it 'll be a variety bill . Sort of a revue . He can get me lined up for a part in it . " " So it 's Todarescu who picks up the marbles . Is that it ? " " This will be strictly professional . " " Mm , plim-plam-plom , " I laughed , imitating Todarescu . " That 's rich . You and him in Florida on a strictly plamplom-plim . In tents . Oh , plim-plom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want to get into a fight about this , Andy . The theater 's in my blood , and it 's none too early to think about the summer road . You do n't seem to want to part friends , so maybe I 'll just leave you here  --  rise quietly and go . No , Andy . No fuss , no tears , no regrets . You 're really very sweet , but I just ca n't take any more . It 's best this way . Good-by and good luck . " " Wait . " I stayed her at the table , standing . " Would itp188make any difference if we left Avalon and made a fresh start somewhere else ? Because I have an offer from a church in Bridgeport . They 'll give me five thousand a year , the house , of course , free light and heat , and a scooter ... Well , think it over . Do n't give me your answer now . " One of the troubles with this middle ear business is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , indistinguishable from hunger pangs . The only way to find out which it is is to eat something , and then it 's too late . After walking around alone a bit , I made for a place that was a combination bar and grill , a mile or so from where Molly and I had so sketchily dined . I walked at the edge of the sidewalk , finally with one foot in the gutter and the other on the curb , like a cripple with one leg longer than the other . How much more evidence was needed that elements in question were driving me out of my mind ? I hobbled along experimentally for a block or two in this fashion , thinking about the scene with Molly and what things were coming to . Todarescu had a way of scratching his head gingerly so as not to disturb the part in his hair . Had she noticed that ? This Bridgeport parish , would they have a theatrical director there ? No , I would be expected to handle the dramatics myself , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregation up in sheets and shoving them out onstage to yell , " Barabbas ! Barabbas ! Release unto us Barabbas ! " The bar and grill was on the other side of the street and I crossed over . There were four or five tables , two of them occupied . I went to the counter . It was littered with crumbs of food . A waitress with a cloth came over and flicked them onto the stools . I brushed one clean and sat down . Thep189waitress , a plump , pleasant-looking girl in a starched green uniform , drew me a glass of water . " What 'll you have ? " she asked , and left . I caught a glance at myself in a mirror behind the coffee urn and dishes . Just over a stack of reflected plates , I saw my face . My upper lip was drawn taut , exposing my teeth , and one nostril was curled in a snarl . My God , what were they doing to me ! How much proof was needed ? I turned away , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptibly and the snarl became audible , as I hunched safeguardingly over my water . What could more clearly indicate that they were unseating my reason ? I thought a moment , chin in hand and ticking my fingers along my brow , as though I might as well tap that as the counter  --  might as well drum that . The waitress returned with pad and pencil poised . " Give me a piece of apple pie with cheese , and a glass of beer , " I said . " Beer with pie ? " she said . " No , with the cheese , " I said . " What 's wrong with that ? " She shrugged and made a record of my wishes , then hove off to fulfill them . She drew a wedge of pie from a glass case and flipped it onto the kitchen wicket for the cheese ; then she went into the annex where the bar was , and I heard her say , " . . . he must be ... " And well she might . The more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one she saw , by whom she had , did she but know it , already been plucked and eaten . For here the pressures to which Mackerel was being so cruelly subjectedwere keenest , here was still the sorest crucible in which he was being tried . The stretch of continence to this length had grossly lowered his threshold , so that a not terribly attractive girl at a nearby table interfered with hisp190enjoyment of what turned out to be a surprisingly good piece of restaurant pastry . She was about twenty-five , and naked except for a green skirt and sweater , heavy brown tweed coat , shoes , stockings , and so forth , a scarf knotted at her throat and a brown beret . I regarded her breasts with melancholy , then my eyes began their ordained journey downward . A chink between the knees offered a gleam of white skin . " The secret where the stocking ends . " Spender ? Her companion , an older woman in a sweat shirt , was completely lackluster I noted with gratitude . I returned to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , pulpy pink mouth , which was parted in a rather moronic smile . She was saying to her friend , " Then he says to me , Get out . I never want to see you again . ' I says , Do n't be so possessive , telling me to get out , we 're through . Who are you trying to get possessive with ? It 's your main trouble . You ca n't tell me what to do . ' We had some more words , then he repeats , Get out . I never want to lay eyes on you again . ' I says , Listen , who do you think you 're taking for granted . . . ? ' " I gave a stir of delight . In thirty seconds the girl had drained herself of every charm . I could sit here and without ordeal contemplate the moist mouth , that . heartbreaking prow , those hemispheres which , when she rose to walk would  --  Listen to her talk . " So he says , We 're through . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just like that , imagine , out of a clear sky . He 'll make the decisions . I says , Listen , buddy boy , I 'll come and go as I please . You do n't own me . I 'm the master of my fate , you included .. ' I laughed to myself . I was off the hook . For this relief much thanks . I needed it . Because I did n't know how muchp191longer I could go on like this . The obstacles in my way were unfair . I was human and I was normal . I must have a woman . A woman who would envelop my . existence and befriend my spirit and leave her musk in my bed . The secret where the stocking ends . The flower where the fancy tends . The delta where the river wends . The garden where the hunger ends . Their thighs were like loaves of warm bread , their smell like that of warm bread .. . My daydreams ( which now went deep into the middle of the night ) were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visual ravings of thirst . They ran to erotic etudes and chimerical methods of pairing based on hearsay and the most extreme data , sequences in which at last I saw myself locked in complex and carnivorous postureswith women I had never seen before . I was in the country of those dark specialists in rumination who had left their phosphorescent print on a corner of nineteenthcenturyFrench literature ; beyond it lay those visions , penultimate to madness itself , that turned the brains of the saints into nests of maggots . The fruit of chastity : the Temptations of Saint Anthony . As I paid and rose to leave , I was put into a fresh lather , alas , by a black-haired belted figure leaving the restaurant ahead of me . She was a mare of a girl , her loins like a swayingbell . This was serious . I knew that I must evict this creature from my mind if I was to have a wink of sleep . As she left , she called a good-by to the waitress that showed an intelligent casual poise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , banking on some apparent plethoraof chin to get me off the hook . Half a block down , as I was trying to scurry abreast of her to get a look , I bumped into another pedestrian . It was a woman carrying several bundles , which I knocked from her arms . I paused to helpp192her retrieve them , and as I thrust them apologetically back into her hands I recognized Mrs. Sponsible . She gave a gasp of surprise , and I hurried on , excusing myself . ' When I reached the corner of the street the girl was just boarding a bus . I stood there as the door closed behind her and it rumbled away through the Saturday night traffic . When I turned around , it was to see Mrs. Sponsible standingup the street where I had left her , watching me . Seeing me glance back , she turned and hurried off . I went into a bar and had two whiskies . Shouldering myself in beside a stocky red-faced man in a leather jacket , I said in a low voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gash in this town ? " He lowered a stein of beer to the bar and shrugged . " Ask any cabbie . You new here ? " " More or less . " " Well , there 's lots of places around here , though I personallywould n't know any addresses . But any cabbie can tell you . " I gulped down my drink and hurried into the street , breathing heavily . Were they satisfied with what they were driving me to now ? Was this the way I would end ? Denial by no means always resulted in the sublimation credited to it then , did it ? Often it worked the reverse . I thought of those animals that attack people and kick out the sides of their stalls until gelded . As I walked along , I encountered a pet peeve that drew from me more than its normal fire . A street-corner evangelist was swinging a Bible and shouting , " Jesus is the powerhouse ! Are you plugged in ? Jesus is the transformer ! Are you wired up ? Jesus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trolley on ? Oh , is your trolley on ? "  |p193My  teeth grated , and my fists worked in my pockets . It was not merely the humiliation of this imbecile 's being technically a colleague . It was n't just the vulgarity of the scene , though that was of a shattering kind . It was the spectacle of a faith and a form in which I had some belief being debauched into a yapping ritual for boosting paltry souls into heaven . These men were worse than infidels , for at least many infidels were Christians . The speaker must have detected the animation in my face , alone in the small group of sullen listeners who surroundedhim , and mistaken it for approval . He therefore turned on the box on which he was standing and said to me : " Brother , have you found Christ ? " " Is he lost again ? " I said . " Oh , brother , do n't mock , " he said , his face falling , but only for a moment , as he rallied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , I will not , " I said . " Oh , brother , why not ? Give me one good reason . Come on , I 'm waiting . So is he . " He pointed upward . " Do n't you see what nonsense all this is ? " I hit out aggressively . " Do n't you realize that the Gospels do n't harmonize ? That you ca n't use the Bible literally , that this railroad to heaven you think you 're running makes a farce of a noble ethic ? " " Do n't harmonize ? Do n't harmonize ! Oh , brother , " he said , slapping his brow with a gesture that converted the word from a vocative to an expletive . " He says the Gospels do n't harmonize . " " They do n't . Even Martin Luther admitted that , and suggestedwe get on with it , on to more important matters . When I say I wo n't take him I mean I wo n't on your terms.  |p194Where  did Cain get his wife ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible is literally true ? " There was no telling how the tide of battle might have gone between us , because I found myself involved with a new adversary . A drunk , or semi-drunk , from the other edge of the circle made his way around to me . He had been listening as phlegmatically as the rest to the evangelist , but took the opportunity to pick a fight with the heckler . " Lis'n , bud , " he said , swaying slightly , " do you know who you 're talking to ? Servant Lord . " " I 'm not talking to you in any case , " I said . " And now if you 'll please clear out of the way . " " And if I do n't , then what ? I suppose you 'll knock me ? " " I would n't be a bit surprised . " The drunk swung at me , missed and fell . That enraged him , and he got to his feet and came at me like a butting goat . I caught my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a heap . Before I knew what else was happening , I felt myself being collared and hauled to my feet by a burly cop . " Now , what 's this all about ? " he demanded , holding the drunk and myself face to face . A woman offered an analysis . " Well , he 's drunk and he was heckling the preacher , and he  --  " There were too many he 's . The cop could n't tell smiter from smitten or drunk from sober . Off we were packed to the station in a cruising squad car , which he summoned from a call box and which appeared in an instant . The officersover to whom we were delivered told us that they were under orders to clamp down on the spreading rowdyism in that part of Chickenfoot . There had been complaints , from civic groups , from the pulpit , from parent organizations , andp195the command was to run ' em in . Thus the original cop had much preferred chalking up an arrest to settling the disturbanceon the scene . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate cells . That done , however , the sergeant at the night desk relented . He had done his duty . He let me telephone home around one o'clock . I got Hester out of bed and she got Turnbull , and between the two of them they managed to bail me out in time to preach the next morning.  |p196WUXTRY  ! Wuxtry peebahs ! " Knopf was shoutingon a midtown Manhattan street corner . " Read all about it ! Offbeat minister nabbed in slaying . Pleads innocence but protests social guilt . Action corroborates prisoner 's theory . Read all about it ! Get your late editions here ! " I was stretched out fully clothed on my bed , at fifteen minutes till church . I had n't gotten home till nearly four , but not having slept , I was up and ready in time for divine worship . With a quarter-hour to spare , I lay down to composemy thoughts . I lay very straight . Presently I reached into my pocket for the two pennies and laid them on my eyes . I folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut down in his prime . So much yet to give , but done in by bungling hands , that flame snuffed with the candle not yet half consumed . What they did not understand was that he had no quarrel with the myth per se but only with its inevitable misuse by brutish men . They never understood his ministry , the meaning of his life : that he had come to call , not sinners , but the righteousto repentance . Too late now . Those lips were cold , the proud spirit flown . Now his house shall be removed from him , and his bishopric shall another take.  |p197There  was a soft tread in the hall and a rap on the door and Hester said , " Andrew ? " " I 'm dead . " - " I know . You 'll be able to rest after the service . I 'll see that nobody disturbs you . I 'm going along now and do n't you be too long . It 's only ten minutes . " I slipped my fingers under my shirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pennies , and as I put my legs over the side of the bed a sob caught in my throat , torn free by the spectacle of heroism in our time . Seeming to be digging vainly in my clothes for a handkerchief , I reached to a nearby writing desk and dried my tears with a blotter . So here was roughly how things stood with Mackerel in the public eye , I reviewed to myself as I walked over to the church building : He was an alcoholic , a lecher and a Red . His drinking was in the main solitary and had therefore not come to light before , but it was now a known and openly discussed fact . He sought his women in the disreputable quarters of Chickenfoot , where , in addition to chasing anything in skirts , he also undoubtedly frequented vice and gambling dens . He was a brawler . While indulging these graphic and assorted passions along those and God knew what other fronts , he had been going steady with a nice girl . The nice girl had found him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an engagement , hardly surprising under the circumstances . She was reportedly hysterical and being packed off out of the country , under a doctor 's care . Just how far back these habits of Mackerel 's extended was hard to say , but it was known that he had been " keeping company " rather soon after his wife 's death , and more than likely that he had been living this double life while she was still alive . A man who will cheat in the betrothed state willp198obviously not hesitate to do so in the married ! He had admitted that they had quarreled constantly , and the rumor was that he had beat her , no doubt on those roaring drunks  --  which no one now blamed her for having kept secret to her dying day . It was a natural thing for families to do  --  they had their pride . Poor woman , though , what she must have gone through . She had been more of a saint than they had dreamt ! And now here he was trying to queer the memorialout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder it turns out there seems something fishy about that so-called accident at the beach . You mean  --  ? Yes . The police are on the trail of something . It 's still hush-hush , but expected to break any hour . The instant I entered the church I saw how far my reputationhad fallen . The place was jammed . The worship area was not only full , it spilled over into the gymnasiumauditoriumpart from which it was divided by the accordion folding walls . P.L. had never packed in so many while I was a respected figure in the community and invited to dinner . Now that I was no longer received in proper society , they came from miles around to see and hear me . We dedicated a new liberalized hymnal that morning , and as the congregation raised their voices in the strains of " Funiculi-funicula " and " Has anybody here seen Kelly , K-edouble1-y , " I sat glancing through the text of my message . It was the last of the series on the Seven Churches in Asia , and luckily accommodated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , the hasty incorporation of which a slight mouse on one eye and a few cuts and bruises called for . " Our text for this morning , " I began when the extended " sing " was over and I had taken my place at the pulpit , " our text for this morning , dearly beloved , is from Revelationp199three , verses fourteen to sixteen , where we read : And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write . . . I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot . I would thou wert cold or hot . So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spew thee out of my mouth . ' " The first stir that had gone among the audience on my rising to speak had subsided . They watched me in alert silence . " Let us not congratulate ourselves , " I commenced , " on the reasonable mind that sees both sides of every question . Civilized flexibility is a fine thing , and in a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , as everywhere , where the law of diminishing returns sets in . Tepid liberalism that never lashes out at anything , intellects too stocked with information to draw a conclusion , educations scrimped and saved for , that one may dawdle in the green bowers of noncommitment  --  these lack something possessed by an honestbigot . That there is a time to throw stones is a principle I try to follow in my daily life , occasionally to my peril . " I saw Meesum fidget and look down his pew at somebody . Mrs. Sponsible watched from under a dove-gray bonnet with tiny scarlet buds around its crown . I touched the mouse on my right eye and smiled . " Last night I was strolling about the streets of Chickenfoot , as is my wont of a Saturday night "  --  there were severalcoughs into dainty gloved fists  --  " when I saw one of those open-air revivalists who always rub me the wrong way . Perhaps I was too anti-Laodicean here , forgetting that the poor man was only acting according to his lights , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A not altogether soberbystander intervened , a fist fight followed , and then a policeman appeared who carted us both off to the localp200clink . You may imagine that your overheated Saul of Tarsuscooled off pretty fast at this point . In fact , it was worse than that . I felt a perfect ass . " Here Mackerel paused and gazed down at the floor below the pulpit , as though his thinking had stalled . Somewhere some mechanism seemed to have jammed . He smiled abstractedlyand added : " Like the Englishman who reached down the lady 's back for her pearls . " There was an absolute silence . Then the silence began to take on that faintly sizzling quality of a telephone connection . Heads turned and whispers became audible . Meesum 's plucked-chicken neck twisted round to catch von Pantz 's eye . Von Pantz caught the glance of another clinic staff member and the two rose and met at the back , where they were joined by Meesum and another trustee . The four of them went out , their heads together . Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want it ? If ye can not shatter him one way ye will do it another , so that , caught in a vise of tribal manufacture and crazed by lust , he can be delivered over to whichever authorityseems most in line to receive the pieces and seal his doom  --  that about it ? Because the rest of the morning passed off without incident , no more ad libs , but ye have done your work well , 0 my townfolk . And you , Knopf , are you watching ? " Maybe he 's not responsible , " they whisper in little groups as , forgoing the usual suburban handshake this time , he ducks out a side door and hurries along the arcade to the parsonage like one bucking a great wind . Gaining which he sees Hester in the kitchen calmly assemblingthe noonday meal . " I 'm baking the chicken in red wine , " is all she says . " I hope you like it . And there 's plenty of Heineken 's in. "  |p201Nothing  was said about the occurrence all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down late for breakfastto find her reading the Avalon Globe . It was published twice weekly , and this would be the first issue in which it could have run a story about the city hall meeting . " Any trumped-up charges ? " I asked , taking the paper from her eagerly . She rose and went to pour my coffee . " There 's nothing about the meeting at all ( except in generalterms saying that differences were aired between you , " she said . " Nothing about that other at all . " " Then it 's to be a cat-and-mouse , " I said , reading for myselfthe story , abounding in equivocation and tipping no hands , cunningly buried on page sixteen . " I suppose great secrecy would enshroud the recovery of the film . " " I think the paper 's very nice to you , " Hester said , filling my cup . " It takes a while for a gang to seize the means of communication . Putting the screws on the editorial department through the advertising is n't accomplished overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You want them to do you wrong , do n't you ? You 're itchingto have them make a big thing of the film , only to find you innocent and have to be ashamed of themselves . But , Andrew , do be careful . This thing may backfire . " After breakfast I telephoned the Globe office and got Charlie Comstock himself on the wire . I thanked him for the kind write-up , then said , " How much heat are they actually putting on you , after seeing it ? That started yet , Charlie ? " " Heat ? " " Yes . The well-known squeezeroo . Because you do n't think they 're going to let you get away with a soft policy onp202me , are you ? They 'll get to you , and you 'll give me short shrift in the end . I just wanted you to know there 's no personalhard feelings . " " But they actually have talked to me , only the other way around . They nailed me right after the meeting at the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew they 'd been a little highhanded and were sorry . " " Asses ! " I said . " What about the movies ? " " Well , the detective bureau is running that down . George Chance , he 's head of it you know , got in touch with Fort Bliss right away under Sprackling 's orders , but Waldo 's not there . He 's been transferred to the White Sands proving ground in New Mexico , with a two-week transfer furlough , and nobody can locate him . " " I suppose they 'll keep trying ? " " Oh , sure . But he is n't actually due at his new post till next week , you see , so there 's nothing they can do till then . Meanwhile shurtainly hope everything works out for the besht , " Comstock said in the quasi-tipsy voice which was especially noticeable in moments of strain . " Ashk Lord shtraighten you out , Andy . He 'll help you . Look up to him . " I finished my call and carried a second cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a moment of frowning silence , she said , " Andrew , about the film . I have a plan . " " That 's what I was afraid of . " " No , really . What I 'm really quite frightened of is that there wo n't be any picture to clear you , and all this will be left dangling . I have nightmares about it . " " I wish I had nightmares , " I said . " It would imply that I was getting sleep . Never mind your plan . Are we making any strides getting a secretary ? " Hester had undertaken to find me one , advertising in the surrounding help wanted col/umns and screening the applicants . Except that the applicants , however , were almost nonexistent . " They 've heard about you and , well , they'reafraid to take a job in the same office with you , " she said . " It 's as simple as that . Only two answered the ad in the Bridgeport paper yesterday and neither was secretarial timber . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she asked what you were like . They imagine the main qualification is a well-turned ankle . " " They need n't worry about their ankles . I 've got my mind on higher things . " " You going to talk like that in church again Sunday ? " Hester said , lowering her eyes away . " Well , we 'll see . " I backed against the mantel and stood there drinking coffee . " Is it something you ca n't help ? " she asked . " Something that comes over you ? " " Poor Yeats went out in a blaze of lust , and think of Dylan Thomas 's last days . The same thing 's happening to me . It 's a malignant satyriasis , progressive and ingrown . " " Dearest Andrew , will it require surgery ? " " We 'll see about that too . I can thank you for it all . I understand there 's talk of cracking down on old Mackerel . The church board have something cooking , have they ? Come on , girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She broke her hands apart in an elusive gesture and dropped her eyes again . " I hear a Yale divinity student has been alerted to stand by , in case he 's needed . That 's all I know , honestly . If the board 's doing anything more definite I 'm sure they 'll let you know . " They did . I was called on the next evening by a delegationwho said they were anxious about certain rumors conp204cerning my private life , which they wished ardently to doubt but which my behavior in the pulpit last Sunday forced them to give credence . They would like not to see it happenagain . Profanity ( used sparingly and to lend emphasis ) they had no objection to , but smut was something else again . " We know you 're avant-garde and all that , " said Freddy Residue , the junior member who acted as spokesman , " but you 've got to understand other people 's limitations . " If there was a repetition of last week 's occurrence , they would have to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rest of , say , three months till I was myself again . Perhaps I had been overworking , and strain had temporarily unstrung me . If so , the clinic was of course open to all members of the parish for whom any rest or observation was deemed advisable . I said I saw their point of view , and promised to desist from banking on greater resilience than could reasonably be asked of a folk still short of the desired urbanity , ideally speaking . " I ca n't help feeling though , " I said , " it 's something of the old story . Break fresh ground and they 'll bury you in it . " " Oh , I would n't say that , really , " Freddy Residue replied in his eagerly amiable way . " It 's just our old friend , enoughis-enough , if you know what I mean . " " So we have a hush-hush attitude toward sex here . Is that what we have in these parts then , Residue ? " " Oh , it 's not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't consider myself a prig , but one does draw the line , you know . " " I suppose . Still I ca n't help feeling that the pressure is more than what 's called for . That certain forces are leagued against me . I hope I 'm man enough for the chopping blockp205if it comes to that , but I must say , why ca n't we have progresswithout shedding all this bloody blood ! " They looked to von Pantz , also present , with an intimationof its perhaps having worked its way into his province . But he declined exercising a professional role except in private , and turned the conversation to other matters , the ultimatumhaving been presumably deposited . He made some vague rejoinder , and then inquired whether I had got anothersecretary for the office . They had some urgent extra mimeographing at the clinic and he wondered what the chances were of " moochink a hand from headquarters . " I said we had n't got a girl yet but would let him know as soon as we did . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and von Pantz recalled for our amusementone he 'd had in Leipzig who could only take dictation directly at the typewriter , though her speed made the method very nearly feasible . As he talked , I studied him with my usual interest . He was part schnauzer , though the strain would have been more marked had he let his hair grow and his mustache friz out a bit . He clipped his mustache and cut his hair close to the scalp  --  so close that the top of his flat head looked like a carpet sample . It matched absolutely the pewterrug on the floor of his office . He represented the return to orthodoxy , and was said to believe in the Devil . " Still she was quite a pretty girl , " he mused in conclusion . " I hated to leave her behind . " " Her what ? " I said . " Behind . " " Now you 're doing it ! " I exclaimed , pointing at him . " Listen to von Pantz , everybody . He 's getting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little exegesis of what he had saidp206soon established his skill at double entendre . Von Pantz rose , stomping to his feet , and shook his finger over me . " I will not be dragged into zis ! " he said . " I will not be made party to zis awful thing you are in the grip of . Now I do n't care . " There were tears in his eyes , and his expression was not one of anger so much as a kind of violent petulance . Somebody rose and put an arm around him , to quiet him . I am always amazed at the infantilism one encounters in supposedly adult people . They are those whom the rest of us must make up for ; must " carry , " so to speak , in the round of social transactions that go to make up mature human life . Add to which mountainous enough hazard , never kid a kraut . I apologized and he was calmed down . But the other committee members , three in number , pointed out that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which they had come to discuss , and before departing they repeated their ultimatum . If there was a repetition of this sort of thing at morning service next Sunday , they would have no choice but to demand my removal to the clinic for an indefinite rest and observation . I stood at the window watching them get into their cars . I shook my head . It was obvious which way the wind was blowing , and what pretexts were being resorted to . By the time they got through with Mackerel , Knopf would n't have a leg to stand on . If the church had been crowded last time , this time they turned them away . People seemed to have come not only from all over Avalon but from surrounding townships and even from outside the state to hear the new sensation , because a few New York license plates were seen among thep207endemic station wagons and convertibles parked on the lot and both ways along the road . When Mackerel rose to deliverthe sermon , a profound hush fell over the audience instantly . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any emergency . Four large , muscular orderliesfrom the clinic were posted with conspicuous nonchalanceat different points in the worship area . They were all in aisle seats and all within sight of von Pantz , who was to give the signal to rise and move down to the platform on the first sign of fireworks . This was obvious from the way they kept glancing over at him . " Our text for this morning is from the Gospel according to St. Matthew , the twenty-sixth chapter , verse seventythree , " I began . " It is the scene outside the palace of Caiaphasthe high priest , where the bystanders say to Peter , Surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee . ' " I took a swallow of water and set the glass down again . I drew the paper clip from my manuscript . It was a manuscriptthere had been none to retype for me , besides being wreathed in late marginal interpolations , from which fresh impromptus might supposedly flower .. . " I would like to consider with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diction , not merely as a surface trait but as an expression of national or racial character , dwelling particularly on the long-labored distinction betweenBritish and American speech , and the argument as to who best uses the language we allegedly share . " I know it 's customarily assumed that the English pick up the marbles here  --  marbles being what the cisatlantic mouth is supposedly full of . But I wonder . I mean I wonder if that 's all there is to the argument as to who best uses the mother tongue as laid out for us in Webster 's dictionary.  |p208Has  it ever struck you , hearing an example of so-called impeccableBritish diction , that while the diction is precise enough , it is in the service of noises curiously at variance with the official spelling ? I have given a lot of prayerful consideration to this matter , and I think that the difference , dearly beloved , lies in this . That Americans mumble correctpronunciations while the British clearly articulate faulty ones . Let us take a few examples of what I mean . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reliefthat Mackerel was adhering to his prepared text , and confidence that everything would be all right this morning . " The American  --  be he from Manhattan , Brooklyn , Chicago or Texas  --  knows that the letters p-o-e-t-r-y , for instance , spell the word poetry . He may slur that word or he may in some other way fall short of giving it its due . But he does not say paitry . ' That he does not say . He says poet , not pate . He will not read to you from his paims ; he will read to you , however miserably , from his poems . His conversation may be as dull as ditchwater , but he will not , immaculately delineating each syllable , refer to something as doll as ditchwoetuh . ' That is not what those letters spell . He answersthe phone , not the fen ; takes planes , not a plen ; goes to a play , not a pleb . Why envy or emulate this gabble ! The letters p-l-a-y comprise , I submit to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American empire last a thousand years , ever constitute a sequence of characters calling for the sound pleb ' ! " " Hyah , hyah ! " cried an educated but feverishly nationaIisticHarvardian named Yates from the third pew , in spontaneousapproval . Others nodded and beamed theirs . I was inspired to go on . " Let Americans square their shoulders against the canard under which they have so long groaned , that of British supe/riority on this as other scores . They may lack what labial and glottal grace it takes to say , To you , my dear , ' but they do n't , raising their glass , say Chew my dim . ' Ile Yankee may mangle the language , but at least he opens his goddam mouth ! " The congregation was deeply moved . They had not heard such a ringing affirmation of faith from an American pulpit in a long time . Two people did get up and walk out , but they were the Arbuckle cousins who did so out of protest at what they considered to be anti-British sentiment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of pleasure in the message , inspiring though that was , but also because they were glad for Mackerel . It looked as though he was going to make it  --  get to the end of his sermon without mishap . No digressions lured him ; no temptations rose in his path in the form of words offering double entendres and other appealsto the base nature . I sailed along through eight minutes , nine , ten . With sixty seconds to go , I peered to make out a penciled emendation at the end of a paragraph . " Thus we see that such slight matters as vocal inflection mirror what are deeply rooted traits . The American 's brash unconcern for nuance indicates a young and vigorous country , the Briton 's clipped speech an ancient , proverbial reserve . The difference comes equally into customs and  --  " Was that the word " folk " or " fond " or " food " or what scribbled in there ? Folkways ? Fond ways ? I was thrown off my stride . I scratched my head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Folkways , " I said , raising my head . " Nothing gives us more keenly the sense of novelty than someone else 's . I recentlyhad dinner at the home of acquaintances in Norwalk , " I went on , ignoring my manuscript for a moment top210recall the incident . " As we finished our coffee I saw that the ladies alone were rising from the table and being shepherded into the drawing room while the host remained behind with the men . I perceived that here in Fairfield County , Connecticut , far in space and time from the Victorian London where it had once flourished , we were observing the custom of the fairer sex separating themselves from the men while the latter remained behind over their port and walnuts . The hostess , perhaps noticing the impression the maneuver made on guests accustomed to less quaint patterns of conduct , said apologetically aside to one or two of us , I hope you do n't mind . My husband 's English , and he likes to withdraw . ' " Von Pantz nodded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one another , and took lounging but alert positions against the walls . Their faces were impassive , but the audience 's ? Their eyes implored me not to . " Do n't succumb , " their collective gaze entreated . Many leaned forward , gripping the pews in front of them , or sat with hands clasped tightly in their laps . Hester bowed her head . Old Meesum was inscrutable , but watchful . Charlie Comstock wet his lips . The temptation in whose grip I writhed had for him its own clear and terrible parallel . The double entendre that beckoned was like that glass of whiskey round which the drinker has but to close his fingers to end the struggle and start a fresh cycle of degradation . " Do n't touch it , " Comstock 's eyes begged . " Hold tight . We 're all with you . " A man mopped his brow . A woman prayed . I moistened my own lips . I reached for the glass of water and took another gulp , seeing the bruisers move another inch closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerfulcats they were . I put the glass back , and stood shiftingp211my weight from one leg to the other . The cable of self . control stretched ; frayed ; raveled to a thread ; held . My voice was but to be heard stepping on to the next thought , or betteryet returning to the prepared text from which it had wandered , and it would be like a foot safely planted on the far bank of a pause now intolerably prolonged . I raised my head and grinned out at them . " That , madam , ' I replied , strikes me as carrying AngloSaxonrestraint a little too far . ' "  |p212IT  WAS a warm , cool day in early spring . The leaves had n't begun to bud yet , though , so I had a view through bare treetops of the countryside on at least two sides of the high ground on which I strolled . It was sunny and bright , and as I idled up the gravel paths with that doublesense of another fresh day and a newly minted season , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willows that grew at the far limit of the grounds . Except for a handful of people promenading , singly and in pairs , and a few sunning themselves in Adirondack chairs near the main building , I was pretty much alone outside this morning . Perhaps it was still early . Ten o'clock , I saw by my watch . On the highest point on this landscaped knoll , and of Avalon as well , I stood a moment gazing off into the blue distance . Of the several houses visible , two were those of members of P.L. , and I had therefore been inside them in happier times . One was said to have a ghost . The place was a converted barn haunted , apparently , by a horse , said to be an old plug who had lived there before it was torn down for remodeling ; the last animal , in fact , left in it , who had been taken out and shot to make way for construction . The rat/fling chains and thumpings at midnight attested to by the present owners suggested a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had done him in and taken his home . The other was a spanking new modern job designed by Marcel Breuer . It was so new that the price tags were still on the shrubbery with which it was landscaped , though the explanation of the couple who lived there , Marian and Freddy Residue , was that on the reverse of these were the names of the various plants , by which she would identify them when they bloomed . Just over the flat roof I caught a blue haze , a dim translucence of water , and I thought I made out a thin line of beach and even the bridge that spanned the tidal river there . It was a bridge desertednow , but on which , in summer , girls in bathing suits strolled all day and men loitered eating hot dogs and drinkingsoda pop , to watch them parade . It was a local institutionknown , consequently , as the Bridge of Thighs . My eye was jerked to the right by a figure of quite anothersort . Emerging from a black sedan and walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in a tan suit and checked vest whom I knew I knew . Then I remembered . It was George Chance , chief of detectives . He was a portly number who had all through his schooldays been nicknamed , inevitably , Fat Chance . He was trying to live it down now , from what I gathered of him  --  the few times I 'd met him and even from what I could sense in his bearing now . Rotundities fore and aft made him resemble , from the side prospect , a pair of parentheses that have slipped out of line . He marched into the front door and disappeared . I knew where von Pantz 's office was in the line of first-story windows visible through the shrubbery from here , andp214watching , sure enough , I caught a dim stir of motion behind it , which would be von Pantz rising to let Fat Chance in . I turned and after a last comprehensive gaze of the kind we give a panorama we are taking leave of , a kind of visual gulp , I walked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sitting in my few weeks ' stay at this plaisance . I had left a New York Times on it , and setting my switch aside , I opened it up . I had not been reading long when voices near the building , now at my back , made me turn round . Young Evans , the bright-eyed , clean-cut bore from the Yale DivinitySchool , who was occupying my pulpit during the rest I was taking , said a last word to a nurse in the side doorway and struck out across the grass in my direction . I quickly lay down on the bench , drawing the Times over my face . He had a distance of two hundred yards to come , so it was some moments before he arrived . I heard his footsteps when they reached the gravel walk , twenty yards back . They grew louder , and stopped . He was standing over me , hesitating no doubt . I was safe under my cover . In the interval in which he stood there I reviewed the defects which unfit him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterian background which he found it possible to pride himself on not having shaken off . Next was the oppressive earnestness with which he went about his work , carrying a pocket Testamenton his pastoral rounds and speaking of a Crusade for the suburbs , in which everyone would come in for a complete spiritual check-up . Next was a resort to bland euphemismsin personal conversation , such as his first greetingto me , " Taking your vacation early , are you ? " Add to these a tendency to little informal homilies about how radar , jet propulsion and such modern things had always existedin nature , and you can see why he was not long forp215this community . You can bore all of the people some of the time , you can bore some of the , et cetera . My breathing was regular . I even turned orb a light snore I had developed to discourage visitors and even those sibilantministers of mercy known as nurses , indoors and out . At last Evans turned and walked away . ' When I felt it safe to leave my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a calling card on the bench at my feet , with the jolly penciledinscription , " Hope you 're feeling better , old chap ! " Shredding this moodily , I watched the approach of a pair of strollers . They were both men , one a fellow named Jackson whom I liked very much . He had confided in me that his tongue was too big for the floor of his mouth . It lay upwardagainst his lower teeth like the edge of a rug against the wainscoting of a room too small for it . " Great architect ! " he said . " Huh ! " I heard another footfall ; this time one I knew well . I looked up and was not surprised to see von Pantz . I sat up and swung my feet over the bench . He sat down and joined me . " Spring in the air , " he said . " I almost could , " I answered , appreciating the chance for one of those fancies that grieved his tedious Teutonic heart . " What ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiked up a trouser leg to cross his knees , and settled himself for one of his talks . He wore the same blue serge he always did , and those bulbous-toed shoes that are known , I believe , as bluchers . His clothes were all of good quality , except for his neckties , which seemed to have been bought at the Army and Navy store . His eyes were large and brown , and looked like boiled chestnuts . I was used to a roundabout approach , supported by transparent indirections and heavy German subtleties . But this time it was a frontal attack.  | " So your idea is to feign incompetence in hopes that you wo n't be held responsible , " he said . " For what ? " I answered . I spread my arms along the back of the bench and crossed my legs . " You know what . " " Is that what Fat Chance told you to come out here and try ? " Von Pantz looked away and shook his head . I said , " At least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done with it . Today they 're more civilized . They turn you slowly on a spit . " " How do you account for your behavior in the pulpit if it was n't to give that impression ? It all fits perfectly as part of a scheme  --  crazy like a fox ! " Von Pantz sprang to his feet and began to pace a limited area of the gravel path in front of me . " A man sees ze evidence closing in , and he gives ze wildest possible account of himself in a frenzied attempt to beat ze rap . " It was when he most strove to affect slang Americanisms that his Viennese accent oftenest crept from its lair to do him in . " What did Chance want ? " " He said ze film has been found and ze evidence is damagink . " Von Pantz turned away and stood stock-still a momentlooking into the distance , as though helping imbibe , on my behalf , great drafts of natural beauty I would not long be here to share . " Then why does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung round to me again . " Because you are now under my jurisdiction , and I give you sanctuary here . " He was tense , almost hysterical . He stood directly in front of me gesturing with both hands . A single gold tooth at the back of his mouth flickered like a firefly as he talked . " I am trying to help you , to save you , but I can not do it medicallyp217because I do not think the trouble is medical . It is spiritual . Oh , yes ! I use zat word . I am not ashamed of it . I say that you are in the grip of sin  --  zat word too . I.know it is n't fashionable today but we are coming back to it , mark my word . Because we have done away with the concept of sin , yet never has a generation been more obsessed with guilt . It is part of every modern man 's equipment . " I remembered Tumbull 's having said something of this sort , and wondered if he had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not give me zat here-we-go-again look . Jung used to say to me , Hugo , some people ca n't be cured  --  they can only be saved . ' There is a way open to you , a young intellectual with something missing in his life . A tortured young man for whom there is only one salvation "  --  here he drew a deep , defiant breath  --  " to make a decision for Christ . " A puff of wind had blown a page of the Times to the ground and I bent to pick it up . Von Pantz straightened and tightened his stance . He fixed me with a look at once dramatically hard and infinitely gentle . " I 'm going to put this question , this choice up to you now , " he said . " Reverend Mackerel , do you now , and before God , accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior ? " I shook my head with a friendly little laugh . " Look , von Pantz , there 's really no point in this . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye to eye . " He raised his voice . " Let 's forget about seeing eye to eye , it 's not an intellectual matter  --  let 's try to see heart to heart ! " " Oh , rubbish , " I said , bouncing to my feet and raising my own voice . " Let 's knock it off . You do n't have any use for my viewpoint and I do n't have any use for yours , and certainly not for your godforsaken theology ! "  |p218He  became livid , and seemed to rise up and down on his heels . " There 's something evil in you ; why do n't you recognize it and call it by its name ! It 's something you should fear and hate . " " There 's only one thing I fear and hate , " I said , shaking my face in his , " and that 's people shirking the obligation to evolve ! ' Which I consider god-given , if all our sweating historyup from the muck on this rotten ball and up into somethingresembling human grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shouted , in one of those bursts of profanity whose roots lie so close to those of reverence . " I 'm sick of this nursery room pie-in-the-sky backsliding revivalism ! And I 'm especially sick of seeing the clock turned back by people who should know better ! Now how do you like that ? " " I like it ! " he shouted back , so close to me that I could feel his breath , which smelt of some not disagreeable commerciallozenge . " It proves what I 'm saying , that something has got you in its grip . Do you think you set a good example to people I might try to help with Christian therapy ? Is it nice of you to badger servants of God in public ? " " There are times when anything else is wrong , by my standards . A little less Christian charity with such boobs and sucklings ; a little more Christ-like irritability please ! " " By God , you 've got a messianic complex , " he said , turning away again . " I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said nothing , just shook his head , one method of filling a discomposinggap . " You want to know what happened in the pulpit and so on . I 'll tell you . There are plenty of Freudian terms for it , but I have n't time to bring you abreast of developments in that field so 1 ' 11 just use Edgar Allan Poe 's term for it  --  the Imp of the Perverse . A part of you that you do n't want to take over but does . Call it an island broken offp219the mainland and floating away by itself , or trying to if it is n't fetched back . Or perhaps I can explain it to you in another way . Under these stresses and strains , oat part of the personality separates ' from the other precisely like the cream in a bottle of milk . Your job  --  homogenize me . " I sat down on the bench again . We did n't look at one another for a minute or more . Then an almost involuntary glance on his part brought my own eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the portico there , Fat Chance stood leaning against a white pillar , watching us . Some gesture from von Pantz , which I am assuming because I did n't actually see it , brought him down off the portico and across the intervening ground toward us . " Zis dick wants to talk to you , " von Pantz said . He spoke rapidly , so as to finish what he had to say in conclusion before we were joined . " We have no more to say to each other , I am sorry to say . I ca n't do anything for you , in any way . I ca n't certify you . There is nothing for me to do but turn you over to the authorities who want you . " I reached into my pocket for a cigarette and lit it . " I guess we both lost our heads , " I said . " Surely we can talk about all these things that interest us later . I was thinkingI 'd have myself voluntarily committed ... " " Committed ! You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sorry , Mackerel . I 've done all I can , and I regret all too keenly that it 's so little . I have no choice but to release you and let you take your chances with the law . " Chance had a dozen yards or so to come , time enough for me to answer : " All right , keep your not very satisfactorily run establishment . And I 'll report my impression of it too  --  all the racket and what-not going on among the help at all hours . I 'm still a trustee , remember . " I lowered my voice , remembering that it was my belief that I was a trustee **26;11362;TOOLONG ' for me . Ghitler , Ghhitler . Ach , it is not easy to do things the right way , but it is always possible , ja ? , always possible , my friend . " He had said " my friend " and taken Schild 's hand . Russian male friends kissed on meeting and walked hand-in-hand , yet since 1917 homosexuality had all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's smooth palm , Lichenko approved : " Your German , you know , is excellent . Was this learned in the wonderful American schools ? " Oh , partly , and in part from a grandfather . Schild was pleased and apprehensive at once , the latter from questioning , any questioning . " You are of German descent , then ? Does it give you a queer feeling to return to your old motherland as an enemy ? The Russianword is rodina . Rodina  --  motherland . I will teach you the Russian language in this manner , term by term , although I am Ukrainian . But Russian nowadays is more useful , yes ? But you are German ? " Schild smiled lazily to let it pass , but Lichenko ripped at his fingers : " Tell me , tell me ! " Sneezes , orgasms , interrogations , their irrevocable end is ordainedin their beginning . " Ich bin judisch . " " I see , I see ! Then it is not queer but pleasant ! " Lichenko grinned  --  indeed , he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his irregular nose was lumpy with grin , these along with his winged thighs making him a Mercury of mirth . It was , frankly , a private thing , which he could respect while not losing any skin from his own ass . And he was soon away to other pictures and objets d'art , furniture , rugs , and the dark-blue wallpaper with its silver suggestionsof flower petals dissolving in ink . He bounced into an obese chair , which bounced him halfway out . He sneaked care/fully back into place , and the chair submitted to good manners . As for Schild , he sat crosslegged at its side on the floor . Lichenko 's German was very good , too , for he was an educatedman , an engineer , in fact , although the war had caught him before he finished school . His intended specialty concerned dams and sluiceways , the diversion of streams , paradises from deserts , the transformation of the face of the earth , or anyway one-sixth of it . Nor was Soviet engineering a cultural Siberia . He slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was better than oriented . " We read American books in the Soviet Union ! " he shouted happily , digging his hard heels into the floor . " More than we do Russian . Also , more than you read in the United States . You know , of course , that American authors would starve but for the money they get from Soviet sales . " " I know , " said Schild , who did , at that moment ; did , because fact can be countermanded by wish and hope and generosity and brotherhood , else we are lost . " Have you read Dreiser ? " he asked . " The greatest American writer , " replied Lichenko . " But Upton Sinclair Lewis is schon , too , and Jack London 's Babbitt and The Iron Heel . " " I met Dreiser once . " " Also , " Lichenko mumbled , removing his cap and testing his forehead with a sweaty palm . " He spoke at the school where I taught . A great , majestic man , a champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I suppose you know . " " Es interessiert mich das zu wissen , " said Lichenko vaguely , but hopped to his feet positively , and bowed . For there stood Leek . " Now , you ca n't keep our ally out of circulation ! " she chided , and led Lichenko to the dancing area  --  though not before Schild was constrained to translate some small-talk , including a Sovietp102tribute to womanhood in an ornate German that englished as something Albert might have said to Victoria ; nor before he volunteered to hold the doffed but troublesome cap , Lichenko having been at a loss for a cache where that article would be neither crushed nor stolen . A universal sense of fun could not be withstood . The troublesomeshortage of fuel reached Lichenko 's apparatus , without benefit of Schild , and he laughed long and loud , tore himself from the Siamese coupling with Leek , and shot into the kitchen and out the back door . He reappeared with a shoulder sack of bottles : vodka , schnapps , whisky , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reinhart , Schild saw , glided about as if on figure skates with the large nurse , in the perfect attitude of the adolescent sexual captive : closed eyes , back arched affetuoso . A more direct confirmation of the reputed egalitarianism of medical units could not be imagined . Schild thought about Lichenko , who had so little and so much . Throw the switch of the time machine and there he was , with his cartload of firewood , ankle-deep in mire , on his weary animalway to the sod hut , the black bread , and the cabbage ; the trashy icons ; the spent wife ; the ravished , if pretty , the prematurelyaged , if plain , daughter ; swearing so vilely that if his master had the ill fortune to canter past , he might have got another crop 's end for his lifelong collection of abuse . Born old , senile at twenty , dead at forty , without ever having passed through the human . A lump of dung , hating love and beauty and intelligence because he was defined by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grease befoul the lips and drip from the chin , fill the gut with the stolen bottle , and when it explodes in the head , give the wife a fist to her decaying teeth and the daughter a hand between her thighs , because you are beyond judgment , beyond hope . But not beyond history , which moves not for revenge or profit or virtue , but for the negation of negation , the arrangement of disorder , above all , for an end to waste.  |p103These  things mature without ever having been formally born . Lichenko was , of a sudden , disorderly . Only a moment earlier he had displayed high , good , and legitimate spirits ; now he had enrolled in that brotherhood of savage peoples from whom firewatershould be , and often is , legally withheld . His maw sagged ; his eye carmined ; he drank as if , oblivious to the torrent that washed his face and gummed his tunic , he hungered for glass , and proved it by incising a piece of the tumbler 's rim . A pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the afterpunchmake-up of movie martyr-priests who may invite their adversary to put on the gloves but never return the favor ad hoc . Amidst all those medics his wound went unattended , on the theory that if he lost enough blood he might collapse peaceably . But he had just begun to play . After checking Leek in an armchair , he detonated into the frenzy of a solo jackknife dance . The floor quaked , for although he was small , the boards were simpaticowith his rhythm ; the rolled carpet against the far wall , which was not , had its long , heavy belly rent by a boot-heel . With such sport , with Lovett impotently aflutter , with Nader enveloping himself in the phonograph wires , with the awed company 's disengagement , the room was progressively demolished . Lichenko 's success with the carpet sent him to Leek 's chair , which , after removing her , he ruined with a single jump , hard heels forward ; he smashed the mantlepiece mirror , pelted coal cakes in black bursts against a carved lowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many tumblers , and shouted " Bezbol ! " Then , to Schild , he said : " Fascists . " " Yes , " answered Schild . " Not the Americans . " " No . " " The Germans . Why should this house be spared ? If you saw what they did in my country . . . " He sank wearily into the chair and passed a hand across his face . He signaled to Leek , pointingat his lap . She sat there submissively , bovinely , as he read her idly in Braille.  |p104Still  on the floor , Schild shifted his weight from left to right ham and adjusted his pistol belt . " Will you permit me to see your weapon ? " asked Lichenko . He ejected Leek . He looked feverish as he palmed the Colt . A vein in his forehead pumped into prominence . He worked the action , stroked the barrel , warmed it with his cheek , and peeped down the muzzle . He found the clip , extracted it , loosened a bullet , felt its slug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piece at the still proximate Leek , went " Boom , boom ! " or thereabouts in Russian vowels , finger on trigger guard . Ignoring her squeak , squeaking himself in delight , he took out his own pistol and thrust it butt first at Schild . " We 'll exchange . Then we 'll each have a souvenir of a time we will never forget . " It was what the Russians called a Nagan , a cheaply made capgunaffair , but Schild accepted it reverently , and , though he detestedfirearms , gave an earnest imitation of Lichenko 's ecstasy over the Colt . " You agree ? You will exchange ? " shouted Lichenko . " My dear friend , I salute you ! " On his feet , he highballed with the right hand , a dwarf against the bas relief of the large Americans who had started to surge genially upon him through the dismembered furniture . Schild was rising in honor of the moment , at the very least to return the salute , when Lichenko began to discharge the .45 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salute to fortune , but the kick from the one convulsed his hand into another , and he was drawn nolens volens into a full tribute . Below the scored ceiling and within the vermiculated walls , Lichenko , now-spent gun drooping , sniffed the atmosphere of powder , appeared about to sneeze , did not , and pushed a reproachfullower lip like a coal chute at Schild . " Ah , my friend , this American pistol ! " He tore at his choker collar . " Excuse me , Vasya is ill . . . "  |p105And  fell prone into the plaster , which , of course , was now the common ground . " You win the medal , " said Lieutenant Leek , an unjolly snowman , to Schild . He blew clean his glasses and inquired silently with blurred vision . " For Number One Horse 's Ass , Berlin District . " Nader touched Schild 's elbow and whispered : " Look , Jack , Lovett went for the MPs . Get your ass-hole buddy out of here . We 'll con them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingered back an eyelid , peered at the red orb . " Drunk as a skunk . " " He ordered Corporal Reinhart to lend a hand . Reinhart lifted Lichenko by the belt and pulled him over a shoulder . " Veronica , why do n't you go along ? " asked Nader . " Jesus , maybe he 's dead . " " O.K. Thanks for the party , " said she . " I had a lovely time anyhow . " Reinhart navigated through the rear door and into the garden . Already military-police sirens sounded in the distance . Through the back yards , having trouble at every sonbitching fence , and around the block to Schild 's house was their silent way . Reinhart'scalves were tired on the stairs , but he gripped the banister and made it in good shape to the room , where as his burden was lowered to the bed it came to life briefly , displaying a revolving eye , and returned to dreamland with a mouthful of bedspread . Veronica examined the body from a distance , found it hale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , to do this for that Russian . If his army found out about it he 'd be headed for Siberia . " And Very seconded that . " I think , " said Schild , " the American Army is what we have to worry about at the moment . " He took a tiny package from his pocket . " Can you use these ? "  |p106Anybody  who ever opened a K ration had Fleetwood cigarettes to dispose of , yet Reinhart was sure these were his own come home . He was too weary , the evening had been too extravagant , to inquire by what route . New relations consisting so fiercely in the precise time of day and the specific mise en scene , the sudden dislocation of these threw both Very and Reinhart into a diffidence , especially now as , their task ended , they went out of step down the sidewalk to Very 's house . From the side of his eye Reinhart could see her shoulder bag swinging off the divisions of silence . An occasionalofficer or nurse , not breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the party . Down the street , its siren dying like a throttled pussycat , another MP jeep arrived . At her door , Reinhart chickened out of trying for a good-night kiss , perhaps with a view towards establishing his independence , which , in the pale simulacrum of post coitum tristis that was his after-party letdown , he felt had been compromised . Or perhaps it was a defense against the progressive frigidity she gave off as they approached the front step . " Oh this is where you live ? " he asked numbly . " Haha ! Were you going to charge me with breaking and en-tering ? " This cruel parody of his own earlier fantasies on the mansion of her person , despite the false laughter  --  whose spuriousness was advertised by its miraculous lack of resonance ; it was as if a great bell rang so shallowly that nothing trembled  --  suddenly elicited his overdue response to Lichenko 's rampage . To assault an entity of order , to register a spontaneous nay against the sanctioned and authorized ; mean , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very skipped insouciantly inside the doorway . Shortly , her other end appeared , saying : " See you in the funny papers . " pp107CAPTAIN St. George 's surprise was limited . He had rapped at and opened Schild 's door on his regular schedule of unnecessary morning information  --  " The bath is free "  --  and looked upon a scrawny , alien fundament . Lichenko , rump to door , was bent in a study of his big toe . Schild 's guest had awakened with a refusal to recognize his benefactor . Something Schild however took in good grace and did not sully with a word as the Russian scratched an elusive cap-a-pie itch , lip-farted at his own image in the mirror , and spat a long drizzle of saliva out the window in droll reproof of the sunlight that made him wince . Then he turned , said with ill humor : " Da , " and undressed for an examination of his pelt . St. George recovered with expedition . " I thought you had a woman in here , " he chortled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been his bed . Arising with the aid of the dresser corner , khaki undershirt and shorts clinging to him like old crepe paper , sallow , hairy , shivering  --  Berlin'sair in the shadows stayed cold till noon  --  Schild said as St. George averted his eyes : " So what else is new ? " He watched the dull pain fill the captain 's eyelids , distend his cheeks , sag the loose mouth , and lower the chin , going down like mercury in a chill . It was a kind of crying just beneath the epidermis ; years of it had made his face one big bag . St. George addressed himself to the oval mirror on the dresser . " Do you know ? " His ebullience had left . " Is it necessary to have an electric shaver honed every so often ? Mine is beginning to pull . " He held the device towards Schild , retaining the pillbox affair which made any current American . " Duncroft , " he went on , " says it ca n't be done . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones and thereby putp108themselves out of business . They 're going to want to sell you a new one , he says . But he 's always cynical . " Lichenko left off his big toe and went over the others , as if in count ; midway through the left foot , he lost his sum and began again . " Did you see a strange man as you entered this room ? " asked Schild . " A refugee from the party , I take it . " St. George twisted the top of a battered tin of GI foot powder , sifted a quantity into his palm , and traced rhomboids with his fingertip . Later , as he and Schild crossed the street towards breakfast at the 1209th officers ' mess , to which St. George had got their small unit attached for rations , he said : " Strange how when you meet a man who 's naked you do n't get to know much about him . Maybe we all rely too much on externals , but that 's the way it goes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the to him anonymous faces of the party , and occasionally received a curious but cordial nod . He was also aware , from time to time , of the regard of multiple eyes and the drone of comment at adjoiningtables as he forked in his Harvard beets and masticated the grainy roast , but was conscious of no ill will , nor , in his sense of the word , suspicion . Once he saw Lovett across the tent , fragmentingbread with neurasthenic fingers and spotting the pieces individually over his tray , which could also be interpreted as evidence of placidity . But after one lunch , Nader met him outside . " Did you pack off the Russky ? Dewey 's going to make trouble , mark my words , because the Old Man 's about to hang it on him . " " I 'll make it good , " said Schild . " It was my fault . I gave him the gun . " " Well by Jesus we 'll put in a complaint through the Kommandatura , " Nader said . " Just write down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He rummaged in his pockets for writing materials.  |p109Both  extremities of Nader 's pencil bore chewmarks . His paper was the reverse of a snapshot carrying the pale-violet emblem of an Oklahoma developer . Schild wrote , slovenly : " Lt. Krylenko , Engrs Corps , Red Army . " " I do n't have much hope this will find him . " He smiled commiseration . " But you wo n't have to . Just let me know the amountof the damage , and I 'll see you get reimbursed in full . I 'll see your C.O. myself this afternoon . You 'll be fully cleared . " " Now , " said Nader , " I know you 're oke , but you 'll do best by us if you crap out early . What I mean is  --  " He broke off until the pencil was reseated in his breast pocket and the flap buttoned . " Let me as somebody who was soldiering when you , Dewey Lovett , and anybody else in this road show was still sucking titty . Know the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll never find the Russian , but the thing will be wrapped up and Dewey will stop pissing and moaning . " " I thought it was simple decency to get him out of your place ahead of the MPs , " said Schild . " That officer fought all the way from Stalingrad to Berlin . It would be outrageous if his first defeatcame from blowing out some German plaster . " " As long as we 're off the hook , old buddy , that 's all , as long as we 've got something to hand them . The phony name you wrote down here will do as well as another . " He showed his chipped teeth in amiable pride . " What time I have left from being personnel officer , unit censor , permanent O.D. , fire officer , postal officer , and post-exchange officer , I put to provost marshaling . You 'd never make a successful crook . " Nader 's hairy wrist disposed of all possible demurrers , embarrassments , confusions . " Hell , I remember his name , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his minor deception freed Schild to submit the whole affair to a lens , under which he saw : being caught out by such a man and in such a way was not a demerit . Nader pushed the snapshot at him . " You still did n't look atthe picture on the other side . " A ripe piece of girl in her late teens sat on the first step of ap110rotting porch . In the background depended the rusty chains of an old slat swing ; through one link , the shaft of a raffia fan . As she cuddled a stuffed panda , her deep lower lip sat in transitory melancholia , or what may have been counterfeit desire . Pleats of voile skirt fell gradually away at the thigh on the viewer 's side , as if at the border of some proscenium arch through which shortly a young man with haircut , black suit , and cascaded necktiewould heel-and-toe as commencement valedictorian . She was relaxed or prepared to spring , according to which evidence had more weight : the tension of the femoral muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawers . This was an exercise to put Schild on his mettle . How to communicatein the proper measure somewhere between coarseness and patronage . For Nader , in the classic manner of such picturepassers , watched him as a bank guard observes an unshaven man ; that self of his which dwelt in Nader 's mind was about to acquire a habitation and a name . Schild suddenly ached with regret that he could not miraculously reduce his size and quality to the mode of the image and plunge into that seedy , sweaty , alien world of dessicated lumber , rusty metal , the treasures of shooting galleries , the failures of fabric , unshaven armpits , sagging washlines , off-stage radios , that universe of the enervated Sunday , and make animal love to the girl . Not having that option , he grinned wryly and said : " Choice " ; watching it join the communityin the wallet . " I believe the idea now is to ask who is she ? " " You do n't know any less than I do , " Nader replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlisted men 's dance in the service club at Camp Grant , Ill . I carry it for laughs . " Schild returned to the tent for another cup of coffee , the dregs of which he hung over until the last eater had departed and it was seemly to draw and transport Lichenko 's rations . He did not know why his guest remained , but it could hardly have been for " his big brown eyes . " A phrase from his father 's code , applied to those business associates whose sudden appearance of friendshipp111logic and experience exposed as conspiracy . A " friend " dropping into the office for a smoke was of course a spy who mentally photographed a new button and , within half an hour after his departure , set up machinery to reproduce the plagiarism in quantity , to steal the orders of the first party and libel him to the stolen customers as a thief to confound . He carried the laden tray towards the billet . It could hardly have been for his big brown eyes that Lichenko lingered . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his violent attempts at negation that , as he crossed the street , became exterior , the ultimate ineffectuality . He shook his whole body as if in a chill , and the spinach in the end compartment , having by nature no integrity , easily lost its coherence and slipped over the rim like a string of mucus . Lichenko could be on furlough , on extended pass , on some perfectlyuncomplicated special duty from which he had legally or illegally gleaned four days of liberty ; he may have been lost , have searched in vain the wilderness of Berlin for his unit , temporarilyhave given up . He was perhaps a liaison man between Red and American Intelligences , who  --  the Soviets being no fools in these matters  --  could better prosecute his purpose by four or five days ' discretion , especially around an idiot like St. George , who , it could quickly be seen by a shrewd fellow , would fly all to pieces at the first suspicion that his outfit was to have a serious role . There were , too , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even , of course , desertion . NotwithstandingSchild 's automatic rejection of anti-Soviet messhall gossip that " hundreds " of Russian soldiers had decamped to the Allied sectors , which if true would have been a lie , he was certain that it was true in cases . It was something that could be faced without equivocation . Renegades ye will always have with you . In the middle of the street , a two-and-a-half ton truck nearly ran him down , the driver leaning out to carp , spotting the silverp112bar , recovering . A fine midsummer sun crafted suburban shadows which lay only slightly to the northeast of their objects , the time standing not far beyond one o'clock ; that extreme portion of the sky that to the grounded seems at last palpable but to the winged is merely the middle distance towards another intangibility , hung unusually high even for Berlin . A soldier in fatigues lingered on the stair of one of the officers ' homes , in the grip of an internal monologue that he broke off to inspect Schild with academic superiority , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . Shortly such a person , wearing a khaki undershirt , appeared at the door and bellowed : " Bugger off , Wilbur ! " As Wilbur without acknowledgment merged with the shrubbery , this undershirt shouted : " Bugger you , too , Rosenthal ! " One thing was certain : Schild 's eyes did not improve over the years . " Ca n't you see ? It 's Young ! . . . Oh , I 'm sorry , I thought you were Rosenthal . Rosenthal 's a DOCTOR IN OUR OUTFIT . " College Joe type with a grin . Back to bed , my boy , the world will run very well without you , or very badly ; in any case , without you . An angular girl , with hairy legs , pumped decorously past on her bicycle . It was Schatzi in transvestite disguise  --  of course it was not , but Schild , too , could be permitted an error of identification . In the past three days he had seen Schatzi in every bony face ; he had recognized him falsely with greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only becausethe genuine article never appeared in daylight that the apparitions could be ignored . The real Schatzi  --  he had left him an hour before Lichenko had come to the party . Certainly if he , Schild , were Schatzi , he would not fail to trace a connection between these events , to draw up the disjunctive proposition so favored by his courier : either . . . or ; either Schatzi knew of Lichenko or he did not . If he knew , there could be no doubt that what had happened was with his connivance . If he did not , all the rules commanded thatp113he be told . But this clause was the emergency measure , necessarynow because he had ignored the first principle of the code : never to get into such a situation . Thus to obey the second was to admit a transgression of the first , and Schatzi already suspectedhim  --  or pretended to ; in practical effects there was no important difference between reality and appearance  --  of mishandlinghis contact with the 1209th , either foolishly or from a motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lichenko had been planted on him  --  had they nothing better to do than keep him under surveillance ? It was a preposterous idea . Still , since that first morning Lichenkohad been sullen and unresponsive , lurking in the bathroomwhen Schild was home and going through his belongings when he was away : a pair of OD socks left separate in the footlockertray had been united in a neat ball some time between breakfast and lunch . Fortunately , Schild had long been in the habit of destroying his letters  --  not that he received many ; he had luckily cut off from Waslow when he went underground , Waslow who was not long afterwards expelled as an infantile leftist when he resisted the change of line from hard to soft vis-a-vis the bourgeois democracies ; but he occasionally got communications from his sister , who typically had not only again changed husbands but again swapped gods , with the end of the war conceiving a perverse attraction towards the doctrine of Jung , whom she suggested Nathan visit , as long as he was stationedin Germany . Jung , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chessboard . His visible emotions while playing could only be called ferocious ; he groaned cavernously at momentary setbacks , howled at each little triumph , and upon the general victory  --  which he was never long in gaining , for Schild was not only an inferior player at best but would have been almost afraid in these circumstances to be a good one  --  Lichenko became most invidious , arrogantly shov/ing the board across the table like a dirty cafeteria plate and rising to swagger about the room on hard heels . Lichenko 's larger game was surely something more than chess , and unpleasant as it was to think that in this , too , they were adversaries , to that degree the mind would not accept another possibility . As to the heart : it could not endure a second enemy among the two men with whom he held a common purpose . Whatever Lichenko 's menace , Schild forgave him for it . Why should a citizen of the United States of America be a Communist ? , thought Lichenko , all itchy again , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt large lice loping on his back . Off came the tunic . Spine presented to mirror . Not a beast in view . Imagination . They would leave that final place when he next wore a civilian shirt , even a dirty civilian shirt , even a lice-infested civilian shirt . Did the old holy men really wear hairshirts ? What then was their lie ? Surely a truth was what you gave for it . Yet everyone , and from what he could see , particularly the big-spenders of belief , had their lie . Believe in very little , said his mother , and your disappointments will be as small . This had seemed funny to him when he was ten but had grown more grave with age . Old people know more than they can tell directly . His mother then had not been old in years , but some people are born old . He had seen many a baby of whom , if you squinted your eyes , you could get a picture as an old man with cap and pipe , taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom , the German woman moved correctly down the hall , as if on little wheels . Sluts walk so , being so large between the legs that their organs would fall out if they took long steps . You see ! he grinned silently at her back , there 's no need to be so grand ! Next time you pass , Vasya 's fingers will pinch your bottom ! He had never , in his belly , believed in the existence of foreign Communists  --  Communists where the Bolsheviks were not inp115power ? No sense to that . Besides , foreign comrades were not taken seriously even by Soviet Party members , as he knew from his brother . The largest Party outside the USSR , the German C.P. , had been puffed out like a match when Hitler arrived . And as to the Americans , hahaha ! Who already owning an automobile , a ten-room apartment , a motion-picture projector , short-wave radio , and probably an airplane , became a Communist ? Lichenko knew so much about America , had had so many fantasies about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rather owed his data to the Soviet news agency 's New York correspondent , whose dispatches he of course translated in reverse . Thus : the American worker lived like an emperor , and there was no U.S. Communist Party . Since moving into Schild 's billet Lichenko suspected he had been wrong about the latter . After all , the Bolsheviks had not always held power in his own country ; everything started somewhere ; if necessary , before one 's own birth . The old czars , he believed despite his mother 's testimony to the contrary , had not been first-rate people . The last one , he understood despite the Bolsheviks ' like opinion , had no culture and was ruled by a woman herself the instrument of a corrupt monk . Therefore the Communists : who had begun as a small , weak band of , he supposed , idealists and martyrs  --  except that Stalin , even that early , committed armed robbery for the furtherance of his ideals ; and no sooner had they kicked out the czar and won the Revolution than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Perhaps there could be American Communists , for Nathan Schild seemed to be one : who else would consistently praise the Soviet Union while finding fault with his own country ? A normal man bragged of his motherland even if he detested its superstructure , as did Lichenko , because there was a personal pride that took no account of politics . And some of the things Schild claimed to believe : that the Moscow treason trials were genuinep116trials and concerned with real treason  --  he was either a lunatic or a Communist . More likely , both . For what Lichenko would never believe was that a gentle , generous , sweet man like Nathan could , in his right mind , give allegiance to a pack of murderers . On the counselof his affection for him , then  --  the heart does not lie  --  he did not abandon his plan to defect to the West , but added to it a finer purpose : he would also save Nathan . It would be a finer game now , with rewards or disasters of greater magnitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vasya to choose as cover the one Communist in a division of Americans !  --  contributed to his courage . Back in the room , he thought he might permit himself another tubbing . Immersed , he could cogitate better than in the liberty of the bedroom . He still had no concrete plan . Time grew no longer . The NKVD would have had his name for three days ; perhaps they had already traced him as far as the house party . And as yet he had not found the propitious moment to begin his labor of truth and love with Nathan . The trouble was , these considerationsmade for anxiety , which was assuaged only in the bathtub 's warm wet trough . But he could not go now . There , he saw from behind the curtains , came Nathan with lunch , and an excellent lunch it was , although Nathan never gave it any importance . Indifference to the material conditions of life must be unique with American Communists . Certainly it was unknown to the Russian Party ! This handsome house , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lichenko knelt and worked out a cigarette butt embedded in a bedside circle of rug mangy with other burns . The Red Army destroyed many things but nothing that could be put to use . However , reason was a crime for which no American would ever be shot . Was it a matter of distance ? Three thousand miles away . You could talk all you wanted about the universal force ofp117gravity , the iron ball and the feather dropped from the same height hitting the ground together . Just try it : by the time the feather comes to rest the iron will be a ball of rust . So with an elephant and an ant . Density , not volume and weight . So with an American ; try as you may to drop him , it will be a launching . Lichenko had been a mediocre student of physics in the Kharkov technical school and insensible at the time to its multifold uses.  |p118ON  HIS way to work the morning after the party , Reinhart strolled down Very 's way . An irregular blob of olive-drab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , but as it came towards him on the sidewalk he saw it was not Very but her antithesis : the lieutenant who took in drunken Russians . He was rather shorter than the evening before and indefinably seedy , with dust on his glasses ; yet he had a more assured address , hard and bright . He was the kind of Jew before whom Reinhart felt very vulnerable , as if somewhere back he had done him a dirtiness which he , himself , did not remember but the Jew never forgot . He felt this while knowing it was not true , for not only had he not done them wrong : he had never done them anything one way or the other . None of his best friends were Jews . The species was unknown in his home town , which had no foreigners  --  just another reason for its unspeakable dreariness . At college there were some , who had their own fraternityand seemed to go around en bloc , occasionally sitting next to one in classes , where they were usually witty and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either remarkably beautifulor characteristically ugly , never plain , and it was a pity the lovely ones were off-limits  --  there had been a girl , forever enrolledon his list of classics , with sable hair , alabaster nose , cheeks of white iris , and an exquisite name , Esther Rosewater , which he used to say underbreath when she passed oblivious , Esther Rosewater , how I love you , Esther Rosewater ; she made him weak in the knees , and never knew it . For that was the other thing about Jews ; when they were n't eying you with suspicion , they never saw you at all.  |p119As  to this lieutenant , Reinhart thought : I could break him in two . At the same time , he was vaguely afraid of him . Badly returning Reinhart 's salute  --  his fingertips not quite making it to the inferior rim of his spectacles  --  the lieutenant referred briefly to their mission of the night before . He had found upon awakening that Miss Leary had dropped a comb in his rooms , and he had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her property and women care about such things , do n't they ? , smiling in the condescending conspiracy of the males . He could have been lying . Reinhart , who was unusually observant , remembered no loss . Yet losses remembered are hardly losses ; moreover , an officer , unlike a noncom , had little reason to dissemble in courting a nurse . " Was Miss Leary in ? " " No , I left it with her roommate . " " What 's her name , by the way ? " But Schild did n't know and cared enough only to ask : " Do n't you know ? Is n't Lieutenant Leary your girl ? " Reinhart had a tendency to toss the ball to his superiors , to tell an excess of truth that would confront them with the damningfact of their authority . When he said sorrowfully " How can she be ? " the lieutenant 's response confirmed him . He , the officer , showed not only understanding but sympathy . " I have no objections , certainly . " Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have preferred to leave while he was ahead , but the lieutenant hung on , walking with him towards the administrationbuilding . " The Russian  --  did he recover all right ? He was a crazy little fellow . Sometimes I think all Russians are mad , or is that Communismin action ? Have you seen what they did in Wannsee ? " He fancied that with his first word the lieutenant had shot an angry look : of course , one 's big mouth had not considered that he might be a Russian Jew . Then , too , he had earlier observedp120that any mention of Russians not obvious praise never sat well with " liberals , " and he would have bet his duffel bag , with all its souvenirs , that his companion belonged to that breed . He had , therefore , found his weakness ; he no longer felt gauche ; he could not help falling before the temptation . " No one who has n't seen them would believe what a bunch of dirty tramps the Russians are . When we came in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were slave laborers for the Germans , and then service forces , maybe . But no , they were the cream of the combat troops . " He saw pure hate through the lieutenant 's glasses  --  or was it agony ?  --  the eyes were all watery . The hell with him . He was not an officer in the 1209th , and you could n't be court-martialed for an honest description of what you , and no doubt he as well , had seen . Everyone had his own chauvinism , the sacred affiliation that he would not suffer to be questioned , let alone criticized . And how disgustingly stupid , for , in this case , was it not their very uncouthness that made the Russians ' victory all the more remarkable ? So he said something to that effect , but even then the lieutenant'smanner did not improve , and since by that time they had arrived in the front hall of headquarters , they parted coolly , no salute being necessary under a roof . " Goot morning , a very nice day ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , messy desk against the forward wall , except that it was not messy but rather a place of truly stacked papers , dustless , and with a little bouquet of yellow pansies in a jam jar . On his own desk , similarly impeccable , was a pink rose . She was already flying her own colors . " You are surprised , yes ? " Right , but his habit was never to show it . He thought , for the first time , that she might be uncomfortable to have around . She arose and came towards him , the thick sweater , unbuttoned , swaying in its two parts equivalent to the braids.  | " You see , I work for no payment until the opplication is officially opproved . But I also can not eat at the mess until that time . Perhaps you can bring me somesing at lunchtime . " Reinhart tucked his cap under the belt and drifted into his chair . " What age did you put down ? " " Eighteen . " " And they believed it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years a lie ! " Sixteen  --  even those tender years seemed too many , but they did put her under the wire . Through her sweater halves he saw soft little breasts , very round , under the crocheted shirt . She was the kind of girl who in a movie would be asked by the hero , do you really need those glasses ? No , she would say and fling them away forever . But Reinhart rather liked spectacles on a pretty girl ; they were vulnerable-making , sexy . " Let 's see now , what can we find for you to do ? " He fished through the desk drawers , coming first upon the last letter from Di , which when he had put it away yesterday , having finished the answer , was open , with its envelope paperclipped to the back . Now the former was inserted in the latter , as if it had just arrived ; for a moment , until he saw the slit in the envelope top , he thought it had : the outside of all her letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bright-purple ink in the returnaddressspace . Ah well , Trudchen had made it neat , which reminded him to write the customary " Ans. " and the date on the face of the envelope . He reached for the fountain pen habitually kept in the righthand corner of the central drawer , and felt nothing . Nor was it elsewhere in the desk or in his pocket , and Trudchen had not seen it when she policed up . The loss was serious . What with the black market , the PX stock of pens was exhausted , and it was not seemly to sign correspondence with a pencil . Reinhart felt an ill mood come down over him like a sack . The worst thing was that he could not , withp122depressed senses , find any work for Trudchen . The map of Berlin , on which she could have been employed to trace a route for the tour of the Nazi ruins , had also vanished . And he dreaded the coming of Pound , whom he had not told of their new employee , for the excellent reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if his nerves had created him prematurely , for it was only eleven o'clock , he heard Pound 's footsteps in the hall . " Quick ! " he said to Trudchen , " start straightening out those boxes . " He pointed , without looking , to the chaos in front of the closet , and grabbing a fistful of papers from his now-tidy " out " basket , fell on them with knitted brow and deliberative forefinger . Pound sounded two feet from the door when Reinhart realized that Trudchen had moved not to the ordered task but rather closer to him . She had removed her sweater and was flexing her arms in a most provocative , catlike manner , her pink shirt everywherein undulation . " What are you doing ! " ' he said furiously . " But you see , already I have arranged those boxes this morning before you arrived . " How irrefutably true , now that the eyes were turned in that direction : rank on rank , they pyramided almost to the ceiling , with not a loose paper showing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have done all that in a week , but there they were . And here also was  --  not Pound . The liberal lieutenant , with an ingratiating smile , stood in the doorway . " Too bad I did n't know when we came in that you were the fellow , " he said . " For what ? " Reinhart stood up . " Yes , and here they are . " The lieutenant pulled a box from the left slope of the pyramid , weakening the whole organization so that if Trudchen had not sprung to the gap the work of her morning would have been at naught.  | " You must replace that at once ! " she shouted , and the lieutenant , walking from the pile with his box , showed her a look he might have given some vermin too ripe to crush . Christ , did n't he even know the simple principles of stress and strain ? thought Reinhart , whose height permitted him to get the topmost carton and fill the hole . " Okay , this one is small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detail over for the rest . " He was halfway to the door when Reinhart , standing high and wide , blocked the route . " I 'm afraid , sir , that you 'll have to tell me what this is all about . " He weighted the title with deliberate provocation  --  for one thing , because he was wholly in the right ; for another , to break the officer 's damnable insolence . For a moment , and for all his natural , seedy weakness and his fake amenity , the lieutenant 's eyes were hostile . " Get out of my way  --  " This at once calm , masterful , and most persuasive , and Reinhart would have complied had not Trudchenrushed up desperately to add her small person to the barrier . Not even the lieutenant could resist this preposterous event . He smiled , albeit in somewhat ill grace , and set his box on the floor . " Schild is my name , Army Intelligence . Would you like a re-ceipt ? " No wonder now at his sang-froid . Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , far grander , because includingbrains , than even the paratroops , Rangers , or fighter squadrons : keen , intrepid operators in the very camp of the enemy , many-faced , anonymous ; if caught , standing before the wall with a contemptuous smirk towards the rifles ; if successful , only the gratification of knowing oneself supreme ; no vulgar show , whatever medals were due must wait perhaps ten years hence , and perhaps not even then , for the secrets of the bureau can never be revealed . " I 'm sorry , " said Reinhart with a mouth of contrition . " Youp124see , I did n't understand . I could n't just let anyone take these things in the absence of Lieutenant Pound . He 's in charge here . Actually I do n't care about the stuff at all , and neither does he . What is it , or are we allowed to ask ? " Intelligence . No sooner had he got in the medics on his own request than Reinhart sought to escape . It was humiliating to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He even knew German , or enough for a start anyway , the rest he could pick up quickly in a training program . Psychologically he had probably all his life been a kind of undercover agent . In high school he used to follow certain girls in their Friday-evening walks , trail them from nine to midnight , at a distance , in and out of candy-store doorways , and , with the aid of evergreen bushes , right to their front steps , all unbeknownst to them , sometimes forever , sometimes only until the next morning 's study-hall revelation . Intelligence . Its operations turned out to be very secret indeed ; in three years of service he had never so much as learned where to apply . " Just routine correspondence of some German agency , I should think , " said Lieutenant Schild , staring grimly at Trudchen , who kept leaning into Reinhart and kept getting pushed away . " It 's pretty tedious to have to go through it , but we must . " Trudchen leaned against Reinhart again and said , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vait for Lieutenant Pound ! " " Truchen , I want you to do something for me . Go over and sit in that chair behind my desk and schweigen Sie " " Vy so formal ? " she asked pouting , but did it . Just as he had hoped , Schild 's interest was caught . " You are fluent ? " " Not really , but I have enough for a good base . I 'd like to have an opportunity to brush up my German . " Schild leaned close and said in an undertone , jerking histhumb towards Trudchen : " Where did you get that little tot ? " For a moment Reinhart thought : oh , but she 's not that young ;  |p125then  he realized that what Schild had said , in his Eastern accent , was " tart , " a term out of old plays , meaning " whore " or thereabouts , perhaps not so strong ; what he always saw when he read it was a circular piece of pastry with strawberry jam in the center , and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was Trudchen all right . Yet he was responsible for her , in a way , and although it was funny it was also nasty . His remonstrance was lost before he found it , for Schild , very certain , proceeded . " Take my word and get rid of her before she gets you in trouble . " " But she 's just a kid ! " He said it too loud and dared not look towards her . " I swear I have n't touched her , Lieutenant , I have n't even thought of her in that way  --  " " Do n't be foolish , " said Schild , sharply , " I 'm not concerned about her welfare but yours . " So he had made an impression on him ! Reinhart was almost ready to say : I 'll trade Trudchen for a transfer to Intelligence ; perhaps now the war was over , some of Schild 's men would go home on points and there would be openings . " She was peddling her little ass up and down the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that fat  --  , well , it 's better not to say . . . . One of these days she 'll turn up pregnant and I do n't think you 'll want to be made the goat . " Hurt , Reinhart grunted thanks ; the lieutenant clearly thought him naivete incarnate ; the trouble was , his complexion was too fair , there were no shadows on his face , no lines of character , and his eyes being pale blue looked stupid ; he had labored his life long under the prejudice of his appearance . He was like a big , bland baseball bat ; Schild on the other hand resembled a pair of scissors , ugly , black , incisive . How he envied him , even to the tarnish on his silver bar , the dried fog at the edge of his glasses , and the bulge in the flyfront of his ETO jacket that be/trayed an undone button . And , as he watched him leave , perhaps even his dirty mind , which was a symbol of freedom . A sob from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity . " What are you doing ! " She was crying , had her spectacles off for that purpose , was flushed and dripping , and presented so much misery that , despite himself , he gave her his olive-drab handkerchief , which luckily was clean . " He has told you somesing evil about me , that  --  " Whatever followed went into the handkerchief . One braid had got twisted about her neck like a noose , and Reinhart , leaning across the desk , returned it to order . The flushed face came briefly out of the cloth to say " Sank you . " " Trudchen , where were you last night ? " " Wiss my cousin Lori in her cellar . This is all the place we have to live , in a cellar which is all cold and wet and without light . The dampness comes into one 's bones and most nights one can not sleep because of the pain . . . " Suddenly arthritic and conscious that the sun had some momentsbefore left the big window , he sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently , " I mean earlier , before you went to bed  --  were you in this area last evening ? " " Most absolutely n  --  " She started to speak into the handkerchiefbut emerged to study him narrowly . " You wo n't think that I must be a foolish or superstitious person ? . . . I consulted with your priest . " Priest . By chance he knew that the Catholic priest of the 1209th was away on leave to Rome ; his assistant , Joe Para , who was one of Tom Riley 's roommates across the hall , had taken a shower that morning in Reinhart 's bathroom . Yet there was surely an unintentional error here . " Well , then , " said Trudchen when he explained , " this was the Protestant priest , a very large man , do you know him ? "  |p127Of  course , Schild 's " fat  --  " ; things were linking up in sweet reason . " I wished to see him for guidance , " she went on . " I am alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all so confusing . Do you believe in God ? " " I have n't made my mind up , " said Reinhart . " But I do n't hold anything against someone who does . " It were cruel , if Chaplain Peggott gave her comfort , to abuse that great , grinning , flabby sententious ass , and it certainly had nothing to do with God , who if He existed at all , Reinhart was sure , was an It rather than a He and altogether neutral . As for himself , who had been as infant a Lutheran and then , when a schism developed within that congregation over whether or not the Ladies Aid should amortize the church mortgage by serving public suppers and his parents left with the progressive element , a Presbyterian . He believed that Protestantism was deadly mediocrity , Catholicism weak-minded , and Judaism alien  --  and all harmless . He was incapable of bigotry , on the ground that it was a massive bore  --  like the convictions from which it sprang . On the other hand , if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advance his cause the believer was willing to destroy himself rather than other people : gone this far , it was , as with a Joan of Arc , a heroism to which the original motive was irrelevant . Gertrud of Berlin  --  it was scandalous to be with the force which compelled a small girl towards martyrdom . " Look , I 'll see if I can get you a better place to live . I think they have rooms around this area for civilian employees , maybe right in this building , God knows there 's room enough . " He revolvedhis head in disgust at a vision of a thousand rooms unoccupiedwhile girls slept in wet cellars . " And for Lori , too . " " Oh , but there is a reason that she can not , " said Trudchen , and immediately began again to weep softly . " But your priest is not a good man . He tried to have his vay viss me . " She reached to Reinhart 's hand . " He touched me  --  here . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though the illustrationwas clear , kept it there infinitely . " ' I just must see if you are wearing your medal , ' he said . But perhaps it slipped down . ' And then , so quick as one could think of it , he  --  " In the quicknessshe described , Trudchen had stretched open the neck of her shirt and inserted Reinhart 's hand on the bare skin underneath . " Nair is it ? ' he asked , with a very horrible smile . This must be it  --  ' " Withdrawing so swiftly that he unraveled a strand of pink crochet , he shouted : " It 's a lie , Trudchen , it 's a contemptible lie ! " Piggy Peggott  --  he had many sins , but they were of another kind of gluttony : he was famous in the officers ' mess for seconds , thirds , and fourths ; but all one had to do was look at him to see that somewhere back home he had the inevitable preacher'swife in dowdy , unkempt clothing and disorderly hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of definition . Not to mention that : " Protestants do n't wear medals ! " If she had earlier cried in soft self-pity , she howled now in the most violent hatred , her face red and ugly , swinish . " It vas this Jew who turned your feelings against me ! " He felt himself tremble fearfully , thought for a second that he had hit her ; indeed , his big hand hung tremulously in the air between them as if it had bounced there off her small face . But it had not  --  at the instant it would have struck , the fist had been seized by the mind , for Trudchen , in her temper , was not silent . " They have no respect . Of course none of this did happen , but that was what he told you , was it not ?  --  only he made me the bad person , that dirty , filthy creature , that foul  --  " " Do n't say it , Trudchen , it simply is not said . He must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to admit that there are German girls who might  --  well , anyway , it had nothing to do with his being of the Hebrew faith . "  | " But it does have something to be connected to that I am a German . At least for him it does . Because the Nazis do not like the Jews , I am made to suffer . In 1933 I am four yearss old ; in 1938 , nine yearss . They did not permit children to operate the concentration camps . " Reinhart had a weakness in the small of his back , which standing up did not relieve . He wished be had a grievance ; being without one in the modern world was disabling . How gratifying to be the lowliest Negro in Alabama , with no person alive who was not in your debt . How satisfying to be a Jew , with a twothousand-yearclaim or , now , a German who had got his medicineunjustly . He should have been in combat and had his foot shot off , so that when he was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : obviously , I can do nothing about it , I ca n't even walk . He produced a roll of peppermint Lifesavers and , thumbnailingback the tinfoil , offered the first segment to Trudchen . Shortly it could be heard clicking against her little rabbit-teeth . " This is very sweet and not at all  --  what do you say ? " " Hot , ' I guess . " " It is not so hot ' ? But that means no good , ' yes ? That is not what I mean . I like it better than ours , which are more  --  " " ' Hot . ' That 's another usage  --  the word is good for almost anything . " Such as her face , which now , with glossy lines of tear , was cooling . He should have liked to stroke it . She was so helpless , yet at the same time , if that were possible , indomitable . It was the same combination of contraries he had seen in Lieutenant Schild . In the afternoon a PFC sent by Schild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdens and many trips . Pound slopped in at two o'clock , looking for his sunglasses , which after a moment 's search he remembered he had sold , listened to Rein/hart 's explanation of Trudchen and account of Schild 's mission , saying to the first , " Why not ? " and to the second , " Good deal , " punched Reinhart in the belly , and left at two-ten . Neither Lovett nor Nader was in their office , owing , Reinhart assumed , to the catastrophic finale to the party ; the colonel no doubt was grinding them into powder . About which even if he had liked them Reinhart would have felt rather more pleasure than pain , he being an enlisted man to the core . Since , then , official authority could not be consulted , he prowled through the empty rooms in the furthermost reaches of his own wing and found a little closetlike chamber that would meet Trudchen 's want . It was already outfitted with a tiny stove and a naked steel bedstead and spring ; from the 1209th supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sergeant in charge . Delighted , Trudchen threw her arms about him when she saw the new quarters . " Do you need some help to get your things from Lori 's ? " " Oh no , you must not bother ! " A brief crease flew through herclear brow . " I have almost nothing . You will not go there ? " " Not if you do n't want me to . " " Ah , not I. But Lori would be aimborrossed . " " By the way , did she get her job ? " Trudchen showed a sly look . " Do you know , she did not tell me ! She is a very odd human being . One must accustom oneself to her strangeness , but she is very nice . " Leaving her there , he returned to the office . Four o'clock . The PFC had disappeared , after having taken away all of three cartons . On the point of calling it a day , himself , he saw the heavy sweater that Trudchen had left behind . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , either by the window or some secret back door off the hall , whose existence he knew not of . Folding the sweater , with a view to placing it on the bed , he felt a hard , cylindrical object somewhere in the weave . It wasp131his missing pen , along the bottom seam of a pocket . So funny : she could hardly have stolen it and then permitted so simple a discovery . Must , rather , first have borrowed and then retained in a slip of the hand . Yet if he reclaimed it now , she might remember , look , find it again with him , think he had caught her in a theft but for reasons of his own would not protest , be discomfited . He placed the sweater on her pillow and left . He was inclined to visit Veronica , but rather than search the hospital building for her ward , which in his imagination had acquired a sinister aura , he strolled again down the street of her billet on the chance that her duty , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass of the front door ; on the inside surface an unseen agency , swift and sure , manipulated a cleaning rag . Its movements were mesmerizing ; he had an impulse to throw himself on the grass and watch it as the warm-cool late afternoon relaxed into calm evening . Beside the door grew a bush bearing round , white berries like small versions of those pure-sugar jawbreakers with a nut in the center . There was a bush like that in his parents ' front yard , and next to it a weeping willow high in which he had once established an outpost for General Custer . Alone among the men of the 1209th he had been in no hurry to get back to the States , had in fact long planned to ask , in rakish defiance , for permanent assignment to the Occupation forces , was waiting only until it could be more than an empty , sour-grape gesture  --  for , without combat points , he was more or less permanent as it stood . Now , just now , watching the rag fly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the sudden , almost unbearably dear smell of grass  --  he had not at first marked that the lawn was newly cut  --  he ached for home . The door opened just as the general bliss had given into the deadly specificities . He had come far since his first year in the Army when he frequently had such seizures ; yes , he had enlisted to escape , but there was forever another present to flee from ; inp132the summertime , especially , one craved elsewhere . But he had nothing to get back to . In the most literal sense : already in September 1943 his parents had let his room to a man who worked an electric drill in the local defense plant , a man who had remained , had settled down , who surely had dispensed with the arrowhead collection and the stuffed bass 's head on the bookcase . And college : he simply could not face that again after three years of the expansive life . The door had opened and a figure in head-handkerchief and apron came onto the step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not unreasonable , since he had , after all , fallen on the lawn  --  an event thus called to his own attention . The person was Lori . " No , I 'm quite well , " he said in German . " It is pleasant to sit here . I see you have your job , come tell me about it . Sit down here with me . " " I can not sit on the grass ! " she said incredulously . " I am the maid . " At any rate , if she looked no happier now , she was no sadder . Since he was on their level , he noticed that her legs , though dressed in coarse cotton , were finely turned and rather long for her height . But there was also something terribly competent in her appearance now that she wore working clothes , a hint of hard strength that reminded him of his suspicions . " There were no difficulties about the Fragebogen ? " " What you wish to ask is whether I was a Nazi , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans . . . . There was no such thing as a Nazi  --  you should know that if you have asked any other Germans . In all this great country there were no Nazis ; not even Hitler , as you would hear if you could find him . " He sat up , aghast at her change from suppliance to this arrogantself-possession . It was the famous German alternation from serf to lord , no doubt , and he felt it cruelly there on the fresh grass.  |p133Getting  to his feet , he said braggingly in English : " What the hell do I care ? " " Bitte ? " " Mit mir macht es nichts . " " I know , " she said . " That is why  --  " She took a deep breath and suddenly finished it in English : "  --  I love you . " You could n't stay angry when that was said to you , but you could look insane . " Have I said something wrong ? " She took off her dusting cap , and a wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do not know English , " he said in a voice full of augury  --  as if he were to go on with : you can say awful things in it . " What you mean is that you like me . " " It is not the same as in French ? " " I think not . " " Also . " In the distance he heard a laugh like a great bronze chime . Unmistakable . He felt criminally that he did n't wish Very to see him with this girl . But Lori , too , had heard and was even more anxious to flee from him . " There comes one of my mistresses , " she whispered , already in backward motion . " I must go . " " Veronica Leary ? Lieutenant Leary ? " " I do not know the name , but the laugh can not be mistaken . " It was heard again , turning the corner only a few yards away , and Reinhart audaciously pushed into the house after Lori . " Ah , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked in confusion . " I 'm going into the kitchen . " And so he did , and sat silently until Very and what sounded like a roommate entered the door and went upstairs . " Where is Miss Leary 's room  --  the laughing one ? " he whispered.  |p134In  frightful wonder Lori answered : " In the rear . You will go there ? " " Certainly not . Then I can leave by the front and she wo n't see me out the window . " But instead of moving on that plan , he looked at Lori and said : " You 've washed your hair . It is very schon " " Thank you . I did n't have any soap until I started this work . ... But please go now . " Did n't have any soap  --  he was terribly touched by that fact . One thought of the bombings and fires and loss of loved ones , the Gottcrdammerung , but not to be able to wash your socks or bathe , that was degrading and mean . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet cellar . Let me get you a better place  --  " " All right , but now you must go . " She took his hand in her small but very strong one and pulled him from the chair . " Tonight , as soon as you leave work , we 'll get you a new room . I wo n't leave now until you promise . " " Ach , was kann ich tune ' she breathed in despair . " I can not . " " Why not ? " He tightened his hand on hers . " For reasons too long to explain now  --  " " Promise ! After work . What time do you finish ? " " Ah , what can I do ? " she repeated . " I 'll lose my job if you do not go . " " Come with me ! " Now it was he who impelled her , through the hall to the foot of the stair . " Hey Very , are you decent ? " he shouted in a tremendous voice which agitated a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his large friend appeared at the top , blooming lavishly in a powder-blue dressing gown , a dea ex machina about to catch the next elevator down from Olympus . " Kiddy ! " she screamed jovially . " Did you break in here to violate me ? You-all ai n't supposed to be in nurses ' quarters ! " " That 's what your maid insisted . "  | " Well , get out then , you fiend . I 'll see you after chow  --  outside . " " I ca n't , I 've got ta work tonight . " He turned to Lori , who looked very grave , and said as quickly as he could in German : " Unless you meet me this evening I shall cause you trouble . What time ? " " Urn sechs Uhr . I eat at your mess after the soldiers are finished . " She turned away in shame . " Okay then , " shouted Very . " Do n't go away mad . Hey , where did you learn German ? Wait a minute . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pitched it downstairs , it taking the air like a parachute and falling to rest at Lori 's feet . " Would you tell her to press it and be careful not to use too hot an iron ? " Which he did , adding : " Urn sechs Uhr , outside the mess tent . " Chow was SOS , shit-on-a-shingle , ground beef and gravy slopped across a slice of bread , diced carrots and canned peas , rice pudding filled with raisins resembling dead flies . Reinhart ate a grimacing spoonful of each and then smoked two consecutivecigarettes , his only pleasure the dropping of their butts into the swill . " Anyone ever tell you you eat like a goat ? " he asked Marsala , who was stuffing down seconds . " I 've got a right to , I worked all day , " his roommate answered on a rising , plaintive note , missing the point . At the garbage cans were two small boys who had temporarily ducked the guard . As Reinhart prepared to empty his full messkit , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , with a spoon flipped out the cigarette-ends , poured the contents in a tin with jagged rim , and began ravenously to feed . Marsala pushed his boy roughly aside . " Go on , you goddam Krauthead . " But there was nothing in his kit but three drops of gravy , and when the guard appeared , sweating and worried , withp136his switch at the ready , Marsala stared into his bland face and threatened : " Go on , you fuck , or I 'll take ya apart . How do you like that , " he went on to Reinhart , " those kids belong to his own country . " " Well , we hired him to keep them away . " " Yeah , but who would really do it except a German ? " Their natural anarchism saved Italians . They were , after all , the original fascists , but even Mussolini had inspired more laughter than hatred . Someone should take the guard aside and say : Sit down , Hans , have a smoke . Now I 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and abstractionshave almost no worth at all . When you get an order your sole responsibility is to act as if you are carrying it out . Hypocrisy is the better part of competence . It is foolish , I know , and defies everything you and I were taught ; but in the degree to which you serve others and not yourself , the others will forsake you . However , comprehending neither Marsala 's threat nor Reinhart'sinterior monologue , " Hans " had driven the children out of range , lashing their meager shins in the most dispassionate manner . Reinhart had delayed taking his meal , and Marsala with him , until the tent was almost empty of soldiers and the queue of civilian workers had begun to form at the front flap , and en route to and at the apartment he dawdled for twenty minutes , part of which was aimed to bore Marsala with his company . It worked : the buddy at last drifted across the hall to needle Riley , and Reinhart returned to the mess area . Almost too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the curb . He spotted Lori , carrying a small , lidded pail , about to mount a tailgate . " Also , Sie Sind falsch ! " he accused . " I looked for you , " she stoically replied . " I have either to ride this truck or walk many kilometers . " Within , the side benches were loaded with women who gave off chattering to stare at Reinhart.  | " Go on . " He lifted her up in one strong action , getting on his jacket a bit of splash as the cover jarred from her can , and vaulted himself in with a terrible noise on the metal floor . Which prompted the driver to peer through his spy-window and call : " Haul ass , kid . No riders . " " The Lover sent me , Eberhard . I have to get new quarters for this woman . " " Lovett never told me about it . " " All right , all you have to do is tell him when you get back . " " You tell him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the isinglass trapdoor . They had squeezed onto the bench between a very fat girl and a very skinny woman , so that Lori was compressed and Reinhart slashed by sharp elbows . " Tell me now , " he asked . " Why all the strange reactions ? I think you should want to have a better place to live . Trudchen told me this afternoon about your cellar  --  how she could n't sleep there for the wet  --  " " Trudchen ? She does n't live with me ! . . . I warned you about her untruths , but I suppose not enough . She lives with her parentsin a pleasant flat , not bombed , near the hospital . " " And I got her a room in headquarters building ! What game is she playing ? " " That 's just it , you see , a game . She is very young and willful . It is not easy to be an adolescent girl in the present time . " No , he supposed not ; for that matter , it had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and three thousand miles back , in a smooth place where the only craters were excavations for new bungalows . At least Trudchen had no pimples . " And then , too , perhaps her family are not all that could be desired  --  but that 's another story . As to me , well , frankly , I have a husband . " " Oh , that 's all right . You see , I 'm not  --  " He had intended to say : interested in you in that way . But it would have been insulting.  | " He is very strange  --  as now it seems I am helpless to prevent your seeing for yourself . " The truck was under way , clanking , creaking , and in clouds of blue exhaust , which defying the principles was drawn stinking into their compartment . Under cover of his conversation in the other direction , Bony Elbows waxed friendly , cutting her sharp patella into the outer surface of his thigh . She was , he had seen on entering , at least forty-five years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had an odd role . " That was her last word until a half hour later when , after various stops , one of which freed them of Fat and Thin at the same time , the vehicle came to rest at what seemed to him a purely arbitrary point in nowhere and she and he detrucked . They stood before a hill of waste whose farthest margin must have , spilling over Asia 's width , been forever eroding into the Pacific . The sun , elsewhere on this day so rich , voided this dark field , and the sweet air had long ago sold out to its competitor gases . On this range figures thin and slumped roamed crumbling through its Brenners , sack-bearing , searching , genitors of no sound . But on the summit a small girl , a ragged head above a cotton bag , called shrill and disconsolate to nobody below : " Wo is der Heinrich ? " " Behold , " said Lori . " Niirnberger Strasse . " Five minutes ' impossible trek and they teetered on the powderedbrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lighter , but Lori hastily lowered its cap . " There may be escaping gas . " She drew him , now blind , down the prairie-dog way.  |p139ON  me sofa lay an amorphous lump to which was appended a great pale ham . Lori slammed the door . A hollow groan issued from the ham , and two apertures appeared in its wan surface . After a time a mouth revealed itself , as if in one of those motionpicturecartoons where inanimate objects come to life through lines from nowhere , with the breezy implication that humanity is some sleight-of-hand . However , the present process was not flippant , but ponderous and awesome . Lori put down her pail and fired more oil lamps , and in the richer light the great object rose gradually and with tremendous deliberation , like a sinking ship preparing for the final and irrevocableplunge , to an attitude of sitting . " Herr Reinhart , mein Mann , " Lori waved loosely at the hulk . " Sehr angenehm . " The voice was full , sonorous , making a rand thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed to be as large and ripe as purple-black plums honored Reinhart directly and briefly , then shifted within the largesse of lid to Lori , who stood before the table , one hand at the base of a lamp , her left side from flank to hair bright in its refulgence . " Here is your dinner . " He ignored her to revolve his head to Reinhart , saying in English without accent : " Ah , this is your corporal ! " As Reinhart closed on the cold sponginess of the extended hand , he felt with surprise that his own was not being shaken in acquaintance but rather used as a purchase whereby this large figure was lifting itself from the couch , and the weight was such as to compel him to throw his rear feet wide , lest he be toppled forward . " S'il vous plait , " his burden wheezed with difficulty on the wayp140up , and then , all at once , was upright before him , or rather loomingover him , for the man was a good seven feet tall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the , for him , rare feeling of slightness . The pull left the hand , but it stayed clammily and , oddly , weightless , in his own , until he opened his fingers and gravity , not its parent body , moved it to fall slowly away . Using that language , Lori 's man noted that he could speak English , and would , as a courtesy . Swaying a bit , he said that it was all but impossible for him to stay erect , but that he insisted on doing so until his guest was seated . Lori having furnisheda chair , he sank again to the sofa , and drew the dressing gown that was his lone garment more snugly about him . Lying still , pale , and full , like a sack of mozzarella , he tasted of the air with porcine nostrils , and began : " Now we can converse at our ease . My name is Bach , which as you perhaps know , signifies brook ' in German , and , naturally , to every German , and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is to conjure up the image of the master of the Thomasschule and the three most eminent of his twenty offspring  --  forhis loins were apparently as prolific as his brain  --  who were also composers of a high rank , but not quite so well known outside their own land . So far as I know , I am not a descendant of that noble line . And you are called . . . ? " " Reinhart . " " The name , of course , means pure of heart , ' Hart being the Low German variant of Herz . But I have a feeling that you , like so many Americans , have no great interest in etymology . Unfortunately , it is one of my many weaknesses . And I do have more than my share . " He indicated his body with a sweep of the hand . " The main among them being a physical impuissance , if you 'll permit the word , in spite of a monstrous size . This misfortunehas caused my energy to be diverted directly to my brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deniesp141me sleep , occupied as it forever is with a thousand and one theories , ideas , and bits of information which it should like to synthesize . I speak of this brain as if it acts of its own volition , has a life , as it were , of its own . For indeed it seems to have such an independent existence  --  awe-inspiring , to say the least . I  --  it is ridiculous , is it not , to speak of an I ' separate from one 's brain ? but it really seems that way to me  --  I conceive of my own identity as relating more closely to the emotions , for I am their creature and toil under the dominion of the harsh ambassadors they send to the external world , the senses . " Here he snorted : " Smell ! " Poked a pair of spread fingers into his eyes : " Sight ! " Extended a fat , pink tongue , swollen as a bladder : " Taste ! And so on . Do I make myself clear ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten him , then asked , shyly : " I say , do you smoke ? " Reinhart offered the cigarettes , saying , " Please keep them all . I have many . " " Oh , kind , kind . I can not thank you enough . " He seemed about to rise , but decided against it . He dropped a tear . Wiping his nose on his dressing gown of dirty-orange cotton , he reverently chose a cigarette from the pack , called for a light from Lori , and getting it puffed luxuriously , his huge bald skull reflecting light like a mirrored ball upon a lawn . " Now where were we ? Oh yes , I believe some biography may be in order . Perhaps you would like to hear of my term of years in the Orient , where I served as cultural attache in the Embassy in Tokyo . A strange people , the Japanese , rather stolid , in spite of their reputation for wit . Their art is curiously constipated . Nevertheless , it has a kind of mordant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitation and the infinity of nature . But perhaps I 'm doing them an injustice . They have , like all peoples , much to recommend them . Good clear skins , for example ; one never finds them shriveling up in later years , and scrupulouslyclean . Absolutely no odor ! This may owe to their arrivingp142at puberty earlier than we . Our Western pubescence , which , althoughwe think it consonant with some divine ordinance , is the slave of social , rather than natural , imperatives , has certain unpleasant concomitants : the foul stink of perspiration , for example . Children , you will note , never stink , even in the heat of strenuous play . The Japanese , arriving at adulthood still in the vigor of extreme youth , consume the life-stuff in toto , while in us a certain excess accrues which maturates . Your excellent English verb , by the way , expresses beautifully both aspects of this process : the fructification and the rot . Orientals maintain that white men smell like corpses . " The slight movement of Bach 's trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , where Lori stamped it dead , communicated a tremor to his lower extremities ; the robe slipped away , exposing a view of verdigrised leg braces , complex in rods , wires , and articulations . " The Japanese have an unusual poetry , which resists qualitativejudgement . So long as a haiku is written in accordance with the traditional seventeen-syllable form , it is the peer of every other constructed in the past , or to be constructed in the future . If it violates the form , it is not a haiku . A Westerner at his first exposure is nearly driven mad by the question as to whether this is the beginning or the end of art , not to mention morality and history . Of course , this question is of no concern to the Japanese : it simply is , without qualification . They are wise and courageous enough to accept the given . Westerners can approach this knowledgeonly by burlesque , as when the Englishman says the great thing about the Order of the Garter is that no damned merit 's involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , with the lust of a gourmand measuring off the links of a sausage , and developing an amusement which terminated in a high-pressure giggle , half-audible ; the remainder being in the upper , silentdog-whistleranges , where it worked a secret violance on Rein/hart 's nerves , so that forboding ballooned the membranes of his heart as might a seizure of gas . Bach gasped and grunted a tongue which Reinhart took for Japanese . " Let me translate : The snow crowns pale Fuji Here below , it is spring . That is of my own authorship , but it will do . " He spoke Orientally again , in an altered voice . " Chinese . Their verse is considerably different , but I am too exhausted to explore the subtleties of the difference at this time . " Despite his growing nausea , Reinhart asked for a translation . He was determined not to permit this strange man to elude fact , believing that the secret of power lay in its mystery . " Oh , yes , that is Meng Hsien-Wong . Like a shimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late clear air ; Already since the morning rain The blossoms have grown older . So does the pear-branch , snow-perfumed , Hold a bright mirror up to man . " You can see right off that this is not so pure as the haiku , beingcorrupted with morality . You perceived the moral , of course ? " Reinhart did not attend to this bit of malice . He had , at the mention of the " pear-flower , " discovered a primary cause of his illness : the room stank of rotten fruit . " The latter was a tributory verse to an incomparable **26;11390;TOOLONG by Chien Hsuan which I once owned but was confiscated , supposedly for some use in the advancement of the war , but how such an item could be used for such a purpose , I have no idea . "  | " No , Bach , " said Lori , still standing by the table . " You sold it , do n't you remember ? " He narrowed his eyes at Reinhart , and his massive face becamemean , piggish , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners ! We here speak the language of our guest . " " But I have no English , as you know . " Reinhart , working at a piece of gum , felt slightly relieved . He explained that he knew German and suggested that it be spoken for Lori 's benefit . " To be sure , " said Bach , " I am at your command . Yet , I am about to tell you something in confidence . However , I wonder if I dare ? She understood enough of my comments on the paintingto correct me . " " You probably have told the story before , " observed Reinhart , in a schoolmasterish voice . " Of course ! That 's exactly it . " He peered sagely at Reinhart . " You look like quite a decent fellow . Tell me , how many Germanshave you shot ? " Reinhart enjoyed a brief daydream of cutting down rank upon rank of blond men with a Thompson submachine gun . But he lacked in nerve to carry it off . He sheepishly admitted : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uniform . I 'm a medic , a sort of half a soldier . Geneva Convention ... " Bach made the best of it . " An appropriate office for an American , really ; an exemplary role . " With a beatific smile , " A marvelouspeople : one-hundred thirty millions of decent chaps spread out across that strange Siberia . I have been there , of course , so I will not amuse you by asking if you know my friend Smith in New York . " " My home is in Ohio , " said Reinhart , dolefully . " Quite so . Very near Chicago . You see , I do know . I once , with a friend , took a motor trip from that city to Michigan . We passed a number of persons who hailed us with leafy stalks , and felt like Christ entering Jerusalem through the palm branches.  |p145However  , when we were eventually brought to halt by an exceptionallyviolent signal , we were asked to purchase celery . But excuse me for a moment , wo n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help Reinhart had rendered earlier , performed the impressive ritual of rising . By a tottering , brink-of-disaster , Humpty-Dumpty locomotion he arrived at the door , where he leaned briefly against the jamb , while that frail member moaned at the weight , and then went out . The door stood open . His voice boomed in the hall in a cornplaintabout the lack of light , and another door could be heard to open , but not afterwards to close . The rich rush of his water was audible . Lori sat on the edge of the couch , extending both hands in supplication . " I fear he 's been drinking . It 's horribly embarrassing , you must forgive me . " Reinhart was also embarrassed  --  for his own membership in the sex that made noise at the toilet . To cover up , he said , " It 's true , then , that he knows Chinese , and so on . " " Yes , " said Lori , smiling wearily . " For some years he was assistantcurator of Oriental art at the museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for him to show you . He can be very illuminating . But most of our own collection had to be sold and what few things remained went to the incendiary bombs . " " You sold them to pay for his medical treatment ? " " Oh no  --  it is another long story . " " You have so many . " " Yes , life is merely several long stories laid end to end . " She reached across and patted his knee maternally . " They must not trouble you . " Although they should have , at that moment they did not . His distress owed rather to the dreadful odor , which was on the point of laying him low . Life takes precedence over courtesy . Lori shook her head at his apologetic question . " That is one of Bach 's conceits . He read in Eckermann that Schiller was stimu/lated by the aroma of rotting apples . " She opened a drawer in the table . " Voila ! " Exposing , sure enough , three blackened , scabrousfruits . Bach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer be heard . When he reappeared he stated that , having taken the air , he was much refreshed , which claim was supported by his looking a shade stronger on his pins , though still not by any means competent . Reinhart was not sure as to what proportion of Bach 's weaknesscould be attributed to gigantism and what to drink . Indeed , the drunkenness referred to by Lori had taken Reinhart by surprise , for Bach , given his odd body , had not spoken in a way that would have seemed , to Reinhart , out of consonance with it had Bach been sober . At any rate , Bach swayed in , regained the sofa , where now with his new-found strength he sat rather than reclined , and confessed to copious draughts of potato schnapps ; had , in truth , drained the bottle , otherwise he would have offered some to his guest . A pity , grievously hard to get ; for the past few years in Germany , there were few potatoes to eat , let alone drink . He gauged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rapidly clearing . " If you stay with me throughout the period of sobering , you will no doubt see the engine run diminuendo and eventually cough dead , so I had better make the most of what articulate time 's left . " Now I am not unconscious of my failure to ask you of yourself , but your status is not in question . I have reason to believe that the American Intelligence , when it finds time , will be unusually interested in mine . You see in me one whose only engagement for the future is with Judgment Day , for , frankly , I was a National Socialist . " Reinhart straightened in his chair , crossed his legs the other way , tugged at the margin of his jacket , and checked his buttons . How seldom we meet the real thing !  | " It would be silly for me to do anything else , my record being readily available . For I was no more tepid in my political convictionsthan in anything else . In short , if I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish is to tell my story without rancor , without extenuation , and submit myself to your mercy . Will you , as a matter of simple humanity , grant me this favor ? Hier stehe ich  --  " " Only you are reclining , Bach , " interrupted Lori , with a foolish giggle which made Bach frown and even Reinhart to turn his head in impatience . She had brought up another chair when dispossessedof the sofa , and slumped there like a discarded rag doll . " Please , please , " Bach replied in German , " none of your Quatsch . This is a sober affair . " " How can I hide it ? " asked Bach . " What is done is done . Nazism might be defined as an extreme attempt to alter the relations of Jews and gentiles , in the latter 's favor . All the other involvements start from this , and this is one of those sublime simplicities that achieve the miracle of fecundity in reduction , like the Cartesian cogito . It requires the utmost in intellectual courage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or non-Jews ; with anything less , the whole thing collapses into absurdity . " Yes , exactly , you smile . So should have I genuinely , not too many years ago , and so do I now , with the hypocrisy of courtesy , and also with real sympathy , for I can deny myself no indulgence in my present state . But I did not begin life as an anti-Semite . There were no Jews in my birthplace , a small village in Bavaria , and it was not until I entered the Gymnasium at ten years old that I ever saw a Jew , and not until I entered the university that I ever , to my knowledge , heard Jews remarked on in a special way . In short , for many years I thought of Jews as simply Germansof a religious persuasion different from my own . Such hostile attitudes towards the Israelites as I came across fromp148time to time , I believed to be the by-products of doctrinal differencesof the sort that obtain between Catholics and Protestants  --  ofwhich I was thoroughly aware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naive tolerance throughout the university years . A force to support it was my personal status as an aesthete . I avoided the drinking and the fraternal societies and the other nonsense , and consequently did not escape being marked as an odd one . Finding myself in the same category as the Jews , I went so far as to make some friends among their ranks . They were , naturally , excellent scholars , and their scholarship was conditionedwith the sort of finesse that is so sadly lacking among the Germans . In my reaction against Spiessbiirgertum , I shortly becameinfatuated with the Jews , and with their culture . And surely no culture is more attractive to the young man than the Jewish , just as there is no more repugnant than the German . Besides , Orientalism was my pursuit , and the Jew was the earliestflowering of the East . I gradually became aware of the indictmentbrought against my pets by the Germans , in all of its ramifications , but I still was not be moved . Indeed , I became more pro-Jewish than before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I accepted the accusations as truth , taking issue only with the interpretation . That is to say if the charge was that Jews owed allegiance only to their international Jewish state , I agreed and approved . For , thought I , what else could they do , when throughouthistory they have been rejected from the Christian society they sought innocently and sincerely to join ? In the Twenties , as you may know , the Germans were in narrow straits , while the Jews allegedly flourished . Now it took some nerve to hold , as I did , that it was natural and just that they should tighten the screws against the gentile , for would not the latter have done so had the situation been reversed ? I could never see anything peculiarly evil in the Jew 's economic behavior . Should the executionerbe blamed for the practice of hanging ? " As for the arguments on racial grounds , they were sheerp149foolishness , only to be believed in by the kind of people who take up vegetarianism , Rosicrucianism , and other crackbrained schemes to evade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I think this was also true of most convinced anti-Semites , whatever certain loudmouths said . This phase of Nazism was sheer spectacle ; this was the Nazis ' analogy to Christianity 's graven images , saints ' relics , etc. , and a central vulgarity on which Protestants and Catholics could agree . Never since Luther , whose nationalistic fury vis-a-vis Rome withered his sense of psychology , had the national appetite for histrionics been so appeased . " Well , then , in the light of all this , why did I eventually reversemyself and become ineluctably anti-Semitic , even to the extent of joining the National Socialist party , which I had from the first abominated as an unholy alliance of gangsters and buffoons ? I became an anti-Semite , not for the usual reason  --  because of the anti-Semites  --  but because of the Jews , and I joined the united front against the Jews because there was nowhere else to go . " When I emerged from the university into the great world , moved to Berlin and entered its intellectual life  --  which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change my stand . I still baited the anti-Semites , and , as one will when in the grip of a self-righteous obsession , in the absence of suitable adversariesengaged in dialogues with myself , acting first as advocates diaboli in the presentation of the strongest possible case against the Jew , then demolishing it with my better arguments . I would probably never have had cause to change had I kept company only with gentiles , and certainly never , had my associates been anti-Semites . But I found myself in ever-closer relationships with Jews , whom I attracted as my philo-Judaic position became known , and whom I of course sought out . And thus the foundationcame to be built , stone by stone , for the mansion of knowledge . For I found that no matter how well disposed a gentile is towards a Jew it can never be sufficient , for the Jew will notp150stop short of the total debasement of his friends . The Jew does not want , and does not ask for simple understanding . He craves only total victory , and rewards anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Jews to deplore the persecutions they had suffered at Christian hands . In their arrogance they assertedthat this very act of deploring was a form of anti-Semitism because it credited their enemies with efficacy , and no matter how superficially well-intentioned the gentile who entertained such sentiments , he could not avoid unconscious Schadenfreude , no more than can the athlete who sympathizes with the cripple . " This is an excellent example of the Jew 's ability to pursue his end by contradictory means . Sometimes he will object to the very designation of the Jews , ' maintaining that no such racial , cultural , religious , ethnic , or whatnot entity exists , that it is the sheerest invention , the most fantastic lie . If you point out that if this were so , anti-Semitism would also be nonexistent , he will say , " Exactly , that supports my claim that the whole affair is simply the eternal struggle between the mob and the elite , with no relation to Jewishness . " At other times , and under other guises , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other people , because of all the peoples of the earth , only the Jews have been able to preserve their identity in every milieu . He can disclaim Jewish influence on any culture , or assert that the Jew is the Erntihrer of our heritage , and cite Abraham , Moses , and Jesus . Yes , he will cite Jesus with the composure which is his forte ! The modern world is , for him , a theater in which the produces a list of leading performers beside whom the gentiles are relegated to the beer-hall stage : Marx , Freud , Einstein . " He can assume any position at will , for he believes in none . And he hates the sympathizer because sympathy implies melioration , and melioration is change . The Jew 's real aim is to bringp151Time to a stop . Like all Asiatics , he has a horror of motion , process , becoming  --  whatever name you like  --  for us Occidentals , the superior Deity . When is replaces to be , he will have won . Humanitarianism , liberalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as temporal devices to frustrate him , whereas he delights in the antagonism of fanatics . The antiSemiteis his darling , just as the atheist is the theist 's sweetheart , the murderer the victim 's beloved . The Jew would be a god . How near to success is he then when called a devil ! And how he writhes in hatred when a slobbering , mealy-mouthed humanitarianaddresses him as Man ! " Totalitarianism provides his most congenial society , with its stupid calls and alarms , its aping of the Jew 's own tricks , such as the obliteration of time and the fierce attack on moderates , and  --  its persecution of the Jew ! When he becomes an obsession , he is on the threshold of victory . " Bach retracted his big head into layers of neck-flesh , recovered , then began again , right forefinger extended : " I do not mean to claim that I quickly saw the light . Young and innocent as I was , I determined after each rejection to redoublemy efforts at understanding , feeling still that it was our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crabbed , distorted way . How very close was I to the truth ! A human being if thrown into water at birth can swim . A few years of growth and this talent is gone , to be regained only by artifice . Yet , this is as it should be . Artifice is what makes us human . It is morally necessary to withhold this function from a child until he has lived long enough to learn the properties of water and the human body , and to experience a sense of achievement in placing them in a new relationship . So with me . By the heart , I had arrived at the proper relationship with the Jews , the masterlyone , but I was condemned to tread the earth for some years in ignorance before returning to it by ratiocination . " But , to proceed . I told myself again that the Jews had nop152reason to think kindly on their oppressors , and that it was only natural they would out of pride decline any aid that tended to imply a lack of self-competency on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decency , intelligence . They might deny me , but I would not deny them . I suddenly took on , through the force of my commitment , the identity of a Jew ; and the soma reflectedthe psyche : the cartilaginous tissue of my nose thinned , my eyebrows thickened , and my shoulders developed a nervous twinge . " At first , my gentile friends derived much fun from this state of affairs , and would jokingly call upon me for the Jewish point of view on every question ( this " Jewish opinion " is a favorite delusion of gentiles , and one which while ostensibly deploring , Jews enjoy enormously ) . But it did not take long for them to discover that what was an idle jest to them , was deadly serious to me . As my philo-Semitism became firmer and firmer , I felt a wall rising between us . The last brick fell into place when a story began to go around that I was really half-Jewish , and had thrown my lot with the alien part of my heritage . This fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrible fact that I had , in free will , abdicated from the gentile 's estate . " But , of course , neither was I received as a fellow by the Israelites . Here there existed no solid wall  --  this people could not have survived all those agonizing centuries by material means . ( The Jew , by the way , has always deluded his enemies into thinking he is materialistic . Nothing could be farther from the truth , which you can appreciate when you observe that he has flourished in the West under capitalism , a philosophy which above all others is abstract and visionary , and based on the intangiblesof faith and spirit . He is , however , naturally opposed to the recent developments of capitalism . If it becomes humane , that is to say , evolves into true socialism  --  which is absolute materialism  --  we have a chance of conquering him . Vain thought ! )  | " So I was with and around the Jews without being of them . Oh , they do n't hold secret meetings , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is far too gross to be of Jewish origin  --  you know they , themselves , plant ' most of the anti-Semitic fairy tales  --  is an example of the gratuitous aid they are often rendered by moronic gentiles ) , they have no arcane signs or handgrips , no insigne . How they communicate their identity to each other is so mysterious that it exceeds mystery , as does the manner in which a single spermatazoon out of ten thousand penetrates the egg . The important thing is that it happens . And , if we can not grasp it , no Jew can fail to . Which is why no Jew can truly forsake his people , and why the Jews display that odd combination of mockery and pity towards those of their fellows who vainly toy with religious conversions ' and facial surgery . " The great reversal ( from philo- to anti-Semitism ) came , as those things do , all at once . I was in the habit at that time of spending the evenings with my Jews in a cellar-cafe where over a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking art , literature , philosophy , and those other diversions of the young , including politics , of which ours was , in that day  --  1927  --  communism . All in what I cherished , despite numerous disillusionments , as the intimate atmosphere of brotherhood . One evening a newcomer appeared at our table , a fierce , hideous , wooly-headed young Israelite , looking like the pictures one sees of Trotsky as a youth . He was discoursing passionately on some topic , political I should imagine , but as I took a seat , he terminatedabruptly . It 's all right , ' one of the others told him , Bach is all right . ' He nodded amiably at me , and rather transparently began to comment on inconsequential matters . Later , when I had left the table briefly to speak with a friend across the room , I saw on returning that he and Schwartz , whom I regarded , as my closest comrade , had their heads together , snickering . The object of their amusement was obvious . Now , lest you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew 's humor is concerned solely with satire ; he does not laugh at things , but always at people . That is to say , he finds funny not what occurs by chance , such as a stout man 's tumble on the ice , but what has taken place by human will , and the involvements therefrom , such as , say , a gentile posing as a Jew . This temper stems first from the Jews themselves having suffered too much from chance to find comedy in the fortuitous , and , second , from their great reverence for the given , the inanimate , the timeless . One might almost say the Jew would see the ice mocked by the stout man 's hindquarters . " I felt a rush of loathing at that moment , as one about to vomit feels the bile-bitter fluid rise in his throat , and not at the Jews , but at myself . For a moment I had seen in those mirrors of degradation that dreadful , abominable specter that no one call face with composure : my naked self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the deepest self-knowledge bears with it the deepest cowardice . The impulse to action was to come almost an hour later . The conversation had continued in the same silly direction the newcomer had indicated : tastes in wine , the beasts at the Zoo , a job a friend had lately got on one of the Ullsteiu papers  --  B.Z. am Mittag , I believe  --  and so on . Finally , the group began , only half-seriously , to plan an outing in the next week . Half-seriously , I say , because we were all unemployed , and could not have raised the money for the elaborate refreshments listed as the minimum fare . Where shall we go ? ' cried Schwartz . Someone named a favorite section of the Grunewald . The eternal dupe , I had been swept up again into the warmth of the fraternity , and was adding my bit . I noted with good humor that we should avoid the spot named , because on a recent Sunday stroll I had marked that it was uncomfortably crowded . " ' Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I think now that he was merely passing a harmless , if masochistic jest , as Jews often do , but , then , it struck the spot that had been workedp155raw by the earlier incident . I broke down and wept . God , there is nothing more terrible than a young man 's sorrow ! But not even that will move a Jew ! I sprang to my feet . Yes , ' I sobbed , just as here , ' and fled from the cafe . From that moment on , the battle was joined . " I had been a fool , but my greater folly was yet to come . I fell prey to the subtlest device of this devil , and joined the ranks of his greatest ally , the National Socialist Party . " To war on decency , love , truth , freedom , is to permit the Jew to mask himself with the Good , and thus to embrace him . Through our aid , the Jew was able to achieve what in all the anguished millenia before he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his weaklings , while increasing his moral capital with every one we destroyed . We hardened him with our tortures . We tempered him , refined him in our fires , we polished him down to the indestructible core . Today you can see the results of our craftsmanship : he is pure hard diamond , and his radiant leer sparkles in triumph over his fallen forge-slave . " In conclusion Bach reached over and dropped his hand on Reinhart 's knee with a startling weight . Startling because when he had held it earlier in greeting , it was light , and since it was clammy as well , reminiscent of a damp sponge . Now it hit with a plop like a waterlogged sponge , and , sure enough , when Reinhartlooked down he saw a faint wet stain melting the crease from his trouser-knee . This oddity was as full of liquid , it occurredto Reinhart , who remembered both the tears of gratitude at the cigarettes and the weeping in the story , as a cheese is full of " whey " in all the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come across anyone whose hands genuinely dripped with perspiration , it was worthy of cataloguing . Then too , in this damp cellar nothing dried . His own sweat , while not as plentiful as Bach 's , sheathed him like a trout 's mucous envelope . A strip of stagnant water lined the base of the wall ; the concrete blocks above had sieved out a patina of mineral salts.  |p156Bach  's rhetoric had made poor Reinhart 's head reel , from amusement through indignation to logical vertigo . He repeated the process , this time at greater cost , that he had undergone in Philosophy 100 , where the splendid promise of the fall catalogue  --  " Themajor traditions of European thought "  --  was blighted by the inevitable petty-Machiavelli of a lecturer with his cul-de-sacs : " Epimenides , a Cretan , said all Cretans are liars . Was he telling the truth ? " And even if he understood , he was lost , and guilty , guilty . At last , in desperation , he said : " Just let me get hold of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bach made his giggle , and the hairs rose on Reinhart 's neck . " Leave it to the American to put things without equivoca-tion ! " Reinhart took his advantage to steer into the congenial area of behaviorism . " But all this is in terms of feelings and ideas . What exactly did you do , as a Nazi ? " Bach withdrew the sponge to his own knee , his eyes bagging in disappointment . " I should have thought the intellectual history to be the more valuable . Well , then , if you insist , I can produce a few crumbs of physical activity . Humiliating , but perhaps useful as an index to the nightmare from which it took me so long to awaken . " I joined the Party in November , 1938 . I sha n't dwell on the scruples the conquering of which took me an entire decade from the aforementioned events . I placed the button under my lapel a few days before the celebrated Kristallnacht when , in retaliationfor the murder by the Polish Jew Grynszpan of an attache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an action against Jews and Jewish property throughout the Reich . It may sound queer to you that I participated in some of the raids in Berlin . Yes , I the aesthete ! My request for a role was most suspiciouslyreceived , the storm troops being constituted of the most ungodly scum you can imagine , whose motivation was notp157a holy passion against Jews but a simple nihilistic lust for destruction . However , a fanatical eye is an effective persuader . I managed to win a position on one of the flying squads that swooped on the Jewish shops in the Kurfiirstendamm . You cannotunderstand , nor can I describe the exultation with which I plied my axe , even astonishing the thugs whom I accompanied , so that by the end of the night there was a tacit agreement among these canaille that I was their leader . " In a china shop , where we had done a job worthy of your proverbial wild bull and were ready to depart , one of my companionscame upon a hidden safe , buried in the rear wall . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it being impervious to the pick , and I was all for abandoning the project for better work elsewhere . But the cupidity of these swine was aroused ; they were convinced the Jew had cached his treasure there . The door was eventually burst , revealing an empty chamber save for a single object , a small vase , which on examination I determined to be a piece of thirty-pfennig trash from Woolworth 's . " Now why the Jew would have placed such a thing in his vault I could not at first explain , and , indeed , was about to pitch it aside , when the thought struck me that the scoundrel had got intelligence of the raid , and , lacking anything better , had employedthis means of retaliation , with a sense that Nazis of the common stripe would be certain to think it valuable and demonstratetheir idiocy by confiscating it unbroken . A very deep joke , typically Jewish . But I knew , with the penultimate hatred which is , as I now know , stupidity , but which then seemed wisdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable me to top the Jew at his own game . I led my men in another diligent round of razing . When we had done , the showcases were Hinders , the walls demolished to the lath , the woodwork a pile of faggots for the stove , the wiring ripped out  --  in short , a reduction that could have qualified us journeymen house-wreckers . A tinyp158table was spared , and placed in the center of the room . On it , I centered the vase , filled to the rim with my ordure . " For all the foliage , thought Reinhart , he is a clown at the core . " That was sort of childish , was n't it ? " Bach could not be conned . " No , with gratitude , if you mean and therefore not responsible : " And , not seeing Reinhart 's grin grow dim , he struggled to his feet without assistance ; swaying over him , face contorted , arms rising and falling like a crazy windmill , he screamed in the voice of his giggle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , no . Ca n't you understand ? In Auschwitzwe of the SS could kill two thousand head in half an hour , but it was burning the bodies that took time . " He produced a cavernous belch that shook him to the fundament , and toppled backwards , ever so slowly , onto the couch , which recoiled to the floor and recovered . Massively he slept . Lori , too , slept in the chair , but the absence of sound as Reinhartrose and prepared to creep away , awakened her . " No , are you leaving ? " Reinhart pointed to the sofa . " He is spent , poor man ! " At the purity of her look , Reinhart seized her bony shoulders and shook them violently as he might have washed his overcoat with air . When he had exhausted the brutality of his violated virtue and summarized Bach 's dissertation , she tossed back her head and laughed extravagantly . " Bach in the SS ! Pardon my rudeness . Perhaps one must be German to see the joke . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he tell such a story ? " asked Reinhart , aloud but to himself , as the chair again received his mass . " If he concocts this out of the thin air the man is surely mad . " " No , he is not insane . The minds of the insane run in straight lines , not always Euclidean , but always straight . The job there is to find the geometrical system by which to measure them.  |p159Here  , if you insist , we have something eccentric , twisted but normal . In fact , " she added , " normal is twisted . " " But why evil ? " he wailed . " When people lie they make themselvesbetter , not worse . " " No , you foolish boy ! " She thrust her face up at him . " No , they first make themselves something , whether good or bad , but something . A man can not live without a function . Can you understand that , you American ? " He had never in all his life heard the national adjective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment himself , but there was yet one more hateful . " You German ! " he ranted . " Can you understand this : I am ashamed to be of German descent ! It makes me sick to my stomach . I might lie to make myself worse , as you say , but not to claim I hurt defenseless people . You once asked about my relatives  --  I hope they were killed in the bombing ! And if they were n't , they are dead anyway in their souls . Do you know what you did when you murdered the Jews ? You committed suicide , all of you ! " Of course , no sooner was it out than he realized he echoed Bach to the letter , and was ashamed . " Do n't talk of things you can not understand . " She turned her back . He reclaimed from the table the pack of cigarettes he had given Bach and made for the door . Lori pursued him . In the dank passageway , in the pale light that reached there from the lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must make you understand about Bach . It is simply an overactive anterior pituitary . Not only does this outlaw of a gland produce great size , but it also eliminates the sexual urge ! " " I do n't care , I do n't care . " Saying which again and again , he nevertheless permitted her to pull him back inside . He knew now of his own impotence : his great moral address had been delivered , every word , in English . Lori drew him to the chair and notwithstanding their differ/ences in size , literally knocked him into it , all that was necessary being one good push in the midsection . " Now , " she cried , standing militantly before him . " It was you who insisted on coming here . You forced me to bring you against my will . Therefore you will stay until I finish . Bach has done as much for me as one human being can do for another . He has saved my life , my very life ! , every single day for three years . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe , but she paid him no mind . " And it involved more than simply not turning me in to the Gestapo  --  you perhaps think in your naive way that that much could be expected of a husband ; you have not lived in Germany  --  and more than concealing me , too , although that at the daily risk of his own life . " Beneath the vast , important feelings Reinhart had a little tickle of pride , no less important , at her ceasing to speak so as to favor his imperfect knowledge of the tongue . She spoke swiftly and with the full resources of idiom and construction , and he did not miss a word . " The long story of his art collection is pitifully short . He sold it , piece by piece , to pay for day by day of my life . " " The Gestapo then could be bribed . " The idea made that dread agency less terrible . " The money went elsewhere . Who got it does not matter . " " Excuse me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't wish to answer you do n't have to . Why , when he has this to tell , does Bach pretend to be the reverse ? " " Because the meaningful things are never said . Because he is infected with the Berliner 's disease , irony and gallows-humor . Because  --  " She moved intensely near , and he was afraid she might call him American again , with all that scorn . " No , I shall not lie to you . . . . Because the time when he could do something for me has now passed . "  |p161He  found that , idiotically , he had replaced the wretched cigarettes on the table . " I came here tonight to take pity on you , " he said . " I have to ask it instead for myself . Believe me , it is not easy to be a fool . You have to work hard at it . " He went again to the door , this time unaccompanied , from which distance he looked long at her minor , crumpled figure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bach groaned lightly in his sleep while Lori with careful hands arranged a quilt on his recumbent hulk . Then , extinguishing all the lamps but the one on the central table , she came once more to Reinhart . " That saves me , nicht wahr ? That one-half Jewishness , that mongrel portion which so short a time ago condemned me , is now my salvation . And enlightened people no longer believe in miracles ! Yet within oneself , one is always just a person . Even Hitler . Do you know , his favorite meal was corn-on-the-cob and jelly omelet . Think of that : there were moments when his sole concern was to retain a bit of slippery jam on a fork . " He opened the door and stared forlornly into the gloomy passage . " Shall I light you out ? " " No thanks . I 'll try to manage that much on my own . May I come again ? " Briefly she was against him , her small head in the hollow of his rib cage . " You are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She gave his hand the short , one-shot European shake and said no more as he began the tortuous ascent to the mid-world.  |p162ONE  had his choice in the officers ' liquor ration , but one could not command what was not available . The fifth of gin representedan impressive trial of even Captain St. George 's noted patience , not to mention the vermouth . " Eleven months , Nate , it took me to assemble the ingredients of a martini , with the olives still to come . And the funny part is that I never eat the olives . Still , a drink looks naked without it , and I think , do n't you , that an olive adds a certain essential something . And the ice ! There 's something , where can a fellow get ice in this stricken city ? " No , pickled onions would never do , and although the fashion was passing to lemon peel , St. George had read , he held with the olive . " Besides , the question is academic : I have n't seen pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapeutic , a plump , well-padded bandage . Why the medics did not use him as resident healer in some recuperationcamp was beyond Schild 's reason . Sunset in the back yard with St. George , an awful thought as recent as two weeks ago , now was Schild 's hope . He had fallen into an attendance on the captain 's problems as one tormented by the rash might lower himself into a pool of warm oil and , comforted , in debt to the oil , so to speak , take up its study . A new approach for Schild , who hitherto might instead have gone into dermatology . But he had at once lost his strength , not by a slow erosion but at once , as if someone had opened a valve . Last night , undoing his tie before the mirror  --  an atypical incident ; Schild was so little concerned with his appearance that he rarely stood before the glass to put on his necktie , let alonep163remove it  --  standing , then , at the dresser , the room 's interior precisely reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight , like some small-flat resident with his persistent discovery in dreams of a door behind the bookshelf that opens into another room no one knew about . Admiring the new figure in the wallpaper , all the fresh textures , the dimensions not yet contemptibleby use , his eye swept to Lichenko and arrest . He had not , in the farthest reach of the new landscape , forgotten his guest ; indeed , deliberately he had sought him out , as if , since the mirrorworked a comprehensive reversal , it would also reverse Lichenko ; as if from a novel aspect he would be seen again as he had entered Schild 's affairs , the subsequent devious patterns now revealed as a foible of the stale vision . Instead , on Lichenko 's face reigned a supreme and splendid peace , a glutton 's on arising from the board , a sadist 's on hanging up his whip , a drunkard 's on counting his corks . He looked not at all at Schild but into the obesity of the featherbed that collapsedand reasserted itself under his experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed suit . He had got heavier in fourteen days , a fact that his reversed image stated with a kind of hostile assurance not apparent right side front . The German woman did up his clothes : his blouse a thing of smooth planes , his boots another mirror , the trouser crease a lethal edge . His eyes hung heavy , as if he could not bear the weight of the lids . Give him six months and he would be a little fat man , a fat little tradesman , retaining his cheek-furrows but in the discontent of prosperity . The fact was that an agent provocateur satisfied , however that surfeit sat upon his features , was an agent whose mission went well . To watch him was like looking into the mouth of a clogged toilet . The violence remained in the glass , as , turning away , he began to measure his position , he , Schild , the man of limited ambitions , commonplace talents , one who served , a rational man , mistaken now by who knew what compound of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for although he may have been guilty it was not of the transgression for which he was now under surveillance , could not be , for it was precisely his crime that he was incapable of a crime , and unfortunately no secret police or central committee was yet in search of that kind of deviation . As a boy he had developed a feat of controlled consciousness , a triumph over what was initially a disability , almost , he had feared at the time , a madness . Under duress of his parents , who were tyrants for the communal life  --  at least in theory , at least for the children ; when it came to themselves it was another thing : " when you grow up you got to work do n't forget it "  --  expelled from home , he had gone with a children 's group , Jewish , always and forever Jewish , to Coney Island for " fun " ; alwaysand again " fun , " a separate and distinct endeavor from one 's other pursuits , to be sought only by congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had not forgotten to leave behind their flesh and sweat glands . Despite the sun 's inability to plumb the floor of this forest of skin where he lay , he had , impossibly , got a bad burn . He did not tan and therefore unless forced avoided the sun ; once in it by necessity , however , he tested that familiar theory that stern resolution overcomes all , arriving at the invariable and , for one with dark hair and eyes , peculiarly shameful rebuttal of scorched hide . The end of this day found the flames mounting to his head ; he was lost for an hour and when found was sick enough to warrant being taken all the way to Manhattan in a taxi  --  for which when he was well he heard " somebody had to pay guess who ? "  --  and , home , was in a half-delirium for three days while his pelt grew leprous . Only half a delirium , because he knew what he was about and did n't , simultaneously ; or did but suspected he should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , so to speak , to be on the same terms with reality as other people . Lying on the sofa whose brown plush marked with patches of psoriasis the pointsp165of humanity too often stated  --  head , hips , and heels  --  watching his mother drop the wooden egg into the stocking toe , beneath the bridge lamp whose transverse member had long ago been separated from its upright by nervous readjustments and now bore its oiled-paper shade on the frayed cord alone , he felt a dread that she might not look up on schedule and carp . People do n't read on the flat of their backs holding the book over them like a sunshade , it blinds them at twenty . He yearned to receive the admonition that in normal times would have driven him out to the library and its public privacy ; now to assurehimself of actuality , it was a value from the past that he would have given even his assent to establish . His sister , in bed fifteen minutes , failed once to call for water ; for once his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out for cigars , which he rarely smoked . Across the airshaft from the kitchen , the Kaminskys were anaesthetized , for the first time in history they forbore to exchange insults in heavy Polish accents . In his three days of partial coma Schild learned what his twelve years of comparative clarity had not laid clear : in the degree of one 's need , one 's companions and surroundings becomenegative , fail to comply . One seizes the bathroom in a quiet hour and instantly sets a fashion for the others , who appear at the door in force ; one goes to the movies on Monday night and can not win a seat from the horde of people who will miss work next morning to perform this natural service of denial ; one is hungriest the evening the rest of the familly , ill , dine on rye and cream cheese and admire each other 's lack of appetite . These schemes are seen with the semiconsciousness as colors are more vivid and distances overcome with squinted eyes . In health , we are tormented by reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , Schild commanded this partial coma as it had in illness mastered him , for when the prisoner holds the key , a cell changes from a proscription to a defense of liberty . It later became his obsession that experience in the large could be conp166trolled  --  nay , must be , which had no regard for could  --  the alternative was fascism . But experience in the small , in the disparategrooves where the larger powers , so to speak , lacked elbowroom , what could not be ordered could at least be converted . In the present circumstance , Schild looked at Schild from a distance , finding him not small but different , as if in dramatic irony he knew something that his double did not . One Schild was doomed ; the other could stand here invisible and invulnerable , if necessary watch from asylum the first go to the noose . Schatzi had not appeared in ages . Schild had made two fruitlesstrips to Wannsee on consecutive nights ; on the third he had posted a note on a tree in the Fasanenstrasse , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking their families . This schedule , to be put into effect in ease of emergency , had been ready for use since his first engagement with Schatzi . The note read : " Seek whereabouts of Oskar Reichel , formerly of Ludwigkirchstrasse 32 . His wife is alive and well . Apply Bauer , Weddingweg 8 , Lichterfelde . " In theory , contact having been broken , Schatzi was thus directedto come to Schild , at the former 's discretion . In practice , he did not : clearly , because Schild had all at once acquired a bad odor . That Schatzi had himself fallen afoul of one power or another was unlikely , if not impossible ; further , it could not be imagined . If for no other reason , fate would keep him free to taunt Schild , whatever the extremity . Schild felt comfortably like a corpse , with Captain St. George droning on as sole mourner at the wake . The evening lurked in the population of leaves overhead , pandering for nightfall , which in Berlin appeared later than elsewhere and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could read your watch without a flashlight . St. George 's cigar-end periodically bloomed with fire , drooled a thin bouquet . His voice , deficient in resonance , permitted the transmission of noises from small live things rustling in the bush.  | " Even the lizards , or whatever that is , are going , as our British friends say , to Bedfordshire . That 's my idea , too . I am so yawn sleepy . Must be the yawn air . Gooyawnnight . " The captain rose and snapped-to his folding camp stool , tonightwith satisfaction . He liked smooth-snapping things , as being both easy and smart ; but his taste was often impeded by the stool , for which he frequently cursed Aberfitch &; Crombie : the extra ten dollars they added to every item had no justification when things stuck . Schild sorely wished him to stay , should have liked to make the brief sound which would have accomplished that , for it was no great or difficult feat to convince St. George his presence was wanted . Yet he could not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assuming Schild was asleep or , more likely , forgetting him simultaneously with his decision to retire , the captain stumbled into the rear door of the house . The night chill found Schild 's marrow . A bulky insect dropped into the hair of his forearm and was entangled to frenzy . Fool that it was , it interpreted his humane efforts as malicious and died shortly of its false assumption . He sat alone within the limitations of the fence ; a small yard , smaller still without St. George ; a corral with like squares on either side , extending on to the ends of the block : multiple petty-bourgeois cells . A creeper rose embraced the pickets . He once knew an Eagle Scout who was born and raised five stories above the sidewalk on 191st Street but could identify every plant within a ten-mile radius of the camp at Alpine , New Jersey . Their landlady slept on two biscuit mattresses on the floor of the kitchen . The easiest thing in the world , if she had not been German , would be to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been German , however , it would not be the easiest thing . He fancied his contempt had some sexual attraction for her . The angles of her face sharpened as he passed , and he sensed furtive movements behind doors when St. George was out of the house . But he had already had his gentile , and of the classic kind , corn/plete with rabbit nose , soap-and-water cheeks , and anti-Semitic Daddy and Mother , and he had no strong sadism even towards Germans . He turned his slat chair , property of the house , squealing rustfully in the joints , so that he could not see the kitchen window . A dog whined in the distance ; a Southerner or a Negro , passing on the sidewalk out front , described to a mute companion a succession of events that were invariably mothafuhn ; the faint odor of pine , which was everywhere at night in the western quarter of Berlin , was superseded by the sudden smell of candy , moreover , a precise candy : Mary Janes , nut-flavored , tallowlike caramel on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you one less for a penny than her competitors ; Milton , when she took ten minutes off for raspberry soda and plain cake , gave one more . Amazing so shrewd a woman never knew this for fifteen years . It was after Milton had been killed in Spain that she received this knowledge , along with the other things that had to be said , fat and old and bitter , knotting a cord end from the drawer of saved string . " Better they were poison ! " Although she should have known that her son was his master , and not vice versa . A boy , buying some candy , slipped a nickel underneath a newspaper on the counter , for it was Sabbath and Mrs. Grossman would not touch money until the sun had set . " Go read your books ! " she shouted to Schild in Yiddish , the language , it struck him suddenly , for many things but , above all , humor ; he could feel nothing beyond a terrible impulse to laugh and a sense of how terrible was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy , who had been delayed a moment , stripping the wrapperfrom his bit of sweet ; it was a Mary Jane . Schild 's teeth clogged in empathy , he could almost taste the peanut butter , it had always been very like putty . All this in the second before he knew , like a bat , that a human being stood in the darkness behind his chair . He sat easy , who else could it be but Schatzi ?  | " And here we have Herr Schild , zu Hause like any merchant . " Where had he been ? was an obvious question , but could not be asked . Schatzi made succulent sounds over his candy , offering some to Schild which when taken was a disappointment not livingup to its odor : so much for the memory . He was called back to the present ; the atmosphere was less charged at once . There sat Schatzi , renewing the link . He had been a fool to concoct an elaborate , sinister design from meaningless coincidence , for it was through Schatzi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple lieutenant in the Red Army be concerned ? One must face it that Lichenko was even rather pitiful . It was no disrespect , it took nothing from his honor , was no adverse implication on the triumph of the society that had given him his chance for manlinessand heroism , that Lichenko was  --  he almost thought , was no Milton Grossman ; but Lichenko , too , had charged the fascist guns . " I suppose you wonder where have I been , " said Schatzi , careful to keep it low . It was so dark now that he was seen as black on black , improbable but not impossible , which could not have been more appropriate to him . His voice , his rustlings , the thump of his butt-bones to the ground  --  all expressed an unusual geniality . In his own way , he apparently felt it good to see Schild again . He refused an offer of the chair , although it must have been uncomfortable for an ill man to sit on the cold earth . " I saw your note some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , really , I am just pleased , stay where you are sitting . The ground is not unpleasant . Beneath the grass you know is sand , it does not hold the water . Berlin is one single great island of sand on the Brandenburg plain , yet it permits a lush growth of plant life , no ? In spite of its architecture , Berlin is a beautiful city , but so few foreigners know it and that is sor-rowful . " Schild assumed the cynicism of his answer would be de rigueur : " There is little left to see now . "  | " So much the worse for all , " said Schatzi , not shouting but giving the illusion he was and with the kind of conviction that Schild recognized as having originated in higher chancelleries than either of them would ever subordinate . " It was senseless of the Americans to destroy the city . The most unfortunate way to win the German people away from fascism . " Lichenko had assured Schild that Russian artillery , particularly that multibarreled weapon known by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Berlin than the Eighth and Royal Air Forces together , and he had agreed then as he did now , yet neither time in hypocrisy . Schatzi , making liquid , furry , catlike noises , swabbed his gums with his tongue , and then went with the keen tip of his smallest finger for a molar in the recalcitrant love of caramel . Actually he could not be seen with such precision : his ring flashed in transit , his cuff rustled , and Schild supplied the other details from memory . " Not to speak of reconstruction , " continued Schatzi . " The Soviet Union has been given the most horrible section of the city . " To go any farther would be to imply that Stalin had been hoodwinked by Churchill and Roosevelt . Indeed , he had already gone too far . " You must indulge me in my English . Certainly I did not intend to say horrible ' except in regard to the bombing there . It is , on one 's other hand , the sector most worth for re-habilitation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ althoughSchild had often sought to turn to German , partly from a masochistic pride in his fluency  --  and partly from the vicarious nostalgia in which he looked back on the time before his majority : the tongue of the old International had been German . But Schatzi had resisted , not so much from a pride of his own , Schild thought , as from his sixth sense for conspiracy , which told him that obscurity had as great a role as precision in undergroundtechnique . In one 's second language , facts are never fi/nally established ; when blame must be cast , it can thus fall on the vocabulary and not the man , or if the man , then first on him who by birth qualifies for absolute comprehension . There is at any rate a possibility for such miscarriage , and the professional asks for no more , from his own side or the foe . Exploiting , to himself , his ambivalent pleasure with the presentconfirmation of the hypothesis , he received another notice  --  as he often did and as often was unarmed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the imagination of disaster , he had not the mind . His suspicions rose the faster for his inability to believe in them . Not only had Schatzi never beforetransmitted the " line " ; he had never been so generally obliging . His manner asked for forbearance , as if , getting that , he would go on to request ten dollars , repayable on demand . He was not , for once , in haste : he had never before sat at an interview ; he had never before come to Schild 's billet ; he had never before been pleasant . He continued to be , despite his theme , which was the occasion for neither grace nor evil but the neutrality of fact . And the first fact laid in Schild 's head by Schatzi multiplied within the minute ; in the same minute that his heart multiplied its reasons for foreboding , his reason produced offspring , like some woman in Asia , or what-have-you mise-en-scene for the current classic instanceof futile misery , who continues to reproduce like a mink notwithstanding the famine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " all the ex-Nazis are gettingjobs with the Military Government . " This cut off Schatzi for a moment of aggrieved silence . Now Schild had perhaps gone too far . His question was put in a voice that suggested this was the first time he had ever been brought to this turn of the road , one nearer the hairpin than was comfortable , and unless Schild could produce Automobile Associationsanction he would drag his feet . The sudden caution , standard operating procedure for anyonep172else to be met in Schild 's professional circles , was unusual for Schatzi , a piece with the rest of his tonight unique demeanor . But that this was the norm and Schatzi 's usual manner the oddity , had no force , for the ordinary Schatzi , who was extraordinary , was precisely what Schild had been prepared to meet in Europe . He had hated him , true , and he had just now begun to like him , but these nervous reactions were beside the point that Schatzi had been absolutely authentic . Or perhaps so directly to the point that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear and fascination of which Schatzi was a walking precis . Whatever his temporary odors , to Schild he stank of the concentration camp ; he had acquired there a beastliness which but for the final morality could not be separated from that of his captors . Hideous to think so ; but only moral realism to know that the difference between saint and devil was frequently never revealed until the last judgment . " By the way , " Schild said at last , when Schatzi 's moment of silence had lengthened into an evident volition not to speak at all , " I saw the big lout ' and have begun to go through the papers from his office . Only the top two or three cartons have Winterhilfefiles . The rest is material from the Bund Deutscher Madel . " " A female division of the Hitler Youth . " " Yes , I know that . " Schild was as usual irritated at being told what he already knew . " At any rate , I have filtered out some things for you . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the aspiration of a rubber pillow crushed by a thigh , and died . The crickets sang madly below the fence  --  or wherever ; if you went there to find them , they would instead be at the place you had left , and back there again only to hear their song in the bush . Behind Schild , a casement had its fastenings undone , its halves slithering open in slow provocation , followed swiftly by a broad drift of light that created a visible Schatzi but didp173not animate him . He wore bicycle cuff-guards resembling money clips . His shoes were swarthy , pebble-grained , and had long Italian points . The sole of one , showing a medallipn of chewing gum in the arch , hung directly before Schild ; danced to a rhythm that owed more to emaciation and senility than tacit music ; the leg within its frayed sheath of woolen underwear was surely bare tibia and fibula and a snarl of ancient sinews . Long underwearin the middle of summer : for his pants cuff had ridden high , one bicycle clip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the grass , with one leg arched high , the other looped over it . Had he suffered a seizure ? Schild rose to see beyond the bridge of legs , saw Schatzi 's eyes wide open , bland and insensitive as two bottle caps , paralytic . Dread had just put down his immediate , instinctive disbelief , he had just received the full import of the underwear shroud , when Schatzi belched like a cannon and with a sudden effort of overbearing vitality raised to the sitting position . " Queer person who lives in your quarters , " he said . Schild turned expecting that the German woman , deshabille , could be seen framed in the window  --  not in concupiscence of his own but in amused anticipation of Schatzi 's ; he was captivatedby the sudden transition from imagined death to carnality . Instead he saw Lichenko , in undress rightly enough , but Lichenko ! Who , bent at the waist , lips funneled and eyes squinted in bestial ill humor , swung one arm apelike . He was naked . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , Schild 's .45 . In the haste to the door Schild yet had attention for the nimble Schatzi , who had sprung up beside him and maintained the pace at his elbow . He saw in his courier 's action that which relieved his greater worry : would Schatzi , knowing of Lichenko , show the innocent curiosity of a boy chasing a ladder wagon ? They symbolically broke into the kitchen , for its door was open and only the oppressive light of the interior barred entry . The German woman lay stiff and still on her mattress in thep174corner , frozen in contempt , not fear , her handsome face fierce , free , and remote as an eagle 's . She had , it was clear , cowed Lichenko with no more than her moral advantage . Lichenko had jumped behind a high cabinet at the first sound of intrusion , where he thrust the pistol , or sought to thrust it , into the space between cabinet and wall . He was apprehended before this was managed . But , as if in that brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his project 's miscarriage , seen it , that is , as a mere limited venture gone awry with no permanent blot on the amour propre , he met Schild straight on , handing him the pistol butt-first  --  to show , by its empty slot , that it was not loaded  --  and offering his guileless face , open and unafraid . Was he drunk again ? Schild had taken care to keep whiskey from his own room and Lichenko without direction had set a personal off-limits on St. George 's quarters ; he had in fact developedan unusual delicacy towards the house in general , which Schild found more difficult to excuse than the expected barbarism . Yet here was the return of the barbaric , and he , Schild , had run to brook it , in his reflexes one with the scared calves at Lovett 's party . Schatzi , temporarily forgotten , spoke to the woman  --  had been speaking to her and was now heard reacting to her consistentsilence : " Keine Antwort is auch eine Antwort . " No answer is also an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Lichenko was not drunk . He began to shiver from the cold and adjusted the cinch in the towel about his waist , for neither was he wholly nude . He was , indeed , suddenly nothing he had been , neither victim nor captor nor naive nor sinister , and as he prepared to speak from this new person , Schild struck him in the mouth . He had meant to knock him unconscious , so that Schatzi could not hear the Russian accent , but he had never before struck a person with this intent ; he had never , since boyhood , struck any person for any reason , even comedy . He nowp175punched too high and tore his third knuckle on Lichenko 's teeth . It had been as hard a blow as he could summon in cold blood , but with only the free-swinging arm and no body behind it , did no physical damage . Lichenko , however , was whipped , all the more for his initial show of dignity . He grasped again at his towel , grinned in coy brutishness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whined , in German , and all was lost : " My friend , this whore tempted me ! " In his accent the first letter of Hure was a great and obvious G.From the other corner Schatzi burst into his aspirant snigger , and an oxlike plodding at the door announced St. George , who , in maroon robe with white piping , slippers with elastic inserts , and pajamas a continuum of pale-blue hounds-teeth , after some deliberation had formulated his amiable comment . " This looks like Grand Central Station ! " The pistol in his right fist , Schild furiously cut its barrel into Lichenko 's cheek and , as he went to the floor , followed him down , hacking him down , not ceasing his awful work until St. George , whose cries had gone unheeded , fell on him and stilled him with his bulk.  | " CA N'T find any letters of Grandpa 's you asked for  --  stuff all cleaned out from under the porch to provide place for screens years ago , " wrote Reinhart 's father . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . If my advice means anything , tho , I 'd drop the idea  --  your just asking for trouble  --  as soon as you find any German relations they will want to borrow money from you . . . , " etc. , typed on a V-mail blank , small as the Lord 's Prayer engraved on the head of a phi . Ask a stupid man , get a stupid answer . When he told Trudchenabout it  --  for , despite her peculiarities , she was still around , still without pay , reporting to the office every morning long before he arrived  --  she said : " Ah , vy bozzuh ! I will be your rela-tive . " That was all he had told her . He did not seek to expose her pitiful lies ; he let stand the assumption that she lived , orphaned , in the little back room in the office building , where indeed she did report at the end of each workday . Above all , he remained silent on the visit to Lori 's . What he had learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all certain he could stand to think of it himself . He at last understood that the complement to his long selfidentificationwith Germanness had been a resolve never to know the German actuality . Knowledge had exhausted his options ; he now had no choice but to seek out , if still they existed , his links to what , a brief half-century after Siegfried Reinhardt took ship for the New World , had disintegrated in murder and betrayal . He had not really believed the witness of the Buchenwald photographs ; mass exterminations were incredible . Real deaths.  |p177were  your friend Bill , one moment live , the next run down by a drunken driver ; Al killed by pneumonia ; Roy , his heart full of Jap metal , taking the Iwo Jima bastion and expiring a hero ; or someone 's brother , well known , electrocuted by the state for the crime of homicide , and his victim ; these corpses were believable in sight and mind ; despite the mortician 's garish art , beyond the mystery of any death , were the concrete memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gait , a red Ford with a two-tone horn , and the only four-button suit in southern Ohio . Similarly with the violet shadows under Lori 's eyes . Whoever had sold her safety from incineration had seen them upon every payment , must have had the queer guts to imagine their transformationinto white ash and his own agency in the burning . And the man who would have fired the oven , dressed in his black SS-suit , with his blond crown and his blue eyes , the model to which every boy aspires , the handsome soldier fearless before the enemy , gentle with women . . . . These types were not explainedby the simple , pious indignation of : two kinds of man , one good and one bad ; we of course are the first ; they , the second . Nor by the lack of a democratic tradition : was this what men did when denied the vote ? Nor militarism : you mean that the great Frederick mounted his stallion and rode down women and children and unarmed men , and that the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reinhart had been reared in what he assumed to be ( since everything else was ) the German code ; there are two kinds of cowards : one who will not fight a man his own size or larger , and one who will fight only someone weaker ; sometimes , but by no means always , the same person . But the validity of this , too , was here outmoded , for the SSman , fresh from his ravages on the helpless , stood fast against the superior enemy ; was , to be sure , the fiercest soldier met by the Allied troops . As to the anonymous blackmailer , Reinhart insisted that his , too , was a strange , mad kind of courage , for beyond gentlenessp178and humanitarianism and a deficiency of passion , what stays the normal man from murder or even its threat is fear , not of the godly or human law or vengeance or nightmares , but of the suggestion of his own mortality . Here all the known qualities of humanity had been united with their contradictions . This was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that guilt could be confessed to only in a lie of the guiltless , that the first loss of the criminals had been in their human imaginations . Where Reinhart had looked in Germany for life , first in dreams of ancient glory and then , after the Nazis , for a vitality at least of evil , he saw only a horror of deadness , of which the literal corpses , the loose skins of Dachau , were but the minor part . Yet more important than this moribund nation were the good people , those " good Germans " on whom the sanctimonious propagandaof Our Side did its work of slaughter , the mature ones like Bach who by conscious volition stayed decent and sought no fanfare for it now , and children like Trudchen who willy-nilly were clean . Were his relatives to be counted with them ? Even in his duty of conscience , however , he was balked by the same ineptness which characterized his dealings in the humdrum ; when fountain pens were hard to get , people like Marsala had pocketsful ; similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reinhart , so damned special , one of the ought-ought per cent of the American population to go to college , a member of the owning and stable class , could manage nothing . It was very well to say loosely , as Lori had , to go to the burgomaster'soffice . He tried just that , visited the town hall in Schoneberg , which he was astonished to see employed as many bureaucratic flunkies as it were an American city untouched by war , who notwithstanding that he was Occupation showed much the same bored insolence and then when pressed claimed a search of the birth records back to 1850 turned up no Siegfried Reinhart . Of course , there was always the Russian Sector , whichp179the eyeglassed clerk recommended snottily-reproachful , as if to say : that 's what you get for dividing our city . There was what Reinhart would earlier have identified as certainly a Nazi ; now he thought it more likely the man might turn out to be an unsung hero of the anti-Hitler opposition and this job his reward . He got aid from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Trudchen his project left her cold , she greeted him one morning with sudden interest and suggestion . " You must have a dett-ek-tive ! And I have just your person . The man who makes some work about here  --  he with the scarred face . He is called  --  so silly !  --  Schatzi , that means sweetheart , ' did you know ? Do you know which I intend ? " She had her own table now , a jittery-jointed piece which swayed like a drunken spider when she assaulted the old Underwood . " He is very active in the black market . This takes him everywhere and in consequence to that he knows everyone . " " Not the old man in the Wehrmacht cap ? " A regrettable concomitant of Trudchen 's employment was false tint laid on thickly over her natural color , and Reinhart also bore the guilt of that . He had bought her lipstick and rouge from the PX , on her request for the " raddest of the rad . " " Oh , he has worn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sells one thing , he attires himself in another . " " You do n't mean that old man who works in Lovett 's office ? " " Not regularly . He makes much money on the black market  --  why should he vorry ? " And he had thought the old fellow pitiful ; it was a true instanceof what one , disinclined to contribute , says of street cripples with their tin cups : they could probably buy and sell any of us poor working stiffs . " I do n't suppose he was a National Socialist ? " Reinhart could no longer use " Nazi " ; with the passing of each German day the term became more like the name of a soap powder , some slick and vulgar " Rinso " invented by Americans , who eventually re/duce everything to that level : " Nazi , " the cute name for a pack of buffoons , played always by the same actors , regularly thwarted by some clean-shaven Beverly Hills Boy Scout whom a ruptured eardrum disqualified from the real war . However , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , since in this area Trudchen 's unreliability was massive . Perhaps understandably , to her the history of modern times was a catalogue of her own losses and the responsible instrument , fate in general . She lifted her little painted clown's-face , the freshness obscured by the rouge but the innocence still there , and said : " Not he ! He was a prisoner in a concentration camp . " Which was a flat lie  --  although perhaps not hers but the old man 's ; the surviving martyrs of the camps were hardly thrown into menial jobs and black-marketeering . " Ausgezeichnet ! Prima ! Then he should be just the man to find die Familie Reinhart , " he said in an irony that she did not receive . " Of course it is n't likely he 'll find anybody . There 's a separation of fifty years . Think of that , Trudchen , the last time I was German my father had n't yet been born . " " Please ? " Instead of clarifying it , he fell to work with his pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't soon return his pen he must come right out and ask her to  --  on the long-delayed Guide to the Ruins for the sightseeing tour . The Olympic Stadium , built for the Olympic Games in 1936 , has a seating capacityOr was it more graceful to say " seats " ? Or " seats " as a noun : " stadium , etc. , has 124,000 seats . " " Capacity " of course had a more serious tone . This was one of those days when nothing sounded right , which unluckily had begun to outnumber those on which nothing sounded wrong.  | " You do not wish to hire this man ? " asked Trudchen , starting to type the stencil for Page One , which , for Pound had decided on a grandiose project that would impress the colonel , was to stand as title sheet . He had to grin . All European girls spoke with an animation at once funny and delightful , an excess of feminine vitality that juiced each word . If this held even in a sadness like Lori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay , who was young and unmarredand in a perpetual celebration of ripeness , it was the very model of unalloyed girlship ; you never , as sometimes at Home , suspected that you confronted a transvestite boy . " Ah , " she went on , " how hoppy you will make zem ! In these timess to have an American cowsin ! " In mock grimness he answered : " Our American Cowsin . I hope for better luck . That 's the name of the play Lincoln was watching when he was shot . " " By Chon Vil-kes Boat , yes ? " This in an eagerness which threw a tremble into her physical establishment . " And the year , 1864 , yes ? The day I do not know . " " Do n't ask me ! " He ambled to the French window to look on as perfect weather as the earth offered , the life-enhancing air of the Brandenburg plain , full of golden light and green smells . " My family was n't in the country at the time . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , or had they waited for rain ? The great pines stood high in the adjacent grove , and seeing down among their feet he recognized the steel-gray , crosshatched shadows from old German engravings , which were not artist 's strategy but the true lay of the land . He could have watched without doubt a delegation of trolls emerge from some roothomeand bear away the Nibelungs ' lode , but impossible to the mind 's eye were the long sallow lines of victims . " This man , this good German , how can I get in touch ? " Trudchen giggled like a spring : " Tahch  --  this is very vivid andp182so clear that no explanation is needed  --  baht he vill come here some time . I have taken the freedom to ask him that you might ... vould . . . could  --  oh well , that you want to see him . " Along with the cosmetics she wore a peek-a-boo white blouse disclosing an eyelet-margin slip and , beyond , the rim of a brassiere which carried larger burdens than formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer swung free but were entwined about her head in a yellow cocoon . In the aggregate , this was also a lie : that she was a mature girl . " If he was in a camp , then he must be a Jew ? " Asking which he returned to his desk and fell into the chair with the noise of a beef haunch flung onto a butcher 's block . " Oh no ! " cried Trudchen with candid enthusiasm . " You are incorrect when you think only Jews were mistreated . You do not know of the Resistance ? " Sure , the plot to kill Hitler of 20 July 1944 . This had already been exposed in his discussion groups as a conspiracy of reactionarygenerals , scarcely better than der Fiihrer himself , whose motives were suspect and results , a failure ; and who were eleven years late . Of course there was that  --  she took no notice of the negating conditions , perhaps because he lost his nerve while talking to her , who was blameless , and presented them weakly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and duration , embracingall of the non-Nazi population : a total rejection of Hitler and all of his works , dating back to 1933 and earlier . She as a German could tell him that , even though she took no interestin politics , being young and silly . " And what did they do about it ? " " Ah , what can anybody do against beasts who are ruthless ? The SS and the Gestapo , their first job was to control Germans , not Jews . " He sat upright and brought down his fist upon the desk , not in anger but rather a kind of pleading.  | " That is understood . But it is over now . National Socialism turned out to be nothing . You could n't find one German today who would say a good word about it . Yet it was a German thing , was n't it ? I do n't mean the war , or the Axis , but what went on here : a horrible , dreadful thing that was completely new . Old Genghis Than and Attila the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man is disgusting , I grant you , but why would the Germans try to set a new record ? But no , I do n't even want to ask that . God knows if I had been a German what Iwould have been . But why ca n't someone at least say he is sorry ? " He looked into space , for he had no wish or reason to make it personal . He was an idiot to speak of this to Trudchen , and she was quite right to look calfly insensate and say : " One can not be sorry for what one has not done . " " You must pay me no attention , " she went on , " because I am not clever , but what I can see is that God makes people suffer . " Her mouth and eyes went into round wonder , which made her , there behind the crazy lines of lopsided table and old typing machine , a complex of circles : head , eyes , glasses , mouth , breasts , hips . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , I had the fortune to be in the Bayerischer Platz Underground stationwhen your planes came over making a direct strike with an aerial mine that blew a thirty-feet hole out of the bottom of the tube . So suddenly I did not feel anysing , no wownd , and knew only what occurred when this baby in the arms of the vo-man in front of me , now , with the blast , on top of me , this baby stared down and tried to cry at me but instead of the cry this string of blood dripped quietly from its mouth . It was alive , but dead , also ; both at the same time  --  how can I explain this terrible sing that I mean ! Your planes had come to kill Nazis , but the bombs can not tell good from bad . A little chilt of eight months old , it had to suffer . Is it not the same way with God 's vengeance for the murder of Jesus Christ ? "  |p184It  was wackily , harmlessly funny , as when the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get for all that drinking . But she was growing into a big girl , and it was time to be set straight  --  which no one had bothered to do for him when he was on that level . " You do n't  --  " he began , when Lieutenant Pound appeared in the doorway and Trudchen hurriedly flung back into her story . " So when this blood began to descend upon me I reached towards my sleeve for the handkerchief but my hand could not go far , being halted by a soft , varm , cling-ging mass such as one 's hair after washing it , and I thought : so I have lost an arm , how easier in the fact than in the worry . Limbs , limbs , I have always feared losing them most . " " Do n't bullshit , Trudchen , " said Pound , patiently genial , closingthe door which was in his absence never closed , demonstratinghis talent for violently hurling it to without its latching : he " pulled " it , as one does a punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigfat white arms today . " Although his monastery was now neat , this abbot had stayed slovenly ; as he went briskly to his desk below the little window , his loose shoelaces clicked , his tie end flapped over his shoulder , his bowlegs like two lips endlessly yawned away from each other and gulped shut . Perhaps it was Pound 's own experience in violence : he never believed anything she said . And by his example , Reinhart , too , invariably lost belief . Although , given her time and place , the tale had been credible enough at the outset , with the introduction of self it became fiction like all the others . She was , he had to face it , the most incredible liar he had ever met . With a significant look at Pound , who was too bored to registerit , Reinhart said : " Go on , Trudchen . What happened then ? " " Well , it was really an arm , but blown off from someone other and lodged between mine and my ripps , as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stencil in the position described ;  |p185buff  backing to the outside , it was a painfully authentic replica . Her attention was now directed exclusively towards Pound , and Reinhart , in half-conscious jealousy , went to block her line of vision . " You know what ? You are a prevaricator ! " Silently , Trudchen unrolled the third arm in the enormous self-confidence the mythomaniac shares with the artist , while at the same time her round nose sharpened as if in death , as if for a moment she really tested that condition the truthful call life , and rounded again as quickly ; she had been there before and did not like it . " Stop pissing around with the kid , " Pound ordered irritably . He was in a rare short mood , probably connected with the miscarriageof certain affairs of money , towards which these days he had developed an obsession . The black market had denuded him of watch , pen , pocket knife , cigarette case , lighter , ring , identification bracelet , all bedding but one blanket , all ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caps beyond one each , towels , writing paper , the leather frame of his wife 's picture , and his musette bag . Three days earlier he had received by mail a new pipe and pouch : the latter had already metamorphosed into a paper envelope . Which he rustled in now , spilling much , but onto a page of Yank , which when done he coned to funnel back the overflow , his narrow eyebrows shimmering ever upwardslike heat waves fleeing a summer pavement . " Have n't you finished that guidebook yet ? " he went on , with querulous twitchings . " The colonel has a wild hair in his asshole ever since Lovett 's Folly . He might put us on cleaning butt cans any minute . " Because he was properly a cigarette man , he smoked a pipe the wrong way , inhaling great mortifying draughts which after a time in his innards came back through every superior aperture , mouth , nose , ears , eyes , suggesting that his head was afire . " I 'll finish it today , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industry ; she socked so loudly at the typewriter you could n't hear the clearing of your own throat . No sooner did a third person come than he felt odd man out ; his maximum for rapport was one being at a time . Thus it was fine with Pound alone , or alone with Trudchen , but with three people he invariably sensed a conspiracy against him . " Oh good , " said Pound . " If you are that close to the end , you can put the fucker aside for fifteen minutes and write me a letter to the wife . You know , this and that , etc. , and I 'm short on dough because we had to buy new winter uniforms this month . " " You short on dough ? " Pound made a sighing descent into his swivel chair . " Come over here , " he said confidentially . " I do n't know why I ca n't tell you , since you know all my other chicken-shit business . The thought of going back to that woman  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can stomach . You know , when I was wounded I made kind of an agreement with Fate that if I did n't die I would be somebody new . I never told this before to anybody in the service , but I used to be , before I was drafted , a bank teller for thirty-seven fifty a week , a creepy little rectumkissingrabbit with two snot-nosed kids and a dog with some kinda skin rash that made his hair fall out in pink spots  --  he also used to sit around on the rug in the evening and fart all the time  --  and this woman , see . Well , she is n't the worst person in the world , but she is set on making a man a coward . She even wanted to scare me out of using a blowtorch to take off the old paint on the outside of the house  --  which I was only doing cause who can afford those prick union painters and if you hire scabs the others will come by and bomb your house  --  you 'll start a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did it anyway , and you guessed it , it did start a fire that burned off one wall . I never missed Bob Hope 's radio show on Thursday nights for five years  --  Professor Colonna : that 's what I keep telling them down at the office ' ; Brenda and Cobina , and the rest ofp187them . Think of that : 259 straight ; once they were off because of a special news feature , something about that fucking shitbum Hitler . I tell you I was yellow as they come , but after basic they sent me to OCS where they thought that was just being cautious , I guess , a good quality for a officer . Well , we were pinned down along this hedge row in Normandy and I was dumping in my pants for fear , but still I noticed my top fly button was loose and I fastened it . And then I thought what a dirty little turd I was : with your ass about to be blown off and you button the barn door  --  do you get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than of the German 88s . So I thought all of a sudden : World , you got twenty-eight years from me , you can keep all the rest and stick them up your giggy , and I jumped up and went across there and took that Kraut platoon , and I do n't mean to say I was n't scared , but anyway for once there was a reason . Shit . " He had puffed so hard on his pipe that already its tobacco was exhausted and the air made noxious . " You know what I made so far on the black market ? Thirteen thousand , two hundred and twenty-two dollars , and it 's all gone back to the States to a bank in L.A. , California . That 's where my nurse Anne Lightner is from , L.A. , where they go in for the beach living . I 'm going to get sprung from this woman as soon as I get home , and then I 'm going out there and buy a used-car lot . That 's the kind of thing they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody drives a car , that 's what Anne says . " So was another idea exploded . It was sad , in a way , that nobody , simply nobody was what he seemed . To Reinhart , Pound had been the classic type of swashbuckler . Now he saw the late bank-clerk lines of worry and doubt , faded but still visible , at the corners of mouth and eyes , and he even liked him better for them  --  for daring has no unusual moral worth if you have lived with it from the cradle  --  yet there was no discounting the loss of something rare . " But I have to play it cool with Alice till I get back and canp188defend myself , " said Pound , refilling his pipe . " So write her nice . I do n't have to tell you what to say , you have enough crap to snow anybody . " This was admiringly put , with the quick wink he must have learned in his new life , but looking sharply Reinhartsaw the hint of a quaver in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor part , there was still a tinge of bluff . All the while Trudchen had been typing with fanatic energy  --  faking madly , for the guidebook manuscript lay on Reinhart 's desk . As he passed her on the return route , a doorknock sounded , and notwithstanding his shouted " Enter ! " she leaped up and teetered to the knob  --  high heels , yet ! It was a soldier , for Pound . She made him wait while she proceeded to the lieutenant with a formal announcement , working her body in a queer movement which Reinhart first believed was an effort to balance on the high spikes and then recognized as an amateur version of a whore 's undulations . Her breasts were hard metallic cones , yet she still wore the thin , little-girl 's skirt ending an inch above the knees , and still the owlish , juvenile spectacles . Involuntarily he burst into a loud , barking laugh , which hideous though it was nobody but himself seemed to hear . Lieutenant Schild 's judgment had been correct , only a bit premature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expected to be one jump ahead of events ) ; if she was not on her way to tartdom , then Reinhart was an orangutan . " Dearest Alice , " he scrawled on the yellow pad , taking in return a warm thrill of fancy that this unseen proxy wife was really his own , that he had entered her in the connubial bed and that she had borne him two small resemblances of himself , albeit snot-nosed . On Pound 's indifferent grunt Trudchen wobbled back to her table . Reinhart had also purchased the mascara which gave her an appearance of sore , fire-tinged eyes , but the high heels were from another protector , he now had no doubt.  |p189The  soldier had gone . In his stead , in the hall shadows beyond the half-open doorway stood a shrouded representation of a human figure , crepuscular , mysterious . Upon Reinhart 's look it slid noiselessly out of range . Sauntering , Pound took Trudchen 's typewriter from beneath her very pounding fingers , ripped out and discarded the paper , and saying " At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " left . " Darling Alice : Sweetheart , I  --  " Reinhart began again . " You try alvays to hoomiliate me . . . " Trudchen 's lips were fashioned into a little red crossbow , through which slid the pink bolt of her tongue , in and out , tasting the lipstick . He threw down the pencil in disgust , said malevolently : " How about returning my pen ? " " Vy do you always do this ? Because I am only this little Germangirl ? " He strode massively across and bruised his fist on her table : " Right now , I want that pen ! " " Oh , Gee whiz ! " Find who taught her that and you had the whoremaster : Reinharthad never said " Gee whiz " in all his life long . But the tears were her own . He had last seen them when she cursed that poor Jew for telling the truth . " Well , Gee , take it beck again , and do n't say I vas shtealing it . " Engulfed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smeared rouge , falling hairpins  --  for in the grief she tore her hair down into the old pigtails  --  she opened the middle drawer and drew away . Reinhart came round behind her . There it lay , the old black Parker , that gallant , veteran instrument of romance and adventureon two continents , vicarious cannon , sceptre , phallus . He seized it , already feeling the brute , and when her blue eyes peeped sideways at him over their scorched rims and she said " I oppologize "  --  by this time he had long forgotten what the beefp190was and took the pen merely so as to return it to her formally , as a permanent gift . " So kind , " she cried , smiling-through-tears . " Do you care for my shoes ? I have yesterday traded them with the chocolate you gave me . " " Fabelha f t ! " He stood behind her , hands lightly riding her narrow shoulders , eyes descending into the sweet crevasse of the pectoral range , very clear through the thin cloud of blouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " so you will not think so bad of this little Germany . " From the drawer she withdrew a handbill of cheap European paper , weightless , the color and grain of whole-wheat bread , infamouslyinked . All he could read from where he stood was aheadline : ES LEST : MENSCHLICHKEIT ! " Proclamation of the Resistance , " she crooned victoriously . " I have found it in this very room , in the carton-boxes . Perhaps this selfsame room in which we sit was nothing but head-qvarters ! " Long Live Humanity ! , no doubt to be understood in the sense of Hitler 's Peace , a peculiar German cruelty . He received her greatest whopper with an enervation so profound as to be almost pity . " Trudchen , I can read German . . . " he groaned , his hands rising heavily from her shoulders and more heavily returning . " Then read ! " she screamed , turning in frenzy , and his left hand traveled into her blouse at the open neck and down the breasts ' warm canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fear , awe , and finally , madness , rose to his neck like the sucker of a great vampire fish surfacing from the depths of the sea , fastening to the elbow of his windpipe , so that , prohibited from breathing he fisted a tail of blonde hair and pulled as if to sever her head from the shoulders . In a moment his large right arm proved stronger than small-girl lips ; he had her loose and held her gaping , an interval for bullyingp191mastery , and then turned her , brought her forward and up , the nether hand taking a purchase within her fat furrow , hot beneathcool cloth , and carried her to cover the light snow of tobacco grains on Pound 's clean desk . ' ' He had come so far in what had seemed desperate comedy , as in school when the kids steal your cap and you tolerate their passing it just out of reach until the smallest boy is the bearer and you engulf and batter him to the point at which his incipient grief takes the laugh off you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed , herself , as one does whose will is consonant with the world 's ; the little witch 's face in a garish disorder of evil , yet her odor was childlike , of soap . In endless pursuit of pride , then , he became fastidious , working his way through the jungle of queer fasteners and ribbons , and the three buttons which at the crucial junction of her parts secured the last guardian triangle of doveskin fabric , beaching finally upon a little round belly incapable of further discovery . The key in the devil 's lock , entrez monsieur , enchante de faire votre connaissance , excruciating , pain , pain , pleasure  --  well into that groove of unification where the senses are harnessed towards a single fanatical end , his suddenly lost purpose . Ah , it was all so crazy . A small window broke the wall above Pound 's desk , high above  --  standing at full height Reinhart could just frame his face in it  --  and absurd , fit only for some lazy postman on stilts to pass a parcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labyrinth . It was from this glass that he got an immaterial signal into the corner of the eye , and as if to breathe and moisten the throat , he straightened and turned his head , saw close up to the pane the feathered neck of a man who wanted a barber , Pound 's ; beyond and lower , a face like a contour map of an asteroid , ripped and pitted by hot chips flying off Jupiter ; two had by accident embeddedcollaterally and , still smoking , were eyes : ostensibly directed at Pound , but seeing him , knowing him and what he was at , not caring , not even amused , but knowing . The old Ger/man , now named : Sweetheart . In exchange for the typewriter he presented a thick wad of notes . Pound buttoned them in an upper pocket and , one-breasted like an Amazon , vanished . " Mein Tiger ! " whispered Trudchen . Looking down , melting , Reinhart felt rather than saw he had unwittingly been a success . He had also forgotten all precautions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran the series of awful upshots . " Ach , " said Trudchen , yet hypersensitive , opposing partition , " I have taken care . . . " Not knowing to what she referred , he accepted her assurance . Crumpled in her fist , the old handbill , taken in surprise like everything else , was still their partner . He tore it from her and read the first line below the bold title , read it twice as with his unoccupied hand he returned himself to order . It did not change : " The appeal of Hitlerism is to the eternal Schweinhund in man . " Of course it was anti-Nazi ; no matter by whom or where , it had been produced in honor and conscience and at cost , and its anonymous author , if he had eluded his compatriot enemies , had lived perhaps only to drown in the same foreign flood that swamped them . He kissed her , long and exploratory , for the first time , and saying " Ah , I must be crazy , anyone could have walked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden isolation . He ran through the French window and around the corner , and saw that Schatzi had not , because of his heavy burden , got farther than the public sidewalk . Schatzi accepted the inevitable cigarette and slipped it between his ear and the drooping rim of the workman 's cap that with neckerchief and soiled jacket and weary trousers formed his present costume , which he would surely have had trouble in selling to a naked man . " Do you need some conversation ? " he asked , with a tremble of his nose , " or is it simply generosity ? Excuse my lack of strength . "  |p193He  placed the typewriter upon the octagonal stones of the sidewalk . No sooner was it done than a woman rode by on the adjacent bicycle path and they felt the slipstream of her passing . " Into the mechanism no doubt this blew some sand , " said Schatzi , his voice like a dumping of gravel . " So much longer to clean ! " He elevated his hands in a Jewish shrug , and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran it across his upper lip , making a gargoyle mouth . Seeing him now in reality and close-up , Reinhart could not doubt his girl friends ' tales were true : if Schatzi were not from the concentration camp , then that establishment was illusion . True , he was more than mere skin , but give an unfilled pelt a few months ' meals and you would have Schatzi . He lived , but just lived and no more , with not one breath beyond the essential . His face was dreadful , romantically hideous , in the ugliness only supreme virtue permits , perhaps creates , as with the old saints ; and though his angles were sharp , his constant tremble blurred and made them remote . Confronted with this overwhelming authenticity , Reinhart on the instant forgot his purpose and , instead of speaking , sent a grin . He watched Schatzi catch it , warp it with the secret they shared , and send it back . " Your breathing is labored , " he said . " Exercise shortens the span of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without movement , like a piece of warm bacon , all his life long , la ? " " I never thought of that , " answered Reinhart . It seemed so marvelously reasonable ; he put from his mind the obvious reference to the tumble with Trudchen and worried about the years gone in nailing down his coffin with a barbell . He had never beforetalked with an authority on mortality  --  who yet , he saw with a happy loss of trepidation , was also a human being , whose smile was only superficially diabolic . For a great sweetness was exuded by Schatzi 's hard person as he suddenly stared into Reinhart 's face and said : " You wish top194send me on a qvest , ja ? She told me , this little piece of sausage , this Gretchen  --  " " Trudchen . " " So . You search for your kinfolk  --  this is correct , kinfolk ' or simply kin ' ? " So close was he , perhaps by reason of defective hearing , he almost climbed Reinhart 's frame . It was disconcerting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must stink and drew always away , until on the fifth circle of their patch of walk he envisioned how from a distance their two figures must look in revolution and permitted himself to be captured . He had been quite wrong : Schatzi put forth the distinct odor of eau-decologne . " Wwwwell , " said Schatzi , " you have come to the right potty . " Ve vill "  --  successful pronunciation of the first w satisfied him in perpetuity  --  " simply look for all the Reinharts who are not yet dead and there you are ! " He actually winked , which is to say one eye was swallowed whole by the lids , like a ravenous bird ingesting a black cherry . Impossible to think the concentration camps had not been serious ; therefore what Reinhart saw before him now was the human triumph , a wit which had faced the dreadful and survived , no cloistered humor like his own . He himself was suffering depression , feeling wet and dirty and unusually exposed , and indeed , since Schatzi had taken the initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want to remind you of your troubles , " he said , though of course he did , " but would you say the concentration camp was the worst thing that could be imagined ? " If Schatzi had earlier been ebullient , he now went into a positivedelight that Reinhart , because he had no experience of the world , found very grisly . " Ah , no , no , not the worst ! The worst , my young friend , is top195die . Just that simple . Two added to two makes four , always . The living and the dying , and nothing else , makes ray-oll-ity . " So Reinhart , conscious it was asinine but getting no other suggestions , gave him another cigarette . Which went behind the other ear . " Now you must tell me an answer , " Schatzi said . " Why must you find these relatives ? Of course , " he went on before Reinhart could speak , " to help them . You Amis are a decent lot . You do not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , /a ? This gives one faith for the future of the world in your hands . " Hard as Reinhart looked among the rocks which clicked together in Schatzi 's voice , he could find no insincerity , therefore he stifled the impulse to say " Horseshit ! " He had at last , there could be no mistake this time , found the man with a right to say anything and it be valid . Not even Bach and not even Lori , not even when he had learned their truth , had so impressed him . " I 'd think you would hate the Germans . " " I hate them ? My friend , I am myself a German . " Saying which Schatzi bent to the typewriter , on the way down adjusting his cap , the crown of which was dark with oil . Someone had borrowedhis tie to hang a felon and returned it with a frozen knot that would never undo ; no doubt he had it wired to his collar or to that frail armature on which his pennyworth of skin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weight . Reinhart moved to aid him but was waved off . " But one detail  --  " " Of course . " In this regard Reinhart never admitted another as master . He produced his wallet and counted off five hundredmarknotes , fifty dollars , from the wad of five thousand which Marsala had got from a Russian soldier for Reinhart 's graduation watch . " I did n't mean you to do this for nothing . " " Now , " said Schatzi , " you have shamed me with your gener/osity . Ray-oily , I can not  --  " He drew from his pocket a brilliant blue handkerchief and snorted into it , thin and airy like a fife badly played . He took the money . " This is not what I purposed to say  --  which at any pace , I have now forgotten . " Reinhart watched him go down the walk with his burden . Twenty feet away , he turned and shouted , " You shall hear of me ! " And then he moved off the pavement into the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give him his grandfather 's name ! Hot on the trail he ran , through the patch of forest to the wide prospect of Argentinische Allee , and surveyed the feasible directions . But Schatzi was gone.  |p197SCHILD  's father 's business was concerned with buttons  --  well , you know how capitalism works on the petty levels , he neither made them nor used them , but stood in the middle between maker and user , collecting a profit . Lichenko , however , did not know these things , which was why he asked . He was especially interested in the money : were the earnings large from such a trade ? " He never thought so , " said Schild . " But they were considerablybetter than working-class wages . " His smile was both bitter and genial  --  the first towards the distasteful topic ; the second for Lichenko , to whose will he was now committed . " Oh , but the workers , we will not speak of them , " Lichenko said contemptuously . " You surely are of a superior class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , in one way or another , for three days , and Schild could not yet gauge the degree of its subtlety . Lichenko closed his eyes now and breathed profoundly , as if he were falling off . Sometimes he did ; sometimes , after the same indications , not . The game hinged on whether or not Schild rose to go : if he did , Lichenko awakened ; if he did not , Lichenko slept . The bed was a chaos of stale sheets decorated with brown blood and streaks of St. George 's iodine salve . Lichenko had not left it since they laid him there on the night of the beating . Not that he had been seriously hurt : his actual wounds  --  a slash of the cheek , an abrasion of the lower lip  --  had , after the excitement was done , proved superficial . The rest were bruises , ugly , indigo-and-lavender , but bruises , and had already begun to pale under the application of St. George 's paste . And he had beenp198struck only in the face , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no special need for this perpetual pillowing . Yet there he lay , sometimes straight and stiff as a corpse , suppressingbreath ; sometimes curled like a foetus , in which position he made bubbly noises ; sometimes with limbs wanton and torn mouth wearing a wan , roguish smile , as if he had dropped there exhausted from a saturnalia . Schild felt towards him a strange , new emotion : not , as in the case of Schatzi , loathing compounded of fear and envy , and certainly not the fierce hatred which was the sudden motive for the beating  --  indeed , the latter had been transformed in his memory to a distant episode involving two strangers who bore no resemblance to the Lichenko and the self he knew . Rather , this strange new feeling was the sad , sour regret of a father towards an offspring he can neither endure nor discard . He would have liked , in a moment when his own back was turned , to have had him obliterated in some bloodless , painless fashion , with no noise . His blows had pierced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hitherto obscured with romantic moralizing . Lichenko had originally stayed on at the billet to grovel in comfort like a pig in a slough , although admittedly deserved . But the fact of his second breach of peace indicated not all of him had yet gone soft . The fine , progressive elements in his conscience had rebelled against the ease , not with sufficient force to carry him back to duty , but at least enough to generate a protest , which appropriatelyhad been directed towards the German woman . At that point a deft understanding might have restored him to manhood . Instead , Schild had pushed him back again , perhaps forever beyond redemption . But in destroying him , he had also cemented Lichenko to himself . If his earlier hosthood , which he recognized as having been too permissive , owed to simple courtesy , it had since the beating become a nurseship , bonded by the obligations of guiltp199and limited by nothing . He found it ethically impossible even to object when Lichenko , who certainly could walk as well as ever , preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transported by Schild  --  he would not suffer the Hausfrau in the room . Although at other times he showed great facility in bedpositions  --  theass mountain , the pretzel , the scissors , the beached fish , the dismembered Osiris , the solipsist ostrich  --  at mealtime Lichenko would not elevate from absolute supine , so that there was nothing to do but spoon-feed him like an infant . His back itched fiercely every quarter-hour and would admit no cure but the application of Schild 's hairbrush , wielded by Schild , to the trough of his spine . The problem of washing , which offended Schild most , even more than the bedpan , had been rather more simply resolved : Lichenko left it behind when he took to invalidism . A person , he believed , did not get dirty in bed . With the passing of the days , his decision seemed less fortunate . After three , in a room from which Lichenko also had decided to bar fresh air on the ground that in his weakened condition he might contract a disease of the lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two more days have come to yearn , the call for soap and water . Naturally , a man in sickbed needed recreation . Lichenko requiredan oral reading of each day 's Stars and Stripes , first in the original  --  so that he could " study English "  --  and then in German translation . The comics were to be read with full gesture and if possible in voices simulating the spirit and sex of each character , especially the female ones , like Miss Lace and Daisy Mae , to whom it was impossible to give credence if they spoke in baritone . Furthermore , it was cruelly difficult to understand the narrative without a sense of what had gone before  --  before , that is , Lichenko had come West  --  synopses must be furnished , and definitions . For example , who really was Skeezix ? A typical American ? A character to identify with , or one to hold in secret contempt ? He insisted grimly on secret : one was not so stupid asp200to think you could sneer openly at a feature of an official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he claimed to be too weak nowadays for chess  --  which Lichenko scattered across the foul sheets in Russian arrangements , for games that three hours hence Schild would savvy no better than at the outset except to know he was loser and must pay , the fee being invariably fifty marks , arrived at by a computation as exotic as the game . Nursing his patient of course demanded more time than Schild 's Army duties would allow , and no one was quicker to see this than St. George , as soon as the morning after the beating . " Oh Nate , " he said , looking away , for he could not have met Schild 's eye with anything but reproach , and he was the soul of tolerance , " Nate , take a few days off to look after the little fellow . " Conjure with this : a captain of Intelligence , the commanding officer of a unit of the United States Army , a career officer  --  he still had never inquired why Lichenko was a guest in the first place . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of petrifaction , was arrogance : He asks us to believe that he , and he alone , knows the Way , and if we do not admit this , he will not admit that we are fellow human beings . ' Schild had read that somewhere long ago , had banned its source from his memory  --  very likely some renegade , they were always eloquent ; of course if he wished he read them , too , he was no Catholic with an Index  --  but afterwards carried its indictment with him , like a pocket rule , speaking to it on occasion : You talk of arrogance , you , in your arrogant assumption that we suppress all doubt ; we at least have the humility to abandon our selves . He asked it now : And what of St. George , l'homme moyen sensual , could there be a more ruthless overbearing than that on which his bovine assurance was fixed ? In his mood Schild held it outrageous that St. George had not that first morning after Lovett 's party turned in Lichenko to the MPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear duty , the Yalta Agreement standing as witness . Indeed , St. George could be court-martialed for malfeasance of office , were it known , and reduced to his permanent rank of PFC or whatever was the breath-taking altitudeto which he had mounted in the fifteen years before Pearl Harbor . Thus as always , Schild in his deliberations surrendered to irony , the only weapon whose victories were won exclusively from its wielder , the sword with which the Jews , like Samurai , disembowel themselves to spite their enemies . He knew now , in retroactive projection , that he had always known Lichenko was a deserter , even as early as that first rap on Lovett 's door , and in full cognizance encouraged him in the defection . He , Schild , was a traitor ; he denounced himself in the dock , took himself to the cellar , shot a revolver into the base of his own skull , and did not weep over the loss of one more counterrevolutionary . Who wept for a Jew ? He derived from the question a brutal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , scratching an itch till it bleeds . And whether it was the pain , the pleasure , or the warmth of blood that gave him courage to press on , on he went with sharp nails through the soft flesh and webbed sinews to the nerve core . In twenty-eight years , among the regiments of shadows which had come and gone , wearing whatever badge of unit  --  no matter whether Star-of-David or even hammer and sickle ; no matter whether in love or hatred , sympathy or suspicion  --  he had met one man alone who did not treat him as a Jew . Who would weep for a Jew ? Lichenko would not . Deserter , drunkard , schnorrer , leech , to the undeluded eye he was a compoundof the baser failings  --  indeed he was what Schild 's father had always predicted Schild himself would grow up to be  --  and very likely a liar as well , for when a man is one thing , it is natural to suppose he completes the series , and it seemed appropriateto Schild , perhaps desirable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was rather a coward wearing counterfeitor stolen medals . If he would grant him all , he must begin by giving him nothing . The final solution will have arrived that day on which one man admits to another that he is a Jew and the second neither laughs nor draws his revolver nor melts in feigned , or more dreadful yet , authentic sympathy , but rather collapses in boredom  --  as Lichenko at the party indicated he might if Schild said another word on the subject . In Lichenko 's egocentric vision he knew now that he had never been more , or less , than a host fat for the parasiting , a mere object , a thing to be used , not comrade nor ally , not even a man  --  and therefore not a Jew . Lichenko was the new man who had sprung , unarmed , from the forehead of the Idea , with no chains , no history , and a concernonly for himself , the product of a proposition that worked . Never say that new kinds of creation are impossible ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man with the sensibility of a bridge , without debts , incapable of guilt , and lacking all purpose beyond his immediate function  --  and therefore neither a Jew nor interested in one . It had been worth the effort , was Schild 's thought , and the thought was also new : for not one moment of his service had he sought any manner of payment , any proximate hope . One day in August 1939 , Ribbentrop 's plane descended on Moscow , where the airport building flew the swastika and the band played the Horst Wessel Song , Molotov called fascism a matter of taste , and Stalin signed the pact with Hitler . In New York , Schild straightaway joined the Party . Truth is never literal : he was already a member for some months , and his first response to the Pact was a suicide of all that was not his body . If a universal proposition is true , the particular which stands under it is also true ; but if the universal is false , the particular may or may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; before it , the Hebraic superstitions were quaintly impotent.  |p203If  you say A , you must also say B. Those who are not with us are against us . What does it matter , said Lenin , how the chicken is carved , so long as it is finally in pieces ? Alternatives to these were the Munich Agreement ; Roosevelt in his wheel chair ; the furniture of the Seder  --  roasted egg , bitter herbs , piece of bone , eye of newt and toe of frog , wool of bat and tongue of dog , presided over by Schild 's father , an unbeliever ; and millions of weak little Jews chanting the Kaddish for the dead . Now they could pray for the latest corpses , those " antifascists " who fled this Party and its compact with the devil . Schild would stay . And he did not simply stay but joined , took that second breath to which all earlier belonging was mere apprenticeship . For a cause , a real cause , a man first forsakes all others to become one ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one to become many . First gives up women , if he is a monk , and then gives up the desire for women ; if a Nazi , first tolerates the murder of the Jews , and then after that second breath , himself shoots the revolver . If a Communist . . . the only virtue Schild would grant himself was that in his internal dialogues he never lied : that was for the liberals . Certainly the NKVD , like the Gestapo , pays its call without warning , in the small hours ; surely " we " have our concentration camps , our dictator , our elite , our peculiar truth which denies the witness of the uninstructed eye , and if your metier is opposition to the regime , you did no better to migrate to the Worker 's Homeland than had you tried it with Hitler . We wish to hear no exotic points of view ; we will not suffer variety ; our conscience , too , is corporate . Now we have entered into a pact with what we so much resemble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all enemies of " decency " are together in one basket . We do not cavil : it is precisely your " decency , " a world in chains , that we would destroy , and if Hitler can hasten its end , he will be used until history is ready to fling him aside . Thep204difference between us and you is that we will do anything to prevail ; between us and Hitler , that we are right . Thus had Schild accepted reality . In the destructive element , immerse ! To create that future life in which there will be no separations of one man from another , which is to say that time when no one is a Jew real or symbolic , when all the old rises and falls are planed away and men are simply man and he a stranger to passion , one must first , in the now , act upon the reverseof that vision , be separate  --  be a Jew , that is , in extremis ; if necessary , as it was , ally with an anti-Semite . Schild 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whether the end was serene he did not know , to date not having reached it . In particular , he was corrupted by a special feeling towards the Germans , throughout and in spite of the ideological transformations . With Hitler 's invasion of the USSR the pact of course fell from memory . From then until the final victory was apparent , the eye was shifted from sharp focus on **35;11418;TOOLONG the less demanding Gestalt of Germans-against-humanity , the latter represented most crucially by the Russian people , who incidentally had a government which tried new things but was essentially a Slavic branch of that general democracy now menaced by barbarism . True , to the professionals Nazism was still finance capital in the last terrible flush before death , and the Western Powers , temporarily useful , were the same thing not yet so far advanced that they themselves knew it . Nazism was fascism and fascism , capitalism ; nowhere was the specific quality of Germanness material . And no sooner did the Red Army take Berlin than it erected its billboards : The Hitlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the populace had connived with the Nazis they had seriously erred and must not now resent their rightful punishmentby the Soviet troops . But more important , what was past was past and the future stretched out bright and grand , offeringp205that great opportunity which so seldom comes to a people : to start out new , from nothing . Crushed and smoking lay everywhereat foot the best evidence of the failure of all hitherto existing societies . The Germans were wrong , and guilty  --  guilty of following an extreme reactionary in his mad-dog assault on the Socialist homeland  --  but were neither fundamentally maddogthemselves ( for peoples can be misguided but are never bad ) nor in any way hopeless of reclamation ; indeed , by so simple a measure as prompt adherence to the correct ideology they could enter immediate partnership with the Soviet Union itself , as magnanimous in victory as it was invincible in war . A historical crisis , admittedly , capitalism being done in by its inherent contradictions  --  yet why Germany ? No , excuse me , that is of course understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agony would there have its nucleus . But why the one peculiar feature . Why the Jews ? To answer the first question is not to need the second : in its desperation , crumbling capitalism will seek a scapegoat on whom to hang its failure . As simple as that , comrade , nothing Dostoyevskian  --  unless you will admit that Dostoyevsky , too , was a byproductof the social decay preceding the Revolution  --  and above all do not quote me Heine : " It is indeed striking , the deep affinity between these two ethical nations , Jews and old Germans . This affinity has no historical origin . . . basically the two people are so similar that one might regard the Palestine of the past as an Oriental Germany ... " With full respect to all cultures and races , comrade  --  after all , it was Lenin who with the brilliant collaboration of Stalin , always the foremost of his colleagues , drew up that system by which for the first time in history Russia 's many and diverse subnational cultures live today in peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including even the Volga Germans ( unfortunately the presence of certain fascist agents provocateurs and counterrevolutionaries concealed among the predominantlyp206loyal mass of the latter made necessary certain rearrangements when the area was threatened by the Hitlerite invasion , and the patriotic Volga Germans themselves requested to be transportedelsewhere in the Soviet Union , which plea was granted ; a far cry from the concentration camps to which the Nisei were sent in America ) . With full respect to all cultures , comrade , and to their interesting and colorful traditions each of which symbolizessome old socio-economic thesis or antithesis , it is fruitless and perhaps heretical to stagnate with the past . Not what peoples have been but what they will be , is our sole concern . Hatred of the Germans , therefore , is not valid , and if persisted in might become a dangerous malady . Similarly with the obsessionthat one is a Jew , which incorrectly puts too much stress on two delusions : ( 1 ) that Jews are that important , and ( 2 ) that oneself is . By the Central Committee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , and the most ruthless of the Party 's disciplinary boards , Schild had long before the arrival of Lichenko been granted only one more chance to rectify his errors . Had there been a thousand , he now realized , he would have spoiled them all , because he was not , and could never be , pure , adamant , resolute , unilateral ; that is , could not be a Lenin . Lenin was not a Jew . But Trotsky  --  yes , regard that classic example , that bright needle of a Jewish mind and its corrosion from pride , which is a Christian sin . And Milton Grossman , who at twenty-five had collected no excess in his passage through the world , who had seemed only a disembodied conscience and a pair of black eyes fixed on a morning horizon . He was to leave for Spain on a tramp merchantman of which he would say no more than that it sailed soon from Halifax . In his room behind the shop he had packed the knapsack which yet bore the symbol of the Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny , and Schild laughed , but then seeing that Milton did not , he knew it was no irony , which is the tension between the way things are and thep207way they are imagined , but rather another marker on Milton 's undeviating and dedicated road . Schild , too , had been a scout , in the same troop . It had of course degenerated by his time  --  bullying by the patrol leaders , petty thefts in the tents at the Alpine camp , obscene language and practices  --  Milton , with his thirty-six merit badges , was by then only a distant legend , and it meant nothing to the others that Schild was his friend . Not until years later did Schild come to know that at the arrival of the Miltons , too , the grosse Manner , the troop is always in decay  --  and falls again upon their passing from the scene , because without a constant image of strength before their eyes men , or boys , see nothing . At nineteen , Schild was big enough to go to Spain himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size to be in his first year at City College , to sit through purposeless lectures , to sign petitions and stand with a claque at anti-fascist rallies and peace movements and enlist in involved conspiracies to stop the Socialistcandidates for student council , to study the terrain of the essential American ground : folk songs , baseball , comic strips  --  and to report at four o'clock each afternoon to the squalid office which his father kept on Broadway just above the northern boundaryof Union Square , there to involve himself for two and a half hours in the commerce of buttons . But he was not big enough to go to Spain . It was characteristicof his friend that Milton did not suggest it . What we admire in those who stand above us is their assurance that they do , truly , see over our heads . He had similarly never suggested that Schild join the Young Communist League , never indeed that he so much as become intellectually a Marxist . Milton went towards the truth , the true was the necessary , follow if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoics , whom he had read as a college freshman and shared with Schild , then on the bottom rung of high school and still a simple idolator of athletes and a noisy drinker of cokes at Mrs. Grossman 's counter.  | " Fate leads the willing and drags the unwilling by the neck . But they both go . " It was the first genuine idea that Schild had ever heard , and its function in his Bildung was that upon its movement he had twice passed from adolescence into maturity . The second time  --  and not a piece with his second breath of commitment to the Party , because it both pre- and post-dated that event , had really no fixed duration , continued still  --  his second transformation began when he understood its heresy . Milton Grossman died in Spain , in July 1937 . As to the means of his death there could be no question ; this was one of the rare times the fact followed from the simple conditions of time , place , character . He had achieved the herohood for which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catalan field , had been apprenticeship . And so it was assumed , without the spelling out , for reports were necessarily fragmentary and cryptic , the Lincoln Brigade was outside the law of the country of its origin , and Spain under its cumulus of gunsmoke lay three thousand miles across the sea . Another year , and someone was returned , or someone knew someone who had come back , who knew someone in Valencia who had seen Milton in the hospital , felled by tetanus , and since the shortage of serum was notorious . . . . Yet the achievement was not diminished ; Byron , who had gone to fight for Greek liberty , died of meningitis , and the shorter literary dictionaries , with no space for elaboration , read : " died , for the freedom of Greece , Missolonghi , 1824. " ... but what did those rarer reference books on the shelf of some terrible agency tell of Grossman , Milton ? " Found guilty of Trotskyist wrecking . Liquidated . " " Executed after investigationuncovered his role in the conspiracy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pay of Franco . Sentence carried out , July 1937 . " Or perhaps only a sparrowtrackof cypher . The world had not become more cruel sinceitp209Byron , but its truths were more devious , less capable of proof , yet , for all that , truer . The real story of Byron , the concrete one  --  a term of Milton 's for a quality he always sought beneath the capitalist veil of lies  --  might be of another order , the mission to Greece a shabby quest of ego , a Trotskyism of that time , and who knew but what the meningitis were some Aesopian codenamefor the control of disorderly elements ' ? But surely it was unprecedented that at home a friend dare not speak his name . For Schild naturally had gone with his questions to those who returned . The cause had been lost and they were weary and older than their years , but they were also proud and illuminated with what could only be called the sad joy of men who have wet their comradeship in blood . They sang fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent in a language which was properly half-alien to the beneficiaries of their sacrifice . But for Milton Grossman not even Spanish idiom would serve . There had not , to their memory , ever been such a person , or if there had , no doubt he was overlooked in the terrible struggle against the open fascists on the other side of no-man's-land and the fifth columnists behind our own lines . Of course Schild knew of the wreckers , the anarchists , the hirelings of Trotsky , those worst of all enemies because they are one 's own kind , who extend a hand as comrades and with the other clasp their dagger . The greatness of a cause can be measuredby the decadence of its adversaries ; we can be proud of the very rottenness of those we have cast out . For all their mumbojumbo , and all matters of clerical fascism aside , the Catholics have a valid principle : he who embraces the incorrect faith in ignorance may be saved ; only he who knows the true faith and rejects it is certain to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ignorant ; like Trotsky he was all mind , his mind all blade , and that all edge , the Jewish edge . . . and behind it , the abysmal weakness.  |p210To  continue the inquiry was to make oneself suspect . And needlessly  --  for Schild asked the questions only to test the answersalready in his possession . No doubt the flaw had always been there , waiting for the day when the force of concrete , historicalevents would burst it wide . But it had been the earlier Milton in whom Schild had seen the Way , who had armed him with the weapons . There was ironical justice , but justice , in turningthem now against the too-competent teacher . And his oddest feeling was that in so doing he did Milton an honor greater than he deserved ; that in the measure of its being undeserved , Milton would be pleased ; that , finally , he deserved to be pleased . It was then , when he thought of Milton , though dead , though discredited , though renegade , as someone still to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity was the Party . The acceptance of one 's own complicity in the Party 's crimes was the only escape from knowing oneself a criminal . Fate leads the willing and drags the unwilling by the neck : ostensibly Greek , but how much closer to the long , moaning servitude of the Jews , with whom in the end Milton chose to identify . For he had written Schild one letter from Spain , a strange letter , in the early spring of ' 37 . Strange even for Milton , who was more talker than writer  --  " like Sophocles , Jesus of Nazareth , and Hitler , " as he used to say in his Bren-gun voice and then stop to catch breath before throwing it away again , eyes rising through an atmosphere of mixed slyness and purity , " all seekers of oral gratification ; you will notice none of us smoked . 0 vanitasl "  --  andhence never wrote proper letters but rather short scrawls discontinuous in thought and calligraphy , on whatever surface lay at hand and could be mailed , cigarette packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note to him ; and in Spain , until now , no letters at all . This one was pencil , on an unbleached , glazed strip , serrated across the midsection , of  --  Spanish toilet paper . " If I should notp211be at large by next Yom Kippur , read this . " On the religious holidays in New York , Milton 's observance was , dragging Schild along , to go to some lunch counter and stuff himself with pork ; his ambition at twenty had been to lay a girl between afternoon and evening prayers on the Day of Atonement ; he had never yet done this , he said , because he could not determine which was the greater sin , to screw a Jewish girl or to commit racial shame with a shiksah , for which he used the Nazi term Rassenschande . Once on that day , sitting on a bench in the middle island of Broadway , watching the promenaders in their best clothes , he said : " When at last the Messiah comes , he will be an anti-Semite . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besidesthe familiar **29;11455;TOOLONG wit , the Galgenhumorische pun like Mercutio 's : if I should not be at large , that is , if I should not be a gross Mann ; he anticipated his death . Then followed a translated quotation from a Hebrew religious poem of the eleventh century . He had returned to God . Small wonder he could not have made that candid . But an old mutual admiration of theirs had been Poe 's " PurloinedLetter " and Dupin 's theory of deception , which he explainsby a game of puzzles played upon a map . One player requires his opponent to find the name of a certain town . A novice will invariably choose the " most minutely lettered names ; but the adept selects such words as stretch , in large characters , from one end of the chart to the other . These , like the overlargelylettered signs and placards of the street , escape observationby being excessively obvious . " It was a faith that Milton spoke of , but rather one lost than another gained : . .. thou didst vouchsafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou art the God of Truth and thy prophets are true , and when thou didst not place my portion amongp212those who rise up and rebel against thee ; among the foolish people who blaspheme thy name ; who deride thy law ; chide thy servants , and deny the truth of thy prophets . They assume innocence , but underneath is deceit ; they make a show of a pure and clean soul , whilst the bright spots of the leper are concealed underneath . . . SOLOMONBEN GABIROL , died Valencia , c. 1057Lichenko stayed . To keep him was to abet a desertion from the Soviet Union . To turn him in was an admission that the hideous sacrifices which had gone into his making were not finally criminal , but useless . Milton had never been able to forgivea confusion of the two.  |p213LICHENKO  stayed . And in that staying Schild ironically discovered a focus for that energy he had ever kept on call against the grand mission . For he was , or had been , a romantic , a man to whom time now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw history as a continuous process and within that process himself as nothing , with the other eye he looked on the personal life as a series of choices culminating in an absolute , a supreme of either victory or martyrdom , a storming of some Winter Palaceor a fell day like that in 1933 when the Gestapo was unleashedon the German Communist Party . Instead , his future had arrived in the form of  --  Lichenko ; and time had stopped . Schatzi , who for all his shrewdness had not known of Lichenko until the beating , for all his eccentricity was a good Communist and had made his report ; and what he , for all his hatefulness yet a hero of the camps , thought of the newesttraitor did not figure in Schild 's reveries so markedly as that Schatzi 's long-held , unjust , fantastic suspicions of him had been confirmed and , finally , that , for the first time personally liable for an actual crime , he felt less guilt than serenity and lacked absolutelythe sense of being hunted . And most corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brook it begun to prevail over the conscience . Lichenko 's invalidismhad required only his attendance to be supremely ludicrous  --  to be , in fact , lunatic . Objectively the situation was simply a Russian slob nursed by a nervous Jew ; the first was not ill , but the second was ; and since each in his present arrangementwas necessary to the other in just that condition , both were mad . Or perhaps only Schild was , for he noticed that Lichenkop214these days never laughed ; indeed , since entering into permanent bed , and despite his abominable appearance , he had developed a dignified gravity which one who knew only the earlier Lichenko would have believed impossible . One lunchtime when , carrying the loaded tray and an under-arm burden of newspapers and magazines , Schild had difficulty at the door , Lichenko sprang from the sheets to his relief , showing not only vigor but incrediblestrength for so small a man : he took the heavy tray in one hand and the papers in the other and , studying Life 's cover titgirlas he went , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were the high altar in St. Basil 's and he Patriarch ; and immediately upon reclining was again the man so infirm that Schild must needs not only spoon the mashed potatoes into his mouth but also support his head simultaneously . Lunacy , to be sure , but Lichenko 's were not so much the doings of a lunatic  --  Schild realized , as he heard himself laughing without accompaniment from his patient  --  as those of a sane man who is humoring a lunatic . Similarly , Lichenko of an evening had invented a new amusement . He had fallen off his taste for public reading and even for cards . As to the former , he had been disillusioned by the knowledge that Skeezix lived in time , more or less relative to the limited days of actual people , had years ago at the beginning of the story been a baby , was now in his twenties , would grow old . Since fictional persons are a lie to begin with , he said , they are only interesting if they stick to it and do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise you did better to have true stories , which of course are always boring but then do n't pretend not to be . Like  --  he broke off to peer at Schild in a kind of suspicion and remark that it was possible he , Schild , would not agree , and immediately launched an attack on L'il Abner from the opposing ground : nobody could tell him an American peasant acted in that fashion . As to the cards , it was immoral to win from a man ignorant of the game ; had he known that at the outset he would not havep215played ; he might even return the winnings , as he was not a gengster , unless  --  again he stopped abruptly as if to give prominenceto his expression , which was this time a sneer ; one so broad , however , that surely its purpose was rather mock than serious . And again Schild laughed , and again Lichenko 's face returned to wood . Conversation appeared as the new entertainment . It was hardly more , being Lichenko 's questions and Schild 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schild had never known speech could be employed for amusement , at least not by him  --  he had listened to Milton ; in both the Party and the Army the human sound was used only to assent to orders from above and commandwhat lay below ; to St. George it was the minimum of small-talk to get rid of him ; his parents and sister had been great talkers in disregard of the defenseless tympanum , which was why he was not  --  since his voice had no resonance in this small room with the peaked ceiling which in the corners joined the wall a scant five feet above the floor , crowded with furniture and now with the warm congestion of dependent humanity ; althoughLichenko was not ill , it did make a difference to him that Schild was there to serve  --  these were reasons enough , if still morally inadmissible , why he should enjoy their mutual discourse . But more important was the fact that after the initial ten minutes at Lovett 's they had never really talked . An ordinary citizen of the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , he had had one under his roof for three weeks and never yet found the propitious moment to ask : what is it like , the experience of that citizenship ? Indeed , to place the query was not only an opportunity but , in the present context , an obligation , just as in Party circles in America one was under the reverse imperative not to question the mysterious figures who were manifestly Russian but carried passports bearing names like T. Smith . Before the beating , Lichenko had obviously never been in thep216mood for talk ; he had been eating , or sleeping , or washing , or scratching , or hanging over magazines or the chessboard ; and that was the answer to the question never asked : there was no question about life in the USSR , it was life with incessant activity and without doubt , and even a deserter from it , one who could not meet its demands , yet carried with him its energy . In his very exploitation of Schild , Lichenko honored his society : a bourgeois gone bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As to the other question  --  why had he deserted ?  --  the science of dialectics admitted no such concern ; Schild was not permitted to receive it into his mind ; a person was either this or that ; if that , he should either be ignored or destroyed ; the alternative , if one did neither of these , was to relate it to the fact that oneself was lost . And this Schild had already done . Now that conversation had finally come , it was appropriately on the theme of , not Lichenko , but Schild ; not on the simple deserter but on the more complex ; and Lichenko 's half of it was so shrewd that Schild briefly considered whether after all he had not been wrong about him . According to Schild 's wristwatch  --  which was strapped to Lichenko 's bony arm , having been the stake in one last game of cards before the no-gaming resolution went into effect  --  the time measured seven in the evening . The tray had been washed and lay gleaming on the dressertop , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reappear heavy with eggs , melting yellow in the centers , and oatmeal porridge slushed with milk and sugar ; in the end compartment , two pieces of white bread , thick as bricks , coated so lavishly with golden butter you could not lift them without smearing your fingers , which was as pleasant a sensation as running your hands over a woman , and though he knew that with this abundance the Americans had developed a culture of eating  --  it was some old law or another that when there was overproduction on the one hand and ap217shortage of markets on the other , a society tried to fill the gap with elaborate manners  --  and while he approved of this whole lovely ensemble of errors , he could not forbear from licking his hands . And Nathan made no objection . That , indeed , was Schild 's reaction to all of life , so far as Lichenko could see , and he wondered again why a man with such tolerance would join a band of evil thugs whose only differencefrom the other group just defeated lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Communists , too , and surely many among them who were but lately Nazis , and wait and see if it was not exactly those who were raised to power in the East Sector . Ah , Nathan , you fool ! , you who were rightly so quick to act when Vasya disgraced your house , in the big things you are truly like the silly comic strips you so dearly love to read . Look into the mirror and you will see the living Small Abner . Though not hurt ( and it was an awful strain to continue to pretend he had been ; actors justly earned higher wages than a fellow who operated a lathe ) ; although in fantastically better physical condition than he had ever before enjoyed ( for the first time he had hopes of one day becoming handsomely stout ) , the kind it was shameful to have to hide under a mock illness rather than announce with much noise and movement ; in spite of the great rewards at hand and the greater ones in promise ( if the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepy hamlet in the Black Forest and a German woman with a nice round ass and a little craft like decorating Christmastreeornaments , and a garden of cabbage and beets  --  if one lived too high he got only boils and the gout ) . . . despite every reason for being up and about , for seizing life and making it groan , he had instead chosen to play the sick hog . And it had begun to work . Nathan was a queer fish . For some reason he had buried his humanness so deep that one could bring it to the surface only by outraging him . Yet Lichenko had always known it was there ,  |p218else  he would not have taken the trouble to find it  --  and it was trouble , and Nathan was very lucky to have him . For now he had , at who could tell what final cost , at last established the conditions for that intimacy in which the truth could be aired . Seven o'clock , the good air outside the closed window , which he had not had in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Nathan had turned on the dresser lamp like the indoorman he was , and come to sit by the bed to await his , Vasya 's , pleasure . The room which had on first sight looked so grand that he assumed Nathan must share it with a regiment had truly become a home . With use , the very bedsheets , so white and hard when first entered , had softened and lost their harsh odor of bleach . Even Nathan 's sloppiness , which until the " illness " intervened he had constantly opposed , had worked to the homely purpose , the rug dark with scorchings , the rent in the curtains , the deep scratches of footboard and dresser-front catching the shadows like old scars on the faces of your loved ones ... . With a scissor-kick , as if in the water , he shot himself backwards , conking his skull on the headboard , which was not intentionalbut certainly claimed Nathan 's attention . Instantly his friend was up and arranging the pillow . " Are you hurt ? " Could Nathan truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt of another ? " Ah , no ! " Lichenko tried to joke . " The bedstead is undam-aged ! " He had got him there : Nathan fell back laughing . He himself of course did not , it being a kind of vulgarity to laugh at one 's own jokes , and instead , with serious mien , fixed the pillow from which Schild had puffed out all the good head-hollows . " Was f iir Knopf e macht I hr Vater ? " he asked . Nathan could sit in a straight chair for hours without so muchp219as crossing his legs , and he was thin , too , so that this ability owed nothing to the padding on his rump . " Oh , he does n't make the buttons . He buys them from a buttonmakerand sells them to a manufacturer of women 's dresses . If that 's confusing , do n't bother with it . Your country is mercifullyfree of the middleman . " Again Lichenko shot himself backward , but this time the pillowdulled the thud of his head hitting oak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the action away , Lichenko had shot his hand forward and asked : " What is that you say , free ... ? " " From the middleman " " So . " The olive-drab undershirt , which with drawers of the same cloth , on loan from Schild , was his costume of illness , had with the movements ridden up and constricted about his narrow chest like a dog harness . " I should have told you earlier , my dear friend , I hear what is said , but between the words sometimes comes the swoosh of the rockets : free '  --  swoosh  --  from the middleman '  --  swoosh , so that what goes into my mind is often different from what has been spoken . For example , I thought just now I heard you say someone was free in the Middle Ages . " " Haha , " laughed Nathan , but wryly . " Not being a Jesuit , I could hardly say that . " " Ah , again , another example : what I heard then was something about Jesus Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw his feet about under the bedclothes , which commotion looked as if a small animal were trapped there , and smiled helplessly . Just the thing to replace Nathan 's nervousness with the responsibilityof a job ; he could never endure being misunderstood . It was a relief to see him break the stiff column of his spine as he leaned forward and said very slowly and with the enunciation of him who speaks into an ear trumpet : " Je-su-it  --  a religious order which invented a kind of fascism four hundred years before Mussolini . "  | " Of course I knew it was something old , " Lichenko answered . " But you see a hydraulic engineer does not have time to learn much beyond the principles of his science . I . . . , my dear friend , should you be angry if I confessed to a dishonesty ? " Behind Schild 's genial facade he saw an emotion begin at the throat and descend  --  a giraffe would look like that if it swallowed a melon  --  either hatred or fear , since these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to reveal , but which of these was here operative Lichenko could not say , there being no apparent reason for either . Wishing no lies to stand between them , he had prepared merely to admit he had not read the American books they discussed at Lovett 's party , so long as the truth was out that an engineering student had no spare time . Instead , he said quickly : " I borrowed another of your handkerchiefswhile you were gone to the dining hall . I shall send you a dozen when I go  --  " For a moment he imagined he had heard himself continue with : " to America , " for suddenly that was where his fancy had fled , in just that wink of the eye he had seen himselfat the handkerchief stall in a store big as a sports arena , had gone back further to park his yellow Ford at the curb outside . He wore a tight blue suit of narrow gray stripes and a black felt hat low over his brow ; the woman at the counter believed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a silk glove , as he smiled with sharp white teeth and said " Enchanted , " or whatever was proper at such a moment , which he would know.  --  a dozen . Tell me which color do you prefer ? Always this olive , or should you like some of blue with narrow gray stripes ? " This was what he really said while Nathan loosened , sat back , and finally crossed his legs , one trouser riding up to uncover a pale shin whipped with dark hair . " You know you may take anything of mine , " said Schild , " and I 'll be disturbed only if you try to pay me back . " His incredible generosity ! It had , more than any other singleP221thing , been the cause of Lichenko 's delay . He understood that far back around the time of Jesus Christ the first Communists worked on that motive and no other , when , that is to say , they were weak and victims rather than victimizers , and it must have been splendid to live then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some time since , they had become so mixed that one could no longer take the sayings of one 's mother as a serious guide to life . For example , of Schild his mother would first make some old-peasant observation such as that a man with a high bridge to his nose was untrustworthy , or that ears set at that angle caught only evil wisdom . But if he showed his manners she would think him fine as a " nobleman , " which in her lexicon took on ever more precious connotations as she grew older and had further to look to see the lovely time of her youth when her father had one hundred per cent more land than her husband had now , since the latter owned none at all , and when the fields were the property of a handsome count who never cursed rather than a gang of rude bullies who stole nine-tenths of every harvest in the name of some swindler they called " the people . " Lichenko 's mother had been illiterate . She had gone under orders to night school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still been illiterate  --  according to his brother , who belonged to the Party and , being very literate , wrote articles on agriculturalmatters for a newspaper in Kiev , which Lichenko , perhaps because he himself was only moderately literate , could never read beyond the first paragraph : " The representative liaison committeefrom the Stalin Collective Farm at Rusovo yesterday presented to the Central Organization of Rural Co-operative Societiesa voluntary petition from the Third Link of field workers on the Stalin Collective Farm that it be permitted to raise its quota in regard to the harvest of wheat . Now , what does this mean relative to the development of large-scale socialist productionin the sphere of agriculture ? This means ... " Or take his brother  --  now you would assume he and Schild ,  |p222being  political comrades , would hit it off . But , ah no , his brother had no respect for foreigners , Communists or not , as he had once admitted to Vasya ; indeed , he placed little value on any people but the Great Russian and had got so that just before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , to understand Nathan one must regard him with one 's own eyes : it was the generosity , not the Communism , that was native to him , and if you said well , the Americans have so much they can afford to give some away , you had only to compare him with another like Captain St. George to see the difference . Nathan lived like a holy man of yore . " I suppose your dearest wish is to return to your family now the fighting is over , " he said , straightening the undershirt . " Tell me of them . Your sister  --  is she beautiful ? Is she so slender ? You have a photograph , of course . " " No  --  well , I did have , " Schild spoke in concern , " but in the area of Metz my belongings were stolen . " " And your mother  --  can she read and write ? No , do n't answer . How silly of me to ask ! A fine , cultivated noble  --  gentleman like you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This seemed to soothe Schild , and his black eyes glowed behind the lenses as he protested happily : " Not at all . There are about ten or twelve million Americans who can not read and write . We are not speaking now of the Soviet Union , Vasili Niko-laievitch . " " But then it is not necessary for everyone to read and write , " said Lichenko , shrugging with his voice . " All one really needs is something to eat and wear  --  protection from the golod and kholod , as one says in Russian  --  girls to love , maybe a drink of spirits now and again , and the policeman not on your tail . I mean , if one belongs to the common people . " Schild assented by his silence . " The uncommon ones , " Lichenko went on , " take care of themselves . Then there are the ones between , who do n't know what they want , nicht wahr ? Something different , anyway ; this is notp223right and that is not right . Nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyful hopelessness , pedaling his legs rapidly as if riding a bicycle . " But look at a big oak tree : it loves no girls , drinks only water , does not eat at all , lasts longer than the oldest man , and is satisfied throughout . " " And is chopped down by the first fellow who needs wood , " said Schild , nodding pleasantly . His shirt pocket might be unbuttoned , but his tie and collar were fast and most uncomfortable to see through the heavy , still air . Keeping the windows shut had been a phase of Lichenko 's scheme of absolute pressure to the body as well as the spirit , and while no effect could be discerned in Schild , he himself was sweating like a plowhorse . " Yet , " Nathan continued , not so much as a gloss on his steep forehead , " is n't even that oak better than a worker under capitalism ? , who is chopped down when he is not needed . " " Stupid ! " " Yes , stupid is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He saw even a tree politically , and no doubt would be the first to cut down an oak , to make paper for pamphletsto celebrate someone else 's sowing of the reclaimed ground , or to denounce them for seeding the wrong thing , whicheverwould be most bleak and deadly and contradictory of his generous heart . There was a difference of thousands of meters , in more than land and sea , between him and Lichenko 's brother , in spite of their similar faiths . His brother had , all to himself , a four-room apartment with a refrigerator and a private bathroom , but what had Schild to gain ? He even disapproved of his father 's wealth . " It would be better , I think , if the window were open . " Lichenkoscrubbed his face with the undershirt tail , which when he pulled it down again was wet as a swimming suit , and since by that time Schild had opened one half of the casement and the evening air made chill entry , his belly was shortly cramped with cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close it . "  | " You have n't a fever ? " asked Schild as he came back to his chair softly as a cat . " Frankly , I do n't know . I feel very strange . Perhaps I should take a bath . . . . Of course you have a bathroom in your home in the U.S.A. And with hot water , no ? Schon ! " " But there are many people who have not . My grandparents lived in the working-class quarter of New York City , in unbelievableslums . They had nothing but a cold-water flat , one room for living and sleeping , and the other a combination kitchenbath . The tub had a wooden cover that served as dining table . " " Wundervoll ! " Lichenko chortled . " I knew it ! They were workersand yet had a private bath , and their son grew up to be a great industrialist of buttons and his son became a fine intellectual . " He saw a cruel angle develop in the corner of Schild 's mouth , at odds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been carried away as usual : fact , fact was wanted and not his opinions , which only irked his friend in the proportion they were genuine . He writhed about until his feet hung over one side of the bed and his head , the other . In upside-down vision Schild looked like a baldheaded man with a beard  --  indeed , somewhat like a Lenin with glasses . He had played this game as a boy : if you frowned , the lines of the forehead resembled a mouth ; the real mouth you must ignore , and also that the nose opens in the wrong direction ; with the remainder you had a fairly credible face which gave to the expressions what the Moscow radio gave to the truth  --  an odd twist , both human and not . It was years since he had played it , however , and he had lost his old proficiency in interpretation . " What are you doing now ? " The mouth in the center of Schild 's head answered : " I 'm smil-ing . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain myself while you are gone I have remembered certain boyhood amusements . " He righted himself , all hot above the neck , and sighed . " When I was sick as a child my mother sang little songs to me.  |p225They  were always about food . For the life of me I can not now recall a note , or I should sing one . They only come back when I am hungry . " Schild bathed in a pond of jocularity as he said : " Then we shall have to starve you . " " No , " Lichenko answered , " that has already been done , and believe me , my friend , just for the singing it is not worth it . " It was aired , his first open attack on the regime of his country ; he felt excellent well for having made it , and he stared fearlesslyat Schild , who appropriately cast his eyes aside in deep embarrassment . Which meant he knew , then , of the Kremlinmadefamine of 1933 , and it meant as well that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet if Nathan did know and , regardlessof a disapproval however sincere , continued to work for those devils who had not only created the famine but standing on two million corpses denied they were there . . . Lichenko lost the path as all at once he found he wanted Schild to be both innocent and guilty , for only in that combination could he forgivehim . But Nathan was neither . So solemnly eloquent he almost cracked one 's heart , yet with a peculiar elation that seemed to swell his own , he spoke of Hitler 's assault on the USSR and the scorched-earth tactics and withdrawals which , because of the treacherous surprise , had been at first the Soviets ' only defense . He spoke well ; indeed , so well that Lichenko almost believed the hunger here at issue was rather that of 1941 than 1933 . No question that the invasion by the Germans had been worse than living under Stalin : they were foreigners . Yet , although the data was of course suppressed , hundreds of thousands of his compatriotshad had another opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vlasov 's anti-Kremlin army or even in the Wehrmacht . They were wrong . If you must have a tyrant , why not keep your own ? He could not help it , he still had scruples about disabusingp226Schild . The Red Army , as Nathan was saying , had done a magnificentjob ; they were heroes ; he , Vasya , was a hero and it was just and proper to hear someone say so . The Soviet Union was the greatest country in the world : there lay no contradiction betweenbelieving that and fleeing to America , or the Black Forest , or some southern land where dark-complexioned people drank wine and slept all day in the shade . And it was very probable that the Party elite represented a new and superior kind of man . He even believed Bolshevism would triumph in the long run , everywhere , because he could see in it no weaknesses and knew by experience it would stop at nothing . Even Hitler had a limit : the Germanic " race , " by which he measured everything , includinghis Ukrainian allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . He was wrong . The Communists , however , were right  --  oh yes , no doubt even the famine was correct from the high point of vantage , the Kremlin had its eye always on the main chance , for there in the grave lay Lichenko 's father and mother , who starved , yet there was he , son and heir , fewer than ten years later at the breech of the rocket gun , fighting loyally to save Moscow , and Stalin , from the enemy . Communism , Nathan , is never wrong  --  as you would immediatelyagree but not understand  --  because its only principle is success . bust as yours is failure ; what you really love is not the Red Army 's victories but the sacrifices and agony required to achieve them . How you would have approved of the famine ! .. . But the point I wish to make is that Stalin and his gang neither liked nor disliked starving two million people . They saw it as necessary to their plan that they requisition more foodstuffs than the peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they simply did not care . Communism is never wrong , Nathan , because it has no feelings at all , certainly no good ones , but no bad ones either  --  none at all . It is difficult to tell you that , be/cause I have and you have , and furthermore I am a man without ambition and thus discredited . The unspoken rang so loudly against his frontal bone that Lichenkocould hardly believe Schild had not heard it , too ; crystalline , cold , and true it was , like the sound of a gong made of glass . And he had never been a great one for thinking , which was his brother 's talent . Once before the war his brother in a literary phase had read a book called The Idiot by a writer towards whom his brother had mixed feelings  --  saying on the one hand he did show a consciousness of something , although on the other he was of course hopelessly something and you could not look to him for something else  --  at any rate , in an unusually amiable mood he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer he thoroughly disapproved : this Idiot , who if that were not enough was also a prince , appropriately found everything strange ; but one evening in Switzerland , where typical of the decadent Russian nobilityhaving nothing else to do he went to drink sulfur-water or whatnot , he heard the bray of an ass in the marketplace : " I was immensely struck with the ass , and for some reason extraordinarilypleased with it , and suddenly everything seemed to clear up in my head . " Following the quotation his brother observed that heavy silencewhich means such nonsense speaks for itself . To Vasya it had said nothing until this moment more than five years later when , without the ass 's aid , he found himself in the princely condition . Everything seemed to clear up . . . . He had stayed on not to save Schild but to understand him , not because Schild was good but rather because he was interesting . It was the game of the Communists , who were never wrong , to save people . For an ordinary man , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellowused the privilege and obligation of life , which was not the best thing imaginable , but we none of us  --  his brother , Stalin , Hitler , the Americans , the prince  --  had anything else.  |p228Naturally  , Nathan had not heard . That inner ear through which the rest of humanity hears the most important sounds is confiscatedwhen one joins the Communists . He had often confirmed this by speaking silently to his brother : " You bastard , the only reason I would n't shoot you if I had the chance is that we have the same blood . " Results always negative , despite his brother 's noted gift for smelling out heresy . However , Schild had picked up a subtler noise which Lichenkomissed . His voice became furtive as he left the siege of Stalingrad to warn : " St. George is coming upstairs . " At last Lichenko heard the footsteps , which being both heavy and soft like those of any large animal but the horse , were unmistakable : those shoes which he so coveted , with their fat soles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run right up a smooth wall . Why Schild should think St. George a menace , however , was far from clear  --  if at the same time , as Nathan insisted , and Lichenko had to agree , the captain was also a fool . But a good fool , a jovial one , at least wise enough not to try to be clever . He did not even suspect he had a political as secondin-command , and was the happier for it . In a Russian company the most harmless-looking boob was invariably the secret-police informer . The wonderful American invention was a man who looked his role . He lay badly in need now of just the neutrality that St. George dispensed . He readied his mouth to call " Kom een ! " his pronunciationof which the captain never failed to approve ; he was already enmired in St. George 's warm sludge , that secure , absolute , fool 's medium in which all was forever orderly  --  when , just as the footfalls reached the door , darkness smothered him in its close sheet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was blacker still , for even a night swollen and dim with cloud has its suggestions of distant fire . Damn you , Nathan , for extinguishingthe lamp on a friend ! Now what had been merely neces/sary became imperative . He called to St. George and could not hear his own voice ; he strove to rise but lost the first fall to inertia , the second to his knotted bedclothes , and won the third only to hear his quarry pad beyond the bend of the hall . Neverthelesshe got to the lamp , eerily not meeting Schild on the way , choked the button in its narrow throat , making light  --  of which he had the conviction it would reveal nothing but a chamber enclosing only himself . Yet there sat Nathan on his hard chair , on his cast-iron behind , and looking not at all guilty , when for once he should have , but rather self-righteous . " Yes , it 's all right now , " he said . " Ice 's gone to his room . " In the interval of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its weak yellow into a splendid flare  --  only to lose the contest to Schild 's face , which like unpolished bone claimed all the light and gave none back . He had never looked more saintly . " But come , " he said , rising to Lichenko 's aid and fading quickly into his old contrition . " You should n't be up  --  you 'll take a chill . " He offered to support him and , when that was spurned , walked before , as if he were clearing a channel through some invisible marsh between the dresser and bed ; alone and unwittinghe went , and no one followed . For Lichenko had turned to the big clothes cabinet in the corner next the window , turned the key , and peered into its cavern which gave the illusion of a vaster space than the surroundingroom . At one end of the rod Schild 's uniforms hung unruly , as if rifled by a thief . At the other , his own , which seemed unusually small upon its hanger ; and his boots , bow-legged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do not see my cap , and I can not go without it , " he said , into the depths but to Schild . " Oh yes , " Schild answered , in a strangely strong voice . " You will want your cap . Is n't it there on the shelf ? "  |p230Surely  it was ; he had forgotten the single shelf across the top of the cabinet , perhaps because he was too short to use it , but the edge of the cap 's shiny visor poked an inch beyond the board , like the nose of a midget peeking down from hiding , and he seized it . Upon his head the cap was tight , since he had not had a real haircut for three weeks , only Nathan 's trim-job around the ears with a little sewing scissors . He also got into his boots , balancing badly on one leg at a time  --  you can not live abed for more than a day , even faking , and not feel giddy on your feet  --  and then seeing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap , olive-drab shorts and undershirt , and boots , he groaned at his stupidity and sat upon the floor . Schild came to him and , bending over , grasped his left heel and toe. " 1 ' 11 pull and you pull , and off it comes . Ready ? " Before he could answer , Nathan did his part unaccompanied ; off it came and then the other . " Now , " said Schild , " we 'll just put these back into the cabinet where they ca n't be scuffed . And the cap , too . You wo n't want to get it full of lint . " He plucked it from Lichenko 's head and ran his elbow across it twice . " Do n't crush my cap , " Lichenko shouted . " Ah no , this is how they brush hats in the fine American stores . " " How am I to know that ? " Seizing his hand , Schild brought him upright . " What you do know is that I have no reason to ruin it , nicht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . " He looked very scholarly as he replaced the cap on the shelf . At the angle Lichenko saw that his glasses were covered with a film of dust and at least one fingerprint , distinct in oil . " Why do n't you clean your spectacles ? " he shouted angrily . " You ca n't see out of your own head ! " Carefully , Schild unhooked the temple pieces from behind hisp231ears , and painstakingly shined the lenses with the small end of his straw-colored necktie , which tonight as usual was twisted ahead of the larger . Lichenko turned aside , embarrassed by the naked face , saying : " You should not have done that to the captain . " " Then come , " Schild offered , the glasses yet in his fingers , " we shall go and apologize to him ; I mean , we 'll go and 1 will apologize , and you can see his feelings have n't been hurt . " " Oh , I 'm sure of that . " He reached up under the tunic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No matter where he wandered hence he would never find another man so alert to his moods and purposes , but was that not the trouble ? " Yes , " Schild reassured , " he is just a person . . . . But whatever are you doing ? You are ill , my friend , and must not worry about your uniform . As you can see I have taken good care of it . Look at the blouse  --  as clean and pressed as new , eh ? And the medals  --  only yesterday I sponged the ribbons with gasoline . How bright their colors are ! See the Order of the lied Banner  --  " Lichenko sidestepped him and struggled into the breeches . After the fly was fastened he could hardly get a hand into his pocket , so American had been three weeks of meals  --  and that , too , was the trouble . He withdrew a wad of marks and thrust them at Schild . " Here is payment for the underwear and handkerchiefs and whatever else I have taken , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheated in those games  --  silly , no ? , since I could have beaten you anyway , still I could not resist when it was so easy . But there you have it all back again . " He threw the bills upon the dresser . " Yes , the cards ! " Schild said , desperately exuberant . " We 'll have a three-handed game of something and get old St. George  --  you 'll see he is n't hurt in any way  --  and take his money . He 'll like that , he 'll do anything for company . " " As to your personal kindness , " Lichenko continued , reachingp232for his blouse , " there is no repaying that , not when one understandswhat kindness is , a thing which should make the giver feel good or he should not do it . " He said more as he crumpled the blouse over his head , but could not hear it , himself . He was so sick of himself he feared he might vomit on the very uniform whose smartness he also owed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a slow disease but is felt as an instant affliction , and comes more violently in rooms than on the fields of battle ; at Kursk , when a Tiger tank broke rumbling and malignant through to their artillery position , he had leaped upon the deck and dropped a grenade down its throat ; in gemiitlich Zehlendorf he could not even stave off the insulting of a fool , much less tell the cold truth to a friend . " Come , " said Schild , who looked now as if he were drunk or , rather , pretending to be drunk and wild , in the manner of some honor student ostentatiously letting down his hair at the end of term . " St. George has a bottle . . . " He rolled his eyes in what he surely meant as license , but to Lichenko they suggested those of a horse gone mad with fright . Fright ? Why should he be afraid , the one who was n't taking a risk ? Or did his odd sympathy even extend to Lichenko 's future troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , most people had had to struggle all their lives without his help . For the first time he was struck by Nathan 's incredible arrogance . He buckled on the wide dress belt and strung the breast strap through the epaulette on his right shoulder , and reached again for the boots , which Nathan still held . But Schild swung them behind his back , like a child , saying : " First let 's have that drink . " " No , Nathan , I am not fooling any more . " He took the boots from him and this time sat down upon the bed to pull them on . " I shall say goodbye to the captain but I want no drink . " He needed only three drops of spirits to fall unconscious ; his head already felt like an electric-light bulb , hot , light , empty , fragile ,  |p233and  loose where it screwed onto his neck ; a moment somewhere back he had discovered he was ironically and genuinely ill . " Goodbye ? " asked Schild , his voice very ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , and he pressed it out sweeter for the rest : " Where can you go ? " He did not wait for a reply  --  beingalready in possession of all answers to all questions ; indeed , it was mere courtesy that he had put the statement in the interrogative . " Almost anywhere but home , " said Lichenko , grinning weakly , trying to , at any rate , as his head slowly unscrewed and Schild 's image kaleidoscoped with the vivid colors of the hair-lotion bottleson the dressertop . Nevertheless his mind stayed clear . " You son of a bitch . " Nathan had spoken in English , that flat , nasal language in which nothing sounded either interesting or important ; and so far as he could see him through the spinning , his expression followedsuit . Lichenko grinned again , hard and acid , but this time within his own heart and on the terms of his own failure . In the end , how he had conducted himself did not matter , that was the funniness of it and also the horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through the neck of the smallest one : you can not stir the curiosity of a corpse . He would leave in a moment . As soon as he recovered his balancehe would get his cap from the cabinet and walk through the door , down the stairs  --  the German woman , he reflected , handsomeif too thin , would continue to go to seed  --  and stand upon the threshold , facing outward . One could hope the night was not windy ; the world seemed larger when the wind blew , especially if the sky was dark and you could see so little that was permanent . Other persons feared lighting bolts , sunstroke , drowning , snakebites  --  he had always had fantasies of being blown away in a gale . In a moment . . . already he could feel the strength rising from somewhere down about his ankles , which were firm in the goodp234old boots . You could n't beat boots , which would hold you erect when you were limp with exhaustion . He could not believe that the Americans , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him a long time in the same blank way , Nathan had suddenly turned towards the dresser lamp , seized the wad of Occupation marks , and begun to count . It would be an impressive sum , for what Lichenko had won in the cards from Schild were just a few negligible leaves around the fat core of the bonus he had been paid on the day of Lovett 's party . The regular pay , in rubles , was allegedly deposited at home against one 's return ; these marks , intended to be spent in Germany , had on some guarantee of the Americans been printed wholesale and cost the Red Army nothing . They also , if he knew his bureaucratsand their ingenious scheme of allotments , were very likely all one would ever get in his hand . For him , of course , the matter was now academic . He would face the world with empty pockets and without a plan . This , he realized , in a chill about the kneecaps which was closer to a falling nerve than a rising strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of it is yours , " he said faintly , for part of him was in that state of freedom while the rest held tenaciously to the here-and-now , and his voice was not strong enough to sound both places with the same volume . " Count it , keep it , spend it . Money is a good thing , especially for a person of your type . " He meant : it may not be grand or powerful , but it is human to know the price of beans . As if he had arrived at the total , Schild nodded to himself and rerolled the bills . " Thank you , " he said quietly . " We are quits . And now if you can spare a minute I must get St. George to come and say hisLebewohl . " " Lassen Sie Bich Zeit , " Lichenko answered , " take your own good time . " He lay back across the bed and closed his eyes ; hep235I felt a small object drop upon his chest and separate like a broken egg ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . " Well , " St. George had said to Schild , " I did wonder if he had permission to stay this long away from his company . I did think it was funny . " In his pajamas  --  his alternate set , of vertical green and white stripes  --  lipping an unlighted pipe , smelling of mouthwash , he stood sagging near his window just opened over the black-quiet yard . " But desertion ! I hope you 're certain about that . Or rather , I hope you are wrong , because he is a nice fellow . " He anyway had to sleep the night on it . Schild neither slept nor tried to , nor could have said how he passed the hours of darkness , for they were too grievous small : a turn of the corridor and already the bathroom window was mother-of-pearl ; another , and five o'clock had surely come . Silentlyhe crept into St. George 's room and took up the wristwatchfrom the bedside table , held the cold snake of its expansionbracelet : only four o'clock in Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain , who took his warnings with a face like a stale onion roll and at last rose , puffing and aged , to stuff himself into the uniform . " Boy oh boy , " said St. George when he was dressed . " Here 's a time I would give these bars to anyone who would take them . This is a lousy business I have to do , Nate . You should be glad you 're out of it . " He made a pot of his overseas cap and drew it on . " God knows what they 'll do to him . I do n't think Russia 's much of a place . " " But then you did n't make the regulations , did you ? " asked Schild , as he pressured him , without touching , to the door . " I guess that 's how to look at it . " With a foot into the hall , though , he recoiled and , whispering , brushed Schild 's ear with his earnest , bulbous nose : " But does he know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hardly tell him . "  |p236He  ate this thought like a caramel and , swallowing it , grimaced , and then going into a profound melancholy moved with heavy hump of shoulders towards the staircase . Within the hour two military policemen  --  Americans : Schild had somehow believed they would be Russian  --  came in tall , thin , and bored from the street , mounted the stair with drawn pistols on white lanyards . . . and soon descended supporting Lichenko between them , for , still in half-sleep , he could not walk erect and would not try to see with his eyes . Yet at the threshold he straightened , jerked his arms from captivity to fix his cap , said " Ladno ! " the Russian okay , and walked unassisted in the new , barren day . St. George had not returned . His mouth metallic with want of rest , Schild mounted to the room which he had not seen since the evening before and in which he had not been alone for three weeks . Scattered across the bed he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst when he threw it . He believed that he should burn them straightaway , but as he stooped to the gathering the door downstairs made its sound and he was hailed by a raucous American voice . The taller MP stood wide-legged and screamed up the stairwell : " Lootenant , did that fuckin ' Communist steal your wristwatch ? He 's wearing a gold Bulova . " " No , " said Schild , after a moment . " I sold it to him . " He thought : I will never know how long it might have gone on if he had not made that crack about Jews and money.  |p237CONSIDERED  as a unit , Reinhart and Very were some twelve feet , three hundred and forty pounds of person , and , as the beast with two backs , would have ranked in the hierarchy of animal size just after the whale , the Indian elephant , and the hippopotamus . Their coupling , however , was apparently not to come  --  unless it was she who overwhelmed Reinhart  --  for all day now he ached with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further sport at the office , but immediately after work each afternoon he had been calling at Trudchen 's little room down the hall , to vault between her soft legs in a ferocity which , though it had long left reason behind , never stayed her call for more and worse . Indeed , it had become S.O.P. for her , just before the climax , to scream into his ear : " You do n't hurt me enough ! " and drive her small fangs into the lobe , which , while it is that portion of the human surface with the fewest nerve endings and correspondingly insensitive , still feels pressure and can swell fat and red with mistreatment and make you look odd as you go about your other business . But all in all Reinhart felt very natural and right about the arrangement , as one can only when he so adjusts his life as to be dirty on the one hand and clean on the other  --  a sort of Renaissanceideal  --  and therefore hypocritical on neither . With Trudchenthere was no pretense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although , not being a brute or a pervert , with the former he did not withhold " love "  --  he was very kind to Trudchen  --  and with Very his imagination was not so barren as to exclude " sex "  --  he after all kissed her rather more than he did Trudchen , if not in so French a style , and who knew what random transport might seize her in some propitious time and place ? Meanwhile , it wasp238satisfaction of a kind of lust merely to be with her , to have her seen at his side by resentful others . Though they were not flagrant : in public they never held hands . And usually they were in public : for one , because even in Berlin , with its acres of forests and ruins , even if you could drag a respectable girl through stocking-snagging jungles , people abounded  --  Germans of course did not count , but Americans were behind each tree and in the hollow of every bomb crater  --  for another , having no strong need to tumble her , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , the Nazi monuments . Pound 's and his tour had at last moved from paper to actuality . One Sunday shortly past noon two of the small vehicles termed " weapons carriers , " the parallel benches in their roofless beds creaking with packed behindsin olive drab , tooled from Zehlendorf to the now deranged nerve center of Hitler Germany . Very 's turn was like the stately movement of a world-ball on its axis  --  not a petty soccer-sized globe , mind you , but the grand sphere that dominates some centennial exposition  --  as she descended from the truck on the same helpful hand that Reinhart , as official guide , had granted the other nurses in the party . Her other difference was that she gave his fingers a pronounced squeeze , which not only brought pain to his knuckles but also impatience to his heart : there they were , in the great chaotic plaza before the ruined Chancellery and she was obviously unmoved . Not to mention that she had given , he had seen  --  for on general grounds it was a pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the series : Brandenburg Gate , Unter den Linden , entrance to the Wilhelmstrasse , Hotel Adlon , Foreign Office , Propaganda Ministry ; had instead touched her cap , flicked her lapel , straightened her skirt , and coughed ladylike behind satiny nails . Now she nicely picked , with the others in the party of fourteen , across the center island nasty with torn Volkswagens andp239an Opel , on its side , showing naked steel supports for a roof long gone , and a lamppost twisted and wilting like a licorice whip on end ; in her turn presented the long red pass to the inevitable tommygun Russians at the Chancellery door and was , with stupid , mammary ogling , admitted . Reinhart clove to her side , and the others , officers , nurses , and enlisted men , clung to his ; shortly they were all lost together in a choppy surf of crushed marble through which black wires squirmed like sea-snakes . And as quickly were again found , in a vast chamber of pale-gray mosaic , where a skylight of ten thousandbroken panes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that met the shrapnel-pitted wall . They stood there , the fourteen , in a noisy , echoing silence of rubber heels abrading marble , inhaling the sour white dust which floated on the air like steam in winter , in their awe daring nothing but to take this polluted breath and give it back at the proper intervals . Over the doorway , a mile down a runway of litter fifty feet wide and to the depth of a horse , the Nazi eagle of stone-and-gildedbronze . Besides themselves , no man . Naturally , thoughts of a mighty morality spilled into Reinhart'smind , through , as it were , the skylight : if you seek his monument , look around you ; Ozymandias , king of kings , etc. ; living and dying with and by the sword . And PFC Farnsworth T. Cronin , who had majored in political science , in Massachusetts , and who at this moment subtly wedged himself between Reinhartand Veronica , intoned softly : " Power corrupts , and absolute power corrupts absolutely . " Sidestepping , Reinhart eased over to Very . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vault , his bootheels echoingfor ten minutes before you could see him ? He must have looked pretty insignificant in his own house . " " Who ? " asked Very , throwing highlights off the undercushion of her scarlet lip . " Oh you mean Hitler . But did he live right here in the Reichstag ? Must have been drafty , haha . "  |p240If  you were careless you might identify as imbecility that which was rather inattentiveness ; before penetrating the BrandenburgGate , they had swung left up the squalid lane to the old Reichstag ruin , a long , columned cinder surmounted by a dome burned to chicken wire and facing a park of weeds . In his ciceroneremarks Reinhart attributed its burns to a fire set by the Nazis in 1933 . Cronin corrected in a voice flat with certainty : " No , it was restored after that . What you see here came from the bombings and the Russian assault this spring "  --  he had apparentlysnooped in all these places before the tour got under way , while the real men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just as well this all had eluded Veronica , who also probably failed to notice that thereupon Reinhart suppressedthe remainder of his own commentary , not only for the Reichstag but the succeeding buildings as well . " My fault , " he said now , manfully . " This is the Chancellery . " " The What-cellery ? " But he saw in her blue eyes a candid fooling . " Of course , " said Cronin , studying the mosaics with his bland face , " we are in the New Chancellery which Hitler built circa 1938-39 . The Old one , dating from the time of the Hohenzollerns , is next door . " Cronin never put his eyes on a person ; meetingone on the arctic tundra , with nothing else to look at , he no doubt would try to inspect the wind . A tedious creep , yet you could tell by the measure of his tediousness that he did know whereof he spoke ; it were destructive vanity not to use him for what he could provide . " If you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth seeing . " " Well , the terrace and garden are certainly there , " Cronin answered , almost , in his pleasure , giving one a fair shot at his face , but not quite . " Then lead on , McSnerd , and make a trail through the swamp ! " said Very , sending her chime like a bowling ball down the mar/ble gallery . And this time Cronin looked full face , demonstrating above it a dun-colored scalp parted dead center , like a statesman of the Harding era , and wondering , Amherst eyes : wondering not only who she was but why . Eventually they crossed a hall of massive pillars , where Russiannames , in their queer letters sometimes just eluding comprehensionby a hair , were scratched into the bomb-sprayed walls and from a ceiling of bare girders loose power cables swung like thin pythons anxious to drop upon a meal . And , as a thick , sifting carpet , the usual litter of broken stone , plaster powder , splintered wood , and piecemeal metal , in a quantity which if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into its original forms would twice exceed them , for no fecundity can match disintegration 's . Reinhart thought about this , but it was Very , with her fine intuition , who said : " Why when things are broken do they seem like more than when they 're together ? " " Du n no , " answered Cronin , who had apparently determined her quality and was peculiarly intrigued by it  --  he was breaking a trail through the trash , as she had asked , and just for her , while the others mushed ankle-deep  --  " no doubt the air between the pieces . " " I do n't read you . " She stepped to the French window , of which Cronin opened and held the shutter and then caught her arm : beyond its threshold was a two-foot drop to the terrace floor . Meanwhile , Reinhart bulled on through and nearly broke both ankles but recovered with the gay veldt-bound of a springbok . Coming back , he raised his hands under Very 's elbows and loweredher like a light barbell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cronin , who took it ! , being indecently beyond that kind of vanity . As the others tumbled through each in his own fashion , a nurse named Lieutenant Leek despite support turning her foot , the triop242of leaders waded across the terrace and into the junkyard garden of sand , dismembered trees , disjunctive wheels and pipes and tin air ducts , disjected planks ; blooming out of these , in the dirty fungus-white of sunless growths , two concrete structures , pocked by shot , seared by flame , sprouting excrescences of scaffold and webbed iron , yet squatted conditionally whole . On the left  --  they had come round to the far side  --  was Hitler'sbunker , according to Cronin , who named the other , a cylinderwith conical roof , as a sentry blockhouse manned by the SS until the eleventh hour . In the deep embrasure of the bunker entrance a detached steel door stood angled ; next to it at the same degree slouched a Mongol guard , who at their appearance sullenly presented his shoulder blades and a view of trousers-rear seemingly heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted Reinhart . " Yes , " said Cronin to a length of corroded pipe lying at hip feet , " he should be wearing a J. Press jacket and white bucks . " Although his statement was cryptic , his emotion was not : when he looked towards the guard his eyes were filmy with approval . Then , in the self-congratulatory manner of a white man extendingcommon courtesy to a Negro , he plunged across the debris to the doorway , open pack of cigarettes at the ready position , loudly saying : " Z-DRAHST-voo-ee-tee , ta-VA-reesch , KAHK pa-jee-VA-yee-tee ? " You could hear all the stresses of the little Russian phrasebook distributed a month earlier by Reinhart 's department . The Mongol revolved instantly and gave him the submachinegunmuzzle big as a megaphone and all perforated with dimesizedair vents , more death-ray than gun , and if a man ever meant to squeeze the trigger , it was he . But Cronin was a stranger to cowardice ; with inexorable good will he advanced , and the Mongol , though snarling imprecations in a tongue that sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Reaching the entrance , Cronin pressed the smokes at him as one might a cross upon a devil , engaged him in ap243going-and-coming , frustrating inquiry , and was at last driven by him into the waste of loose planks before the SS turret , where Reinhart and Very waited . " I 'm afraid it 's forbidden to enter the bunker , " h'e said pridefully , stepping up , as if myopic , so near that Reinhart , always uncomfortable in close approach , backed off , caught his heel in the fork of a grounded tree-branch , and freeing it too violently threw away his balance and fell backwards into a shallow trench which till then no one had marked . " But that 's the next best thing , " said Cronin , pretending not to see , or perhaps really , in his odd way , not noticing , as Very howled vulgarly and the rest of the party , clattering through the ventilating ducts , joined her in sadistic mirth , " that 's the ditch where they burned the bodies of Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gooseflesh , more historical than personal , as he scrambled slowly upwards : he had felt a distinct and depraved wish to continue lying there for a while . " Ostensibly , " Cronin went on . On the bank now , Reinhart saw in the trench 's sandy gutter only an ambiguous rubbish of dead leaves , board-ends , and fragments of paper coarsened and grayed by dried rain . Already he had become as reluctant to kneel and rummage in it as he had been , a moment earlier , to leave its placid bed . " Here , in this ditch ? " No , it was too much , along with the imperialchaos inside the Chancellery , to believe ; was rather lock , stock , and barrel a vast hoax of propaganda and journalism ; normalpeople like himself not only did not make history but did not see its leavings firsthand . " I said ostensibly , " Cronin answered . " In my opinion it was a not too ingenious device to cover his escape to South America . " " Oh you do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth yet remembering the laugh on Reinhart , as did her wet eyes , life-blue in this landscape of neutral tones canescing into time past . " If so , it worked . " Said by a newcomer to the area of thep244three , a stout captain in green trenchcoat , his shirt collar wearingthe doctor 's bare caduceus , and Lieutenant Leek hobbled up , and in another moment the others , too , lining round the pseudo grave . " Unfortunately yes , " said Cronin , although the captain had not properly addressed the comment to him , " anything German always succeeds famously with us . Give Hitler a year and we 'll welcome him back to defend us against the ' Reds . ' " Reinhart had got interested in watching the captain , whom he did not know , whose face was manifestly German-American , wide-checked , beer-florid , piggishly nostriled , stupid and good  --  what had it to say in defense of that old seed sprung from this ground and carried across the ocean to form it ? " Do you think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked in utter innocence , coloring more , for to see Cronin he had to send his eyes across Very 's Himalayan front . " Only the American Legion and the vigilantes can save us from them . First , the unions must be stamped out . . . " Cronin 's face became a mask of crafty evil , apparently mimicking a memory of Goebbels ' . " FDR has already been got rid of , thank God . " How much of the sarcasm , which Cronin injected with real ferocity , astonishing Reinhart who had not believed he could show much feeling towards anything , how much of it reached the captain it was difficult to say . Too little , Reinhart feared , and he hastened to spread it abroad that Cronin spoke in jest . " Well , " the captain answered , humorlessly shaking his thick jowls , " I do n't know it 's anything to kid about , if these Reds are going to make trouble just as soon as we get rid of this fellow . " He pointed into the depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think in the end they 'd be much better than Hitler . Did n't they make a pact with him which gave him a green light to start the war ? And then proceeded to divvy up poor old Poland , even though they later became our allies . Killing people is all any of those fellows know , robbing people and killing them ,  |p245year  in and year out , for no reason at all . I 've been a physician for seventeen years but I 've never been able to figure out what makes fellows like that  --  because that 's what they are , are n't they , just fellows , people like anybody else in the beginning . " Excellent fat captain , with your wide , honest , Nordic face : you have come through ! Reinhart watched him kneel like a barrageballoon folding , ever threatening to burst upwards again , and poke into the trench with graceful , doctor-sensitive hands that bore not an ounce of the excess flesh he carried elsewhere . Soon he discovered nothing and rose , despite his weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the unions ? I have five or six patients at home who belong to both and I also think they were good Roosevelt-Truman men , and so you 've got me all confused . " " Truman , ha ! " snorted Cronin and suddenly gave Reinhart a knowing eye ; in this matter he was willing to grant that they shared a community , and what was shameful was that Reinhart had no courage to indicate him nay , from a combination of guilt and vanity was yellow to reveal he stood with the doctor , two dense and heavy light-complexioned oafs who saw the mellow where the bright boys detected the sinister . On the other hand , he , Reinhart , would as soon cut his throat as join the American Legion or a union or the Communists or the Republicans or the New Deal , or any other outfit the joining of which prohibited one the next day from being malignantly anti-Legion , antiunion , etc. , which alternation , irresponsible as it might be , to him signified , as nothing else , the precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest  --  in the trench ; towards Cronin and the doctor they had shown none to start with or end  --  and broke their ring , meandering into the rubbish towards the Chancellery terrace and the wall through which they had earlier issued , a series of high windows , shutters in all degrees of angle and caries , above each its own oeil-de-boeuf like the dot to an exclamation . " We can split up , if you want , " Reinhart cried before the dis/persal had gone absolute . " Everybody meet in one hour at the truck outside ! " Two persons made a noise of despair . " All right , forty-five minutes then . There 's lots more to see inside : you wo n't be bored for a moment . " Nevertheless he again heard the groans . " If little Harry Truman 's all that will stand in his way , expect Hitler back next month from Argentina , " said Cronin , " and back in the saddle . " " No , " the captain answered , not looking into the ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with majestynonetheless , the placebo-prescription majesty of the Americangeneral practitioner , famed source of the basic wisdom . " No , " he said , looking directly and honestly at Cronin , the punk kid yet with downy lip , probably still with Onan as his model , " no , he must never happen again . " From the exodus one figure lingered back , a first lieutenant who held his doffed cap and scratched a graying sideburn with the same hand . He studied something in the litter on which he stood and called , without raising his head : " Hey Bernstein ! " Cronin 's captain was named Bernstein . He joined his friend , who had found a Wehrmacht belt buckle in the sand , translated for him its inscription , Gott mit uns , and with him , two men whose race was half run , walked out of sight beyond the SS tower . Bernstein : his forebears , like so many Jews , forced by the census takers to assume cognomens , had gone to gems , precious metals , and flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient trees on the Baltic coast of Prussia , the sherrygoldenamber , for theirs , and , fortune 's dupes , brought it to America where its sound was more rasping than lovely on the air , if not downright comic , signifying bagels and upthrust hands . But it was another crime to be laid at the German door and not against the Jews , whose old desert tongue contained no word like " Bernstein "  --  or " Reinhart , " which in Reinhart 's sudden view wasp247scarcely better and only different from the doctor 's in that no one owed it apology  --  or " Schicklgruber-Hitler , " the funniest and ugliest of the lot . What could a man called Cronin say to Bernstein , Reinhart &; Schicklgruber , attorneys at law , delicatessen owners , or what have you , who fell out over the fratricide practiced by the lastnamed ? Germans , Hitler 's first victims were Germans ! , for that 's what German Jews were , no mistake ; else , observing no loyalty but to their own tribe everywhere alien , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the offensive , their noted acumen more than compensating for deficiency in numbers , and launched their own Hitler . But no , they had been too trusting , too naive , too German and not Jewish enough . Jews shrewd ? They were rather the rubes and boobs of history ; after two thousand years they were still fresh from the sticks , assumingbooblike that even in the city men were men and life was what you made it . Such innocence was almost wicked . Watching Bernstein 's shoulders too heavy to be moved by the effort of walking , Bernstein'stoo-solid flesh which , if some ambitious or perhaps merely desperate forebear had not shipped the Atlantic , would have by his fellow Germans been resolved into a dew , still hearing oxlike Bernstein 's simple , hateless statement that Hitler must not happenagain  --  Reinhart himself , pure Teuton , on the margin of this ditch would have condemned German , no , the world 's gentiles to eternal fire and thought it too cool  --  considering Bernstein the good , the innocent , the Jew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the chosen , the superior people . This had been Bach 's final meaning , only put in the queer , inside-out logic with which the truth was approached by Middle-Europeans , who really were sapient and deep and lived on an old ground ever fertilized by fresh gore . Poor cloistered Cronin , poor dear Veronica , they could not understand irony , that means to con/front the ideal with the actual and not go mad , that whip which produced the pain that hurts-so-good , so that in the measure to which it hurt it was also funny . Finally , having flogged and laughed yourself to the rim of death 's trench , you looked within and saw irony 's own irony : the last truth was the first . Poor Cronin 's hitherto mobile mouth fell open , static and silent at the incantatory syllables of " Bernstein . " He could be read like a highway poster : Can a Jew , vis-a-vis Hitler 's ghost , be wrong ? ' Far easier to accept that oneself is an ass . When he closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned to the ivy he would switch his major to natural science . " Politics , " said Very , pressing her bosom like an armload of soccer balls against Reinhart 's arm  --  accidentally ? : to study that was Reinhart 's own relief  --  " thank God that 's an Irish trait I do n't have ! Find a politician , find a crook , as the man says . " Poutingly she flung away from his side , as if he were sure to hold the opposing view , swinging tapelike her soft fall of hair which , seining the sun , caught a sudden amber shaming old Prussia with its clarity and fire . In the combination of Very and Trudchen , Reinhart 's needs were met . Such a thing was thereby proved possible , contrary to the popular wisdom which crepe-hangingly warned that man , the questing beast , was never satisfied , that worse than not achieving your aim was getting it . Indeed , he was living high off the hog in Berlin . He was rich : Marsala had sold all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the candy ration . He did even less work than before : now that the tour was set it ran itself and Pound was gone off on leave to Switzerland , of course in the company of Nurse Lightner , where he intended to buy and transport to Berlin as personal luggage a footlocker full of wristwatches . Organize your sex life and all else followed , the phallus being the key to the general metropolis of manhood , which most ofp249the grand old civilizations knew but we in America had forgotten . For example , in Ohio carnal knowledge of a sixteen-yearoldgirl was a prelude to the penitentiary ; they could stick their pointed tits like crayon-ends in your face , wag their sloping little behinds , in summer wear shorts to the junction of belly and thigh , but if you rolled an eyeball towards them you were a pervert . He never entered Trudchen without tremors of retroactiverevenge . With Very , on the other hand , he was getting back at Germanyand all its exoticism gone nasty . That was the great thing about women : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had begun to think of himself as the kind of fellow who might one day get married ; at least he detected the future inclination . Writingto Pound 's wife he had felt vicariously that peculiar pleasure of having an attachment one owed to and was owed by . Love as a mutual debt  --  certainly it was new to him as he grew old . No longer did he spring from bed at Marsala 's eight-o'clock clarion , but lingered for a second and a third and then the thrust of a hard hand against his head , at which , still unconscious  --  which was his excuse  --  he punched out wildly at his disturber , and even though he usually missed , Marsala stayed sullen all day at these thanks . A mature man should not live with another , but with a woman from whose soft lump beside him under the steaming , odorous blankets he can take a motive to rise , the sooner to be off to honest work , the sooner to be home again as evening falls to meet this sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prepared for two and not five hundred . Yet what honest work ? Had the war not come he would now have been for a year and a quarter a Bachelor of  --  what ? A process beginning in Central Europe in 1933 ( Carlo had a popgun , wanted an air rifle ) , or 1924 , then : Hitler , having failed to capture Bavaria with his private army of cranks and loafers , sits in the prison of Landsberg am Lech dictating to Hess a lunatic statement of aims which two decades later when they have
