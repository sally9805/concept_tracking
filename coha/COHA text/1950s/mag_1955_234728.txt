For stay-at-homes on New Year 's Eve , television produced some fine coverage of the Times Square area , jammed with half a million revelers but marred , on NBC , by Ben Grauer 's excessive commercials right up until the last minute of the old year . On Tonight , Steve Allen kept things consistently festive , and amused his viewers with an apt description of the holiday ( " New Year 's Eve is the night the A.A.A. and A.A. get together " ) and with his straight-faced predictions for 1955 . Some of the predictions : Marilyn Monroe calendars will bring back 1954 ; Arthur Godfrey will fire his entire audience ; Betty Furness will marry an iceman . <P> The week 's dramatic shows filled the air with fleeing Communists . On Danger , three Soviet airmen in a bomber escaped over the North Pole to find sanctuary near Boston ; on NBC 's Kraft TV Theater , two refugee Polish ballet dancers came to earth in New Hampshire ; on CBS 's Climax , a Russian scientist , carrying a horrifying canister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom before his plane crashed somewhere near Copenhagen . U.S. military and U.S. intelligence agents came off superbly in all these brisk encounters with the enemy , but the plays themselves were not very good . <P> ABC 's Kraft TV Theater offered the week 's best dramatic fun by dusting off an old Italian chestnut , Alberto Casella 's Death Takes a Holiday , which was first seen on Broadway in 1929 . Actor Joseph Wiseman played the Grim Reaper taking a three-day fling at mortal follies , and was ably seconded by Stiano Braggiotti as the tortured duke and Lelia Barry as the girl who falls in love with Death . On NBC 's Lux Video Theater , veteran Pat O'Brien had an actor 's field day in The Chase . <P> <P> Instead of portraying his usual role of the kindly parish priest , O'Brien zestfully acted the part of a blustering bully who alternately slapped Ruth Roman and groveled at her feet .
