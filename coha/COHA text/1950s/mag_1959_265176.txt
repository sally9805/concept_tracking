THE HOUSING FIGHT <P> EVERYONE in Washington agrees that the U.S. should have a new Government housing program . But how much should the U.S. spend ? And on what ? <P> The Administration wants to spend $317.6 million in fiscal 1960 , down sharply from last year 's emergency expenditure of $1.1 billion . The Senate has upped the ante : it passed a bill raising expenditures to $505 million for 1960 , obligating $3.6 billion in future years . House bills go even farther : they call for increasing expenditures to $957.5 million next year , obligating a total of $6.1 billion . <P> No one , least of all President Eisenhower , maintains that the Administration 's program does all that is needed in U.S. housing . But many economists and housing experts agree that it is all the U.S. can afford at this time , considering the goals of a balanced budget and heavy commitments for national defense . Moreover , it is all the prosperous housing industry really needs to keep booming along at its present fast pace . <P> Last March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts were down to a rate of 918,000 annually . But now housing is steaming ahead at the rate of 1,350,000 starts annually with forecasts of a record $52.3 billion ( up from $49 billion ) in total construction for the year without any increase in Government spending . <P> The major differences between the Eisenhower Administration and the heavily Democratic Congress is on veterans ' housing , urban renewal and public housing . The Senate wants to spend an additional $150 million on direct loans to veterans ; the House bill calls for $300 million . The Administration flatly opposes both , argues that a better way to help the VA program is to boost the indirect rate ceiling on VA loans , currently pegged by law at 4% , which is too low to get veterans mortgage money , to 5% , where financing is more readily available . Congress has agreed to the boost but as part of packages that include the millions for direct loans . <P> On urban renewal , the Administration hopes to hold the line at $1.45 billion spread through fiscal 1965 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House wants $1.5 billion through fiscal 1961 alone . The nation 's planners agree that big-city slums should be eliminated as fast as possible , but so far the Federal Government has footed two-thirds of the cost . The Administration wants to cut its share to 50% by 1963 . It thus intends to prod the states , which have done little spending so far for urban renewal . The Administration figures the states should then come in with more funds . <P> The Administration 's strongest case is against additional billions for public housing . Though the Senate wants 45,000 more units by 1963 , and the House proposes 190,000 more units without a time limit , builders and city planners agree that the U.S. already has more public housing authorized than it can digest . Money has been appropriated for 110,000 units on which work has not even started . In Philadelphia , for example , 10,000 units have been authorized over the last few years , and 5.000 of them are not yet under construction . Cities are having trouble with rising costs and finding suitable " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Taft : " You can not move people that fast . "
