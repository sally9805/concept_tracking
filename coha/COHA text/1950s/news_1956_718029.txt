txt Teen - age drinking has emerged as a prime , short-range problem of the Connecticut-New York , New Jersey metropolitan area needing immediate and effective action . The proniem was so aesignoted by elected officials from New Jersey and Connecticut cities and counties who on June 18 , attended the first conference on metropolitan area problems held in the " committee of the whole " room in the redecorated City Hall under Mayor Robert F. Wagner 's leadership . The disasters on and off the highways which result from the serving of intoxicating liquors to young people have long been recognized as a situation which needs remedying . In the metropolitan area , however , this basic evil is complicated by a difference in state laws which govern the serving of liquor to teen-agers . New York has established an 18-year legal age , while in New Jersey and Connecticut the legal age is 21 years . A glance at the map shows that the lower end of New York State penetrates in an area closely knit together ' and surrounded by the heavily populated cities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and police officials of these states told the conference that young people ( 18-21 ) from the areas over which they have control , sneak over to New York State for liquor and come back home to make law enforcement problems more difficult and to add to the accident toll on the highways . Such spokesmen wanted the conference to exert its full influence on the New York State Legislature , where bills for raising the age limit to 21 years have failed of passage . Mayor Nicholas S. La Corte of Elizabeth , N. J. ( only a short distance from New York 's Staten Island ) , was the first one to name teen-age drinking as a conference issue . Mayor Wagner had already presented some metropolitan problems and the need for such conferences in a penetrating and thoughtful speech . He defined the area as embracing 550 communities in 770 square miles with ? total population of 15.5 million . " expected to reach 19 million " by 1976 . Traffic , transportation , water , Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . air pollution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should consider as a whole . But the keynote of Mayor Wagner 's address was a plea for cooperative action . This was agreed to by such other elected officials as the Mayor of Elizabeth . But Mayor La Corte did not want the conference committee ( a six-man steering committee was formed ) to become tagged as a " do-nothing " organization because of the long-range nature of its objectives . Mayor La Corte says he would have the conference face up to a " problem that can be resolved immediately . " This , he explained , was the teen-age drinking problem in Union County . " All sorts of crimes are happening " because of it . Committee action to bring about a uniform 21-year legal age for the serving of liquor , backed up by public opinion " despite the objections of liquor interests " was urged . More Conferences Due " One of the biggest problems that this conference can tackle is to begin a campaign in the New York State Legislature to raise the drinking age limit and create a uniform standard in our area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County officiaL " As we see it there is no question that to a great degree the failure of New York State to act is a contributing factor to delinquency in New Jersey and Connecticut . " The way the issue of teen-age drinking popped up and the spontaneous nature of the remarks which followed its introduction marked the conference as one which took very literally Mayor Wagner 's invitation to " present some ideas " and to " keep it as informal as possible . " Tirre will be further such conferences . One to be held in the fall will benefit by the operations of a six-man steering committee with Mayor Wagner as chairman , and these members : Karl Metzger , director of the Board of Freeholders of Middlesex County , N.J. ; James D. Hopkins , Westchester County executive ; A. Holly Patterson , Nassau County executive ; Mayor Thomas F. J. Quigley of Stamford , Conn. ; and Mayor Bernard J. Berry of Jersey City , N.J.                    @
