Everybody Laughs at Me One sticky evening last summer in New York , I was in front of a television camera on behalf of Old Spice for sixty minutes . When a television camera is turned on , it has one beady red eye that is not affected by the weather . The temperature that night was ninety-six , but the sponsor was a much younger man . After the show the CBS man handed me a check for $175,000 and said it was the largest fee ever paid one entertainer for an hour 's work . I kept the check . For a few minutes , anyway . Then I sent it on to the Government . I do n't know exactly what I did to earn $175,000 . It seems like a lot of money , but I like to think of it as the interest on forty-three years of hard work and fighting . The original script is on my desk , and on the first page it says : " Dissolve to black ... dissolve to wide-angle shot ... dissolve to Borge . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After eighteen pages of nothing  --  I am an ad-lib man , you seethe script ends with : " Lights dim as we dissolve . . . then dissolve to film . . . cross dissolve to commercial . Borge exits . " This is what gives me insomnia when I think of television . Some night they will dissolve me before I can get to the exit . I shall be so completely dissolved that people will call me Instant Borge . I am so sensitive to the power of that little camera eye that it even bothers me while I 'm driving my car . When the traffic lights turn red I automatically start not playing the piano . That makes me look pretty silly to other motorists because I do n't have a piano in my car . Most of the television performers I know share my apprehension about the lethal effect of that heady red eye . Steve Allen once said to rue ? Well , I do n't remember what he said , but it was crucial . I have gone into this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessions . You can not know whether a man beats his wife or smokes opium unless he tells you . It has been said that Borge is the man nobody knows , despite the fact that relays of press agents shadow me night and day , tap my phone , read THE SATURDAY PI C. " my mail and cross-examine my wife for these titbits of information . They have told the public , naturally , that I can order is meal in five languages , but that waiters keep bringing me hamburgers anyway . There have been news bulletins which read : " Burge Grosses 52,500.1300 , Breaks Record With One-Man Show on Broadway . " There have been items about my Rock Cornish hens , which do n't lay eggs , and about my jokes , which sometimes do . There have even been newspaper arguments on the question : Is he a pianist-comedian or a comedian-pianist or neither ? But my audiences still have n't the slightest idea whether I walk in my sleep or wear suspenders . I do n't intend to tell everything . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so 1 am going to confess a few little things before I get into my story . The experts assure me that hereafter people will feel kindly toward my frailties and even think of me as a member of the family . Sponsors have a warm feeling for families because families buy more products than anybody . I am writing this in what guests refer to as the smoking room of my home in Southbury , Connecticut . Of course , every Mom in this old colonial house is a smoking room . There are seven fireplaces , SO you 'll know why . 1 am what people generally call a chain smoker . Actually , I only smoke cigarettes . I have cigarette boxes all over the house , but they arc full of clippings , buttons , pins or bits of yarn . I have numerous fully automatic cigarette lighters , but not one of them ever works , I do n't know whether cigarettes are good or bad for my health . It so happens that I am a good insurance risk , but l have had cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a guest star on a big-budget television show sponsored by a certain tobacco company , and they were paying rge a substantial amount for ten minutes of my time. , Midway through the show the announcer began his inspired commercial and handed me a cigarette . " Here , Victor , " he said pleasantly , " wo n't you have one of our smooth , mellow and tender smokes ? " " No , thanks , " I said . The announcer paled and abandoned the script . " What ? " he snapped . " Why not ? " " Because my doctor told me to quit , " I said , coughing loudly , was only telling the truth . I really had quit , temporarily . I was never again invited to perform on that show , even though 1 would go on stage now and smoke like dry ice on a hot day . have another failing which might be considered a health hazard . I like to buy clothes for my wife , Sanna . Buying does not mean just the act of signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never see the bills and my wife signs the checks . " You-all are too busy , " she says in her quaint Kentucky way , " to be bothered with such liT or details. - But I like to go into smart shops and pick out dresses or evening gowns , just as though I knew what I was doing . I have been warned by old hands that I ern courting domestic disaster , but Sanna tells me I have good taste . I remember going into one Fifth Avenue store a Christmas or two ago . There was a chic and lovely woman sitting beside me as the models paraded frilly things . Every time she nodded , I said , " I 'll take it . " Her head kept bobbing all afternoon , and I spent a small fortune before I realized she 'd been taking a nap . But asleep or awake , she knew what was good . Her name , by the way , was Marlene Dietrich . One of the gowns we chose that day had a long , regal-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a dinner party given by William Randolph Hearst , Jr ? for Henri Bonnet , the outgoing French ambassador to the United States , We were barely seated at this gay affair when Mr. Hearst proposed a toast to Monsieur Bonnet , and all the guests stood up . Everyone but Sanna , that is . I was extremely embarrassed and I thought , Holy smoke . They 'll probably think she 's a C01771171MiSi and there 'll be international consequences . Fortunately , it was a short toast , and after we sat down , I whispered to Sanna , " For heaven 's sake , why did n't you stand up ? " " I could n't , " she whispered back , " Somebody was standing on my train and I was nailed to the floor . " The " somebody " on that short train ride happened to be the Duke of Windsor . Well , I guess they did n't stand on trains in Owensboro , Kentucky , where Sanna was once a town belle , because they had plenty of seats . The incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . When I was playing the Golden Theater in New York , some of the great stars of the stage and screen paid me the compliment of coming backstage for a personal word . There were always a lot of strangers , too , many of them wanting autographs , and Sanna tried to handle things in an orderly fashion . She stood guard at the dressing-room door and was such a formidable sentry , as I said earlier , that some called her " The Dragon . " One night the visitors included Luise Rainer , who won an Academy Award for her role in The Good Earth , and she trudged up the stairs toward Sanna . " Hello , " she said , " I 'm Luise Rainer , and I just thought I 'd say hello to Victor . " There was quite a crowd that night , and Sanna gave her the cool , appraising gaze . " Of course , " she said mechanically . " Mr. Borge will be glad to autograph your program if you 'll just get in tine right over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've had a lot of chuckles about it ever since , During the twenty-seven months I was on Broadway I tried to spend weekends at home with my family , Like many busy people , I work late at night , mostly on tax deductions and similar hobbies , and SO commuter trains to Connecticut were out of the question , Consequently I traveled the 170-mile round trip by car , and this brings up another weakness of mine . I love to drive a good car , especially on long , smooth parkways . The combination is almost irresistible , and those long stretches  --  as any motorist knows  --  invite you to go faster than you should . I have never caused an accident myself , although other drivers have twice twisted me up like a pretzel . The first time was in Copenhagen , when another motorist sneaked out of an intersection and draped his engine over my windshield . I am furious if I have to miss a theater date  --  it has happened only once or twice in my life  --  and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other crash occurred at an intersection in Victorville , California , and put me in the hospital for a month . The aforementioned broken bones were not nearly as embarrassing , though , as a mishap I had one afternoon in Connecticut . Just an hour or so earlier I had had lunch with Gov . Abraham Ribicoff at Hartford , and among other things I complimented him on his campaign to cut down traffic accidents on Connecticut highways . Governor Ribicoff was also planning a tourist-and-travel program , and at his request I agreed to help both drives in any way he suggested . I was thinking about these campaigns while I was driving back home , and the more I thought the faster I went . Presently the peaceful air was pierced by a siren , that ominous whining which chills the s tokdhhhvt 1 sberseea eoranoi : tarf an . hearts cyst dal longer 1 h. year poi soreaa Also , scncs , appointment al oolnmotorists gandool of advertisin m o t o r i s t s , and I pulled up on the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how it is . You sit there with your stomach down by your shoe tops and you fumble for some reasonable excuse : My mother-In-law beat up a symphony conductor and I 'm rushing to her bedside . The governor is a pal of mine , see ? I just had lunch with him and I 'm doing some traffic research . And so on . " Borge , eh ? " the officer said , glancing at my driver 's license . " I s'pose the gov-emor 's a friend of yours ? " " Why , no , " I said . " I hardly know him . " " Who 's the guy sitting with you ? " T glanced to my right at Bill Heath , the family driver . He was sitting there in his uniform , suppressing a smile . " Him ? Oh , he 's my chauffeur , " I said . " Then why is n't he at the wheel ? " " Because he 's such a lousy driver , " I said .

Since then  --  if you happen to be reading this , governor  --  I 've switched my allegiance to another governor . The one the me-chanic installed in my car , Also , I 've made it easy to slow down with a system I herewith offer free to any driver who raoasnt dmalmostr. r so a o s Later , w orni tnmi g t buy y a u s e dl b ie'n. -1 . i tepcvrcoursetnhskrel aiblyenahl nrrewesstabuu ti eewcs i leevoosbesol ueneefaacui tneed lot - nai tn , tutsflt nsgt t at l hoi otboey. , 1 noemdnyrardsmytminute flying oei evt  --  asi I watch anl t l unc It i hety s and ahead , e id withe 1 ak the d , a my own rash purchases .

Someone accused me of buying the little lire engine so I could use the siren and thus get accustomed to the sound , but that is n't true . It so happens that we use it for pumping irrigation water . But I also like fire engines , and furthermore , I might need this one if I keep on burning up the music critics . I had a mental list of the shortcomings to which I was going to confess , but I 've mislaid it somewhere . I am always forgetting the little things . 1 ca n't read a magazine on a train if anyone is sitting near me , and I ca n't read on an airplane unless we are flying through clouds . When I do try to concentrate I am apt to go into a trance . Many years ago in Copenhagen , when I came offstage during the intermission at a recital , my father anxiously took me aside . " Are you ill ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I feel fine . " " Well ? " he said , peering at me gravely . " You got to a passage in that Beethoven sonata and played it eight times . " Obviously I had blacked out , but my fingers kept moving in the same rotation , like a stuck needle on a phonograph . I have fallen asleep at the keyboard a number of times , but my hands seem to function without missing a note . Sometimes my audiences fall asleep , too , and then I have to get new material . There does not seem to be any medical explanation for my own dreamlike lapses , but I 'm sure it 's nothing to worry about . It is probably a form of self-hypnosis brought on by my deep immersion in the warm flow of music . Certain Compositions I play  --  for instance , Chopin'shave a very soothing effect when the lights are dimmed during a performance , and I find myself drifting off . One of these blackouts , caused by a wave of intense fear , almost ruined my American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait . I suffer from claustrophobia , too , but I 've learned to avoid situations that might trigger this mechanism . Remember that popular song Do n't Fence Me In ? I think it was written for me . I ca n't sleep in a narrow bed , for instance , because when dawn breaks I am apt to be missing . Sauna might find me on the window sill or at the supermarket . Back in the war years , when I was living on a ranch in Chatsworth , near Hollywood , something went wrong with the plumbing under the house . There was no basement , and there were n't any plumbers , and so I crawled under the house to fix it myself . I was lying there on the ground in darkness , staring at the subflooring a foot or so above my face , and suddenly I was frozen with fright . Suppose I got stuck there and could n't get out ? No one would ever find me . I do n't know whether I yelled for help . I do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , that pipe is still leaking . I can ride a small plane through hail and lightning , but since that Chatsworth experience I ca n't go into a tunnel or a small closet or under a car without the sickening feeling that I am trapped . If any of my friends twit me about this problem  --  and they had better not  --  I can always say that at least claustrophobia introduced me to the lovely lass with the name few can pronounce or spell properly  --  Zsa Zsa Gabor . I had been living in a small New York hotel room in 1950 , and when the walls began to close in I started looking for an apartment . Zsa Zsa  --  pronounced Shah Shah  --  had been divorced for some time from Conrad Hilton , the hotel magnate , and was moving to California with her new husband , George Sanders , the English actor . Someone told me she was planning to lease her brownstone house on 73rd Street and I rushed right over , Maybe I should have walked . She let me have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , But I was happy to have it , for it did n't have any tiny closets and the beds were full size . A couple of months later Zsa Zsa wrote to me from Los Angeles : Dear Victor : I hope you . are enjoying my house . I have not heard a peep out of you since you moved in . Maybe that means you have burned down all my furnishings already . I do enjoy you greatly on TV , and would like to have a short note from you whether you are a good boy with my house . In the meantime I am also on television out here now , and have lots of fun at it . Good-by , and a sisterly kiss . ZSA ZSA I wrote right back , and in a brotherly way thanked her for the sisterly kiss and assured her the furniture was intact and that I was a good boy . I did have something I could have peeped about , and perhaps Zsa Zsa wo n't mind if I tell the story now . I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performing at the Waldorf then  --  when Conrad Hilton dropped in for an informal chat . We had a drink or two in the first-floor salon , and later went to the living room on the second floor . We were talking about show business and the state of the box office when Conrad put down his glass and looked around the room with a puzzled expression . " You have a charming house here , Victor , " he said . " But I ca n't shake the feeling that I 've been here before . " " That 's possible , " I said . " It certainly looks familiar , " he said , scratching his head . " Oh , well , the mind plays tricks sometimes . " Half an hour later we went down the curving stairs to the entrance hall , and Conrad picked up his hat and reached for the door knob . He stood there a moment , seemingly lest in thought , Suddenly he slapped his well-tailored coat , and burst out laughing . " Ye gods , Victor ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I bought this house for Zsa Zsa . " Zsa Zsa , incidentally , never came to the house while I was living there , but this effervescent girl has a subtle way of invading your subconscious and staying there . Indeed , I can blame her for one of the most undiplomatic ad-libs that ever popped out of my head . I was invited to a sumptuous affair given by a New York publisher for the Shah of Iran and his beautiful QUeen . When I got to the flower-laden suite at the Pierre Hotel , there was a line of celebrities moving toward the regal couple . As the guests were formally introduced , they bowed and delivered a gracious word or two , and I was still fumbling for the right phrase when I reached the Shah . He greeted me democratically , smiled and shook my hand . Suddenly the pixies took over my tongue . " 1 have the pleasure of knowing your charming sister , " I said . His black eyebrows went up . " You do ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " For one instant the Shah 's face clouded like a tornado sky . Then he let go with a booming royal laugh , and I moved on . He must have known her too , There are times and places , I think , when a performer 's clowning instincts simply get beyond control , but a good deal of this original material is lost in these off-stage sallies . I remember going to the Stork Club with Sanna one evening , and being introduced for the first time to Sonja Henie , the skating beauty . As we sat down at our own table , Sanna said , sotto voce , " My , she certainly looks young . " " Why not ? " I said . " She 's been on ice all her life . " A couple of bystanders urged me to use the line in my show , but I never did , Quips like this are reserved for the immediate family . Since this chapter is a sort of Inside Borge , I would like to say that I have never intentionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't use what the trade calls blue material . I think Bach , Beethoven and Brahms , plus Dick Wagner , as we call him here , are adequate targets , along with an occasional music critic and some of the frosty crones who run symphony orchestras . For years I have been looked upon as a villain destroying the dignity of classical music hPrause 1 burlesque an opera or some other classical work . To my mind these criticisms need no defense because no one loves music more than I. If I can open up a new horizon of the beauty in music for one man , woman or child , by whatever means . I am grateful . Music should be loved for its own sake , not because it is fashionable , cultural or a social obligation . As for me , the so-called wrecker of the immortals , my most loyal followers are the artists who have spent their lives in music and who wish that people would n't fall asleep while they 're supposed to be absorbing a spiritual offering . One of my most cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Mary in mid-Atlantic after I had performed for the British Broadcasting Corporation in London last summer : SORRY HAVING MISSED YOU IN TRANSIT . YOUR MIRACULOUS PERFORMANCE STILL SUPERSEDES SUEZ CRISIS . HOPE SEE YOU HERE SOON AGAIN . PERSONAL GREETINGS . It was signed by one of the world 's great pianists  --  Benno Moiseiwitsch . Yes , I have my personal and pet peeves , like anyone else . I am vexed by people who complain if I do not spend the entire evening playing the piano . 1 do not pretend to give piano recitals , but if that day ever comes , I will go into any old concert hall and devote the whole program to the classics . I will bet you that some people will walk out demanding a refund because they did n't get a laugh . I am also nettled by people who protest if I do n't answer their letters at once . The trouble is , I get hundreds of letters every week , and since 1 am a one-man show and not Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , I have no fan-mail department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests for endorsements , pictures , money , World Series tickets or the recipe for my own personal barbecue sauce , But I do the best I can . Every day I deal with agents , bookers , TV and movie producers , musicians , advertising men and newspaper reporters , poultry farmers and distributors , veterinarians , builders , carpenters , electricians , salesmen and mechanics , as well as my wife and live children . I do this on tour and even on vacations . I have n't had a vacation for seven years . In my spare time I practice new selections and try out new material for my shows . Now you can see why it takes me awhile to catch up . Since fan letters are the priceless mirrors of my work , 1 insist on personally answering those that require a responses I have my own code system for marking letters and notes . An " x , " for instance , means a must answer . An " xx " means it is urgent . When I have answered a note , Put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I put a rope around my neck . If it 's a matter of any interest , I am also addicted to hunches , and they are generally right because I am a very lucky man . Some years ago , when I was playing a night club in Covington , Kentucky , I had a hunch to wander into the back room and see what the boys were having . There was a crap table , and a woman was busily throwing dice . She was a little under the weather  --  to me this is a good sign  --  so put a few dollars on No . I I at i 5 to I. The inspired lady shooter beat astronorrucal odds and rolled six consecutive elevens . I made about 12100 by doubling my bets , and the management was so happy they begged me to stay on another week The casinos want me in Las Vegas , too , but I have a hunch that the woman under the weather wo n't be there at the same time . I have almost overlooked some other minor delinquencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is a standing order to leave it that way . I stuff things into bottom drawers and find them years later . Just now I 've dug out a note from Jinx Falkenburg McCrary which says : " Dear Victor : As usual you were terrific . So terrific , in fact , that the David Sarnoffs were falling on the floor with laughter . " There 's no date on the letter , I do n't recall answering it , and I have n't the vaguest idea what was so terrific . Except that they perhaps were so happy because I might have appeared on another network . I have a number of scrapbooks that are dog-eared and yellowed . Long years ago , before I learned English , I started saving clippings , comic strips and similar things , so I could study them and pick up the American idiom . I can just barely decipher one of these weathered cartoon jokes about two matrons . The first woman says : " You mean you left your husband because he had flat feet ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet were always in some other woman 's flat . " You can see what I went through to learn English . In my attic are packing cases full of reprints . I anl a glutton for reprints . When a critic said something nice , I bought hundreds of reprints of the review . But no one ever told me what to do with this stuff , and now it 's a fire hazard in my house . I hale to throw out all that paper because it might come in handy someday . I hear they 're already paying a dollar a ton . I love road maps , too , and I never throw them away . I have road maps for all the forty-eight states , the Pentagon and Grand Central Station . Unfortunately , a road map is something you 've swept out of your car trunk the day before you need it . In a Copenhagen hotel room I once found a Colorado road map abandoned by an American tourist , I was as excited as Columbus when he discovered Queen Isabella . All those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it did n't help much in Denmark . The country is so small that when you go through a stop light too fast you 're in Sweden . I went wrong only once with a road map . I had assembled an orchestra in 1945 , and started out for a concert tour of Midwestern and Southern states . One night en route to Roanoke , Virginia , we came to a crossroads and turned right . An hour or so later we came to an intersection that looked very familiar . " Hey ! " I said to the bus driver . " We 've made this turn once tonight , and here we are again , " The driver glared and said , " Maestro , you stick to your piano and I 'll handle the wheel . I could drive this route blindfolded . " Apparently he did . Two hours later , when we groaned through that intersection for the third time , I showed the driver my own road map . " Look , you turn left , not right , " said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped to ask for directions . That was when we discovered that my map was right and the driver was wrong . It was the first time in years that I got to a theater late , but it was n't really our fault , It was Halloween , and the neighborhood kids had reversed all the signs . Still with me ? Fine . There will now be a short intermission of approximately seven days . See you then !
