The fact that 85% of the boy babies born in U.S. private hospitals nowadays are circumcised , regardless of the parents ' religious beliefs , may be an important factor in reducing cancer of the uterine cervix ( neck of the womb ) in years to come . Dr. Ernest L. Wynder. of Manhattan 's Memorial Center for Cancer and Allied Diseases , * has reached this comforting conclusion after studying the striking differences in the incidence of cervical cancer among women with different marital histories . <P> It all began with the oft-quoted observation that among Jewish women whose husbands have been routinely , ritually circumcised , cervical cancer is only one-tenth to one-fifth as common as among non-Jewish women of similar age and social status . Was this coincidence or what ? <P> To find out , Dr. Wynder arranged exhaustive interviews of 1,900 women in twelve U.S. hospitals scattered over four states ; one-third of them had cervical cancer , while the rest ( the controls ) had other diseases of the pelvis . <P> The answers ruled out the possibility of coincidence . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , miscarriages and douches as possible causes of this type of cancer ( which , in frequency , is second only to breast cancer among U.S. women , and takes an estimated 14,000 lives a year , despite thousands of operations for removal ) . Dr. Wynder 's key findings : <P> A woman whose husband is uncircumcised runs 2 times as great a risk of cervical cancer as a woman , married only once , whose husband has been circumcised . <P> A woman married only once , but beginning intercourse at 16 , is twice as likely to develop cervical cancer as a woman married between 20 and 24 . The likelihood keeps going down as the marriage age goes up . <P> A woman who has two or more marital partners runs a proportionately greater risk of cervical cancer than those married once . <P> That marriage and sexual relations are not the only elements in cervical cancer was shown by the fact that 1% of the victims had never had intercourse . To test his U.S. findings , Dr. Wynder enlisted the help of physicians in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the wives of uncircumcised Hindus than among those of circumcised Moslems , though their hygienic standards are about the same . <P> Among men , penile cancer is far rarer than cervical cancer among women , but its occurrence follows the same pattern . Dr. Wynder 's deduction : circumcision may be a big help in preventing both , presumably because it facilitates personal cleanliness . <P> <P> * Formerly of St. Louis ' Washington University , where , with famed Surgeon Evarts Graham , he produced cancers on the backs of mice with tobacco tar ( TIME , Nov. 30 ) .
