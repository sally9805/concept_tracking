London was staging a show of Hogarths last week that would have pleased the old 18th Century painter-engraver pink . Instead of featuring the satiric , story-telling picture series ( Harlot 's Progress , Rake 's Progress , Marriage a la Mode , etc. ) which made him famous in his lifetime , the show was crammed with the portraits of prominent folk and the sprawling historical canvases which Hogarth himself considered his finest and most important work . <P> The cross William Hogarth had to bear was that he simply did not impress his contemporaries as a serious painter . His colors were too fresh , his draftsmanship too free &; easy , his characterizations too blunt and unflattering . When he held auctions of his oils in 1745 and 1751 , the paintings he liked best were laughed at . Even the oil originals of some of his most popular engravings sold for little more than the price of their frames . Finally , in disgust and despair , he took down the shingle of his trade from his London house and retired to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide whether I was the best or the worst face painter of my day . " <P> Last week 's show supported a conclusion that time and later critics reached long ago : besides being one of the most biting social satirists and moralists who ever etched an engraving , Hogarth at his best could paint circles around most of his contemporaries . His portrait of Captain Thomas Coram , philanthropist-founder of London 's Foundling Hospital , displays a British humor and humanity that Hogarth 's two famous 18th Century successors , Gainsborough and Reynolds , too often sacrificed for a slick and fawning elegance . His March of the Guards Towards Scotland , an action-filled canvas of the departure of George II 's soldiers to put down Bonnie Prince Charlie 's Highlands uprising of 1745 , is ironic Hogarth realism at its sharpest . Hogarth 's most famous oil , The Shrimp Girl , is missing from the show , but a gently smiling Mrs. Salter and the portrait of Hogarth 's niece , Mary Lewis , have much of the same spontaneous , light-brushed charm . In his self-portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made a gentle joke at his own expense , played up the resemblance between man and dog . <P> It was the first big Hogarth exhibition in London in more than 100 years . Nobody in Britain seemed able to explain the long oversight for sure . Roland Beckett , art historian and Hogarth expert , suspected it was the old trouble : " People think of him as a mere cartoonist. "
