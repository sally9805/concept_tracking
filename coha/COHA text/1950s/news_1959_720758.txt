txt BONN , Germany , Oct. 2 Dean Acheson , former Secretary of State , leveled stinging criticism today at President Eisenhower 's attempt to reach , an accommodation with the Soviet Union on Berlin . It is playing the Soviet game to agree even to discuss the Berlin situation , Mr. Acheson said at a news conference . He declared that any change in the ' existing regime would be " a very bad idea . " The former Secretary of State is here to attend an unofficial conference of prominent Germans and Americans on East-West tensions as they affect their two countries . View Is Summed Up Mr. Acheson summed up his view of the Berlin situation in these words : " All the trouble in Berlin is caused by Mr. Khrushchev . The situation there could endure for the indefinite future . But he decided to upset the arrangement a year ago . " I would tell Mr. Khrushchev that I would not discuss Berlin . Let 's talk about other matters , but there is nothing to talk about there * * * . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite adequate  --  leave it alone . " Premier Khrushchev proposed last November that West Berlin be made a free city , suggesting that the United Nations might have a role in its government . Later the Soviet Union pro- ' posed that the Western garri-1 sons in West Berlin be replaced ' by " neutral forces " under the United Nations . Threat Held Removed After Mr. Khrushchev 's talks with President Eisenhower , last week-end , the President said Mr. Khrushchev had removed any , threat to a negotiated settlement of the l3erlin problem . In Mr. Acheson 's view , the Soviet Union raised the Berlin crisis to feel out the strength of the North Atlantic alliance . " There is a certain relaxation now , " he said . " I believe this period is of a definite duration . When the time is up , we had better be strong enough . " The Democratic party 's foreign policy expert said that the // NATO alliance , whose military achievements since 1952 were " notable for the lack of any , " should build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time left , " he said . Mr. Acheson 's advocacy of a " hard line " was put forward on receptive ground . President lEisenhower 's expressed willingness to bring an open mind to future negotiations on the Berlin issue has ? stirred a sense of uneasiness here that has not abated despite repeated reassurances conveyed from Washington . The West German Government announced today that Chancellor Konrad Adenauer had received the latest of these , a personal letter from the President , and was " very satisfied . " The contents of the letter were not disclosed . An appraisal of the Western military position was the central topic in today 's discussion , among the fifty delegates to the privately organized GermanAmerican conference . Leading political and academic personalities of the two countries are taking part in the four-day symposium , Kissinger Is Speaker Dr. Henry A. Kissinger of Harvard University and Adalbert Weinstein , Frankfurt military commentator , spoke at the outset of the day 's discussion . Dr. Kissinger held forth the thesis that the Western world 's ability to deter Communist ago'ression was overbalanced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all means of defense and the military potential of NATO 'S European members in particular . Herr Weinstein , who served on the German General Staff in World War II , likewise called for a new buildup of Allied military power in West Germany . He startled the conference by asserting that military , logic called for the equipment ' of the West German armed forces with strategic nuclear weapons . The West Germans lack the will to defend themselves under , present circumstances , he said . To enhance the country 's de-fensive capabilities , more United States forces should be ' stationed in Germany and something on the order of the Wehrmacht 's wartime " West Wall " should be erected along the East German border to give the NATO command a continuous front , according to Herr Weinstein . Weinstein Ideas Rejected The ensuing closed discussion was notable , according to persons present , for the unanimity with which Herr Weinstein 's ideas were rejected . West German Social Democratic delegates joined supporters of Chancellor Adenauer in asserting that citizens of the Bonn republic were ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acheson , Dr. James B. Conant , former United States Ambassador here , and Governor Robert B. Meyner of New Jersey , all members of the United States group , told reporters , that they agreed that the offering of strategic nuclear arms to West Germany was " most undesirable . " The sense of the conference , according to participants , was that a general strengthening of NATO military potential was necessary to meet the continuing Soviet threat . In a second panel group , discussing economic and social issues , Irving Engel , former president of the American Jewish Committee , suggested that a " permanent arrangement " be made for cultural , intellectual and artistic cooperation among NATO members , He urged the West Germans to take the lead in demonstrating " the great potentialities of a society based on equality of rights and the elimination of the evils of prejudice and bigotry . " In Germany . he said , the real test of the viability of a social system based on freedom and respect for human dignity would be made .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
