At 7:30 one morning last week , King Farouk 's past caught up with him . He looked out of the huge window of his office in the summer palace in Alexandria , saw tanks and cannons of a hostile army - his own-advancing under cover of Egyptian Royal Air Force planes . Farouk had made and unmade Premiers and generals , manipulated the Arab League , and lost $140,000 in a single night of gambling . But last week , at the payoff , he could n't command a battalion . His order to the bodyguards to resist never reached them because the messenger was intercepted . A few loyal bodyguards shot up three soldiers , and with that the last remnant of Farouk 's power evaporated . <P> Always a realist , he accepted the ultimatum of an obscure general delivered by a turncoat politician . He abdicated , and quit Egypt within the six hours specified . As he stood on the quay to embark , his huge , beefy frame encased in a white naval uniform , tears spilled down his cheeks . Twenty-one guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( meaning Protected ) put past the harbor 's red and green entrance lights and steamed for Italy . It carried Farouk , his 19-year-old wife , their seven-month-old son , now King Fuad II , and 204 royal trunks . <P> The Egyptians he left behind laughed and shouted and pumped each other 's hands , Alexandria had not seen such a happy outpouring since another day 16 years ago . That day there were also Royal Air Force planes overhead and a 21-gun salute . Tall , handsome , slender King Farouk had come home from school in England ( the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich ) , to replace his recently dead father , plump Fuad I. Wrote the New York Times correspondent : " Farouk has won the hearts of his people by his democratic manner . " Last week , the independent newspaper El Akhbar of Cairo updated the story : " Today , history records the name of an oppressive and unjust King ... A King who used the influence of the monarch to flog the backs of the liberals , who imposed misery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tyranny justice , his corruption reform , and his immorality piety . " * <P> The Palestine Scandal . The indictment was overdrawn but not incorrect . Farouk , who could have been an uncommonly intelligent and able King ( and occasionally was ) , turned out in the main to be an uncommonly gross and unrestrained one . He gave free rein to all his appetites-from women to power , and treated his Premiers as he did his girl friends , changing them constantly ( five Premiers in one six-month period ) . After the birth of his only son he made a valiant effort to straighten up , and brought in honest Premier Hilary Pasha to purge the corruption that was endangering the government . But inevitably , Hilaly 's probings led close to Farouk 's palace gang , and the King dumped the honest Premier . <P> That was his fatal error . For among the dirty deals that Hilaly was tracking down was the Palestine arms scandal . <P> In 1948 , young , alert field officers returned from the Israeli war , having suffered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For their defeat they blamed the inept , lazy officers who ran the War Ministry and also Farouk , for he meddled in the army , promoting the inept officers , including the worst of all , General Mohammed Haidar Pasha , the commander in chief .
