txt The Seventh Avenue approach to the Narrows bridge that will link Brooklyn and Staten Island was upheld today by Governor Rockefeller . With an unusually long explanation , the Governor vetoed a bill that would have required the Brooklyn approach to the $320,000,000 span to double back abruptly and follow Shore Parkway . The Seventh Avenue route will carry the approach straight off the bridge through residential Bay Ridge . The measure was supported in the Legislature by a number of Brooklyn Republicans , some of whom credit their election in the predominantly Democratic borough to the bridge issue . Its disapproval , however reluctantly , by a Republican Governor may pose substantial political problems for them . Expresses Sympathy " I fully understand and sympathize with the deep feelings of those who have personal roots , and economic investment , or both , in property lying in the path of the proposed Seventh Avenue approach , " Mr. Rockefeller said in his 1,800-word veto memorandum . Despite the possible validity of arguments for the Shore Parkway route , the Governor said , " the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of practical foreclosure of consideration of any route other than the Seventh Avenue approach . " Those who favored the vetoed bill contended that the alternate approach would save 2,500 Bay Ridge homes from destruction , prevent the displacement of 10,000 people , save $80,000,000 in condemnation costs and prevent New York City from losing $1,000,000 a year in taxes . Arguments Outlined In support of his insistence on the Seventh Avenue route , Mr. Rockefeller marshaled these major arguments : The Shore Parkway approach would require the reloi cation of almost as many families as the Seventh Avenue : 1,550 compared with 1,577. ( lThe Shore Parkway route would cost either $101,500,000 or $163,700,000 , depending on ihow it was built , while the Seventh Avenue route will cost only $78,700,000. tiThe Shore Parkway route would be almost 70 per cent longer and divert nearly half the bridge traffic away from its destination . IINew York City , through all its agencies , has supported the Seventh Avenue approach and " the views of the Mayor and the governing bodies of the city must be given great . weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New . York Authority , which will build the span , and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority , which Will operate it both strongly favor the Seventh Avenue route , as does the State Public Works Department . 1Federal highway officials have approved the Seventh ' Avenue route , . but " expressed grave doubts " about the alternate ; upon their approval rests the 8108,000,000 Federal share of the cost of building the bridge approaches and connecting expressways. 41The Shore Parkway route would take much more  --  perhaps all  --  of the Army installation at Fort Hamilton , another threat to Federal approval of that plan : Federal Role Cited Mr. Rockefeller pointed out that approval of the bill would mandate the Shore Parkway ap- , proach . If the bill were signed ) and the Federal Government refused to accept that route , it could force abandonment of his bridge altogether and endanger the arterial highway plan for , the entire metropolitan area . The Governor also noted that the city and the state . had already invested about $10,000 , - 000 in engineering studies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reimburse 90 per cent of this sum if the bridge project is abandoned , he said . Mr. Rockefeller recalled that former Gov . W. Averell HkTiman had disapproved similar bills in 1957 and 1958 , on essentially the same reasoning . " In reaching . this conclusion , " the Governor observed , " I have given every consideration to the unfortunate impact on the individuals and families which the furtherance of the Narrows Bridge and the Seventh Avenue route will create . " It is a sacrifice by these citizens on behalf of the people of the city and the state as awhole . " The Republican legislators from Brooklyn who are most critically affected by approval of the Seventh Avenue route are Senator William T. Conklin and Assemblymen Frank J. , Luigi R. Marano , and , to a lesser extent , Harry J. Donnelly . Mr. has survived Democratic assaults in his Bay Ridge district since 1944 , but the seats of Senator Conklin and Mr. Marano , through whose districts the Seventh Avenue approach cuts , weie held by Democrats until 1956 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of votes .
