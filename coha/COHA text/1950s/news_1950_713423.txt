txt Now it 's flying ice cubes . A block of ice a foot square hurtled through the asbestos roof of a garage in suburban Wandsworth on Nov. 24 . Scotland Yard was called in . At the same time star gazers in southern Ireland and southern England reported they saw some more flying saucers ? now a rather commonplace report . But giant flying ice cubes  --  that was something new . " There was a noise like a terrific explosion and I thought at first that the boiler had gone up . " reported George Cooper . the garage watchman . " The asbestos roof caved in and part of the corrugated section fell in , too . No one was hurt . We were all covered with dust and pieces of asbestos . " Mr. Cooper called in the police , and right away they ruled out the possibility that the big ice cube fell from a plane . Said an expert at the Air Ministry meteorological office : " I do not think that a lump of ice that size can be a normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailstones , but those conditions were not existing today , and in any case , hailstones would not be so large . " Two weeks ago in Exmoor , farmers found lumps of ice weighing 12 to 14 pounds . One farmer found a sheep dead , with a deep wound in its neck . Next to it was a giant ice cube , embedded in the earth . Two fliers over southern England reported seeing flying saucers , The Irish flying saucer  --  appropriately , it was green with spots of blue and red  --  was reported over Limerick by three men , a ' : from different parts of the city . The flying ice cube was taken away by police and stashed in a refrigerator for further investigation . Nobody said whether there might be any connection between ice cubes and saucers.
