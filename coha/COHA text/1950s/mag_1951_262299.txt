In a Manhattan courtroom , General Sessions Judge Saul Streit addressed himself to an unpleasant duty . Awaiting sentence before him were 14 college boys under indictment in the New York basketball fix scandal. * All had pleaded guilty . Judge Streit listened gravely to the recommendations of the district attorney , who wanted the boys left unpunished as an encouragement to others to testify against the gamblers . Then the court announced his decision . <P> He sent five players to prison for terms ranging from six months to three years . He freed nine on probation , and he sent Master Fixer Salvatore Sollazzo to prison for an 8-to-16-year term . But before the shocked and shaken prisoners were led away , Judge Streit angrily underlined one inescapable fact : " The responsibility . . . must be shared not only by the crooked fixers and the corrupt players , but also by the college administrations , coaches and alumni groups . . . " <P> Vicious Pattern . Slender , studious Judge Streit was never much of an athlete himself , but as a five-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew just where to dig around in the shabby woodwork . Block by block he built up a ringing , 41-page indictment of big-time intercollegiate athletics . Said he : " The exposure before me is only the lifting of the curtain for a small glimpse of intercollegiate football and basketball , fired by commercialism and determination to win at all costs . " <P> Behind the curtain , Judge Streit found a vicious pattern of commercialized recruiting that begins with athletic scholarships and falsified admission records , proceeds through four years of such cinch courses as music appreciation and finger painting , and winds up with a squad of athletic hirelings who may be easy touches for fast-talking fixers . Among his findings : <P> " Flagrant recruiting , proselyting and subsidizing " among big-time college football powers . Among the chief offenders : Maryland , Tennessee , Oklahoma and Southern Methodist ( which awards 154 athletic scholarships every year ) . <P> " Deliberate fraud and probable forgery " in academic admission records at City College of New York , where one player 's high-school average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised ten points , to make them eligible for admission , i.e. , to play on C.C.N.Y. 's basketball team . <P> Basketball players , " masquerading as amateurs , " who earned as much as $2,000 on summer jobs while playing in summer tournaments . <P> Big-business commercialism in schools like Kentucky , which grossed $1,200,000 in football gate receipts last year . <P> An offer to and acceptance by one player at Cincinnati University of scholarships " both for himself and his non-playing brother , which included tuition , board , a job , $50 a month expense money , and the use of a car . " <P> Said Streit : " The naivet , the equivocation and the denials of the coaches and their assistants concerning their knowledge of gambling , recruiting and subsidizing would be comical were they not so despicable .
