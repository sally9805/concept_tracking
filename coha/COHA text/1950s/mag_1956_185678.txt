The last time Tito saw Paris was as an undercover Communist agent during the Spanish civil war . Traveling on forged papers as a Czech named Jaromir Havlicek , he set up headquarters in a Left Bank fleabag to arrange the dispatch of 1,500 Yugoslav volunteers to fight for Loyalist Spain . The police kept an eye on him . <P> Last week , resplendently uniformed in sky blue , Yugoslavia 's Dictator-President Josip Broz Tito arrived in Paris on a visit of state , and was even more thoroughly watched-this time as an endangered rather than a dangerous individual . A jittery French government could not help remembering that the last visit to France of a Yugoslav head of state , in 1934 , had ended in the assassination in Marseille of both Yugoslavia 's King Alexander and France 's Foreign Minister Louis Barthou , who was riding with him . <P> Clearing the Way . Long before Tito and his Junoesque wife arrived at the Bois de Boulogne Station in their special blue and silver armor-plated train , all known anti-Titoist refugees in Paris were placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , along with a motley crew of anarchists , royalists , diehard Yugoslav Catholics and Cominform Communists , and shipped off to Corsica for a week 's vacation-food , wine and sightseeing-at France 's expense . A small army of about 15,000 police , plainclothesmen , helmeted Gardes Republicaines and firemen were deployed over Paris to help keep the peace . Along the route of march from the railroad station to the Elysee Palace , where the visitors were to stay , Parisian firemen stood watch on rooftops , and every chestnut tree shaded a cop or a detective . Public sewers and private houses along the way had been combed by security men , and wooden barriers , well guarded by the police , had been set up to hold the welcoming crowds out of bomb-throwing range . Even Tito himself was impressed . " Things are not even this tight in Russia , " he remarked . " I never saw anything like it . " <P> Neither , many a Parisian agreed , had Paris itself , not even in the dark days when Adolf Hitler came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his official hosts swept freely along cleared boulevards in the city , the plain citizens of Paris found their own progress blocked at every turn . Never smooth flowing , the city 's traffic became a nightmare of confusion as main thoroughfares were blocked off for hours at a time . <P> Quiet Talk . Here and there in the confusion tempers flared , and small angry clashes occurred between police and citizens . Newsmen and photographers were beaten , a priest was arrested , teen-age boys were hauled off to jail for demonstrating with posters ( RETURN GOD TO YUGOSLAVIA ) and shouting , " Free Cardinal Stepinac ! " <P> In the midst of it all and far removed from the madding and maddened crowds , Tito and his host , Premier Guy Mollet , found time for some quiet talk . Together they agreed on the necessity for disarmament and the necessity to maintain a wary attitude toward Russia in spite of its new face . Tito also expressed to his host a hope for " a liberal solution of the Algerian problem , " which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
