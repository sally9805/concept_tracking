Ever since he paced Dr. Roger Bannister to the world 's first four-minute mile ( TIME , May 17 ) , Distance Runner Chris Chataway has been a British favorite . Even though he won the three-mile race at the Empire Games in August , most of his fans remember him as the man who always finishes second . Last summer , at the European championships in Bern , Chris managed to nose out the great Czech runner , Emil Zatopek , in the 5,000- meter run-and still he finished second , behind Russia 's Vladimir Kuc ( rhymes with coots ) . <P> When British authorities invited Moscow to send a track and field squad to London for an intercity meet , one night last week , Londoners were mainly interested in the 5,000-meter race and Chris Chataway 's chance for revenge . The Soviets , as usual , were interested in anything they could win . <P> Although their invitation called for only 30 athletes , the Soviets sent a squad of 69 , promised to pick up the tab for the extra guests , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got to London , the Soviet trackmen put in a hard morning of training , and turned in early . " The one who has trained the hardest will win , " said cocksure Champion Kuc . British sportswriters agreed : they knew that Chataway spends precious little time on the track , smokes , drinks beer , and is notoriously lazy about training . " It is fascinating to read all the gibberish which is being written and spoken about sporting good will between the two nations , " said the Daily Mirror 's Peter Wilson , " when all the good is on our side and all the will ( to win ) is on theirs . " <P> In the 5,000-meter race , no one could have doubted Chataway 's will to win . As expected , Kuc jumped into an early lead , but Chataway was right on his heels . When the Russian.sprinted , Chataway turned on the power and stayed with him . Lap after lap they rounded the track , close as a pair of vaudeville tap dancers . The Russian could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , a spotlight focused on the pair and picked up Chataway 's final move . His smooth style remained , but there was no sign of the stamina needed for a sprint when the Briton moved out on the track to get racing room . Fifty yards from the tape , he was half a pace back . Twenty-five yards to go , and he was still behind . But the gap was smaller now . By the time they passed the tape , Chris Chataway , the man who always finishes second , was first by a stride . His time : 13:51.6 , a new world 's record . <P> <P> Moscow won an easy team victory ( 159-89 ) , but for London , the 5,000-meter race was the meet . Only Chris Chataway had some sober second thoughts . Looking ahead to the next Olympics , he shook his head and mumbled : " I 'd still back Zatopek to beat us both . "
