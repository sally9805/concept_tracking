TIES Prime Minister Says Regime Will Support Eisenhower to Its ' Utmost Limit ' Special to Tim NEW Yeas Tablas . LONDON , Nov. ** Minister Churchill , touching on a variety of issues being considered by world powers , said tonight it would be dishonorable to end the Korean war at the cost of sending back Chinese prisoners to be slaughtered by the Communists . One thing that is " never worth doing , is to purchase peace at the price of dishonor , " he said . " It would be dishonor to send thousands of helpless prisoners of war back by force to be massacred by a Chinese Communist Government that boasts that it has actually rid itself of two millions of its own people , " he added . Mr. Churchill was the principal speaker at the Lord Mayor 's dinner at the Guildhall . A large part of his speech was devoted to the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Korea . The Prime Minister declared that eager as he was to bring about an early end of the war in Xorea and sympathetic as he was to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower 's design to do so , in the judgment of Britain it would be dishonorable to do so at the cost of returning prisoners to be massacred . German Role Held Vital He said that in Europe there could be no defense of Western culture and freedom unless Germany played an effective part . Turning- to Middle East affairs , Mr. Churchill said that while his Government desired friendship With the new Egyptian Government and was willing to help it , he had no intention of being diverted from his country 's international responsibility there . The defense of the Suez Canal is of vast importance to the whole free world , he declared . Mr. Churchill said his Government would cooperate with the new United States Administration " to the utmost limit of our strength " for the " great causes which we have guarded and cherished in ever greater unity as the generations have rolled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political cleavage with the extreme left wing of the Labor party led by Aneurin Bevan , which has been extremely critical of General Eisenhower , and of a desire to get along well with the new United States Government . Mr. Churchill , who himself proposed a peace-seeking journey to Moscow in the midst of the British campaign of 1950 , said he was not // at all surprised by General Eisenhower 's proposal to visit Korea on a fact-finding mission . There is no doubt at all that the absorption of so large a proportion of United Nations forces in the Far ' Eastsuits the design of the Kremlin , the Prime Minister declared . " It is a convenient way of dispersing the strength of the free world and preventing , or at least delaying , the building up of a secure defense against the subjugation of a western Europe , " he added . " For these reasons I have always been anxious to bring the conflict in Korea to an end as speedily as possible and to keep it within the strictest limits while it lasts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , Mr. Churchill said it had given him a pain to see so many of his former comrades in arms fighting each other so bitterly . He added that there was one consolalation for him , however , and that was that " nothing like that could have happened ; ' in the Soviet Union or the satellite states . Behind the Iron Curtain " all is presented with glacial decorum , " he said . Nevertheless , an outside observer from the , West can not help wondering what happened to the 2 per cent who always seem to vote as independents , he added . The big question in his mind is whether they are rewarded or punished for providing the window dressing of elections , he commented . The Prime Minister 's speech was the climax of the ceremonies connected with the inauguration of Sir Rupert de la Sere , the new Lord Mayor of the City of London . It was preceded by the traditional and colorful Lord Mayor 's parade .               @ @ @ @ @ @
