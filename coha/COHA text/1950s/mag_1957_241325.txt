Ghoulish or Great ? <P> <P> Sir : <P> Your May 27 article on Picasso , assisted by wonderful reproductions , will be of much help in aiding the readers to understand and appreciate him . Picasso 's art truly manifests the spirit of our wondrous age . No artist before him has been able to portray emotion on canvas in such a way . <P> HENRY MATTHEWS <P> Norwich , Conn . <P> <P> Sir : <P> For a man who knows " there are vitamins even in garbage , " Picasso has parlayed inventiveness into a sizable garbage can . Art always contains elements of invention , but invention is not necessarily art . The final caricature by this apocryphal " genius " is the comparison of himself with Raphael . <P> <P> CHARLES B. ROGERS <P> Huntington Hartford Foundation Pacific Palisades , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Your Picasso spread was one of the most interesting I have ever read . The reproductions are by far the finest I have seen , and will make a wonderful addition to my TIME art collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Sir : <P> How can you possibly desecrate and denigrate art by publishing under its aegis those nightmarish horrors by Picasso ? That legendary character is fooling no one but himself with his ghoulish atrocities . Of his more conventional paintings , the " Mother and Child " is a poor imitation of Michelangelo 's . <P> <P> W. G. SARGENT <P> South Bend , Wash . <P> <P> Sir : <P> While rephrasing the standard cultist glosses of art-clown Picasso 's work , your art editor must not have considered the more appropriate evaluation best expressed by Picasso himself : " I am only a public entertainer ... I am celebrated ; I am rich . But when I am face to face with myself , I have not the courage to consider myself an artist in the great and ancient sense of the word . . . " <P> <P> GERALD H. WHIPPLE Foxborough , Mass . <P> All in a Nutshell <P> In the May 13 issue you mentioned a 60-year-old Philadelphia woman who got a skin rash after gathering cashew nuts in Ceylon . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with a hard tough shell that has a thin layer of black oil underneath . This oil is quite corrosive to the skin . It is in the shell , however , which is left in India - in fact is used for fuel-and is not in the kernel that we eat . <P> In the processing plants here , the nuts are shelled by hand after being roasted to make the shell soft and brittle . The shelling is done by women . Each woman has a pan of ashes by her , and after shelling two or three nuts she dips her hands into the ashes , which protect the fingers from the corrosive oil . In this way they shell nuts all day , everyday , for weeks and months on end , and never have any skin trouble . <P> <P> ROY SELLERS <P> U.S. Department of Agriculture Bombay <P> A Question of Race <P> Sir : <P> In describing Irish Gallant Man , unlucky second in the Kentucky Derby , as English-bred , TIME May 20 has blundered and been unhorsed . The colt , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was foaled and reared at the Aga Khan 's stud in County Kildare , Ireland , at whose studs in that county both his sire and dam were foaled . <P> <P> D. L.
