txt BONN , Germany , Feb. 26 ? A constitutional amendment authorizing rearmament in West Germany was approved today by the Bundestag , the lower : house of Parliament , but it probably will be put into cold storage until France has had a chance to act on the European Defense Community Treaty . Apparently in deference to French feelings the Government party leaders hushed members of the Bundestag who started to applaud the favorable vote this afternoon . The vote was 334 to 144 . Only 325 affirmative votes of the Bundestag 's 487 members were required for the necessary twothirds majority to approve the amendment . Presumably all of the opposing votes were cast by the Social Democrats . In mustering his majority , Chancellor Konrad Adenauer called back deputies from the far corners of the earth . Wilhelm Kopf returned from a safari in Ethiopia . Viktoria Steinbiss gave , up a lecture tour in Chicago. , Karl Hanh , suffering from a conH cussion of the brain , was carried into the Parliament building on a stretcher . Free Democrats Yield Dr. Adenauer also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free Democratic ' , party , one of the units in his coalition , to withdraw their objections to the amendment . Their votes were-needed to re- , move legal doubts about the right lot the Bundestag to ratify the defense community treaty and raise military contingents for the army it provides . Last May the Bonn Parliament , ratified the defense community treaty and the accompanying , peace contracts with the Western Allies . However , its action was challenged by the Social Democratic party in the Federal Constitutional Court on the ground that the Constitution made no provision for rearmament . The three-part amendment approved today would rectify that omission and authorize the Federal Government to ' take measures for national defense , mili-1 tary conscription and civil defense . It also would specifically declare that the defense community treaty and the peace contracts were not in conflict with the West German Constitution . Allies ' Approval Required - Before the amendrrient can take effect it must be approved also by . the Bundesrat , the upper house of Parliament , aid have the express approval of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights as occupying powers . It is understood that the three powers have no objection to the amendment as such . They are said to believe it merely clarifies the authority that , in their opinion , the Bonn Government al'ready possesses . ' However , the French are believed to have doubts about the Propriety of giving legal sanction to German rearmament before the National Assembly in Paris has acted on the defense community treaty . That treaty was originally designed to limit and control - German military power by integrating West Germany 's forces into a European army . The other members of the army would be France , Italy , Belgium , the Netherlands and // Luxembourg . Britain would be closely associated with it . If West Germany is authorized to rearm before the defense community safeguards are in effect , it is feared ere that French suspicions ma be aroused and French ratification of the treaty may be imperiled . That situation was discussed Wednesday evening by Andre Francois - Poncet , French High Commissioner , and Dr. James B. Conant , United States High Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission in Bonn . The High Commissioners were said to have found it was not necessary to take a final decision at once , The Bundesrat will not consider the amendment until about March 19 and therefore the matter will not reach the Allied High Commissioners until nearly a month from now , Meanwhile , Georges Bidault , French Foreign Minister , is pressing for a debate on the defense community treaty in Paris before the conference on Far East issues in Geneva , April 26 . If the rearmament amendment is presented to the High Commissioners before the French debate they can delay action on it or stipulate that it must not be used as a basis for rearmament legislation until France 's verdict - on the defense community - has been rendered . Meantime , the United States , Britain and France are agreed it probably is best for Dr. Adenauer to put the amendment through the upper house while his twothirds majority is secure and intact . Later , he may alienate some of the majority by concessions to France on the Saar problem or other issues . To get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need only a simple majority .
