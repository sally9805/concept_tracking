Mercedes-Benz , in this fourth year of its postwar resurrection , has become to motor racing what Rocky Marciano is to heavyweight boxing  --  a seemingly invincible combination of tremendous stamina and superb preparedness . This was proved once more , and conclusively , at Liverpool 's Aintree Course last Saturday when the trim , silver cars from West Germany , with Stirling Moss in the lead , scooped the eighth British Grand Prix in the first quadruple victory in Grand Prix history . // For Moss it was a personal triumph , the realization of a lifelong ambition : his first Grand Prix conquest . It was a dramatic grandstand finish , too , as Moss , leader by a hair-thin margin for 80 laps , swept across the line one-fifth of a second ahead of his Argentinian teammate Fangio ; and the 150,000 Britons pyramided around the track forgot all their reserve as they burst through the barriers to congratulate their national hero . It came almost as an afterthought that , with Kling third and Taruffi fourth , the German team had also broken Ferrari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British event . // Aintree is a brutally hard circuit on engines , a destructive acceleration battle with only brief breathing spells in fourth speed . Said Moss : " I must have changed gears 2,000 times for those 90 laps . " What this did to the rest of the field is evident from the fact that only nine of the 24 starters lasted the race , and of the Italian , British and French opposition , only one Maserati finished in good shape , tailing the fourth Mercedes by nearly two minutes . // For the start , Moss held the pole position with the fastest practice lap  --  89.70 mph . Fangio , two-tenths of a second slower , was beside him , then Behra with the 250F Maserati . Kling and Taruffi shared the second row , and in the third were the Maseratis of Mieres and Simon , with Schell 's fuel-injection British Vanwall between them . // From the start , Mercedes held the lead and it was a two-way battle between Moss and Fangio all the way . Fangio , in No. 10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 and a close-packed field . On lap three Moss passed him , holding first position until the 18th lap when the Argentinian world champion again went ahead . On the 26th lap , Moss took command once more to stay ahead until the checkered flag . Behra 's Maserati , just ahead of Kling and Taruffi but 10 seconds behind the leaders , staged a valiant battle for third place until the ninth lap , when it stopped in a cloud of smoke . // The Maseratis of Mieres and Musso got by Taruffi 's Mercedes , but on lap 48 Mieres quit with piston trouble . Try as he might , Musso could make no impression on Kling , who in turn was one minute 10 seconds behind the two leaders at the halfway mark . Finally , on lap 55 , Taruffi after many tries repassed Musso and gradually pulled away , completing the Mercedes quartet . Veteran " Silver Fox " Taruffi 's performance was magnificent . Clad in his perennial blue pullover , getting dirtier every lap , handling a car he had never driven until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he clung grimly to fourth spot , one lap behind . // The works Ferraris of Trintignant , Hawthorn and Castellotti were disappointing . Castellotti , never higher than eighth , retired on lap 18 with transmission trouble . Trintignant , seventh on lap 61 , blew a cylinder-head gasket . Hawthorn , cooked by the sun 's rays filtering through his visor , was seventh when he handed over to Castellotti on the 47th lap . This car eventually finished sixth , three laps behind the leaders . The Gordinis of Ramos and Manzon , hopelessly outclassed , both retired early , leaving Sparken 's lame Gordini to struggle on to the end . // Fangio 's smile was a trifle wan as the bouquets were handed out . Said he in his voluble Spanish : " My congratulations to Moss . He is a wonderful driver . I had a lot of fun following him . " To which Moss , who took the laurels at 86.47 mph and set a new lap record at 89.70 mph , sportingly retorted : " If Fangio had tried a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The 17-lap 51-mile sports car race preceding the Grand Prix was an all-British affair which drew 22 entries . After the third lap , when Salvadori , Collins , Parnell and Walker in turn each got by Mike Hawthorn 's D-type Jaguar , it also become an all Aston-Martin affair . In fact , the stalwart Aston-Martins had no trouble in eventually disposing altogether of the three D-Jaguars driven by Hawthorn , Titterington and Berry . Peter Collins , first to tackle Hawthorn on Becher 's bend , put up the fastest lap at 83.33 mph . Roy Salvadori 's winning speed was 81.32 mph . Only 1.7 seconds separated the first three cars . // There were 30 starters in the opening event , also of 51 miles , for 500-cc Formula 3 machines ; and the blip of their exhausts , garlanded around the course , sounded like a field day for noisemakers . Russell 's Cooper-Norton , which passed Lewis Evans ' similar car on lap seven , went on to win a hard-fought battle and set a new lap record of 79.53 mph . Fergusson in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders lapped the field at half-distance and Russell clocked a sizzling 78.19 mph.
