Associated Press , the world 's largest news agency , last week started a brand-new service : television film news . A.P . was simply giving in to the inevitable . Both of its biggest U.S. competitors , United Press and International News Service , are already deep in the TV news field , provide stations with special scripts and daily news film . In the last few years TV news has become so important that A.P . could no longer afford to stay out . But despite all the money and time spent on TV , the news programs are still far short of the telecasters ' dreams . Even newspapers which own TV stations now realize that covering news for TV is not like reporting : it is an entirely new , costly and different job , that can not simply be grafted on to newspaper operations . <P> The new job must be learned the hard way , one expensive step after another . As a result , cost-conscious TV stations still rely on network news shows , wire-service newsreels , or on such local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading bulletins , or a display of still pictures , headlines and press-service bulletins flashed on a screen . <P> Camera Chase . To learn the new job , some newspaper-owned stations , such as the New York Daily News 's WPIX , the Chicago Tribime 's WGN-TV and the Fort Worth Star-Tele gram 's WBAP-TV , have set up separate TV desks , with a staff of newsmen and newsreel and TV cameramen . Even with all that , covering live spot news is often impossible . For example , when a freight plane crashed in Jamaica , N.Y . two weeks ago ( TIME , April 14 ) , a WPIX camera crew found it could not send on-the-spot broadcasts , though it was only ten miles from the station ; a ridge was between it and the station 's transmitter . Moreover , even getting to the scene of the news is often a problem , since TV camera crews can not be shunted around as easily as reporters and photographers can . But RCA may soon help overcome that . It is working on a one-man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a TV cameraman almost as mobile as a reporter with copy-paper and pencil . <P> Despite the troubles , those willing to spend money on TV coverage think the results are worth it , especially as advertisers snap up TV news shows . The Los Angeles Times 's and the Mirror 's KTTV has one of the most energetic newspaper-owned TV news setups in the U.S. , including fourteen staffers and camera crews . It thinks $5,470 a week for TV news-gathering is well spent . One of its best local stunts : when a three-year-old girl disappeared recently , the station assigned four cameras ( TV and newsreel ) to the hunt . Three followed the search party and another , set up in the girl 's home , was able to catch her reunion with her mother . <P> No Competition . For all its faults , TV coverage has already added new worries for newspaper reporters . On a big story , the principals often have little time to talk to newsmen : they want to do all their talking in front of TV cameras . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been beaten by pictures snapped from the TV screen in the office . And editors , sitting before a TV set in the office , have often been able to point out caustically things that their reporters on the spot have missed .
