Without warning , all scheduled broadcasts on the Israeli radio were canceled one night last week . Instead , listeners heard the weary voice of outgoing Finance Minister Eliezer Kaplan : starting in 48 hours , Israelis would have to turn in their old currency , printed in 1948 , and would receive new notes in return . As each Israeli shoved his currency through the bank window , the teller would automatically deduct 10% on all notes of five Israeli pounds and above , as a complusory government loan , repayable in 15 years with 4% annual interest . Bank deposits of 50 and above would be assessed in the same way . <P> Only a handful of Israeli leaders knew what Kaplan was going , to say , but all Israelis had been expecting something drastic . Their new country simply has not been able to make ends meet . All but $2,000,000 of the $200 million in loans and grants-in-aid from the U.S. Government has been spent . ( Israel has received a larger share per capita of U.S. grants and loans than any nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $65 million U.S. grants-in-aid intended for capital improvements had to be diverted to pay current bills . With an expensive army and ambitious capital improvements to be paid for , with imports running eight times greater than exports , infant Israel has been playing tag with bankruptcy . <P> The compulsory loan , said the government , would 1 ) raise an extra $25 million for capital improvements , 2 ) reduce the inflationary pressure which has doubled and trebled some prices since February , 3 ) expose the black-marketeers and currency speculators who hold much of Israel 's large-denomination banknotes . The Israeli government has promised that the nation would be solvent by 1958 . But would the first forced loan be the last ? Nervous Israelis hurried off to the nearest jewelers , to convert currency into fluctuation-proof diamonds .
