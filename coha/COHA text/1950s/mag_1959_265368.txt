North Carolina , observed Historian Arnold Toynbee in 1939 , enjoys a " springlike burgeoning of life " because , unlike other Deep South states , it is not " a country living under a spell . " The most important new fact about the U.S. South in the spring of 1959 : burgeoning North Carolina , too busy in pursuit of 20th century economic development to be inhibited by diehard last stands against school integration , has quietly taken over the mantle of Southern leadership that Virginia wore so long , so proudly . <P> Springlike Tarheel vigor was at work last week from Kitty Hawk to Cherokee , from missile plant to church pulpit , reshaping a landscape once principally adorned by loblolly pine , flue-cured tobacco and two-room farm shacks . Near Laurinburg , Presbyterians broke ground for a new college , a few weeks behind the Methodist groundbreaking for a college at Rocky Mount and three years behind the brand-new $19 million campus of Baptist-affiliated Wake Forest College in Winston-Salem . All were additions to Dixie 's best college complex , fed by Dixie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Piedmont , engineers mapped sites for nuclear , chemical and industrial research labs in a new , 4,000-acre " Research Triangle . " East of Charlotte 's booming suburbs , Alcoa let $40 million worth of contracts to expand its aluminum plant . Over the South 's best highway net , semitrailers snorted day and night to serve a state economy so vigorous that it kept right on growing through the late recession . <P> Up from Segregation . In the solid granite Capitol in Raleigh , white-haired Governor Luther Hartwell Hodges , 61 , businessman turned politician , totted up some headline statistics that proved the vigor behind his fondest dream : from January to March , industry built some $25,000,000 worth of new plants in North Carolina to add 5,600 new jobs ( up 40% over 1958 ) paying $16 million a year ( up 46% ) to the state 's payrolls . Showing its heels to its industry-hungry neighbors , North Carolina would almost certainly better its 1958 total of $253,000,000 in new-plant investment , tops for the South. * <P> Behind the thriving economy lay an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that recognized long ago that good schools , expanding culture and economic development were too vital to be stopped short by a fight over integration . Like all Southern states , North Carolina met its toughest test after the Supreme Court 's 1954 decision . But guided by able leadership , it did not panic . Instead it plotted minimum but legal compliance , went on to more important business-and in so doing soon put the crisis in reasonable perspective . Part of the credit was due to Governor Hodges and his sharp eye for business ; part of it was due to the special heritage of the state that produced both Hodges and the kind of climate that he could operate in.
