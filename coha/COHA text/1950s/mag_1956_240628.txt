The fastest-rising figure in U.S. radio is Omaha 's R. ( for Robert ) Todd Storz , 32 , whose low estimate of listeners ' intelligence is tempered only by his high regard for their cupidity . On the four Storz-owned stations in Omaha , New Orleans , Minneapolis and Kansas City , he has found that giveaways work even better for stations than they do for individual programs . Storz shovels out jackpots in a succession of quizzes , guessing games and treasure hunts that occasionally tie up traffic when the search is on . This cash-and-harry formula is so popular with listeners and advertisers that Storz in six years has run a $20,000 investment of his own , plus $30,000 from his father , into a $2,500,000 network . Last week , in his biggest deal to date , he paid $850,000 for Miami 's WQAM and prepared to test Florida 's IQ . <P> When his listeners are not being told about a new giveaway , they get a steady serenade from disk jockeys , broken only by stunts and five-minute newscasts . Storz permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records at a time , lets them play only the 40 top tunes of the week , well larded with commercials . <P> Storz newscasts , which ignore the U.N . for other international bodies , e.g. , Anita Ekberg , are aired five minutes before every hour , so that they can catch listeners who switch off other stations ' on the-hour announcements . Last week Storz was warming the mikes in Omaha and Minneapolis for " the biggest one-shot giveaway of all time on either radio or TV . " The prize : two bank drafts for $105,000 , each hidden within a ten-mile radius of Storz 's Stations KOHW and WGDY. which will start broadcasting clues next week . ( The insurance group underwriting the prize estimates that there is only one chance in 47 that Storz will have to pay off . ) If the booty goes un-found by June 17 , Storz will pay only $500 consolation prizes to the hunters who eventually stumble onto the two hiding places . <P> " Turn the Set Off . " Todd Storz first got interested in radio as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army , he passed up the family brewery to take a whirl at being a disk jockey . He lasted only a short while after advising a woman who had written in to complain about his record selections : " Ma'am , on your radio you will find a switch which will easily turn the set off . " In 1949 , after working for another station as a salesman , Storz heard that Omaha 's pioneer KOHW was on the block for $75,000 . With his father he formed the Mid-Continent Co. , borrowed enough to buy the ailing station .
