Sometimes It Is a Thingumajig <P> THE No. 1 worry of U.S. businessmen is a " recession . " But the strange fact is that nobody seems to know exactly what a recession is . The word is as hard to define as love . <P> One trouble is that such expressions as " depression " and " recession " have become bad words , particularly among politicians , and are never to be used if a nicer word can be found . Thus , a whole new vocabulary has evolved . In the new jargon , a recession can be a " rolling readjustment , " a " correction , " a " slippage , " an " easing , " a " mild dip , " a " downswing , " a " normal adjustment , " a " leveling off , " a " slight downturn , " a " lull , " a " return to normalcy " or a " thingumajig . " These euphemisms , of course , also defy definition . What , for instance , is a " return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what economic normalcy is ? <P> There are some brave souls who attempt to define recession in specific terms . The results are just as baffling . To retailers , a recession is a drop in sales , but they will differ as to whether it is a 5% or a 20% drop . To manufacturers , industrial production is the yardstick ; to labor leaders , unemployment ; to Wall Streeters , stock prices . <P> A recession , says Harvard 's Economist Sumner Slichter , is " no more than a momentary drop in employment and production " - and the U.S. " is in one right now . " " Of course we 're in a recession , " agrees Economist A. W. Zelomek , president of the International Statistical Bureau . But Zelomek 's idea of recession may startle many businessmen . " At the bottom , " says he , " we 'll be way above the prosperity levels of pre-Korea . " Staff Chief Grover Ensley of the Joint Committee on the Economic Report has still another view of what is happening . Says he : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of the recessionary type , is of the downward type . " <P> Where does recession end and depression begin ? New Dealing Economist Robert Nathan defines a depression as a sharp decline that lasts a few years . A decline that lasts only six months to a year and a half could be called a recession . To Nathan , depression means 7,000,000 to 8,000,000 unemployed ( v. 1,200,000 today ) ; recession means 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 unemployed for six to 18 months . Another New-Fair Dealer , Economist Leon Keyserling , describes a recession as a " short-run downturn of moderate or even large proportions . " The Commerce Department 's Under Secretary Walter Williams talks darkly of the time when " soft spots merge and a breakthrough is imminent . " Treasury 's Deputy Secretary Randolph Burgess is precise . A recession exists , says he , only when gross national product falls at least 5% ( which would mean a drop from the current $371 billion to $352 billion ) . <P> Recession has been robbed of its meaning because past recessions have borne little similarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1920-21 , 1937-38 and 1949 , had quite different characteristics . <P>
