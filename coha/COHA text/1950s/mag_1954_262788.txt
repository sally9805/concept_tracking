Before dawn , some 400 Mau Mau came out of their strongholds to fight in the open . They first raided the white man 's clubhouse at Thika , 34 miles northeast of Nairobi . They dragged out the African barman and slashed him to bits with their sharp pangas ; they tore up a picture of Sir Winston Churchill , downed all the mineral water in the bar , and made off towards the police post at Kandara , 16 miles away . At 9:30 a.m. they confidently attacked the post in bright sunshine-but the British were ready and waiting . A relieving column of the King 's African Rifles thundered up to the post as the Mau Mau closed in , and the riflemen leaped from their trucks and charged . One 23-year-old lieutenant bayoneted eight Mau Mau . " I was lucky , " said he . " I happened to be well placed . " In all , the Mau Mau lost 39 at Kandara . British losses : none . <P> Commanding General Sir George Erskine sent his 39th Brigade in pursuit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a river crossing , ambushed another in the Maragua Valley . In this valley alone , the Fusiliers bagged 76 Mau Mau . The R.A.F. strafed and bombed the Mau Mau remnants as they fell back to their forests , and the British soon had them cornered on a wooded hill known as Blarney Castle . Mau Mau losses in the battle so far : 197 killed , including two " generals . " Total British loss : three wounded . <P> This was the biggest battle of Kenya 's emergency , and the British won it so completely because they had advance warning . " General China , ' ' the Mau Mau 's onetime No. 2 , who was captured by the British and sentenced to death ( TIME , Feb. 15 ) , is now cooperating with the British . Erskine hopes to use China to persuade other Mau Mau leaders to surrender . <P> " Damned Impertinence . " The skirmish was the one bright spot in an increasingly dark picture . The war against the Mau Mau gets worse , not better . A joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week that Kenya 's emergency is fast spreading , partly because the colonial government " has not yet secured the full support , loyalty and understanding of the majorities in all the racial communities . " <P> The delegation recommended that 1 ) Africans should be invited to join the government with full ministerial responsibilities ; 2 ) Africans should have access to the fertile lands , which are now mostly reserved for white settlers ; and 3 ) the color bar must go . The report was generally cheered in Britain , but in Kenya , many a hard-bitten settler called it " damned impertinence . " Complained one old colonial administrator : " You ca n't conduct war against murderers with kid gloves . "
