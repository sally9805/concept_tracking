The U.N . &; Mr. Lodge <P> Sir : <P> I sincerely congratulate you on the Aug. 11 article on the U.N . ' s Henry Cabot Lodge . During the last five years , I have witnessed the excellent work performed by Ambassador Lodge in defending the highest principles of international morals . His uprightness in opposing the sinister maneuvers of the representatives of the Soviet Union and its satellites and quasi-satellites deserves high praise from the free men of the world . <P> <P> EMILIO NUNEZ PORTUONDO Ambassador of Cuba to the U.N . New York City <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations ! TIME and Henry Koerner have accomplished what television and news photographers have failed in doing over the years . You 've taken a handsome man and made him look like a fat idiot . <P> <P> CARTER MULLALY JR . West Los Angeles <P> Sir : <P> Ambassador Lodge speaks a clear and muscular language that warms my heart every time he addresses the Russians . As one who has viewed all things Republican with a jaundiced eye , I think it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual toplofty , mush-mouthed types who use elliptical sentences that seem , lately , to be the voice of America . <P> Someone should consider Henry Cabot Lodge for the next Republican President . He might be prevailed upon to consider changing one thankless job for another . Furthermore , he just might win . <P> <P> WILLIAM C. DA VIE Rosedale , N.Y . <P> <P> The Pictures ' Story <P> Sir : <P> After looking at your Aug. 4 pictures of the Baghdad victims , I have decided to resign from the human race . <P> <P> ( MRS . ) ELLEN LOVETT , R.N. Seekonk , Mass . <P> <P> Sir : <P> For the second time I have found it necessary to tear a page out of TIME before taking it home . I wonder why any editor who is a human being could think of printing the " Victims of Baghdad " pictures . <P> <P> GERARD FAY London <P> Sir : <P> Thank you for publishing the pictures of the victims of the " bloodless " Iraqi revolt . <P> <P> At first I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't and should n't . <P> <P> JIMMY BAIRD Dallas <P> Sir : <P> When one reads of the inhuman and needless carnage of the Iraq revolt , one wonders if the teeming masses of the Arab countries are capable of , or indeed have a right to , self-determination . <P> <P> CHARLES R. GALE <P> Ann Arbor , Mich . <P> <P> Sir : <P> My most fervent hope is that the " Ike was stupid " crowd took a good look at the pictures . <P> <P> MRS . CHARLES G. STUVENGEN San Francisco <P> Escape to Reality <P> Sir : <P> I am one of the many , though silent , Americans who appreciated TV 's on-the-spot coverage of the U.N . ' s handling of the Middle East crisis Aug. 4 . Ordinarily , I would n't waste my time on the trash that litters the daytime TV screen , but I stayed glued to my set to watch U.N . representatives at work on a grave international problem . If the members of that " peace-loving audience " of popular programs truly cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would do well to pay less attention to the meaningless escapism of Dotto , Play Your Hunch and For Love or Money . <P> <P> ANN NORTON Beverly Hills , Calif . <P> <P> Sir :
