The Supreme Court decision in favor of CBS color ( TIME , June 4 ) did not mean that U.S. audiences would start seeing regular television shows in color right away . For one thing , not many set owners were likely to plunk down an estimated $125 for the necessary converters and adapters until they were assured of a full color schedule . For another , though CBS estimated that color receivers would be moving off U.S. assembly lines by September , most television manufacturers were either noncommittal on the subject or obviously dragging their feet . <P> Even CBS was making no large promises about its color schedule . It planned to get started by the end of June , but the CBS shows will be broadcast mostly during the early morning and late evening hours , so as not to interfere with CBS ' black &; white telecasts . What color programming there is will stick pretty closely to standard TV and , at first , will not exceed 20 hours a week . Advertisers who are curious to see how their products look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour ( for black &; white TV , CBS charges $3,250 an hour ) . <P> Although CBS had won the first battle , the campaign was far from over . RCA , whose rival , all-electronic color system lost to CBS before the FCC and in the courts , is still in there fighting . It released the design of its tri-color electronic tube to 231 TV manufacturers ( including CBS ) and plans public color demonstrations of its own system within a few weeks . And last week RCA joined with four other manufacturers ( General Electric , Philco , Du Mont , Hazeltine ) to announce successful laboratory tests of an even newer color system based , in part , on RCA 's defeated candidate .
