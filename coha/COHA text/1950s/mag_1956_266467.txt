Satellite in the Sky ( Warner ) is the sort of thing the British usually do very well done very badly . An attempt to duplicate the agonizing authenticity of such films as Breaking the Sound Barrier , it parades plot and props ( including an enormous mocked-up spaceship ) that could have been scissored by a small boy from the back of a cereal box . Its improbabilities do not begin or end with an unlikely character named Lefty who appears to pen notes with his right hand . <P> With less preparation than it takes to get a family of four off on a beach expedition , Her Majesty 's Government sets out to fire a rocketship past the pull of earth 's gravity , and at the same time touch off the world 's first T-1 bomb , which is too big to be exploded on earth . A girl reporter ( Lois Maxwell , about the only structurally sound object in Satellite ) stows away on the unguarded vessel . <P> Science-minded viewers will find much to object to : e.g. , in space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship , become weightless when they clamber outside to make repairs . <P> Otherwise , Satellite is rocketshipshape with searching dialogue ( " You knew the rocket was my job when you married me " ) , a crisis ( the bomb sticks to the ship 's hull ) , an addled scientist ( Donald Wolfit ) , and a final clinch between Reporter Maxwell and craggy-browed Pilot Kieron Moore . After 85 harrowing minutes Satellite makes port , leaving the corn barrier sadly shattered . <P> The Bad Seed ( Warner ) offers moviegoers a new sort of murderer : a crafty , coldblooded , eight-year-old blonde . Pig-tailed Patty McCormack has beautiful manners , a sweetly sensitive mother ( Nancy Kelly ) and a doting father ( William Hopper ) . But accidents happen to the people around her . There was the nice old lady who fell down a flight of stairs-and the little classmate who won a penmanship medal Patty wanted , and then was found mysteriously drowned at a school picnic . Patty was the last to see either of them alive . <P> Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penmanship medal hidden in Patty 's drawer , suspicion grows sharper , and she wrings a confession from Patty in a shattering crossexamination . Nor do the revelations come singly . Nancy has long had doubts about her paternity , and now her middle-class world collapses as she discovers that her own mother was a mass murderer who had fled justice . Even worse , she must face these mountainous horrors alone , since her husband has been called out of town . <P> While Nancy is bewilderingly facing up to the truth , little Patty is coolly taking the measure of another victim , a feebleminded janitor ( Henry Jones ) , who thinks he is teasing the child in blaming her for her classmate 's death . Probably the most chilling moment is when Jones discovers - too late-that his joking accusation is true . Before he can properly defend himself , Patty has burned him alive .
