Belgium 's most famous modern artist , Baron James Ensor , was 89 when he died last year . He had crammed his house with souvenirs that ranged from a cigar butt once left there by Belgium 's King Albert to a great painting done by Ensor himself 62 years ago : The Entry of Christ into Brussels . <P> The picture had so shocked his contemporaries that they refused to exhibit it even in avant-garde shows . Ensor resolved to enjoy his masterpiece himself , hung it in an upstairs room and admired it daily . Publicly shown for the first time in 1929 , it was hailed as a brilliant " expressionist " picture foreshadowing the works of Max Beckmann and Paul Klee . Connoisseurs clustered around the picture like cattle at a salt lick , but while he lived , Ensor refused to part with it . Last week it went for $40.000 to an Ostend casino proprietor named Gustave Nellens . <P> Dashingly , painted in bright colors , the huge Canvas swarms with festive Bruxellois , many in carnival costume . Almost lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted on a donkey . The quiet center of a scene as shrill and unsettling as an ambulance siren , He is one week from Golgotha.
