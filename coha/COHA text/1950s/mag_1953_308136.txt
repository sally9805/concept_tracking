The Emperor 's Clothes ( by George Tabori ) is theatrically an in- &-outer; and artistically a might-have-been . Playwright Tabori ( Flight Into Egypt ) has yoked a fascinating idea for a play to a good deal more familiar one , and the two neither run very well in harness nor altogether keep to the road . Tabori 's scene is Budapest in 1930 ; his atmosphere that of an incipient police state ; his chief characters a small boy ( Brandon de Wilde ) and his father ( Lee J. Cobb ) . The boy inhabits a mental world swarming with such heroes as Sherlock Holmes , Hoot Gibson and the Scarlet pimpernel . But his chief hero is his father , a schoolmaster who has been blacklisted for unorthodox opinions , and who has lost his backbone along with his job . <P> Suddenly the boy 's florid , noised-about fancies bring in the police . They arrest him , then bring him home , only to question and arrest his father . Before he goes off , the father disillusions his hero-worshiping son by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final curtain he is more his son 's hero than ever . <P> There could be a terrifying play in what the fantasies of a Tarkingtonian small boy could give rise to in a totalitarian society : the scene in The Emperor 's Clothes where two goons grill the father about Hoot Gibson 's war on " the cattle barons is a frightening reductio ad absurdum of police state methods . But what might have been a brilliantly sardonic social satire has first been squeezed inside a domestic framework and then dropped from the picture itself . Though the family story has its own realistic interest , it is never made real . Mixing and garnishing his moods at will , Tabori achieved vivid scenes but an unfocused play . The production and acting are uneven also , though in his best scenes Actor Cobb is brilliant . <P> The Emperor 's Clothes has a crashing finale , but what crashes is whatever is left of a serious play . The play takes its name from the Hans Christian Andersen tale in which a small boy is the only person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no clothes on . Tabori 's play has all too many clothes on , but there is not much underneath .
