" I Felt a Great Relief " // Les Staudacher of Bay City , Mich. is a mild-spoken Sunday school teacher and manufacturer of church pews whose sport is the raucous and risky one of racing jet speed boats . // Aiming to break the world water-speed record of 260.35 held by England 's Donald Campbell , Staudacher seemed near his goal on Nevada 's Pyramid Lake one day last week . Then , in a single luckless second , his Tempo- Alcoa ripped into a small peninsula jutting into the lake at Pelican Point . The boat took off like an airplane toward a ledge of rocks along shore . Staudacher 's story of what it was like : // " When I saw that rocky shore coming at me I said to myself , ' This is a heck of a way to end this thing . I just hope I hit hard enough to do a good job . ' I believed this was the end of my life . // " Then I did hit , and I was airborne . I felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peninsula , and that aerial view looked good to me . I knew I had n't hit too hard . My jet pilot 's helmet saved my head when I smashed into the windshield coming down . I 'll say one thing . The boat runs much better on water than it does on land . " // Staudacher 's flying jet ( its engine is from an airplane ) covered about 150 feet in the air , passing over the crest of Pelican Point and plowed down in loam and sand , skidding to the water 's edge on the other side . It missed by 18 inches hitting the shelf of rock . // Staudacher was uninjured . Later that day he drove the boat 's co-owner , Guy Lombardo , back to Reno in Lombardo 's car : Lombardo had skinned his knee in a fall while running down to the beach to see whether Staudacher had been injured . // Winner and System // It was just last week that our Emily Hahn ( in Britain 's Golden Pool ) was describing the Cinderella riches that arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same moment a modest punter from Yorkshire was breaking all existing records . // Arthur Webb , a 70-year-old retired printer of Scarborough , had looked forward to nothing more exciting than Christmas dinner with his family of 17 children and grandchildren when he made a one-shilling-sixpence bet . It earned him a nontaxable $742,904.40 . Like millions of his fellow Britons , Webb had played the pools regularly but with only a wistful dream that chance might favor his picks . // His system was not based on a deep or wide knowledge of either gambling or football . On the day he won , for reasons best known to himself , he decided to put his faith on teams whose names began with a C or an S and bet them ( as one must in the treble chance ) to tie their opponents . Accordingly he filled out nine lines on the card , at tuppence a line , expressing a hope rather than an opinion that Colchester would tie Swindon , Stirling Albion would tie Celtic , Sheffield United would tie Swansea and Cardiff would tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S system ) these four games were foolproof . What made Webb 's choice difficult was the fact that he had also to pick Charlton , Shrewsbury and Chester to tie teams that began with an L , a Q and an N. But , wonder of wonders , it happened . Webb 's choices were the only seven tie games on the card that week . // Arthur took his luck in characteristic calm . " At 70 , " he said , " I do n't really want all that money . But we 'll get a bigger house for sure . " // Afterthought Scratch one bowl game from your list . Officials of the Rice Bowl game , scheduled for Stuttgart , Ark. this week ( in conjunction with Stuttgart 's well-established duck-calling contest ) , called off football when they found that one invited team , Southeastern State of Durant , Okla. , had had an all-losing season instead of an all-winning season , as earlier and erroneously reported . // On the Road // Shortly after dawn breaks over Hancock Field in Syracuse , N.Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponderously upwind , lift its nose and head west for California . Aboard the airliner , scrubbed , combed and sanguine , will be 38 football players , 10 coaches , an athletic director and his assistant , a doctor , a dentist , trainers , managers and assorted supernumeraries . Some 10 ? hours later the plane will touch down in Los Angeles , and its passengers will walk down the unloading ramp , waving to photographers . The University of Syracuse football team , the nation 's only major college team still unbeaten and still untied , will have arrived to play the University of California at Los Angeles in its final game of the year . It will be Syracuse 's first visit to the coast in 35 years , and it will represent a good eight months of planning . // Phased with the precision of a minor military operation , which it almost is , the transcontinental trip is a logistical exercise first taken in hand last April by James Decker , assistant athletic director at Syracuse . In the execution of his duties , Decker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserved 36 rooms in Los Angeles ' Ambassador Hotel , engaged Greyhound buses to ferry the Syracuse contingent between airport and hotel . A man who has been shepherding Syracuse teams since 1947 , Decker forgot no details ( insofar as he could remember ) , even mailed approved football training menus to the Ambassador chef ( sample items : sirloin steak for breakfast before the game , ribs of beef for dinner afterward ) . // Responsibilities bearing more directly on the game itself are those of Head Coach Ben Schwartzwalder . Proved or otherwise , the notion persists that any college football team lured in late fall from the harshness of the East to the bland climate and pastel distractions of the West is a setup for an upset . To minimize the chances ( and UCLA was the first to upset Southern California ) , Schwartzwalder 's pregame schedule leaves little freedom for sightseeing and socializing ; at an alumni reception in the Ambassador Friday night , for example , the team will be introduced with discreet brevity and then shuffled off to bed . Other times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the instructions they have been hearing all week from their coaches . // Moreover , they will be expected to glance occasionally at a mimeographed fact sheet handed to them before their departure from Syracuse by Assistant Athletic Director Decker . On all game trips Decker prepares schedule sheets and appends at the bottom some inspiring words from military history . In the past he has selected such exhortations as Admiral William Halsey 's " Hit hard , hit fast , hit often , " West Point 's No. 1 axiom " Never underestimate the enemy " and Churchill 's " You ask what is our aim ? I can answer in one word : victory ! " // For this week 's western expedition Decker has turned to Ulysses S. Grant 's western campaign in the Civil War . If partisans of the UCLA cause on Saturday are in any doubt about the serious dispatch Grant sent to the Confederates ' General Simon Bolivar Buckner in besieged Fort Donelson  --  or the spirit with which Syracuse is dispatching the Syracusans this time  --  here 's the message : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I propose to move immediately upon your works . " // Analysis at Penn // The six-foot psychologist will never replace the seven-foot center , but Jack McCloskey , who coaches the University of Pennsylvania basketball team , does n't have a seven-foot center  --  he does have the six-foot psychologist . Last year McCloskey 's Quakers won 12 games while losing 14 . This year all five of his starters graduated and his tallest man is a mere 6 foot 4 . Then Dr. Howard Mitchell suited up , psychologically speaking . Dr. Mitchell is with the Department of Psychiatry at Penn 's medical school and played basketball ( and football ) at Boston University . // Dr. Mitchell is something of an iconoclast . " It 's poppycock that sports mold character , " he says . " Character is molded in the family setting and in early influences . " McCloskey is something of an iconoclast too . " I do n't believe in pep talks , " he says . " When you 're playing a big game or a highly rated opponent , you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along fine if their iconoclasms do n't clash . Happily , they do n't at Penn . Dr. Mitchell 's job is to administer personality tests to the basketball team . McCloskey 's job is to use the results of the tests to aid him in getting the most out of his players . " Some kids need praise from their teammates more than from me , " McCloskey explains . " Some kids can be chewed out during practice in front of the squad . For others it 's better to take them aside and talk to them individually . " // " Sports , " says Dr. Mitchell , " provide the best statistics on production of any unit of behavior . For example , we make studies of how marital conflict affects a man 's productivity , but there are so many other factors . It 's not the same as taking the percentage of shots a player hits . " // Basically , the tests are designed to measure a correlation between the physiological readiness of a player and his mental readiness  --  to determine if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " up " physically . // One test requires the basketball player to rate his performance during the week  --  how much skill he showed , how much of a contribution he made to the team effort , how fatigued he was . McCloskey , meanwhile , makes his own appraisals. // " You need basic personality information to account for the disparities that show up , " says Dr. Mitchell . // Another test is team dart throwing . The players record their scores and then the scores they expect to make the next time  --  what Dr. Mitchell calls " an aspiration level . " Then they record the score for their team and the score they expect their team to make the next time . // Some players score low but have great expectations as to how their team will score . " This is the sort of fellow who will put more dependence on the performance of others and not expect much of himself , " says Dr. Mitchell . " We can look at his personality index , and he will show up as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they set goals beyond their fulfillment. " // A profile chart is drawn up on each player listing 252 dimensions of personality under such large headings as conformity , aggression and dependence . One trait , for instance , is liability of affect and restlessness . " A boy showing strongly here , " says Dr. Mitchell , " is the boy to exhibit for the team 's good when he is on the upswing . It 's no good to put him in when he 's down in the dumps in an effort to shake him out of them . As for a strong superego , this sort of fellow may be an itch personally , but this trait can be helpful . He 's the sort who will shrug off an injury to play . He wants to get back in. // " The information can help guide the instructional process . There may be one boy the coach must tell something to 20 times while the rest of the squad needs only seven or eight times . This boy may show high on negativism . He may still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . " // McCloskey , fighting for a winning season , admits that the tests have revealed little he did n't already suspect . " But they 've shown that we were right in our estimates of the kids , " he says . " If they had turned up differences , then I 'd have been worried . " Not that he is n't , in a larger sense . Asked to name Penn 's chief asset , McCloskey said : " Prayer . " // Blue-water Stock // If you have n't seen your broker lately you may have missed a new corporation that has just arrived on the **25;149;TOOLONG front . It is Treasure Hunters Inc. of Washington , D.C. , and its prospectus affirms that it will " engage in the search for sunken cargoes and buried treasures throughout the world . " On September 28 , when its registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission became effective , Treasure Hunters offered 1,900,000 shares to the public at $1 each , with 20 shares the minimum order accepted . And just to insure that everyone recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no person should invest in this enterprise any more than he can afford to lose . " Thus far , no sportsmen have been injured in the rush to buy . // Daniel Stack of Brooklyn , the 31-year-old attorney who is president of Treasure Hunters Inc. , cheerfully admitted the other day that he has had a blue-water urge for a long time : " Ever since I was a boy I 've read about the millions in gold doubloons and silver pieces of eight that lie on the bottom . I even took Spanish so I could do original research , but had to give it up when I found I was probably the worst language student Brooklyn College ever had . I tried for a Navy commission seven years in a row and was rejected every time for being underweight . The eighth time I drank nine pounds of water and was sick for three days , but I got my ensign 's stripe . Then , just about 1953 , when I expected destroyer duty , I was given a desk job in Supply instead . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I began to get the people together who are presently officers in our organization . Now that I 'm out of the Navy and the company is formalized , I feel I 'm on the threshold of a dream . " // Dream or not , Treasure Hunters Inc. has talented direction . Its chairman of the board is Commodore Robert E. Robinson Jr . ( Ret. ) , an Annapolis man who was chief of staff of the North Pacific Command during World War II . Company officers include Cloyd M. Smith , an engineering consultant to the U.S. government and private industry ; Edward Bunnell , a ship designer and diver who once held the world 's simulated depth-pressure record ; Captain Ernest G. Vetter ( USNR ) , commander of the Navy Flight Instructor School at Purdue during World War II ; and Robert I. Nesmith , an internationally recognized authority on Spanish coins and pirate treasure . // " With experts like these , " said Stack , " and with the nearly $2 million we hope to raise , we should be able to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sufficient money and equipment to find treasure ; you also need accurate research , a well-trained crew , adequate time and a respected reputation . " // One of Treasure Hunters ' first ventures aims at bringing up a part of the richest of all sunken treasures , that in Spain 's mud-covered Vigo Bay . It was there , in 1702 , that 23 Spanish galleons , stuffed with gold and silver estimated at $115 million , were cornered and plundered by a fleet of English and Dutch warships . Among those that were lost was one that struck a submerged rock and sank in almost 300 feet off the mouth of the bay , laden with at least $2 million in bullion . Company divers , working under permits from the Spanish government , are currently searching for this wreck on Vigo 's bottom ; if and when the location is pinpointed Treasure Hunters ' salvage experts will move in. // " We were worried , " said Stack , " about how we could show our stockholders what we 're doing . We think we 've solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw lots to see which one will go along on future exploratory voyages , and the one who goes can report to the others on his findings . Since one-quarter of any prize money goes to the officers of the company and the crew , the stockholder would also get a share . " // This part of the offer , Stack explained , is open only to male stockholders . No women will be allowed on the company 's voyages : too many complications . " I might add , " Stack said , " that this particular rule makes my wife furious . " // The Men and the Boys // Five athletes from foreign countries loped across the finish line in the National Collegiate cross-country championships last week as clearly ahead of the U.S.-born entries as so many Russians in a space race . And to hear the wails of anguish that arose , one might have thought they were the Russians . " It just is n't fair , " said the coach from one college on the east coast . " I bring my youngsters out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who should have quit school five , six , or even 10 years ago . " // His complaint , like that of the other beaten coaches , was that three of the foreigners , all of whom were legitimately enrolled at U.S. colleges , were older than the average U.S. student athlete . Al Lawrence , who won for the University of Houston , is a 29-year-old Australian . John Macy is a 29-year-old refugee from Poland and a veteran of the Polish army . Crawford Kennedy , from Scotland via Canada , is 24. // Each of these runners is undeniably a grown man and each is an immigrant from parts of the world where amateur running is a grown man 's sport , conducted far more in athletic associations than colleges . As such they may well enjoy an initial advantage over collegians in the U.S. But as another foreigner once said , " a man 's a man for a ' that . " A male adult of college age is supposed to be a man . He is being trained and educated to compete with men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // " I felt like going up to those fellas , " said one bested young runner from Brown University , " and saying ' nice run , but I 'll bet I can do better nine years from now . ' " // Maybe you can , boy , but not if the NCAA makes it easy for you by ruling out the grown-ups as some of the coaches last week were urging . That seems to us about as childish as trying to win the space race by disqualifying Russian scientists . // Present Accounted For // At the end of a losing season They presented the coach with a car , In which , and they had good reason , They said that they hoped he 'd go far .  --  RICHARD ARMOUR
