The Soft Voice of the Serpent H E WAS only twenty-six and very healthy and he was soon strong enough to he wheeled out into the garden . Like everyone else , he had great and curious faith in the garden : " Well , soon you 'll be tip and able to sit out in the garden , " they said , looking at him fervently , with little understanding tilts of the head . Yes , he would be out ... in the garden . It was a big garden enclosed in old , dark , sleek , pungent firs , and he could sit deep beneath their tiered fringes , down in the shade , far away . There was the feeling that there , in the garden , he would come to an understanding ; that it would come easier , there . Perhaps there was something in this of the old Eden idea ; the tender human adjusting himself to himself in the soothing impersonal presence of trees and grass and earth , before going out into the stare of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife was wheeling him along the gravel path in the sun and the shade , and he felt exactly as he did when he was a little boy and he used to bend and hang , looking at the world upside down , through his ankles . Everything was vast and open , the sky , the wind blowing along through the swaying , trembling greens , the flowers shaking in vehement denial . Movement . . . A first slight wind lifted again in the slack , furled sail of himself ; he felt it belly gently , so gently he could just feel it , lifting inside him . So she wheeled him along , pushing hard and not particularly well with her thin pretty arms  --  but he would not for anything complain of the way she did it or suggest that the nurse might do better , for he knew that would hurt her  --  and when they came to a spot that he liked , she put the brake on the chair and settled him there for the morning . That had been the first time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , but his attention was arrested sometimes , quite suddenly and compellingly , by the sunken place under the rug where his leg used to be . There was his one leg , and next to it , the rug flapped loose . Then looking , he felt his leg not there ; he felt it go , slowly , From the toe to the thigh . He felt that he had no leg . After a few minutes he went back to his book . He never let the realization quite reach him ; he let himself realize it physically , but he never quite let it get at him . He felt it pressing up , coming , coming , dark , crushing , ready to burst  --  but he always turned away , just in time , back to his book . That was his system ; that was the way he was going to do it . He would let it come near , irresistibly near , again and again , ready to catch him alone in the garden . And again and again he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become a habit , with the reassuring strength of a habit . It would become such a habit never to get to the point of realizing it , that he never would realize it . And one day he would find that he had achieved what he wanted : he would feel as if he had always been like that . Then the danger would be over , forever , I N A week or two he did not have to read all the time ; he could let himself put down the book and look about him , watching the firs part silkily as a child 's Erie straight hair in the wind , watching the small birds tightroping the telephone wire , watching the fat old dove trotting after his refined patrician gray women , purring with lust . His wife came and sat beside him , doing her sewing , and sometimes they spoke , but often theysat for hours , a whole morning , her movements at work small and unobtrusive as the birds ' , he resting his head back and looking at a blur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , habitually looking inward , would catch the signal of some little happening , some point of color in the garden , and her laugh or exclamation drawing his attention to it would suddenly clear away the silence . At eleven o'clock she would get up and put down her sewing and go into the house to fetch their tea ; crunching slowly away into the sun up the path , going easily , empowered by the sun rather than her own muscles . He watched her go , easily . .. . He was healing . In the static quality of his gaze , in the relaxed feeling of his mouth , in the upward-lying palm of his hand , there was annealrnent . One day a big locust whirred dryly past her head , and she jumped up with a cry , scattering her sewing things . He laughed at her as she bent about picking them up , shuddering . She went into the house to fetch the tea , and he began to read . But presently he put down the book and , yawning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed , lying in a rosc bed . He smiled , remembering her . And then lie became conscious of a curious old-mannish little face , fixed upon him in a kind of hypnotic dread . There , absolutely stilled with fear beneath his glance , crouched a very big locust . What an amusing face the thing had ! A lugubrious long face , that somehow suggested a bald head , and such a glum mouth . It looked like some little person out of a Disney cartoon . It moved slightly , still looking up fearfully at him . Strange body , encased in a sort of old-fashioned creaky armor . He had never realized before what ridiculous-looking insects locusts were ! Well , naturally not ; they occur to one collectively , as a pest  --  one does n't go around looking at their faces . The face was certainly curiously human and even expressive , but looking at the body , he decided that the body could n't really be called a body at all . With the face , the creature 's kinship with humans ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matchstick , like a small boy 's homemade airplane . And those could not be thought of as legs  --  the great saw-toothed back ones were like the parts of an old crane , and the front ones like  --  like one of her hairpins , bent in two . At that moment the creature slowly lifted up one of the front legs , and passed it tremblingly over its head , stroking the left antenna down . Just as a man might take out a handkerchief and pass it over his brow . He began to feel enormously interested in the creature , and leaned over in his chair to see it more closely . It sensed him and beneath its stiff , plated sides , he was surprised to see the pulsations of a heart . How fast it was breathing . . . . He leaned away a little , to frighten it less . Watching it carefully , and trying to keep himself effaced from its consciousness by not moving , he became aware of some struggle going on in the thing . It seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then passed along its body in a kind of petering tremor , and ended in a stirring along the upward shaft of the great back legs . But the locust remained where it was . Several times this wave of effort cur-rented through it and was spent . but the next time it ended surprisingly in a few hobbling , uneven steps , its undercarriage  --  airplanelike again  --  trailing along the earth . Then the creature lay , Fallen on its antennae turned stretched out toward Lim . It groped with its hands , feeling for a hold on the soft ground , bending its elbows and straining . With a heave , it righted itself , and as it did so , he saw  --  leaning forward again  --  what was the trouble . It was the same trouble . His own trouble . The creature had lost one leg . Only the long upward shaft of its left leg remained , with a neat round aperture where , no doubt , the other half of the leg had been jointed in. ow as he watched the locust gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spend itself again and again in a message that was so puzzlingly never obeyed , he knew exactly what the creature felt . OE course he knew that feeling ! That absolute certainty that the leg was there : one had only to lift it . . The upward shaft of the locust 's leg quivered , lifted ; why then could n't he walk ? He tried again . The message came ; it was going through , the leg was lifting , now it was ready  --  now ! ... The shaft sagged in the air , with nothing , nothing to hold it up . He laughed and shook his head . He knew .. . Good Lord , exactly like  --  he called out to the house ? " Come quickly ! Come and see ! You 've got another patient ! " " What ? " she shouted . " I 'm getting tea . " " Come and look ! " he called " Now ! " . What is it ? " she said , approaching the locust distastefully . " Your locust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little shriek . " Do n't worry  --  it ca n't move . It 's as harmless as I am . You must have knocked its leg off when you hit out at it ! " He was laughing at her . " Oh , I did n't ! " she said reproachfully . She loathed it but she loathed to hurt , even more . " I never even touched it ! All I hit was air . . . . I could n't possibly have hit it . Not its leg off . " " All right then . It 's another locust . But it 's lost its leg , anyway . You should just see it . It does n't know the leg is n't there . God , I know exactly how that feels . . . . I 've been watching it , and honestly , it 's uncanny . I can see it feels just as I do ! " She smiled at him , sideways ; she seemed suddenly pleased at something . Then , recalling herself , she came forward , bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it ca n't move , " she said , hang-ing over it . " Do n't be frightened , " he laughed . " Touch it . " " Ah , the poor thing , " she said , catching her breath in-compassion . " It ca n't Walk . " " Do n't encourage it to self-pity , " he teased her . She looked up and laughed . " Oh you ? " she parried , assuming a frown . The locust kept its solemn silly face turned to her . " Shame , is n't he a funny old man , " she said . " But what will happen to him ? " " I do n't know , " he said , for being in the same boat absolved him from responsibility or pity . " Maybe he 'll grow another one . Lizards grow new tails , if they lose them . " " Oh lizards , " she said . " But not these . I 'm afraid the cat 'll get him . " " Get another little chair made for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , " she laughed . " Only for him it would have to be a kind of little cart , with wheels . " " Or maybe he could be taught to use crutches . I 'm sure the farmers would like to know that the fellow was being kept active . " " The poor old thing , " she said , bending over the locust again . And reaching back somewhere into an inquisitive childhood she picked up a thin wand of twig and prodded the locust , very gently . " Funny thing is , it 's even the same leg , the left one . " She looked round at him and smiled . " I know , " he nodded , laughing . " The two of us . . . " And then he shook his head and , smiling , said it again : " The two of us . " S HE was laughing and just then she flicked the twig more sharply than she meant to and at the touch of it there was a sudden flurried papery whirr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the stick in her hand , half afraid of it again , and appealed , unnerved as a child , " What happened ? What happened ? " There was a moment of silence . " Do n't be a fool , " he said irritably . They had forgotten that locusts can fly .
