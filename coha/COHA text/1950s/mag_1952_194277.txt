Many of you have written to ask why TIME has on occasion " honored " the enemies of the U.S. by placing them on the cover . The answer : TIME 'S covers reflect the news , and Communism has certainly been in the news . When a Communist appears on the cover of TIME , he is placed in the spotlight the better to be scrutinized . <P> When Georgy Malenkov made TIME 'S cover two weeks ago , for example , it was the 41st time that a Russian Communist had been there . In addition , there have also been two Chinese , three U.S. , one Mexican and seven other European Communists on the cover of TIME. * <P> Pictured above is a gallery of dictators and their deputies , all of whom have gone to their deaths since appearing on the cover of TIME . Below is another set , most of them still alive , some of whom might again appear on the cover . <P> TIME recognized the importance of Russia in the news when it first started publication . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover ( TIME , July 14 , 1924 ) . Said the story : " When Kerensky was overthrown , Rykov and his time-proved friend Lenin went on hand in hand , for better or for worse , in pursuit of the aims of Communism . " <P> Next to appear on the cover was Leon Trotsky , on the occasion of his return to Moscow from the Caucasus , presumably to be restored to a position of power ( TIME , May 18 , 1925 ) . " The Russian sky is very large , " the story began , " and under it some of the queerest things in history have happened . " Describing Trotsky 's earlier career as commander in chief of the Red army , it said : " Always was he on the move . His discipline made that of the Czars a sort of mother 's love and it was said that every officer and soldier went in terror of his life . " <P> The first time that Stalin was mentioned prominently in a cover story was when Trotsky made the cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalin , said TIME , " is distinguished by a well-shaped head surrounded by a shock of black hair , just beginning to grey . He has a silky black mustache . His eyes are black , and rarely is there a gleam of merriment in them . His facial features suggest cruelty-a hard mask of oriental ruthlessness . He is a silent man , not given to speechifying ; and behind his mask lies a singular determination . " <P> Stalin himself made his first appearance on the cover on June 9 , 1930 , has reappeared eight times since ( most recently as the background for Malenkov ) . No other Communist has approached that record . Runners-up are Molotov and Trotsky , with three each . But Malenkov , who has now been on TIME 'S cover twice , may better their records in due course . <P> Said the first Stalin cover story : " If peace is menaced by Benito Mussolini , at least , like an honest rattlesnake , he jangles his sword . Stalin acts without warning ... Exactly where Stalin stands on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said last year in an address to the American section of the Third International . <P> " ' I consider that the Communist Party of the U.S.A. is one of the few Communist Parties to which history has confided decisive tasks from the viewpoint of the world revolutionary movement . The revolutionary crisis ... in the United States ... is near . . . The American Communist Party must be ready to meet the crisis fully armed to take over the direction of the future class war .
