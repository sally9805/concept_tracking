Leaders of the British Labor Party assembled as somberly as admirals summoned for a gold-braid court-martial . The time had come at last to deal with Aneurin Bevan , the vat-dyed black sheep , the unregenerate guerrilla of British Socialism . " He 's had it this time , " said one leader grimly . " Only a miracle of the fishes could save him . " <P> Behind closed doors , the 18 members of the party 's " shadow cabinet " considered not whether to punish Nye Bevan , but how . By questioning and taunting Party Chief Clement Attlee on the floor of the House of Commons during the defense debate ( TIME , March 14 ) , the rambunctious Welshman had handed his opponents an opportunity . They did not question Bevan 's refusal to vote with the party in censuring the Tory government 's defense plans , for 62 other Laborites , many of them pacifists , had abstained also . <P> But Nye Bevan alone had publicly taunted Attlee on Labor 's willingness to use the H-bomb . Of course , Nye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ( exception : when he was expelled from the party for eight months in 1939 , together with the late Sir Stafford Cripps , for seeking a " united front " with the British Communists ) . But now patience was exhausted . " He is his own worst enemy , " admitted Bevan 's camp follower , Dick Grossman , unwilling this time to go along with the boss . " This is the moment for a complete surgical operation , " said one right-wing Laborite . " There 's no longer room for those who want the luxury of having it both ways-it 's Clem or Nye , straight choice and no shenanigan . " <P> Followers in the Streets . The Labor Party 's trouble , observed the Manchester Guardian , is that it has " a leader who does not lead and a follower who does not follow . " When it came time to operate , the Labor leadership 's hand began to shake a little . It was not easy to pare down the clever and glamorous rebel from the coal fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor leaders with his wild speeches on foreign policy and scares away perhaps 1,000,000 middle-of-the-road Britons who might otherwise tend toward Labor , Bevan has a rebel 's popularity in the streets , shops and mines of Britain . For two hours the leaders debated what to do . <P> Bevanite Harold Wilson wanted only to administer a simple reprimand for bad parliamentary behavior . Labor 's " keep calm " moderates were for formally censuring Nye , but not for expelling him : to do so during an election year would be to court defeat . Clem Attlee himself leaned to the moderates ' view . Attlee 's usual response to Nye Bevan 's bull-like forays into vital issues-e.g. , Formosa , negotiations with Russia , gibing at the U.S.-is to adopt as much of the Bevanite position as he can , and thereby undercut the Bevanites ' appeal . It has led him up some strange alleys . <P> This time Labor 's right wing had fire in its eyes . Chief among the determined were aging ( 67 ) , Cockney-born Herbert Morrison , deputy leader and presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the relatively young ( 48 ) and clever former economics professor who was Labor 's last Chancellor of the Exchequer and aspires to be something higher . Troublemaker Bevan must go , they argued , for the good of the party .
