When its shiny new DC-8 takes off on its maiden test flight this week , Douglas will launch a major challenger to Boeing 's already-tested 707 in the jet airliner race . To sell such new airliners , U.S. aircraft manufacturers are adopting an old-fashioned marketing technique : the trade-in allowance . Boeing has agreed to take back 14 propeller-driven Stratocruisers when it delivers its 707s to British Overseas Airways Corp. , has offered to give trade-in allowances on nine more 707s to Northwest Airlines . Douglas is negotiating with United Air Lines to take in some DC-7s as a down payment on 30 DC-8s ; Lockheed is dickering in the same way to sell its turboprop Electras . All told , U.S. airlines have ordered 257 jets and 172 turboprops . When these come into service , their extra speed and capacity will send about 700 piston aircraft onto the used-plane market . <P> No jetmaker is happy about getting into the secondhand plane business , because that market is already poor . As recently as 18 months ago , demand was so strong that fully depreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ancient DC-3s were bringing $140,000 v. an original cost of $85,000 . But with turboprops and jets on the way , airlines lost interest in slower aircraft , and prices tumbled 40% to 60% . American Airlines , which has four DC-7s currently for sale and may have up to 25 more by July 1959 , is asking $1,200,000 for an aircraft that cost $2,000,000 new . A DC-6B that cost $1,300,000 might have a trade-in value of $750,000 , but would fetch far less in the open market . <P> At the moment , none of the planemakers is sure of customers for the piston aircraft , though there are 1,100 DC-3s and DC-4s around the world that will soon have to be replaced . Even without the assurance of a market , the planemakers will take trade-ins because , according to one . " a trade-in may be just enough to tip a deal your way . " <P> One possibility considered by planemakers : subsidiaries that would sell , lease and re-equip the planes . Some foreign lines that have ordered jets as a matter of prestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle for DC-7s and Constellations.
