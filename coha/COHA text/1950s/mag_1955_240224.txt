A onetime Hollywood queen and longtime friend and helpmate of Newspaper Tycoon William Randolph Hearst last week talked about her " current consuming interest " : real estate . Said Marion Davies , now fiftyish : " Land is the most important thing in the world because it 's God-given , and should be developed . " <P> Her most recent action proving her words is the purchase of Palm Springs ' $2,000,000 Desert Inn ( TIME , July 25 ) . She believes that " Palm Springs is growing like Florida grew , is ripe for ... development , " expects to build " a miniature Rockefeller Center " around the inn that will include small department stores , a theater , possibly a nightclub . <P> Financial Advice . A liking for revenue-producing land is nothing new with Marion ( says she of jewelry : " All you do is pay insurance " ) . She remembers her first purchase : around 1936 , " I was walking down Park Avenue with Arthur Brisbane onetime Hearst editor and partner-in-real-estate with his chief , and he pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marion , you should buy that ; it will bring you $500,000 a year . ' " The advice prompted Marion to start buying real estate , with funds from her Cosmopolitan Productions , the company that Hearst had set up to make her films . <P> Her reasons for buying were not always dictated by potential profits . " I went on a house-buying spree one day , bought about eight houses in one day . I do n't know why I did it ; I did n't like most of them . " But she liked the comparatively small , 27-room house in Beverly Hills that she now lives in . Says she : " It 's quiet and cool , and ' W.R. ' liked this house . It reminded him in a small way of San Simeon . " <P> Riding the Boom . Soon after Hearst died ( TIME , Aug. 20 , 1951 ) , Marion took notice of the postwar building boom , decided that the time had come to develop her holdings . She hired the law firm of Bautzer , Grant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **26;17727;TOOLONG Gregson Bautzer and Manhattan Lawyer Arnold Grant . " I do what they tell me , " says Marion . " Greg has a great mind for real estate . He 's smarter than I am . " <P> Shrewdly advised by Grant and Bautzer , she tore down some old brownstones at 57th Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan that were bringing her $8,000 a year , got the Tishman Realty &; Construction Co. to put up and lease the 22-story , aluminum-sheathed Davies Building . It pays her about $120,000 a year . Down came a block of flats on her property at 55th Street and Madison Avenue , and now abuilding is the 17-story Douras Building , named for her father , onetime Manhattan Judge Barney Douras , which will bring her about $50,000 a year . By improving property she owns on 57th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues , she added still more to her revenues , bought control of Fifth Avenue 's Squibb Building . Still to come are improvement of two pieces of property in Los Angeles near the " Miracle Mile " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hills and Santa Monica . <P> Marion appreciates the talents of her lawyers , whose guidance has helped her earn an estimated annual net income of $400,000 a year from real estate . But they also respect her business instincts . Says Bautzer : " She has a good sense of smell about a piece of land . ' '
