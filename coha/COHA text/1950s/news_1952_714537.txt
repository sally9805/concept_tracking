txt Secretary of the Army Frank Pace Jr . acknowledged last night a growing lack of confidence in the Federal Government and suggested , as one remedy , the formation of a nation-wide citizens " watch dog " committee . He proposed that such a group act as a " kind of continuing Hoover Commission , " set forth facts clearly , objectively and fearlessly on matters of major importance ; keep the people better informed about the character and operation of the Government , and serve to encourage able men to enter public service . Mr. Pace made the proposals in an Address at a dinner at which General of the Army George C. Marshall received the Four Freedoms Award from the Four Freedoms Foundation , Inc . The award is made annually to the person who has rendered the most distinguished service in the field of the four freedoms as enunciated by the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt . General Marshall received a plaque bearing a citation hailing him for his " outstanding service as a soldier , statesman and diplomat in the cause of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Marshall Voices Gratitude General Marshall , in accepting the award , said it constituted " a tribute any man would tremendously value , and I am truly very grateful . " Other speakers at the dinner , held in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , included Secretary of Labor Maurice Tobin ; Brig . Gen. Carlos P. Romulo , Philippine Ambassador to the United States , and Emil K. Ellis , chairman of the board of the foundation . Ferdinand Pecora , former New York Supreme Court Justice , presided . Mr. Pecora succeeded the late Robert P. Patterson as co-chairman of the dinner . Mr. Patterson , the former Secretary of War , was killed in a plane crash on Jan. 22 . A letter was read from Presi- dent Truman in which he said : " Soldier , statesman and diplomat , General Marshall in peace no less than in war has rendered high service to his country wherever duty called . When he finished his tour of duty as wartime Chief of Staff of the Army he was not only the outstanding soldier of World War II but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' at the head of the great commanders of history . ' " It is fitting also that'he should receive through all of his days the plaudits of the nation he served so heroically and with such selfless devotion . Again I quote the language of an official citation : ' To , him , as much as to any indi-I vidual , the United States owed its ' future . ' " Mr. Truman also paid tribute to Mr. Patterson , one of the founders of the Four Freedoms Foundation . He said that in Mr. Patterson 's death the nation had " lost a patriot who rendered valiant service as a civilian in cooperation with General Marshall . " A brief address by Mrs. Patterson was followed by a silent tribute to the memory of her husband . Secretary Pace declared the loss of confidence in the Government resulted partly from the " attacks against the very institutions of our Government " that were basically sound . He said there was a feeling of doubt the United State* could measure up to her responsibilities . An impartial assessment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 116 said , but would " give the people mor4 confidence in them . " Outlining his proposed " watch dog " group , which he said should be composed of citizens of the " highest level , " the Secretary said its head should " combine the best qualities of /executive experience " and that " its staff should be the ablest . " " Its board of directors , " he added , " should come from the foremost leaders of all segments of ' American life and should be independent of the executive and legislative branches of the Government . " Mr. Pace suggested that , like the Hoover Commission , the proposed group should " strengthen internal government organization through constructive criticism of the fabric and operation of our ! institutions . " " It would constantly examine government from both the close and long range views , " he said . The Secretary warmly praised ( President Truman for his " vigoroils support " of both the Marshall Plan and the Point Four Program , calling the two the " key arches in our post-World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national production is expanding , " he said . " The heavy armament burden we have to carry can be absorbed without cutting too drastically into our standard of living . The aid we extend our allies under the Mutual Security Program is only a fraction'of our annual increase in production . " There are those who urge that we restrict this enormously creative talent of ours . I suggest that they should read Christ 's Parable of the Talents to learn the fate of the man -- or nation  --  which buries its talents . There could be no quicker way to national decline . " Ambassador Romulsepraised the Marshall Plan for having provided a solid foundation for the security structure in Western Europe . International communism , he. , said , has produced nothing to match , " this inspiring spectacle of the mightiest nation on earth unselfishly expending so much of its substance to help other nations to remain free . " Secretary Tobin said ; , ' We must make sure that America remains a safe place ? for unpopular as well as popular ideas . " He declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " in addition to the legal aspects , even more important is the spirit of the individual in any moral approach to freedom of speech . "
