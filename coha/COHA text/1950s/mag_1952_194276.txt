Texas &; Shivers <P> Sir : <P> Your Sept. 29 article on Texas followed the same hackneyed approach that you always take toward my native state-oil wells , millionaires , the Cullen Foundation , and the Republic National Bank ... In the traditional TIME manner your article slides over the surface of Texas politics and finds the tidelands the supreme issue . Certainly the word " tidelands " has been passed about by the politicians , but it is safe to say that half to three-fourths of the people of the state do not know what the controversy is about . . . <P> In spite of H. R. Cullen and Jesse Jones , Texas is essentially a poor state and backward in many respects . . . The vast majority of our people , the low-income group , are not opposed to New Deal measures other than the attempts to promote racial equality . They have benefited greatly from the Democratic programs , and will probably stay with the party if it promises to continue these programs . The ultra-conservatives are really not typical of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISAAC <P> Searcy , Ark . <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . TIME errs in calling the tidelands issue only a matter of principle . There will be plenty of money involved too . Royalties and fees from leasing state-owned land in Texas go to pay for the education of Texas schoolchildren . Lured by the economic opportunity mentioned in your article , many aggressive young couples have moved to <P> Texas from other states . This influx of young couples and their children , plus the population growth encountered with an expanding economy , is creating an acute shortage of school buildings and teachers . . . Any Texan who values the welfare of his children should vote for Dwight Eisenhower . <P> <P> WILLIAM P. HARVEY <P> Wichita Falls , Texas <P> Sir : <P> This fight in Texas is separating the men from the boys . Governor Shivers , with his million-dollar farms and all , is proving to be just an office boy for the oil cartel and the big rich . The men , like Sam Rayburn and Wright Patman , are standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JONES <P> Corpus Christi , Texas <P> Sir : <P> . . . Some day I hope to see Allan Shivers as President of the United States . . . <P> <P> RONALD J. BYERS <P> Austin , Texas <P> Sir : <P> Hallelujah ! It 's about time TIME did something about that stupid Texas myth . <P> . . . Every Texan is a walking Chamber of Commerce , and there is absolutely nothing to boast about . <P> I have found them unoriginal people , and that the great fortunes they have are either made by Northerners who have brought their money to Texas , or have inherited it from Northern sources . <P> I sometimes have the feeling that if you took all means of communication out of Texas the people would n't miss it one bit . They are that wrapped up in themselves . . . <P> <P> ARLENE SHAPIRO <P> Austin , Texas <P> Texas v. Ferber <P> Sir : <P> Re Edna Ferber 's Giant Sept. 29 : this lady is about as well qualified to write authoritatively on the state of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages on the political and social situation , historic background , etc. of Cuba , where last winter I spent 44 days . The last time I saw a Texas " steak topped by a couple of eggs " was in August 1916 , at Presidio when doing Mexican Border service with the and Texas Infantry . . . <P> <P> WILLIAM FIELDS
