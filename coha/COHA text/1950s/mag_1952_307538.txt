Filming the life story of French Painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec ( 1864-1901 ) posed a serious make-up problem for Director John Huston and Actor Jos Ferrer . Toulouse-Lautrec was a dwarf who stood 4 ft. 8 in. , and Ferrer , who plays the part , is 5 ft. 11 . The solution : Ferrer plays the part on his knees . Last week as the film , Moulin Rouge , neared completion in London , Ferrer showed photographers the " torture boots " that enable him to walk like a dwarf . Few movie stars since the days of Lon Chancy have submitted to such complicated and elaborately painful makeup . <P> Each boot is a leather " saddle " which supports Ferrer 's thigh , knee and upper leg when his knees are bent . The boots themselves are supported by a canvas shoulder harness , which pulls the calves of both legs tightly against his thighs . Fitted to the bottom of the knees are fake shoes . Obviously , only camera angles which do not show Ferrer 's real feet ( i.e. , front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots are tight and painful-pressure on his kneecaps cuts off blood circulation-Ferrer wears them for only 20 minutes at a time , keeps a doctor standing by just in case .
