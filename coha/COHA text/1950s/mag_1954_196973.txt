When Melvin Eugene Hewitt got into a brawl outside a Long Beach ( Calif. ) bar 2 years ago , nothing was further from his mind than a contribution to medical research . But in his misfortune he made one . After he banged his head on a car and hit the sidewalk , Hewitt 's heart stopped , and it was 15 minutes before doctors could restart it by massage . It seemed unlikely that Hewitt could live after such a long stoppage of circulation to the brain . Hewitt surprised his doctors . <P> He spent weeks in a deep coma and recovering , bit by bit , the power to focus his eyes , speak , understand and remember things . Within a year , he was back at his mother 's home ( TIME , Aug. 18. 1952 ) , but as he learned to walk and talk better and coordinate more efficiently , he became restless and overactive , sometimes violent . So he was admitted to the V.A . ' s Brentwood Neuropsychiatric Hospital . <P> There , Dr. Sidney Cohen reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hewitt , now 30 , and neither do efforts to retrain him . He can remember nothing of the recent past , but " his recall of the ancient material learned during his youth is phenomenal . " He can sing ballads popular 20 years ago , recite the Gettysburg Address , play checkers and do grade-school arithmetic . He can name the first but not the present President of the U.S. Hewitt 's overall I.Q. has gone up from 52 after the injury to 71 , but nearly all the gain is from improvement in his control of movements and using his sense of sight . <P> Says Dr. Cohen in summary : " He remains disoriented , with poor judgment , flattened emotional responses and a profound amnesia . The outlook is poor , but not completely without hope that he may some day be able to ... manage outside the hospital . " Cases like Hewitt 's will become more common , Dr. Cohen points out ( Brentwood already has two more ) , as the practice spreads of opening the chest to massage a stalled heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
