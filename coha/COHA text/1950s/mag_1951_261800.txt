Two months ago , Nepal 's King Tribhubana fled from the despotic rule of his hereditary Prime Minister Rana and took refuge in India ( TIME , Nov. 20 ) . Last week King Tribhubana got ready to return to his throne . Prime Minister Rana had agreed to changes in the Himalayan kingdom which his family had bossed for 104 years . Promised reforms : 1 ) equal representation in the cabinet for the anti-Rana Nepal Congress Party ; 2 ) election of a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution ; 3 ) amnesty for political prisoners . Rana gave in mostly because of pressure from India whose antimonarchist leaders had backed the King 's cause . When he returned to Nepal , King Tribhubana would also take back some new dance steps he had learned in New Delhi nightspots.
