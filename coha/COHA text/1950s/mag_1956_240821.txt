In choosing the man to oppose Liberal Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent in next summer 's national election , the opinion was gaining ground in Progressive Conservative ranks that the time had come to take a calculated risk with a fresh leader , unbruised and unwearied by the Tories ' past defeats in five straight elections . Ideally , he would be a man widely known and respected across the country , an able administrator , a good speaker , gifted with the intellect and energy to guide Canada 's destiny as Prime Minister or serve as a rousing leader of the opposition in Parliament . The man best qualified and most frequently mentioned as a dark-horse candidate last week was Sidney Earle Smith , 59 , president of the University of Toronto . <P> As head of the country 's biggest university , Sidney Smith has made a notable reputation as an administrator ; he boosted the school 's enrollment 65% ( to 11,500 ) and launched a $60 million expansion program in the past ten years . Educator Smith has also traveled widely throughout Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches on almost every aspect of contemporary Canadian life ( TIME , Oct. 6 , 1952 ) .

Protestant Smith has strong backing in Roman Catholic Quebec because of his support of religious teaching in schools and the fact that he speaks French . <P> <P> Smith 's potential appeal has long been recognized by politicians , and he has been under pressure before to get into politics . The idea appealed to him . but the circumstances were never quite right for the move . Now , although he is in good health and is , in fact , the same age as St. Laurent when the Prime Minister entered politics in 1941 , Smith is inclined to believe that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuilding the Tory Party . But Smith has not yet said that he would refuse the nomination , and many Tories are hopeful that he may still be available for a genuine draft call at their convention next month . The Liberals are just as hopeful that he will not . Said a Liberal Cabinet minister , very much off the record : " He is the one man we could n't figure out how to attack . "
