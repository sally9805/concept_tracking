Sometimes , on the way to work for the brokerage firm of Montgomery , Scott &amp; Co . I look at other commuters and wonder what sort of tests their marriages have been subjected to . It 's hard to compare lives . I always thought mine was average : happy , sometimes boringly uneventful , but certainly a chunk of American life . Yet traveling between Paoli and Philadelphia , I ca n't help but glance at other men and wonder if they 've been through retrievers. // The fact is , retrievers gave me enough fodder to keep the I-have-a-problem page of a newspaper full for a month . I had the works . My wife suddenly found another world . Her thoughts were completely consumed by Labradors . At times I seriously considered practicing the crawl with a duck in my mouth just so she would look . // I know now , of course , that I should have foreseen certain angles of this way back in 1939 when I was selling for the du Pont Co. in Kentucky . That is where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse show in Louisville , where I saw a very attractive girl trying to clamber onto a horse . A bad back was killing her . I slipped over and boosted her aboard  --  and that was Anne . So instead of the usual nostalgic memory , the dress she wore or the music the orchestra played , I 'll always remember her if-it-kills-me approach to a sporting event . During our courtship this attitude should have become even more apparent because I was caught up in the horse whirl . I rode races , chased foxes and damn near broke my neck . Dedication was expected of me , and if it underlined the importance of the events , it also worried me  --  it could underline the unimportance of my neck . // After we were married , horses still monopolized Anne . But I did n't know when I was well off . Had I known , I would have been thankful that you ca n't get a horse into the house or into a station wagon . // We 'd always had dogs . Both Anne and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had around the house were nice , homey pot-lickers . Then Anne 's back really flared up , and she had to undergo a major operation . With a feeling of guilt I saw a ray of hope because it ended Anne 's riding . Perhaps , I thought , we 'd be together more now . How blind I was ! // It started innocently enough . Shortly after Anne was able to be up and around we were at a cocktail party . Conversation with an English girl was coming slowly , so I thought I 'd throw in retrievers . It worked wonders ; as a matter of fact , this girl 's father bred and trained Labradors in England , and before I was through we were promised a pup . I forgot the offer , honestly thinking it might have been the second Martini with an English accent . // Six months later , at dinner , we received a cable saying that at 7 a.m. the next morning a Lab pup , consigned to us , would arrive at Idlewild Airport . Therewith began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a couple of weeks ' training and then was ready to pick up birds . I did have sense enough to know a good dog was important to anyone who shot . Nothing makes me madder than losing a winged duck or a running , crippled pheasant , so when Anne said she wanted to train Sabu I was all for it . // Before I knew it Anne was getting up at 5 a.m. , driving to Maryland or Delaware  --  a good two to three hours one way  --  and coming home at 7 p.m . I 'd be showered and thirsty and waiting for her when the station wagon would go right by the house and down to the kennel . After a while Anne would come back and pass me on the terrace with hardly a word , her thoughts still miles away . Sometimes she 'd be terribly happy and at other times on the verge of tears . She might go right into the house and call a Vance person or a Jay person , one of the two professional trainers with whom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way home she thought she 'd doped out why Sabu kept missing his second bird . Eavesdropping did me little good because the jargon was from another world . There 'd be long periods of silence while the man at the other end of the line took a whack at my phone bill . // Immediately , I started to fight the Field Trial Game . When Anne returned with that glazed expression of canine concentration , I 'd really have trouble forcing my way into her thoughts . And because her hair was wild , her canvas trousers filthy and I had been the one to wait , the whole scene was the exact opposite of the gingham-and-garden-gate motif . When I saw I could n't fight it , I tried joining it . I would be the interested mate , trying to learn through guessing at the meaning of the new terms what was going on . All I gathered was that Sabu was n't really learning a darn thing . // Anne read books with a concentration I had n't had a hint she possessed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb Free ) became the bible of her new creed . I thought the next reference to the character who wrote this book would cause me to commit something violent . What difference did it make if a dog sat down when he gave you a duck or stood on his head ? He got a swim . You got your duck . I saw no reason to want anything more . // Actually , this retriever training seemed to me to be a good spawning bed for manic-depressives . Besides the terrific concentration , there 's the terrible emotional pendulum swing . I gathered that you placed yourself and your dog in a spot where the view was n't necessarily the best . You had a small whistle , far more important than a violinist 's violin , with which you had been practicing under bedroom windows . You had your dog sitting next to you . Someone threw some kind of a bird in the nastiest possible place , say in the water among stumps which looked exactly like the bird , and with a carefully studied gesture you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing everything in the prescribed manner , you were in heaven . But if he stopped to commit a nuisance on the return , you were ready to hang yourself with your whistle cord . // Anne 's preoccupation was unbelievable . One day she loaded the station wagon with all her paraphernalia and dashed down to Maryland only to find she 'd forgotten to load her dogs in their crates . // Perhaps I was slow to realize the magnitude of the whole picture . Several things lulled me into false security . New friends entered our lives , and they were attractive and only mildly boring about their dogs . At least none of them had a dog called Sabu . So it was a change . But I should have seen in them the dedication that I could n't help but see in Anne and realized she was on a junkie 's junket . These people are snow sniffers doing everything they can to stimulate each other 's craving. // Compared to being outside your wife 's retriever addiction , the lonely city  --  supposedly the epitome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie Tucker . But with Teddy IV away at school , I 'd either have to spend weekends alone or go to trials . However , I was bound and determined to hate everything about them , and I had no trouble with my resolution when I learned that takeoff time for my first trial at Easton , Maryland was at 4 a.m. // We arrived in miserable weather , around 7 , with an hour to kill . This is standard . I knew a few of the people , but in many ways I 've never felt quite so much the outsider . I was anxious to watch the two professionals who were seeing far more of my wife than I. Both Vance Morris and Jay Sweezey went out of their way to be nice to me . I had to concentrate on my firm stand not to be taken in by their engaging personalities . // Everyone wore foul-weather clothing . The men , other than the professionals , sported Tyrolean hats with bands surrounded by buttons . One of these buttons means the wearer 's dog once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wimbledon . // The women also wore rubberized play suits . I was to learn that , no matter what the weather , the female garb at trials is not based on allure . // I hung around the few people I knew and then drifted off , realizing that those who were to run dogs were preoccupied . As time dragged , I steeled myself against sharing Anne 's nervous excitement . // Finally she was on the line , Sabu sitting alertly next to her and the man who was judging standing behind her . This was the first series , or test , and to my horror I realized the better the dog the longer the day , because the ones who flub are eliminated . // Sabu went out after his first bird like an arrow . In all honesty it was only my will power that kept me from having a small twinge of pride . After that I smiled at a few strangers , and it was n't long  --  I checked by the growth of my beard  --  until Sabu was on the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . Anne sent him out and he circled around madly like a demented pixie , doing nothing . Now I experienced another trial emotion . Do you remember the kidney-affecting pause when a good friend got up to recite in school and his mind went blank , a shared shame ? I think Anne must have stood there , a pitiful character , alone in the mist , for at least an hour . Occasionally she 'd barely hunch a shoulder trying to telepathize Sabu over toward the bird . Again will power kept me from allowing my pity to really materialize . I remember someone ignominiously walking over , picking up the bedraggled pheasant and ingloriously heaving it so this dumbbell dog would n't add inferiority to his complexes . Sabu had had it for that trial . // At last it was finished and we started home . Anne seemed depressed . I glanced at her sitting next to me and wondered if Sabu 's fiasco could have been a possible cure . Suddenly she said , " Stop the car . " Thinking she might be ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // She jumped out and let Sabu out of his crate . I slid out from under the wheel and took in the horrifying scene . Anne had Sabu lined up next to her facing the direction from which we 'd come . With a carefully studied gesture , she sent him down the road toward a flock of turkeys . Gobbling hysterically they flopped into the brush . I think Anne suddenly realized what she 'd done because she also got a note of hysteria into her whistle . There was a long silent wait  --  I felt eyes from all directions  --  and then Sabu appeared , jogging blind because of a turkey wing over his eyes . After one somersault in the ditch he delivered the turkey to Anne and she released it , seemingly none the worse for wear . Anne made her dog sit , opened the crate ( $47.50 f.o.b. ) and with another gesture said , " Kennel . " Sabu hopped in , and we went back to the front seat . // I 'd said little and what I had said was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental anguish . She had risked possible imprisonment to prove to herself that Sabu had some retrieve in him . There had to be a future , and somehow , someway , by sheer , concentrated brooding , she had to be able to figure out the day 's boo-boo . We drove on , Anne brooding and I saddened because I could see today had only whetted her craving. // This was the first of a seemingly endless string of trials . Also it was the start of a whole string of dogs . They appeared , took up a corner room of the expensive kennel and then did their best to develop something  --  either physical or mental  --  heretofore unheard of . Sabu had n't a chance in the majors because he would rivet his eyes on the first gun to get into action and ignore completely the second gun and naturally the second bird , too , during the second half of a double  --  a double being two birds thrown , the dog usually getting the second bird and then being sent for the first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . // Instead of my problems getting any better they became worse . If I stayed out of things I felt as though I were putting on an unnoticed pout . If I joined and went so far as to have an opinion , I was jumped on and made to feel the ignorant nincompoop . I fought a mixed battle , shifting my style and trying to answer each round with something new . // The let-me-help-you-Dear attack flopped . No husband can throw two dummies in a row to suit his wife , plus the fact your arm undergoes considerable discomfort . The **45;176;TOOLONG angle I thought would baffle Anne . It backfired on me. // We had a miserable little bitch . Everyone  --  at the other end of a long long-distance phone call  --  said , " Give up . " So I thought I 'd throw the secret punch , " Do n't give up yet . Let me run her . " As I said , it backfired on me . She did let me run her . // You know , out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You feel a little pressure . All this kindergarten stuff you 've been ridiculing gets a bit complicated . I said , " Sit , " and I had a whistle in my mouth . Stinker was twisting around , shoving against me and looking over her shoulder for Anne , although Anne and Stinker had n't exchanged a kind thought in months . The judge was about to ask me if I was ready when Stinker took off . She shot behind the cars with me in embarrassed pursuit . Finally I found her in the clutches of a stranger who had been kind enough to hook his leash to her . I remember feeling a little bad because my thanks were perfunctory and I thought I noticed a mystified expression on the man as he saw my panic . I ran back to the line and apologized to the judge . Just as I had Stinker sitting and I was hoping the judge would get the damn ordeal over with , the stranger came up and asked for his dog , please . // The ripple of laughter did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would make me a good sport . My laugh rang out like a hog call . The judge added to my panic by suggesting I take my time and find my dog . I staggered again toward the parked cars . I found Anne hanging onto Stinker , racked with dry gasps of the most unsympathetic mirth I had ever seen . // I managed to get back on the line again . Stinker was sitting next to me . The judge asked me if I was ready . I nodded . He signaled with his clip board , and a couple of shots were fired beyond my misty vision . I waited for him to say my number  --  a nasty trial trick to check if a dog is really steady  --  and after a pause , the longest in my life , he said 22 . Stinker twitched but did n't break . As I reached down trying to remember the conductor-of-a-symphony poise of the gesture , I was horrified to see Stinker was on one side and I was using the opposite hand . Fear made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was bowling for a spare . At least I impressed Stinker because she saw my hand , realized my mistake and dashed around behind me  --  almost knocking me over  --  and nailed her bird without putting a foot wrong . When the judge reminded me I had another bird , I realized I had never seen it . I sent Stinker anyway , but she was in the same boat as I was and just disappeared . The judge excused me from the line . // This harrowing day will always stand out in my memory as a turning point . There were several things which had previously dawned on me but I had refused to succumb . I had had to admit that both Vance and Jay were wonderful guys , but nothing had forced me to be any more than polite about their ability . Of course , this was practiced stubbornness on my part and not based on any logic . I 'll admit it . // Suddenly I began to see  --  and accept  --  the fact that the professionals , such as Vance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no substitute for the ability to be able to sense the temperament and I.Q. of an individual dog ; to know the things you , yourself , can do  --  and should n't do  --  with a dog whose characteristics are those of the dog in question . And there is no substitute for experience to build this ability . I do n't care how many books you read . Sure , there 's the quality X which makes you have dog insight , and something which makes dogs like and respect you just as horses will run for some jocks . And the books can cover the fundamentals , but the difference between the old pro and the amateur is something . // I mention Vance and Jay because they are typical , though not necessarily cast from the same mold , and because I happen to know them better than any of the rest . And I stress the professionals because , by devoting all their time , they are able to be the top handlers. // They all have a love of the outdoors , wing shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . It 's hard work  --  they got into the game because they loved it , not because they thought they could make a. living having fun with a minimum of work . // Jay Sweezey is 32 . He looks like a ballplayer , big , rugged and healthy . He comes from Oceanside on Long Island , where he was always crazy about gunning . He owned a female Lab , Honker , who showed a lot of potential . It was only natural that he wanted to see how she 'd stack up with other retrievers so he started running her . At this time he was still going to college and selling nursery stock . Jay was young and cocky ; looking back , he says now , " I thought she could do it with little or no training , but I soon learned otherwise . " Henry Sears saw in Jay the man he wanted to handle his dogs and run his shooting place in Maryland , and Jay 's character probably had as much to do with Mr. Sears 's choice as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , runs a public kennel . Anyone with a prospect can get Vance 's help , but the pessimistic odds of ever having a dog win the 10 points to become a Field Trial Champion is one of the first things Vance will tell a newcomer . He does n't paint a rosy picture . Yet , in the 14 years he has been training , Vance has missed running in the National only once . // These men are keenly competitive yet they have some wonderful unwritten laws . Even during a trial there is an intense loyalty between them ; they think nothing of giving each other hints . Perhaps a tricky wind current baffled their dog , and the man they warn might be taking the very dog on the line that could beat them . They 're fast friends , they 'll train together , share something new that they 've learned , and often stay with each other if one lives in the neighborhood of a trial . // You could n't paint a composite owner , but one thing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure in watching a good dog run . Even when I was completely ignorant I had to admit to myself that the easy competence of a good dog , comparable to natural athletes making the rough ones look easy , was a thrill provoker . And when the older dogs start to handle  --  take hand signals , stop on a single whistle blast , then take the new direction to a hidden bird while their handlers are sometimes 200 yards away  --  well , it 's unbelievable . // The owners are people from all walks of life who accepted this challenge : " Could I do that ? And where would I find a dog that could do that ? " Most of them can afford it , but there are many who have to scrimp and save to pay the entrance fees and the traveling expenses . There is no financial gain unless you are terribly lucky and your dog 's tremendous reputation brings you in something for stud fees , plus the sale of a few of his pups . But any dog 's life is comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , there 's a policeman , a truck driver and a barber running dogs who could easily earn their Field Trial Championship . // A dog 's performance is more important than his conformation . Few trial people ever show their dog unless they have a chance of adding " dual " to his title , a champion on the bench as well as in the field . // The trial people are surprisingly well informed about each other and each other 's dogs . The U.S. , for retriever purposes , is split roughly into four zones  --  approximately the time zones  --  and everyone knows if a dog does anything worthwhile in any of the other three . // It 's hard to put the finger on it , but the easy atmosphere and the nomad sort of life have appeal . Each trial is an annual or biannual meeting for many and the common bond makes people at ease with each other . Because things happen beyond the control of money , man and machine  --  only the dogs can explain  --  trial people have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they did n't they 'd go mad , or madder . In one word  --  if the word " class " pertains largely to the ability to make other people comfortable in your presence , trial people have " class . " // So my capitulation is pretty complete . Habit made me hang on to some reservations but they were dissipated two years ago at the Swamp Dog Trial held near our home in Sugartown , Pa . Anne was running a derby ( a dog up to 2 years old ) called Bat . The best derbies in the country were competing . // The first series was a long single . I stood as close as I dared and felt the tightening of every muscle when the bird fell . I think my heart joined the rhythm of Bat 's driving run . He nailed his bird and delivered it beautifully . Inwardly I hated the thought of having to wait ; something about Bat 's drive told me this could be his day . // Between series my mind returned to the endless hours spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up suddenly and reviving good moments when we could see Bat 's marking , memory , manners and hunting ability develop . // The next series was a heartbreaker . A gust of wind blew the second half of a water double against a wall which formed a part of a dam . Bat searched the area where the bird originally fell ; then he cased the decoys , one by one , and finally he found his bird by sheer perseverance , blown against the wall . He tried to climb out . He 's a short-legged guy and he could n't make it . There was something pathetic yet ludicrous about his predicament ; his front feet hung on the wall , looking over his shoulder for Anne  --  with a duck in his mouth , his expression saying , " Now what the hell do I do ? " // Horrified , I glanced at Anne . She was starting to smile around her whistle . I wondered if she would be able to blow it . I could have heaved her in the drink . But Bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recalled for the next series . My excitement became an inward pressure . The intervening minutes dragged unmercifully . // Another mean trial was in prospect : a water double . While the guns shot the second bird the first guns hid , removing a reference point so that a young dog 's memory was really put to the test . Bat nailed both birds as if he were a metal filing being pulled to a magnet . More waiting , and then a single into briars . Bat drove in as though he wore armor . This was the last series and I walked around smiling at complimentary remarks about Bat while inside I was trying to control my hope . // When the judge placed the dogs the sound truck announced names in reverse order , starting with the dog that was fourth . When Bat 's name was n't mentioned for fourth or third , disappointment clutched me . I cursed the bird against the wall . Then the public-address system called his name for second place , the winner being a dog that was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried to walk but I guess I ran toward Anne . I had the feeling I 'd been caught by the lights after a sad movie . And it was all I could do not to make a damn fool of myself over both my wife and her dog . // But be careful : the other day a terrible thing happened to me . Walking down the street I stopped and looked into a store window . My mind was miles away , musing over a dog which , just to make it easy , we 'd imported from Montana . Suddenly I noticed my reflection . I was bent slightly at the waist , my right hand close to my right knee , the fingers rigid and held together as though I were going to salute . I straightened up immediately , glancing right and left , the color tingling my face . Panic seized me when I realized I was just about to send an imaginary retriever .                   @ @
