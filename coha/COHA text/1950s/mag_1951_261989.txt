" Under great inflationary pressures , you must have . . . direct controls , " said U.S. Economic Stabilizer Eric Johnston last week during a television interview at Washington . " I 'll give you one illustration of it , and that is Canada . " His point : Ottawa 's program of drastic fiscal controls was not going so well as the U.S. policy of price &; wage ceilings . Next day Ottawa announced that the cost-of-living index had jumped another 2.1% in May to 184.1% ; it had virtually reached the U.S. level of 185.4% . Since Washington applied price &; wage controls last January 26 , the U.S. index has climbed 2.1% ; during the same period , the Canadian index went up 5% ( see chart ) . <P> Most Canadians had learned the bad news in other terms than index percentages . Said Colin Lowery , a Vancouver clerk : " I bought a pair of shoes for my daughter yesterday for $9.25 . I bought the same shoes six weeks ago for $7.95 . Where 's it all going to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enterprising butcher sold 5,000 Ibs. of horse meat , for human consumption , up to 53 a lb. ; meanwhile , city sales of beefsteak , at 95 a lb. , decreased by as much as 50% . The price spiral had labor unions yelling for sharp wage increases . <P> The government was far from conceding Eric Johnston 's point . Though resentment against the rising cost of living had contributed to the Tory sweep in four recent by-elections , the Liberal government stuck to its policy of fighting inflation with fiscal controls : limiting credit and boosting taxes . Government economists insisted that without the patriotic pressures of all-out war , direct price &; wage controls could not be enforced . <P> Ottawa held that fiscal measures would ultimately pay off . Statistics showed that the credit limits and new taxes were appreciably cutting bank loans , capital expansion projects , sales of durable consumer goods . The deflationary pressure trend would be increased by a 20% hike in income taxes effective July 1 . The government had until October , when Parliament reconvenes , to prove its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the political pressure for direct controls will be difficult to defy much longer .
