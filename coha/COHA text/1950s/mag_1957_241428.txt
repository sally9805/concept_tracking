" You just let go of the plane and suddenly you 've changed elements . You start to drop but you do n't feel anything-only a marvelous sense of control . It 's like being immersed in light water . Then you bring your right arm up and you make a turn , just as simple as that . It 's an incredible sensation . " <P> Thus runs the evangelical message of Jacques Andr Istel , 28 , a black-browed ex-Wall Streeter and dedicated prophet of parachuting in the U.S. His gospel : jumping , without emergency , out of an airplane can be a safe , exhilarating sport , not a devil-daring performance for iron-nerved musclemen . Europe has been convinced since World War II , and there thousands of men and women of all ages happily spend their weekends halfway between plane and earth . It is time for the sport to flourish in the U.S. , says Istel . " There 's no more to parachute jumping , done right , than jumping in a swimming pool . " <P> <P> The Practiced Preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that last week he went to Washington to talk to the Civil Aeronautics Administration about safety regulations for parachuting for fun , similar to those in Europe , where jumping instruction is as rigidly controlled as the classics course in a French lyce . At this stage , Istel fears , a major accident would probably give the sport back to the country-fair stuntmen . His gospel spread to another important corner . Istel hustled back to his exurbanite home in New York 's upper Westchester County to practice what he preaches . This week Istel will lead an American team of four parachutists to Yugoslavia to compete in an invitational meet against some of the world 's best jumpers . <P> The technique that tamed sport parachuting , according to Istel , is sky diving , in which the jumper controls his body as he hurtles toward earth before pulling his ripcord . The skillful sky diver leaves the plane spread-eagled , looking somewhat like a highboard swan diver , his body horizontal . Despite falling speeds up to 120 m.p.h .. the body is remarkably stable in this position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidental spins can whirl or tumble the body up to three times a second , black out the jumper ) and keeps the diver on his belly , so his backpack chute can open without fouling . In addition , the sky diver becomes a sort of low-efficiency glider . By moving his arms and legs , he can change position in flight . even pull off a figure eight by use of hands and arms before cracking his chute and drifting to earth under its canopy .
