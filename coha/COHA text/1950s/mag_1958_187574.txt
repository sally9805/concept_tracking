One of the most important guideposts of the U.S. economy goes by the jawbreaking name of Diffusion Indexes of Business Indicators . The indexes , compiled by the National Bureau of Economic Research , are becoming widely used by major corporations and such top economists as Dr. Raymond J. Saulnier , head of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , and his predecessor , Arthur Burns , to predict the course of the economy . Last week the diffusion indexes gave a signal that the economy had about touched bottom . <P> Leaders &; Laggards . The indexes use statistics from 21 different areas that cover the important segments of the nation 's economy-production , employment , income , prices , etc . When all statistics are moving up , the diffusion indexes read 100 . When all are moving down , the indexes are zero . If half are moving up and half down , the indexes are 50 . When the indexes drop below 50 , it means the economy is contracting ; when they rise above 50 , the economy is expanding . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the Leading Series , 2 ) the Coincident Series , and 3 ) the Lagging Series ( see chart ) . <P> The Leading group is the most important because it generally gives the first signals as to where the economy is going rather than where it has been . It includes areas that have historically risen and fallen from four to nine months before the overall economy has changed course . Among the figures used in the Leading group : average man-hours worked in basic manufacturing industries , Dow-Jones industrial averages , new orders for durable goods , spot commodity prices , F. W. Dodge reports on industrial and residential construction contracts . <P> The Coincident Series includes key areas that have traditionally risen and fallen along with the general business cycle , e.g. , corporate profits , industrial production . The Lagging Series includes areas that generally lag behind the curve of the economy , e.g. , manufacturers ' inventories and interest rates on business loans . Finally , the Leading , the Coincident and the Lagging Series are added together in a composite index , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the past , when the Leading Series turned in one direction and the Composite Series moved in the same direction several months afterwards , the economy has usually followed in that direction . Therefore , the leaders give the first clues , and the composites later confirm them as a trend . <P> Alarms &; Accuracy . First compiled by Burns , now head of the National Bureau of Economic Research , the indexes have been expanded and sharpened by Bureau Economist Geoffrey Moore . As with all indicators , the diffusion indexes have produced some false alarms . But the Leading Series has forecast all the postwar recessions . Last May 1957 , two months before the economy reached the peak , the Leading group nosed down to signal trouble ahead . But the real warning came last August , when the composite index of all 21 areas started a fast slide .
