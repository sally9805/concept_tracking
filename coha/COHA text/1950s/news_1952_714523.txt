txt New state-wide telephone rates , which will add 25 cents a month to the cost of residential service and 75 cents a month to business service , effective Friday , were approved yesterday for the New York Telephone Company by the State Public Service Commission . The commission announced at its Woolworth Building offices that the total increase would amount to $20,700,000 a year . The increase sanctioned by the commission is designed to offset part of the new increases in Federal income taxes and employe wages that have become operative since last October . On Oct. 3 the commission denied the company 's request for an increase of $57,000,000 . This request was based partly on the com-1 pany 's expectation that its Federal income taxes would increase .

" We have had recent heavy increases in costs , and we need every penny of the award . We wish it were enough to offset the effect of inflation on our costs in the last two years , but it is n't , and this ntaurally remains a cause for concern . " As long as these costs and the costs of new construction continue at their present levels , or go higher under the impact of inflation , the company will face the prospect of its earnings continuing to wear away . " The new rates will be put into effect March ? 14 , however , and we will do the best job we can with them . They add less than 4 per cent on the average to telephone bills , and bring our over-all price increase in the last twenty-two years to only 15 per cent .
