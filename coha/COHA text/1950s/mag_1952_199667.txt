In St. Louis last week , Drs . Charles Belting , Maury Massler and Isaac Shour told the American Dental Association that at the age of 45. one out of every two men will have lost all his teeth or will be suffering from a disease of the gums or jawbone . For the toothless unfortunates , Dentists Stanley . Behrman and George F. Egan described a new method of locking false teeth in place with magnets . Protected by plastic and tantalum mesh , the magnets are imbedded in the jawbone and lock tight against similar magnets built into the denture.
