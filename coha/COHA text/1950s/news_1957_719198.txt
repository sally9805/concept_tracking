txt Our lives are not immediately changed by the existence of an artificial metallic satellite , about 23 inches in diameter , moving through space 560 miles above the earth 's surface at the rate of 18,000 miles an hour and pinging , beeping or chirping as it passes over . But this man-guided flight toward interplanetary space is a portent of enormous significance for man 's long future and for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow of this nation . * * We have been traveling with everincreasing speed toward the day whenman will have almost complete control over his environment . The creature who descended from a tree or crawled out of a cave a few thousand years ago is now on the eve of incredible journeys . Yet it is not these journeys that chiefly matter . Will we be happier for seeing the other side of the moon or strolling among the Martian meadows of asphodel ? The truth is at once more ominous , more exacting and more enchanting . The greatest adventure of all is not to go to the moon or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather , to understand the heart and soul of man and to turn away from wrath and destruction and toward creativeness and brotherly love . We can not look at the world today without realizing that our mastery of ourselves has not kept pace with our mastery of inanimate nature . We now have the power to destroy each other and all the works of civilization , but we have not yet invented a sure way to control this power . In a sense , a part of us never came down from the tree , never crawled out of the cave , Now we must arise out of our long childhood and play the part of wise , mature and humane men  --  all of us , all mankind , of whatever political or religious faith  --  or we shall surely die . This is humanity 's long-range problem . There is also , for this nation , a short-range problem , the solution of which might give us breathing space and time to plan and think . In the first White House action last Saturday to the Soviet space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the scientific importance of that achievement . This was entirely proper under the circumstances , but we may doubt that Mr. Hagerty or any other thoughtful American believes that the immediate importance of this feat is to be measured only , or even primarily , by the satellite 's contribution to the International Geophysical Year . Rather the Soviet space satellite now revolving in the skies obviously raises questions of the gravest ' character regarding the correctness of our present and- past national policies , Those questions must be faced unblinkingly . The essence of the matter , of course , is not- the space satellite itself . It is rather in what that satellite implies . To throw a body weighing 184 pounds into an orbit 560 miles above the earth 's surface required enormously great rocketpower . Rockets capable of performing the satellite feat must be assumed capable of delivering atomic and hydrogen , bombs many thousands , of miles . There has been some tendency in this country these past six weeks to doubt or- to minimize the significance of last August 's Soviet claim to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' evidence , it is the part of wisdom to assume that the Soviet Union does have such missile capability , and that it is now engaged ' in:a ? majOr effort to provide itself as soot. ; as possible with large numbers of such weapons . It is clear we do not have such missiles now , and the time when we may have them is uncertain . * * * In the light of this background , the questions that must be met frankly , both by our citizens and by our highest policy makers , are these : Is the world faced with a radical change in the military balance of power at that time , presumably to be measured in months or a small number of years , when the Soviet Union has enough such missiles to place every major United States city and base under threat . of annihilation ? Is the policy of putting domestic budgetary and political considerations ahead of security considerations in allocating funds for defense still a tenable policy in the present situation ? Are we making a maximum effort at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , to insure that we too have intercontinental ballistic missiles at the earliest possible time ? If not , should we not increase our effort so that it is the . maximum possible , one utilizing all the rich resources of our science , technology and industry ? Why did not our policy makers realize the tremendous prestige , propaganda , and political gains likely to accrue to the Soviet Union if it was the first to send up a space satellite , and why were not adequate steps taken to assure that eventuality would not arise ? These , and similar questions , are not easy to answer . The attempt to answer them must be made in a spirit born of neither complacency nor hysteria . But answered they must be . In answering them it may be well if our highest policy makers recall Adam Smith 's observation , almost 200 years ago , that for a1nation defense is better than opulence . Our policy makers should also bear in mind , and so should all of us , that it is war itself rather than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we prepare for war in order to make war impossible .
