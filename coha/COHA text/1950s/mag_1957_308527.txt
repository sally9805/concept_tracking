When Kansas Millionaire Bill Graham tried to spark a brush fire for capitalism in socialist-minded India last summer ( TIME , Aug. 12 ) , the government poured on cold water . Finance Minister T. T. Krishnamachari and others refused to see him . But last week Graham 's dream of financing capital-starved entrepreneurs ( " The small guy who 's on the ball " ) and making a profit to boot had become too important to ignore . When Graham landed in India with funds raised from free-enterprising Americans , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru himself sat down with the tireless enterpriser for a half-hour 's talk and wished him all success . Krishnamachari not only approved , but last week eased import restrictions on needed machinery for Graham projects and promised that all profits could be taken out of India . <P> The reason for the turnabout was plain . India is now desperate for foreign capital and sees in Graham a chance to show good will toward investors . On Graham 's part , there had been nothing but good will and hard work since last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Graham collected $250,000 from fascinated ' investors ranging all the way from the Rockefellers ' International Basic Economy Corp . ( $25,000 ) to an oil worker who offered $5,000 in $100 monthly installments and formed Private Enterprises Inc . <P> Money-Sucking Sands . On his way to India , Graham not only picked up two more $100 checks from pilots in midair , but planted some free-enterprise seeds along the way . In Athens he left $10,000 with a committee of bankers for local loans , another $6,200 in Istanbul and $10,000 in Beirut . Already approved are loans to a Greek furniture company , a Turkish spring-clip factory , a Lebanese cement contracting business . He landed in India with $220,000 left in hand and a lot more enterprise in mind . <P> In two weeks he trebled his capital . Indian Banker G. D. Birla , whom Graham met in San Francisco at the International Industrial Development Conference ( TIME , Oct. 28 ) , made good on a promise to match the capital in rupees . Another Indian millionaire promised an additional $200,000 in rupees ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. D. Tata , owner of 25-company Tata enterprises ( TIME , Sept. 30 ) , is expected to come in soon . <P> But to put all the money to work without throwing it away was another story . As Banker Birla put it : " Any fool can make money in the U.S. , but to make money in India is an art . India is like the sands of the desert , where money can disappear like water . " Because only " some success stories " can really get his crusade moving , Graham now believes that he must focus on bigger deals first before he can make the thousands of little ones he dreams of . In Bombay he put up $20,000 to match $20,000 in rupees " from Textile-man P. N. Kejriwal , who wants to build a nylon hosiery plant .
