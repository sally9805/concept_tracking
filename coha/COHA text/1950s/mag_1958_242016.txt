" So I am trying to say : let 's try to be reasonable , " replied Dwight Eisenhower when a reporter asked about antirecession spending . " Let 's try to use some common sense and not just get a Sputnik attitude about everything . " All last week the President kept a tight grip on the rule of reasonableness , surprised staff and Congress alike by using it to administer a sharp rap across the knuckles here , a threat there , to keep politically fired recession fears from getting out of bounds . <P> First off , he decided that the $1.7 billion pork-barrel rivers and harbors bill did not measure up to being reasonable , even though Congress had tried to pretend that it was an important antirecession remedy . Among the 154 projects in the barrelful , 28 costing $350 million looked like fat bacon . Example : one section of the bill laid out $269,000 to be spent on the lower Potomac River near Hull Creek , Va . to build a harbor for 41 small boats and 42 skiffs . Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by failing to promise matching funds for half the cost , flunked what the President considers " the best test yet devised for insuring that a project is sound . " So down came the veto on the whole bill , recession or no . <P> The other big appropriation on his desk was the $7.2 billion highway bill . Eisenhower did n't like its dimensions very well either . He had wanted to speed up highway spending by $2.2 billion over the next four years , but the Democrats had pumped this up to $1.8 billion in the next fiscal year alone . Far more serious , in the President 's eyes , was the fact that the bill abandoned the established principle that states should pay 50% on primary and secondary highways , provided instead that they should only pay 33% , and that the Federal Treasury should advance that . The Commerce Department had already leaked the word that the President would veto . But Senate G.O.P. Leader William Knowland and Vice President Richard Nixon warned that the bill was the best they could hope to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectionable features would expire in one year . Eisenhower , trying to be reasonable about reasonableness , signed the bill into law , but added : " I would oppose any repetition of these or similar provisions in subsequent legislation . " <P> The clear Eisenhower go-slow line involved considerable political risk . In standing against tax cuts , in heading off dreamboat public-works projects that he thought would ultimately contribute to inflation , Ike was staking the Republican reputation in an election year on his basic faith in the U.S. economy . If he was right , the recession would some day be forgotten , and the pundits would turn happily to the next crisis . If he was wrong , the Democrats would never let the nation forget that they were its true heroes . <P> Last week the President also : <P> Admitted in answer to a question about future summit talks that he " would n't have any brief now to file as to the accomplishments of the 1955 Geneva Conference .
