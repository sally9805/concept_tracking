A DEVIL IN PARADISE ( 128 pp. ) - Henry Miller-New American Library ( 25/ ) . <P> <P> " With Moricand I entered new waters . Moricand was not only an astrologer and a scholar steeped in the hermetic philosophies , but an occultist . . . Rather tall , well built , broad-shouldered , heavy and slow in his movements , he might have been taken for a descendant of the American Indian family . . . Perhaps the closest description I can give of him at the outset of our acquaintance is that of a Stoic dragging his tomb about with him . " <P> Thus , with a bright spurt of one of the most carefully wasted literary talents of the century , Author Henry Miller admits readers into his own first meeting with Conrad Moricand . Conrad must be conceded to be one of the least lovely characters of modern times . He was an astrologer , drug addict , scholar , louse , lamprey or - to reduce it all to Miller 's own explicit prose-a " phoney bastard . " <P> This book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printable author of Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn , and it makes a readable , sometimes hilarious appetizer to a more thorough work scheduled to come out early next year under the title Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch . <P> Lamprey Moricand attached himself to Miller in Paris in 1936 . Once he had been rich , but by then he was destitute , his only assets being the fine art of conversation and the black art of astrology . Miller gave him minute sums of money , and served him up as a dinner-table oddity among the bohemian intellectuals and expatriates . Miller also got him astrological commissions among his friends and , when friends ran short , invented imaginary characters for whom Moricand would supply horoscopes . It proved to be an expensive game . <P> After the war Moricand scouted out Miller 's place of rest in California . Miller was living precariously in a cabin above the cliffs at Big Sur with a young wife ( his third ) , a small daughter , a plenitude of unpaid bills and an uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fetch the moribund Moricand from his rats ' castle in Switzerland to the solitude of Miller 's own Walden Pond ( the Pacific Ocean ) . Moricand saluted Miller , systematically went about the business of making himself master in Miller 's house . He became Mrs. Miller 's ally in her daily quarrels with Miller . He demanded gauloises bleues cigarettes , special tooth powder of pumice , writing paper of a special shape . He refused to be pacified by the Pacific , and he plugged his air less room so that no fresh air could leak in . Finally , he demanded drugs . <P> Moricand contributed to the household only one tangible asset , a collection of his exquisitely detailed pornographic drawings . But he declined to sell them to Hollywood connoisseurs . Miller 's friends advised him to get rid of his incubus , but Moricand insisted on regarding the papers Miller had signed to get the man into the U.S. as a moral and legal obligation upon Miller to support him . <P> After three months Miller purged his household of Conrad - but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller 's relations with his wife , urged stern discipline for Miller 's daughter , plunged Miller into combat with his best friends , and got himself deported back to France . <P> As a parting gesture , Moricand pronounced a curse on Miller .
