" Getting the bugs out " is standard procedure whenever anything as complex as a new airplane is delivered . The trouble with Central African Airways ' brand-new Vickers Viscount propjet was that the bugs would not go . They were not , in fact , airplane-type bugs at all , but a swarm of 75,000 bees which came hiving out of nowhere soon after the plane landed in Salisbury , to take up happy residence in one of its wings . Central 's mechanics scattered , and to replace them , the airline called in a local beekeeper , Jack Garrett . Blow smoke or gas into the wing , he advised . No , said the airline engineers : formic acid from the dead bees might hurt the metal or the rubber on the gas tanks . <P> A man from Durban thought that garlic might help . A Londoner suggested tying a horse under the wing . " Bees , " he wrote , " do n't like the smell of horses , but wrap him carefully so he wo n't get stung . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good whiff of bruised lemontree leaves . C.A.A . ' s chief pilot decided on more drastic action . Taking his place at the controls , he flew skyward to 17,000 ft. , bumped , banked and looped-but when he got down again , the busy bees were still happily humming in the wing . <P> At week 's end airline officials decided that there was nothing to do but wheel their brand-new plane into a hangar and take it apart .
