Is psychoanalysis a cure-all for the minor ills of the mind ? Or is it a costly fad full of humbug ? Few healing techniques of modern times are fought over with such violent partisanship as the long-drawn-out Freudian analysis . For the past fortnight , a layman and two prominent psychiatrists have carried on the argument in the Nation . <P> " My husband and I were recently divorced upon the suggestion of his psychiatrist , " wrote Dorothy Ferman ( pseudonym of a former newspaperwoman and advertising writer ) . " Several weeks later my husband voluntarily entered a sanitarium to be treated for depression . I , too , am depressed ; I 'm also angry . In our lives there was no mother-in-law , no ' other ' man or woman . But there was always a psychiatrist . " <P> Oversimplification . Writer Ferman complains that her husband became utterly dependent upon his analyst . As a social-work executive , he said , " to hive had an analysis was as desirable as to hold an advanced academic degree . " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in a woman 's way , " but Jim went running from one analyst to another . Eventually , he tried to get Dorothy to go to an analyst . She refused , largely because of the cost , and concluded : " What it might do for me was less important than the fact that it would initiate me into the cult . " <P> Her experience with Jim left Dorothy with some strong views : " I ca n't see that a mother 's apron strings are much worse than a psychiatrist 's couch . Maybe it is unsophisticated and ' naive oversimplification ' to handle one 's own problems to the best of one 's ability . . . But something like this was the basis of mental health for hundreds of years before Adler , Jung and Freud . " <P> Impertinence . The Nation 's editors gave " a number of prominent psychiatrists " advance copies of the Ferman article and invited them to reply . Most refused . But from outspoken Psychiatrist-Author Fredric ( The Show of Violence ) Wertham came outspoken agreement : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have encountered literally dozens of similar cases . . . Psychiatrists and psychoanalysts are the only physicians who blame the patient-or at least his relatives-when they do not cure him . " <P> From his long experience in New York City , Dr. Wertham was convinced that eight out of ten psychoanalyses should not have been started , and that six out of ten were more harmful than helpful . " I believe . . . that the patients are often right , and so are their relatives , " he concluded . " If this be treason , send me to St. Elizabeth 's ! "
