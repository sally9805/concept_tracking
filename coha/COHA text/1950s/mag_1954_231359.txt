The arrival in Washington of the Premier of France stirred up more than ordinary interest on the part of the public and the public 's servants . As he made his official rounds last week , Pierre Mends-France was greeted everywhere by swarms of curious , often applauding Washingtonians , eager for a glimpse or a snapshot of the most-discussed , most controversial Frenchman since General Charles de Gaulle . Mends-France had been characterized variously as a fickle Gallic opportunist and as a pin-striped Savonarola who preached hard truths . Preparing to return to France this week , the brisk little Premier had not settled that argument . Administration officials were impressed-but they still had reservations about Pierre Mends-France . <P> Before he arrived , rumors reached Washington that Mends-France was coming as a sort of Peking Tom , that he would propose U.S. recognition of Red China in exchange for a Red Chinese guarantee to restrain the Viet Minh in tottering Indo-China . In the midst of the rumors . Senator William Knowland interrupted the McCarthy censure debate for a speech on foreign policy ( see above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cause for alarm : Mends and Dulles quickly agreed that recognition of Red China was not one of the questions they would discuss . <P> The inscrutable Premier and his chic wife swam easily through the usual VIP routine of ceremonials , speeches and official wining and dining . At the White House Mends discussed the Saar agreement with President Eisenhower for nearly an hour , then topped off a steak luncheon with a big glass of milk . At the Senate he was greeted warmly , and at the statue of La Fayette , opposite the White House , he placed a wreath of white chrysanthemums . <P> While the Premier bustled about Washington , Mme. Mends-France was busy fulfilling her own social obligations , including tea with Mrs. Eisenhower and a luncheon with Mrs. Dulles . Wherever she went , the Egyptian-born Lily Mends-France was an instant hit-for her piquant beauty , her gentle good humor , and her dazzling wardrobe of Parisian gowns . <P> No Flirtation . Mends-France 's most effective public appearance was at a National Press Club luncheon , where he explained France 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised early French ratification of the Paris agreements for a united defense of free Europe , scorned the Soviet proposal for a Pan-European conference and dispelled doubts that he might be thinking of a Franco-Russian flirtation . " As Prime Minister of France , " he said , " I am convinced that our number one task is to fight against the deceptive attractions of Communism with the positive weapons of truth , justice and progress . " <P> In the question period that followed his speech . Mends-France answered the reporters ' queries expertly . The final question was a stinger- " Do you think Mr. Dulles would be happier if you were ousted as Premier ? " - and Mends read it with a faint smile . " My suggestion to the author of this very interesting question , " he said , " is : the best way to know the answer is to ask Mr. Dulles. "
