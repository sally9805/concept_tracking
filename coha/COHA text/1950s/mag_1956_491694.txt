Spring had been late this year . In Febru- dry and March , 1. , iin drenched the coastal lands of the Northwest , but static cold held the high country lucked in a frozen grip . Snow-survey crews had worked through the winter , measuring the depth of snowfall in the mountains at the headwaters of the Charles River , the Black Fork , the Elk and the Clear Water . " Above average , " the reports had read . " Heaviest in years . " In January , the men in the various offices of the Corps of Engi  --  neers had begun to think in terms of flood . They knew the dikes of the big river would not stand in the face of a major flood . They had said so repeatedly , in the public prints and in the carefully worded requests for funds pre  --  sented each year to the Congress of the United States . But those who slashed the top-heavy national budget found the flood-control item one easy to eliminate . Daily reports from a hundred sources came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who tabulated them had to go deep into the files to find a year when the big river and its tributaries had been so low in April . By mid-May what had been probable was now a certainty . Only the date and the old mate size of the flood were in question . Civil-defense authorities and state and city officials were alerted . But the machinery of govern  --  ment is ponderous and slow to move when money must be spent , particularly when those who write the warning bulletins can only say , " In our opinion , the threat of flood is valid and imminent . " May was a month of waiting . Warm rains fell in the first week of June . Temperatures rose , the freezing level lifted slowly . White wa  --  ter foamed in the streams on the lower moun  --  tain slopes . The Charles River began to rise , then the Black Fork , the Elk . The big river nudged at the gauge floats  --  lazily , as if testing its strength . The weather picture changed . A Chinook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the static cold . Overnight , spring came to the mountains . Everywhere in the high country , all at once , the runoff began . The Charles left its banks to drown a dairy farmer in his bed . The rampaging Black Fork swept a half dozen bridges from their piers . Flood gauges on the Elk and the Clear Water jumped wildly upward . A day later , the big river smashed a dike and wrecked a grange hall , two farmhouses and a crossroads store . Flood ! Now the word was everywhere : news  --  paper headlines , radio and TV . Greenfield. at the foot of the mountains , the inland terminus of navigable water , was the first city in feel the brunt of it . Houseboats and boathouses and pleasure craft were torn from their moorings . The pavement of Main Street was under water and the end was not in sight . Greenfield was the first to be flood-mauled Downstream , all along the big river , the ma  --  chinery of state and local government was moving now , crash priority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus or minus dike-top elevation ? and marked the dikes that could not be saved . Evacuation of low-lying areas was begun , with the help Army personnel and vehicles . Construction crews with trucks and power shovels and bull  --  dozers moved in to streng ? ! . ? . ? rt:kes might be held . Labor gangs were recruited on the streets of all the river towns and cities ? anyone and everyone who could use a shovel or carry a sandbag There were n't enough men available to do the work that had to be done . Below Green  --  field , a ten-mile stretch of dike collapsed in a dozen places . A convoy of Army trucks was caught , stilt loading , in Frenchman 's Glen The known flood dead topped the hundred mark . Other evacuations , downstream . did not qui as planned . Some people flatly refused to IcaVr their ! mint  --  S. tAlleri returned to guard their possessions . Culling across fields and through wood tuts to avoid police roadblocks . There were n't enough men available . Army camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Greenfield chat 's was the girder of the day . There were n't enough police to man the rnadhlocks , direct tragic and prevent looting Relief agencies could riot yet care for the homeless and the hungry and the cold , and the crest or the florid was still to come . Greenfield was first , Bridgeton next . Con  --  struction crews worked around the clock . There were n't enough men , though city and county jails were opened , the most dependable prisoners thrown into the fight . Every hour was important . Hard-pressed officials in Leb  --  annon , next in the flood 's path , turned to the state prison there for help . Men front the honor farm worked beside the citizens of the town . Then the trusties were recruited . Fi  --  nally , pre. , in officials asked for volunteers from the heavy-labor gangs . These w err shock troops . Expendable , though the word was never used . The incorrigibles and those who had attempted escape were screened from the volunteers . Those remain  --  ing were told off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trucks rolled north through Lebannon before daylight , tak  --  ing them to the trouble spots . Tom Sharkey 's crew was dropped near the midpoint of the Humboldt dike , where wind and weather had damaged its earthen bulk . Greenfield and Bridgeton were abet them . Lcbannon was ten miles downriver . Lebannon , huddled un  --  der the ridges . was already in trouble , and the crest was an estimated thirty or forty hours away . Below Lehatrium , the big river was tear  --  ing at the dikes of West Mills , Biddleford and Franklin . Tom Sharkey 's crew worked in a driving rain . Twelve men , wearing square-billed caps , linigans and gray prison denim , so rnud  --  smeared that the numbers stenciled on their shirts could not he mid . They were a fair cross-suction of the pivilation of the prison ? .1 lurger , t , tr thieves , burglars , a safe man , a mid  --  ster. a man who 'd specialized in armed robbery , and a convicted murderer serving a life term . They filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharkey , who wore a slicker and rubber hoots and carried a .50-30 rifle in the crook of his arm . The big and swollen river was cast of them .

A red raft that had once been a barn door passed dose by , spinning slowly , ridden by a shivering dog . Sonic . of the convicts halted work to shout encouragement . Doc Barr  --  three-time loser , five years served , four years to go  --  asked Tom Sharkey to use his rifle . Put him out of his miser ? . " make it , " Sharkey said . " He can SWiret . " " More'n I can do , " Doc Barr said . There was a toad of sorts atop the dike . Dump trucks brought sand and sacks . At noon , food came  --  sandwiches wrapped in waxed paper , cold coffee in a gallon jug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to stand and hold a rifle and keep a nose rutin ' can skip a meal or Iwo . He ttnOcii his lunch to the turn and saw his sandwiches torn by muddy hands , the pieces passed around , one extra bite for every man . " O.K. , " he said . " Back to work . " The Humboldt country was west of them , below the dike  --  truck farms , dairy and orchard land . The north-south high  --  way by to the %stem , a half mile from the dike. a king mile or more from the hills they could dimly see through the blowing rain . All morning the highway had been dogged  --  a parade of police and Army vehicles , private trucks and cars . After lunch , only die dump trucks were musing on the roads down there . scooting across the bottom land , bringing sand and sacks to the men who fought the rising river . " Vnutiee , " said Shorty Kniss , forger , " they ai n't in much hurry to get here , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less talk , " Torn Sharkey said . " More work . " The day wore on . The twelve convicts filled and wired and placed the sacks , mov  --  ing heavily . on the river face of the dike . At dusk , a dump truck appeared with a gaso  --  line generator in tow A mechanic climbed out or the cab to show Toni Sharkey how to start the motor and switch on the flood  --  light . " Well need food and drinking water , " Sharkey said . The mechanic said , " I 'll pass the word along . " Darkness came , Torn Sharkey stood in the shadow beside the bellowing generator , watching and counting the tired men . " Truck coming ! " someone yelled . The bag filler , the wire-and-lift learn moved nut the dump area into the full glare of the floodlight where they would stood until the truck had gone . Tom Sharkey 's thumb found the safety button aficsee the rifle 's trigger In eighteen years of service he had never lost a prisoner ; he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward out of the night . hoist squealing " Ask him ! " Kniss yelled . " Where 's the chow ? " " It 'll be here , " Sharkey said . " This truck or next " " Do n't Count on it , " a deep voice said . This was Bruce Donavan , the murderer . He was standing a little apart from the oth  --  ers , hands louse at his sides . He was a tall man , big of shoulder , deep of chest  --  no Rat-bellied beauty . this one . He was Mick . waisted. his heavy torso set on heavy thighs . His hands and feet were big . His face was brown , dirty now . He had a short , straight nose , brown eyes , a stubborn jaw . His muddy rag of shirt was open upon a hair  --  less chest . His pants were rolled to the knee , his feet were bare . " Donavan , " Sharkey said , " where 're your shoes ? " " I took them off . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's getting along to that time . " Now the dump truck jolted to a stop , hoist whining . The tail gate opened and wet sand spilled out . Sharkey left his place be  --  side the generator to ask the driver about food . " 1 would n't know , " the driver said . " I ai n't had nothin ' to eat myself since break  --  fast . " He gunned the motor nervously . " I 'll tell ' ens what you said . " " Do that , " Tom Sharkey said . He stepped back and made a quick count : two men with shovels , two with bags , two who had wads of wire thrust un  --  der their belts . Donavan , the ounderer , standing alone . He was always alone . Be  --  yond Donavan , Peebles , the armed robber , gun and knife specialist , steel-rimmed glasses glinting . Beyond Peebles , Dortch , Avent , Barr and Kniss . Twelve men , all present and accounted for Sharkey lifted an arm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlight glow up the dike . " Move in , " Sharkey said . " Let 's go some more . " He stood beside the generator , back to the driving rail ! Shovels bit into the sand . A sack was filled and dragged along a mud-slick plank , wired shut . Donavan , the mur  --  derer. stepped up out of turn , feet braced , back heat , waiting for the load . The tag guy was a fool for work , you had to give him that . All day he 'd been passing the other packets un the path , doing more , do  --  ing twit- , as much as any other , without complaint . But he was one to watch , a ques  --  tion mark . He 'd done six years of a life sentence , every day of it hard time . He 'd done six seats and had yet to make a friend of another con . " Donavan , " Sharkey said , " I. want to talk to w ou . " " Nest time , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the sand bag on his shoulder , moving easity , without haste . That , too . was Donavan . Any of the others would have jumped at the chance to fall out of line . Not Donavan . The big guy asked no favors , wanted none . " Yes ? " Donavan said . His voice was pitched to carry above the generator 's steady roar . He was standing in the glare of the light , a goad six feet from Tom Sharkey . He had been trained to stand thus when reporting to a guard who held is rifle . He was n't smiling . He rarely smiled , but his eyes could laugh at you . " Why the bare feet ? " Sharkey asked . " I swim better that way . " " Do n't try a dive . I 'm a good wing shot . " " I wo n't have to dive . " " Still cumin ' up , eh ? How fast ? " " Two inches an hour . Maybe three . " " It 'll level off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's time we left . It was time to leave three hours ago . ' ' Half the convict crew were listening now . " We ca n't fill enough sand bags to do any good . " " How do you know so much ? " " I used to build dikes on this river , " Donavan said , " and docks and wing dams and ferry slips . We ca n't save this one  --  the U. S. Army could n't save it now . If you want to get these men hack inside the walls alive , you 'd better put them aboard the nest truck out . " " That 'll do ! " Sharkey said . " That 's enough Donavan , the murderer , turned on his heel . At the sand pile all work had ceased ; the men were listening , rain-wet faces turned to the light . Peebles , the lean , tough thief who 'd specialized in attack from be  --  hind , caught at Donavan 's arm . Donavan brushed his hand away sod bent to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peebles said . He grabbed at a bag not yet wired shut . He got it on his shoulder unaided , and went floundering down the path after Don  --  avan . The others began to move again , slowly , talking among themselves . Tom Sharkey 's thumb found the safety above the rifle 's trigger . It was n't bad enough to be stuck out here without relief , no food , no drinking water they could be sure was safe . Now he had the making of panic on his hands . Donavan dropped the sand bag atop the sloping wall of bags on the river face of the dike , then stood for a moment watching the suck and swirl of muddy water . An  --  other foot  --  two feet , and they were done . " Hey ! " Peebles said . " Hey , Donavan ! " Donavan said , " What do you want ? " " What you said ? " Peebles pushed his mud-smeared glasses up on his fore  --  head . " What you told the gun screw , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him straight ? " " Yes . " Donavan said . " The dike 's gain ' to go , huh ? Kapoot ? " " Yes , " Donavan said . " Great grief ! " The words came at the end of Peebles ' breath . He turned to look back into the blue-white eye of the big floodlight . " He ai n't goin ' to take us out o ' here  --  not without orders ' n ' help , he ai n't . He 'll keep us here . till he 's got another gun Wren ' an ' a motorcycle bull to ride escort . " He wiped his hands on his shirt . " What 're we goin ' to do ? " " I 'm staving . Do whatever you like . " A voice near the generator said , " Hey , look at this ! We got a river inside the dike ! And it 's coming up fast ! " The water inside the dike was not yet a river . It was slack water , fed by seepage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed into minor streams . But it cov  --  ered a wide arra . Out in the dark beyond the reach of their light , much of the flat land to the south and west already lay sub  --  merged , arid in many places the water had covered the north-south highway . There were cars stalled along the highway , most all of them abandoned . A few were still in their ears . Elizabeth Matthew 's and Carl Corbin were two of these . She was twenty-three , a poogradliate student at the university . Her parents and a brother arid sister lived not far from the town of Biddleford . When she 'd heard news reports saying the town of Biddleford was in danger she 'd wanted immediately  --  and senselessly. she knew now  --  to be with her parents . Carl Corbin , nineteen , an under  --  graduate and a family friend , had agreed to drive her home . They 'd come this far , to this depression in the road . Their ear head  --  lights showed them a sheet of still water covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width or depth . " I 'm afraid of it , " Elizabeth said . She scrubbed mist from the windshield and peered past the beating windshield wipers . " In this ink , I ca n't tell if it 's a puddle or a lake . Had n't we better turn back ? " Carl 's young face was twisted in hard thought . He tried to keep his own fear out of his voice . " We ca n't be far from Leban  --  on , " he said . " I 'd guess a mile , maybe two . If we can get there , we 're safe . And even if we get stuck here . I can hike on in and get a tow car . We 'd do better to go ahead than to go back and get stuck in the middle of nowhere . " He rolled the window down and peered into the driving rain , " It does n't look too bad , I think I can see clear road on the other side . " He turned to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're the driver . " " So cross your fingers , " he said . He put the car in low gear and cased it forward into the water . His young face was white and strained . Elizabeth 's hands were clenched in aching fists . " Carl , it 's getting deeper ! " " You 're telling me ! " He knew now the clear road he 'd seen had been imagined . He was committed , and lie was too young to change his mind quickly or willingly . They went on , five yards , ten . The ( Continued on Page 54t 64 ' ( Continued from Page 62 ) motor spa . tered . Frightened , Carl shifted into second quickly and gunned the motor with the hope of bulling through . The motor stut  --  tered and coughed and died . The starter whirred on and on without result . Carl stared through the windshield . " I goofed . " " You tried , " Elizabeth said . " It was a good try , " Carl opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Just like a lake , " he said . He stood up , leaning on the door . holding to the car top . He could see nothing hopeful in the rain-laced darkness . He got back into the car , wiping his drip  --  ping face . " Looks like I go wading . " " Wading where ? " " Down the road . Lcbannon ca n't be LOO far , but there should be help closer than that . A farmer with a truck or something . You 'll be all right here . " " Ca n't I go with you ? " Carl got out of the car . The water was knee-deep . " In this ? " he asked . He but  --  toned his coat against the rain . " Do n't be a dope ! I 'll get wet enough for both of us . " " Do n't be gone long . " " Ten minutes , " he said , " That 's a prom . isc . I 'll find somebody or I 'll come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turn the lights on now and then and toot the horn . It 's as dark as the inside of a goat out here . I do n't want to lose you . " He closed the door and waded away . When he was beyond the reach of the lights , Elizabeth turned them off She waited a few moments , then pulled the switch to turn them on again . They did not come on . And the horn was dead . Pres  --  ently the rising water was covering the floor inside the car . She lifted her feet up to the cushions . Carl did not come bark in ten minutes or in fifteen minutes . And not in a half hour . The rising water drove Elizabeth out of the car . She climbed to the hood , then to the top . Standing in the darkness and the rain , shivering with the cold that soaked through her belted raincoat , she was a very frightened girl . But she tried not to be . She could n't make like a lighthouse . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every moment or two she sent a wailing cry through the night . Tom Sharkey stood beside the roaring generator , the rifle in his hands . He counted convicts , checking names against the roster in his mind . He 'd picked those who were most dependable for the dump-area job of bag filling . Schorcr , a molester. big as art ox and just as dumb , was paired with Wilkes , a wiry stub of a man , a burglar . Witzel , a sneak thief , and Rudiaill , who 'd stripped and stolen cars , worked together . Turnidge , a big , blond kid , another ear thief , was teamed with Regan , a sullen man who 'd burned his neighbors ' barns . The packers , who carried the filled bags , were the men to watch . Tom Sharkey had deliberately given them the mule work ; tired men do n't have the strength to run . Some of them were nearing exhaustion now . Doc Barr , tavern burglar , had slipped and fallen twice . He 'd had trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doc had a wife and daughter in Lebannon , " Pe.arl 'll do all right , " he 'd said . " But Midge  --  she 's just a little bit of a thing ; probably scared to death . " " Who ai n't ? " Shorty Knias had said . Shorty , a grinning ape with a scarred nose , was a forger , is man who got two drinks and started writing checks . Shorty might panic , Sharkey thought , but he 'd be the last to charge the gun . Dortch , a safe man , and Avent , armed robbery , were a different sort . They were prison-wise , old cons ; their muddy faces told nothing of their thoughts . Both were big and strong , capable of almost anything . And there was Peebles , the worst of the lot . He 'd gone the route  --  knife and gun and club . He would n't charge the rifle , but he 'd be happy to come from behind with shovel , boots and fists , while someone else was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was slippirk and floundering in the wake of Donavan , the murderer , trying desperately to keep up . Tom Sharkey stood with his back against the gas tank of the generator , watching and counting the men . He could hear the voice of the river above the motor 's sound , a kind of subdued and sullen muttering . On the river side of the dike it was within inches of the top , a powerful and ripping current , On the near side it was ten feet lower and still , but rising steadily . There 'd been no car lights south of the truck turnoff for some time now , and the drivers coming down from the north had reported water across sections of the highway in that direction . They were an unhappy lot , those drivers . The intervals between trucks were longer now ; the trucks that came dumped their loads of sand and ran , grata howling , down the dike and away . They brought no food . 1Vorse , they brought no promise of relief . " We 're at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " They 're Irvin ' to save every  --  body they can  --  all the good people . %Vito cares about cons ? " " 11 it 's us , " Doc Barr said , " or a like number of old folks , WOrnen and kids , let it be us . And I say it 's a good swap .... What d' you say , Donavan ? " Donavan said , " I say you 're right . " " Keep moving ! " Tom Sharkey. said . As long as they were here , they would do a job . They kept nosing , but panic and exhaustion had slowed some of them , 1-4.11f the packers were stumbling . Doc Barr fell again , and this time he could not get up until Donavan helped him to his feet . Don  --  avan was naked to the waist , He 'd shed his shirt and somehow ripped the legs of his trousers off , halfway between belt and knee . " Donavan ! " Sharkey said . " How lung'vc we gut ? When Donavan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A truck backed into the dump area , wildly spilling sand . The driver 's face was white , his foot.heavy on die throttle . And a new sound was on the wind , not loud , but rising steadily . Someone in the dump area yelled , " She 's gone ! Look inside ! " Dona  --  van saw water pouring into the lighted area , a roaring wall of water , fast lifting the inside level toward the river level . Gears clashed and the truck lurched away and the headlights found a muddy torrent pouring across the dike . The truck engine howled , the headlights swung and tipped and van  --  ished utterly . Now the dike beneath Donavan 's feet shook and settled , and Wailer poured down the length of it . He heard screams and saw men , arms flailing desperately , stumble and fall and disappear under the water . He could not help them . He was still on his feet , but the shove of the current was hard against his hips , boiling up , building up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sass ' the river take rive more , Wilkes and Turnidge . They rode out of the light , looking fearfully downstream , heads held rigid and high . A third man , Dorsch , went almost willMgly into the water and did not reappear . Peebles ' wild yelling was shrill and thin . ' Hang onto me ! Give Inc a hand ! I ca n't ? " Peebles ' hands clawed at Donavan 's wet and naked back . Donavan 's arm went out to offer support . The current drove Peebles halal against Donavan , rolled hint down the length of Donavan 's ann . Donavan 's reaching hand found only naked flesh and nothing to grip Peebles went under water , then emerged downstream , paddling furi  --  ously , riding high . Again the earth was cut from beneath Donavan , Now there were no inside and outside water levels ; the two levels had met , becoming one , and the dike was slowly melting under it . Donavan staggered , but found new footing , bare feet braced against the coarse saaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . He turned to put the plane of his chest against the stream . There had been no one left on the melting dike downstream . Now , with the light he had , he could see only Torn Sharkey above . The guard had managed what the oth  --  ers could not because the bulk of the gen  --  erator was breaking the full strength of the current , giving him a boiling eddy to stand in , an anchor to cling to . His rifle was gone . He 'd stripped off his raincoat and shirt , and he 'd shed his boots . He was ready . The generator settled , tipping the light to a crazy slant , and Sharkey gave himself to the river , splashing out into it in the clumsy way of a man who can swim only a little . He passed beyond Donavan 's reach . His bald head was awash , sinking and ris  --  ing . There was no cry from him , no show of fear . Now Donavan was alone . He stayed on , his leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiling up from his chest , drenching his face . He was not going to escape . Donavan , the murderer , was going to stay where the guard had left him until he was overpowered by the river . The gen  --  erator gave way at last . The light wheeled across the rain-laced darkness , the motor roared and died and the light was gone , Donavan 's feet began to slide . He had time to face downstream to fill his lungs . He had to go , and he went as any man would go toward freedom . He dived with a powerful thrust that carried him very deep into the river and very far . He did n't try to surface . He let the water have its way with him , tossing him , twisting him , buffeting him in a turmoil of conflict  --  ing currents . The depths of the river , even turbulent and dark , were like home to him . He had been born beside this river . He knew its every mood and feared none of them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thick-waisted body was as buoyant as seasoned wood , the capacity of his lungs was enormous . And he could swim as few men can . He surfaced and rode the crest . With no effort at all , he floated high , his head and part of his shoulders free . The driving rain , the occasional slap of water that struck his face did not bother him at all . Nor did the cold . In hours it might numb him danger  --  ously ; now he was only a little less than comfortable . lie was free ! That was the thing that mattered . Downstream , perhaps a hundred miles , was the town of %Vest Mills . He 'd lived and worked there . And he 'd been tried for murder them , found guilty and sentenced to prison . Since the day they 'd taken him from West Mills , handcuffed and shackled , he 'd wanted no other thing than to go back . And now Ire was going back . The river had done for him what he 'd refused to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it carried him toward West Mills , it was protecting him with its wide readies and with the confusion of the disaster it was working , Still more , it was holding in store for him  --  for the time after West Mills  --  complete oblivion . Who could say that Donavan had not died in the flood ? And who could say , after the flood had gone , that Donavan did not lie buried in the muck and silt , along with a hundred others . All he had to do was man  --  age the business in West Mills carefully , and , after it , walk carefully through the confusion and OM of the confusion to a dis  --  tant place , a new ' identity and a free life . But the business in West Mills and what  --  ever was to happen beyond %Vest Mills were things lie could not hurry . The way was clear , the means would come to hand at the proper time .

Continued en Page68 ) ( Continued taunt Page 114 ) And he laughed at that , full-throated laughter- he had n't known ill years . He dived again , go  --  ing deep , then drove himself up to break the SlItilee in a porpoise roll and dived again . He swain far beneath the surface , adding his speed to the swift current , following its twist  --  ing , unseen pathways , recoiling as it re  --  coiled ; then going up with the sudden rush of it to break the surface in the center of a wide upheaval . A free man I By the living God and all the saints men pray to  --  at last , a free man ! Of the other convicts , only Peebles was still alive , a half mile ahead of Donavan , east of him . Peebles ' small , stringy body was tough-libered , his will to live was inde  --  structible . He paddled clumsily . but furi  --  ously , keeping himself afloat long after big  --  ger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give up , he would not die . And his endless fighting paid off for him . In time , an uprooted tree came to his hands . He fastened to it like a hall-drowned cat . Riding the tree , exuberance came to him too . He knew he would live now . And he was free . Being alive and free in a flood so vast would Ise no bad thing , he knew . A man with a gun , a knife or even a club and the know-how to use it could n't help but score big . Houses would stand vacant . Vs'hole towns would be empty . And almost all those he mei would be carrying what they could of their valuables . It would all be free  --  free because the flood would cover whatever he had to du tu take it . Torn Sharkey- , the guard , was still alive . A far diflerrnt man than Peebles . he had much the same inflexible will to stay alive . His fight w ire the river was a carefully con  --  trolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miser 's care . He reasoned : each undertow had to return him to the surface in time : a deep breath ssould sustain him . if he did n't struggle needlessly ; his awkward swimming stroke would support him , if he did n't ask too much of it . But there was nothing like exuberance in him . There was only a grim determination to stay alive somehow . To stay alive . be  --  cause Tom Sharkey. sergeant , the guard who 'd never lost a man , had lust twelve men at one stroke . Some of the twelve had died , he knew . But if he lived , some of the twelve would live with him . And those who lived had to go  --  would go  --  Bark to prison . Sharkey , Peebles and Donavan were widely separated . But they had entered the water at the same point . They were being carried by the same currents . Because the currents were treating each man alike , they were going , unknown to one amnia. / , toward the same general destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river . He knew that , feeling the push of the river slacken as it would upon spreading out across submerged flat lands . Then he be  --  gan to encounter still-standing trees in the darkness , brush that spoke of fence rows . Still he made no effort to choose a course and stay on it . In this darkness , one way was as good as anothet " . so long as the gen  --  eral direction was toward the south . He came upon the north-south highway in a little while . His first hint of it was when he felt the graveled shoulder beneath his feet . He waded to the pavement and found the water flowing there only a lit  --  tle more than knee deep . He was resting there when he heard Elizabeth Matthews ' The sound was faint in the drumming rain , dreary and forlorn , as any imitation of a foghorn must be , but unmistakably hu  --  man and female . Donavan did not go to  --  ward the sound at once . He could n't bring himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swore at that . I-k had n't time to help anyone . He could n't safely help any ? one . Worse  --  this was a bitter discovery to him  --  he had no desire to help . Why should he help one of the people who had kept him caged the past six years ? %%thy should he help anyone at all ? lie fought with himself and lost . He waded on , his anger and his disappoint  --  ment an ugly taste in his mouth . When he was near enough , he called , " Hello  --  hello there ! " Elizabeth answered at once , " Hello ! Hello ! " There was doubt in her voice , fear that her ears had tricked her . He called again , and Elizabeth knew a gladness and a relief that made her almost senseless . " Yes  --  yes , I 'm here ! Oh , thank God ! Help me , help me ! I 'd given op hope ! I ? " " Steady , " Donavan said . " I 'll be right with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water deepened again and the current began tugging at his legs . Her voice guided him to the car , and he stood beside it waist-deep in the boil on the downsucam side . He could n't sec her in the rain and the darkness , nor could she see him . " Are you alone ? " she asked . " Alone , " he said . " Walking and swim  --  ming . Well , you 'd better come down . You ca n't stay up there . " " But the water 's deep . The current ? " " Deep and getting deeper , " Donavan said quietly . " The dikes have given way upstream . It 's taking a while to cover the flat lands , but they 'll be covered by ten feet or more . You 'll have to get into the water . It might as well be now . " " No . I ca n't ! " Donavan moved close to the car . Reach  --  ing up , fumbling in the darkness , his big hand found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she came tum  --  bling , screaming , down on top of him . He caught her weight on his shoulder . She fought him wildly , but he forced her legs down into the cold water between himself and the car , to her knees , her thighs , her waist , until her feet were on the pavement . The shock of the chill water stopped her outcries . She could only gasp . " You 'll be all right , " he told her , " The water 's cold , but you 'll get used to il . Nose stop fighting . Stop fighting the water and stop fighting me . Get hold of yourself ; you ca n't stay alive if you do n't . " Her arms were tight around his neck . She was clinging to him desperately , pressed hard against his naked chest . Now , as the first shock passed , she found that nothing harmful had happened , and began to think again . The quiet voice of the man who held her was completely unafraid , com  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arms were very strong . Her courage came back to her . " I-1 lost my head . " " It 's all right , - he said . " And you 're go  --  ing to be all right . But you 've got to trust me and do what I say to do . We ca n't stay here . The water 's rising . We 'll have to swim . " " The highway ? Ca n't we walk ? " " All of the highway is under , " he said . " It will be deep under soon . And we ca n't waste our strength fighting the river . We can only win if we let it carry us along . " He brought his face close to hers , trying to see something of it . He could see only a pale , indefinite outline . " It will help if I know a little something about you , " he said . " How old ate you ? " " Twenty-three . " " Arc you in good health ? Arc you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim ? " " I can swim and dive as well as most MIMI ! 11 , I guess . But I 'm not a champion . " " You do n't need to be , " Donavan said . " Pm champion enough for both of us . That 's a truth . Believe it , so you wo n't panic . I can swim twenty miles without leaving the water . I have , more than once . When we leave here , we 'll let this current take us wherever it will until we find shelter of some kind . " " What can we find in this dark ? " " Perhaps nothing , " he said . " Then we 'll go on until daylight . Hold still now . " He ran his hands over her shoulder , down her waist , over her hips and down to her feet . " You 'll have to get out of some of those clothes . Your coat , your dress , your girdle , shoes and stockings . Save your slip , if you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And save me your coat belt . " She was silent , unmoving . He said , " Your modesty speaks well for you , but your judgment is faulty . Wet clothes wo n't keep you warm . Wet , they 'll pull you down , tangle your arms and legs and catch on things . " He waited a mo  --  ment . Then he said , " Your modesty may kill you ; half naked you 're sure to live  --  it 's your choice . " " Here 's my coat belt , " she said . He held the belt of her raincoat in his teeth . He helped her remove her coat . As she lifted her dress and slip , he stripped them off her , over her head . He made the slip into a rope and tied it around her waist . In the turbulence , her wet girdle proved more than site could manage alone ; he helped her with that , and with her shoes and stockings . " Now give me your wrist , " he said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist . Then he fashioned a loop in the other end , ran it above the biceps of his right arm , drew it tight . " It 's not a tuts ' rope , " he said , " It 's to keep me from losing you in the dark . You 'll ride with your hinds on my shoulders . Let ore do the swimming . Float as shallowly as you can straight behind me ; I 'll take the worst of the brush and the fences . All right ? " " I 'll tr , ? . " " Good girl . Now let 's be on our way , " He took her hand in his and drew her away from the sheltering eddy beside the car , toward the roadside ditch , She felt him dropping into deeper water , felt the stronger currents dragging at her legs , and fear caught her again . " Ca n't we stay on the highway ? Please ! " " No ! " He was chest deep , fighting the current . " I know this road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . The water will drive us from the road , and I 'd rather leave it where there 's a channel cut . The deep water is the safest . " He pulled her hand . She had no choice but to go to him into the deeper water . She gasped as the coldness of it covered her en  --  tire body , and began swimming , reaching for him . He turned in her clutching arms , guided her hands to his shoulders . He shoved off , riding high to clear the roadside fence , and let the current take them where it would . After the first moments of terror and un  --  certainty , Elizabeth was able to control her fear again . No fear was communicated to her from the man beneath her hands . He was able to keep them both afloat with only the smallest movements , and when there was need for swimming , his powerful breast stroke carried them in almost any direction he chose . This was still the greatest hardship she 'd ever known . While she became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never has than just bearable , and , as time went on , it streamed to penetrate to her bones . They rode torrents that were almost cataracts , dipping and rising on rolling waves . Gouts of water struck her face endlessly , choking her . Occasionally the wailer became still , shallowing to hip-deep and knee-deep , and they waded . ( Continued on Page 72 ) ( Continued from Page 68 ) The rain beating on her naked shoulders seemed to warm her , and the return to the cold of the deep water was greater torment . There were a few small areas of ground above water . When they stumbled on one of these , Donavan would let her rest a little , but no matter how hard she protested , he would never let her stay . " You ca n't stay , " he told her , his voice quiet , impersonal and patient . " This ground will be under in a little while . But even if it were n't going to be , we 'd have to go on until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cold for long . Too much ex  --  posure will kill you . We 'll find something soon . " He had to drag her by force from that high ground . On the next , he heard a sound that gave her new strength . " Hear it , girl ? " he asked . " That 's cattle bawling . We 're on or near a farm . There must be buildings -- a barn , a house , a shed . " They went on , wading . The water was quiet , no deeper than their hips , and the land was level . But it had been a grain field , well grown before the flood had come , and the grasslike stalks , standing loose and free under the water , caught at their bare arms and legs like thousands of tentacles . Each stride was enormously difficult . The last of Elizabeth 's strength was drained from her . She fell , got up and went on , and fell again , and got up and fell and could n't get up . Donavan took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended that field . Beyond it , un  --  even mud beneath his feet told him he was in a lane much used by livestock . He paused a moment , listening to the still-distant bawling of the cattle , thinking . Then he fol  --  lowed the lane in a direction away from the sound of the cattle . In a little more than a hundred yards , lie came to a wide wooden gate , a barnyard gate , standing open . He crossed the barnyard to another fence and followed the fence to another gate . This gate was dosed , but easily opened , and there was a brick path that led to a house . Donavan climbed two steps to a porch that was knee-deep under the water . He put Elizabeth on her feet and held her . " Are you all right ? " he said . " Can you stand alone ? " " I  --  I think Yes . Where are we ? " " We 've found a house . " " But there 's no light . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope the owners got away ahead of the flood . The water 's a foot deep over the floor now , and climbing . " He took the loop of the raincoat belt from his arm . " I 'll see what we 've got here . " They had a farmhouse , old and not very large . A kitchen  --  they entered through the back door  --  a dining room , a living room and an old-fashioned parlor . These things Donavan discovered , wading and groping through the darkness , running his hands over furniture that still stood on the floors . " We 're in luck , " he said . " I ca n't find a bedroom on this floor . That means we 've got two floors with bedrooms above . Stand Cast until I find the stairs . " Elizabeth waited in the darkness by the kitchen doorway . She was sagging with exhaustion , but far worse was the cold . Now it had penetrated to every part of her . Her jaws were chattering , her body ached , her mind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the stairs , but she could n't answer or go to him . He Caine to her . The ' first touch of his hands on her flesh told him what the trouble was . He lifted her in his arms and carried her . He found a bedroom upstairs and a bed with coverings . He stood her beside it , " Strip , " he said . " Strip to the buff and wait . I 'll go look for towels . " She was stripped and in bed , shivering miserably and sick beyond caring , when he returned . His groping hands found her . " I told you to wait , " he said , without anger . " But it 's all right . There 's another bed . " Thc blankets and sheet were pulled from her , a thick bath towel dropped across her breast . Another towel , enclosing his big hands , began to rub her feet and legs . His hands were rough , vigorous and insistent , but somehow they did n't hurt her . And they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . impersonally , until they had brought warmth and circulation to every part of her body . He swung her feet to the floor then , found her wrist and drew her up . " Come on  --  into a dry bed . " He led her to another bedroom and another bed . He held the covers open for her , guided her under them and tucked her in . " I 'll see if I can find pajamas or a nightgown . " He went away and came back . " No luck . You 'll have to make do . Would another blanket help ? " " I 'll be all right . " " Good girl . If you begin to chill again , call me . I think we can beat it with mas  --  sage . At least , we can try . " She was silent for a moment . Then : " I wish I could see you . " " Why ? " " So I could thank you , " she said . " I ca n't thank just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give me your hand . " Her hand found his and she gripped it , " Thanks  --  so much . " " I deserve no thanks , " he said . " None at all . " She heard him turn away . " Rest now  --  sleep . I 'll be near . "
