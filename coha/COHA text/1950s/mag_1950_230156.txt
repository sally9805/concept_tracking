Back in 1912 President Taft sent a young Iowa-born accountant to Nicaragua to help collect customs payments and make sure that some of the money went to service foreign debts . In the unabashed days of dollar diplomacy , that was one way the U.S. saw to it that a troubled Caribbean republic 's obligations were met . At his rolltop desk in a musty corner of the wood-and-adobe Managua customhouse , Irving A. Lindberg did an honest and efficient job . More important , as the years passed , he made friends with a rising young National Guard officer named Anastasio ( " Tacho " ) Somoza . <P> The U.S. Marines , who went in as early as 1910 to pacify the country , finally cleared out for good in 1933 . Three years later , Somoza took over . Lindberg stayed on as his collector of customs and Nicaragua 's credit strengthened steadily . Lindberg got $10,000 a year , living expenses , one of the best houses in Managua , and two months ' vacation in the U.S. each year . No man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator 's all-night poker parties . But in 1944 , when a sit-down strike of businessmen threatened Somoza 's power , Lindberg came to Tacho 's aid by declaring that no striking shop owner would get any dollars for imports . <P> Time for a Reckoning . Tacho gave him the presidential medal , appointed him an honorary cabinet member , and promoted him to general , a rank previously held only by himself . " If you 're the only other general in the country , " Tacho is supposed to have said when pinning on the stars , " I 'm safe . " <P> Lindberg loved his new uniform . He also loved publicity and took to giving interviews freely to visiting newsmen . His stateside trips grew longer until they lasted as long as half a year . Politicos , whose mouths had watered for years at the thought of the $5,000,000 annual customs traffic , growled that it was time for a reckoning with the deplorably high-minded , highhanded yanqui . <P> Time for a Trip . Suave Finance Minister Leon Debayle wrote Lindberg asking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget . Lind-berg 's reply was short on details . " I want to know about those dollars , " cried Debayle righteously . Managua 's press joined in the hue &; cry . <P> Last week , while 62-year-old Irving " Lindberg visited the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. for a checkup and surgery , government accountants were going over the customs books . " Lindy 's my friend , " said Dictator Tacho . " I do n't think there 's anything wrong with his accounts . But Lindy 's getting old . " It looked very much as though the last survivor of the U.S. occupation was on his way out .
