Professor Charles E. Merriam , a political scientist who wanted to reform Chicago , ran for mayor in 1911 and lost . Years later , he was strolling with his wife Hilda in her home town , Constableville , N.Y. , when they passed an old barn . She remarked casually : " My grandfather used to own a brewery in that building . ' ' The professor , who had been defeated by politicians weaned on beer , all but shouted : " A brewery ! If I 'd known that , I could have been mayor of Chicago ! " This year the professor 's son Robert could likewise have used a brewery . He , too , is a political scientist ; he , too , wanted to reform Chicago ; he , too , ran for mayor , and last week he , too , was defeated by Chicago 's preference for its regular beery , cheery brand of politics . The winner , as usual : Chicago 's Democratic machine . <P> Wrong Looks . Young Robert Merriam , 36 , was handicapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago image of an Ivy Leaguer . He pleaded with reporters not to call him reformer , a prejudicial word in Chicago . " You know what the party workers say ? " he complained . " They say to each other , ' Have you ever seen this Merriam take a drink ? Does he ever drink ? I mean , have you actually seen him take a drink ? ' " ( Some people have . ) <P> A Democrat until last year , Merriam ran this year as a Republican , and ran hard . He put on a daily five-minute TV show , raced around in a Chevrolet equipped with radio-telephone for campaign calls and an electric razor for touch-up shaves . At endless campaign gatherings he breakfasted on bagels and lox , dined on corned beef and cabbage , sipped coffee late into the night . Once he walked into a South Side revival meeting just as a writhing , frenzied woman was carried out . " Say what you got to say , " the minister told him . " Do it in five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Right Levers . By contrast , Democrat Richard Daley , 52 , talked like a stockyard lad who made good ( which he is ) and looked like a model for the modern machine politician ( which he also is ) . He had the support of Adlai Stevenson , Senator Paul Douglas and Hearst 's Chicago American . Every day , after breakfast with his wife and children , he went campaigning with a baby-blue Cadillac and great dignity ( " as a good father , good neighbor and good citizen " ) . That was good enough . On election day Democrat Daley won by 126,667 votes ( out of 1,342,993 cast ) , the machine 's smallest victory margin since 1943. * <P> Leading the ticket was Morris B. Sachs , South Side garment merchant and local TV impresario ( Sacks ' Amateur Hour ) , who ran for city treasurer . In the Democratic primary , Morris Sachs went down to defeat with outgoing Mayor Martin Kennelly , wept in Kennelly 's arms while cameras recorded his sorrow ( TIME , March 7 ) . Sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the organization 's ticket . In campaign speeches he recalled fondly : " I sold Dick Daley 's mother the first pair of long pants for Dick . Without me , where would he be ? " His reward : 737,169 votes and more pictures in the papers , this time grinning happily alongside Daley.
