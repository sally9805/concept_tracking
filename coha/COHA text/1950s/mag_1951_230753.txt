The Lady Pays Off ( Universal-International ) proceeds from the doubtful premise that voluptuous Linda Darnell , a famed U.S. schoolteacher who has adorned the cover of TIME , can not get men interested in her for her own sake . They think of her only as a companion for their kids . <P> Linda hustles off to a Reno vacation in search of romance . She loses $10,000 to Stephen McNally , owner of a gambling casino , who offers to swap her I.O.U . for a summer of tutoring for his little girl ( Gigi Perreau ) . Linda reluctantly agrees , protesting so much that it takes no cinema connoisseur to see that her annoyance will soon blossom into love . <P> What little fun this frail comedy offers comes not from its hard-working principals but from two supporting players : Virginia Field , playing a flip , catty blonde who exchanges hisses with Linda over McNally , and Nestor Paiva as the Mexican owner of a broken-down fishing smack , who takes a gleefully perverse delight in his own misfortunes . <P> Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comedy , but the joke is on Claudette Colbert . Last year a back injury kept her from playing the Bette Davis role in All About Eve ; she has filled her commitment to 20th Century-Fox in Let 's Make It Legal . The injury turns out to have put her in double jeopardy by shifting her from 1950-3 best comedy to one of 1951 'S worst . The film also traps Macdonald Carey and Zachary Scott in a dreary mishmash about a man wooing his wife all over again against the deadline of their divorce decree and the competition of her old rich beau .
