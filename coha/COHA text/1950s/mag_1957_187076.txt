Out of the southern Algerian garrison town of Colomb-Bchar one morning last week crept a strange train on an expensive errand . Its locomotive , heavily armored , was preceded by six freight cars loaded with sandbags . Its average speed on its way to Ain-Sefra , another garrison town 170 miles to the northeast , was a hesitant 13 m.p.h . Whenever it reached a bridge , invariably a bridge thrown up temporarily by French Army engineers-it slowed down to a walk . <P> Slow and unprepossessing as it was , the Colomb-Bchar-Ain-Sefra Express was a valiant symbol of what Frenchmen like to call " the French presence " in Algeria . Conceived by Napoleon III and completed under the supervision of Marshal Louis Lyautey , greatest of France 's North African proconsuls , the Colomb-Bchar-Ain-Sefra line is the southernmost portion of a railroad that runs all the way from the Mediterranean port of Oran to the rim of the Sahara . <P> Nine months ago Algeria 's rebels set out to destroy this iron limb of French imperialism . Basing themselves in newly independent Morocco-at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of Moroccan territory - the guerrillas slipped into Algeria by night , laying mines , blowing up bridges and ripping up track . By last week they had blown up all of the line 's 116 permanent bridges , destroyed 40 freight cars and six electric engines . <P> Under this bombardment , the train 's former passengers have taken to flying , and the coal once carried to Oran from the mines of Colomb-Bchar is now diverted by way of Morocco . But for the prestige-conscious French , the train must chuff on . Once a week it sets forth from Colomb-Bchar , but only after two regiments of Foreign Legionnaires and Senegalese have inspected every inch of the line . <P> Since the rebels are capable of ripping up a mile or more of track in a single night , the train sometimes has to turn back despite all precautions . And so far , French attempts to ambush the guerrillas a-t work have been generally unsuccessful . Disappointing , too , is the radar system which the French set up to catch the guerrillas ' movements . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a French officer last week . " Unfortunately , it works just as well against goats and gazelles . " <P> The rebel force harrying the Colomb-Bchar Express is only one of a number of Algerian guerrilla bands which have long operated in and out of neighboring Morocco and Tunisia . Last week on Algeria 's eastern border , a patrol of the French Army 's 26th Motorized Infantry Regiment , ambushed by a small band of Algerian guerrillas , chased its attackers 300 yards inside Tunisia . When Tunisian troops tried to intervene , the French killed six Tunisians as well as six Algerians . In response to an indignant protest from the Tunisian government , French Commander in Chief in Algeria , General Raoul Salan ( who once commanded the troops that lost Indo-China ) , coldly announced that henceforth his troops would exercise " the lawful right " of hot pursuit .
