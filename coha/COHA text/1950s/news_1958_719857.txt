" There was every evidence that Cairo was as startled by news of the coup as was the rest of the world . Jubilation swept through the crowds in the streets and among workers and the masses of Egyptians who support President Nasser . The official Cairo radio commented that the coup had sounded the death knell for " imperialism " in the Middle East . Officer Is Premier The coup was led by an obscure army officer , Brig . Abdul Karim el-Kassem , who immediately proclaimed himself Premier and Defense Minister .

Hussein Imperiled However , the coup in Iraq put Hussein 's throne in critical periL The Iraqi coup also gave an extraordinary shot in the arm to rebels in Lebanon just at the time when they were reported considering accepting a compromise that would end the crisis in that strife-tom country .

In diplomatic circles and among officials in Cairo there wa:s general speculation  --  and some apprehension ? as to how Britain would react to this crushing blow to one of the West 's last bastions of influence and defense in the Middle East . Britain is the only non-Moslem member of the Baghdad Pact . Iraq is one of the major producers of oil for Western Europe . Any threat to operations of the British-controlled Iraqi Petroleum Company would have grave consequences . Responsible observers believed tat Britain 's build-up of troops in Cyprus , liacluding crack parachute units , may have been in preparation for such eventuality as occurred today in Iraq , rather than as a move toward possible intervention in Lebanon . For more than a month diplomats and observers in Iraq have been reporting growing unrest and signs of an impending explo-siOn among the masses against the as-Said Government .

He named a Cabinet with himself as head . He immediately put about thirty top army officers on pension and announced a major reshuffle in the armed forces . The Baghdad radio also said that an order had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Chamoun Government . This was the first time anyone had heard that there were Iraqi troops in Lebanon . It was believed this may have been a mere propaganda measure . The Baghdad radio continued throughout the day to announce decrees and admonish the people to remain calm and ' not to molest foreigners or attack foreign missions or institutions . Between inflammatory speeches by leaders of the coup , the ra dio was playing Egyptian patriotic songs and marching music . Effectiveness Unknown Because of the shutdown of all other communications with Baghdad , a cloud of ' doubt was raised as to how complete was the rebels " control .
