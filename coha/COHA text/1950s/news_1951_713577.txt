txt The Government froze wages , salaries and other compensation of employes today for the second time in less than nine years . The rates of the freeze are those paid yesterday and those rates may not be increasea without Government approval . Temporarily the freeze is absolute , but . the Wage Stabilization Board expects to have ready by Monday or Tuesday a policy whereby inequities of various kinds may be adjusted . The effect of the order is to bring to a standstill hundreds of collective bargaining negotiations throughout the country . Even wage increases already negotiated but not in effect are blocked by the order . These include the $1.60-a-day increase won by more than 400,000 bituminous and anthracite mine workers . These increases were to go into effect Feb. 1 . Violations are punishable under the Defense Production Act , with penalties ranging up to a fine of $10,000 or a year 's imprisonment , or both . Basic Provision of Order The basic provision of the order reads : " No employer shall pay any employe and no employe shall receive ' wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of the rate at which such employe was compensated on Jan. 25 , 1951 , without the prior approval or authority of the Wage Stabilization Board . " New employes shall not be compensated at rates higher than those in effect on Jan. 25 , 1951 , for the jobs for which they are hired . " Eric Johnston , Economic Stabilization Administrator , authorized the wage freeze order despite // the refusal of some members of the Wage Stabilization Board to sign it . Mr. Johnston did not appear at the news conference where the announcement was made . Cyrus S. Ching , chairman of the W. S. B. , read the order , which , he said , had been handed to ! dm a few minutes earlier . The authority given to the board by the order is extraordinarily broad . It says : " This regulation may be modified , amended or superseded by orders or regulations hereafter issued by the Wage Stabilization Board . " Mr. Ching told reporters : " I just received this order . We have a responsibility to stabilize wages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making a contribu ? tion to production . All those factors will be taken into consideration . " He said that he had a crew of experts at work tailoring formulas to fit the diverse problems resulting from the Government 's intervention in free collective bargaining . The formulas will permit wage increases in some circumstances . The law does not deal with wage controls in terms of a freeze or ceilings . It says that wages shall be " stabilized . " One part of the stabilization policy , for example , probably will cover cost-of-living increases , as the Little Steel formula did in World War II . It will take care of those workers whose wages or salaries have lagged . There also will be provisions to correct " in-plant " inequities so that merit increases , length-of-service increases , promotions , reclassifications and so on may proceed normally . Inter-plant inequities and substandards also will be covered , it is expected , and perhaps some provision will be made for adjustments necessary to divert labor to the most essential defense plants . Whether the stabilization policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite tonight . " Escalator " clauses in union contracts provide for automatic wage adjustments geared to the Federal Consumers Price Index . The major contracts containing escalator clauses , such as those in the automobile industry , do not provide for any further adjustments before March 1 . The order provides relief for employes who may be caught by unusually low wage rates for seasonal or other causes . It says that nothing shall be construed to require the stabilization of rates below those paid during the period from May 24 , 1950 , to June 24 , 1950 . That is the period immediately preceding the Korean fighting . Some parts of the stabilization policy probably will be self-interpreting , but thousands of petitions for approval of adjustments probably will start pouring into the board . Regional boards of labor , industry and public members will be set up to interpret and apply the policy . A large number of disputes is regarded as inevitable . How long the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service will continue to handle labor-management disputes involving wage stabilization problems remains to be determined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage adjustments where there is agreement by the employer and employe
