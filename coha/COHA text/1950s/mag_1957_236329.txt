One hundred years ago next month , a small force of intrepid Englishmen stormed into the sprawling Red Fort of Old Delhi and thereby broke the back of what the British still call the Indian Mutiny . ( Some Indians now call it the " First War of Independence . " ) Last week , as the Republic of India celebrated its tenth Independence Day , Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru spoke to his people from the Red Fort 's symbolic ramparts . Said he : " We have completed one journey of freedom . The second is just to begin . We have to understand that we may stumble and fall . When a people march forward , they are bound to stumble . But we have gone forward in this way . " <P> Nehru spoke the simple truth . Out of the bloody communal riots which racked India in August 1947 has emerged a vast secular state in which 320 million Hindus and 40 million Moslems live in relative peace . Against all the predictions of the Blimps , and the warning of Winston Churchill that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Indian democracy has survived to hold the world 's two largest free elections ; and against the immensity of its problems , even to have survived was triumph . <P> Fees &; Famine . Yet India 's tenth anniversary was celebrated amid what the Times of India calls " an accelerating volume of discontent . " Less than two hours after the Prime Minister 's Delhi speech , 2,000 students , angered by a 50% increase in their tuition fees , ran riot in the pink , princely city of Jaipur , breaking shop windows and setting fires as they went . In subtropical Assam thousands boycotted the Independence Day celebrations in their wrath over a government announcement that a new refinery to process Assamese oil might be built outside Assam . <P> More serious still was the fact that in many parts of India famine was abroad and inflation mounting . And in their efforts to ease India 's economic woes and weaknesses , the nation 's planners had brought forth a second five-year plan so overambitious that it was rapidly exhausting India 's sterling balance in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , the government has been obliged to lower the legal minimum sterling backing for India 's currency from $840 million to $630 million . <P> Failing Magic . The heart of the difficulty was that independence had unleashed popular desires that outran the nation 's capabilities . And out of the frustration came a steady pressure for the quicker techniques of totalitarianism . Kerala State on the Malabar Coast has already elected a Communist administration ; a Communist-Socialist coalition rules the city of Bombay . Fortnight ago , faced with a nationwide strike of postal and telegraph workers that might spread to 400,000 government employees , Nehru himself rushed through Parliament a bill outlawing strikes in " essential industries . " <P> Characteristically , Nehru accompanied this strong-handed tactic with a promise to give the workers a retroactive pay raise if study showed that one was justified . More and more , Nehru 's once irresistible prestige works its magic only if he concedes his opponents what they want .                    @
