" One of the most irresponsible pieces of serious legislation reported by a committee to the Senate since I have been a member , " said Missouri 's Democratic Senator Thomas C. Hennings Jr . Not so , retorted South Carolina 's Democratic Senator Olin Johnston : It is a landmark defense against a Supreme Court which has made a " shambles of established , ingrained law . " <P> Both Hennings and Johnston were talking about a bill originally authored by Indiana 's Republican Senator William Jenner , rewritten almost completely by Maryland 's Republican Senator John Marshall Butler , and approved last week-without hearings-by a 10-to-5 vote of the Senate Judiciary Committee . Aimed at providing legislative remedy for recent Supreme Court decisions in the field of national security , the Jenner-Butler bill is certain to be hotly disputed . Its main points : <P> State rules for admission to the bar should not be subject to review by the Supreme Court . This stems directly from the Supreme Court decisions last year in the cases of New Mexico Lawyer Rudolph Schware , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership , and of California Lawyer Raphael Konigsberg , who was refused admission to the bar because he refused to answer questions about past Communist associations . The court ordered a license issued to Schware and that Konigsberg be admitted to the bar . <P> Congressional committees , by majority vote , should become the final judges of whether their questions to witnesses are pertinent to a valid legislative purpose . This is in reply to last year 's Supreme Court decision reversing the contempt-of-Congress conviction of United Auto Workers Organizer John Watkins , who had refused to identify past Communist associates to the House Un-American Activities Committee . The court held that Watkins had been denied due process because he had no way of knowing whether the committee 's questions were actually pertinent to a valid legislative purpose . <P> Unless specifically stated , no act of Congress would preempt state laws in the same field . This is in answer to the 1956 Supreme Court decision in the case of Pennsylvania Communist Leader Steve Nelson , who had been convicted under a state antisedition law . The court held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superseded all state laws dealing with subversive activities against the U.S. <P> The antisubversion Smith Act should be expanded to make a criminal offense of the mere teaching of advocacy of violent overthrow of the U.S. This provision , which would doubtless face stern constitutional testing as to whether it violated the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech , is an attempt to answer the Supreme Court for reversing the Smith Act convictions of 14 California Communists . The court last year held that the Smith Act did not cover the " abstract doctrine " of violent overthrow , but only the " teaching and advocacy of action in language reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite persons to such action .
