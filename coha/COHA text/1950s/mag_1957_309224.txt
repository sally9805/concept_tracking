Britain 's good grey BBC , stiffly challenged by commercial TV , has been denying for months that it plans to cater to anything so vulgar as popular taste . Its critics have seen the taint of the common touch in the BBC 's decision to accent TV while lopping two hours daily off the five-hour highbrow Third Program . But last week they could take heart in a new appointment . As chairman of its board of governors with complete control over all radio and TV programs , the BBC named Rugby Headmaster Sir Arthur fforde , 56 , who does not own a TV set and seldom listens to the radio . <P> Sir Arthur was a solicitor and civil-service administrator before he took over Rugby nine years ago . Asked about his views on rock ' n ' roll , he said : " I know nothing about it , but I 'm prepared to study . " As to the Third Program cuts , he had reassuring words : " I was somewhat appalled when I heard the BBC were cutting it down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change may not be as catastrophic as was first supposed . " The BBC stands ready to remedy its new boss 's lack of a TV set when he takes over in January . Said a spokesman : " We will install one free in his office and also in his home if he desires . "
