txt The French National Assembly has given Premier Pierre Mendes-France a vote of confidence-310 to 172 ? on his Indochina policies , thus clearing the way for a four-day debate on German rearmament . The number of the Premier 's supporters was sharply reduced , however , from his total on previous votes of confidence since he took office six months ago . On Aug. 10 , he won a confidence vote on large special economic powers , 361 to 90 , with 143 abstentions . On Oct. 12 , he was again voted confidence on the the conclusion of the London accords by a count of 350 to 113 , with 152 abstentions . In another vote , on Nov. 9 , M. MendesFrance said he would consider the result an expression of confidence but did not make it a formal vote to that effect . That was on a minor budget question , refusing wage increases to postal workers . He won , 321 to 207 , with 100 abstentions . Paul-Henri Teitgen , speaking Dec. 20 for the ( Roman Catholic ) Popular Republican Movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRP was taking this attitude " so that the great debate on foreign policy should not be delayed . " He pointedly said the decision to abstain " signifies defiance . " Many deputies who seek to overthrow the Premier wanted to wait for the approval first of the Paris treaties to rearm West Germany and admit it to the Atlantic Pact , return sovereignty to West Germany , and put the disputed Saar Valley under the proposed seven-nation Western European Union . These opponents of the Premier feel the responsibility for ratification of German rearmament might turn out to be a political millstone that could keep him out of power permanently . The 627-member Assembly accepted M. Mendes-France as Premier last June by a 419-47 vote and approved the Indochina peace he concluded at Geneva a month later 462-13.
