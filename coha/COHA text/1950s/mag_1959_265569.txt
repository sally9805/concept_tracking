The intake of a jet engine is like an unimaginably powerful vacuum cleaner , can snatch surprisingly heavy things right off the runway . Pliers , wrenches , cigarette lighters , coins and nails have all been found in jet innards , and even the least of these can sometimes do serious damage . So far , no jet airliner has suffered engine failure from this cause , but one such disaster would be too many . <P> Last week Ryan Reporter , house organ of Ryan Aeronautical Co. , reported a solution worked out by the Douglas Aircraft Co. for use on the new DC-8 Jetliner . Loose objects on the ground are not inhaled directly by the great flood of air passing through an engine , Douglas engineers found . Instead , a vortex like a small tornado forms below and just ahead of the engine 's intake . If anything loose is within its reach , the vortex lifts it up like a house in a Kansas twister . Then the main air stream grabs it and hurls it into the engine 's maw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverted from the engine 's compressors and shot downward and forward . The air jets hit the runway , blow away the converging air that would feed a vortex . No vortex forms , and indigestible objects stay on the ground .
