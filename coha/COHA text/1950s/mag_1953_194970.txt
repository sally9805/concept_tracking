In Hollywood four months ago , Desi Arnaz sat down in solemn conference with a battery of pressagents , including a man from the sponsor , Philip Morris . Their problem : how to squeeze the maximum of publicity out of the fact that Desi 's wife , Lucille Ball , was going to have two babies - one in real life , the other in their filmed TV show , I Love Lucy ( Mon. 9 p.m. , CBS ) . Suddenly inspiration struck one of the experts . Lucille would have to have her real baby by Caesarean section , would n't she ? Then the date on which the Arnaz baby was to be born could be predicted , could n't it ? Then why not let TV art copy Hollywood life by having both infants-the real Arnaz baby and the fictitious Ricardo baby-born on the same day ? <P> Delicate Matter . Inspired , the press-agents drew up a five-part memo titled " Various Aspects of the Ricardo Baby in the I Love Lucy Publicity and Promotional Campaign . " In the protocol , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the baby released out of any office before Dec. 8 . " Only then were 40 million televiewers to be let in on the secret of Lucy 's pregnancy . Plans were laid to tie in the show with the Columbia record of There 's a Brand New Baby at Our House and I Love Lucy , both sung by Desi and played by his orchestra . All the pressagents promised to bombard newspapers , magazines and wire services with feature stories . CBS was given a special assignment : " The matter of filming the pregnancy story was so delicate that three clergymen were present to see that everything was in good taste and would offend no one : Rabbi Wolf for the Jewish faith , Monsignor Devlin for the Catholic Church , and the Rev. Clifton Moore for the Protestant faith . . . CBS will handle the story . " <P> Secret Gimmick . Almost everything in radio &; TV needs a gimmick , and the memo had one . It was called " The Secret Gimmick about the Baby 's Sex . " This , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date this week : " The Ricardo baby will be a boy regardless of the sex of the actual Arnaz baby . Of course , if the Arnaz baby does happen to be a boy , then all writers and editors can assume that the producers of I Love Lucy are clairvoyant and possessed of sheer genius . If it happens to be a girl , the story ( and the truth ) is that Desi was so set on having a boy . . . that he went ahead and filmed the Ricardo baby as if it were , regardless . " <P> Finally , the pressagents edged up to the portentous problem of what to do about notifying the gossip columnists : " Walter Winchell should be alerted to be given the first news of the Arnaz baby . We will phone the news to him , since he will be expecting the phone call . When he is alerted , he is to be told nothing of the gimmick but , when he receives the phone call , and not before , he will be given the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the news of the Arnaz baby will be given out simultaneously to Louella , Hedda , Johnson , Graham , all the wire services and all the local dailies . But the story of the gimmick as released to the other outlets will be a follow-up . . . to give Walter an edge . "
