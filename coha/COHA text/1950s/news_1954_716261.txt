txt Mayor Wagner has received ' recommendations from one of his own advisory groups favoring revenue sources that he or his top fiscal aides already have rejected . The group making the recommendations is the subcommittee on business and finance of the Mayor 's Advisory Council . Robert W. Dowling , president of the City Investing Company , is chairman of the subcommittee , and Nathan Straus is chairman of the Advisory Council . The Mayor , accompanied by City Administrator Luther . H. Gulick , Budget Director Abraham D. Beame and Mr. Wagner 's executive secretary , William R. Peer , went to Mr. Straus ' offices at 1657 Broadway yesterday to attend a meeting of the subcommittee . As the Mayor and his aides entered the conference room they learned that simultaneously copies of a. subcommittee letter to the Mayor dated April 24 advocating the proposed revenue sources had been distributed to newspaper men in an anteroom , The conference was behind closed doors . Wider Sales Tax Opposed Tile letter disclosed that the subcommittee , of which David Rockefeller is vice chairman , had advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3 per cent sales tax on commercial services was " so fraught with danger to the city as * * * to require it to be avoided . " The sales tax extension is estimated to yield $30 , - 000,000 to help balance the next budget . The subcommittee letter set forth the following proposals , totaling $28,500,000 , as primary recommendations : iMeave in force the $8,500,000 auto use tax , now scheduled to disappear Jan. 1 , 1955 . Mayor Wagner has promised repeal of this impost , and a bill carrying out the promise is awaiting action by the City Council . cDivert $3,000,000 in parking meter revenues now earmarked for construction of additional offstreet parking facilities to the general fund . clIncrease water rates to bring in an additional $9,000,000 , the approximate yearly loss now sustained by the city at present rates . No suggestion was offered as to just what form this proposed water rate increase should take . CRe-estimate the city 's general fund $8,000,000 higher than at present . Alternative Revenues Proposed Possible alternative revenue sources , which the committee noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " included an overnight parking charge , estimated to yield $25,000,000 . Other possible sources , without any estimates of yield , were proposed tolls on the twelve East River and Harlem River bridges ; extending metered parking into the evening hours , and greater operating economies . Also included in the original text of the letter was another source , which , Mr. Dowling said after yesterday 's meeting , was eliminated from the recommendations . This was a proposal . to take $5,000,000 from the real property fund . Both the proposal to add $8,000,000 to the estimate of the general fund and the suggestion to use the real property , fund were included by State Controller J. Raymond in a set of proposals for alternate revenue sources . The state proposals have been emphatically rejected as unsound by Mayor Wagner , Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa and the Budget Director . It was no secret that the city officials attending yesterday 's meeting were shocked by the unexpected release of the subcommittee 's letter of April 24 . After the meeting Mayor Wagner said guardedly he would await @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's recommendations for settling the city 's financial difficulties . But a moment later he added : " I did n't know this letter was to be released . " Mr. Straus noted that his subcommittee was " purely advisory " an , ' that the proposals made in the letter to the Mayor were only " tentative " suggestions . Mr. Dowling explained that the recommendation concerning the realoltroperty fund had been deleted because the field was considered " non-operational " and there was a question whether the money involved could be applied to the city operating budget . Mr. Straus took full responsibility for giving out the April 24 letter , copies of which had been made available to newsmen by an aide . The reporters were told by Mayor Wagner that he had received the subcommittee 's letter about April 25 and " naturally I gave it a good deal of study . " He said he had shown the letter to the Board of Estimate and- the board still was studying it . Yesterday 's meeting with the Dowling group , he said , was mainly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the recommended items , " the Mayor said , " we need a little more information . As soon as it becomes available , I 'll discuss this further . " The Mayor repeated his contention that any new tax could be avoided if Governor Dewey would call a special legislative session to consider " painless " revenue proposals . Mr. Dowling said his subconl- , mittee had given its support tol , the Mayor 's plan to have a ten-I man committee ? five appointed by the Mayor and five by the Governor ? make a long-range study of the city 's financial needs . Democratic Legislators Reply The Democratic leaders of the state Legislature issued yesterday a statement asserting that " the only person playing politics with the city 's finances is the , Governor . " The statement was in reply to one issued Sunday in behalf of the twenty-five Republican members of the city 's delegation to the Legislature by Daniel J. Riesner , assistant clerk of the Assembly . Mr. Riesner called the Mayor 's apparent intention to press for adoption of the extension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictated by the city 's most powerful Democratic leaders . Yesterday 's Democratic reply was issued by state Senator , Francis of the Nineteenth istrict , Manhattan , and Assemblyman Eugene F. Bannigin of the Eleventh district , ) Brooklyn . " The only person playing politics with the city 's finances is , the Governor of the state who has created crisis after crisis in city affairs by his policy of cat and mouse financing for the city ' every election year . He cares nothing for the city 's welfare . His attitude on every bill is ' What is there in this politically for me ? ' " Mayor Wagner 's office announced that he had scheduled a meeting at City Hall at noon tomorrow to consider tax alter natives with representatives of the Joint Conference on Better Government . The conference , a coalition of sixty-seven civic and business groups , protested the proposed extension of the sales tax last week . Last night a spokesman for the joint conference announced that its representatives would submit a specific program of tax alternatives .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
