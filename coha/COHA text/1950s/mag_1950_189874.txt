As a near-record crop of 37 million pigs began moving to market this spring , the seasonal glut sent the average price of pork dropping to $16 a hundredweight . Secretary of Agriculture Charles F. Brannan warned Congress that unless it gave the Commodity Credit Corp . an extra $2 billion for the overall price-propping program , he could not support the pork market . When Congress did nothing , Brannan 's economists gloomily predicted that unsupported pork might fall as low as $10 a hundredweight . <P> Instead , the market turned as contrary as a razorback hog . Without any Government supports whatever , and in spite of the huge supply , pork prices started to climb , and kept right on climbing . By last week Chicago hogs were at $20.25 , a fat $4.05 above the old support level . <P> Confronted by such theory-defying behavior on the part of a free market , Brannan 's experts dug out plenty of explanations : with its $220 billion national income , the U.S. was eating a lot higher off the hog . ( This year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to 70 Ibs. last year , a lean 48 Ibs. in 1935 . ) Moreover , even at present prices , pork was still a bargain compared to beef and lamb , and many housewives were buying more of it instead . But the lesson that seemed to have been lost on Charlie Brannan was that a growing U.S. economy perhaps did not require quite as much forced feeding as the Fair Deal economists thought .
