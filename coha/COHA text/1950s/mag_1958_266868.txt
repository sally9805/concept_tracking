Gold-mining shares were eagerly bought on the world 's stock exchanges last week . In London , trading was the heaviest in 3 years , and prices climbed to the highest in nine months . Canada had a flurry in low-priced gold shares . In Wall Street , where gold shares have steadily climbed in the past year , Investment Bankers Dillon , Read let out that they are forming an investment trust ( $30 million to start ) to buy South African gold shares , thus adding another fillip to the London buying . <P> Part of the investors ' interest could be attributed to gold 's traditional role as a hedge against recession . While many other industries struggle to sell their product , the U.S. Government buys all domestic gold output ; thus as mining costs decline ( at least theoretically ) and the selling price remains the same , gold-mine profits should rise . <P> But a much bigger reason for the new interest was continued gossip that the U.S. will soon raise the price of gold from $35 an ounce , where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , went the talk , would not only ease the profit squeeze on many of the world 's mining companies , but would also stimulate foreign trade by increasing the foreign-exchange reserves of many U.S. friends and allies . <P> Actually , the U.S. Government has no thought of boosting the price . Reason : it would probably do more harm than good abroad . Canada , South Africa and Russia , which has a huge stockpile , would be helped . But for dozens of other nations , which owe the U.S. money , it would only mean further depletion of their already skimpy foreign reserves .
