txt ALBANY , Jan. ** of the Port of New York Authority were denounced vigorously here today as New York City legislators moved for sweeping investigations into the powers of the bistate body . The Authority operates Hudson River crossings , including the George Washington  --  Bridge and the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels , as well as airports and several other enterprises in New York City and northern New Jersey . The attacks on the agency , made by both Republicans and Democrats , centered on the general allegation that it enjoyed virtual autonomy . The legislators also took the Authority to task for its schedule of tolls , the size of salaries paid to administrative officers , and the fact that it was not subject to court determinations . Three Inquiry Proposals Made Three separate proposals were made for joint legislative committees to inquire into the Authority 's operations , two of them by Democrats and the third by a Republican . Assemblyman Nathan Lashin , Democrat , of the Bronx , called for an investigating committee of six members to " revise the framework of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator John M. Braisted Jr . and Assemblyman Edward V. Curry , Democrats , of Richmond , called for a. similar investigation in companion resolutions , and attacked the Port Authority as " a sovereign super-state . " The Republican proposal , calling for a seven-man committee , was made by Assemblyman Samuel Roman of Manhattan , who assailed the contract-awarding policies of the Authority . Efforts are under way to get similar resolutions introduced in the New Jersey Legislature , which convened at Trenton today . The proposal of the Richmond legislators calls for an inquiry into the toll charges , but would not be limited to that subject . There has been agitation for several years from automobile associations for a reduction or elimination of toll charges for the Holland Tunnel , which is said to have paid for itself already . Assemblyman Lashin said he was not concerned so much with the toll situation as he was with the policies and practices which he said had diverted the Authority from its original purpose of providing Hudson River crossings " into a self-perpetuating organization . " Contract Dispute Recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Port Authority was the charge made last Thursday by the Merritt-Chapman &; Scott Corporation that the authority had submitted incomplete information to Gov . Thomas E. Dewey and Gov . Alfred E. Driscoll of New Jersey to avoid their vetoes of a contract awarded for the Union Bus Terminal in New York City . The Merritt-Chapman &; Scott Corporation submitted the low bid of $8,938,617 for the bus terminal on Eighth Avenue between Forty and Forty-first Streets , but the contract was awarded to the second lowest bidder , the Turner Construction Company , whose bid was $9,194,759 . The Port Authority explained its award by saying it believed the greater experience of the Turner company in city building construction gave greater assurance that the terminal would be completed by next Nov. 1 , Assemblyman Roman asserted that the Authority had exceeded its powers in the matter of the award , and added : " Complaints have been mounting from many quarters for many years over the Port Authority 's conduct of its affairs , on the fixing of toll charges , the cost of its administration , the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en // INQUIRY DEMANDED ON PORT AUTHORITY // minals not 2ontemplated when it was set up in 1921 by an interstate compact .

" Assemblyman Lashin , calling the Authority " a creature removed from all local or state supervision , " submitted four complaints against the bi-state body in addition to its contract policy . These were that the Authority , which is not suable in the courts , had abrogated airline leases when it took over the International Airport at Idlewild , Queens ; that the Authority , asserting it was not subject to " visitation " by any municipal authority , had constructed buildings in New York City without filing plans or obtaining certificates of occupancy ; that it had summarily dispossessed tenants without court orders ; and that it had used income from profitable enterprises such as the Holland Tunnel . and George Washington Bridge to finance projects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries of some of the executive officials were out of line with those paid to other public officers .

Mr. Lashin said that the authority hae used its immunity from suit as " a sword rather than a shield " despite the fact that it had branched out into the operation of airports , and bus and freight terBraisted for Lower Tolls Senator Braisted declared he was confident that an investigation would show that an immediate reduction in tolls was feasible . Such a reduction , he predicted , would not reduce the total revenues of the ? authority since it would result in a larger volume of traffic . Pointing out that the authority 's toll policies were subject to no supervision by any other Government agency , the Richmond Senator added : " The Port Authority is a sovereign super state .

" The Port Authority is composed of twelve non-salaried commissioners , six appointed by the Governor of New York and , six by the Governor of New Jersey . The appointments are for six-year terms . To Aid Inquiry , Says Cullman Howard S. Cullman , chairman of the Port of New York Authority , reached in New York for comment on the Albany charges last night , said : " I have no comment .
