Before the White House announced its antirecession program last week ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , the Federal Reserve Board aimed another and more familiar counterpunch at the recession . For the third time in four months , FRB cut the discount rate . Reserve banks in New York , Chicago , Philadelphia and Atlanta reduced the rate from 2% to 2% . Most of the other eight central reserve banks will soon follow ; the cuts are expected to lead to lower interest rates to boost loans and business expansion . <P> There was little doubt that businessmen were holding back . For the first time in almost three years , the total of loans outstanding in New York City banks fell below the year-ago level . One reason for businessmen 's caution was that a fresh batch of Government statistics showed somewhat more gloom than cheer . Manufacturers ' sales for January dropped by $400 million , new orders slumped by $900 million , and order backlogs dipped by $1.6 billion - the 13th straight monthly decline . Manufacturers ' production went down even faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January v. $300 million the month before . <P> On the bright side , department-store sales , hit hard by mid-February snowstorms , bounced back in the week ending March 1 to rise 1% above the same week last year . And in the last eight days of February new-car sales jumped 27% above the rate at mid-month . <P> Consumers had plenty of money , but they were saving rather than spending it . Savings were up 10% over last year .
