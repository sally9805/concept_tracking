Exaggerated prophecies of gloom had surrounded Dean Acheson 's departure for the London and Lisbon parleys . Last week , reporting on his trip over a radio-TV hookup , Acheson countered with an exaggerated picture of sunlight and good cheer . Said he : " The past two weeks have been a time of historic decision . . . They have brought us to the dawn of a new day in Europe . " Acheson based his claim on " five major accomplishments " of the London and Lisbon meetings . <P> The accomplishments are real , but not Sanforized ; when scrutinized , they shrink . <P> What Is a Division ? " First , " said Acheson , " agreement was reached on the forces to be made available to General Eisenhower 's NATO command . . . " He was referring to the Lisbon decision that " approximately 50 divisions " for Western defense would be in existence by the end of 1952 . This figure is strictly a statistic . Of the 50 divisions , only about 25 will be combat-ready and in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are not to be mobilized until war begins , and then many of them are expected to come from Britain and the U.S. <P> What is a division ? To Eisenhower , it is a unit as strong as the U.S. divisions that he debarked on Dday , 1944 . To the Lisbon planners , a division is only 75% of that strength . According to Eisenhower 's figures , Lisbon actually agreed to only 40 divisions , not 50 . <P> Since Eisenhower now has 20 combat-ready and ten reserve divisions , the Lisbon agreement did provide for progress . But there will not be military security in Europe in 1952 . <P> To pay for the " 50 " divisions , the Lisbon meeting accepted the " Wise Men 's " recommendation for a total NATO defense expenditure of $300 billion in the next three years . For the first time , the NATO nations adopted a unified economic program for sharing defense costs and spending the money in a coordinated way . <P> Commendable as the Wise Men 's efforts were , it was notable that NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get itself a single , sensible economic blueprint . Acheson frankly recognized that it was only a blueprint , that the $300 billion has still to be appropriated by 14 national Parliaments , including the U.S. Congress . <P> The day before Acheson spoke , Premier Edgar Faure 's French government fell on the very issue of raising the tax revenue required by the Wise Men ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . Here was a solid warning of how fragile the whole Lisbon web might be . Embarrassed , Acheson merely noted that the French cabinet crisis " illustrates the problems which will arise . " <P> Arming Germany . " Second , " said Acheson , " agreement was reached on the bases and facilities ... for these forces . " A more specific interpretation : after more than a year of financial chaos and construction delays , the Lisbon conferees agreed on how to share the $400 million bill for building the air bases and supply lines that Eisenhower requires .                  @ @ @
