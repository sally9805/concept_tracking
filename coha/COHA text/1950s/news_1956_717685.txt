txt At 5 or 6 o'clock on the evening of Wednesday , Jan. 25 ? Senator Francis Case ( R ) of South Dakota says he is n't sure which  --  Ernest J. Kahler , business manager of the Sioux Falls Daily Argus-Leader called up the senator 's office in Washington and said , " Something has been left for your campaign , Francis . What shall I do with it ? " " Take it over to John Griffin , To is receiving campaign funds , " answered the senator . " What is it ? " " It 's an envelope , and it has 25 $100 bills in it . " There was a pause and a gasp on the long-distance line . That was the beginning of an incident that flared up into a sensation at this week 's vote on the Fulbright-Harris bill to end federal regulation of natural gas producers , passed by the Senate , 53 to 38 , amid cries of extraordinary pressure by wealthy lobbies . Campaign Picnired Senator Case , testifying before a select committee on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican in Republican South Dakota which showed why a sudden , inexplicable contribution of $2,500 was like the explosion of ' an atomic bomb . The senator , a talkative , busy little man with a profile remarkably like that of Harry S. Truman . gave a folksy feeling to the affair as he went back as far as 1910 and high-school days , and ranged among friends , from one who " lives in Custer , by the Wyoming line , " to those in Sioux Falls " in Minnehaha County . " There were three conditions imposed on all his campaign contributions , Senator Case said ? that there would be " no liquor money , nothing in excess of $100 , and no strings attached . Senator Case explained that he had expected to make his whole senatorial reelection campaign on a budget of " 310,000 or $15,000 " ( depending on whether he was opposed in the primary ) , of which the Republican National Committee would contribute about $4,000 . The worst thing , said Senator Case , was that he could n't place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the 25 $100 bills with a mutual friend . Hard to Trace Nobody in the Case office seemed to remember anybody named " Neff , " but on going through old correspondence , Mr. Case found his name mentioned . That deepened the mystery be cause he came from out of state , over in Nebraska . It appeared that a John M. Neff of Lexington , Neb. , had called on mutual friend in Sioux Falls and inquired how the senator stood on the gas bill ; that he had also come later to Washington and tried , but failed , to see ' Senator Case at his office , where he had repeated his interest in the gas bill : that he had been informed by Mr. Case 's political friends at Sioux Falls that they thought Mr. Case would vote for the Fulbright-Harris bill . Then he had made his contribution to the Case campaign fund ? no strings attached , mild-mannered Mr. Case was at pains to emphasize  --  but it apparently was so timed that it would arrive just in the final days of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Case explained . He said that he had called Nebraska Senator Roman L. Hruska , a fellow Republican , and that the latter had identified Mr. Neff as an attorney . Then Mr. Case ordered that the money be re turned and decided to vote against the bill on the suspicion that big financial stakes must be involved for interested parties . It now is known that Mr. Neff was registered in the 1955 Nebraska State Legislature as a lobbyist for the Superior Oil Company of Austin , Texas . Mr. Neff has aggressively denied any wrongdoing in his contribution to Mr. Case and he will go on the stand shortly to give his own explanation of the affair . Now President Eisenhower has the bill . It is widely believed he will sign it . Yet he is giving Senators Johnson and Knowland a bad time by press-conference remarks this week that certain things need clearing up , Nobody really thinks it will happen  --  but if Mr. Eisenhower should really veto the measure with a strong attack charging the Democrats with a " giveaway " program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election arguments into a cocked hat . It would create a sensation second only to an announcement that he would run again .
