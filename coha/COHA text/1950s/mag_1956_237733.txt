The Three Circles of Nasser 's Ambition <P> Nasser 's The Philosophy of the Revolution , published two years ago , has now become must reading in Western chancelleries . France 's Premier Mollet calls it Nasser 's Mein Kampf . In a time of tension , the comparison is pat , but overreaching . Yet , like Mein Kampf , Nasser 's little book is a self-revealing portrait of a restless , unstable man intoxicated with vast ambitions . Excerpts : <P> FATE does not jest and events are not a matter of chance-there is no existence out of nothing . We can not look at the map of the world without seeing our own place on it ... <P> For some reason it seems to me that within the Arab circle there is a role wandering aimlessly in search of a hero . For some reason it seems to me that this role is beckoning to us-to move , to take up its lines , put on its costume and give it life . Indeed , we are the only ones who can play it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region surrounding us to create a great power , which will then rise up to a level of dignity and undertake a positive part in building the future of mankind . <P> The First Circle <P> There can be no doubt that the Arab circle is the most important and the one with which we are most closely linked . For it is intertwined with us by history . We have suffered together , we have gone through the same crises , and when we fell beneath the steeds of the invaders they were with us under the same hooves . We are also bound within this circle by virtue of religion . <P> I maintain we are strong . The only trouble is , we do not realize just how strong we are . When I try to analyze the elements of our strength , there are three main sources . The first is that we are a community of neighboring peoples . . . <P> The second source of strength is our land itself and its position on the map of the world-that important strategic position which embraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traders and passageway of its armies . <P> There remains the third source : oil , a sinew of material civilization without which all its machines would cease to function . The great factories producing every kind of goods-all the instruments of land , sea , and air communication ; all the weapons of war , from the mechanical bird above the clouds to the submarines beneath the waves-all would cease to function , and rust would overcome every iron part beyond hope of motion or life . . . <P> The center of world oil production has shifted from the U.S. , where wells are going dry . the cost of land is going up and the wages of workers have risen , to the Arab area where the wells are still virgin , where land over vast spaces continues to cost nothing , and where the worker continues to receive less than a subsistence wage . Half the proved reserves of oil in the world lie beneath Arab soil . Have I made clear how great the importance of this element of strength is ? So we are strong-strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shout for help , but rather when we remain silent and . . . really understand the strength resulting from the ties binding us together . <P> The Interior of the Dark Continent
