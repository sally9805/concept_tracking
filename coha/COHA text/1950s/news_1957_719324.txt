txt Premier Felix Gaillard has won his first confidence vote , on the always sticky issue of new taxes , by the unexpectedly large margin of 256 to 182 ? almost four times larger than it was expected to be . The young French Premier frankly took advantage of the stir over the , Anglo-American arms delivery to Tunisia to make an appeal for national solidarity at this time and this accounts for the size of the " yes " votes . The combination of national pride being offended over Timisia and the possibility of being without a government during the December meeting with President Eisenhower produced a vote , Nov. 19 , which did not indicate the true feeling about either the taxes or the Gaillard government . Police Are Barometer In official circles and some of the French press , feathers were still ruffled over Anglo-American arms shipments to Tunisia . But judging from talks with a large number of people , the proverbial " man in the street " has a different opinion . Only a few were upset  --  and that slightly ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing .. Just more politics . " An even clearer prcpf was that best barometer of feeling in France , police movements . The Paris police keep close watch on the public pulse . They spew dozens of policemen into any area the minute anything may happen . It is by the dress and attitude of the police that one can take the best measure of French tension in these cases . . Thus , the night of Nov. 18 the Hotel Scribe was surrounded by 15 great police vans , each carrying two dozen men , plus French Army cars . It all looked pretty . serious . But then thiS writer noted that the police wore their ordinary hats or kepis , which showed it was not serious or they would have been wearing steel helmets or at least had them fastened to their belts . Pineal ' Speaks Out The men looked completely relaxed ; there was none of that undercurrent of tension one feels if real trouble is brewing . I asked a high police official , busy directing the trucks , what it was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , monsieur , " he said . Another police official grinned and said the one word , with knowing look , which explains everything in France , " Politics ! " Against these facts , the Washington report of the Paris newspaper Figaro , clearly based on its correspondent 's talks with French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau following the Tatter 's first interview with Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , is revealing . Wounded pride colored the entire report . For example , at the beginning : " It is not the guarantees demanded by our country which conditions American policy , but rather finding agreement with President Bourguiba of Tunisia . " Next came a much more sinister type of threat . " To enlighten - Mr . Dulles still further , " Figaro wrote , " the French Foreign Minister was able to state the multiple de-marches of Soviet diplomacy since the outbreak of the crisis among the three Western powers . These were such that if one does not take care , a majority of French opinion could accept ? if not wish  --  a reversal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Atlantic and Western orbit into the Soviet orbit . Inevitably this would make France a Soviet satellite . isolation ' Discounted Apparently carried away by his own presentation , M , Pineau continued , according to Figaro , " It is exactly this that the American Government must understand , It is exactly this which it affects not to understand . For the danger is not one of French ' isolationism . ' The danger is not that France will find itself isolated if the United States , by a sudden Hex , decides to ' cut off its living . ' France can not be isolated . Its position is much too strong . " In concluding , Figaro emphasized , however , that " the Gaillard government itself does not threaten to go to these extremes . " It only demands that Anglo-American arms supplies to Tunisia should " correspond " to Tunisia 's " authentic needs and that the legitimate demands of France be respected . " Yet at the same time that excitement over Tunisia appeared to recede , new trouble arose on the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation was threatened with a repetition of a strike of gas and electricity workers .
