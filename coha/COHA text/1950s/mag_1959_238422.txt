FOR 2 PLAIN ( 313 pp. ) - Harry Golden-World ( $4 ) . <P> <P> It is an absurd thing to be pelted with matzoth balls , and for some years now , the South 's more sensitive segregationists have been feeling absurd . The barrage of wet kosher dumplings comes from an overweight ( 198 Ibs. ) leprecohen named Harry Golden , who lives in Charlotte , N.C. and publishes an eccentric ( no news , all editorials ) newspaper called The Carolina Israelite ( TIME , April 1 , 1957 ) . When he is not waging his blintzkrieg against the racists , Golden may be tweaking some fellow Jews by the short hair of their mink stoles , sentimentalizing about his boyhood in Manhattan 's Lower East Side , or solemnly addressing the young ladies of a Presbyterian college on " Contributions of Calvinism to American Democracy . " The combination is engaging and makes sense ; Only in America , Golden 's book of clippings from the Israelite , sold 270,000 hard-cover copies , is still going strong , and is being fashioned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> For 2 Plain is more of the same , although here and there the pickle-barrel philosopher scrapes bottom . The new book offers nothing as trenchant as Only in America 's " Vertical Negro Plan , " which solves the problem of painless school integration by removing seats from classroom desks-on the theory that white Southerners think nothing of associating with Negroes when they are standing in elevators , supermarket queues , and the like . In the second collection , there is more blandness than bite , although Golden does return to the subject of segregation : " Free of charge , I offered the $64,000 people an idea to help get an additional ten million viewers in the South : Ask the questions they ask Negroes in Mississippi to qualify them as voters . They 're interesting questions , like , How many bubbles in a pound of soap . " <P> Wasted Whiskers . There is again much of the old nostalgia . Back on Manhattan 's Lower East Side , Golden recalls , the old folks would mutter , " A klug zu Columbus'n " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not hot enough in the Turkish baths . Rough translation : " Columbus should have broken his head before he discovered America . " But there were consolations . " For 2 plain " a lad could buy a large glass of clear Seltzer . Flavoring cost a penny more , but sometimes he could persuade the counterman to " put a little on the top " for nothing . Jewish boys seldom learned to swim , says Golden , because the waterfront lay deep in Irish territory . The immigrants had an enormous respect for learning , and in every photography studio , the appropriate props were on hand . " When the fellow posed you he said , ' How about a pair of eyeglasses ? ' You acted a bit coy , but you were very grateful to the man , especially when he also put a pencil in your hand . " <P> Golden 's friend Carl Sandburg , about whom he is writing a book , has called him the Jewish Will Rogers . He might be called the Jewish Edgar Guest , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Rogers twang . Golden on the U.S. Astronauts : " Having found the perfect man , it seems the last place they should send him is to the moon . They ought to shoot off the least qualified man , because we need the best man like we never needed him before . "
