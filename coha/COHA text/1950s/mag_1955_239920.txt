Chirped the London Daily Mirror one morning last week : HERE WE ARE AGAIN . Shouted the big , black headlines in the Daily Sketch : AT LAST IT 'S OVER . READ ALL ABOUT IT . After 26 days , London 's newspaper strike was settled . Queueing up at the stands , news-hungry Londoners snapped up papers so fast that the extra-heavy press runs could not keep up with the demand . Since the strike caused some 50 million readers to miss three of the most exciting events in recent British history , i.e. , the change of Prime Ministers , the announcement of a general election , a cut in income taxes , the Times and Daily Telegraph put out brief supplements to tell Londoners what they had missed . <P> Muscle-Flexing . The strike cost Fleet Street upwards of $8,000,000 , and the Star , Evening News and Evening Standard were forced to raise prices a halfpenny to recoup some of their lost revenue . It also taught British publishers a hard lesson in Communist tactics . The strike was called against all members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trades Union and the Amalgamated Engineering Union , whose London locals are also under Communist influence . <P> All told , only 700 electricians and engineers walked out , over demands for an $8.19 pay raise to bring their average pay to around $40 a week . The papers could have printed , but in Britain , when one union walks out , other union men would not think of breaking the strike . Thus some 23,000 printers , pressmen , etc. had no papers to put out . <P> But E.T.U.-A.E.U. did not strike London 's Communist Daily Worker , which does not belong to the Proprietors ' Association . The paper said that it would meet the E.T.U.-A.E.U. demand . However , the Worker 's compositors walked out on the grounds that if the Worker could afford to boost wages of maintenance men , it could take back compositors laid off in a recent economy drive . Twelve days after the strike 's beginning , the Worker settled with all its employees , and for two weeks it was London 's only daily ( TIME , April 18 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the E.T.U.-A.E.U. to try to end the strike , they found that the union bargainers were almost all Communist Party members . While wages were an issue , there was no doubt that the Communists were taking the opportunity to flex their muscles , show the public that they could hit where it would hurt most . <P> " Unjustified . " After the unions refused to budge from their position , a government-appointed three-man court of inquiry was called in . It found the demands " unjustified . . . unrealistic , " since they would boost the unions ' scale well above that of the rest of the country . But the negotiators refused to bargain . Labor Minister Sir Walter Monckton proposed that the strikers go back to work on all papers , pending a settlement , but his appeal fell on deaf ears .
