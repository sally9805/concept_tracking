As a bitter critic of Nevada 's Senator Pat McCarran , Las Vegas Sun Publisher Hank Greenspun has more than political disagreements with his state 's senior Senator . In a suit filed last spring , Greenspun charged that McCarran had conspired with more than 20 Nevada gambling casino owners to withdraw about $8,000 a month in casino ads from the Sun , thus attempting to silence the paper 's criticism of him ( TIME , June 16 ) . Last week the $225,000 damage suit charging that McCarran had conspired with the gamblers was settled out of court . Under the terms of the settlement the amount paid to Greenspun was estimated at $80,000 Said Greenspun : " I can view this settlement as nothing else but a complete vindication of my stand .
