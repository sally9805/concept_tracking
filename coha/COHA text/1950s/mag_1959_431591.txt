It is not that tarpon are particularly-hard to find or that , once found , they must be teased and tempted with delicate cunning into taking the lure . Around this time of year they igrate northward in vast schools over a wide range , rolling through the pale-blue flats of Florida Bay , up ter east coast past Miami Beach , up the west coast past the Ten Thousand Islands and Boca Grande and Pass-a-Grille , along the Gulf Coast past the Mississippi delta , Southwest Pass and Grand Isle to Galveston and Port Aransas . During this period from mid-March to midsummer , tarpon are available to those who fish from skiffs as well as cruisers , from piers and docks and beaches , in daytime or at night . They are pursued by trollers and casters and still fishermen , with plugs and bait and spoons and feathers and flies , on heavy boat rigs and light casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found in deep water just off shore , in the surf , along the flats or in the bays . The smaller tarpon ? and there are thousands of them throughout the estuaries and rivers and canals of Florida and parts of Texas ? can even be found in fresh water . The secret of the tarpon 's fascination is that he is so very hard to catch . There are only a few spots in the tough , leathery mouth where a hook can penetrate ? a narrow strip of skin along the lip and a thinner membrane in the corner of the jaw ? and even here there is no guarantee the barb will remain fixed . Those famed aerial gymnastics ? a tarpon can jump as high as 12 or 15 feet and sometimes cover a distance of more than 25 feet in one great arching plunge ? are a most effective way of dislodging the hook . When he comes out of the water , head shaking and gill covers rattling , the tarpon frequently sends the lure , whatever it may be , whistling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of veteran tarpon fishermen bear scars . Fishing from a boat and using 30-pound test line , a good fisherman can expect to land perhaps one out of four or five tarpon which he hooks . But the moment he moves down to lighter line ? or the moment he leaves the boat and tries to catch a tarpon from a bridge or pier , regardless of what strength tackle he has in hand ? the odds in the tarpon 's favor soar to something usually far better than 25 to 1 . The world record for rod and reel , hauled out of Venezuela 's Lake Maracaibo three years ago by a man named Mario Salazar , is 283 pounds . A tarpon measuring 8 feet 2 inches in length and weighing an estimated 350 pounds was caught in a net at the Hillsboro River Inlet , north of Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , on August 6 , 1912 . But these giant specimens and others like them , which occasionally continued SPORTS ILLUSTRATED . V ? Y : I. . ? 81  | turn up throughout the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anglers know so well . A tarpon in the 60- or 80- or 100-pound class , measuring five or six feet in length , can be as rowdy and boisterous an adversary as any fisherman could want . The tarpon probably gets much of his desperate energy from simple primitiveness . One of a group of herringlike fishes , he is of even more ancient vintage than his relatives , the salmon , bonefish and trout . According to Dr. Charles M. Breder , the curator of fishes for the American Museum of Natural History , Megalops atlantictts has been swimming around in virtually the same form ever since the Cretaceous period , some 100 million years ago . Among the many explanations for the tarpon 's successful struggle to escape extinction , one stands out : he was well designed to begin with . like other fishes , the tarpon h large lunglike air bladder , and it keep this filled with oxygen that comes to the surface at frequent intervals , his metallic blue-green ! flashing in that rolling motion . familiar to fishermen . He takes air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because he is totally dependent on receiving oxygen supply from the water . tarpon is able to live for great per of time in brackish , muddy , s ! times contaminated pools and pools where other species can not survive .

Buck Starke , one of the famous guides of the Keys , once found a handful of two- and threeinch tarpon in a land-locked pool among the mangroves , and put them in his hat to show the folks back home .

His son transferred them to a fresh-water tank a few hours later , and the next spring they were released back into the bay . By then they were almost a foot long . The large adult female tarpon will carry more than 10 million eggs into the spawning season each spring , odds which insure that a large number will survive the early depredations of certain varieties of voracious plankton which feed upon tarpon eggs . Baby tarpon , like any small fish in the sea , are vulnerable too , but once the tarpon reaches maturity he has everything in his favor . He is big and strong and well armored , and his speed and terrific acceleration keep him out of danger . And , apparently , he is distasteful even to the shark , his lone enemy and old traveling companion through the ages .

Strays are occasionally found as far south as Argentina and as far north as the mouth of New York Bay , where a few are taken each year in pound nets . Twice , years ago , tarpon were reported in Nova Scotia , and across the Atlantic they are quite common off the northwest Africa coast . But for some reason , tarpon are not found in the Pacific . There is a close relative , the oxeye herring , or Megalops cyprinoides , common to the Indo-Malaya region , from the north coast of New South Wales around Australia and up among the islands to the north . But this is a smaller fish , seldom reaching @# M continued our feet in length , and it has a mu larger eye .

Bu for the man who wants excitement and thrills and sport at its best , ther is no place to compare with that vas area of sparkling water and mangrovedotted islets between the Keys an Everglades known as " the back coun try " of Florida Bay . Here are th perfect conditions for tarpon fishing : crystal-clear water over the flats and hordes of big , hungry fish . Castin for giant tarpon from a small ski with ultralight tackle in clear , shallow water is one of the most delightful fishing experiences known to man . Here are combined the anticipation of the hunt , the thrill of the stalk , the skill of expert casting and a type o fight unequaled anywhere else . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great distance , there is first of all the dramatic impact of viewing the great shadowy form which is the prey . With the outboard motor raised fro mthe water , the skill is poled slowly and carefully toward the fish . Once within casting range , the lure must be presented at just the right moment to the exact spot , usually about six feet ahead of a slow-moving tarpon . An improp- erly placed plug will either startle him : tto immediate flight or else fail to : : tract him at all . And then , of course , there is the fight . The tarpon , wherever he is caught , will jump . But sometimes he will go down to fight , too , if the water is deep enough , and ' eventually in most places he usually tries this . But in the back country of Florida Bay , where the water is measured in feet instead of fathoms , there Is no place for him to go but up .

Coughlan , who has fished for practically every game fish in the world 's oceans , considers the tarpon the greatest fish of all . He has caught them by the hundreds , including 53 weighing more than 100 pounds . He has won the Metropolitan Miami Tournament so often that they are about to give it to him for keeps . Recently , he was persuaded to give his views on tarpon and how to catch them . " It 's mostly hard work and experience , " Coughlan said . " There are still those who say this kind of fishing is trick fishing , that big tarpon were never meant to be caught on such light tackle . But there is one simple test : if you consistently catch a fish , using any kind of tackle , then there is nothign tricky aobut it . Of course , " and Coughlan smiles when he says this , " you ca n't make any mistakes when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I use a torpedo-shaped , surface-type lure when pugging .
