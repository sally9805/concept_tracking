Through eight days and 800 pages of testimony in Federal Court in Manhattan , a handsome , boyish Swedish merchant marine officer unemotionally went back and forth over the dozen minutes of his life that he would never forget nor be allowed to forget . On the night of July 25 , Third Mate Johan-Ernst Carstens-Johannsen , 26 , was in command of the bridge of the 12,500-ton Swedish liner Stockholm when she speared and sank the 29,000-ton Italian liner Andrea Doria . At stake , as he told his story , were not only legal claims totaling some $40 million but the still unanswered questions of blame in the great North Atlantic shipping tragedy ( TIME , Aug. 6 ) . <P> He took the watch on Stockholm 's bridge at 8:30 p.m. , said Carstens-Johannsen . About an hour later Captain H. G. Nordenson went below , leaving him in command to maintain a course of 87 . The speed was 18 or 19 knots , and the night , he testified , was clear , with good visibility and a full view of the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nantucket lightship , he was bothered only by ocean currents that pulled the ship two or three miles northward off course , and by the need to keep a weather eye on the duty helmsman , who was sometimes " more interested in sur rounding things than in the compass . " <P> " Patches of Fog . " Shortly before 11 p.m. he picked up the pip of a ship on the bridge radarscope ( he did not know it was Andrea Doria ) , about twelve miles off his port bow . Andrea Doria was at that point running a few miles south of the westbound lane of Track Charlie , an " informal " sea lane charted by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey , and generally followed by the big transatlantic liners of the U.S. , Britain , France and Holland , but not necessarily by the Italians and the Swedes . Eastbound Stockholm was about 19 miles north of the eastbound lane of Charlie . <P> <P> Carstens-Johannsen tracked the unidentified ship as she closed in thus from ten miles away : <P> <P> He calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a mile of Stockholm . He did not see Andrea Doria 's lights until she was less than two miles away . ( At once the counsel for the Italian Line pounced : " What do you think obscured the lights ? " Replied Carstens-Johannsen : " That 's what I 'm also wondering , " and then he conceded that Andrea Doria might have been obscured by " patches of fog . " ) In any case , mindful of the captain 's order not to pass within a mile of another ship , he ordered a sharp turn to starboard , thus pulling Stockholm about 22 to starboard : <P> <P> As Stockholm was swinging to her new course , Carstens-Johannsen turned to answer a phone call from the crow 's nest reporting the movements of the fast-approaching ship . When he came back out onto the port wing of the bridge , he saw the sight he would never forget . Before him in the dark Atlantic loomed the brightly lighted shape of a passenger liner , showing her starboard green running light , and moving fatally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Full astern ! " The desperate orders rang out again in the sedate courtroom . " I saw there would come a collision , " testified Carstens-Johannsen , still even-voiced , still calm . " It was a collision situation . I had to stop my ship . " At 11:09 p.m. the ships collided , as he saw it , thus :
