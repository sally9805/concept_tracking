txt The people of this city must be bewildered a good share of the time as to whether they are doing a good job or a bad job on water saving . Let us take a look at the record : On Feb. 27 Commissioner Carney said that if consumption did not drop in the next few days ? especially on Dry Thursday ? he would announce on Friday ( March 3 ) specific restrictions that would be enforced . These were expected to be largely industrial . At that time New Yorkers had increased their average daily consumption in the previous week to nearly 900,000,000 gallons , a 25,000,000-gallon daily increase , the largest one-week jump since conservation began . The next day , Feb. 28 , Edward J. Clark , chief engineer for the Bureau of Water Supply , said it was the " last call " for voluntary savings . Dry Thursday , March 2 , was fairly effective ; consumption fell to 858,000 , - 000 gallons . In summing up on Friday Commissioner Carney 's spirits had so risen that he ignored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which he was supposed to announce those " specific restrictions . " Yet he must have been well aware that the average for the week was not going to be good ? as we shall shortly develop . On March 3 , then ' , Mr. Carney was full of compliments to the people of New York for " excellent results " on Dry Day . He was going to wait until this week 's water holiday to see whether those threatened , but still unnamed , industrial restrictions would at last be put in effect . He did deliver a shocker , however , by announcing then and there that the second Thursdays of June , July and August would be water holidays ! Engineer Clark , on Feb. 4 , added further confusion by saying that he was " not particularly concerned " over the losses in reservoir storage in the last few days . He was uneasy , however , over the continuing dry spell ; a very sound observation , we might add , although only a few days earlier it had been pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a total of two inches . On Sunday daily reports showed that , except for the " successful " Dry Thursday , use of water last week was greater than in any week since the conservation program began in October . And yesterday Water Department figures showed a loss for the fourth consecutive day of water in storage . Storage fell in seven of the last nine days . Average daily use of water last week rose 8,000,000 gallons above the previous week , and Mr. Clark was " disappointed , " but he still feels that the " majority of people are making a remarkable contribution to the waterconservation program . " Water Department officials have cried Wolf ! so often on compulsory restrictions , and have apparently based policy so steadily on the insufficient base of what happens on Dry Day instead of a full week 's showing , that we have ceased to expect continuity or consistency . If summer brings suffering for water , city officials will pardon us if we say we told you so ? back in the days when they were delivering threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
