txt State Senator Walter J. Mahoney took the spotlight yesterday in the battle for the Republican nomination for Governor . In a surprise statement he said that if he were nominated at the party 's convention in Rochester next month , he would accept . Senator Mahoney had said repeatedly in recent weeks that he would not give his position on the gubernatorial race until just before the delegates convened on Aug. 25 . His announcement yesterday was widely interpreted as an effort to forestall defection of support that had been pledged to him by county leaders and organizations . It presumably was designed also to assure his supporters that they were not backing a candidate who would not be available to make the race . The statement followed by a day the decision of the Oneida County Committee at Utica to switch its twenty-three delegate votes from Mr. Mahoney to Nelson A. Rockefeller .. Oneida , Herkimer and Madison Counties had been among the early supporters of the Buffalo legislator , but had become impatient at Mr. Mahoney 's silence . Mr. Mahoney issued his statement at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If the delegates think I am the best equipped candidate for the nomination to lead the party to victory in our state in November , I stand ready to accept the honor and responsibility . " It is plainly evident that any Republican candidate to be successful in the November election must campaign on the record made by the Republican Legislature in the last four years . " On this premise there is no need for me to tour the state to meet and talk with party leaders and delegates . I have been fighting the Republican battle in the Legislature , not only in the last four years but for the last twenty-two years . " Mr. Mahoney made no mention of the Oneida defection , but , he said he was acting " at the ' insistent urging of a. number ' of county chairmen who have declared for me and others whop want to declare for me . " " The nominee for Governors will be the man selected by the delegates to the state conven-1 tion , " he said . " I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or party service . " The Senator 's statement was veiwed as placing him definitely in the race , but not as an active candidate canvassing for votes . Four Now in Race It brought to four the number who have entered the race for the nomination . The others are Mr. Rockefeller , Leonard W. Hall , former national Republican chairman , and Paul Williams , who resigned last week as United States Attorney in the Southern District to make the race . Both Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Hall have been actively seeking delegate support and Mr. Williams plans to make an up-state trip for that purpose next week . As the race now stands , Mr. Rockefeller has taken the lead with 313 pledged delegates . Mr. Hall has the pledges of 163 and the probability of 106 more from the Brooklyn delegation . Mr. Williams has no pledges . There will be 1,170 delegate votes at the convention , with 586 needed for nomination . Senator Mahoney has 154 delegates pledged . The remainder of the delegate votes either are promised to Assembly Speaker Oswald D. Heck of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from L. Judson Morhouse , Republican state chair ' man , a comment similar to the one he made when the three other aspirants declared . " Senator Mahoney is another outstanding Republican who would be an attractive candidate and a good Governor , and one of several who could defeat Governor Harriman , " the chairman said . Assemblyman Malcolm Wilson , acting campaign manager for Mr. Rockefeller , who is in Maine for the week-end , said the Mahoney statement was " another sign of the tremendous vitality of the Republican party and a further evidence of the widespread conviction that the Republican party will win in November . " Mr. Hall , returning from a four-day upstate tour , commented that ' Mr. Mahoney 's entry in the race was " a healthy sign . " Michael H. Prendergast , Democratic state chairman , said Mr. Mahoney 's announcement - " confirms what I have said right along  --  that he wants to be the candidate-maker and not the condidate . " " I agree with Senator Mahoney on one thing , " he said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican failures in the Legislature , for many of which Senator Mahoney bears chief responsibility .
