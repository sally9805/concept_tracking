THE CARETAKERS ( 404 pp. ) - Dariel Telfer-Simon &; Schuster ( $4.50 ) . <P> <P> This is an angry first novel about the casual maltreatment of the insane in a Midwestern state asylum called Canterbury . The book 's anger might be a great deal more effective if Author Telfer , who herself spent six years as a clerk in a state institution , did not keep abandoning the snake pit for the passion pit . <P> Low-budget Canterbury is a kind of unrest home where an inmate ekes out his life like an indeterminate prison sentence . Most of the attendants are too overworked and too unfeeling to do more than slap the patients into line . The wards are the circles of a neo-Dantean inferno . In Stationary , the patients are strapped into chairs to groan , curse and soil themselves through the day . In Hydro , a patient is wrapped mummy-fashion in icy wet sheets for 72 hours at a stretch . In the " untidy " wards the bedridden turn their heads obsessively from side to side , rubbing off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly rituals as Bath Day , when the patients are divested of rubber bands , bits of tobacco and the last shreds of dignity , are recorded with repellent candor . <P> But when Author Telfer deserts the patients for their keepers , the fervent social reformer becomes a kind of madhouse Grace Metalious . Two nurse trainees , Kathy Hunter and Althea Home , develop identical crushes on Donovan Macleod , the strong , silent head doctor . Macleod is impervious , but his colleague , Dr. Larry Denning , is so " vigorously amorous " that he rips off Althea 's dress one night and treats her to what he regards as therapeutic rape . Pretty soon both nurses are sleeping in beds they never made . <P> As it gets progressively unzippered emotionally , The Caretakers also goes melodramatically berserk . One patient chokes to death in neglect , one attendant is strangled by an inmate , and a lecherous doctor who impregnates a nymphomaniac patient has his skull crushed by the woman 's husband . Such aphrodisiac antics strongly suggest that Author Telfer 's characters-the sick as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as a document of conditions in many state hospitals for the insane , now undergoing some exciting reforms ( TIME , Nov. 16 ) , the book will shock as well as arouse compassion .
