txt With all but two Southern states voting for it , the National Education Association adopted yesterday a resolution asking that segregation end in the nation 's public schools . Only the delegates from South Carolina and Mississippi voted " no . " When the vote was taken , every state in the ' Union was represented . The educators recognized that this was a " hot " issue . There had been sharp discussion in the preliminary hearings of the ? Committee on Resolutions on the wording of a segregation statement . But the delegates took the issue to the floor of the Representative Assembly . When the discussion ended , the teachers strengthened the original resolution . The South is well represented in the N. E. A. 's highest policymaking circles . The president , Dr. William A. Early , is Superintendent of Schools in Savannah , Ga . The president-elect , . Miss Waurine Walker , is an educator from Austin , Tex . She was chosen at yesterday 's session . Higher Salaries Demanded The delegates also went beyond their own leaders on the.question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedules ranging from $3,600 to $8,200 . Led by the New York State delegation , the delegates voted , with only one negative vote among more than 4,000 eligible to vote , to seek much higher schedules . They asked for a scale starting at $4,000 and going to $9,000 . This is almost double what the average American teacher now gets . Twenty thousand teachers , superintendents , college officials and prominent educators attended the six-day N. E. A. sessions , which closed late last night . The ' ninety-second annual convention , ' first held here since 1938 , had its headquarters at Madison Square Garden and overflowed into vari- ous hotels throughout the city . There were more than 750 speakers at 200 sessions . When the segregation resolution reached the floor , it was seconded by the Maryland delegation , amid applause ; A ' moment later , the Delaware delegation added : " We resolution , as . originally presented , began : " Pursuant to the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States with regard to racial segregation , the National ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools is more than an idea * * * " One of the Pennsylvania delegates , Dr. Robert D. Clark of Philadelphia , objected to the wording . The educational profession of America , he contended , does not depend on the Supreme Court ruling to recognize the necessity for racial equality . " We dare to think the things we know are right to think , and we ? do n't wait to think until the Supreme Court acts , " he declared . It was pointed out later , howlever , that this was the first time lin its ninety-seven-year history that the N. E. A. had taken a stand on the issue of segregation in the public schools . The Segregation Resolution The South Carolina delegation , with Harris Marshall as its spokesman , opposed the resolution as premature . The Supreme Court has not handed down a decree on how or when integra-1 tion should be accomplished , he emphasized . " We beg the N. E. A. to defeat ' the resolution , " he pleaded . The amended resolution , as adopted , read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court of the United States with regard to racial segregation is reflected in the long-established ' provisions of the platform of the National Education Association . The association recognizes ' that integration of all groups in our public schools is more than an idea . It is a process which concerns every state and territory in our nation . " The association urges that all citizens approach this matter of integration in the public schools with the spirit of fair play and goodwill which has klways been an outstanding characteristic of the American people . " It is the conviction of the association that all problems of integration in our schools are capable of solution by citizens of intelligence , saneness and reasonableness working together in the interests of national unity for the common good of all . " In calling . for record teacher salaries , the delegates demanded that teaching get the same recognition as . other . -. professions , and that , educators , be . paid accordingly . Dr. James A. Cullen of Mount Vernon , N. Y. , the New York State N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries . He stressed that the N. E. A. salary goals had a positive influence on the thinking of school officials and school boards . " If our profession has shown a single weakness in the past , " Dr. Cullen said , " it has been the weakness of placing a low value on the services of teachers to this nation . " This weakness has been a major factor in keeping salaries at a level far lower than they rightfully should be , judged by fair standards of justice or by the competitive salaries which are offered other professions . " Other Resolutions Acted ? On The convention adopted a resolution favoring Federal aid to states for higher teachers ' salaries . It also asked for aid for essential school construction . For the first time at a teachers ' convention , the educators coupled cigarettes with narcotics . As originally taken to the floor , a resolution was proposed urging schools to stress the harmful effects of narcotics . One of the Pennsylvania delegates asked that cigarettes be included . One delegate observed that some schools even provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn cob pipes . The resolution as adopted said : " The National Education Association believes that the schools should continue to stress education regarding the harmful effects of narcotics and cigarettes by making full use of the most recent research on the problem . " More emphasis should be placed on the teaching of American history and citizenship training in the nation 's schools , Arthur J. Connell , commander of the American Legion , declared at the morning session . The study of American history , he said , should be the most dramatic and unforgettable part of every child 's school experience . ? " Americans who do not know their beginnings can do justice neither to their country nor themselves , " Mr. Connell declared . " The time for discovering the greatness of America and its , ideals is not on the battlefield but in the classroom . " Of all the subjects taught in our schools , it seems to me that American history offers the greatest challenge to imaginative young minds . More important , it also offers the best insurance that young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material riches which underlie the strength of America .
