txt Republican leaders cleared the way tonight for exempting $500,000,000 from New York City 's debt limit for school construction after 1960 . But they decided to attach a legislative string to the exemption : the amount of exempt debt that may be issued in any one year will be subject to legislative restriction . Senator Walter J. Mahoney , Republican of Buffalo , and Assemblyman Oswald D. Heck , Republican of Schenectady , announced the Republican decision to back the exemption tonight . Senator Mahoney is the majority leader of the Senate , and Mr. Heck the Speaker of the Assembly . Bill to Be Offered at Once A new constitutional amendment to authorize the exemption , subject to the Legislature 's right to limit its use , is to be introduced at once . It can be brought up for a vote some day next week . Mayor Wagner and City Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa are at odds on the need for such a debt exemption . At the recent state budget hearing Mr. Wagner appealed for its approval . Mr. Gerosa said afterward that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cause a substantial rise in New York City 's real estate tax rate . Democratic bills to approve the exemption have been pending before the Legislature for several years . They have been sponsored by Senator Samuel L. Greenberg of Brooklyn and Assemblyman Melville E. Abrams of the Bronx . Unlike the new Republican measure they would give the city full discretion on the use of the exemption . The Republican leaders are considering authorizing a legislative inquiry into New York 's school construction needs as a supplement to the exemption , but have reached no decision yet . They have information that construction costs have been inflated by changes in designs and " extras " ordered by the Board of Education after contracts have been let . There are several reasons for the proposed legislative restriction on the amount of the exemption that may be used in any one year . One is a desire to bar the city from using the exemption as an excuse to divert borrowing capacity within the debt limit to less essential uses . Another is a determination to see that the funds obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some Republicans are highly critical of the use to which funds obtained by the city in 1951 under a $500,000,000 debt exemption for subway construction have been put . The announced purpose of the subway debt exemption was to finance a Second Avenue line in , ' Manhattan . Instead , the money ' has been used for the purchase of new cars and equipment . An amendment to the State Constitution is needed to grant the exemption . This is because the limit on the amount of debt that New York and other cities can contract is fixed in the Constitution . ' Po become effective , the new Republican measure will require approval at the present legislative session , reapproval at next year 's session and ratification by the voters at a statewide referendum in 1959 . School Board Asks Support The Board of Education urged support yesterday for the bond issue . The board 's endorsement of the debt exemption proposal was contained in a memorandum sent to legislative leaders in Albany . The statement , made public by Charles H. Silver . president of the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the city was to meet its school construction needs . In announcing the board 's position , Mr. Silver said that unless the exemption was approved the funds that would be available in future years for the school building program " will be substantially below the allocations made in recent years . " In each of the last three years , the city has allocated $100,000,000 for school capital needs . Controller Gerosa , besides being opposed to the exemption , has criticized the school system 's consti%ction program . He contends that the city is building new schools , while existing facilities are not fully utilized . School officials have retorted that the under-utilized schools are not in the same areas where new schools are needed . Need is Outlined The school board 's memorandum said that 323 school projects had been undertaken since the start of the city 's post - war school construction program in 1946 . The statement gave the following reasons in support of its endorsement of the exemption proposal : c " The birthrate in New York City , instead of reaching a maximum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 " We are at present using over 200 schools which we deem to he obsolete . C " We have forty schools in use which are unfinished in terms of additions , gymnasiums , lunchrooms and auditoriums. q " We have 37,000 children who are not receiving a full school day because of lack of room . " The board 's memorandum referred to a statement by the City Planning Commission when it submitted its 1958 capital budget recommendations . The statement said : " After . meeting continuing needs for new capacity and special facilities and providing for small-scale rehabilitation and necessary architectural , engineering and administrative expenses , there will be virtually nothing left for replacement of obsolete schools . " Under these circumstances , by the last year of the capital program , 1963 , the city will have more obsolete schools , fifty years old or more , than it has at present  --  approximately 214 whose replacement would cost at least $450,000,000 . " Commenting on the statement , the memorandum declared that " the . kind of limitation indicated in the commission 's statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education . "
