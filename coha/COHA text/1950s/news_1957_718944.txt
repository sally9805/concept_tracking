NEUMANN , INGE-GERD MILLER.ALEXANDER Letters to The Times Israel 's Rights In Aqaba Arab Claims Held to Be Contrary to International Law The writer of the following letter is en international lawyer . He is Associate Professor of Law at Columbia Law School and the author of " Sterling-Dollar Diplomacy . " To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of July 9 properly invoked considerations of justice and common sense in opposition to Arab League claims to bar Israeli shipping from the Gulf ef Aqaba . Your position on this subject is also soundly based on principles of international law , whose application to Aqaba ' may be summarized as follows : Since the Gulf of Aqaba is bounded by several coastal states it is not an internal waterway of those states subject entirely to their jurisdiction . The general rule of international law which supports this conclusion is stated as follows by one of the most authoritative modern sources , Oppenheim , " International Law , " Vol . I ( edited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : " * * * all gulfs and bays enclosed by the land of more than one littoral coastal state , however narrow their entrance may be , are * part of the open sea , the marginal belt territorial waters inside the gulfs and bays excepted . They can never be appropriated ; they are in time of peace and war open to vessels of all nations . * * * " Exception Cited An exception to this rule is possible only when all the coastal states agree , without objection from other states , to regard the bay or gulf not as high seas but rather as their internal waters . Obviously the Gulf of Aqaba does not come within this exception since one of the coastal states  --  Israel  --  insists that the gulf comprises the high seas . Moreover , non-coastal states have not acquiesced in the claim that the gulf is an internal waterway . For example , the United States in its memorandum of Feb. 11 , 1957 , staled that the Gulf of Aqaba " comprehends international waters . " Waters which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high seas . The width of territorial waters in the Gulf of Aqaba is not more than six miles . Since the gulf is considerably more than twelve miles wide at some points , part of its waters must be high seas . It has been the consistent position of the United States that " there is no valid legal basis for claims in territorial waters in excess of three miles . " This position is supported also by the United Kingdom , France and other major countries of Europe and North America . Nevertheless , the countries bordering on the Gulf of Aqaba ( including Israel ) appear to claim a six-mile belt of territorial waters . Even if this claim to an enlargement of territorial waters were recognized , part of the Gulf of Aqaba would still be high seas , since the gulf is approximately seventeen miles wide at its widest point . Passage Through Strait Since the Strait of Tiran connects two parts of the high seas there is a right of innocent passage through the strait even though the strait itself comprises Egyptian territorial waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice declared that a country enclosing a strait used . for navigation between two parts of the high seas had no right to prohibit the passage of foreign shipping through the strait so long as the passage was innocent . This well-established principle was properly applied to the Strait of Tiran by the United States in its memorandum of Feb. 11 . There does not exist a legal state of belligerency between Egypt and Israel . Therefore Egypt has no " belligerent right " to interfere with the passage of ships through the Strait of Tiran . This conclusion follows from the resolution of the , United ? Nations Security Council of Sept. 1 , 1951 , which cited the permanent character of the armistice and concluded that " neither party can reasonably assert that it actively is a belligerent or requires to exercise the right of visit , search and seizure for any legitimate purpose ' of selfdefense . " The conclusion is reinforced by the recent statement of the U. N. Secretary General that in view of the International interest in the gulf " no such claim of belligerency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strait of Tiran . " RICHARD N. GARDNER . New York , July 11 , 1957 . Labor 's Role in Inflation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Edward N. Perkins , in his letter published July 8 titled " Curb on Union Bosses Asked , " allocates responsibility for runaway inflation to union leaders . He suggests as his remedy that the Wagner Act be repealed so that antitrust laws may be applied to them with the effect of preventing strikes for higher wages . Mounting inflation is of grave concern to all segments of our population . But it is regrettable to Dead proposals for its control which are freighted with bias and an inadequate understanding of simple economics . Those who think as Mr. Perkins does should consider that the high consumption on which our prosperity depends can not continue without good wages to supply purchasing power . Experts are agreed that higher wages tend to follow higher prices . Wages actually lag behind prices and , while there is a reciprocal relationship , economists are not agreed that they are the initial cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement , which sets a broad wage pattern , salary levels follow the cost of living . Not long ago in this column Stanley H. Ruttenberg demonstrated the influence on prices caused by the multiplying profit margin taken by steel  --  an industry which raises one of the greatest outcries against labor demands as the cause of higher prices . I should like to conclude by pointing out that while Mr. Perkins appears to agree , that Government controls are undesirable , he proposes legislative action to curb labor but offers no parallel suggestion to regulate industry . It does not seem to me that the writer 's approach contains-the necessary wisdom for the " statesmanlike action " which may be required . MELVIN BLUNT . New York , July 8 , 1957 . Housing Presidential Data Memorial Libraries Believed to Do Disservice to Scholarship To THE EDITOR of THE NEW YORK TIMES : Although Chief Justice Earl Warren has praised the new Truman Library as " a milestone in American history " it should be recognized that these Presidential libraries do a serious disservice to the cause of historical scholarship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . There the Library of Congress has collected the papers of leading political figures associated with the Presidents as well as the papers of many Presidents who died before the vogue for memorial libraries . For the Roosevelt era their collection is already rich and includes such important sourees as the papers of Cordell Hull and Harold Ickes as well as the papers of many important diplomats and military figures . The library also has the only complete sets of Congressional documents , while the National Archives remains the major center for the records of the various Government agencies . Inadequate for Scholars Memorial libraries may be pleasant places to work and their staffs very helpful  --  the Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park sets a high standard  --  but their collections are inevitably inadequate . Scholars using them will find many items which call for immediate further investigation in the official records or in the papers of other individuals . In Washington , with the National Archives and the Library of Congress but a few blocks apart , this is a simple matter . But a student of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excursions to Palo Alto and the Hoover Library , then to Hyde Park and the Roosevelt Library , then to Independence and the Truman Library , and eventually to Abilene and the Eisenhower Library . For all but those few for whom time and money are not limiting considerations this dispersal of the materials is a major obstacle to sustained research . Presidential papers belong in the Library of Congress , and Presidential memorials should remain museums , collecting childhood pictures and other such artifacts for the edification of tourists .

Praise From , Danish Visitor To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TwEs : With regard to the recent ex ? change of letters about New York , may I say that I too am from Copenhagen .

Even though great work is being done to eradicate them , it takes time . During my stay here I have found people extremely nice and helpful . I am returning to Copenhagen shortly , hoping that the picture I now have of the beautiful United States , with its friendly people , will always stay close in my mind . INGE-GERD MILLER .

E. N. Centre for Writers in Exile , American Branch . About a month ago Mr. Nemecek had been re-elected for the year 1957-58 .
