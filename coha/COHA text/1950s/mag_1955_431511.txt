Just a five-minute walk from the Capitol in Washington , D.C. , is a drab , run-down district where vice , poverty and disease flourish . It is not a street in which one might expect to find inspiration . Yet in this slum is enacted daily a moving human drama ? the miracle of wasted lives being salvaged by a dedicated individual whose resources are largely his own ability and faith . He is Llewellyn J. Scott , a soft-spoken Negro just over five feet tall . Scott was born in Washington 50 - odd years ago , the first of five children . His mother worked as a masseuse , his father as a day laborer . They lived a hand-to-mouth existence . Llewellyn developed rickets while an infant , and as a result he could not walk . Among the women whom Mrs. Scott massaged regularly was Mrs. John A. Moore , whose husband was a retired Surgeon General of the Army . One day Mrs. Scott told her about the son who could not walk . Mrs. Moore asked her to bring him along when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the child . She held him on her lap , and the two women talked all afternoon , the massage forgotten . When the boy 's mother left at dusk she left alone . It had been decided that the child would remain with Mrs. Moore . " It was a happy home , " Llewellyn recalls . " General and Mrs. Moore and their children could not have cared for me better had I been horn into the family . Mother and Dad would come to see me every chance they had . Relieved of her deep concern over me , Mother could devote more attention to her other children . " The Moores were determined that young Scott should walk . The Gen- eral called in medical colleagues for consultations and they mapped out a program . It was a long , tough battle . " Many times I became discouraged and would have stopped trying if it had not been for those wonderful people worrying over me , " Scott says . Eventually , when he was ten years old , Scott walked . " That first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bed and stood alone on my own two feet , tears streaming down my face , " he recalls . " I wondered if any other boy in the world had ever been as happy as I was at that moment . " Now the Moores could send the boy to school . An apt pupil , he caught up with his contemporaries by the time he graduated from high school . When World War I broke out he went to France as a volunteer . At 25 he enrolled in a liberal-arts course at Howard University and later took a job teaching Negro farm children in nearby Maryland . This gave him a zest for social work . " Here at last was a way to repay the world for being so good to me , " he says . When the depression of the 1930 's hit , helping the down-and-out became his obsession . He began doing work for the District of Columbia 's emergency relief program . In 1935 he decided to establish a house of refuge where the homeless could find a warm bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters for several years until he had enough savings to make a down payment on two adjoining houses . " After the deeds were signed , " Scott said , " I had no money left . But I had happiness and a job to do . " Working at his regular District Government job by day , Scott began devoting all his free time to the hospice . Some of the people he had befriended pitched in with mops and paint brushes . Scott haunted junk heaps for furniture he could repair , and slowly the hospice became habitable . He named it " The Blessed Martin de Porres Hospice , " after a 17th-century South American Negro famed for his humanity and charity . Since Scott 's refuge opened its doors it has been a rare night that found a single bed unoccupied . There are ten bedrooms arranged dormitory-style to sleep 40 men . The rest of the hospice is given over to a chapel , recreation room , dining room , kitchen , laundry and an office and bedroom for himself . Most of the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one leave without a hot meal . He searches the markets for inexpensive foods . The District of Columbia allots him some of the surplus food it is granted by the federal government . " This means I might wind up with nothing but 500 pounds of beans , " Scott said . " I 've invented more ways to cook a bean than anyone else in history . " With World War II , Scott switched to a defense job with the Army . He is still a Pentagon clerk by  | day and a good Samaritan by night . In his 20 years at the hospice , he has brought material and spiritual comfort to some 4000 men , about ten percent of them white . Some stay just one night ; many stay for weeks , and some for months . Scott does n't keep case histories of those he has salvaged . " I am too busy working with the men to enter them in ledgers , " he said . But he often stumbles on his " case histories " unexpectedly . In a New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " graduates . " The man was so delighted to see Scott that he took the little Negro home to meet his wife and children . " When he came to the hospice he was just a drifter without any skills , " Scott recalls . " I had him help me cook , and in three months he was so adept that I got him a job in a restaurant . He has been working steadily ever since . " One of Scott 's most stubborn cases is also one of his most satisfying . " Bill came to me one cold night several years ago . All he had were the shabby clothes on his back and a thirst for whisky . He seemed puzzled when , without questions or lecturing , I gave him some warm stew and a clean bed . In the morning I gave him breakfast and a sweater . " Twice more that week Bill turned up drunk . The last time , after Scott had fed him , Bill asked , " Well , when are you going to start preaching to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott said . " Whenever you feel you need a friend with whom to talk things over , you will find me waiting . " Two weeks later Bill showed up sober . " I 'd like to talk for a while , " he said . They sat up talking almost until morning . Bill had had an unhappy childhood and unsavory companions . He had lost every job because of drink . Bill decided to try to whip his craving . He moved into the hospice and worked there as a handyman . There were times when Bill faltered , but they became fewer and fewer . And always Scott was there , sympathetic , understanding , lending the younger man strength and encouragement . Finally the battle was won . Every few months Scott receives a cheerful letter from Bill , who has now held a trucking job for four years . Recently he was promoted to a supervisory position . Scott is never free from financial worries . His take-home pay from his Army job is $228 a month . He sets aside $200 for payment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help meet operating expenses . " I pray for the rest , " Scott says simply . " Eventually the money turns up . " He recalls with amusement a session he had recently with his butcher . " I had bought about $40 worth of meat for my men , and told the butcher I would pray real hard for the money . When I got his bill at the end of the month he had written at the bottom , Pray and pay . ' I went immediately into the chapel  | and prayed , and then I returned to my desk to open the rest of the mail . There was a letter containing a check for $50 , from a man who had stayed in the hospice ten years before and now was leading a happy , fruitful life . " Scott has unshakable faith in prayer . How else can one explain the bundles of clothing which arrive from unknown donors ? How else can one explain that whereas he used to have to pay two dollars for 25 loaves of old bread , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the men can eat all they want ? Scott makes it a cardinal rule not to preach . " These are not bad ' men , " Scott says ; " they 're just bewildered or unthinking . Talking their problems out with them and Netting them to realize you believe n them is wonderful medicine . " A devout Catholic , Scott urges the men to turn to religion , any religion . Each evening he leads a brief prayer service in the hospice chapel . He encourages the men to attend Sunday services in the church of their choice . As a side line he runs a one-man employment bureau . Frequently Scott applies for the job in a man 's behalf and talks the boss into a trial . His greatest satisfaction is when one of his " graduates " becomes an employer himself and holds out a helping hand to one of Scott 's current " family . " Last winter , in recognition of his service to humanity , Steubenville College , Ohio , awarded him the Poverello Medal for 1954 . The accompanying-citation praised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of charity which filled the life of St. Francis of Assisi . " For a man who did not learn to walk until he was ten years old , Llewellyn J. Scott does a remarkable job of guiding the faltering steps of others .  |
