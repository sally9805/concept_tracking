William Bradford Huie , 43 , is a glib , self-promoting free-lance writer who likes nothing better than to be in hot water . He has attacked everything from college football to the U.S. Navy , and has been denounced as regularly and heatedly as he denounces . Last week in Live Oak , Fla. , Alabama-born Bill Huie was once again in a cauldron of boiling water , and enjoying every spurt of steam . This time the heat was generated by the case of Ruby McCollum . <P> More than two years ago , Ruby McCollum , then 37 , wealthy wife of a Negro gambler and one of the richest Negroes in the area , shot to death Dr. Clifford LeRoy Adams Jr. , 44 , of Live Oak . A white Florida state senator-elect . Adams was the most important politician in Suwannee County , and a man whom local bigwigs said " was gon na be governor , sure . " <P> Guilty of Murder . At her trial , Ruby McCollum testified that " more than a doctor-patient relationship " existed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Ruby McCollum. the father of her fourth child , and she was pregnant with another child of his when she poured four bullets into him . <P> The all-white jury convicted her of murder . Sentence : death in the electric chair . She appealed , and three months ago the State Supreme Court ordered a new trial on the ground that the jury had inspected the murder scene without the judge and Ruby McCollum being present . But Ruby was pronounced insane and , instead of being retried , was sent to a state mental institution . <P> When Huie went to Live Oak to get a magazine story on the McCollum case , he quickly found one suspicious fact : the judge had never let a reporter talk to Ruby McCollum after her arrest . As he dug into it , Huie found the murder threaded deeply into local politics and community life , decided it would make a good book for him . But he found it hard to get material , since " a pitiful , unreasoning fear . . . came to so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . " In the current issue of the Negro monthly Ebony , Huie openly charged that Circuit Judge Hal W. Adams ( no kin to the slain doctor ) has " the racial attitudes of Reconstruction . " Furthermore , said Huie , Adams had been an honorary pallbearer at the doctor 's funeral . <P> Guilty of Contempt . Last month Judge Adams cited Huie for contempt for trying to " bring this court into disrepute . " ; Huie , said Adams , had told the court-appointed psychiatrist that the judge was biased and was mixed up with local gamblers himself . Fortnight ago , at his own trial , Huie denied the charge . " You shoveled out a mess of filth and stuff of scandalous nature against a man who was dead and could n't defend himself , " said Judge Adams . When Huie grinned in court , Judge Adams snapped : " Brother , this is no matter to laugh about . " He found Huie guilty of contempt , fined him $750 plus an estimated $22 for court costs . When Huie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail . Last week , after three days , he was out under $2,500 bond , and announced that he would take his case to the Florida Supreme Court .
