Harvard 's John Kenneth Galbraith , 49. is an economist who has always found a wider audience than his less articulate colleagues . His American Capitalism : the Concept of Countervailing Power was a bestseller in 1952 ; some of its ideas went into the 1956 campaign speeches of Adlai Stevenson , which Galbraith helped write . This week , in The Affluent Society ( Houghton Mifflin ; $4 ) , Galbraith published what he obviously intended to be a searching inquiry into the U.S. economy . Instead , it is a well-written but vague essay with the air of worried dinner-table conversation . <P> What worries Galbraith is " the myth that production is the central problem of our lives . " This concept of social efficiency , says Galbraith. originated in the days of Adam Smith in an era of scarcity . The classic economists have repeated it ; the public has echoed them . Now it is obsolete : the present-day economy not only turns out all the goods needed but spends much of its energy whetting the consumers ' appetites for things they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social balance " is that production , largely in private hands , has far outdistanced services , which Galbraith seems to think are the responsibility of government . Thus there are plenty of vacuum cleaners but few street cleaners , a plethora of automobiles but no place to park . " The more goods people procure , the more trash must be carried away . . . the greater the wealth the thicker the dirt . " <P> What Galbraith says about the lack of parking places will hardly be news to Americans . Nor will anyone argue with the need for better schools , parks , sanitation systems , traffic control . But having pointed his bat at the bleachers , Galbraith steps away from the plate . He never takes a full swing at drafting the program that he implies : that the state , local and federal governments must take a larger role in society . What Galbraith suggests concretely is much more conservative . He believes that the economy can absorb up to 4,000,000 unemployed , proposes a sliding scale for unemployment compensation . He feels that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better communities , and takes to task liberals who resist city and state sales taxes . <P> When the national frenzy for production has abated , Galbraith says , the Government can devote itself to the frontiers of education , science , world development . But these sonorous generalizations are left in the air . Galbraith has found it easier to sketch the problem than provide the answers .
