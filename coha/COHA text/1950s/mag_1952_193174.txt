MY COUSIN RACHEL ( 348 pp. ) - Daphne du Maurier-Doubleday ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> An up &; coming British officer named Frederick Browning* confided to a boat builder in the late ' 30s that he hoped to buy a boat if his wife 's next book turned out a success . No man ever had a sounder basis for hope . His wife is Novelist Daphne du Maurier , and the book she was working on was called Rebecca . <P> The latest Du Maurier novel , My Cousin Rachel ( her tenth in 20 years ) , is no Rebecca , but it is still the stuff of which dreamboats are made . The movies have already bought it for a reported $100,000 , and the Literary Guild has made it the February choice . In the current story market , neither could have made a wiser move . My Cousin Rachel is that comparatively rare thing in present-day writing , an expert blend of suspense , shrewd realism and romantic hokum . <P> What , or who , killed Cousin Ambrose at that sinister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain tumor ? Or was it Rachel , his half-Italian , half-English bride ? Ambrose , a confirmed bachelor and English country gentleman , had gone to Florence for his health , wound up as a bubbling , then a fearful , husband . To Philip , his heir in Cornwall , it all seemed plain as day : Rachel and her sinister adviser Rainaldi had murdered Cousin Ambrose . Then Rachel came to Cornwall on a visit and , in no time , her cute tricks had Philip dancing attendance like a puppet . But when Philip began to get headaches and nearly died , the old questions returned . Was it brain sickness or poison ? Why did Rainaldi show up ? Why did Cousin Rachel allow Philip to think she would marry him , and then back out when he had signed over the estate ? The scene is the Rebecca country 100 years or more ago , the atmosphere is Gothic , the suspense is played out like Florentine silk cord , and the ending comes where most mysteries begin .
