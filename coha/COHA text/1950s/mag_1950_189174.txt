Moscow 's long-suffering moviegoers glowed vindictively : the managers of the city 's neighborhood moviehouses were at last writhing under the official knout . Five first-string reporters from Evening Moscow made a swooping inspection of the theaters , pronounced them dirty , cold , ill-operated and " on a very low cultural level . " <P> There are some 50 moviehouses in Moscow , of which ten are magnificent showplaces chiefly reserved for the Soviet elite . The ordinary Muscovite rarely sees these first-run houses from the inside ; to him , a night at the neighborhood movies is far from magnificent . <P> No Popcorn . If the picture of his choice is a hit , the Moscow moviegoer must buy his tickets at least a week in advance-several weeks for a Sunday show . If he wants to avoid such long-range planning , he can buy tickets from teen-age scalpers who hang around the theaters . <P> The moviegoer who has finally laid his hands on a ticket goes to the theater at least an hour ahead of showtime and waits in a small side-room where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffet counter he can buy tea , Sitro ( lemon pop ) and buterbrody ( sandwiches ) - but no popcorn . There are racks of newspapers and magazines , shelves of books The walls are lined with photo exhibits Instead of the dance band , the smallest theaters offer only a radio . <P> When it is finally time for the movie itself , customers are shown to their seats by usherettes . ( Occasionally the house managers show the zaniness of their U.S counterparts : when the supercolossal Battleship Potemkin was showing in Moscow the usherettes were dressed as sailors . ) Moviegoers sit on unpadded wooden chairs . In the winter the little theaters have some heat , little or no fresh air , great many lice . <P> No Time to Talk . Evening Moscow 's " brigade " of reporters singled out the Express , on Flower Boulevard , for the brunt of their criticism . " The projection hall is in a very pitiful state , " they wrote . " The walls are peeling and dirty , the chairs are broken . The customers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who sit in the last rows get frozen , because the exit into the street is just behind them . The screen can not be seen well from the last rows . When the customers complain , the manager explains : ' You can not see if you are small and the man in front of you is tall . ' " <P> Things are just as bad at the Molot Hammer , on Rusakov Street : " There are piles of dirt in the corners . For four years the same photo exhibit has been shown . Regular customers at the Molot know that exhibit by heart . The newspapers in the reading room are a year old . " Moviegoers may write their gripes in a Complaints Register , but it does not do much good . Reported Evening Moscow 's crusading newsmen : " Once a patron asked a question . Mme. Nosovaya , the cashier , refused to answer him . The manager entered in the book : ' The cashier was too busy ; she had no time to talk . ' "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
