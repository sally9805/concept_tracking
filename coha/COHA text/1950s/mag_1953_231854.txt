Medallion Theater ( Sat . 10 p.m. , CBS-TV ) is a potentially first-rate summer series that , so far , has had trouble getting off the ground . The first program was a painstaking , rather flat dramatization of an episode from Sinclair Lewis ' Arrowsmith . Others have included The Man Who Liked Dickens , starring Claude Rains , a prettied-up version of Evelyn Waugh 's story of a lost explorer held captive by an illiterate half-breed , and Mrs. Union Station , a farce starring June Havoc . The show may have better luck this week with Charles Ruggles in an adaptation of Richard Harding Davis ' The Consul . The commercials plug a different Chrysler Corp . car each week . <P> First Person ( Fri. 8:30 p.m. , NBCTV ) often uses the camera as one of its actors , and leans toward old-fashioned horror stories . Last week 's show was a supernatural melodrama about a numbed victim and a reluctant murderer , but toward the end , the eerie quality dissolved into unexplained silliness . Sponsor : Gulf Oil . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes an effective half-hour of police drama ( from Manhattan files ) , but loses a lot of sting from its resemblance to NBC 's Dragnet ( from Los Angeles iles ) . In its favor , the new show has Actors Everett Sloane and Joan Lorring and Director-Writer Stanley ( Gangbusters ) Niss , an expert at creating minor personalities . 21st Precinct captures the sounds and scenes of everyday police work ; the characters are all underplayed , just like Dragnet ( which pretty much originated that school of radio acting , and has lately begun underplaying its own underplaying ) .
