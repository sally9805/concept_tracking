txt All was quiet at the southern Michigan prison tonight . The holdout group of 169 mutinous convicts , who ended their four day , 2 million dollar riot at 3 p. m. under the terms of an agreement whereby Democratic Gov . G. Mennen Soapy Williams acceded to their every demand , had been tucked into bed by prison officials . Before retiring they dined at the taxpayers ' expense on club and sirloin steaks , mashed potatoes , early June peas , coffee , bread , margarine prison rules forbid butter , chocolate layer cake , and full pints of ' ice cream . Others Eat Sandwiches Meanwhile , the prison 's nonrioting convicts dined on sandwiches and coffee . The sumptuous steak dinner was one of the rioters ' rewards for wrecking the - nation 's largest walled prison . They also had the complete forgiveness of Gov . Williams and prison officials , and the congratulations of Assistant Deputy Warden Vernon Fox , who hailed the affair as presaging a new era in American prisons . When the mutineers were safely back behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to within a half mile of the prison , at the Jackson state police post , to commend his prison officials for their handling of the riot . . Williams Thanks Pollee Present at the police post parley with Williams were Corrections Commissioner Ernest C. Brooks , Warden Julian N. Frisbie , State Police Commissioner Donald J. Leonard , legislators , and others . " I came here to thank the I men who handled the situation for 1 the job they did in bringing it to la conclusion without much bloodshed , " Williams said . One man , a convict , was killed and 11 inljured in the rioting . " The agreement made with the officials must be followed to the Iletter if we are to maintain confidence among the prisoners . At the same time we are not going Ito coddle the prisoners . The people of Michigan do n't relish haw 1 ing their property severely damaged . " No Further Punishment " " However , in the case of many of these prisoners there is no further punishment that can be meted out to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan does not inflict I capital punishment . " I believe the prison officials know their business . " Brooks then remarked that he wanted the governor to know what a fine job Leonard did . Leonard had a few words of praise for the national guard . Nobody said anything in particular about Warden Frisbie , and some observers thought the governor 's attitude toward the warden was rather cool . 50 Troopers On Guard The convicts ' surrender , which began at 3 p. m. , was a dramatic affair enacted under the shotguns and machine guns of 50 state troopers and the eyes and camera lenses of 200 reporters , photografers , and representatives of radio and television . It had been agreed during morning conferences between Dr. Fox , the deputy warden who also is a psychologist , and the riot leaders that the mutineers would emerge from their fortress cell block 15 at 3 p. m. and be marched to the prison-dining hall for their steak dinner . The heavily armed police ranged themselves in an arc around the entrance to the 15 block , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed onto the , roof of the prison administration building overlooking the yard . Warden Friable and several deputies were near the 15 block door . On the stroke of 3 a whistle , apparently some sort of signal , was heard from within the cell block . The heavy doors swung open and five rioters  --  constituting a frisking committee  --  stepped outside to search their fellow mutineers for weapons as they emerged . One by one came the rest of the mutineers , walking slowly backward with hands in the air . After they had been relieved of their weapons  --  and nearly all carried knives of some sort  --  they were formed by the wardens into groups of six or eight and marched to the dining hall . The moat vicious weapon taken from the convicts was a sort of broad-bladed cleaver lashed to the end of a long pole , so ? that it could be swung like a medieval broadax . Wives Greet Guards It took the mutineers half an hour to file out . The last 21 , constituting a committee , then unlocked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , held eight prison guards as hostages . As the last rioters , who included the leaders Earl Ward and Jack Crazy Jack . H y a t t , emerged , trailed by the freed hostages , a cheer rose from the other prison inmates . Bedlam broke out in the main lobby of the prison administration , where some 100 wives , children , and other relatives of the hostage guards had waited hours , uncertain as to the fate of their loved ones . All eight were unharmed . They said they had been treated well and given food , candy , and cigarets while being held prisoners . After dinner the 169 ex-mutineers were led back to their cells , searched once more ? by guards this time  --  for weapons , and then locked up . Thirty-seven were not returned to the 15-block cells they had occupied when the riot began Sunday night , however . The locks on their cells had been broken . Prison authorities said most of the 37 were parole violators , and not to be classified with the hardened desperadoes who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lansing Mich. , April 24 ( iP ) ? State officials declared today the mutineers at southern Michigan prison failed to win immunity from prosecution for crimes committed during the costly riot . The mutineers were promised only there would be no reprisals by the state department of corrections , Gov . G. Mennen Williams said . At the same time , Attorney General Frank C. Millard ordered an immediate investigation of the riot . He declared all crimes will be punished according to law . Investigate Possible Action Milord assigned an assistant to investigate and determine whether any of the prisoners can be charged with kidnaping , malicious destruction of property , rioting , and inciting to riot and assault with intent to murder or do great bodily harm or any other crimes incidental to the rebellion . " No state official , not even the Supreme court , can grant any one immunity for the commission of a crime , " Millard said . " This is not reprisal in any sense but entirely in accordance with the demands of my oath of office . " Millard said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed during the riot . But he said it would be necessary to provide proof which will stand up in court . Governor Explains /tole Explaining the role he played in the final negotiations , Williams said : " Warden Julian Frisbie , Deputy Warden Vernon Fox , and Corrections Commissioner Earnest C. Brooks all agreed the first 10 points demanded by the convicts could be accepted without damage to prison security and discipline . The 11th point was different . It called for no reprisals against the rioters of any kind . Of course , such a commitment was out of the question . " Nobody , not even the governor , could assure these convicts they would not be prosecuted under the laws of the state of Michigan for any unlawful acts committed during the riots at Jackson . Nobody can by any kind of agreement set aside the criminal laws . This was the matter which was discussed all day Wednesday . We could n't agree to sign what the convicts wanted .
