" The four Ministers were unable to reach agreement , " the final Berlin communique said bluntly . Where there was division when the Ministers met-in Ger many , Austria , Europe-division still stayed when they parted . The conference broke up cleanly , and exactly on schedule . No unhappy cleanup party of subcommittee specialists was left behind to carry on . The hard fact was that in Europe at least , nothing was left to discuss . On Asia , the Big Four agreed to meet again , this time with Red China and the other nations who fought in the Korean war , on April 26 in Geneva . <P> On matters European , the final week of the conference gave Russia 's Molotov a dialectical drubbing that he would not soon forget . France 's nimble Georges Bidault , whom Molotov tried hardest to woo , tore into Russia 's plan for an " us Europeans " pact that would shove the U.S. out of Europe , and leave all of Russia in . Snapped Bidault : " Lake Baikal and Vladivostok are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fear of Freedom . " The width of the chasm between East and West on such matters as free elections in Germany and Austria could be measured by two remarks . One was Molotov 's aside to An thony Eden : " What matters is not elections , but what kind of government comes out of the elections . We could not toler ate a government that would be hostile to us . . . " The other was John Foster Dulles ' : " We were willing to place trust in the German and Austrian peoples . The Soviet Union was not . . . The Atlantic Charter to which we all subscribed called for ' freedom from fear . ' Today , unhappily , the dominant note in much of the world is ' fear of freedom . ' " <P> Invitation to Peking . Eight weeks from now the Ministers will gather again in Geneva . Their agenda is already agreed upon , and at U.S. insistence , confined to specific issues : the Korean peace conference ( which 48 days of wrangling at Panmunjom failed to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indo-China . " <P> The Geneva Conference was most of all a victory for France . By agreeing to sit down with the representatives of Red China , John Foster Dulles was deferring not to Molotov but to Georges Bidault , whose performance at Berlin had earned him U.S. gratitude . Time and again , the little Frenchman had risked his political neck by rejecting Soviet blandishments ( e.g. , that France and Russia could " solve " the German problem between them ) in defiance of opinion back home . And when Molotov had tried to speak over Bidault 's head to the French , Bidault sharply replied : " I would remind Monsieur Molotov that I am the Foreign Minister of <P> France , and so long as I hold that office , it is for me to interpret French opinion . " Now Dulles was alarming U.S. allies in Asia ( Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek ) , and risking the displeasure of many Americans ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , in agreeing to talk about Indo-China . <P> Sooner or later , Dulles knew , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations with the Communists . In a European city , with the U.S. and Britain at his side , Bidault would be in a far stronger position than he would alone in Asia . And U.S. participation would make it difficult for the French to make the settlement too easy on the Communists .
