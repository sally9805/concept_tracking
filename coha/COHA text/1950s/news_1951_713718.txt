txt The other day there appeared in the editorial columns of The Daily Record of Stroudsburg , Pa. , a letter from Irvin F. Angle , of nearby Portland , Pa . We recommend it to all those interested in the subjects of inflation and prosperity . Here it is : Once there was a farmer who raised corn and a man who raised hens , but no corn . The hens said no corn , no eggs . So the man agreed to work for the farmer one day a week for S5 a day . And the farmer agreed to sell corn to the man for Si a bushel . They paid each other off every time with the long green . The farmer paid the man S5 and the man paid the $5 back to the farmer for the five bushels of corn which he wheeled home in his wheelbarrow . After a while , the man said to the farmer , " everything 's gone up , and I regret intensely to inform you that I ca n't work for less than S6 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , you must understand that everything 's going up with me , too , and I regret intensely to inform you that I ca n't sell you my corn for less than $1.20 a bushel . " The man said he understood . So . the man got $6 a day and at $1.20 a bushel paid the farmer the $6 for five bushels of corn . Both of them said " happy days are here again . " By and by the man said to the farmer , " things have gone up still more and I ca n't work for less than $7.50 a day . " The farmer agreed that was fair , but told the man that things were going up still higher with him : He would have to get $1.50 a bushel for the corn . The man agreed that was fair and both said " prosperity is her .. " After all , the man was getting $7.50 a day . The farmer was getting $1.50 a bushel for corn , and the hens were getting five bushels as always . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and the farmer got $2 a bushel and the man gave the farmer $10 for five bushels . And the nens kept right on laying even on ThUrsdays and the man told his wife , " ai n't it wonderful ... $10 a day . " And the farmer told his wife , " ai n't it wonderful . . . $2 a bushel . " And the hens kept clucking away on five bushels of corn . And the statisticians down Washington way said , " ai n't it wonderful . . . national income at record levels . " And the politicians said " ai n't it wonderful " and bragged that they had done it . And everybody felt so good and prosperous that the man and the farmer voted for the politicians and that is how it was " eggsactly . " The man got three times as much for the eggs , but paid three times as much for his shoes , and the music went round and round .                @ @ @ @ @
