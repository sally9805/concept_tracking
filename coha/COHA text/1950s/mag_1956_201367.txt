The heroic , traditional act of bailing out with a parachute is getting less and less popular as airplanes fly faster and higher . Pilots have landed alive ( though in poor condition ) after bailing out above the speed of sound ( TIME , Nov. 21 ) , but according to experts of the Office of Naval Research , no ejection-seat and parachute combination can save a pilot flying more than 1,900 m.p.h. at 70,000 ft . Less speed would be fatal at lower altitudes , because the thicker air would hit the pilot with a harder decelerating jolt . <P> At last week 's Chicago meeting of the Aero Medical Association , the Navy and Douglas Aircraft Co. described their solution to the high-speed bail-out problem : a detachable cockpit . It would form the whole nose of the airplane and would contain all the expensive instruments and electronic gadgets , which are nice to salvage along with the pilot . It would also be standardized , so that the same cockpit would fit the bodies of many different airplanes . <P> When a bail-out is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsule cockpit separates neatly from the rest of the airplane . Since the pilot is still behind a streamlined windbreak , he does not get the full impact of deceleration . A small parachute opens and keeps the capsule headed into the wind . When it has slowed down enough , a big parachute opens and lowers it to the ground . <P> While in the air the pilot still has his oxygen supply and air pressure , as well as protection from cold . If he happens to land in water , the capsule floats , and a stabilizing weight ( the airplane 's battery ) is lowered to give it a heavy keel and make it reasonably seaworthy . <P> Preliminary experiments performed by Douglas have been encouraging , and the capsule cockpit is now approaching the practical testing stage . Besides saving pilots ' lives , it has other advantages . It can be used as a training device , and dress rehearsals for combat missions can be performed with formations of pilots sitting safe in grounded cockpits and going through the motions . <P> The Navy does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it does not expect it to solve all problems , such as an enemy hit on the cockpit itself . " In many cases , however , " says Douglas Engineer Albert Mayo , " it will enable the pilot to survive . It will not guarantee him a comfortable bailout , and if the jet is headed earthward at Mach 2 and 6,000 ft. off the deck , nothing can save him . "
