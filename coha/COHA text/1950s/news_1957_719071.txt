txt Boston faces an $89 tax rate this year and a $95.50 rate next year if Mayor Hynes does n't get legislative approval for his $45 , - 000,000 deficit refinancing bill . City Auditor Joseph P. Lally confirmed this today and said that the record-high tax rate was the only alternative to passage of the trouble-ensnared bill . That the Legislature will have a chance to vote on the bill became virtually certain yesterday when Governor Furcolo told a press conference he was willing to send in a special message on it if necessary . On gubernatorial messages , admission of a bill is automatic . On Aug 19 the House Rules Committee is scheduled to deliver an adverse report which would block consideration of the bill . It is understood that the measure 's supporters in the Legislature have been unable lo marshal enough votes either io obtain reconsideration of the 7-to-1 adverse committee vote or overturn the committee report with a four-fifths vote of the House . The Senate Rules Committee had voted to admit the bill . Reduction Possible There is a good chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or $88 , if the State Commissioner of Taxation approves the city 's appeal for a $2,000,000 increase in ? its estimated income and corporation tax collections this year . This is still far above the 1956 tax rate of $78.70 . Boston tax-payers already carry the heaViest tax burden in the state . According to Mr. Lally , the 1958 rate can not avoid going well into the mid-90 's for the following reasons : I. Tax abatements already granted by the Appellate Tax Board will raise the amount needed in the overlay reserve fund established for just such a purpose by an additional $4 , - 200,000 . These were granted to the John Hancock Mutual Insurance Company , the New England Telephone &; Telegraph Company , the Boston Gas Company , the Boston &; Albany Railroad , the New Haven Railroad , and the Boston Terminal Corporation . Pay Boast Effective 2 . City emplOyees will receive salary increases of $1 , - 500,000 beginning Sept. 1 but during 1958 the whole $4,500 , - 000 will have to be appropriated ? $3,000,000 more than this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit is expected to be up another $1,200,000 , according to present indications . 4 . Increases to school personnel are expected to cost another $750,000. 5 . Increased disbursements to welfare recipients arc expected to be up another $965,000 next year . These were ordered by the State Department of Public Welfare to keep up with the cost of living . Added together , these increased city expenditures alone indicate that the city will spend 10 million dollars more next year than it will this year . This is $6.50 more on the tax rate . An $89 rate for 1957 would be raised to $95.50 in 1958 as a result . No new or increased state taxes this year is the firm policy of the House Committee on Ways and Means as it continues to wield a heavy ax on Governor Furcolo 's 20-million-dollar supplementary budget . Despite this determination , the committee is expected to restore much of a rejected 2.9-million-dollar item to finance extra ? salary hikes won by employees through appeals from pay schedules set up under the 1956-adopted Barrington reclassification program . Although the extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee , it is understood that total will still be kept well below any level requiring new or increased tax levies . Ir fact , committee members are intent on producing a surplus for use in financing some work which might otherwise be included in the capital outlay bond issue , committee spokesmen report . Action Reversed Representative . John . T. Toomey ( D ) of Cambridge , committee chairman , has a subcommittee working on the salary situation . Although the full committee originally voted to defer financing of any appeal-won salary hikes until all appeals are finally processed , probably in February , 1958 , now the committee plans to provide supplementary budget funds for those salaries fully processed . A subcommittee member reported that the current plan is to reinsert in the budget sufficient funds to cover those salary increases recommended by the State Director of Personnel and approved by the appeals board . This is headed by Ernest A , Johnson . State Commission of Labor and Industries , established to process appeals . Budget . Being Slashed Howevei. , those increases which throw out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , as well as increases the committee believes are much to large . Many of the increases now before the committee are $1,000 to $2,000 or more , and the subcommittee is making its own study to determine their validity and their effect on the whole salary setup . The change in committee policy on salary adjustments came after a public hearing at which representatives of organized state employees criti cized the earlier committee action on the 2.9-million-dollar , item . They urged financing in the supplementary budget of those increases already processed and approved at the necessary levels . Meanwhile , the full committee , working under Mr. Toomey , continues slashing operations on the budget , endeavoring to trim it down to current revenue proportions . The Governor had recommended eight million dollars in new taxes , including a onecent-a-package extra tax on cigarettes , elimination of the state income tax exemption on dvidends of trusts having trans-departmental fees . However , the Legislature already has passed a measure for increased fees . The committee plans to squeeze the Governor 's requests so hard that a surplus will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aiming to use that surplus in a way to prevent the Governor from applying it to new projects adding substantially to the permanent cost of state government . Whatever surplus is made available will be applied to capital outlay items which should be financed out of current revenue rather than by bond issues . For years Norman , executive director of the Massachusetts Federation of Taxpayers Associations , has clamored against putting in the capital outlay program such items as repairs and maintenance of state property . He has insisted that those expenses should be met through current revenue . Committee Agrees The committee agrees with him and plans to follow that policy as far as available funds will permit . ? The committee still is awaiting the Governor 's capital outlay message . It has been promised in time for the next lull session of the House , Aug. 19 . Thus , before bringing out the supplementary budget , the committee will have before it the Governor 's bond issue proposals for state building construction . From it , the committee can lift the items it believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final size of the supplementary budget , the authorized budget total for the current fiscal year will be record high . The regular budget , already law , totaled $380,550 , - 833 , far above the previous record-high , 363-million-dollar total for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1957 . Slop-Rate Increases Even if the city is permitted to shave a dollar or two from this year 's rate , the tax rate next year is still expected to be above $95 in 1958 , if only for the reason that mandatory step-rate increases to eligible city personnel will boost the city 's costs still higher . TO avoid this punitive tax rate , Mayor Hynes is putting pressure on Boston legislators to line up in support of the refinancing bill . He has written to seven or eight members of the Boston delegation urging them to use their influence in the House Rules Committee and has been in close touch with leading bankers in the city to bring their influence to bear . One of the Boston legislators left off the Mayor 's list was John T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority whip and prime mover ' against admission of the Mayor 's bill . Mr. Tynan , who is usually on the side of Senator John E. Powers ( D ) also of South Boston , Senate minority leader , and a &lender; of the bill , in this instance has taken a public position opposite to that of his usual ally . Reluctant to Ask Aid There has been some reluctance on the part of the Mayor 's advisers to ask Governor Fur-cola to back the 45-million-dollar debt refinancing legislation . His legislative program already has suffered many setbacks at The hands of Democratic legislators , and Boston officials are not anxious to become responsible for another one . There is also some feeling among businessmen and City Hall observers who would not he adversely affected politically that there might be some benefits to be derived from letting the high tax rates go through . Boston might thereby be pushed to reform , it is felt .
