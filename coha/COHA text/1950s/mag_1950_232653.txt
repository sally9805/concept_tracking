In the Indonesian 's atlas the western part of New Guinea is called Irian . No one is quite sure what the word signifies . One theory is that it means nothing , another that it means " warm land . " It is , indeed , a torrid jungle and mountain wilderness as big as California . Sparsely inhabited by fuzzy-wuzzy Melanesian cannibals and practically unexploited , it has been a Dutch colony the past 122 years . Last week Irian was also a hot focus of argument between its Dutch rulers and the bumptious young Republic of Indonesia . <P> The dispute began in the postwar struggle of the Indies . When the Dutch recognized Indonesia 's independence ( in November 1949 ) , it was agreed that the status of Irian , which both countries claimed , would be settled at a conference to be held within a year . <P> As months passed and conference time approached , Irian became more &; more involved in local Indonesian politics . President Soekarno insisted the controversial territory must belong to Indonesia . It was a popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it helped detract attention from such internal difficulties as banditry and inflation . <P> The Australians , who rule East New Guinea , backed the Dutch ; they let it be known that they would rather take over the island 's western half than see it in Indonesian hands . <P> Against this background last week Dutch and Indonesian representatives met in The Hague for the parley that would determine Irian 's destiny . Soekarno 's men , led by Foreign Minister Mohamed Rum , demanded control within six months . Led by Foreign Minister Dirk Stikker , The Netherlands ' men testily replied that they could not negotiate on the basis of such a proposal . They argued , in effect , that they were more capable and responsible colonial administrators than the untried Indonesians , and that West New Guinea 's primitive inhabitants needed their benevolent aid . " Whoever calls this task of civilization colonialism , " a Dutch spokesman said , " uses an ugly qualification for a splendid task . " <P> The Indonesians sniffed suspiciously and rejected the Dutch answer . This week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise .
