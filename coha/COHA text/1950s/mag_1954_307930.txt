It was a cold , raw afternoon , but more than 500 well-wishers turned out at Ottawa 's Rockcliffe Airport to see Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent take off last week on a round-the-world good-will tour . As the Prime Minister 's limousine pulled up at the airstrip , they broke through the rope barriers in a rush of friendly enthusiasm . St. Laurent , politely doffing his black Homburg , plunged into the crowd , shaking hands and alternately bidding goodbye and au revoir as he worked his way toward the plane . <P> Just before the doors , closed on the big silver and red R.C.A.F. transport , the crowd gave three cheers and a tiger . The four propellers blew back a shower of powdery snow ; the plane taxied out to position and roared down the runway . Next day St. Laurent was in London for lunch and a short talk with Prime Minister Churchill . This week he was scheduled to go on to Paris and Bonn , visit Canadian army and air force bases , then continue the six week , 30,000-mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Delhi , Colombo , Jakarta , Manila , Seoul and Tokyo .
