As publisher of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram , Amon G. ( for Giles ) Carter , devout Texan , found it easy to explain his paper 's success . " We get out a newspaper , " he said , " that fits our city . " Carter 's formula , while it did not make the Star-Telegram a famous daily , made it a good one . But his rare combination of showmanship , artful buffoonery and open-handed generosity virtually made Cow-Town Fort Worth a city . Dressed in his ten-gallon hat and cream-colored polo coat , Amon Carter sang Fort Worth 's praise all over the world , while passing out silver dollars , hats , 100-lb. watermelons and boxes of pecan nuts for remembrances as he went along . On his Shady Oak Farm , he often had as many as 2,000 guests as an audience for his salesmanship . Outsiders half-seriously began to call Fort Worth " Cartersville , " with some justification ; fully a fourth of the city 's 300,000 population work in factories , businesses and offices which have moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The West Begins . Even in Texas , where local pride and hospitality are an article of common faith , no one could match Carter 's . Once , inviting a group of out-of-towners to visit Fort Worth , Carter wired with typical hospitality : " Carry only what money you need before you get to Texas . You will not be able to spend a dime in the state . " <P> Carter 's devotion to the Star-Telegram and its city was matched only by his scorn for Dallas , 30 miles away . Nothing pleased him more than his slogan for Fort Worth ( " Where the West Begins " ) , especially when he could add that Dallas was really for effete Easterners . Carter always refused to buy anything in Dallas , including food ; on his rare visits to Dallas he proudly carried a box lunch . To make Fort Worth an aviation center , he became the largest single stockholder in American Airlines , moved its headquarters from Dallas to Fort Worth . The name of <P> Fort Worth 's new $12 million airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good humor , thought ( as did Amon Carter ) that the competition was good for both cities . Said the Dallas Morning News : " Carter punched Dallas like cowboys are wont to do slow steers in a shipping chute . " <P> Have Another Drink . One punch Carter struck was against a plan to build a new railroad terminal for Fort Worth that was no better than Dallas ' . Carter stoutly opposed the plan , one evening got a call from Railroad Magnate Matthew C. Brush in New York , who said : " Well , we 've just voted to build your damn Union Station . We 're going to put up $11 million for the biggest station and shops and terminal in the Southwest . And now we 're all drinking to your health . What do you say about that ? " Amon Carter promptly replied : " Have another drink . "
