The top game of the week for 40,000 Atlanta fans and millions of televiewers matched the undefeated engineers of Georgia Tech , the nation 's No. 2 team , and the Crimson Tide of Alabama , No. 12 ; for a while at the start , a 200-proof shocker of an upset seemed in the making . Aroused Alabama , threatening time &; again , scored a first-period field goal and kept the vaunted Tech attack bottled up . <P> Not until the second period did the sputtering Georgia Tech offense , handicapped by the loss of injured Star Halfback Leon Hardeman , finally get untracked . With a pair of downfield blockers paving the way , Hardeman 's substitute , Dick Pretz , ripped around right end for 11 yds. and a touchdown . That was all the scoring for the day , but Tech 's fast , rangy ( 191 lbs . average ) defensive platoon bent to its task with ferocious tackling and held Alabama at bay . Final score : 7-3 . <P> Georgia Tech , a two-touchdown favorite , had played its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the marks of a champion to win even on the off-days . Instead of being displeased , Tech Coach Robert Lee Dodd , easy and relaxed , gave credit to the other team rather than blaming his own . Said Dodd : " We 're not too disappointed . After seeing the way Alabama played , we were extremely happy to win it at all . " The remark summed up Dodd 's whole coaching thesis : " I coach just like I would want to be coached if I was back in college-and the way I 'd like my son to be coached . " At Georgia Tech , they come as close as any big-league squad can to playing football for plain fun . <P> Tech practice sessions are limited to an hour and a half , and the players seldom scrimmage after September . Says Dodd : " What can a good football player get out of knocking himself out blocking a freshman at practice when he played against an All-American last week ? " Dodd 's ten-man staff of assistants , one of the biggest coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attention and a minimum of tough talk . <P> The Dodd system contradicts many of the theories of the hell-for-leather big-time college coaches . And though Tech does its best to lure good players , Dodd must constantly cope with the hard fact that the tough engineering school has no snap courses like those found in some of the football foundries . How does Dodd consistently stay on top of the collegiate heap ? The former All-American quarterback for Tennessee ( 1930 ) has a twinkle in his grey eyes when he answers that one : " Do n't forget , we get the smarter boys-and that helps . " It also helps that Dodd 's Sugar Bowl-bound engineers seem to enjoy playing football for him . <P> <P> Georgia Tech 's Sugar Bowl opponent , Mississippi , pulled the upset of the week by downing unbeaten Maryland , No. 3 in the polls , 21-14 . Michigan State , No. 1 , held its rank by toppling Notre Dame , 21-3 . And Michigan , upsetting Purdue 21-10 , took over the lead ( tied with Wisconsin ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
