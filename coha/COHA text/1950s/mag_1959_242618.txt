For " technical " reasons , said the Vatican 's Osservatore Romano last week , the Holy See has withdrawn diplomatic privileges from the envoys of the Polish and Lithuanian pre-war governments . Henceforth , the dean of the Vatican diplomatic corps , Casimir Papee , Ambassador from the Polish government in exile , and Stanislaus Girdvainis. minister from Lithuania before Russia annexed that country in 1940 , will probably serve as chargs d'affaires . But no matter how technical the reasons , insiders in Rome buzzed with speculation that the move signaled a new phase of diplomatic relations between Vatican and Kremlin . <P> When the envoys accredited to the Holy See were invited by diplomatic custom to present their credentials to the new Pope , Pape and Girdvainis received no invitations . Vatican Secretary of State Domenico Tardini explained that the omissions were made because the two diplomats represented " phantom " governments that are no longer recognized by other countries accredited to the Holy See . That statement itself was enough for old Vatican hands to sense a new atmosphere ; under Pius XII , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envoys as anti-Communist symbols , there had not been any reference to phantoms . <P> The change is said to have been brought about at least partly by Poland 's Cardinal Wyszynski during his recently-completed 22-month visit to Rome . As the church 's highest-ranking prelate who deals with Communism at first hand , Wyszynski is said to have made this case to Pope John and Cardinal Tardini : Polish Premier Gomulka is increasingly dependent on Poland 's Catholics ( 82.4% of the population ) to keep him at least partly independent of Moscow 's smothering embrace , and the situation might be used to pry from Gomulka some additional concessions to Polish Catholics . But one of Wyszynski 's embarrassments in such maneuvers was recognition of the exiled Polish representatives by the Vatican . <P> The new Vatican attitude , as one diplomat put it , " could theoretically lead to a better atmosphere between the church and Communism . The first move , though , must come from the Communists . " The church 's price is likely to be high , involving vastly increased religious and educational freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
