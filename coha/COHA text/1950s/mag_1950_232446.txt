Black Hand ( MGM ) is a minor triumph of production over plot . A slow , overlong melodrama about the bomb-throwing extortionists who terrorized Manhattan 's Little Italy around the turn of the century , the story is so familiar that it might be a rehearsal for a movie about gangsters of a later era . But the film 's vivid sets , new faces and , most of all , richly atmospheric photography help to give it a fresh look . <P> Filmed in sharp contrasts of shadow and brightness , Black Hand evokes its period and locale with shabby , tin-ceilinged tenement flats and narrow streets swarming with immigrant life . With considerable effect , it conveys the ruthlessness of the Black Hand gang , the fear of the victims and the helplessness of police in whom no one dares to confide . <P> The mood proves strong enough to survive the story , though at times it almost flickers away . A young Italian immigrant ( Gene Kelly ) sets out to avenge his father , who was murdered by the gang for trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browbeaten community into resistance , Kelly is flung by the hoodlums into the first mass meeting , battered , bleeding and almost dead . Then he hits on the more cautious idea of sending a veteran Italian-American detective ( J. Carrol Naish ) to Italy to dig up criminal records that will enable the U.S. to deport its immigrant thugs . <P> The idea eventually pays off in a blaze of heroics and dynamite . But not until Kelly has gotten himself out of a picturesque Black Hand cell : a butcher 's icebox where piles of homemade bombs nestle among the sides of beef . <P> Ruthless pruning might have made Black Hand taut and incisive enough to deserve the loving care with which it was put together . As it is , the picture flares occasionally into what it might have been , e.g. , a courtroom scene in which a crucial witness falters under a small gesture from the spectators ' rows . Dancer Kelly proves capable in a straight role and gets the support of a good cast . As the frustrated detective who has spent 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gem of a scene as he drunkenly celebrates his first victorious skirmish . <P> Mother Do n't Tell Me ( 20th Century-Fox ) is a comic elaboration of one of the hard facts of medicine : it 's tough to be a doctor 's wife . In milking it for laughs , Scripter-Director Claude Binyon manipulates the fact into arrant Hollywood fiction , and too often forces the comedy into farce . But thanks mostly to an ingratiating performance by Dorothy McGuire , the movie passes the time pleasantly .
