The first big U.S. luxury liner built since 1939 slid down the ways of Bethlehem 's shipyards at Quincy , Mass , last week . She was American Export Lines ' 1,000-passenger , $25 million S.S. Independence . Everybody agreed that she was a thing of beauty , fast , sleek and fancy . Britain 's Queens ( which average 28-knots ) could outrun her , but the ship 's 25-knot top speed made her the swiftest thing afloat in the U.S. merchant marine . <P> Industrial Designer Henry Dreyfuss had planned her fittings , which will take until next January to complete , to combine luxury with some of the casual comfort of a modern U.S. home . Features : staterooms with sofa berths which make them convertible into daytime sitting rooms ; " penthouse " apartments ( living room , bedroom , two baths , two dressing rooms and private terrace ) ; air-conditioning throughout , including the roomy quarters for the 578-man crew . There are shops , restaurants , cocktail bars , a gymnasium , nursery , theater , library , swimming pool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountain . With the Independence and her twin sister Constitution , to be launched in September , American Export will offer U.S. tourists a crossing from New York to Genoa in eight days .
