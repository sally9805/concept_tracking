SIX GREAT MODERN SHORT NOVELS ( 448 pp. ) - James Joyce , Herman Melville , Katherine Anne Porter , Nikolai Gogol , Glenway Wescott , William Faulkner-Dell ( paperback , 50 ) . <P> The unwary drugstore customer who picks up a shiny paperback called Six Great Modern Short Novels may be disconcerted to discover that it actually contains six great modern short novels . Ordinarily , he may be no more likely to buy the hard-cover editions of these works than he would be to go shopping for a pack of otter hounds or a brocade waistcoat . But if he reads this volume , undeterred by the crepitation of bursting glue from the spine , he will have exposed himself to more first-class writing than can be found on the entire 1954 fiction list of U.S. and British publishers . <P> The word modern does not mean in publishing what it means in the used-car business . Some of these novels are definitely vintage models which first startled the highbrow highways more than a quarter century ago . Nor do they necessarily provide a joy ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a depressing Christmas party in lace-curtain Dublin ; in Melville 's Billy Budd , Foretopman , the hanging of a sailor aboard a British man-of-war of the Hornblower period ; in Porter 's Noon Wine , the madness and death of a farmhand and the suicide of a farmer in horse-and-buggy Texas ; in Gogol 's The Overcoat , the acquisition and loss of an overcoat by a clerk somewhere in pre-revolutionary Russia ; in Wescott 's The Pilgrim Hawk , the liberation and recovery of a hunting falcon in the garden of an expatriate lady somewhere in France ; and in Faulkner 's The Bear , the pursuit of an unusually large bear in the boondocks of post-bellum Mississippi . <P> Certain objections may occur to the reader . The Irish are a pretty dismal lot , to hear Joyce tell it , and Faulkner 's hunting story doubles on its tracks even more than necessary to follow a slow-footed beast . It is no longer news that Russians ( then or now ) have trouble getting overcoats , and rich characters who keep predatory birds about the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the reader will also sense that in all six stories something more important than bears , hawks and overcoats is being talked about . His feelings may focus on the sea story , Billy Budd . If he has seen the film The Caine Mutiny and read the novel , he may become aware that both stories are about the same sort of thing , but that Billy is a tragedy while The Caine Mutiny is a tempest in a large and interesting teapot . Billy Budd carries echoes of the vocabulary of Lincoln and of a time when the great issues were debated at the top of men 's voices , in the richest words at their command . And Billy Budd 's themes , often thought to be peculiarly modern-the individual and the state , innocence and authority-are far better expressed in the moral , oratorical , Biblical jargon of Melville than in the journeyman prose of Herman Wouk . <P> All six novels-a bargain at less than a dime each-meet not on the bestseller list , but on literature 's highest common denominator . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faulkner as " the human heart in conflict with itself ... the old verities and truths of the heart , the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed-love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice .
