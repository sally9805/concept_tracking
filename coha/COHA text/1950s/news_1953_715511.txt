txt WASHINGTON , June ** Robert A. Taft of Ohlod who is suffering from a serious but not fully diagnosed illness , turned over his day-by-day duties as the Senate Republican floor , ileader today to Senator William F. Knowland of California . Mr. Taft , the most powerful roan in - Congress and the Capitol spokesman for the dominant wing of his party , yielded reluctantly because of a hip condition and demands of physicians that he no longer could ignore . However , " Mr. Republican "  --  a name popularly given to the threetime contender for his party 's Presidential nomination  --  made it clear he was by no means abdicating and that he would continue to be the Republican leader of the Senate . He told reporters that , subject to the necessities of a series of X-ray treatments he must take , he would continue to attend the White House conferences of President Eisenhower and the Republican leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives , and the meetings of the Senate Republican policy committee . The Ohioan transferred to Senator Knowland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate floor , , but will remain active at the points where high party policy is ma de . Mr. Knowland becomes the acting leader ; Mr , Taft continues to be the leader . The news of the Senator 's decision , and the acknowledgment of his " serious " ' ailment , saddened and perturbed the Senate . Until late in the day it was not mentioned on the floor . The si // lence finally was broken by Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , the Democratic leader . Mr. Johnson , Mr. Taft 's favorite partisan antagonist across a two-foot aisle ' ) dividing the chamber , told the Senate : " In or out of the leader 's chair I know and you know that Bob Taft will be working for the good of the nation . No more honorable man ever sat as a Senate leader for any party . " It would be privilege and a pleasure . " Mr. Johnson added , to work with Mr. Knowland as Mr. Taft 's deputy . The first notice of what was afoot came just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taft 's executive assistant , sent to the press gallery this statentent : " Senator Taft returned to the Senate today after a further consultation regarding his hip condition with leading doctors . Talks With Reporters " They advised him that the condition is a serious one , and that while he can attend the Senate and keep up his work there , he will have to take a good deal of rest and pursue a course of treatment which will prevent his being active as floor leader during the balance of the session . " A minute or so after the opening bells of the Senate had rung . Mr. Taft came into the chamber on crutches and went not to his usual seat as Majority Leader  --  a seat that had been occupied for about the last two weeks by Mr. Knowland  --  but to one near by . Senator Taft said a few words to an old friend , Senator George D. Aiken , Republican of Vermont , smiled and then took a place beside Mr. Knowland . The Ohioan remained there for about five minutes and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lounge called the President 's Room to answer questions . He said that he had taken an airplane to New York last night for an examination by two medical specialists , whose names he preferred not to give out . This was the third examination since Mr. Taft 's left hip had begun troubling him , a trouble that began , as he recalled , about April 15 . Before yesterday , he had undergone clinical tests at a hospital in Cincinnati and at Walter Reed Army Hospital here . Told of Hip Lesion ' The Senator , seated on a leather divan , his face drawn , observed : " I have asked Bill Knowland to go on as the Acting Floor Leader . I will continue , however , to be at the Presidential meetings , Policy Committee meetings . and so forth ? unless some specific treatment should prevent on some specific day . " They the doctors insist that I give first priority to getting well . " He said several times that none of his physicians had been able to tell him what was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went on : " I said to them , ' What is a lesion ; is it a crack in the bone ? ' They said no , that a lesion is anything that is wrong with a bone . That is all I got out of them . " They were very strong that I not . put any weight on that hip . " " The trouble , " Mr. Taft told the reporters , had first been noticed after he ' had " been out whaling golf balls . " But he said , with a grin , no one must blame anything on " Burning Tree , Augusta or General Eisenhower . " The President has played golf with the Senator at the Burning Tree Club near here and at Augusta , Ga . Mr. Taft made it unmistakably clear that Senator Knowland , who is chairman of the Policy Committee , was his personal choice to be Acting Leader . He observed , with a slight emphasis on the ' pronoun , " it was I who appointed him . " By this , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Republican side of the Senate that might develop . Ordinarily , a party whip , or assistant leader  --  in this case Senator Leverett Saltonstall of Massachusetts  --  acts in the absence of his chief . Senator Taft concluded his short interview by saying that he and Mrs. Taft had hoped to go to Ireland this fall to " visit Bill , " ? their son , William Howard Taft 3d , the Ambassador to Dublin . " Now , " he said , tentatively , " I do n't know about Bill ; I just do n't know . I hope so . " He regained his feet then , arranged his crutches , and went off . His assistant , Mr. Martin , disclosed that in addition to X-ray treatment cortisone would be given the Senator and that , characteristically , Mr. Taft had found himself unable to go all the way with his doctors , who obviously had wanted him to quit work for a while . " What he ought to do , " said Mr. Martin , " is to stay off that hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , not , only had to be rested but " rebuilt . " The situation inevitably created all manner of worried speculation in the Senate , and in both parties , and it put a heavy responsibility on Senator Knowland who , at 44. must take over some of the tasks of one the the great " pros " of political history , the 63-year-old Senator Taft . The Democrats were no less distressed than the Republicans . The minority side , from the Democratic leader , Senator Johnson , down , has found Mr. Taft in the five months of this Congress to be as fair as he is firm , with great respect for the right of dissent . There long has been a Senate saying that " things do n't go right when Bob is not here , " and men in both parties recalled it again and again in their private comments . Tile opinion of many observers was that , granted an improvement or no retrogression in health , Mr. Taft 's would still be the controlling voice , even in his temporary absences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eisenhower , could continue to count on Taft command of the Senate .
