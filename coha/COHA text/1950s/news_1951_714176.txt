txt Congress is about to approve about $7,500,000,000 in foreign aid , an over-all figure near the House-approved bill . The final form of the foreign aid bill , the result of compromises between Senate and House , follows Senate views in matters of administration . The program is to be directed by . a White House officer , but actually operated by the three departments involved  --  the Defense Department , the State Department , and a reconstituted ECA . Thus after nearly four weeks of conference between House and Senate committee members , final congressional action is just around the corner . What appears to have clinched the larger House figure was an urgent appeal received by the House-Senate committee from Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . It is understood that in reply to a cabled query from the committee as to his views , the general vigorously defended the concept of economic as well as military aid to Europe . The greatest Senate slash had been in that kind of assistance ? on the assumption that . what Europe now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Atlantic Treaty Organization supreme commander supported the administration 's ' views that economic help is really another , and very important , kind of military help . It contributes to Europe 's ability to produce military items , thus relieving the United States of need to furnish them . The prospect of an over-all aid figure of about $7,500,000,000 still leaves the program about $1,000 , - 000.000 under what the White House asked for . White House Director The Senate had reduced the figure by nearly $1,250,000,000 . The new administrative setup for this aid program still needs to be smoothed out , but is expected to wind up something as follows : A White House director of the program that will be responsible for coordinating all three types ( If aid programs  --  military , econor , technical .

It is expected that in its final form the agency directing economic aid will be a , reconstituted ECA . ECA itself was a congressional formed bureau assigned the job . of bringing economic recovery to Europe in a four-year period . As that time draws to a close , the thought is that it should be wound up as planned , but whatever further economic aid is necessary should be handled by a ' new agency. - Ike 's ' s/ Telegram Helps The balance of American aid this last year has shifted heavily from economic to military help , thug giving the Pentagon the control of and use of most of the funds .
