The reassuring thing about most grand opera is that nobody is ever left long in doubt as to who the villain is-or what he is after . A modern school of opera composition prefers another proposition : nobody is sure of anything . The plots of this school usually have the random malevolence of nightmares ; the singing line often gets lost among the soliloquies . Such an opera made its U.S. debut last week in Manhattan 's City Center : The Trial , by Viennese Composer Gottfried von Einem , based on Franz Kafka 's famed nightmare of the same name. * <P> The Trial had already had its world premiere at Salzburg ( TIME , Aug. 31 ) , and its plot was familiar to a good many in City Center 's advance-guard audience . A bank manager ( known only as Joseph K. ) is unaccountably arrested one morning ; from then on he whirls ineffectually from one cold hope to another , never knowing what he is accused of or who his accusers are , until , at the end . he is marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . <P> In City Opera 's moody production , each scene was hemmed in by high , grey walls broken only by gaping black windows . The action took place on a succession of movable scaffoldings , arranged to suggest a shabby room , an artist 's studio , an office . <P> Von Einem 's score , for all its effective orchestration , had more barking sound effects than flowing music ; much of Joseph K. 's music was recitation on a single note . While The Trial went on , the audience sat intent and silent . But at the end the applause was thin . Most of it went to Tenor John Druary for his two hours of almost continuous singing in the difficult lead , and to Phyllis Curtin for her beautiful soprano and her coquetry in the parts of the opera 's three erotic women . <P> ' THE TRIAL ' PROVES JUST THAT , headlined the no-nonsense Daily News . Wrote Olin Downes of the Times : " A praiseworthy performance of an opera that . . . did not deserve it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same wind that unroofed the old Habsburg Empire : Kafka grew up in Habsburg Prague ; Alban Berg , who wrote the gloomy Wozzeck , was a Viennese ; Bela Bartok , whose Bluebeard 's Castle almost makes a sympathetic character out of Bluebeard , was a Hungarian ; even Luigi Dallapiccola , whose opera , The Prisoner ( TIME , May 29 , 1950 ) , gives him front rank in the new school , grew up in Austrian Istria.
