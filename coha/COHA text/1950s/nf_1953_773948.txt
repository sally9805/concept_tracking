txt THE ENGLISH HOUSEWIFE Servants ' bedrooms , needless to say , were far from luxurious and generally held a bare minimum of very simple furniture . Nevertheless , some attempt was usually made to render them reasonably comfortable . Lady Hobart could promise maids " very good Lodgings to their Selfs " , with room to keep trunks by them , l and John Evelyn particularly noticed amongst the amenities of Althorp the neat and clean apartments set aside for the staff.2 On the other hand , Sir John Verney 's footboy lay " in a hole within the passage over the scullery " .3 Probably much depended on the space available , for in an age when many servants were kept , it can not always have been easy to house them all adequately . Maids slept in the attics as a rule , and grooms and footmen in a separate bothy or over the stables . Rooms and even beds were shared by two or three , but this was not then regarded as a hardship ; and if the bed in question were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pegs , and made up with rather lumpy flock mattresses and coarse sheets , they were still in all proba-bility much more comfortable than anything to which the ordinary maids or lower servants had been accustomed in their own humble homes . One modern convenience was lacking in the average house , not because it was unknown at this time but because the ordinary householder did not consider it necessary . This was the bathroom . Very advanced persons might have such a thing , but only if they were rich enough to spend money upon quite needless luxuries . Thomas Povy had one in that house in Lincoln 's Inn Fields which so impressed Pepys when he dined there in 1664 . Obviously Povy was a man who believed in having the best of everything , and , for his contemporaries , his bathroom was not the least considerable of his many fine possessions . Pepys gives us a glowing description of the house . " In a word , " he writes , following up this opening , as most people do , with many words , // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the springs rising up with the perspective in the little closett ; his room floored above with woods of several colours , like but above the best cabinet work I ever saw ; his grotto and vault , with his bottles of wine , and a well therein to keep them cool ; his furniture of all sorts ; his bath at the top of the house , good pictures , and his manner of eating and drinking ; do surpass all that ever I did see of one man in all my life . " 1 He does not tell us what the bathroom was like . Celia Fiennes was more explicit in her account of Chatsworth , which she visited in 1697 . There the bathroom was magnificent indeed , worthy of the most exotic imaginings of a modern film magnate . It had , she tells us , walls of blue and white marble , " the pavements mix 'd , one stone white another black , another of the red rance marble ; the bath is one entire marble all white finely veined with blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outside and you went down steps into the bath big enough for two people ; at the upper end are two Cocks to let in one hot the other cold water to attemper it as persons please ; the windows are all private2 glass . " 3 But such glories were rare indeed , and even at Chatsworth it is possible that they were more often admired than used . Ordinary people , if they took a bath at all , contented them-selves with a wooden tub before the fire in the bedroom . Even this was not brought out without some thought and prepara tion , and for everyday purposes the ewer and basin sufficed . No one then dreamt of anything so revolutionary as a daily bath , and if such a notion had ever entered anybody 's head , it would have been condemned at once as foolish , finicky , and dangerous to health . Some towns had public baths where cleanliness could be achieved without the trouble of carrying water up and down THE ENGLISH HOUSEWIFE stairs at home . Pepys tells us how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bathe herself , after her long being within doors in the dirt , so that she now pretends to a resolu-tion of being hereafter very clean " . In this resolution he evi-dently had little faith , for he adds , " How long it will hold I can guess . " T Nevertheless Mrs. Pepys did try to persevere in well-doing , and even to guide her husband along the same good path . Four days later there is another entry in the diary which runs : " . . . at night late home , and to clean myself with warm water ; my wife will have me , because she do herself-1 " z As for the privy , it was tucked away in a cellar or in a corner of the leads . It was unusual for even a large house to have more than one , and in smaller dwellings it was frequently absent altogether . It is a curious fact that the seventeenth century , so advanced in many ways , lagged far behind the Middle Ages in this matter . In the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with garde-robes . Often there was one on each floor ; at South Wingfield Manor , built in the early fifteenth century , there were two in each storey of that west wing where Mary Queen of Scots was im-prisoned in Elizabeth 's reign . They had shoots projecting from the outer walls , and as a rule they were carefully placed at some distance from the main rooms , in a turret or wall-projec-tion , and sometimes in separate towers . But by Stuart times these conveniences had disappeared , and only the richer house-holders possessed a solitary and not very sanitary " house of office " in some secluded corner of their establishments . Where such a room did not exist , its place was somewhat inadequately taken by commodes , known as close-stools , and chamber-pots . Commodes appeared in the best bedrooms ; earthenware vessels were kept in the other sleeping-chambers and occasionally concealed against a sudden emergency in some convenient nook downstairs . They were apparently very cheap , for when Sarah Fell in 1677 bought " 3 chamber-potts , an earthen dish and a stue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // for the whole consignment ) - Some were rather more ornamental than others , but ornate or simple , they were emptied with a fine disregard for sanitary considerations in whatever spot seemed handiest at the time . In towns the most favoured place was usually the street . In excuse for these careless habits , it must be remembered that drainage and cess-pools did not come into use until the following century . Even privies had no regular outfall , and for a hurried maid with a slop-pail an open window provided an obvious and rarely resisted temptation . Outside the house , of course , there were no public con veniences , but this was less embarrassing to our forthright ancestors than it would be to us now . Sudden needs had to be attended to wherever they arose , and no one then thought any the worse of their companions because of it . " My wife was ill , " wrote Pepys on a day when he had taken her to the theatre , " and so I was forced to go out of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a corner she did her business , and was by and by well , and so into the house again . " 2 Yet at this period the water-closet had already been invented . Sir John Harington had designed and built one at his house near Bath as early as 1594 , and described it in some detail in his book , The Metamorphoses of Ajax . His godmother , Queen Elizabeth , had one at Richmond Palace , and in Queen Anne 's reign Celia Fiennes saw at Windsor Castle " a closet that leads to a little place with a seat of easement of marble with sluices of water to wash all down . " 3 But Queens may perhaps be expected to be in advance of their subjects , 4 and certainly it was to be many years before such arrangements were included amongst the " usual offices " of the ordinary citizen 's house . // The Pleasures of the Table T HE provision of a generous table was one of the seven teenth-century housewife 's principal duties , and as a rule she fulfilled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of it , and in that age of flourishing agriculture , bird-haunted marshes , and well-stocked rabbit-warrens , all but the very poor were able to have it . Even the humblest workers , if they lived in the country , did not do so badly . The poorer townspeople suffered severely whenever prices rose , and towns-man and countryman alike felt the pinch when a bad season brought poor harvests . But the latter normally fed well and , in many respects , lived far better than his contemporaries on the Continent . " There is no Country in the World where the Inferior Rank of Men are better cloth 'd , and fed , and more at their ease than in this Kingdom , " wrote Charles Davenant in 1698,1 and what was true of the end of the century was also true of its beginning . The poorer English countryman had his difficulties , then as always , but he did not as a rule lack a sufficiency of good and wholesome food . Soups and thick broths formed a large part of his diet , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their own cow and a few hens to supply milk and eggs ; some kept bees or a pig , and there was usually a small garden in which vege tables and salad herbs could be grown . Variety was added by a little quiet sport which , though actually illegal in some cases , was not very seriously regarded by the magistrates . Much land was being , and had already been enclosed at this time , but there were still vast tracts of open heath and moorland and great undrained fens which teemed with rabbits , hares , fish and // game . Amid so much richness , no one minded very much if the poor man shared in the spoils , and if the game-laws were not too flagrantly broken , lie was usually left undisturbed . It was not until 1671 that the much stricter Game Act of that year definitely deprived the cottager alike of his sport and the food that it brought him , and turned an honest courser or fowler into a secret poacher . Before that , there was often an odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild-fowl , snared or stalked , and fish from a nearby river . Farmers and country gentlemen fared royally with home-bred meat and poultry , rabbits from coney-warrens leased or owned , fruit and vegetables grown in their own gardens , and bread , ale and cider made in their own bakeries and brew-houses . " They lay out seldom any money for any provision , " wrote William Webb of the Cheshire farmers in 1656 , " but have it of their own , as Beef , Mutton , Veal , Pork , Capons , Hens , Wild Fowl or Fish . " l If occasionally they did buy food , it was often at prices that now seem wonderfully low , even allowing for the greater value of money in those days . The shocking state of the roads made it difficult to send perishable goods to other districts , and consequently local products could usually be very cheaply bought . Along the coasts oysters and lobsters could be had for a song , in country villages the surplus cream , eggs , and butter cost very little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter in 1678 ; five years before , when prices were slightly higher , she had paid 81d. for three-and-a-half pounds . Three neats ' tongues cost her ninepence in 1673 , four capons and a chicken 2s. 2d.2 These , of course , were country prices , paid by a thrifty house-wife who was probably not ashamed to bargain ; in London a single chicken might cost as much as is. 4d. or even more , and a goose 3s . When John Verney married in 168o , he paid 8s. for the " 4 fatt Chikens " eaten by his seven guests at the wed-ding dinner , and 5s. 6d. for " a dish of Chereys " , 3 but then this // feast was not held in his country home at Claydon , but at " the Rummer in Queen Street , London " , where town prices prevailed . When so much was produced at home and the rest was so cheap , even the most economical housewife could afford to be lavish , and many a yeoman-farmer or small squire sat down daily to a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the necessary ingredients were available . Most of their eating was concentrated on the two main meals of the day , dinner and supper . Luncheon was not necessary when dinner was eaten early , and it did not become fashionable until many years later , when the dinner-hour had advanced to five or six o'clock . Afternoon tea , of course , was unknown in Stuart times , for tea itself was not introduced until about 165o and remained an expensive luxury for a long time afterwards . Breakfast seems to have been an uncertain meal which was eaten in some houses and not in others . In many families no regular morning meal was provided . Children were usually given something to eat before they began the day 's lessons , but for the rest of the family a manchet of bread and a little ale or cider was enough . William Harrison tells us that breakfast had once been a usual meal , but that when he wrote in 1577 it had gone out of fashion , except for " here and there some young hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , Fynes Moryson remarked on the same morning abstinence . " Those that journey , " he wrote , " and some sickly men staying at home may perhaps take a small breakfast , yet in general the English eat but two meals ( of dinner and supper ) each day . " 2 Nevertheless , contemporary diaries and household ordi nances show that this was not an invariable rule . Probably it depended upon personal idiosyncrasy , and the number of " young hungry stomachs " in the house . Cold meat , fish , or cheese , washed down by beer , was sometimes served at six or seven o'clock in the morning , and occasionally we hear of // more elaborate repasts at a later hour . Samuel Pepys gave a New Year 's Day breakfast to five guests in 1661 , and fed them on oysters , neats ' tongues and anchovies , with wine and North-downe ale . " We were very merry , " he says , " until about eleven o'clock , and then they went away . " 1 Towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or chocolate , was often taken at nine or ten o'clock . This habit , however , was mainly confined to the more fashionable townspeople . In any case such light refreshment scarcely ranked as breakfast , as we understand the term , for those who partook of it had often been up for several hours and had doubtless finished a variety of tasks before they stopped for what was really a sort of mid-morning lunch . Dinner was eaten about noon in the earlier part of the century and gradually became later until , in Queen Anne 's reign , two o'clock was the more usual hour . Such changes of fashion affected only the gentry and the richer merchants ; simpler folk clung to their noon-day dinner and ate it with their servants and farm-hands as their ancestors had done before them . But whenever it was served , it was always the main meal of the day , with as much generous and varied food as the means of the family would allow . Supper was altogether lighter , even in wealthy households . In farmhouses and cottages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or milk boiled with raisins , with ale or perhaps with mead in which apples were sometimes roasted . Elsewhere cold meats of various kinds , a little fish , rabbits , or a pigeon pie were usual , and these , with their accompanying wine or ale , were served at whatever hour between six o'clock and nine best suited the individual family . Tables were spread at meal-times with a white damask or plain linen cloth and set with pieces of silver or fine pewter which served as ornaments . In most houses the dishes and plates were made of pewter . Even the smallest farmers usually had five or six pieces of this much-admired metal , though they continued to use wooden trenchers for everyday meals , as their // forefathers had commonly done . Middle-class people had pewter salt-cellars and drank from pewter mugs ; the poorer citizens used wooden drinking vessels , or tumblers of coarse English glass . In a great house there were often large quantities of silver and silver-gilt plate with which the owners made a magni ficent display when they entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing-cups , bowls , and salts , and the fortunate guests ate off silver plates and drank from silver tankards and vessels of fine Venetian glass . The table was so laden with a multiplicity of dishes that the cloth could scarcely be seen and everything was on the most lavish scale except the cutlery . Of this only a minimum was provided , and in some houses guests were expected to bring their own spoons . Normally a single knife and spoon was set in each place ; there was also a napkin for every diner , and this was the more necessary since , in all but the most fashionable households , there were no forks . These useful implements had been introduced from Italy in the previous century , but they did not become generally popular until well towards the end of William III 's reign . During most of the Stuart period they were regarded as a mark of fashion rather than as a necessity , and simple folk dismissed them as a piece of foreign fiddle-faddle . Fastidious persons might toy with such outlandish tools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need no little forks to make hay with our mouths , to throw our food into them , " wrote Nicholas Breton with fine scorn in 1618,1 and this view pre vailed for a long time in all but the highest circles . Fingers were dipped into a large basin of water after meat and wiped on napkins , and with these concessions to the ideal of clean liness and good manners , the average person was quite content . Table-manners , indeed , were rather rough and ready during most of the Stuart period . Accepted conventions were rigidly observed , but within their limits surprising freedoms were , // permitted , or at least tolerated . In Charles II 's reign new rules of etiquette were introduced , copied mainly from the French fashions which prevailed at the Court of Louis XIV . Hitherto unheard-of refinements were adopted by the English Court and the circles nearest to it , both at table and elsewliere . These exotic customs were not very popular at first with the simpler country gentry who preferred the uninhibited customs of their ancestors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they gradually gained ground and , in the end , resulted in a great and very necessary improvement in general manners . In noble households meals were served with great ceremony , especially when guests were present . Seating was governed by elaborate rules of precedence which were never broken ; it was not yet the custom to seat men and women alternately , but every diner had his or her allocated place according to rank // and degree . Men wore their hats at table and removed them politely when they proposed a toast . " Mr. Moore showed us the French manner , when a health is drunk , " wrote Pepys in 1663 , " to bow to him that drunk to you , and then apply your-self to him whose lady 's health is drunk , and then to the person that you drink to , which I never knew before ; but it seems it is now the fashion . " i In that hard-drinking age , toasts were a popular form of civility . The host at a great feast often walked from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saluting each of his guests in turn ; and it was expected that gentlemen should honour every toast in frill , not with a mere sip , but with a glass or tankard drained to the bottom in one draught . Yet the man who drank a lady 's health with a fine flourish was not ashamed to get drunk in public , and if he did so , no one thought much the worse of him for it . Sometimes disputes broke out at convivial gatherings , and the hard words then exchanged often resulted in a duel . Sir John Reresby quarrelled openly with a fellow-guest in 166o and recorded the fact after-wards in his Memoirs with complete complacency . " We should have fought the next day , " he tells us , " but considering better of it , he submitted ? though it was he who received the affront , for I threw a glass of wine in his face . " 2 Nor was it only the wine which was responsible for what we should now consider extremely bad table-manners . Diners offered each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sat back to gnaw their bones and toss them afterwards to the dogs . Greasy fingers were dipped into a common bowl of water handed round by the servants ; and even those politer individuals who used a fork sometimes thrust it into the general dish , or employed it to free their teeth from any uncomfortable stray morsel that had lodged there . Even towards the end of the century , the writers of books on eti quette evidently found it necessary to point out that fingers should not be wiped on tablecloths , and food , once bitten , should not be dipped into the general salt-cellar . Soup , they // said , must not be too audibly eaten nor blown upon to cool it ; and coming down to the very elements of their subject , they besought their readers with justifiable fervour never to belch , hawk , spit or scratch their heads at table . Meals were divided into courses which contained as many dishes as possible , all piled upon the table together without any attempt to keep them hot . Two was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests were entertained . Pepys gave a dinner in 1663 at which there were oysters , then a first course consisting of " a hash of rabbits and lamb and a rare chine of beef " , and a second of roast chickens and a tart , with fruit and cheese . ' Three months later he gave an even better entertainment to celebrate his successful " cutting for the stone " . " We had fricassee of rabbits " ( he tells us ) , " and chickens , a leg of mutton boiled , three carps in a dish , a great dish of a side of lamb , a dish of roasted pigeons , a dish of four lobsters , three tarts , a lamprey pie , a most rare pie , a dish of anchovies , good wine of several sorts , and all things mighty noble , and to my great content . " 2 All this plenty was " most neatly dressed by our own only maid and cost a great deal " ; since Pepys , being a townsman , had to buy everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cost me near k5 , " he remarks of the January dinner . He does not say what he spent on the April entertainment ; perhaps he avoided thinking about it when he entered that day 's doings in his diary . But these were gastronomical high-days : there were other occasions when Mrs. Pepys ' rather erratic housekeeping provided nothing better than a dish of stewed eels , cold meat , or a rather unappetising mess of pease porridge . In the country where , as Gervase Markham wrote , the housewife " must proceed more from the provision of her own yard than the furniture of the markets " , 3 there was nearly always enough and to spare . An enormous quantity of meat // was eaten , roasted , boiled , stewed , or made into elaborate pies which contained a great variety of ingredients , and must have called for much patience and artistry on the part of the cook . In The Queen 's Closet Opened , a very popular cookery-book published in 1655 , there is a receipt which instructs the house-wife to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well boiled , blanched and cut into small Pieces ; also six Lamb-stones , as many good Veal Sweet-breads cut in halves and par-boiled ; twenty Cockscombs boiled and blanched , the Bottoms of four Artichokes , a pint of Oysters parboiled and bearded , and the Marrow of three Bones ; seasoning all with Mace , Nut-meg and Salt : Afterwards lay your Meat in a Coffin of fine Paste propor-tionable to the quantity thereof ; put half a Pound of Butter upon it , and a little Water into the Pie before it be set in the Oven : Let it stand in the Oven an hour and a half ; then having drawn it , pour out the Butter at the top of the Pie and put into it a leer of Gravy , Butter and Lemons , and serve it up . " ' Such a dish might be supposed to satisfy anybody 's appetite without additions , but on grand occasions it would be only one of a number served in a course . Chickens , ducks , and geese were largely eaten , with pigeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much prized . By rights it should have been the monopoly of those who owned deer-parks , but haunches of venison were often given by the gentry to their tenants , and there was a good deal of quiet poaching also . The flavour was sometimes imitated by sauces and dressings . In Sarah Loveland 's household book we read of a sauce made of vinegar , small drink , salt , and a little turnsole in which beef and ram mutton were steeped , after which treatment " you may take ye first for red deer venison and ye latter for fallow , and a very good judgment shall not be able to say otherways than that it is it self perfect venison , both in taste and colour and ye maner of cuting " .2 // Almost every dish had its appropriate highly-flavoured sauce . Sarah Loveland added a fillip to her roast mutton with a sauce made of spearmint and sugar , or of broom-buds , french beans , clove-gilliflowers , or cucumbers . When she tired of these , she stewed anchovies in claret " and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauce was composed of sorrell , sugar , and scalded gooseberries , and for pork she used sage , currants , melted butter and verjuice , mixed all together with gravy and the brains of the pig . The printed cookery-books also contained many delightful suggestions . " For roasted pigeons or doves " the author of the work already mentioned recommended vine-leaves roasted with the birds , minced , and boiled with claret , gravy and butter ; and for fish of all kinds he had a delicious-sounding concoction of thyme , horse-radish , lemon-peel , egg-yolks , butter , white wine , anchovies and pepper which , when stirred over the fire till it was " as thick as Cream " and poured on very hot , must surely have made the dullest fish a feast for an epicure . ' Boiled meat puddings were also numerous . Many localities had their own special varieties for which they were renowned . Then , as now , country people ate suet dumplings and York-shire puddings with their meat , or before it , and in nearly every district there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liver puddings . Sarah Loveland 's receipt for the last-named conjures up a vision of rich winter meals and strong digestions all too unfamiliar in this gastronomically degenerate age . She first part-boiled her liver and beat it in a mortar ; then she added thick , sweet cream , eggs , breadcrumbs and beef suet ; and for flavouring she used dates , currants , spices , salt and sugar , the whole concoction being allowed to stand for a while and then boiled gently over a slow fire . Winter was rather a difficult time where meat was con cerned , for winter-feed for cattle was generally poor , and fresh meat was scarce . Until the value of turnips and other roots was recognised it was customary to slaughter large numbers of animals every autumn , and to preserve the flesh by pickling , // or powdering with dry salt . At the beginning of October a large house was stocked as for a siege . Beef and mutton were powdered , herrings were salted and dried , hams were rubbed with salt and saltpetre , pickled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked over a wood-fire . Throughout the summer vegetables had been pickled , flowers candied or made into conserves , and a variety of fruit- and flower-wines brewed and bottled . Thus prepared , the thrifty housewife could face the winter calmly , knowing that her store-house was well filled , and that she could normally hope to supple ment its contents during the months of scarcity with game shot by her menfolk , poultry and pigeons from her own yards and cotes , and fish caught in her own fish-ponds or some local river of which the rights were owned or leased by her husband . The summer , too , was not without its difficulties . In an age when refrigerators were unknown , much thought had to be given to keeping meat and fish fresh . In Deliglites for Ladies Sir Hugh Platt tells us that powdered beef could be kept " after it was sodden " for two or three months if it was wrapped in dry clothes and put into a tightly-closed cupboard . Of this , he said , he was " credibly informed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fish , too , could be kept for a long time if it was first fried in oil and then steeped in white wine vinegar , and a fresh salmon could be preserved " a whole month in his perfect state and delicacy " by putting it in " apt and close vessels in wine vinegar with a branch of Rosemary therein " .1 But in spite of these and similar precautions , accidents some-times happened , and in the towns especially , where bought meat was not as fresh as it might have been , illnesses caused by food-poisoning were unhappily far from rare . Fresh vegetables were not as highly prized in the seventeenth century as they are to-day . Roots , artichokes , beans , peas , onions , and cabbages were grown in most gardens , and occa sionally we hear of potatoes also , though these did not become generally popular until much later . That observant traveller , M. Misson , tells us that the English often ate their boiled beef // with " five or six Heaps of Cabbage , Carrots , Turnips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and salted and swimming in Butter " .1 But that was in William III 's reign , when vege tables were gaining ground as accompaniments to meat . In the earlier part of the century they were regarded as rather un wholesome in their green state , and were mainly used as the foundation of soups and broths , or for sauces . Salads , on the other hand , were often eaten , and sometimes contained the most fascinating ingredients , like borage , rose mary , violets , rue , broom-buds and cowslips . Evelyn in his Acetaria gives the most minute directions for their preparation . A " sallet " he says , should consist of " crude and fresh herbs to be eaten with some acetous juice , oil , salt , etc. , to give them a grateful gust and vehicle " . These herbs should be carefully chosen , cleaned and shaken in a cloth , and cut with a silver , not a steel , knife . In the resulting composition " all should fall into their places like the notes in music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He recommends the French and Italian custom of decorating salads with curious figures cut out of red beetroot , but adds a word of warning about garlic , which is " not for ladies ' palates nor those who court them " .2 Besides meat , fish , and poultry , the staple food of the day was bread , made at home in most households and from vary ing types of flour . The well-to-do ate wheaten bread , and sometimes " yeoman " bread , which was of wheaten flour with a little bran left in it . Maslin or messeldine flour was made from rye and wheat mixed together . It was more economical than wheat-flour , and was often preferred by farmers ' wives , who considered it both wholesome and satisfying . Puddings and loaves made from barley were eaten by country labourers , who rarely saw wheat-flour except at harvest-time and other high-days . In the south only the poor ate the dark rye-bread which had formerly been fairly common , but it was still used by small farmers in the North of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northerners and in Wales . // Tarts and puddings were made of the same varied flours , though wheat-flour was naturally the most favoured . M. Mis son , who thought rather poorly of our cooking as a whole , had nothing but praise for the English boiled pudding which , he declared , was " a Manna that hits the Palate of all Sorts of People " . ' And if we may judge by contemporary receipt-books , he was undoubtedly right . Sarah Loveland 's White Padding was a rich dish of suet , sugar , salt , cloves , pepper , currants , dates and oatmeal groats steeped for twelve hours in milk . To this concoction was added hot boiled cream , with the yolks of eight eggs for every pint of cream . Quaking Pudding needed for its making " a good pint of thick cream , io yolks of eggs , with 3 of ye whites " , rosewater , sugar and fine flour . All these ingredients were boiled very fast for half an hour and served with a sauce made of rosewater or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestor of our modern Christmas pudding was composed of neats ' - tongues , chickens , eggs , candied peel , raisins , sugar , and spices , and with this rather liquid mixture went mince pies , which also contained meat . Fruit tarts of various kinds were very popular , and became increasingly so as the price of sugar slowly fell from is. 6d. a pound at the beginning of the century to Sd. or 6d. a pound at its end . Leaches made of seethed cream , almonds , rosewater and ising glass were favourite sweet dishes , and so were Imbals , which were a kind of shortcake made from fine flour mixed with pulped fruit or almonds , rolled out very thinly , baked , and sometimes iced with sugar and rosewater . On ceremonial occasions there might be marchpane , gilded and flavoured with pistachio nuts , or sugar-plate moulded into elaborate shapes . This was a confection of double-refined sugar , starch , gum dragagant dissolved ui rosewater , and white of egg , all made into a stiff paste and put into carved wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavoured with flowers . In Delightes for Ladies there is a very charming recipe which bids the housewife 56 . ' . - // " Take Violets and heat them in a mortar with a little hard sugar , then put into it a sufficient quantity of Rosewater , then lay your gum in steep in the water , &; so work it into paste , and so will your paste be both of the colour of the violet , and of the smell of the violet . In like sort may you work with Marigolds , Cow-slips , Primroses , Bugloss or any other flower . " ' Cheeses of all sorts were eaten at the end of dinner , or at supper , which was a late meal very like its predecessor , but much simpler . There were also cakes in great variety , biscuits , and occasionally fresh fruit , though many people were a little nervous of the last , believing that it caused fevers . Misson declared that the English seldom ate it . " The Dessert , " he said , " they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fruit is only brought to the Tables of the Great , and of a small Number among them . " 2 This , however , seems to be one of those sweeping statements to which travellers are sometimes prone . Fresh fruit is frequently mentioned in the diaries and accounts of those who certainly did not rank as " the Great " , and large quantities were grown for sale , especially in the South of England , where the growing population of London provided a ready market for the farmer 's surplus . Apricots , cherries , currants , pears , plums , peaches , apples , gooseberries , raspberries , strawberries and quinces all flourished in country gardens and were enjoyed , raw , cooked , or pre-served , by country folk . In the towns high prices often put them beyond the reach of ordinary men except in the height of summer . We have seen that John Verney was charged 5s. 6d. for a dish of cherries in 168o , and on the same occasion he paid 6s. for " a dish of Strabreys " .3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the fruit season was only just beginning . Six pounds of cherries cost the Earl of Bedford only 1s. 3d. at Woburn in June , 1663,4 and fourteen years later , in the same THE ENGLISH HOUSEWIFE month , Sarah Fell paid 3d. for strawberries in Lancashire . ' The quantity she bought is not stated , but probably it was at least enough to provide a dishful for the family . There were also oranges , imported , or grown in private orangeries . These were considered a great luxury and often cost as much as is. each . Our forefathers ' drinks were as varied and plentiful as their food . In the country home-brewed ale or beer was the normal drink at most meals , including breakfast , and the provision of a sufficient supply was one of the housewife 's most important tasks . " Sufficient " in this case meant a good deal , for the daily consumption was heavy and hospitality was generous . Brew ing took place once a month in many households , and oftener if necessary , and every country bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firkins , tubs , vats , coolers , ladles and other necessities for this complicated operation . Townswomen generally had to rely upon public breweries for their supplies , for urban dwellings , tightly packed in narrow streets , often had no space for a brewhouse . There was , however , no difficulty in obtaining whatever the housewife could afford , for public brewers abounded , and immense quantities of ale and beer were annually sold . Of the two drinks , ale was the older in England . It varied in strength with the local water and methods of brewing ; the strongest and best was said to come from the northern counties , especially Yorkshire . Fancy varieties , too , were greatly liked . Buttered ale was a delectable concoction , warmed , and flavoured with cinnamon , sugar , and butter . There was also mum , brewed from wheat , juniper ale , flavoured with juniper berries , bay-leaves , coriander , and caraway seeds , and cock ale which was a mixture of ale and sack , in which a cock was steeped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . Beer did not become popular until the end of the fifteenth century , and was still regarded as a foreign drink by old-fashioned people in Stuart times . " Beer is a Dutch boorish Liquor , " wrote John Taylor in 1651 , " a thing not known in England , till of late days an Alien to our Nation , till such times // as Hops and Heresies came amongst us . " ' But in spite of such laments , it was widely enjoyed , and was considered by many to be more wholesome than the heavier native ale . The strong beers of those days were strong indeed , and liable to endanger the sobriety of all but the most hard-headed ; but there were several lighter varieties , including the small beer which chil-dren drank normally without any ill-effects . Country housewives made cider if they lived in an apple-growing district ; in the West of England it was the staple drink , and took the place of ale and beer . Perry was also popular , and so was mead made from fermented honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sage . Fruit and herb wines were very numerous . Sarah Loveland had receipts for betony , birch , cherry , cowslip , elder , gooseberry , quince and raspberry wines , and we read elsewhere of others made from damsons , wormwood , raisins , and roses . A very delicious drink , particularly on hot summer days , was a sylla-bub of wine or cider mixed with sugar , nutmeg and thick cream ; another was red hippocras , of which the ingredients were claret , brandy , sugar , spices , and sweet almonds . To these , when they had been infused for an hour in a vessel " cover 'd and close stopt " , new milk was added . White hip-pocras was - made in much the same way , except that white wine and lemons were used , and the infusion was sometimes scented with musk and amber.2 Imported wines were too expensive for the ordinary man 's daily use , but wealthier people drank them very freely , to-gether with brandy , Hollands gin , punch , and whisky . After the Restoration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much deplored by serious-minded people , who thought brandy a dangerous substitute for home-brewed ale , or wine . Certainly there was a good deal of drunkenness in all classes at this period but in excuse for our ancestors , it must be remem-bered that water was often very bad and not always easy to obtain . In some towns the river was the main source of supply , // and water from it was sold in leather-bags in the streets . Un-fortunately , most rivers were also receptacles for every sort of filth and rubbish that the citizens saw fit to throw into them , and we can hardly blame the householder if he preferred beer or wine to their contaminated waters . That he did so , and with enthusiasm , there is no doubt . " My Lord , " wrote Sir William Scroggs to Lord Hatton in 1673 , " you must not take it ill if I write of nothing but wine , for there is nothing I want more nor of which I can write better or more willingly . " 1 Many of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French , Spanish , Portu-guese , Italian and German wine were annually imported , much of it privately by country gentlemen and tavern-keepers , who bought direct from abroad in hogsheads and runlets , and bottled for themselves as required . Nearly all wines were thus drunk from the wood ; the true vintage wine was as yet un-known , and it was not until the end of the century that the custom of laying down began . To import privately suited the purses of careful gentlemen who could thus often buy more cheaply ; but that this method was not without its uncertainties is shown by another letter from Sir William Scroggs , once again addressed to Lord Hatton . The latter was then in Guernsey and had , apparently , failed to send some promised supplies . " Sir , " wrote the indig-nant Judge with great fury , " I am much wronged by you in preventing me from buying of wine at L6 a hogshead that must now cost me ? io , depending very foolishly on one that I ought to have known before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be your excuse ; but why wine could not as safely come as cider I understand not , unless there be articles for apples but not for grapes , or that the vigour of one would make it safe , but the cowardice of wine would turn it into vinegar . " And he adds , very nastily , in a postscript : " If hogsheads were as cheap as warrants , I had received them . " 2 6o THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE About the middle of the century , three new drinks appeared , one of which was to become a much-loved national beverage . Tea , coffee , and chocolate all came in about the same time , and rapidly became popular with fashionable people . Chocolate was at first preferred , with coffee , which was much cheaper , a good second . Both were sold in the coffee-houses which sprang up in London and elsewhere . One of the earliest of these was established in 1652 in Oxford , " at the Angel , in the parish of St. Peter in the East " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was by some who delighted in novelties , drank " ) . London followed Oxford 's example two years later with a house opened by a Turkish merchant in St. Michael 's Alley and thereafter such places multiplied so rapidly that by 1659 , according to Rugge 's Diurnal , " coffee , chocolate , and a kind of drink called tee " was sold in almost every street . It was probably from one of these houses that Pepys sent " for a cup of tee , ( a China drink ) of which I never drank before " 2 in 1660 , for Mrs. Pepys ' household allowance would scarcely stretch to such luxuries . The first consignment of tea to reach London sold for the colossal price of C3 1os. od. a pound . When Pepys drank it , it cost about L2 , and finally it fell to about 20S. or a little more at the end of the century . Even in the middle of the eighteenth century it was still very dear , the cheapest being about 125. and the best anything up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was made in the Chinese fashion , very weak and without milk . " The water , " says Sir Kenelme Digby , " is to remain upon it no longer than whiles you can say the Miserere Psalm very leisurely . " 3 Even well-to-do housewives served it very spar-ingly in shallow , handleless cups of delicate porcelain . Simple folk , of course , never drank it at all , and the middle-classes had to wait until well on in the following century before they too could enjoy tea , coffee and chocolate as everyday articles of their diet . 6i CHAPTER I Kitchen and Stillroom THE kitchen in which the hearty meals of the seventeenth century were prepared was something more than the room in which the cooking was done . It was the cheerful , bustling centre of a whole series of chambers ? pantry , larder , butlery , dairy , and other offices ? where the ceaseless work of feeding a large household was carried on , and the place where , in many houses , the servants spent most of their leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , well-lit and warm , with a wide , open hearth , a stone-flagged floor , and a good supply of the tools and utensils needed for the important tasks that went on in it . Very often it was backed by a " little kitchen " or scullery that opened out of it , and an " outshut " or two where goods not in daily use could be handily stored . In such a room the cook and her assistants toiled in the heat of a blazing wood fire amongst bubbling stew-pots and slowly-turning spits . Here the gardener brought his fruit , salad herbs and vegetables for soups , and the farm men brought their bottles to be filled from the leather " black jack " under the dresser ; and here too the first news of outside happenings was often retailed by pedlars and visiting journeymen , or by the village women who came in from time to time to give a hand when the work was heaviest . Yet important as it was in most houses , the kitchen was not to be found everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist at all as a separate apartment , and the cooking was done in the " house-place " where the main life of the family was lived . There the spits , andirons , pots and pans were kept by the principal ( and often the only ) hearth , and the food was brought direct from fire to table without any of those journeyings along passage or ceremonial serving-customs // that must so often have forced the wealthy to eat half-cold meat . Even where there was a kitchen , the roasting and boiling was sometimes done in the living-room of humble dwellings to save fuel . In Thomas Wilson 's vicarage , for instance , there were racks , spits and hooks in the hall , which suggests that Mrs. Wilson cooked there , in spite of the fact that she had another room for this purpose , in which she kept pots , kettles , a frying-pan and various other utensils.l Such primitive arrangements were , however , confined to simple households , and elsewhere it was customary to have a special room for cooking . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining-parlour , though now and then we hear of basement or semi-basement kitchens , usually in some great establishment whose fastidious owners disliked the smells and sounds inseparable from the preparation of // meals . " This house is new built of stone , " wrote Celia Fiennes of Coleshill , a Berkshire mansion designed in 165o , " most of ye offices are partly underground ? kitchen , Pantry , buttlery and good Cellars . " 1 But though this form of domestic planning was known in her time , it was not common , and it was not until the nineteenth century , when the rising cost of land made tall , narrow houses economically desirable , that the staff were relegated almost as a matter of course to underground burrows . Solid , plain furniture designed for utilitarian ends rather than for comfort was the rule . Cupboards and shelves for the neces-sary utensils lined the walls , and in most kitchens there was also a dresser . In the early part of the century this term was applied to a flat board or table fixed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it was cooked . Above this , but not at-tached to it , were shelves where the implements needed could be handily placed within reach . By Charles II 's time this board and its accompanying shelves had developed into a single piece of furniture , often extending from floor to ceiling , with a boarded back , drawers in its lower part , and shelves of graduated widths on which pewter and crockery could be dis-played . One or two bare scrubbed tables for working on stood about the room , and for seating there were backless forms and stools . Sometimes there was an oak settle near the hearth with a high wooden back and arms at either end , and occasionally we hear of rush or wickerwork chairs . Usually , however , these concessions to soft living were found only in houses where the kitchen served as a family sitting-room as well as a domestic workshop . If the servants had no separate hall for their meals , a dining-table was provided for them at one end of the room , with a fixed bench between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench on the other side . This table was usually furnished at meal-times with pewter plates and mugs , but not always ; in some households the old-fashioned wooden platters and trenchers were considered good enough . The former were round plates of thin wood ; the latter were square , and often // hollowed on both sides , a convenient arrangement which allowed the diner to eat his first course and then turn his plate upside down for the next without the bother of washing it between the courses . With these plates wooden spoons and horn mugs were often provided . It is hardly necessary to say that there were no forks on the servants ' table , and every individual brought his own knife , which he used for dozens of other purposes during the day , to cut his meat . In a wealthy household , of course , such simple ways did not obtain . The servants in such establishments had a hall of their own for eating in and a table laid with a cloth and pewter plates and vessels ; and probably they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table-ware with which not only their own ancestors but frequently those of their employers as well had once been completely satisfied . Seventeenth-century cooking was done on open hearths provided with fire-dogs to hold the burning logs and sometimes , though not always , with an iron fire-back to protect the wall from the effects of constant heat . Above the hearth was an iron bar from which hung a chain and hook for the soup-cauldrons and stewing-pots , and notched pieces of iron to support kettles and pans at different levels . In time these bars and holders developed into the chimney-crane , a device fixed to the fire-back and having a movable rod that could be swung out over the flames , but this convenience was not enjoyed by Stuart cooks . By the fireplace the tongs , bellows , shovels , fireforks and pokers were kept , together with trivets for standing pans in the hot ashes , grid-irons , toasting-irons and ( in houses where there was no separate bakehouse ) the long-handled , flatbladed peels with which newly-baked loaves were taken from the oven . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faggots and billets , or obtained by landowners from the windfalls and fellings of their own woods . Coal was too scarce and too expensive to be used in kitchens . Country squires who lived in a colliery district sent their own carts to the nearest pit for it , or fetched it from some intervening point to which it could // be shipped by sea or river . If they lived too far from such centres of supply , they usually had to do without it , for the cost of carriage over long distances was practically prohibitive . In 1664 the Earl of Bedford 's steward paid 17s. 6d. a chaldron for coal bought at St. Neots , but he had to pay an additional 1os. a chaldron ? more than half the price of the coal itself ? for its transport to Woburn Abbey , twenty-seven miles away.l Londoners were better served , for fleets of small boats regularly brought quantities of " sea-coal " from north-east England to the city . In normal times it was sold there at prices varying from 18s. to 20s. a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal-boats were frequently intercepted by the enemy , the cost rose very steeply to 30s. , 40s. , and even 8os . This , of course , was exceptional , but even at 1 or less , coal was more often used in the living-rooms than for cooking , except in those progressive households where the forefather of the en-closed kitchen-range had already appeared . The kitchen fire was rarely , if ever , allowed to go out . A huge log that might take weeks to burn through was placed at the back of the hearth , and in front of it smaller billets , constantly renewed , provided a cheerful blaze under the hang-ing pots . At night this was allowed to sink to a slow smoulder-ing , and was revived next morning by a little work with the bellows . Fire-dogs gave the necessary ventilation and pre-vented the wood from falling outwards on to the floor . These dogs varied in size and shape . In cottages they were usually simple horizontal bars of iron , bent down at the back to form a foot , and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loose strips of iron for holding pans sometimes connected a pair . In more prosperous establishments taller dogs were found , often with ornamental uprights of wrought iron ; some , known as posset-dogs , had cup-shaped tops into which mugs or small pans could be set to keep their contents hot . In course of time , these dogs and loose bars , united to the fire-back , blossomed into the dog-grate . Inventories taken to-wards the end of the century occasionally mention " a grate // for sea-coales " amongst the parlour furnishings . This was either an iron basket which stood in the ordinary fireplace and could be moved from room to room , or a dog-grate made of iron or , in better-class houses , of polished steel . Being compact and raised on feet above the ground , such grates were suitable for coal , but in their early days they were not always very satisfactory . The wide flues of old-fashioned hearths could not draw away the smoke properly , and since coal-smoke is far more unpleasant than that of wood , many people found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shields were introduced into the chimney-openings in the early eighteenth century that it became really popular , and even then it was confined to the living-rooms of well-to-do houses . Wood , or in the near neighbourhood of north-country mosses peat , continued to be used in most kitchens for many years thereafter . Besides the hearth there were often clay or brick ovens built into the wall . These were heated by faggots ; the wood was burnt inside and the ashes then raked out with a long-handled " slice " , rather like a spade in appearance , after which the bread or other food was put in to cook by the retained heat of the bricks . Such ovens were chiefly used for bread , cakes , pies and pastry , for the baked joints which we now erroneously call " roasts " were not then usual . Meat was boiled or stewed in great iron pots swung over the flames , or roasted before them on a spit . The latter was a slender iron bar , tapering to a point at one end and having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird was trussed on to the bar , or in some types , on to a pair of sharp prongs in the centre . For large joints or sucking-pigs a basket- or cradle-spit was often used . In this the meat was not pierced but enclosed in a kind of oval cage of thin bars , from which the main rod projected at either end . When in use the spit rested upon the fire-dogs , the taller varieties of which often had special movable hooks for it on their uprights , so that the bar could be moved up and down to the required height . Beneath was a trough to catch the dripping and juices with which the meat was constantly basted as it revolved . // The necessary work of turning was occasionally done by boys , known as turnspits , but in more progressive households a mechanical jack was used . This was an elaborate contrivance which turned the spit automatically by a system of weights and gears , or by a smoke-vane , the motive power of which was supplied by the rising heat and smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was attached to the spit by long chains or cords , a circular disc or a wheel at one end replacing the older , boy-turned handle . Jacks were invented towards the end of the sixteenth century , and were to be found in most well-equipped houses by the middle of the Stuart period . So common were they then that his ignorance of their working almost betrayed Charles II on one occasion during his flight from Worcester in 1651 . Travel-ling disguised as Jane Lane 's servant , he came to John Tomes ' house at Long Marston and was there sent to have his supper in the kitchen . One of the maids asked him to wind the jack for her , and was astonished to find that the supposed serving-man had not the faintest idea how to set about this everyday task . Suspicion might easily have been aroused , but the quick-witted King averted it by saying that he came from a very poor district where " we seldom have meat , and when we do , we rarely use a jack " .1 A well-found kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utensils . Pots and pans of varying sizes were needed for boiling and stewing . For bread-making there were kneading-troughs , moulding boards , peels , and slices ; for other forms of cookery there were numerous frying-pans , kettles , pestles and mortars , sieves and colanders , skimmers , ladles , troughs of different sorts , chopping-boards , knives , cleavers , bowls and , of course , many dishes . Chafing-dishes filled with burning charcoal were used both for cooking and for keeping food hot ; they were handy implements because they could be carried about easily , and were not infrequently used for burning perfumes to scent the house and purify the air . Skilletsthe forerunners of saucepanswere for sauces and // small made-up dishes ; they had short legs on which they stood among the embers and long handles , sometimes adorned with mottoes , whereby they could be safely withdrawn . Larger pots rested upon trivets or hung from chains , and there were also earthenware pipkins , girdles , bakestones and toasting-forks to enable the housewife to make the utmost use of her fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was possible to bake small cakes and loaves by turning clay pots over them and heaping hot ashes round and on top , or a pannet inverted on a trivet might be made to serve the same purpose . Another very important item was the salt-box . This was kept near the fire for the sake of dryness , and sometimes in a little tunnel or aperture specially made for it beside the chimney . Considerable quantities of salt were needed every year , both for everyday purposes , and for preserving meat against the winter . It came from the brine-wells of Cheshire , or from towns along the coast where the white salt trade flourished , and usually cost about 16s. a quarter . Mustard , which was appreciated both for its flavour and its health-giving qualities , was ground at home , and consequently a mustard-quern was a necessity , and so of course was the spice-box . In a small house the powdering-troughs and pickling-vats needed for preparing winter stores were kept in the kitchen ; in larger establishments , where such things were very numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy , along with the barrels and firkins for the ale , or the churns , pails , cheese-vats and other oddments used in butter- and cheese-making . And last but not least there were the miscellaneous small articles that every cook needed ready to her hand ? the dredgers , funnels , graters , spoons and rolling-pins , and the bundles of thick birch-twigs that were used as whisks . In such surroundings , and with these tools , the housewife and her maids spent many busy hours preparing the generous meals of every day , and the elaborate and delicate dishes that graced a special feast . Cookery then was far from being a mere matter of plain baked joints and boiled cabbage , or hasty // preparations flung together from the contents of tins . It was a fine art which every well-educated girl had to master before her early marriage , and thereafter to practise constantly , either in person or by directing her servants . The printed receiptbooks show how much she was expected to know before she could claim to be a really notable cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always attained , her own household books , so carefully filled with ill-spelt recipes learnt from her mother or collected from friends and neighbours , prove how great was her interest in culinary matters , and how infinite the trouble she was prepared to take . There were , for instance , nine separate ways of clarifying and boiling sugar , each of them needing much skill and patience , and the author of The Queen 's Closet Opened scarcely exaggerates when , in his directions for " the Feather 'd Boiling " , he refers , not to the cook but to " the Artist " . Yet even more than the kitchen , the stillroom was the housewife 's cherished kingdom and the scene of her greatest triumphs . " When our English House-wife , " says Gervase Markham , " . . . is able to adorn and beautify her table , with all the virtuous illustrations meet for her knowledge ; she shall then sort her mind to the understanding of other housewifely secrets , right profitable and meet for her use , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 1 Those " secrets " were many and various . They included not only the jams , marmalades , wines and pickles needed for the winter stores , but also the herbal lotions , salves , ointments and wounddrinks with which every well-run house was stocked , cordial electuaries , possets , vinegars , and complicated decoctions like acqua composita or the lotion known as Imperial water . In the quiet of her stillroom shut away from the bustle , noise and gossip that went on in the kitchen , the lady of the house worked and planned with her stills , alembics and glasses round her ; and here she prepared the scents and aromatic waters so much admired in her day , soaps for household and personal use , tooth-powders made from burnt rosemary and alum , and 1 Gervase Markham , op. cit. // the curious oils and decoctions used in perfumes and in medicines . Besides all these , there were cosmetics ? waters to clear the skin of freckles , pastes to ensure a good complexion , lotions for the hands , and gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frivolities were no doubt chiefly for the squire 's lady and the wealthier town-dweller but , according to Richard Surflet , they were not unknown to the simpler countrywoman . In The Country Ferme he gives a number of receipts for what he calls " fukes &; such things as are apt for the decking and painting of the body " . He opens his chapter primly with the remark that no farmer 's wife had , or should have , time to trouble with such matters personally ; but he advises her to learn how to prepare them , " not that she should make use of them herself , but that she may make some profit &; benefit by the sale thereof , unto great Lords and Ladies &; other persons that may attend to be curious and paint up themselves . " 1 Whether many English countrywomen did in fact embark upon this form of private trading we do not know , nor can we be certain that the " great Lords and Ladies " patronised them when they did . But since the desire for a rose-petal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly probable that some at least of Dr. Surflet 's " fukes " were made in farmhouses and used with as good effect as ever they were in the Manor . Many were enchanting concoctions of roses , myrtle , strawberries , lavender or rosemary . The Queen of Hungary 's Water , which restored health as well as beauty , was composed of thyme , sage , winter-savoury , sweet marjoram and rosemary distilled in spirits of wine . For honey of roses red rose-petals , rose juice and clarified honey were boiled together , strained , and applied to the skin , and bean-flower water , " which taketh away the spots of the face " , 2 was made of that most sweetsmelling blossom distilled with white wine . Wrinkles could be cured by a decoction of elder-flowers , irises , mallows and beanblossom , and for freckles ( which seem to have been much dis Richard Surflet , The Country Ferme , 1600. 2 Ibid. // liked , if we may judge by the number of receipts for curing them ) , there were waters of strawberries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elaborate preparations of this kind demanded much time and thought , for not only had they to be distilled and infused , but every flower or herb had to be gathered at exactly the right hour of day and in its proper stage of growth . " It is meet , " says Markham , " that our Housewife know that from the eight of the Kalends of the Month of April until the eight of the Kalends of July , all manner of herbs and leaves are in that time most in strength and of the greatest virtue to be used " ; 1 from July to October " the stalks , stems and hard branches of every herb and plant " had to be gathered , from October to April the roots . Sometimes the moon 's changes had to be considered as well as the season of the year . " Wash your face in the wane of the moon with a sponge morning and evening , " wrote Sir Hugh Platt in his remedy for freckles , " with the distilled water of Elder Leaves , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be distilled in May . This is of a traveller , who hath cured himself thereby . " 2 One fascinating water known as the English Spring Nosegay took weeks to prepare . It consisted of hyacinths , violets , wallflowers , jonquils and lilies of the valley , all picked as they came into full bloom and preserved in spirits of wine until the day when the last flower was put in and the whole lovely collection could be distilled into what must surely have been the queen of aromatic waters . Other lotions were less complicated and needed only materials ready to hand . Eggs , for instance , were plentiful in the country and asses ' milk was not too difficult to obtain . Together they could be distilled , with a little cinnamon , into a water that had the priceless quality of making " a woman look gay and fresh , as if she were but fifteen years old " .3 Tansy , too , flourished in the fields and was apparently well worth gathering , for we are told that " if maids will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine days , and wash their faces therewith , it will make them look very fair " . ' A milk-bath tinctured with ordinary garden herbs was recommended by Markham for clearing the skin and generally toning up the system . " Take Rosemary , Fetherfew , Orgaine , Pellitory of the wall , Fennell , Mallowes , Violet leaves and Nettles , " he says , " boil all these together , and when it is well sodden , put to it two or three gallons of milk , then let the party stand or sit in it an hour or two , the bath reaching up to the stomach , and when they come out , they must go to bed and sweat , and beware taking of cold . " 2 The herb-garden , the bee-hives , and the farmyard all con-tributed their quota of materials . Hair could be dyed gold with rhubarb infused in white wine , or with honey mixed with gum arabic ; it could be made to grow by combing it with hemp-water , and dyed red with radish and privet . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the fresh blood of a cock or pigeon , but if the sufferer shrank from this , the sap of a birch-tree tapped in March or April would do as well . A becoming pallor could be procured by the burnt and powdered jawbone of a pig laid on with poppy-oil . The simplest and , in the opinion of country girls , the best cosmetic was May-dew . This had to be gathered early on May-morn-ing , if possible from under an oak which , like the dew itself , had magical qualities . A linen cloth was laid on the grass until it was saturated , and then the dew was wrung out , bottled , and used as a face-wash , a cure for sore eyes or the gout , and some-times as an ingredient in flower- or fruit-preserves . Beauty-culture , however , was only a very minor item in stillroom work , notwithstanding its importance to the young and charming . What really mattered was the timely prepara-tion of conserves , syrups and candied conceits for the table , and of purges , cough-cures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing that strikes us when reading the receipts of those days is the practical use to which so many THE ENGLISH HOUSEWIFE things now regarded as purely ornamental were put . Mari-golds , cowslips , violets and gilliflowers were all preserved , candied , pickled , or used in salads , cordials and medicines . Cuckoo-flowers were eaten as a cress ; lavender and rosemary-flowers were beaten with sugar and potted down for eating , and so were peonies , which were considered good for the falling sickness . Violets , elderflowers and cowslips were made into vinegars , and an enchanting blue water " of the true sky colour " 1 was distilled from camomile blooms , and jasmine , orange-blossom , lilies and marjoram were made into lotions , scents , sauces or flavourings . Of all these flower-materials , roses were undoubtedly the favourite . An immense quantity must have been needed every year for the rosewater alone that was so freely used in cooking , and in the making of perfumes and sweet waters . We meet this fragrant fluid everywhere . Gloves were scented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes and sweetmeats . Folded linen was sprinkled with it , and Queen Henrietta Maria 's cook tells us that " twelve spoonfuls of right red rose-water " boiled with fine sugar in the embers would make a house smell like a garden , particularly if sweet cypress wood was first burnt on the fire " to take away the gross ayre " .2 The flower itself was pickled in white vinegar and sugar to bring a pleasant breath of summer to winter dining-rooms , or candied whole in syrup , with its petals delicately opened " one by one , with a fine smooth bodkin either of bone or wood " .3 The hips were made into tarts , the buds and petals into vinegars , conserves , powders for sweet-bags , or pomanders for use against infection . There was also another form of honey of roses , for eating , not for beauty , which was composed of red roses and honey boiled to a thick syrup ; but the cordial known as Rosa Solis was not of this company , being distilled from the little sundew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparations must have been , they were // not achieved without a good deal of hard work . The gathering alone must have taken a considerable time , and if roses or violets were used , the white of each petal had to be separately snipped off before infusion or distillation began . The writers of receipts had the most lavish ideas as to quantity . A pound or more of rose-buds were frequently demanded , or as many clipped and separated petals as would fill up a still . Mary Doggett 's scent-powder required " 4 pecks of Damask Rose leaves , a peck of dried sweet Marjorum , a pretty stick of Juniper shaved very thin " , 1 and a variety of other ingredients , powdered and loosely mixed together . After the vision thus called up of laborious gathering on a hot summer day , it is quite a relief to find that William Rabisha 's " excellent scent-water " only needed two handfuls of musk-roses and a little sugar , steeped together in water that was poured , without distillation , from " one vessel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent and taste of the flowers " .2 Perfumes of all sorts were much prized in the seventeenth century . Bought for high prices in London or economically made at home , they were generously used on the person , on clothes , and all through the house . Men as well as women scented their leather gloves with rose- or angelica-water and musk mixed with ambergris and oil of almonds . Finer fabrics were sprinkled with sweet waters to give them a delicate flower-fragrance , and little bags filled with perfumed powders were kept in chests , carried about in the day-time , or held to the nose at night to induce sleep . Rooms were scented with small cakes or pastilles burnt upon the fire or carried about in a chafing-dish , and sometimes roses , musk , frankincense and spices were mixed with gumdragagant dissolved in rosewater to make candles which not only gave off a pleasant odour when burning , but were also thought to act as antidotes to infections and " venoms " . It must be admitted that these varied perfumes were not always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitation and an absence of bathrooms lent them all too fre quently a severely practical value . Side by side with a genuine love of beautiful things and gracious living went an indifference to defects of sanitation and a carelessness in personal matters that would be decidedly startling if found amongst educated people to-day . Baths , as we have seen , were not often taken , and scent was frequently called upon to cover deficiencies that would have been better remedied by soap and water . Other inconveniences happily unusual now were not unusual then . That most honest of diarists , Samuel Pepys , records how after one of his famous little dinners he asked his wife to cut his hair , " and when she comes to all , she finds that I am lousy , having found in my head and body about twenty lice , little and big . " This , he adds , was " more than I have had , I believe , these twenty years " . Evidently the affliction was not altogether strange to him , and certainly he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable words , " and so with much content to bed . " 1 Such an attitude was more common than might be supposed , and his indifference is a measure of the tolerance with which matters of this kind were then regarded . Nor were personal habits the only ones that occasionally left something to be desired . Notions of public sanitation were vague beyond belief . In the country this did not , perhaps , matter very much , but in London or in the narrow , congested streets of smaller towns , the situation was rather different . Borough authorities did indeed attempt to keep their road-ways reasonably clean and healthy by passing by-laws and by employing scavengers or rakers to remove the worst of the dirt ; but the former had not the backing of public opinion and were therefore more often ignored than not , and the latter were not always efficient or even very conscientious in their work . In 1625 Dr. Francis Hering felt obliged to demand that dung-farmers be " tied to their stint of time in winter , and not suffered ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer long " .2 Forty years later he might have made the // KITCHEN AND STILLROOM same demand , and with as little hope of its fulfilment , for what was wanted was not so much a strengthening of municipal regulations as a change of heart amongst the generality of householders and shopkeepers . The trouble was that even those who were personally fastidious saw nothing wrong in emptying their garbage , or pumping the overflow of their privies , into the public street . Offal and filth of all sorts lay about in the open highway , and pedestrians had to pick their way gingerly amongst steaming , fly-encircled heaps of rubbish . Foul smells abounded in every thoroughfare , and though complaints were many , no one took any practical steps to abate the nuisance . Within doors , careful housewives purified the air of their rooms and passages , as we have seen , with scents of their own making ; but on a hot summer day in London , with the windows standing open , the chafing-dish and its burning rose-pastilles must surely have been carried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit to sit in . The country housewife did not suffer this inconvenience , nor was she hampered by the smoke that even in those days was beginning to combine with Thames mists to produce the famous " pea-soup " fogs of the capital . For these blessings she was doubtless thankful . Her own house could be kept clean and pleasant without more difficulties than hard work and careful management could overcome . And in general it was so kept . It is true that a few fleas were not considered out of the way , but when these pests became too numerous , they were firmly put down with pennyroyal and rue . Rats and mice were the business of the family cat ; if he was old and lazy they might multiply into a nuisance , but otherwise they were tolerantly viewed as one of the ordinary manifestations of nature . But where actual washing , scouring and polishing were concerned , the good Stuart housewife was as strict a mistress as any that came before or after her . She and her maids worked incessantly to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everyday she took pride in adding the lovelier products of the stillroom and the needle . Romantic writers have perhaps // dwelt a little too much upon the " rosemary and lavender " side of seventeenth-century life , and so have given a false picture of that rather rough age ; but if these pleasant herbs , and what they stand for , were not exactly the distinguishing marks of domestic existence then , they were nevertheless a real part of it , and as such have added a definite and recognisable tinge to its many coloured fabric . // In Sickness and in Health . . . EVERY competent Stuart woman was expected to have a sound knowledge of first aid , nursing , and the simpler remedies for everyday ailments and accidents . Young girls were trained before marriage to prepare herbal lotions , salves and ointments and to nurse the sick with efficiency and care . If , through some defect in her education , a bride happened to come uninstructed to her new home , circumstances soon forced her to learn , for such knowledge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolute necessity . Doctors were scarce and , for countrywomen , usually far away ; trained nurses , as we understand the term , did not exist . On a large estate the wife of some tenant might be called in to help in an emergency , but unless she was extremely capable she could hardly be left without some supervision . It was to the mistress of the house that everyone turned whenever an accident occurred at home or on the farm , when feverish symptoms appeared in nursery or kitchen , or someone was smitten with epilepsy or an ague . Not only was she expected to know what to do by way of immediate relief and later nursing but , with no chemists ' shops or rural clinics to help her , she had to produce from her own storeroom whatever cordials , medicines , purges , splints and bandages the occasion required . Qualified doctors mostly lived in London or the larger towns , and travelled on horseback or by coach to country manor-houses when they were needed . This often meant considerable delay at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profession charged high fees for their services , as indeed they were entitled to do , for they had what we should now call a " scarcity value " . Dr. Radcliffe is said to have earned L4,000 a year , and Sir Theodore // Mayerne , we are told , left L140,000 when he died in 1655 , a respectable sum in any period and then worth about four times what it is to-day . All these costs and delays made people think twice before calling in a physician unless the trouble was really serious , and even when it was , they sometimes turned to less orthodox practitioners for help . When Mr. Wakefield 's two children and some of his servants were smitten with influenza , then called " the new disease " in 1658 , he consulted a smith of Edmonton who evidently had some medical knowledge , or at least a healing gift , for he cured them all . " Some people would have scrupled to make use of his Physic , " wrote Mr. Wakefield when all was over , " he being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our town . But he having practised upon many others about us , before we made use of him , the success his Physic hath had in our Family , hath much increased his fame , and really I think not without desert ; for he gives you as rational an Account for what he doth , as any Physician that I ever yet met withal . What I write is not to derogate from the honour due to many Physicians of quality , but in the country , such can not spend any time with us ; and the trouble of sending so far to and again , besides oftentime the mis takes and miscarriages of things , forces us to do that which if we were in London , we should hardly venture upon . " 1 Even when a doctor was called in , the nursing fell upon the women of the household . It was impossible to send the patient away for more skilled treatment , for there was no place to which he could go . Hospitals existed , it is true , but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended for any but the poor and friendless , and no one who could find any relation , friend or servant to nurse him ever ventured within their gloomy doors . Those who did so were quite as likely to acquire some fresh disease as to be cured of the sickness they already had . There was no proper isolation of infectious cases . Smallpox patients were kept in separate wards , and plague patients were not admitted at all , being shut up in their 8o IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH .. . own houses , sent to a pest-house in districts where one existed , or to cabins specially built for them during an epidemic . Otherwise all ailments , infectious or not , were nursed in the general wards , and many a man must have caught , and perhaps died from , a fever which he would never have contracted had he stayed at home . The nurses in such institutions were ignorant and untrained , poorly-paid and grossly overworked . They were required to furnish certificates of respectability and sobriety , but real medical skill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they brought to their task common sense and devotion , that was a piece of good fortune for the patients , but it was not one upon which they could confidently rely . Moreover , it was difficult for the nurses to do good work , however wellintentioned they might be , for the conditions in which they laboured were appalling . The arrangement of the heavy wooden furniture made it practically impossible to keep the wards clean . Bed-linen was scarce , and the sanitary arrangements were primitive in the extreme . Antiseptics were , of course , unknown , and death from gangrene followed with shocking frequency upon operations which were in themselves quite successful . Against these difficulties doctors and nurses struggled gallantly in a confusion of germs , dirt , and suffering unrelieved by anxsthetics , but the patients who recovered probably had their own tough constitutions to thank quite as much as the treatment they received . Under these circumstances , it is not surprising that most people preferred to rely upon home nursing and the practical experience of their womenfolk . They could at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room scented with sweet herbs and , probably , hung with red curtains and valances . It was then believed that the colour red had healing and strengthening properties , especially in fevers , and patients were frequently dressed in red garments and had red hangings round their beds . They were not , as a rule , allowed any fresh air . A bright fire with rosemary or juniper burning on it , closed windows , and bed-curtains tightly drawn at night were con-81 - mu THE ENGLISH HOUSEWIFE sidered essential in a sickroom , and any alteration in these arrangements would have been regarded with horror . Thomas Sydenham , one of the greatest physicians of his day , believed that patients derived much harm from over-nursing , and that in most cases Nature should be allowed to do the work . He treated fever by dieting , cooling methods , and the use of Peruvian bark , and consumptive patients he drove out of close-shut , over-heated rooms into the open air and made them take exercise on horse-back . ' But he was well in advance of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the old familiar methods handed down to them by their fore-fathers . Nearly every housewife devoted a large part of her house-hold books to medical receipts gleaned from guests , travellers , and sometimes from the local wisewoman . Many of her most valued cures were little better than charms based upon ancient magical notions of " like to like " , or herbal prescriptions founded upon the doctrine of signatures , which taught that every herb was clearly marked with the sign of the disease it cured . " Though Sin and Sathan have plunged mankind into an Ocean of Infirmities , " wrote William Coles in 1656 , " Yet the mercy of God which is over all his works maketh the Grass to grow upon the Mountains and Herbs for the use of Men , and hath not only stamped upon them ( as upon every Man ) a distinct form , but also giveth them particular signatures , whereby a Man may read , even in legible Characters , the use of them . " 2 Thus snake-bites were treated with viper 's bugloss , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Seal was sup-posed to cure all wounds and breakages because of certain marks on the root traditionally said to have been made by the seal of that monarch . For jaundice a decoction of the inner bark of elder was used because the yellow bark was more likely than any other to cure the yellow disease . Another remedy for this complaint was to apply slit tenches ( the " doctor-fish " ) to the feet and round the 82 IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH .. . heart . This , says Aubrey , was " an approved receipt for the yellow jaundice . . . a matter of five applications will do the cure , if not too late " . It can not have been a very pleasant form of treatment , for we are told that " tenches will , after applica tion , stink in an hour " , but they had , nevertheless , to be left in position for twelve hours at a time , after which they were buried in the earth and fresh ones laid on . It can only have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backbones would be taken out , and that nurses were carefully directed to remove the head of the fish " because it will be uneasy on the patient " .1 Some cures were even more frankly magical . A cold marble stone on which the sun had never shone was applied to the stomach in cases of colic , a ring made from silver coins offered at the Communion service was used to cure the falling sickness , or epilepsy . In a notebook otherwise filled with sensible receipts Susanna Avery gravely recorded that ha ; morrhage could be checked by writing the word Veronica on the ball of the left thumb , a proceeding that " will in a very short time stop ye bleeding " .2 And , once more from Aubrey , that persevering collector of oddities , we learn that ague could be successfully treated by boiling an egg in " the morning urine of the sick party before it is cold " , and burying it in an ants ' nest . As it wasted , or was eaten by the ants , so would the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I had from Captain Hamdon who hath tried it several times with good success . The medicine is in Crollius and Mr. Robert Boyle quotes it . " 3 Nevertheless , though some trusted remedies were more superstitious than practical , there were others which showed a sound understanding of herbal medicine and the elementary needs of the human system . The mother of a long family and mistress of many servants could not afford to make too many mistakes , and every intelligent woman slowly acquired , if only by trial and error , a good deal of useful knowledge . In the // country she set aside a portion of her garden for medicinal herbs from which she supplied the varied brews and decoctions needed by the sick . " For salves , " said George Herbert , writing of the rural parson , " his wife seeks not the city , but prefers her garden or field before all outlandish gums , " 1 and the same was true of the cottage woman and the lady of the Manor . Exotics like Peruvian bark , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , to be bought , but borage , feverfew , betony , cowslips , violets , rosemary , rue and plantain could be , and were , grown at home . All these plants have a genuine medicinal value , and many of them are still used as cures in country districts to-day . Madonna lilies were cultivated for their leaves , which were laid upon gatherings and whitlows . Skin-diseases were treated with sorrel or celandine , wounds with plasters made from Royal fern or carpenter 's herb . The roots of comfrey , bruised and laid on a cut , stopped bleeding , and lovage-roots , chewed when fasting , averted infection . Powdered in wine , they also eased the distressing ailment known as " griping of the guts " . For coughs , colds , and chest-troubles generally there were decoctions of pennyroyal , ivy , mustard , horehound , daisies , or calamint . Mandrake or briony cured women 's ills and pro moted fertility , and violets , vervain , plantain and rosemary were used for a variety of diseases in official as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common enough to produce " proved " remedies make rather curious reading . " If it fall out , " says Surflet , " that a snake or any other serpent be crept into the farmer 's body or into the body of any of his servants lying asleep with their mouths open in the meadows , gardens or other places , there is nothing more sovereign to force the same again out of such a body than to take at the mouth with a funnel , the smoke of a perfume made of some old shoe sole , for the snake detesteth such stinking savours above all other things ... " 2 84 IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH .. . Such a mishap must surely have been extremely rare , but evidently it was not unknown , for Surflet tells us that the remedy he mentions is " a thing tried and approved " . For the accidental swallowing of a horse-leech in drinking-water , he advises a dose of fleas in strong vinegar , thus proving the truth of the maxim that all things ( even fleas ) have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a misfortune rather than a fault , and we hear of numerous ways to enable a man to drink as much as he liked without ill-effects . " If you would not be drunk , " wrote Gervase Markham , " take the powder of betony and colewort mixed together , eat it every morning fasting , as much as will lie upon a sixpence , and it will preserve a man from drunkenness . " 1 Sarah Loveland ap-parently found it necessary to copy this receipt into her house-hold book , though whether upon general principles or because her menfolk 's habits made it useful , we do not know . Dried and powdered ivy-berries dissolved in vinegar served the same purpose if taken before a drinking-bout , and John Goldsmith confidently states in his Almanac for 1678 that if a man ate the roasted lungs of a hog in the early morning , he would not be drunk that day , " how liberally soever he takes his drinks . " 2 Melancholy , hysteria , and a failing memory troubled our ancestors rather more often than one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marigolds first thing in the morning is recommended by Mrs. Woolley3 for depression of spirit , conserve of cowslips for loss of memory and pains in the head .

Sarah Loveland took languedebeef4 gathered in June or July and expressed the juice to quicken the wits , and for melancholy she distilled gilliflowers , pinks , rosemary , mari-golds , damask roses and spices in four pints of sack . The result- // ing decoction , if taken three times a week , " cheers ye spirits and enlightens ye heart . " Something to " cheer ye spirits " must often have been needed , for sickness and death were never very far away from Stuart homes . It was on the nursery that the shadows fell most darkly . Almost half the children born died in infancy , and those who survived the cradle were often carried off by small-pox or some other infectious disease while they were still young . " Harrison , my eldest son , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her Memoirs , " Richard , my third ; Henry , my fourth ; and Richard , my fifth , are all dead ; my second lies buried in the Protestant Church-yard in Paris , by the father of the Earl of Bristol ; my eldest daughter , Anne , lies buried in the Parish Church of Tankersley , in Yorkshire , where she died ; Elisabeth lies in the Chapel of the French Hospital at Madrid , where she died of a fever at ten days old ; my next daughter of her name lies buried in the Parish of Foot 's Cray in Kent . . . and my daughter Mary lies in my father 's vault in Hert ford , with my first son , Henry . " ' Appalling lists of this sort could have been compiled by other women also , though probably the graves would have been less widely scattered since Lady Fanshawe , being an Ambassador 's wife , was more travelled than most . Many wives cheerfully bore a child every year for ten , twelve or fifteen years , but few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time did little more than maintain the population against the constant ravages of consumption , smallpox and the plague . In the early years of the seventeenth century a new menace to healthy childhood appeared . " There is a disease of Infants , " wrote Dr. Fuller in 1649 , " ( and an Infant-disease having scarcely as yet gotten a proper name in Latin ) called the Rickets . Wherein the Head waxeth too great , whil'st the Legs and lower parts wane too Little . " 2 This sickness had been known long before in Germany and Holland , and now it , 86 IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH .. . spread through England with such rapidity that it came to be known on the Continent as the English Disease . Francis Glisson , who made a special study of it , gives a sad little picture of children who " do not shake and brandish their little Joints , and are not delighted like other children , with the agitation of their bodies , being pleased only with gentle usage and quiet rest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses of the rich than in those of the poor , and this , though Glisson does not suggest it , may perhaps have been due to the fact that , whereas the poor drank plenty of milk because it was cheap , the well-to-do despised it and fed their children on soups and bread as soon as they were weaned . Whatever the cause may have been , the disease itself was all too common . " The Crookedness of his Legs grieves my very Heart , " wrote Sir Ralph Verney in 1647 of his little son.2 In 1681 we hear from Sir Thomas Browne of another child who was " great-headed and but short-winded , which showeth that she is like to be rachitical , and , as they speak here , is set for the rickets " .3 The most usual remedies were abstention from fish and other " cold and moist " foods , decoctions of rhubarb and , in some districts , ravens ' livers . " A woman in the West hath happily healed many by cauterizing the Vein behind the Ear , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How proper the Remedy for the Malady I engage not . . . a certain Dr. Skatt acquired a great reputation for the cure of rickets , and to him Mun Verney was sent to be " straightened " . The unfortunate child was strapped into a corselet of iron and leather from which he was only released once a week in order that his shirt might be changed . When his father suggested that a bi-weekly change might be // better , he was told that , with 2,000 patients on his hands , the physician could not possibly spare time to give individual attention of this sort to each ; and indeed , Mun was rather fortunate , for some kept on their harness for a month together.1 Ague afflicted young and old alike in that age of poorly-drained fields , stagnant pools , and ill-kept roads abounding in great insect-breeding puddles . It was treated with a variety of concoctions and charms at home and by advanced doctors with Peruvian bark . That consumption was also rife is shown by the number of remedies prescribed for it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that fresh air was not included , except by a very few enlightened physicians like Dr. Sydenham . While he could still get about , the consumptive patient mixed freely with the other members of the household , using the same cups and plates as everyone else , and taking a variety of ordinary cough- and cold-cures to relieve his dis tresses . When the trouble was too far advanced to be mistaken , he was confined in hot , airless rooms , and dosed with harts-tongue , coltsfoot , comfrey , or pills made from tar and ele campane . A favourite cure for this deadly disease was a decoc tion of snails taken from their shells , pounded , and boiled in milk or rosewater . To this unpleasant mixture earth-worms cut into small pieces were sometimes added . The whole was sweetened with sugar and candied eryngo , and taken two or three times a day . Faith in this curious remedy persisted for a long time and apparently emigrated to America with the early settlers , for in 1929 some American social workers found it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even more drastic than in seventeenth-century England , for a live snail had to be swallowed every morning for nine days . The idea was that the slime healed the lungs . The local people asserted that several patients known to them had been com pletely cured in this way during recent years.2 Pounded snails made into a plaster and applied to " the place grieved " were 88 IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH .. . also used for gout , a remedy apparently shared by the Moroc-cans for Aubrey tells us that " the Morocco Ambassador came to see Mr. Ashmole 's rareities when Mr. Ashmole was ill of the gout . The Ambassador then told his medicine , which they much used in Africa " .1 In this case the slime may actually have relieved the pain a little , and faith would do the rest . Blood-letting was a popular treatment for a number of ills . In some households the surgeon came at stated intervals and bled those who required it , and sometimes those who would have been better without it , for there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the full-blooded and the heavy drinker it was perhaps useful , and many such had regular recourse to it as a precaution . For the less robust , however , it was a somewhat stringent cure , and in cases of real illness it frequently weakened the patient to a dangerous extent . " Yesterday morning , " wrote Lady Brilliana Harley to her husband in 1633 , " I sent for a surgeon at Bishops Castle , that let Mrs. Walcott blood , and he pricked my arm twice , but it would not bleed ; and I would not try the third time . " In spite of the high courage that was later to carry her trium-phantly through the siege of her home , Lady Brilliana was always very delicate and suffered repeated attacks of illness for which strengthening rather than weakening treatments would be prescribed to-day . Yet so strong was the belief in blood-letting that when her son heard she was unwell , he immediately wrote urging her to be bled ; and she replied that she , " being extremely troubled with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untoward circumstances from having the opera-tion " which I did desire and do still " .2 The same surgeon who performed this office also drew teeth upon occasion and prescribed lotions for the gums . Failing him , a barber would be sent for , and for poorer folk there were always wandering quacks who pulled teeth at fairs and alehouses . Sufferers from toothache dropped the juice of henbane , hog 's fennel , plantain , or sweet flag into their THE ENGLISH HOUSEWIFE mouths , or perhaps , in desperation , tried some magical cure , like scratching the gum with a new nail and driving the latter into an oak . " This , " says Aubrey , " did cure William Neal 's son , a very stout gentleman , when he was almost mad with the pain , and had a mind to have pistolled himself . " 1 When all such remedies failed , extraction was usually the next step . The rich and daring might occasion-ally have a tooth stopped with lead or even gold , but this form of treatment , though fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tooth once drawn could not be replaced . Artificial teeth made of bone or ivory fixed in the mouth with wires or , more unpleasantly , real teeth from other heads , came in during the following century , but they were not known in Stuart times . This , however , did not matter as much as it would to-day , for dental caries seems to have been much less common than it is now , and those who escaped scurvy usually retained most of their teeth until well on in old age . Of the many infectious fevers which ravaged the country , smallpox was probably the most virulent and the most uni versally dreaded . The plague was mainly a poor man 's scourge that flourished most vigorously in the narrow alleys and rat-ridden slums of towns . Though its deadly bacillus was naturally no respecter of person , the well-to-do could usually escape it by flying to the country during an epidemic and remaining there until the danger was past . Smallpox , on the other hand , struck everywhere and was as prevalent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in the sixteenth century , it was not very serious , being confined mainly to children and rarely causing death . By the middle of the following century , however , it had increased greatly in violence and had become so common that most people believed they were bound to take it at least once in their lives . Even Dr. Sydenham regarded it as something which almost everyone must expect to endure at some time or another . He considered it to be natural process caused by the efforts of the blood to throw off impurities , and ascribed its growing virulence less to its own nature than to , , 90 IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH .. . over-nursing and faulty treatment . It is true that towards the end of his life he altered his views somewhat , but he continued to believe that , had physicians and nurses been wiser , smallpox would have remained as mild an ailment as it had been in Tudor times.l Children took it more lightly than their elders as a rule , and for this reason they were sometimes deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might get it over in the period of least danger . Nevertheless , many died of it , and those who took it later in life stood in even greater peril . More than fifteen hundred people perished in London alone during the epidemic of 1659 . Doctors had plenty of experience in fighting it , but seemed unable to find an adequate cure , and the most devoted care and attention was often insufficient . Indeed , it was amongst the well-to-do that the mortality was highest , which in some degree supports Dr. Sydenham 's views on over-nursing . It may well be that for all their red hangings specially bought for the occasion , their well-warmed rooms and nourishing foods , the rich were less favourably placed than the poor who , through lack of means , were forced to give less attention to their patients and so allow Nature to take her own course . In 166o , the King lost a brother and sister within three months of each other . The Duke of Gloucester died in Sep tember . Mary of Orange , who came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection and died in forty-eight hours . Edward Hyde 's young wife was carried off with appalling rapidity during a journey to London after she had been married only six months . " She fell sick at Reading , and being removed to a Friend 's House near that Town , the small Pox declared themselves , and ( she being with Child ) forced her to miscarry ; she died within two Days . " 2 Had she lived , she would probably have been disfigured , like poor Dorothy Osborne who con tracted smallpox shortly before her wedding and lost her beauty through it . " We hope his visage will suffer little , " wrote William Blundell in 1681 of his young charge , Edmund , // " the doctor in that particular being said to be skilful and fortunate . " 1 Unhappily , many physicians of the time were not " fortunate " , and for women at least the dread of a face ruined by pock-marks must have added intolerably to the normal pains and terrors of the disease . In all feverish ailments much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decoctions of violets or wood-sorrel , and the roots of pestilence-wort2 powdered in wine . When the fever was at its height , pigeons cut in half were clapped to the feet , or if birds were not obtainable a bullock 's milt3 served the same purpose . Later on , when the patient was either dead or cured , the room was fumigated with pitch and frankincense , and sometimes with sulphur . Some attempt was usually made to keep the sufferer isolated from his fellows , but seventeenth-century notions of infection were somewhat vague , and the good advice of medical and civic authorities was often ignored . In the letter already quoted William Blundell writes : " It is now the 13th day and Edmund grows daily better . . . his hair is now cut off and herein I do purpose to send you an unclean small lock of the same . " 4 During outbreaks of the plague the London theatres were closed ; assemblies were prohibited , and the sale of possibly infected rags and clothing forbidden . In 1603 Dr. Lodge recom mended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rarely adopted by the rich and still less fre quently , for obvious reasons , by the poor.5 At Congleton a bad outbreak which began in 1641 and lasted for two years was started by a box of , presumably , flea-infested garments sent from a plague-centre , and the terrible epidemic at Eyam in 1665 , which destroyed 2S9 people out of a population of 300 , sprang from a similar beginning . 92 IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH .. . The horror which the plague inspired in all men 's minds was due almost as much to the general ignorance of its causes as to the virulence of the disease itself It struck suddenly and without warning , and no one knew why unless , as many thought , it was a sign of God 's anger . A man sickened and // died , and within a few days a dozen others lay dying , within a fortnight , hundreds . In some cases death came so rapidly that an individual apparently healthy one morning might be gone before the next . " Men went about prescribing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " till the tokens were upon them , and they dropped down dead , destroyed by the very enemy they directed others to oppose . " 1 Pepys tells us the hackney coach in which he was driving along Holborn sud denly stopped , and the terrified driver announced that he was " struck very sick , and almost blind , he could not see " . The diarist therefore alighted " and went into another coach , with a sad heart for the poor man and trouble for myself lest he should have been struck with the plague " .2 It did not occur to him to help the poor wretch , and indeed there was little he could have done . If it was indeed the plague the unfinished journey with Pepys was probably the coachman 's last in this world until the dead-cart carried him to an anonymous grave in one of the great plague-pits on the city 's edge . Yet all the while the visible peril was running and scurrying in men 's homes without their recognising it . Pneumonic plague , which attacked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient 's coughing , but the bubonic variety was caused mainly by the bites of fleas from infected rats . The filthy , ill-kept , wattle-and-daub cottages of ports and urban slums abounded in black rats , creatures which , unlike their more timid brown brothers , loved human dwell ings and bred there freely whenever the necessary conditions of dirt and disorder were present . Their fleas did not attack man while the rat lived , but they did so when their natural host was dead , and unfortunately they could live a long time without food . Concealed in clothes , rags , or bedding , fleas from a plague-stricken rat could thus infect human beings long after the animal itself had perished and , as at Congleton and Eyam , they could strike at a distance if the stuff was sent away . 94 IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH .. . These facts were not suspected by any one at the time . Some dim notion that the disease might be animal-borne prompted the wholesale killing of cats and dogs during an outbreak , but this only resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Robert Long , Auditor of the Exchequer , evidently dreaded anything that ran about freely , for on July 5th , 1655 , he wrote to his clerk : " I pray you use all possible care to preserve yourselves and my house . . . take all course you can against the rats , and take care of the cats ; the little ones that will not stir out may be kept , the great ones must be killed or sent away . " 1 It was more usual , however , to ascribe the plague to the influence of the planets , to the corruption of the air , or to certain inherent tendencies in individuals whose " bodies where there is a Cacochymia , corrupt and superfluous humours abounding , are apt and lightly infected . " 2 And be yond all these secondary causes , there was the wrath of God , against which no human remedies could prevail unless they were accompanied by prayer , fasting and repentance . Men sought to protect themselves by carrying pomanders and strewing their houses with rue and wormwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul air , and chewed lovage , gentian-roots , and pomecitron . Tobacco , chewed or smelt , was also used as an antidote . Pepys , walking in Drury Lane in 1665 , saw two or three houses marked with the dreaded red cross and the words " Lord have mercy upon us " . It was , he tells us , " a sad sight to me , being the first of the kind that , to my remembrance , I ever saw . It put me into an ill concep tion of myself and my smell , so that I was forced to buy some roll-tobacco to smell to and chaw , which took away the apprehension . " 3 Dr. Lodge recommended the wearing of an eastern hyacinth stone to quicken the vital spirits ; other physicians favoured bags of arsenic worn next to the skin , and amulets of all sorts // were very popular . " Get a piece of angel gold , " wrote John Allin , minister and physician , on September 22nd , 1665 , " if you can one of Eliz. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , and keep it always in your mouth when you walk out or any sick persons come to you ; you will find strange effects of it for good in freedom of breathing , etc. , as I have done . " 1 Onions peeled and left about the room were thought to attract the poison to themselves and thus save the inmates of the house . Draughts of Venice treacle , or of sack mixed with salad oil and gunpowder were taken internally . An unknown sub-stance reputed to be unicorn 's horn was widely sold as an antidote . A very odd remedy advised by James Manning in 1604 was to put two or three sheep into an infected room , leave them there for a time , and then wash them in warm water . This water was to be given to pigs to drink , and if the latter died , the house was then thought to be clear of the disease.2 In the last resort , however , the only safe way of escape was to fly from the stricken town . All who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places hitherto free from it . Ralph Dawson brought it to Malpas from London in 1625 and infected half the village , including his own parents , brother and sister , all of whom died , like Ralph himself . Hampton Court , Oatlands , and Windsor were all in turn contaminated when the Court moved there to escape the same epidemic . Thirty years later refugees from London brought the disease to Northamptonshire , Essex , East Anglia and Hampshire , and even as far afield as Dorset . " The sickness is at Chelmsford , a little mile from me , " wrote Mrs. Adams in 1665 , " which causes me to be very fearful , so many of our town that goes that way to Market " ; and in the following year her sister Cary reported that it was raging in Winchester and that " in South ampton , I think , have died almost 1,000 " .3 erny eors. 96 IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH .. . Those who from poverty or a sense of duty remained in a plague-centre lived in constant terror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses , and the relations of the sick struggled gallantly with the inadequate remedies at their disposal , achieving little good thereby . Dr. Nathanial Hodges treated his patients with bezoar stone , Virginian snake-root and dried toad-powder , and protected himself on his rounds by drinking electuaries , sucking lozenges of myrrh , cinnamon and angelica , and burning " some proper thing upon coals " on the threshold of each infected dwelling . l When the plague-sores appeared , poultices of onions and other plants were laid upon them , or a live chicken was applied to draw out the venom . The bird was left there till it choked and died , and the treat ment was repeated until some fowl managed to survive , after which the patient was expected to recover . The system of sealing up infected houses , with their healthy as well as their sick inhabitants , often turned a single case into something like a death-warrant for the entire family . Inside those shut and guarded doors , marked by the ominous red cross , devoted women laboured to heal their relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allowed to enter except some harassed and overworked physician and , later , the " searcher " who came to certify the cause of death . Now and then some terrified person as yet untainted , or a frenzied patient in the throes of delirium managed to escape and so spread the disease . Pepys records a grim story of a gallant who , seeing a coach with its curtains drawn and think ing it contained some coy lady , thrust his head between the curtains " and there saw somebody look very ill , and in a sick dress , and stunk mightily . . . which put this young gentleman into a fright that almost cost him his life . " 2 " We are afraid of all we meet , " wrote Mrs. Stewkeley after some sick people had broken out of their sealed houses in Hampshire , and well she might be , for there the patients , or more probably their relatives imprisoned with them , seem to have maliciously // forced themselves into the houses of the healthy . ' Pepys also tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vestry meeting . Complaint having been made against a man who had carried a child from an infected house out of London , " Alderman Hooker told us it was the child of a very able citizen of Gracious Street , a saddler , who had buried all the rest of his children of the plague , and himself and his wife being now shut up and in despair of escaping , did desire only to save the life of this little child ; and so prevailed to have it received stark-naked into the arms of a friend who brought it ( having put it into new fresh clothes ) to Greenwich ; where upon hearing the story we did agree it should be permitted to be received and kept in the town . " 2 As a rule , however , patients and their friends endured to the end behind their closed doors , or in cabins or pest-houses , while the Bills of Mortality grew longer every week , and the air was filled with the intolerable tolling of funeral bells . Those outside carried on with ordinary existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal business was at a stand-still. " . . . no boats upon the River , " wrote Pepys at the height of London 's most famous epidemic , " and grass grows all up and down White Hall court , and nobody but poor wretches in the street ! " 3 Yet , had he but known it , the final deliverance was not far off . The plague , which had haunted England in isolated cases and widespread epidemics since the time of the Black Death and destroyed many thousands of lives in Pepys ' own century , was even then a dying disease . The terrible out-breaks of 1665-6 in London and the provinces were the pest-demon 's last fling , 4 and thenceforward , except for a few late cases of slight importance , he was not seen again in England . // A Notable Housewife TO be a good wife and mother was the end for which every young girl in the seventeenth century was carefully trained from early childhood ; to be what was then known as " a notable housewife " was the cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not an ambition that was easy to attain , for it called for considerable gifts of character and wit , besides a wide knowledge of domestic matters . For a woman to be so described by her contemporaries meant that she was a home-maker in the truest and widest sense ? one who not only ran her house efficiently and well , but also beautified it materially by the work of her hands , and made it spiritually a place of peace and happiness for those who lived therein . " She must , " says Markham , " be of chaste thought , stout courage , patient , untired , watchful , diligent , witty , pleasant , constant in friendship , full of good Neighbour-hood , wise in Discourse but not frequent therein , sharp and quick of speech , but not bitter or talkative , secret in her affairs , com fortable in her counsels , and generally skilful in the worthy knowledges which do belong to her Vocation .
