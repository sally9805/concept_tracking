Since Korea , one goal of the rearmament program has been to build up a big enough supply of weapons to tide the U.S. over the first year of an all-out war . How big should that supply be ? In Washington last week , the Office of Defense Mobilization 's eight-man Advisory Committee on Production Equipment , headed by Stude-baker 's Chairman &; President Harold S. Vance , gave a startling answer : nobody seems to have the faintest idea . Furthermore , the military apparently has not taken into consideration the fact that some items could be brought into full production in a few months , while others might require a year or more . Pentagon estimates , said the committee , " call for greater quantities of military hard goods than the supplies of materials and the manpower and production capacity of the nation could possibly support . " <P> In making an overall survey of postKorea rearmament policy , the Vance committee talked some hard sense about the progress and shortfalls of the arms program . Now that military equipment is coming out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-examine the whole idea of building up stocks of weapons that may be obsolete by the time they are needed . The committee 's conclusion : the U.S. should stop its hand-to-mouth buying and " substitute , to the greatest extent practicable , production capacity for the stockpiling of military end-items . " Much progress has already been made in boosting weapons-making capacity ; now the job ought to be finished no matter what the cost . Among the committee 's recommendations : <P> By every means possible , e.g. , 100% fast amortization and more liberal ' treatment under the excess profits tax , the <P> U.S. should encourage private industry to build the new productive capacity needed . <P> If any new capacity is found to be " commercially nonsupportable , " the Government itself should build the needed tools and plants , at a possible cost of $1 billion to $2 billion . <P> The key to production is machine tools . <P> The Government should spend some $300 million a year to maintain its $6 billion inventory of machine tools , and another $200 million to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional plant space . <P> Such a plan , said the committee , would save money in the long run ; " In most military equipment programs , the initial cost of facilities is small compared to the cost of producing end-items for the stockpile . " Example : thousands of rocket-launching mounts would be needed in the first three years of all-out war - about twice what present plants could turn out in that period . " Yet , an expenditure equal to the cost of producing only 150 of these items . . . would provide . . . production equipment capable of meeting the maximum rate . " <P> In seven months of work , the Vance committee went from agency to agency in Washington , asking questions that often brought quick results . Why was the Army scheduling production of 20,000 M48 Patton tanks while its own estimates showed that there was a need for only 7,500 of them ? Lacking an answer , the Army cut its production schedule in half .                @ @ @ @ @
