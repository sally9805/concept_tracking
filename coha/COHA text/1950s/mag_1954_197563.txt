On the Election <P> The pro-Ike MADISON , Wis . STATE JOURNAL : The Republicans deserved to lose this one , not because their record was bad , but because they failed to tell the voters how good it actually was . The Republicans had a record of winning and maintaining the peace , cutting taxes , beginning the job of eradicating Communists and Communist influence from government . But the Republicans let the opposition call the signals . <P> Hearst 's pro-Eisenhower , pro-McCarthy NEW YORK JOURNAL-AMERICAN : There are three chief causes for the comparatively good showing of the Republicans : 1 ) The honest-to-goodness grass roots campaign by Vice President Dick Nixon . 2 ) The dramatic last-minute appeal by Senator Joseph McCarthy to Republicans to forget their differences . 3 ) The eleventh-hour realization by Republican campaigners that they were in a fight and not punting in the moonlight . <P> The pro-Ike , pro-Douglas CHICAGO DAILY SUN-TIMES : This election may also be a last-time warning to the Old Guard to either get in step with the 20th century , as represented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Nixons and the Knowlands have had their say and have been found wanting . <P> The Democratic ATLANTA CONSTITUTION : The Eisenhower crusade , which was shackled by Joe McCarthy , isolationists and the President 's lack of positive leadership , lost momentum . The professionals about the President never really believed in the crusade ; the amateurs who did were politically inept . <P> The pro-Ike PORTLAND OREGONIAN : The election was a crazy quilt stitched on personalities and local issues . The Democratic-Labor coalition hit the question of unemployment with everything it had , tied it up with administration indifference to tax relief for working people and " giveaway " of natural resources . The Eisenhower administration failed to put together a power program for the Northwest . <P> THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS : The Republicans did n't begin to put in their best licks till about three weeks ago , with President Eisenhower having to be prodded to roll up his sleeves . If he had slugged sooner , oftener and harder , his party would have kept and strengthened its control of Congress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Republican policy , rather than support of the Democrats , who did not hold out any concrete program . The returns showed that the American people do not approve the policy of fascism and aggression promoted by the U.S.A. 's leading circles . <P> London 's conservative DAILY TELEGRAPH : President Eisenhower is still a popular President . It seems likely it was his abiding prestige and personal intervention in the campaign that stopped the movement away from the Republican Party from becoming the landslide that was being freely predicted . <P> ROSCOE DRUMMOND , the Republican New York Herald Tribune 's chief Washington correspondent : The real " secret weapon " of the Republican campaign and the Republican winner of 1954 is Ezra Taft Benson , the flexible-price-support Secretary of Agriculture . The " farm revolt " just did n't develop . And Secretary Benson has shown himself to be , not the bogeyman , but the strong man of the Republican campaign , second only to the President himself . <P>                  @ @ @
