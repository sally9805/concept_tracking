" Dancing has a tendency to invigorate the spirit and promote health , " said the founder of Mormonism , Joseph Smith of Palmyra , N.Y . Last week at Salt Lake City 's University of Utah Stadium , 8,000 young Mormons in blue skirts and white blouses . Spanish costumes , tangerine and black jumpers or pastel formals romped and whirled through a two-night program of waltzes , fox trots , folk dances , tangos , rumbas and square and round dances and even some " toned-down " jitterbug steps . <P> It was the climax of an annual four-day festival . While other faiths may frown , the Mormons encourage dancing between couples lest the Devil find other work for them . Each of some 1,400 Mormon chapels holds a dance every Saturday night-including a floor show during intermission to undercut any inclination couples may feel to wander off by themselves . The result is that the Mormons are easily the dancingest denomination in the U.S. <P> Sponsor of the festival is the Mormon Young Men 's and Young Women 's Mutual Improvement Association , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young delivered to his numerous daughters after dinner on the night of Nov. 28 , 1869 : " Retrench , retrench in your dress , in your tables , in your speech . Retrench in everything that is bad and worthless , and improve in everything that is good and beautiful . " The Latter-day Saint Retrenchment Association , sparked that evening , eventually became M.I.A. , which now has a worldwide membership of 367,860 . Directors of activities contribute their services free , and often at considerable personal loss . One director traveled more than 5,000 miles in one year at his own expense to supervise the dance program in his district . <P> Explains Dance Director Rulon Stanfield , a Utah business engineer : " The glory which one attains in the next world is relative to the amount of his service to his fellow man on earth . And no matter how many dollars you sacrifice , you forget all about it when you see those young dancing feet . "                  @ @ @
