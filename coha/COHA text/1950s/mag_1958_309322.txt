The Pope 's Music <P> SIR : <P> THIS YEAR MY HUSBAND HAD THE GREAT HONOR TO CONDUCT A SPECIAL CONCERT IN THE VATICAN , OFFERED TO THE POPE BY THE ITALIAN RADIO-TV . THE POPE CHOSE THE MUSIC HE LOVED MOST , INCLUDING BEETHOVEN 'S FIRST SYMPHONY . HE REQUESTED TO HEAR THIS SYMPHONY JUST BEFORE HIS DEATH . <P> MRS . ARTUR RODZINSKI <P> LAKE PLACID , N.Y . <P> Two Sides of an Island <P> Sir : <P> I wish to express my complete agreement with the views on Quemoy and Matsu as expressed by Dulles and Nixon Oct. 6 . <P> It must be remembered that our State Department today is faced with the task of trying to put out the fire started by the ineptitude of two previous Administrations . Since 1945 , we and/or our friends and allies have been kicked out of China , Albania , Indo-China , North Korea , Tibet , Iraq , Hungary and Suez . Is Quemoy to be next on the list ? <P> EDGAR W. RIEBE <P> Metuchen , N.J <P> Sir : <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice President Nixon and his blatant opportunism , but they can not be fooled all the time-as testified by the " weight of the mail . " <P> IRENE TRIVAS <P> New York City <P> Sir : <P> Your Oct. 6 " A Stand on Principle " was most absurd . When you try to rationalize that Mr. Dulles is right , then I think it is time something should be said about principles . Why is it , if you believe in the American Way of Life ( I presume that this is synonymous with democracy ) , that you recognize Chiang ? If you recognize Communist Russia 's government , why not recognize Communist China 's government ? <P> J. CAMERON BROWN <P> Virden , Man <P> Sir : <P> The cries of public and press remind me of the mewling of babies . I refuse to believe that we as a nation have become so yellow , or so ignorant of what Communism has in store for us . <P> JAMES S. BURDETT <P> Miami <P> More About the Murrays <P> Sir : <P> The Oct. 6 article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pressured into taking more hours of lessons than they could afford . My wife and I are very satisfied lifetime members of the Philadelphia studio . The value we have received is well worth what it has cost ; the interest it has given us in self-expression , the objectives and the challenge to our abilities have provided an expansion of our enjoyment of social contacts . <P> ROBSON L. GREER <P> St. Davids , Pa . <P> Sir : <P> Your article on the Arthur Murray dance studios beautifully blasts the Murrays and their methods . The undersigned , finding himself in drastic financial straits , found it necessary a few years back to work for Kathryn and Arthur 's principal competitor . Same story but different cast . I was on the other end and taught the wealthy ladies . Shall I show you my Sales Manual ? <P> BOB ROBERTS <P> New York City <P> Sir : <P> You mentioned in your Oct. 13 issue that Gloria , wife of Novelist James ( Some Came Running ) Jones , was a onetime stand-in for Marilyn Monroe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray teacher . <P> MRS . ARTHUR MURRAY <P> New York City <P> A Dime for the Rock
