txt During these anxious and swift-moving days we should keep in mind that the important thing is not whether the forces of the West hold Korea , but that a common effort has been mobilized to try to prevent the fall of one country ? it could be any country  --  to naked force . Korea itself may well be lost . The Korean Army has proved disappointing in the first phase of military operations . There is no evidence yet that the Korean people as a mass are taking an effectively active interest in behalf of their own independence . The burden falls increasingly on the military forces coming in from outside under the aegis of the United Nations . If the Korean people themselves rally to their own defense , then Korea can in all probability be rescued and revived . But if they fail to rally , then eventually the forces now giving them their chance must retire . The United States is not putting its military forces into Korea to gain military bases . American military opinion long since judged Korea to be military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force thinking is equally opposed to establishing any permanent United States positions on Korea . A From the strictly military point of view , they want nothing to do with Korea , and will get out at the first possible moment . In the long run , Korea can be sustained only by the will of its own people to retain their independence . If they fail to demonstrate that will , then Korea will be lost . It could be lost very soon . Certainly it would be far better to try in Korea , and succeed , than to try , and fail . Failure would give the Comintern propagandists a useful weapon . They could argue that events in Korea prove a preference among Asiatic peoples for Russian communism over western freedom . The argument would be specious , but it undoubtedly would impress many persons . But that is not the important thing . The important thing is that the effort was made ; that the United States proved that it learned the lessons of nonintervention and appeasement in the ' 30 's ; proved that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done of recent years to save the West .  - -  AAA If this effort had not been made , it is almost certain that the great coalition would have fallen apart . What has not been sufficiently realized or admitted publicly over here is that the winter of 1949-1950 was a period of declining faith in the cause of the West . Europe particularly began to doubt the sincerity of the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Pact and the United Nations and everything else involved in the common security of the western world . There was a frightening degeneration in the atmosphere which showed itself in Europein a rising urge to neutralism , in the startling numbers of persons in all European countries who would sign the Stockholm petition , in an atmosphere of defeatism . This degeneration of western morale , this creeping lack of faith , was checked for the first time by the Schuman Plan and talk of " new weapons . " But it was not exorcised for all time . The fear that the will of Moscow was a stronger mental quantity than the will of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news of the march of an invading army across a frontier . A A A If the military effort to rescue Korea fails , then Korea is lost , and there is propaganda discomfort to us , and it will be in order to examine the methods which failed so signally to set up an effective government in South Korea . But that is the sum of it . If the military effort to rescue Korea had not been made , all the labors of five years probably would have come to naught and we would have seen a cringing Europe plodding off one by one to make its peace with Moscow . We may hope that the Korean cause is not a lost cause . But we should also remember that the bigger cause has been won no matter what the outcome in Korea . The faith of the West has been confirmed and renewed . We and our friends now have the proof we all needed of each other 's sincerity .                 @ @ @ @
