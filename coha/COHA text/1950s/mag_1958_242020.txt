Sending his Pentagon reorganization legislation to Congress last week , President Eisenhower opened the floodgates on the great debate and waited . He did not have long to wait for a Niagara from the man who has long rained over military matters in Congress : Georgia 's seasoned , sharp-tongued Democrat Carl Vinson , 74 , member of the House for 43 years , chairman of the old House Naval Affairs Committee for 16 years , and unchallenged czar of the Armed Services Committee for seven of the eleven years of its life . <P> Some folks dare to call Vinson " Uncle Carl , " and sometimes " The Swamp Fox , " after the Revolution 's great strategist , Francis Marion . In committee hearings Uncle Carl 's slow drawl and subtle digs ( " Wha'd'ya say yer name wuz , Gen'ral ? " ) can shake stars and tangle braid . Though he has long been a stalwart defender of a big Navy , knowledgeable Carl Vinson is also a wise , powerful force for a strong military establishment . But Ike 's plan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If ever there was an open invitation to the concept of the ' man on horseback , ' this proposal is it , " he intoned . The President , he declared , was trying to set up " a Prussian-type supreme command " that would eliminate military responsibilities of the service Secretaries , grant too great flexibility to the Defense Secretary in spending congressional appropriations-in effect , shut out Congress ' watchful eye . " I know of no concept more dangerous . " <P> Unity , Unity , Unity . The President was ready for the debate with his first public speech in behalf of his program . Before the American Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington , Ike knocked down each of Carl Vinson 's objections without mentioning the objector . " The purpose is clear , " he said . " It is safety with solvency . The country is entitled to both . " His double-barreled theme : " billions for defense ; not one cent for heedless waste " and " unity-unity in strategic planning , unity in military command , unity in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the program , predicted Ike , will come not from the military but from " outside sources , " obviously meaning the Navy League and service-oriented industries . " It will be said that the changes . . . will merge our traditional forces into a single armed service . This is not so ... I repeat-there will be : <P> " No single Chief of Staff ; <P> " No Prussian staff ; <P> " No czar ; <P> " No $40 billion blank check ; <P> " No swallowing up of the traditional services ; <P> " No undermining of the constitutional powers of Congress . " <P> Better Squeeze . Ike did sidestep one aspect of the plan that has a riptide potential . The fiscal flexibility that he wants for the Defense Secretary , enabling the Secretary to shift as much as 10% of the total defense budget within and among the services , is one of Congressman Vinson 's chief targets . The President carefully avoided mentioning this in his legislative proposal , instead announced that he will ask for such flexibility on behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . He is confident that his program has a better chance of squeezing through a Congress that has proprietary sentiments about purse strings .
