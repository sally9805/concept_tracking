AT BELTSVILLE MD .. just off Route 1 , north of Washington . D.C .. chemists are putting foods through a glass stomach to determine what 's good for our own . The glass stomach is only a bottle . But the chemists ? working for the Bureau of Human Nutrition and Home Economics , U. S. Department of Agriculture ? have learned to make it act like a real stomach in breaking down protein . That is important because it leads to a quick procedure ? using test bugs called lactobacilli ? for determining the quality of protein . And this . in turn . is important because it leads to ways for conserving this foodstuff and for finding new sources . Protein is so basic to life that a Dutch chemist 115 years ago appropriately named it from the Greek word meaning " first , " vet most of the world has too little of it . Maybe you 've thought protein was protein . except that in steak it tasted somewhat better than in beans . That 's wrong . Beltsville scientists some years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same except that one group got its protein from peanuts and the other from lentils . Alter three months , the first rats were sleek and healthy ; the others , scrawny and sick . Building Blocks Missing Why ? Because the protein in lentils contains very little cvstine and methionine ? two of the 22 building blocks from which protein is made . These building blocks are called amino acids . When you eat protein , your body breaks it down into the separate blocks and then uses these to make its own protein compounds ? which vary widely , depending on whether they go into muscle , gamma globulin , an enzyme , or some other structure vital to your existence . The body can manufacture a dozen or so of the building blocks itself , but it has to get the others by breaking down the proteins you eat . These others are known as the essential amino acids ; if they are n't in your diet in sufficient quantity . something goes wrong . Glass Stomach Speeds Analysis That 's where the glass stomach comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food 's amino-acid content . It works like this : The chemists , who are led by Dr. Millard J. Horn , grind about a spoonful of the food to be tested and drop it into a  | four-ounce bottle . They add the two main digestive agents found in the human stomach . Then they take the bottle to the hot room . This is kept at body temperature ? 98.6 degrees ? by thermostatically controlled electric heaters . Here they clamp the bottle to a tumbling machine , a motor-driven cylinder fitted with a wooden sleeve holding 24 bottles , and this apparatus gently turns it over and over , end to end . in a process resembling the churning of the human stomach . Next clay the chemists add just enough sodium phosphate to alkalize the contents and thus match the conditions of partly digested food in the human being as it passes from the stomach into the intestine . Then they sprinkle in some trypsin , the main enzyme found in the  | intestine , and let the bottle tumble in the hot room for another 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powdered hog micosa. or intestinal lining . Like the lining of the human intestine . this contains a dozen or more enzymes . In another 24 hours of tumbling . the amino acids are as free from their linkages with one another and with other materials as they can be gotten in a natural digestive process . Bugs Need Same Amino Acids as Man The food as digested by the glass stomach is now ready for the test hugs . These are lactobacilli ? micro-organisms that produce lactic acid . They are found in cheese . milk , silage and soil . Providentially , the lactobacilli require the same amino acids as mean , and they have to have them in the free state ; they ca n't break down proteins to get them . The digested food sample is diluted with water to bring it to a standard volume . about a pint , so that samples taken from it can he precisely the same size as those from other glass stomachs . Then the samples are placed in test tubes along with the sugar . salts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used to drop in the organisms . Each test tube gets one drop , and each drop contains half a million organisms . For three days an incubator keeps the tubes at about 95 degrees . which is the temperature the lactobacilli like best . How , well the organisms grow depends upon how well their needs for amino acids are met by the food from the glass stomach . If the needs arc well met , the bacteria produce so such lactic acid that it makes the solution cloudy . But the scientists do n't depend on appearances . By a process called titration , they precisely measure the lactic acid . Maybe the test sounds like a lot of work , and certainly months of thinking and of trial-and-error experiments were required to set it up and prove it . " But , " Dr. Horn points out , with the glass stomach we can determine the protein value of food in six days , and we can run 24 foods at a time . What we can now do in a week would take a year with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simpler than cleaning rat cages . First Test ? Cottonseed Meal The glass stomach 's first job has been to digest cottonseed meal ? dozens of samples of it . Cottonseed meal is a pretty good protein : not as good as soybean meal but much better than wheat flour . Cottonseed meal is now widely used as feed , but the meal from one processing plant may be considerably more nutritious than from another . The glass stomach told why . In extracting the oil . some plants cook the seeds at higher temperatures or for longer periods than other plants . Placed in the  | glass stomach . the meal from these factories released a smaller quantity of amino acids . Along with continuing tests on cottonseed meals . Dr. Horn 's group recently began putting other protein-containing foods through the glass stomach . The findings are n't complete , but here are two general ones your favorite cook might like to know about : ? You ca n't do much damage to animal proteins ? meat , eggs , cheese ? unless you actually burn them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich in the essential amino acids as a slice of medium or rare . ? But you can hurt vegetable proteins . Cooking may cut their nutritive value by from 30 to 50 percent . The higher the temperature at which you cook a vegetable and the longer you cook it , the lower its protein value drops . These findings stem from tests on various kinds of peas and beans . and on corn , wheat , oats , rice and barley . Explanation for Lowered Protein Why does heat lower the protein value of lima beans . for example and not of pork ? Perhaps . the Beltsville group answers , because vegetables contain carbohydrates ? sugar and starch ? and in the heating process some of the amino acids become so entangled with these that the stomach . whether glass or animal . can not free them for use .  | Ought we to cat our vegetables raw ? " No. " replies Dr. Horn , but if you want to conserve their protein values , cook them with as little heat as possible . Cut down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of heat is 10 times as important . " Dr. Horn suspects that the ideal cooking method , which he has n't yet tested , will turn out to be electronic . Now what ? Since Horn is a scientist , his main job at the moment is to write a scientific paper explaining the Beltsville method in such detail that other scientists can put it to work . Inquiries about it , prompted by a Department of Agriculture announcement , have already come in from nutrition authorities in food-processing companies and universities . The Armv , too , has shown interest . Corned Food to Be Tested After that . Horn wants to complete the studies on fresh food , raw and cooked , and then get to work on food that 's been stored or canned . There is some evidence that the longer a food is kept , the more of its amino acids are lost ; Horn wants to check on that . One of these days , the Beltsville group expects to help nutritionists draw up a chart showing the amino-acid content of all main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it will be easier for you to balance your proteins . And if anyone wants to use the glass-stomach method to test the protein quality of converted sawdust , cultivated algae , or anything else that might ease world food shortages , he is welcome .  |
