John Knox , Scotland 's 16th century thunderer against popery , would have preached himself hoarse at the thought . On South Uist , North Uist and Benbecula ( pop . some 5,000 ) , an island group in Scotland 's Outer Hebrides . Protestants and Catholics have banded together with a single goal : to drive out the Sassenach . <P> Last month Britain 's Royal Air Force told some 200 South Uist crofters that they would be evicted to make room for a rocket-testing range . With their thatched cottages and small , thin-soiled farms in danger , the South Uist crofters-80% Catholics , the rest Church of Scotland Protestants-marshaled behind one leader : Father John Morrison , a local crofter 's son . <P> Normally a tranquil man who loves shooting and fishing ( he advises cardinal flies dosed with Vat 69 ) , Father Morrison fired off an appeal to the newspapers : " S.O.S. , S.O.S. to all Scotsmen . . . Let us prove that Scotsmen can fight for their precious heritage . " To 1,000 crofters of both faiths at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 9,000 aliens " ( 4,000 soldiers and their families ) would wreak havoc with the livestock , tweed , seaweed and egg-packing industries . Said he : " The range will have to be built over our dead bodies . " When the Air Ministry showed no disposition to re-roost its rockets , 16 crofters flew to England to harass the aliens on TV . Last week Father Morrison began talking ominously of his " trump card , " a scheme to have the entire flock of crofters emigrate to Canada . " It would cause a revolution in Scotland , " he prophesied . Of his own role in the fight , Morrison says : " The tradition here is that the clergy are the leaders . " He adds wryly : " I communicate with the bishop on other matters , but not on this one . Probably one of these days he 'll telephone to excommunicate me. "
