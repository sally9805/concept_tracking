The strike of some 1,200 American Airlines pilots ended this week . They had been out for three weeks , grounding 385 daily nights and throwing thousands of other American employees out of work . Main issue : American 's nonstop coast-to-coast nights , which kept some air crews in the air more than eight hours a day-despite the fact that the schedule had been approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board ( TIME , Aug. 9 et seq . ) . By last week the pilots seemed to be looking for a way out , and federal mediators gave them one . According to the proposal , accepted by both sides , American would : <P> Resume its coast-to-coast flights . <P> Continue its $1,250,000 suit against the A.F.L. Air Line Pilots Association . 1 Not ask the crews to fly more than eight continuous hours on other runs . <P> Meanwhile , a neutral umpire agreeable to both sides would study the issues involved and make recommendations for a final settlement .                @ @ @ @ @
