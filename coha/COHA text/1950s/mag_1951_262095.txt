The lingo used by sociologists and such annoys many reasonable people . Richard D. Fay of M.I.T. is one of them . Last week the Washington Star picked up a letter he had written to the Harvard Alumni Bulletin in which he showed how the " Gettysburg Address " would sound , lumbered up in that lingo : <P> " Eight and seven-tenths decades ago , the pioneer workers in this continental area implemented a new group based on an ideology of free boundaries and initial conditions of equality . We are now actively engaged in an overall evaluation of conflicting factors . . . We are met in an area of maximum activity among the conflicting factors . . . to assign permanent positions to the units which have been annihilated in the process of attaining a steady state . This procedure represents standard practice at the administrative level . <P> " From a more comprehensive viewpoint , we can not assign - we can not integrate - we can not implement this area . . . The courageous units , in being annihilated . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple arithmetical operations to include our efforts would produce only negligible effects . . . <P> " It is preferable for this group to be integrated with the incompleted implementation . . . that we here resolve at a high ethical level that the deceased shall not have been annihilated without furthering the project - that this group . . . shall implement a new source of unhampered activity- and that political supervision composed of the integrated units , for the integrated units , and by the integrated units shall not perish from . . . this planet . " <P> <P> In Washington last week , the Air Force tried to describe some new electronics equipment . " Special emphasis , " it announced " has been placed on miniaturization and ruggedization . " Meaning : the equipment will be smaller and tougher .
