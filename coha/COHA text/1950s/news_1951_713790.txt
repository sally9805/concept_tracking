DAVIES ' special to THE NEW YORE TIMES . SAN FRANCISCO , April 18 -- 4 General of the Army Douglas Mac ? Arthur brought to a climax one of the greatest receptions ever given . to a famous visitor by San Fran ? cisco with the announcement today that he did not intend to run for political office . To an estimated 100,000 persons massed before City Hall , with a sign " for President " displayed a few feet behind him by a fellow occupant of the reviewing stand , the former supreme commander in the Far East confessed he had just been asked " if I intend to enter politics . " " My reply was ' no , ' " he declared . " I have no political aspirations whatsoever . I do not intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name will never be used in any political way . " Many in the crowd cheered and applauded at this . Then the fivestar general , who last week lost all of his Far East commands in a policy disagreement with the Truman Administration , went on to say : " The only politics I have is contained in the simple phrase known well by all of you : God bless America . " Paper Showers Descend This declaration , the signal for more cheering , followed a two-hour tour through the financial and shopping district during which ticker tape , confetti and torn telephone books showered down on throngs that pressed against the slowly moving automobile parade with General at its head . Repeating the words , " marvelous , " " tremendous " and " magnifi ? cent " as the caravan wound its way down Market Street and between the skyscrapers of Montgomery , the " Wall Street of the West , " the general appeared as impressed as were most of the veteran police officers and cal leaders who marvelled at the enthusiastic turnout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in San Francisco was ended as the wheels of General 's big plane , the Bataan , left the runway at the San Francisco Airport to bear him to Washington to address a joint meeting of Congress tomorrow : Lacking four minutes , it had been seventeen hours since the 71-year-old hero of Bataan , wearing his frayed old battle cap and trenchcoat , had stepped down a runway to the United States mainland for the first time in fourteen years . He had come in at night , expecting , he said , to make his way quietly into the city . Airplanes Join in Welcome Instead he stepped into a tumultuous group that almost literally swept him off his feet as it shoved him along on probably one of the most unorthodox honor guard in. spections in military history . From that moment the enthusiasm was unrestrained and civic leaders , including Governor Earl Warren of California , described the demon ? strations of last night and today , as without parallel in their memories . " day " got under way at 9:45 A. M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis Hotel to the cheers of onlookers in Union Square . The caravan , with its solemn looking guest seated in the lead car with Governor Warren and Mayor Elmer E. Robinson , moved away with feathers from much abused hotel pillows floating down upon it . Airplanes flew overhead , one trailing a banner , with a " Welcome General " sign . General was kept busy salut  --  ing and way . ing to the pressing crowds . , Anthony Story , pilot of his- planed walked over much of the route pro ? tecting Mrs. from well M'ARTHUR REJECTS A ROLE IN POLITICS Continued From Page 1 meaning admires who frequently tried to rush the car in which she rode with her son , Arthur , and Mrs. Warren and Mrs. Robinson . Amateur photographers swarmed the route and autograph hunters never were bolder . 51 Minutes Late at City Hall Fifty-one minutes behind schedule , the caravan arrived at City Hall . General and occupants of the other cars joined eighty other dignitaries on the speakers ' stand and John F. Neylan , attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the formal session by asserting that there was nothing in the history of civilization to compare with General 's stewardship of Japan . He introduced Governor Warren . " Is n't it great to have General home today ? " the Governor asked . A flood of cheers rolled back on him in answer . Governor Warren said the gen eral was a man who had known every experience of a fighting man , , had suffered adversity and " through Christian leadership " had " felt exaltation by lifting a beaten ' nation of 80,000,000 to new heights , " to an " honorable position . " To Mayor Robinson it was an especially important day for this city because " in 1937 , " he told General , " you and Mrs. sailed as bride and groom from San Francis-co . " This drew a smile from the Pacific warrior and caused Mrs. , seated on the opposite side of the speaker , to wave to her husband . It was General 's turn to speak . He stood before the loudspeakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began : " I can not tell you what it means to be home  --  how I have longed for it , dreamed of it , through dreary years of absence abroad . " " My emotions , " he went on , " almost defy description as I find myself once ? more among our own people , once more under the spell of the great American home , which breeds such magnificent men as I have just left , fighting the battle in Korea . " Theirs is a cause and a limitation which require both courage and determination , and I can tell you they have met the test in every way . They are splendid . " General said it had been his privilege recently to welcome to Japan California 's own Fortieth Division , not for assign-1 ment in Korea , but " to serve a no , less vital purpose , to defend , in Japan , if need be , the bastions which we have helped to erect there in our pattern of American democracy . " " The arrival of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " signalizes to Japanese people the firm determination of this country to repel any predatory attack that might eventuate . It is my fervent hope that events may render their stay a short one and that they may return without commitment to war . They are adding to the magnificent record of the past national service of California citizens . " The general added : " Speaking for both Mrs. and myself I can not tell you how deep is our appreciation for the wonderful hospitality with which this great city has wel comed us . The memory of it will live in nur hearts always . " Mrs. Receives Tribute Mayor Robinson turned to Mrs. , dressed in ' a purple suit with black coat . He asked her to meet the cheering audience but her husband crowded up to the microphone . " May I add this ? " General remarked . " This not only is my beloved wife but my best soldier . " The former Jean Faircloth , who has shared the general 's life in its vicissitudes , dangers , moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by torpedo boat early in the war , stepped back to the microphones and simply said : " Thank you very much . " Their 13-year-old son , Arthur , seeing America for the first time , was called upon next by the Mayor . The boy , dressed in a red jacket with fur collar , hardly could reach the microphones by standing on tiptoe . His first effort sounded very much like , " Thanks , I 'm so glad to be here . " He moved to another position and tried again . Then his father stepped up and boomed out : " He says he 's so glad to be home . " Now the crowds were pushing harder than ever against the police lines . It was fully fifteen minutes before General could disengage himself from the well wishers in the speaker 's stand , scores of whom wanted to shake his hand . Thousands who had waited in civic center for nearly three hours before tile ceremony began gave the police a bad time . Linking arms as a human chain against the crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cars in the caravan to pass through , Several persons fainted , more than a dozen children were lost from their parents . Called Greatest Demonstration Police Lieut . Maurice Reardon , who since boyhood has seen San Francisco receptions to Presidents from the day of William , swore that the demonstration topped them all . The police traffic bureau put the crowd last night at 300,000 and said today 's throng numbered about the same . Many persons hotly disagreed and put the figure at a half million or more . " Why , 300,000 persons stepped on my feet , " complained a visiting newspaper man . Amid shouts of " Good-by , Mac , " the auto caravan moved from the City Hall ceremony to the San Francisco Airport , where the Bataan waited for its distinguished passenger in front of the international terminal . It was the same spot to which it had rolled last night after the flight from Honolulu . Once more an honor guard of four platoons from the Thirtieth Engineers ' base topographical battalion was present from Fort Winfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preston H. Blum , who saw World War II service in many a Pacific campaign , waited as the guard 's conimanding officer . Two hundred military policemen were stationed about the field . The two 75 mm , cannon that fired a seventeen-gun salute last night on General 's arrival were retained at the field to do similar honors on his departure . Nineteen minutes before the take-off General arrived and was driven to a point near the plane . Stepping briskly forward , the general took the seventeen-gun salute at attention and paid his respects to the colors of the honor guard . Bugles and drums played the traditional " ruffles and flourishes " and the Sixth Army went into the " General 's March . " Other members of the party had gone into the plane , all except Colonel Story . Preceding the general aboard were Maj. Gen. Courtney Whitney , his secretary ; Col. Sidney L. Huff , his senior aide , and Mrs. Huff ; Col. Larry E. Bunker , aide ; Col. Charles Canada , his physician ; Sgt. Francisco Valbuena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur 's eempanion . They waved to the crowd of a thousand or so and Mrs. went inside . Arthur followed her . The general turned for a last wave , a half salute , and stepped after his son . ' Colonel Story , announcing he planned to make the flight to the National Airport in Washington in eight hours and fifteen minutes , went aboard and the door was slammed shut . The motors started and the Constellation taxied to the end of the airport 's 8,500-foot runway . Colonel Anthony , at the controls , asked for permission to take off after the engines had been warmed up . The engines roared and the plane was airborne at 1:25 P. M. What General planned to tell Congress was forecast like this by General Whitney : " He , will give a broad and general picture of the Far East as he sees it and knows it . " When someone wanted to know whether General 's home-coming might be termed aggressive , General Whitney replied , " General is always aggressive .

Despite his late retirement he was up at 7 o'clock and began conferring with his aides . A breakfast of bacon , eggs ( soft boiled for the general and fried for Mrs. ) , orange juice and toast was rolled into the room . Speech Revised " 20 Times " General Whitney joined his fivestar leader at breakfast and they . worked further on tomorrow 's speech to Congress . According to Colonel Huff , the general has put " intensive work " on the speech and it has been " written and rewritten at least twenty times . " The general 's wife , who had ordered many of her clothes from San Francisco during her years abroad , apparently had hoped to do some shopping but the late opening of local stores ruled that out . . She was intrigued with television . General turned down a request for a television appearance for himself but he accepted for his wife and son . While they were being televised they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , oh for goodness sake , " Mrs. exclaimed . It was her first experience with television and she confessed ' she was fascinated , " Lots of things have certainly been added since we were here last , " she said . Mrs. was a heroine to many of the women spectators along the line of march . An elderly woman ran out among the motorcycles to pat her affectionately . Other women risked life or limb to touch her sleeve . One dragged . her 4-year-old boy into the path of a motorcycle , then snatched the child out of the way .
