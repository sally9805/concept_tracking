I CAME BACK FROM A RED DEATH CELL By ROBERT T. BRYAN , JR. , as told to MILTON LEHMAN FIRST OF FOUR PARTS 0 0 begin with , it 's a miracle I 'm alive . For sixteen months , seventeen days and six hours , I was imprisoned as a spy by the Chinese communists . I 've carefully marked the time , setting the boundaries of suffering for my own sanity . The place was Shanghai 's Ward Road Jail , China 's monumental prison . Other Americans are in Red China 's prisons today and their fates are unknown . Some , like Bishop Francis X. Ford , did riot survive , but died helpless in a land that now has neither communion nor language we can share . The first miracle is that I survived the nightmare of torture , abuse and slow starvation to tell what . happened . On June 29 , 1952 , when I crossed the rickety railroad trestle at Shumchun in communist China for Hong Kong and freedom , I felt beaten , speechless , and a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swollen with beri-beri ; my head was clipped bald in convict style ; my face , painfully scraped with a dull razor , was garnished with stubble where my " barber " has missed his mark ; I had lost forty-seven pounds and was so thin and scrawny that I had to hold my pants to keep them from falling down , trying absurdly for dignity . Considering facts as the communists judge them , it is a second miracle that I was ever released . No American , I think , had less to recommend him to the mercies of the Chinese communists than 1 . First , I have been a lifelong student of China , born and raised in Shanghai , and I speak excellent Chinese . The Chinese for centuries have distrusted foreigners who speak their language oven poorly , andcommunists consider them as dangerous as spies . Second , I urn an attorney , a profession loathed by communist governments because attorneys often assist the individual against the power of the state . Finally , and most damaging , I had served as municipal advocate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communists were underground , working their way to power . In this unfortunate post . I handled about 11,000 cases involving communists in criminal offenses and secured at least 10,000 convictions . In the line of duty , I was also unhappily snarled in some 3000 extradition cases involving certain communist conspirators who were in the International Settlement of Shanghai , but were wanted elsewhere by the Chinese Nationalist Government for prosecution . Although ! took an impartial stand in their cases , most of them were handed over to the Nationalist authorities and probably bore me no good will . In prison , I tried not to dwell on these folks  --  who were then doing extremely well for themselves ? and I hoped nobody in the Weird Road Jail would think of them . But I could never forget their names : Miss Shill Liang , the present Minister of Justice of the People 's Government ; Mr. Shen Chun-ju , now president of the People 's Supreme Court ; and Mrs. Chen Mno-sze , whose husband did best of all . Mrs. Mao Was the third wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . Weighing my case as I think the communists did , I simply can not account for my release . Neither the United States nor any other government paid ransom for my freedom . Our Department of State , in fact , had no representation in Red China . The State Department , virtually powerless , did what it could in dealing through the British . who remained in Peiping , but were still not on official speaking terms with the People 's Government . There were other factors which might have helped , but 1 would n't testify to them in court . My wife Gertrude argued my case with high courage , first in Shanghai , where she called on abusive dials of the People 's Government , and later in Washington , D.C .. where she begged our willing but inevitably handicapped officials to fight my case . Meanwhile , in Ward Road Jail , I prayed again and again to God for guidance . Today , I am once more an attorney in a country of laws and reason , a fact I find as remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reason , 1 still remember my days in Ward Road Jail as strange and scarcely believable , coming back to me in bits and pieces , like the floating scenes of a dream : The sudden knocking of the police one winter morning . . . my first cell with its special ominous meaning ... the endless diet of rice and pickled cabbage that led me to hunger strikes ... the dozens of letters I wrote at arm 's length because my bifocals were taken , pleading my case on Chinese toilet paper . . . the companionship of brutal , cursing guards called the Tiger , the Rat , the Small Turtle , the Snake and the Dragon . solitary confinement for months and , then , briefly , a cellmate with an important message . the insane process of " brain washing " and my desperate efforts to tell them what they wanted to hear ... the beating , twisting of handcuffs , and " truth serum " with its actual floating sensation , and a voice purring with pleasure : " You told the truth , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , t he weirdest scene of all when I stood before Mr. Doo , a violent little communist with a one-track mind , as be bound me to the incredible agreement I now propose to keep . They Wanted the Truth  --  and Here it Is " DO LIA.NG . " Mr. Doo had said , using the name I/ the Chinese gave me for Bryan , " the People 's Government has decided to be magnanimous in your case . You should be grateful . You have been the run- 1 ning dog of President Truman , Dean Acheson and Chiang Kai-shek . You have been a very great enemy of the People 's Government . But you have changed your thinking and we have decided to grant you a pardon . Are you well , Bo Liang ? " " I am all right , " I said . " I 'm in very good health . " " If you are not all right , you must tell me . " " I am all right . " ? " Then listen , Bo Liang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there you must speak the truth . You must tell the truth about the People 's Government . Bo Liang. " be said , and he pounded on the table , " do you promise to tell the truth when you go to America ? " " Yes , sir , " I said to Mr. Doo . " I promise to tell the truth . I will not tell any lies . " And now I am telling this and what follows to fulfill our astounding contract . My story begins in Shanghai , where I was born on October 13. 1892 , of missionary parents . My father was Robert T. Bryan , a Baptist missionary who settled in Shanghai and spent his life bringing Christianity to the Chinese people . My Sundays were devoted to church and Bible . On weekdays , I was the only American in the Ming Jung Academy , a Chi11436 ? mission achool , where wo memorized the Chinese classics and bawled them at the top of our voices  --  the Throe-Character Rhyme , ! Ind the Four Boole ' , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home town . There I grew up , speaking better Chinese than English and respecting my father 's counsel that all men were brotheni . My first playmate was the cook 's son . He was Au Chi , " The Chicken , " and I was Lo Boh , " The Turnip , " and together we learned the games all Chinese youngsters play and explored our Shanghai neighborhood . I married , practiced law and raised my children in Shanghai ? Cedar , Alice 11:141 Peggy . My first wife , Gladys Parker , died in 1925 . Later I married Gertrude Berndt , a teacher at the Shanghai American School , who became the devoted mother of my children . In Shanghai , where I lived forty-five of my sixty years , I saw at firsthand China 's complex , tragic ordeal , an ordeal I came to share . A few words about Shanghai now will set the stage for the strange events to follow . In my lifetime , I saw Shanghai grow from a small town to a great thriving city . Until World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western world , a rich and colorful outpost of western civilization in the very heartland of the East . In 1842 , Shanghai began its cosmopolitan career when the British steamed up the Whangpoo in gunboats and obliged the Chinese to grant them a concession . The British merchants , followed by Americana , French , Dutch , Italians , Swedes and others , came to Shanghai to establish a new base for foreign trade , and for more than a century trade flourished . Along with the merchants came the missionaries to spread the Gospel . The merchants and their governments bargained for Shanghai with the Chinese , and received for their investments a haven that was virtually safe from plundering warlords and changeable governments , from the whimsical bureaucracies , laws and faxes of China . Through extraterritorial grants by China , the International Settlement was formed . At one time , there were forty-four different nationalities in the city and fifteen powers in the International Settlement with extraterritorial rights . Shanghai and its merchants prospered . The city blended together mission churches and banks , office buildings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanghai its reputation as " Paris of the East . " For the foreign colony , Shanghai was gay and sparkling  --  there were daily tea dances and balls at the Astor House . the Palace and the Park ; banquets and celebrations at the country and city clubs of many nationalities ; and always excitement at the Racecourse , with its pari-mutuele and Champion 's Day each spring , when wives and daughters turned out in their best new clothes . But Shanghai was also a haven for criminals and refugees , and a sanctuary for conspirators of the warring secret societies , who came here whenever the going got too rough . Shanghai was a barometer of the pressures within China and usually jammed with refugees from one terror or another . Shanghai was prosperous and promising when I returned in 1917 with my Law degree from the University of North Carolina . As a young attorney with a brand-new shingle , I soon found plenty to do . Being bilingual and knowing the Chinese people , 1 appeared before United States , Chinese and extraterritorial courts in Shanghai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mysteries of foreign and . Chinese law and judges . I discovered quickly that Chinese judges based their decisions principally on moral rather than legal grounds  --  that a Shanghai lawyer had better study his judge first and his case second . After eleven years of private practice , I knew my way in the courts . In 1928 , however , I was persuaded to leave my thriving practice and enter the employ of the Shanghai Municipal Council . The council was the administrative body for the International Settlement . At that time Chinese nationalism was on the rise and the Nationalist Government was making inroads on the council 's administrative rights . According to the United States consul general , who called me into his office , the council needed a Chinese-speaking municipal advocate , or public prosecutor , to protect the Settlement . No one but me would do , the consul declared . With no appetite for the job , I reluctantly accepted . In my fourteen years as municipal advocate , I tried three times to resign . Each time , the United States consul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no American or Englishman in town who knows Chinese like you do . You 're indispensable and we simply wo n't let you resign . " In prison , where the job finally landed me , I often recalled the consul 's fine tribute . As municipal advocate , 1 held a poet that no American district attorney could imagine in his worst nightmares . Shanghai , I discovered , was the world 's champion in major crime . Next to Shanghai , Chicago , Illinois , that favorite symbol of crime for critics of the United States , was about as innocent as the Garden of Eden . In fourteen years , my eight Chinese assistants and I were not only responsible for civil cases and legal work for the Municipal Council . we were also called on to handle more than 280,000 criminal cases  --  murder , kidnaping , rape , larceny , extortion , embezzlement I Its inut other major offense &; Some days we handled as many as 300 cases , and we managed to build up a record of about 93 per cent convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese justice , over which we had no control . Chinese courts , even in the moat serious canes , were conducted without benefit of jury . All questions were asked by the judges , and counsel was permitted only to make an opening statement and a closing argument . Chinese police and detectives were eager to bring culprits to speedy justice , since so many new cases piled up daily that the station houses were always overcrowded . The judges also wished to hurry the cases along . They accepted all available evidence and gave the defendant time to answer and they required thorough investigation by the police . But neither the judges nor Chinese court procedure allowed the objections , arguments and cross-examinations by attorneys appearing in Anglo-Saxon courts . I always disliked this breakneck Chinese legal procedure and hated my role of prosecutor , fearful that innocent men might be judged guilty . Many times I would caution the police to slow down and in court , when I was recognized , I frequently said , " Kwei sheng pan chang , thing man i tren ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . " Still , I kept at the job , fearing that an advocate less familiar with Chinese justice might not do so well . Later , when I was subjected to communist law , I looked back on these days as the height of justice . For all that , it was a thankless job . My record of convictions made me no friends among the communists , as already noted , nor among the Nationalists either , since I prosecuted both with impartiality . Many of these sentences called for death , and I was always declining the grim invitation of the Shanghai police to watch sentence carried out . Thousands were sent to the Ward Road Jail , Shanghai 's mammoth penal institution and the most modern in the Orient . Ward Road Jail was supervised by the Municipal Council , and I made faithful monthly inspection trips there as municipal advocate ? ten years before I was sent there myself as prisoner . Despite my harrowing job , the office of municipal advocate was not a somber place . There was always too much work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . One , a precise English grammarian , we called " Tick Tock " because he walked on his heels and could always be heard coming down the hall . Another attorney named Chiang we called " The General , " because he had the same family name as the Nationalist leader . A abort , moon-faced Chinese lawyer we called " The Judge , " because he was expert in appraising women and liquor . The Judge could down a whole fifth of Scotch at a sitting and stn. ' rise to recite the Hundred Family Names . He always represented me at banquets we gave for the bona fide Chineee magistrates and happily toasted each jurist with a full rice howl of : Mao siting , China 's favorite wine . " Cups of wine settle everything " was The Judge 's favorite proverb . A younger assistant tried to rival The Judge , but always got himself in trouble . Under the influence , this attorney once challenged a powerful American marines who deuced off with his girl friend , The attorney was knocked thew a for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he drank too much , argued with an important jurist , began punching him , and I had to ask for his resignation . I n my years ns municipal udvocnte , I Lived at No 87 Columbia Circle in a three-story brick house with a red tile roof . Our home was modest but comfortable , with plenty of room for three growing children and their friends . Like most Americans in Shanghai , we found that even a moderate income allowed for competent servants and pleasant living . Our No. 1 houseboy was Ah Ling , who had served my father and now agreeably dominated the new generations of Bryan , running our household with quiet efficiency . The only disturbance to our placid life came from my job as prosecutor . Once , while I was getting a shave at the Y.M.C.A. , the barber recalled that he 'd seen me before  --  in court , as a matter of fact , where I 'd sent him to prison for a year and a half . The barber gave me a good shave , though , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening nighttime calls from Chinese gangsters . After such calls , Gertrude would remind me at breakfast to carry my .32 automatic when I left for the office . In 1943 , however , my job as municipal advocate finally caught up with me . In that year , the Japanese controlled Shanghai and interned me and my wife and other Americans as enemy aliens . My children , fortunately , had left Shanghai for the United States . The Bryans , with a cartload of furniture and clothes , were packed off to Chapei , a camp north of the International Settlement . Early in my internment , my wife Gertrude , my father , who was then eighty-seven years old , my stepmother and her sister were allowed to repatriate to the United States . But 1 was Bo Liang , the former municipal advocate , and much too dangerous to release . The Japanese held me for two years and eight months . Why the Japanese bated the municipal advocate I was never quite sure . Later , I heard that several Chinese communists on the puppet police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detention . I had apparently prosecuted them several years before . As municipal advocate , I had played with fire , and now the blaze turned against me . In the internment camp , I survived on rice and vegetables , lived behind barbed wire , and tried to keep busy by organizing classes in Chinese for my fellow inmates . Whon I was released by the Japanese in 1941i , I discovered the cost of my public service . I wee flat broke . My job as municipal advocate had gone up in smoke . And my house on Columbia Circle was empty . The Japanese had used it for a time as a police station , then decided to move , and moved out with all my possessions . As the Chinese proverb goes : " 1 Vino k'u , i t'iao sheng " a had only a pair of pants and a string to hold them up ) . Shanghai , when I returned , had changed drastically and it took me a while to assemble the pieces . The United States and Great Britain bad relinquished their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the International Settlement . The foreigner in Shanghai was no longer lord of the manor . The roof bad suddenly collapsed . Extraterritoriality , with its special privilege for foreigners , had always been a fighting slogan for the Chinese communists , who brayed that China belonged to the Chinese and that the foreign barbarians must be thrown out . The communists , as well as the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek , knew that Shanghai and the other treaty ports accounted for 60 per cent of Chiang 's income . But even Chiang , sensing the flood tide of nationalism , shouted for the end of special privilege . Western statesmen with insight had long felt that extraterritoriality was undemocratic , out-of-date and ought to be relinquished . But they argued , at the same time , for safeguards to protect the International Settlement from destruction . Talking power politics , they observed that Chiang and the anticommunists would lose their chief support if the foreign merchants were put out of business . But in 1943 the United States recklessly led the way in tearing up old treaties , abandoning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free trade between East and West . The effects of this policy were clear in Shanghai on my release from internment . The International Settlement was in economic chaos , the businessmen were frenzied and the communists were ready for their final drive on Shanghai and all China . In these days before the communists swept China , I entered private practice with Cornell S. Franklin , a farmer Federal judge in Hawaii and long-time Shanghai lawyer . The firm of Franklin and Bryan took on some thirty foreign corporations ? banks , utilities , manufacturers and shipping interests  --  in their Met battle for Shanghai . With extraterritoriality ended , Chiang 's depu ties entered the privileged foreign conceesionn and showed their weakness on every flank . The Chinese dollar went up in smoke ? today $20,000 Chinese were equal to el U. S. ; the next day $1 U. 8 , would buy e40,000 Chinese . Poverty spread through the city , and in winter months , the health departmentgathered corpses of beggars frozen to death in the streets . Even traffic was totally fouled . The three-wheel pedicixbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Nationalist police shouted frantically . Merchants grown comfortable and confident were now totally dismayed . In a businessman 's nightmare , corporations which had done business in China for fifty years were suddenly required to register as foreigners through a hailstorm of forma , documents and affidavits . Banks operating in China for decades frantically applied for special licenses . Real-estate deals were hopelessly snarled and no one was sure of what he owned or how long he might own it . Taxes increased , but never MI fast as the Chinese dollar declined . As I knew then , Shanghai had reached the soft , fat and frustrated state that opens the door to communism , and the communists were already knocking at the door . I had a tough decision to make and with my wife Gertrude 's help , I reasoned it out . First of all , I knew that my role as municipal advocate would surely cause me trouble in the coming months . Each communist case I had handled was slightly explosive  --  and there were at least 14,000 such cases . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese mentality and might be able to deal with the communists , who were , after all , Chinese . Third , Shanghai was the only place where I could recoup my fallen fortunes . Finally , my daily calendar was crowded by appointments with desperate businessmen who told me my services were quite indispensable . Though I 'd heard such praise before , I did n't quite see how I could abandon my clients now . My risk was calculated and turned out as dismally as other calculations I 'd made in the past . Thus committed , I had a grandstand seat for the spectacle of communists taking over a great city . Shortly before the communists arrived , thousands of Nationalist troops came to Shanghai . Well-fed , well-uniformed and well-equipped , they noisily occupied the former International Settlement and surrounding areas . The lush residential district of Hungjao was taken over by troops who bivouacked in the old mansions , cut down ancient trees and destroyed magnificent gardens for their fields of fire . But in May , 1949 , when the thin and ill-clad communists arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy poured in without much shooting and captured Shanghai . The Nationalists , for all their fields of fire , simply ran away . The communists were ready for Shanghai and moved in deliberately . After rounding up the Nationalist stragglers , they began pasting paper slogans on walls and house doors : DOWN WITH IMPERIALISM , DOWN WITH AMERICA , DOWN WITH CHIANG KAI-SHEK . For some time they did n't disturb the businessmen , who sat over their whisky-and-sodas in their clubs , remarking that the communists appeared more reasonable than the Ns-t ionaliets . The Chinese have a word for such idle talk --  " hue la hurl /a . " For months I listened unhappily to the English hua lu lulu la Ili their Shanghai Club , to the American law la luta la at the Columbia Country Club . I remember the chairman of the British Chamber of Conunerce declaring that everything wile going to be all right . " They need us , do n't you know , " ho assured me one duly . " We 'll get along , old boy ; we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gel along . The communists applied the screws graduelly , then lighter and tighter . To raise funds , they went on an astonishing fiscal binge , finding taxes in the number of floors , the number of toilets , tight outlets and closets in your houses . All entertainment was taxed , including private dinners . The tax agents even invaded houses during a festive party , counted the guests and liquor bottles , and assessed a tax on the spot . Back home , the United States Governmenl froze all Chinese accounts , so that anyone living in China , regardless of nationality , lost access to his funds in the United States . This move was designed , among other things , to protect Americans from communist extortion . Bul the communists countered quickly , issuing an order that took over all United States enterprises . I read this order one morning in the Shanghai Liberation Daily , and went to my office still believing that the People 's Government would n't bother itself with the firm of Franklin and Bryan . The effect , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' companies , now run by communist controllers , were ordered to have no further dealings with us . Our telephone was silent all day , and when Judge Franklin went to see one of our clients , he was advised : " Please get out of here , Cornell . If my communist controller sees you , he 'll make me plenty of trouble . " There was no peace or merriment at the Shanghai clubs . The businessmen drank heavily , gloomed at their mutually disturbing affairs , and peered up whenever a newcomer arrived to report that his firm also was taken over . That day , bankers and merchants whose enterprises had lasted fifty years declared they were finished . Early in January , 1951 , officers from the Communist Bureau of Foreign Affairs called at our office , seized armfuls of documents , sealed up our files and warned us to say nothing . For several weeks I reported at my desk and amused myself by reading . I worked through some choice communist texts now on the open market  --  the History of Chinese Socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Communist Party , the New Democracy , and the Coalition Government . After more tedious reading than I cared for , I started on novels , going back to Alexandre Dumas ' The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers . After such cheerless mornings I 'd go to the Shanghai Club , where the atmosphere was bleaker , but more companionable . This unsatisfying life continued until the morning of February 12. 1951 , a Monday following a fairly happy weekend celebration of the Chinese New Year , complete with firecrackers . Gertrude and I were still in pajamas , about to dress for a normal week day . Ah Ling , our houseboy , had just taken orders for breakfast and was on his way to the kitchen when we heard a loud clatter of hobnailed boots on the stairs . Into our bedroom came four armed police of the Public Security Bureau , dressed in blue cotton wadded uniforms . They pushed Gertrude into a chair , seized me by the throat , rammed a pistol into my stomach , threw mo on a bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They examined me from head to foot , forcing my mouth open to look at my teeth , and shouted , " You 're a spy ! Do n't deny it ! You 're a spy ! You 're in the hire of the United States Navy as an intelligence officer ! " I denied all this as preposterous nonsense , declaring that I was not now and had never been in the United States Navy . They abused me some more , then presented a document from the Public Security Bureau declaring that I was in truth a spy , that I spoke perfect Chinese , which obviously made me a spy , and that I had used this knowledge against the Chinese people . " No , " I said . " I 'm not a spy . This charge is false and trumped up . " All this was getting us nowhere . In the midst of much shouting , I yelled to Gertrude in the next room that I was being arrested for espionage , which was ridiculous , and would she please take it easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to dress warmly , Bob . Wait , I 'll have Ah Ling get your woolen underwear . " Suddenly I thought that the last time I 'd worn this underwear was in Chapel , when I was interned by the Japanese . Then , as a final note , I heard a guard exclaiming , " Bo Liang , you are a spy ! You are a filthy lawyer ! You sent our comrades to death ! You sent our comrades away to the Ward Road Jail ! " Later , I learned , the police made an all-out search of my house and did n't miss much . Forcing my wife and servants to conduct the tour , they searched the house from top to bottom . They gathered a staggering pile of old letters , telephone lists , engagement books , canceled checks , receipts ancient and current , photograph al hu me , snapshots of the family , address books , books on politics , books on the United States and the Bryan family genealogy . Meanwhile . I was on my way . Ah Ling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards allowed me to carry . Then they handcuffed me , prodded me downstairs and pushed me into the hack of an American olive-drab car which was standing at the front door . With two tough thugs in the front seat , the car started down Fah Wah Road toward the center of town . Along the way , the car backfired , shuddered and jerked , and I heard my guards griping about the poor liberation gasoline , which they declared had come from Sinkiang Province . British and American gasoline , they said , was much better . As we crossed Soochow Creek . I immediately sensed that we were headed for the Ward Road Jail , which I knew too well from previous inspections as municipal advocate . When we reached that gray and dismal prison , I was led through the gates , rushed upstairs six floors and pushed into a very special cell . At once I recognized the cork floor , wane and ceiling of this chamber . My guards had brought me to the death cell .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
