txt The Kaiser Steel Corporation and the United Steelworkers of America signed a new contract today . It cracked the united front of major steel companies . The contract gives the union a package that is worth up to 223 cents an hour in the next twenty months . The company said it was too early to talk about the effect the contract would have on steel prices . The twelve major companies , headed by the United States Steel Corporation , have bargained with the union through a 104-day strike . The Kaiser strike , affecting about 7,500 employes at Fontana , Calif. , was terminated . Kaiser immediately began recalling workers to fire up furnaces at its Fontana Mill , but it is expected to take three or four weeks for the plant to get back into full production . In Pittsburgh , other steel producers informed the union and Government officials that the Kaiser settlement had made them more determined than ever to hold out . Kaiser and the union said they regarded the agreement as " a non-inflationary settlement . " Terms of Agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has been whittled down to about eight months by the strike , wage rates will not be increased but take-home pay will rise as the company takes over the payments that employes have been making on group insurance . Improvements in pen // sions and supplementary unemployment benefits will make the first-year cost of the package about 10 cents an hour . CIn the second year , . beginning July 1 , 1960 , wage rates will rise 7 cents an hour . A costof-living rise , if warranted , will add a maximum of 3 cents . The impact of these increases on incentive pay , a widening of the spread between job rate classifications , and minor fringe costs , will raise the cost of the second year package to about 12% cents . Pre-strike earnings of the steel workers averaged $3.10 an hour , cThe work-rules issue was referred to a labor-management committee with authority to resolve shop problems on the spot . This issue and the . wage package had been the two major blocks to an agreement . The companies had been insisting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union . q A committee was set lip to develop a long-range plan for the " equitable sharing of econoinic progress . " The committee will include three outside experts . They will attempt to find a formula by July 1 so that by mutual agreement it may be substituted for the second-year terms of the contract . Edgar F. ; Kaiser , board chairman of Kaiser Steel Corporation . said the impact of the contract on prices " depends on how successful we are in working with this committee on the work rules ) and on the longrange committee . " - Mr. Raiser said he regarded the long-range committee as the most important provision in the contract . In terms of any added stimulus to inflation , the package does not contain quite as much new money as the total implies at first glance . In the first place , the union traded its claim on a cost-ofliving increase in the first year . An extension of the old escalator clause would give the union a rise of 3 cents an hour now . Secondly , 3 cents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. r only if living costs warrant it . On the other hand , the employes will receive more than at first appears because of the effect of taxes . They had been paying income taxes on total earnings before withholding of the insurance payment . Now they will get their full earnings  --  the equivalent of a pay rise ? without the increased income tax that normally would accompany a wage rate increase of the equivalent amount . There is no tax ' on the payments made by the company toward the insurance ' costs . David .1 . , president of the steelworkers , in a joint news conference with Mr. Kaiser , and his associates , said : " We hereby invite all other steel companies which are shut down to come forward immediately , sign this agreement and put 500,000 steel workers back at their jobs . " The Kaiser company is the ninth largest producer and accounts for about 2 per cent of the country 's steel tonnage . Nearly 15 per cent of the country 's capacity has been operating through the strike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating tin ; der special contract extensions . Mr. Kaiser was asked whether the cost of the contract to the Kaiser corporation was the same as it would be for other steel companies . " I do n't think I could answer for the other steel . companies , " Ihe replied . He added , however , that " we question whether there has been as much difference " in costs as the other cornIpanies have claimed . Two weeks ago the steel industry 's chief bargainer , R. ConIrad Cooper , put a 32-cent price on a package estimated by the union to be worth little more ' than 20 cents . That dpackage was approximately . the one signed by Mr. Kaiser today and estimated by him at . 19% cents , without the Cost-of-living item.1 The joint announcement was made in the sub-lobby banquet room of the Sheraton Carlton Hotel after day-long meetings . The work-rules problem is not an outgrowth. of ? the new technology called automation . The old contract deals with automation satisfactorily to both sides . Where the basis of an operation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unilateral right to change the shop practices . Other rules  --  such as the size o fa crew required to perform a certain operation , unrelated to automation  --  are at issue . The companies have not identified the practices they would change if the contract authorized them to act unilaterally.
