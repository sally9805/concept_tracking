Is it legally permissible and medically ethical to abort a woman for " psychiatric reasons " ? In Britain , as in most countries , physicians and surgeons have addressed themselves diligently to this problem . Though far from unanimous in details , they have arrived at a clear consensus on the main point . The consensus : such an operation is very rarely justified . <P> In Britain , abortion is legal only if performed to save the life of the mother , though by court interpretation this has been given a broad construction : " If pregnancy is likely to make the woman a physical or mental wreck . . . a doctor who performs the abortion is operating for the purpose of preserving the life of the mother . " * The medical problem then is to decide whether letting the pregnancy take its course is " likely to make the woman a physical or mental wreck , " and doctors find it far from easy to make an accurate forecast on this score . So most general practitioners call in a psychiatrist to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there have been virtually no comparative studies showing how many emotionally ill women got better and how many got worse after an abortion-or after a normal birth . In the British Medical Journal , Psychiatrist James Arkle of Reading reported the effect in 18 cases where abortion had been considered but not performed . Three women had become psychotic during previous pregnancies , five had psychoses unrelated to pregnancy , and ten were referred for symptoms usually considered less severe , though three of these had become hysterical in previous pregnancies . A year after giving birth , the mental state of three women was improved , and in 14 there was no change . In only one case was it adjudged worse-a schizophrenic , 18 , who was unmarried . Concludes Psychiatrist Arkle : " In the vast majority of cases the decision not to intervene was the correct one as judged by the law in this country . . . It seems likely that , to an unbalanced woman , the stimulus of a normal pregnancy is less deleterious than abortion . . . The psychiatrist must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duty as a physician . " <P> Threats Are Warning . At a round table of the Royal Society of Medicine , doctors came to much the same conclusion . A mentally ill woman 's desire for abortion is strongest , they agreed , in the first three months . After that , when the fetus " quickens , " said Psychiatrist John D.W. Pearce , the desire to be rid of the baby usually subsides . The G.P. , he suggested , can often coax a woman through those first three months . Suicide threats pose a knottier problem . They can not be ignored . Yet often the woman who voices them most vociferously is using them to lash out at those around her and is not likely to carry them out . The challenge to the psychiatrist is to judge when the threats are a reliable warning signal . <P> Summed up Gynecologist William C.W. Nixon : " Of all gynecological operations , that of therapeutic abortion is the one that causes me most discomfort . Not only is there the destruction of the fetus-one can feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of the coroner 's court-deaths do occur . " <P>
