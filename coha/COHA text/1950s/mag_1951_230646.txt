Hotelman Conrad Hilton , who is never so happy as when he 's expanding , this week announced that he was moving within " ten miles of the Iron Curtain . " He will build a 300-room , ten-story hotel in Istanbul , which now has no hotel with more than 100 rooms . Like his other foreign hotels , the new Hilton will have a swimming pool , tennis courts , etc . The Turkish government is putting up $4,800,000 ( part of it under EGA guarantees ) to build it ; Hilton will provide the working capital and management for one-third of the profits . <P> The deal is similar to the one Hilton made with the Puerto Rican government two years ago ( TIME , Dec. 12 , 1949 ) on the Caribe Hilton , which has paid off handsomely . Under similar arrangements , Hilton will open a new hotel in Madrid next summer , expects to open the Cavalieri Hilton in Rome a year from then and hopes also to put one up in London .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
