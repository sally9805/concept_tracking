One by one , the fabled fleshpots of Asia-Saigon , Bangkok , Shanghai-are vanishing before the stern puritanism of new nationalistic leaders . A sordid exception was tiny Kowloon City , a kind of Asian casbah six acres in size on the tip of the mainland opposite Hong Kong . <P> In Kowloon 's alleys-some of the widest are only 6 ft. across-prostitutes peer from hundreds of dark doorways , and hordes of emaciated Chinese line up outside tiny , shuttered shops to buy pinches of heroin ( at 5 a pinch ) , then squat on a corner to inhale it through rolled paper tubes or matchbox funnels . The dingy restaurants serve dog and cat meat supplied by members of Triad , Kowloon 's secret society , which also operates the booming gambling , narcotics and prostitution rackets . <P> Hong Kong 's British government has specific laws against this sort of thing , and Kowloon City sits in a part of the so-called New Territories , which a 19th century Manchu Emperor leased to Britain as part of the crown colony . But only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the island itself some two miles away , have the British tried-not too successfully-to enforce the law there . In 1947 the British tried to clear out thousands of Kowloon squatters , but the Nationalist Chinese then ruling the mainland disputed British authority , correctly pointing out that the original lease provided for Chinese administration of Kowloon City . To reinforce their complaints Chinese demonstrators burned down the British consulate in Canton . <P> The Communists took over in China , but the status of Kowloon 's six acres was not changed . The British were content to claim authority over Kowloon City while staying out of it , letting the jungle govern itself . But last month , when a police constable was attacked and a heroin-parlor attendant stabbed to death , exasperated Hong Kong cops finally moved in on the town . In one night they arrested 150 people , and nine-man patrols began nightly dawn-to-dusk raids , concentrating on the narcotics trade . <P> The shocked thugs who operate the Triad tried psychological retaliation : they put up posters protesting police brutality , many of them signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Hong Kong police went ahead anyway last week , convinced that Red China , 15 miles away , was unlikely to intervene on behalf of dope pushers and other spivs , who if caught in Red China for similar activities could get death sentences from the People 's courts .
