From Dearborn , Mich , last week sounded the opening horn of the 1956 auto season . Ford Motor Co. ' s Lincoln Division parted the curtains on two new models called the Premiere and Capri . In both looks and engineering , they represent a thorough redesign of previous Lincolns . They also represent the beginning of an ambitious campaign . Starting with these two models . Lincoln hopes gradually to edge General Motors ' Cadillac from its position as the aristocrat of U.S. cars . <P> The new Lincolns are longer , lower and wider than the 1955 models , bear a family resemblance to this year 's Mercury Montclair . The engine is the most powerful Lincoln has ever built , and one of the most powerful ever put in a U.S. family car ( 285 h.p. v. 225 in the 1955 Lincoln , 270 in the Cadillac Eldorado . 275 in the Packard Caribbean , and 300 in Chrysler 's limited production " 300 " ) . Both Premiere and Capri have automatic transmission and power steering as standard equipment ; the Premiere adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's seat in any of four directions . Optional : power brakes , an air-conditioning unit . <P> Lincoln points with particular pride to the cars ' safety features . The " deep-dish " steering wheel and its spokes-all flexible - are shaped like a bowl , with the end of the steering post set deep inside . In a crash , the driver would hit the flexible rim instead of the rigid post . Other safety items : door latches designed so as not to spring open on impact , a glareless instrument panel , seat belts ( optional ) , a shatter-resistant rear-view mirror . <P> Lincoln is well aware that it will take many years to catch up with the Cadillac . Some 74,000 Cadillacs were registered in the first half of 1955 v. only 16,000 Lincolns . But Ford is ready to roll . Says Ben D. Mills , Ford vice president and Lincoln 's general manager : " We do n't intend to be in second place . "                   @ @
