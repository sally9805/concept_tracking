Last week , with appropriate regret , Army Secretary Robert Stevens accepted the resignation of John G. Adams as the Army 's counselor . A central figure in last year 's Army-McCarthy hearings , Adams resigned less than a month after Michigan 's Republican Senator Charles Potter announced that he was redoubling his efforts to get both Adams and Stevens out of the Pentagon . " I have not resigned , " replied Adams at the time , " do not expect to resign , and have not been asked to resign . " <P> Adams ' departure left just two of the principal performers in last year 's hearings still in Government service : Stevens and Joe McCarthy . " A few more resignations should be tendered and accepted , " snorted McCarthy , when he heard the news of Adams ' departure . Other comings and goings in Washington last week : <P> The Senate approved the nomination of Kentucky 's able ex-Senator John Sherman Cooper to be Ambassador to India and Nepal . <P> The President nominated Philip W. Bonsai , 51 , a veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown , 37 , New Hampshire publisher and onetime secretary to Sherman Adams , to be Wage-Hour Administrator . <P> Trevor Gardner , 39 , brilliant , onetime boy wizard of the West Coast engineering and electronics industry ( e.g. , rockets ) was nominated Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for the second time in six months . The first nomination of Gardner , a close friend of J. Robert Oppenheimer. was blocked in the Senate by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper . After studying Gardner 's case , Hickenlooper announced last week that he would not again oppose the nomination .
