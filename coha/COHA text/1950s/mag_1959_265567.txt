NIGHTCLUBS In Her Fashion <P> Singer Lisa Kirk has spent 15 years becoming so skilled a pro that it is impossible for audiences to be anti . Gowned in clinging , strapless , white organza studded with sequins , perched atop a suitcase carried by four male dancers , auburn-haired Singer Kirk was spending her evenings last week being carried about the floor , belting out I 'm Sitting on Top of the World at the top of her iron lungs . It was corny , it was stagy , and few entertainers could have got away with it . But at the plush Persian Room of Manhattan 's Hotel Plaza , Lisa was getting away with it well enough to pack the house twice a night . Supplied with special material by Writer-Husband Bob Wells ( a co-producer of Dinah Shore 's TV show last season ) , Lisa presents the most elaborate nightclub act since Mae West lost Mickey Hargitay and his bar bells to Jayne Mansfield . <P> In a sense . Lisa has been preparing that act ever since she sang her way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan 's old Versailles club . Rodgers &; Hammerstein spotted her there , signed her for Allegro ( 1947 ) , outfitted her with a show-stopping song , The Gentleman Is a Dope . In Cole Porter 's Kiss Me Kate ( 1949 ) , she raised double-entendre to a fine art , singing I 'm Always True to You , Darling , in My Fashion . Since then , she has concentrated on elegant watering holes in New York , Chicago , Los Angeles . As she became perhaps the most velvety fixture in the velvet reaches of the posh supper clubs , she also helped set a trend toward acts with gimmicks . In her present carefully written show , Lisa does not take a shower on the dance floor ( as she managed to a couple of seasons ago ) , but she does just about everything else . <P> During 53 minutes , she somehow seems to use as many props as a juggler and wriggle through as many costume changes as Auntie Mame , comes out for the finale , Limehouse Blues , in an Oriental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything Goes ) and cool ( Why Ca n't You Behave ) , as well as specialty numbers , e.g. , Good Little Girls Go to Heaven ( " and smart little girls go to Bergdorf 's " ) . Her primary gifts are a voice with volume where she wants it and a figure to match . She can be sultry and sexy , playful and cute , lonely and sad , all without losing her cultivated air of stylishness . <P> Lisa is only 33 , and can presumably go on being sultry , cute and stylish for decades to come . But if she should ever lose her nightclub following , her energetic , silver-haired mother may point to new possibilities ; at 66 , Mrs. Kirk is a successful model impersonating happy , middle-aged matrons of the Serutan set .
