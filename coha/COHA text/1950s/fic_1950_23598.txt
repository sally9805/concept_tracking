The Beautiful MO A Story by George Howe Drawings by Arthur Mctrokvia T HE American lieutenant and his French bride disappeared for their honeymoon . Mme. Bertin stayed over a day at the ch  --  teau to round up some country food for her Paris apartment . In the city , she said , one chose between hunger and shame . One had to wait hours in line for rations or suffer the degradation of the black market . Indeed , some of the delicacies at our breakfast for the cortege could not be found there at all  --  where in Paris , for instance , was there a live turkey , or even a dead one ? What she needed was poultry , eggs , a bottle or two of wine , and perhaps a rabbit . We pointed out that the daily train from Dijon back to Paris was crowded even for the empty-handed , even in the compartments of the RTC , for Americans were shipping homeward as thick as the rails and the ports could take us . She might not get on at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she carried her spoils too . But she was willing to take the chance . There was still much white bread left over from the wedding ration , and many tins of Spam , tomatoes , corn , and navy beans . We were closing up so soon that we could not eat them all before the deadline . M. Couteau , the cook , loaded our trade goods in the front seat of my Jeep . He had created a wedding feast for forty , as good as before the war , by swapping with the farms . It would be simple to barter food for one more lady . He and Mine . Bertin  --  she in her wedding hat of doves and white blossoms  --  perched in back , and I drove out the gate toward the farmsteads where he thought we might do business . Wherever he saw chickens in a barnyard , or even heard them from the lanes , wherever a rabbit twitched its nose from a hutch , he stopped me . The two traders went inside , bearing a few cans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening through the grape arbors to the pourparlers that opened their traffic , to the hesitations , the shocked refusals , the pained regrets , the grudging but inevitable consents , the parting gaieties . The housewife would wave the traders from her door with an " an plaisir , " hugging her box of Spam . Mme. Bertin would trip daintily through the manure , and M. Couteau would follow with a trussed rooster , his =winking eyes hard in a useless vigilance , his wings aflap , his beak parted in dumb terrified outrage . The stock was not large , and we expected to receive even less than we offered . But the negotiation was so stately that it lasted through the afternoon . M. Couteau was bargaining at his shrewdest for our guest , perhaps thinking of his war's-end pourboire . The last visit was the longest of all . I was tired of waiting in the unyielding jeep . Three fowl which Couteau had tied to the right strap-ring pecked moodily at my ankle . Even the mild rabbit nibbled my OD sock , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a lettuce leaf and did n't even look like one . At four o'clock there was just one loaf of bread left in our carton . Down the lane clattered a man in sabots : a man of forty-odd , his clothes dusted with brownish flour . He touched the brim of his flop hat . " Monsieur , permit me to present myself . I am the baker of Orville , which is the next town , and formerly , when there was gasoline , I had connections in Lux , where I know Monsieur is stationed . In your carriage I see a white bread . Since before the war I have not eaten white bread , or even baked it for others . At my small house down this road I have eight hens , who lay the largest eggs in Burgundy . " Would Monsieur think of taking a dozen of these fine eggs against the single bread ? He will excuse my boldness ; I speak , as it were , professionally . " My friends , I told him , would consider the exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , would urge it on them , unless they were at this moment buying more eggs than would survive the trip to Paris . His face clouded , and he looked long at the golden crust of the quartermaster 's loaf , and the white flour which dusted its folds . " Perhaps Monsieur thinks I do not offer enough . There are , alas , only the twelve eggs in my poulailler , but I repeat they are the best . Possibly if I added some produce from my garden , let us say a few onions . . . " " You have n't any old chests , perhaps , " I suggested . " For the bread , your eggs would be more than generous . The chest would not be for Madame 's voyage to Paris at all , but for my own house in America , which has burned down with all its chests . " " That , no . " He shook his head . " I have only my wife 's wedding chest . But Mme. Brulet , who lives two doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kings  --  solid walnut , not veneered . Perhaps she would sell it to you . It is fantastic how she loves the Americans  --  as we all do , " he added hastily , " but she to a point ! When we have stopped at my house for the eggs , I shall conduct you to Mme. Brulet . " Mme. Bertin and M. Couteau came out with another rabbit , and sure enough a dozen eggs . Even though they needed no more " In French villages , the houses shoulder one another just as in the cities . " eggs , they agreed that a baker had a special claim on the remaining loaf of bread . Mme. Bertin presented it to him with a smile . Let him keep his eggs for his own family . No doubt they were the finest in Burgundy  --  had we not heard of them even in Lux ? If he would get Mme. Brulet to show us the chest , to reward the patience of Monsieur the driver , that would be payment enough . 0 uR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mme. Brulet 's prim cottage . It was not like the narrow-sashed stone fronts that formed the commune of Orville . In French villages , though even the smallest proprietor has land enough for a few animals , the houses shoulder one another just as in the cities . Perhaps there is a tax on windows , as there used to be in England . Perhaps the citizens shun the sunlight ; the blind walls , the bolted shutters , the curtained sleeping-alcove make a refuge from the outdoors . Mme. Brulet 's house was different . It stood clear in its garden , behind a stone fence . It was plastered white . Its low roof had a cozy air of Cape Cod . A cat slept inside one of the wide windows , among begonias potted on the generous sill . Though the door was locked , a broom stood trustfully outside the jamb . The cat jumped off the sill as the baker knocked . " Eh , Madame Brulet , " he shouted . No one came . He put his finger to his temple . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would be at the river with her washing . If Madame and the Messieurs would wait ... " He turned the corner of the lane , still holding his loaf . A few minutes later the double clacking of sabots announced that he had found her . She rounded the corner with him , a smiling nett-aced little woman of sixty , patting her untidy gray hair with one hand and drying the other on her apron . " These are Americans , " he presented us , " but they speak well . " " Aha , Americans then ! " she laughed . " I have many friends in America . Even since the other war , the ones who requisitioned my house have not forgotten me . At New Year 's there is often a postcard , and before this war there used also to be a cake . Perhaps now there will be a cake again . Does Madame think it possible ? Tourism may resume , and my friend the sergeant may even return to Orville . But you shall see my poor house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , monsieur ; how sad ! It is what one needs most as furniture . " From under her black apron she fished a six-inch iron key , tied by a chain to her waist . She opened the wide low door . " What part of America does the sergeant live in ? " I asked her . " Ah , you ask me about your own vast country . I do not know whether it is among the redskins or the skyscrapers . Only that it seems to be a little village , perhaps like Orville . It is called MO . The postcard says always that it is beautiful . The beautiful MO , he always writes at the top , as one writes la belle France . I have one postcard still . " She rooted in a kitchen drawer and brought out the picture of the main street in a mid-western town . It was dated in 1928 , from La Belle , Mo . " Mei is in neither , madame , " I told her . " It is rather in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , as Orville is at the center - of France . " She led us through the shining kitchen to her own bedroom . " There is my chest , " she said proudly . " It was my grandmother 's dowry , together with the bed and the wardrobe . She was married in 1832 . I am a grandmother now myself . My grandson Rene is eighteen . His mother died when he was born . I have brought him up . He is a good boy . He fought in the Resistance , even when the Germans were in this very town . They tried to make me say where he was hidden , but I would not tell . Luckily it was at night they came to search , for in the daytime I hid him myself  --  guess where  --  in this very wardrobe ! " She threw open the doors of the tall cupboard as if she unveiled a statue . We half expected to find him inside , but the wardrobe was empty . " For two weeks , " she laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before your army drove them out last fall . We could tell in Orville that the Germans were frightened . They warned us they would blow up the bridge at six the next morning . My great-grandfather had been chief mason for that bridge , in the time of the kings . There was a fat German guard at this end , who took the papers of all who wished to cross , though it was a small bridge , and at the other side is nothing but the rest of Orville . He had a little car , not unlike la Jeep . Early that morning , while it was still dark , Rene poured sand into that car , he emptied the gasoline , he punctured the tires with his knife . Ah , you should have seen the guard when he found itI He could n't get it across the bridge in time . We could hear your guns coming closer . " I looked out this window . The Germans blew up the bridge , and even the laundry-house which was beneath it , so now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . But they had to leave their car , and Rene , who had captured it , gave it for a present to your captain when the Americans came into Orville that afternoon . How we laughed ! He is imprudent , that one , but so brave . " I have promised him the wardrobe when I die . With the bed and the chest , it makes a whole set , as you see . But if Monsieur desires the chest alone , he shall have it , since he knows the beautiful MO . If not , there is my friend , M. Rouget , across the river . He has a chest too  --  of an antiquity ! ? which perhaps he might yield . You could at least ask him as my friend . He is at home all day , for he is very old . " " Madame is too generous , " I answered . " Rene should have all three for his own wedding . Besides , the chest , while very beautiful , is not of the epoch which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Rouget , and if I go to MO , I promise I shall tell your friends what a brave grandson you have . " She locked the door behind us , but when she saw the jeep she shook her head . " Monsieur , I am an old woman . I have never ridden la Jeep . Perhaps I should have dared in the other war , but you did not have her then . M. Rouget is in the first house after the grocery , on the left . You need not fear to cross the planks of the bridge ; a truck went over them yesterday . Your engineers have made them solid , until our masons can finish the stone . Rene himself is a mason . Besides , my sheets are lying on the bank . I shall go back to my washing . " " Nobody will take them in the few minutes we shall be gone . " " No , but there are the cows who might eat them . However , if you would be happier , I shall try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that it was no longer an engine of war . The baker and I helped her up to the front seat , where she had to fit her sabots carefully between the rabbits and the roosters . Her cloak enfolded the flock as a hen herself enfolds her chicks . Mme. Bertin and the baker had to follow on foot . We bumped across the Bailey bridge . The river below gushed over the limestone debris of the ancient arch . Mme. Brulet gazed anxiously at her spread of linen on the bank , but no cows were near . A ROUGET lived in a stone lean-to which slanted its narrow roof against an- , other house . His three shutters were closed . Mme. Brulet pounded on the door , as we had on hers . She listened at the keyhole . There was no answer from inside . Heads appeared at the windows of the next house . " He is perhaps asleep ; it is his hour , " someone called . " Try the back door , Madame Brulet . " She put a finger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sabots. she tiptoed through the side gate , knocked softly at the back door , listened for a moment , pushed it open , and went into the blackness beyond . In a moment she was back in the sunlight , shouting at us . " Come in , come in , the Americans . M. Rouget finds himself at home . " Mme. Bertin and I followed her into a room ten feet square . We could feel a dirt floor under our feet , and hear the ticking of a tall clock . We made out a great brass bed , littered with torn feedbags and gray quilting . M. Rouget laboriously unhinged himself from repose . He was bent as sharp as a jackknife , so bent that his rag-edged white beard hung clear of his open-throated nightgown . " He is ninety , " Mme. Brulet shouted proudly , as if she authenticated an antique , and loud enough for him to hear her praise . " It is an American , " she bawled at him . " He has come for your chest . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtingly , but pushed aside a potato-sack portiere and led us into his other room . We were used to the darkness now . An empty iron pot lay among the ashes of the fireplace . On the opposite wall stood an oak chest with the rounded panels and the waved apron of the provinces under Louis XV . It was black with age and dirt . Mme. Brulet looked at me in a kind of anxiety , for I think she would have had to force her own on me if I had not wanted his . I nodded my satisfaction . " It , also , is beautiful , " I told her . " Almost as beautiful as yours . ' Whatever Monsieur thinks is right I shall be happy to pay , if you will speak for me . " Still voiceless , and apparently unhearing , M. Rouget took a poker from the fireplace , hooked it into the keyhole and pulled open the top drawer . The chest had been built without handles , to be opened only by a key  --  a key , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist of some thrifty housewife dead these two centuries . " M. Rouget forgets much , " Mme. Brulet sighed . " He has no wife , so he has lost his key . But a new one could be made . " In the first drawer were a few broken pieces of glass , a yard of string , and half a dozen nails . Half the thin board of the bottom had fallen away . Through the gap he pushed open the second drawer . It was empty except for a coil of flat steel tape . half rusted through . He held the tape between his fingers , looking at each of us in turn , round-and rheumy-eyed , questioning us . We shook our heads ; no one knew what it was . At last he spoke , looking at the smoky ceiling : " For hoop skirts . It stretched them out . " His voice seemed to rise from far away . It broke to a chuckle , then sank to a sigh . He set the coil back in the same corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be used again while we live . " Mme. Brulet dropped her own voice , but in spite of his deafness he seemed to hear her , and some glance of comprehension passed between them . He had to hold the poker end-up to open the bottom drawer , which was the biggest . Half a bushel of potatoes rolled to the front as the drawer creaked forward . " Potatoes , " he announced , and straightened back to a right angle . " Monsieur would like to have your chest for his charming wife , " Mme. Brulet began . " She lives near the beautiful MO , and her own chests have perished in an incendie . At what price the chest , Monsieur Rouget ? " M. Rouget only stared in front of him , perhaps searching for some plot behind the absurd request to buy his broken chest . I offered him a Camel . He broke it open and poured the tobacco into a pipe which he fished from the pocket of his nightgown , It did not fill the bowl . He reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my potatoes ? " he rumbled . " Ah , voikt ! But if the Americans should find you a chest with handles , a solid one , would that not go better ? " " Better still , " I offered , " I could perhaps find one with a small drawer at the top , where you could place the hoop-skirt ribbon , the pipe , a little tobacco . " " Ha , " he broke in , " tobacco , then ! " " And below it doors , with a shelf . Thus the potatoes could rest on the shelf , without bruising , and you would not have to stoop for them . Even perhaps some shelves above , for other things . If I do not find one , shall pay M. Bahoff the carpenter to make one as M. Rouget may desire it , and to paint it as well . " Mine . Brulet smiled , and said to me in our stage whisper , " One sees that the men are good housekeepers in MO . Would that not be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one ? " He shrugged his consent . " You see ? " she turned to me ; " he is de-lighted with the exchange . " Her voice rose again . " Monsieur will bring his truck tomorrow , if he can find your new chest today . You will not forget , eh , Monsieur Rouget ? " Again the shrug , this time the shoulders even lower , the arms limp , and the hands spread flat at his side . " Tomorrow if you can , " she urged me , " because it is alas true that by the day after he will forget . " M. Rouget opened the front door for us . He stood blinking in the sun , his bare feet and blue-veined ankles balancing his crooked body on the earthen floor , his nightgown higher behind than in front . We shook hands , and he started to creak the door shut . " Ah , but an obstacle , " he croaked , suddenly voluble , " un ' p  --  chement ! " He let his hands fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day . It is easy to drop potatoes into the drawer , no matter how many I grow , but I do not support much stooping to lift them out . " " That 's easy , " laughed Mme. Bertin , like the lady from Philadelphia enlightening a Pinkerton . " Let the purchaser move the potatoes . " " It is seldom in Orville , " Mme. Brulet added , " that one has an American army to move potatoes . " T U:KILY M. Bahoff had a fine new dresser in his shop , with shelves above and below . It had not been painted . We loaded it on the weapons carrier next morning . We picked up Mme. Brulet at her cottage  --  overnight she had lost all fear of la Jeep  --  and drew up at M. Rouget 's . He had not forgotten . His shutters were open . He was dressed in a ceremonial suit of rusty black . The swallowtails stuck out flat behind . M. Bahoff and I unloaded the new dresser , filled it with the potatoes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rouget groaned " So little money , and so little time ! " from time to time , I saw he was glad of his bargain , and so was I. Mme. Brulet had brought her broom , with which she took the unique occasion to sweep the floor before the new dresser was set in place . I had brought a kilo of Prince Albert from the PX . It was more than palsy that shook M. Rouget 's hand when I gave it to him . By now , Mme. Brulet was sweeping his bedroom . " What color shall M. Bahoff paint the new chest ? " I shouted at him . " Eh , paint ? He need not paint it . I shall paint it myself , why not ? I am not yet too old , " and he smiled for the first time . Mme. Brulet leaned on her broom like a victor on his spear . " Is he satisfied , do you think ? " I asked in our stage whisper . She nodded . " Perfectly . And if you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget it in his life . " So little money , and so little time ! I tendered M. Rouget the note . He looked sharply at it . He rubbed it between his teeth and squinted at the light through the watermark . He put it in the drawer of his new dresser , slipping the bright key in his pocket . We shook hands for the last time . " I 'm going back to bed , " he sighed . " Au plaisir , monsieur , and my best wishes to our friends at MO . "
