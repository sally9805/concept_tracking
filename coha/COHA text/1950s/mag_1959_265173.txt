By day and by night , over the nation 's great steel centers from Sparrow 's Point to Fontana , the belching smoke and cherry glow of the furnaces made dramatic testimony to steel 's comeback . The order books were filled for months ahead , and the mills were pouring at near-record rates . The figure last week : 86% of the industry 's newly expanded capacity , 2,439,000 actual tons and a volume within hollering distance of the 2,525,000-ton alltime peak set in December 1956 . As customers hurried to build up depleted inventories and hedge against the threat of a strike or higher prices in July , some mills even began to ration short products on an informal basis . Steelmen expect the big demand to run through the second quarter at least , make it the biggest in steel 's history . <P> The industry still had some slack left , but it was not enough to feel really comfortable , and steelmen were thinking of expanding once again . National Steel Corp . Chairman George Magoffm Humphrey and President Thomas E. Millsop announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant since U.S. Steel Corp . put up the $500 million Fairless Works ( TIME , Dec. 22 , 1952 ) . <P> Costing at least $150 million , the 2,200-man plant will rise on 750 acres of sand dunes along Indiana 's Lake Michigan shore , will wedge National into the big-league Chicago market . It will process steel from National 's Great Lakes Steel Corp . in Detroit , where National will add 500,000 tons of capacity , boost its total to 7,500,000 tons , only 500,000 tons behind fourth-ranking Jones &; Laughlin . Counting further expansion at Steubenville , Ohio and Weirton , W. Va. , National will spend $300 million through 1961 . <P> The jump in steel came largely from the pickup in autos . Sales of 128,000 new cars in February 's first ten days rode ahead of the year-ago pace , and production last week climbed 36% above a year ago . The continuing production pickup pushed freight carloadings more than 6% above last year 's level , the fifth straight weekly rise . Total industrial production in January moved up for the ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four points below the all time peak of December 1956 . Personal income was also up by $2.4 billion to a record $362.3 billion , and spurred buying . In mid-February , department stores rang up 8% more sales than last year . <P> Despite the rising demand , the consumer price index inched up only one-tenth of 1% in January , to 123.8% of the 1947-49 average , still below the peaks of last July and November . The price index has ridden on a plateau for the past nine months , the longest period of price stability since the U.S. started to compile monthly figures in 1935.
