Fallout <P> Sir : <P> Since the bomb tests on Christmas Island are nearer to our shores than Japan 's , why are n't we protesting to the British ? <P> <P> MRS . MARVIN N. NELSON Provo , Utah <P> Sir : <P> Your June 3 summary of the bomb tests is an excellent example of concise reporting of a complex subject . One of the larger pitfalls involved in the fallout problem is that of assuming that science and research will take care of the matter in good time . As a member of the scientific fraternity , I should say that although we have done little to dispel the idea that researchers can invariably come up with the right thing at the right time , this is far from true ; scientific methods are reasonably above reproach , but those who use them are subject to human shortcomings . The simple principles by which we have so far lived are now inadequate . The difficulties of formulating new principles might be neatly resolved by a Second Coming , but rather than wait for that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . <P> <P> WESTON H. JENKINS Corning , N.Y <P> Sir : <P> I see a poignant tragedy of shortsightedness in the present discussion about fallout and the relative merits of clean versus dirty bombs , especially from the point of view of a shock hydrodynamicist . War has always been a stupid , nasty and insane business , at best , and the present orders of magnitude on civilian targets lends little sense to the hypocrisy of trying to distinguish between useful and useless killing . <P> F B PORZEL Chicago <P> Sir : <P> More and more of us are getting the fallout blues as we become increasingly aware of the dangers : <P> Ashes to ashes , <P> Dust to dust . <P> If the Bomb does n't get you , <P> Radiation must <P> P.
