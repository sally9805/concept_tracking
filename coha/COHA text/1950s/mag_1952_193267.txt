The President seemed at his folksy best as he talked to his fellow Americans , via television and radio , from his White House desk . He tripped clumsily here &; there as he read his message , but mostly he exuded persuasive sincerity , pugnacious impatience with critics , and flat sentences full of importance for the nation . <P> Harry Truman wanted the people to get behind his $7.9 billion foreign aid program . He called it neither " foreign " nor " aid " ( two words without public appeal ) , but " mutual security . . . against aggression and war-through mutual effort , through the effort of many nations . . . " <P> Warned the President : " The action the Congress takes on that $7.9 billion request has a great deal to do with our chances of avoiding another world war . It may make the difference between life and death for many of you . . . " <P> Enthusiasm . Proposed U.S. " contributions " to other countries , explained Truman , fall into three categories : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion worth of " defense support , " i.e. , raw materials or finished goods needed to support the military effort . " For example , we might send steel to help another country make its own guns instead of sending it the finished weapons . " <P> $600 million worth of Point Four economic and technical assistance , mostly for underdeveloped Asia and Africa . <P> The Point Four funds were obviously closest to Harry Truman 's heart . " Stomach Communism , " he observed , " can not be halted with weapons of war ... It is only a fraction of the amount I have asked for military purposes , but who can say that in the long run it may not have a greater effect ? " With happy emphasis , he told his hearers some Point Four success stories-a $75,000 project for diesel-powered pumps in IndoChina 's Red River Valley that assured a $2,000,000 rice crop , the work of nine American experts in raising Turkey 's grain production by 50% and cotton production by 300% , the agricultural modernization being brought to 3,000,000 village farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual security proposals , Harry Truman shifted to an advance attack on the critics that he knew were waiting for him . " There are those among us , " said the President belligerently , " who say we ca n't afford it . We 've heard that one before . . . The figure of $7.9 billion . . . was not just taken out of the air ... I would not recommend that the Congress spend a single dollar more than our national security requires . " This , too , was typical Truman-at his worst . Actually , his estimates are - and have to be-very rough approximations of what is needed . Truman 's long feud with Congress is rubbed raw by the President 's open assumption that his estimates are exactly right and any others wrong . A humbler man would have outlined the problem , given his figure , stood ready to defend it in detail-and avoided tactless , advance insistence that every dollar he asked was essential . <P> " It is awfully easy to ' demagogue ' in favor of economy and against what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Truman . " Congressional action on our Mutual Security Program will be a real test of statesmanship . . . "
