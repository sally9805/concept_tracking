txt A fantastic story of the looting of the taxpayers ' money " by the scum of the u n d erworld " - under the very eyes of the army engineers  --  w a s laid before the senate today . The story was Johnson told in a report by the senate armed forces preparedness subcommittee , headed by Sen. Johnson D. , Tex. on the loading at Jersey City , N. J. , of equipment for the half billion dollar American air base program in French Morocco . Details were supplied in a supplementary report by two subcommittee investigators , Downey Rice and George Martin , both formerly of the legal staff of the Kefauver senate crime committee . $t50,000 Contract Awarded The story began with the award of a $150,000 contract to Dade Brothers , Inc. , on Jan. 19 , 1951 . Three days later the contract was doubled . By Dec. 31 , 1951 , the contract had expanded to approximately 9 million dollars . When the work began , the underworld moved in . The report said of the activities at Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry that employment at Claremont terminal was largely in the hands of ex-convicts and other persons with criminal records , apparently acting in concert with political officials . " Get New Contract The army engineers , the subcommittee found , had general supervision of the contract , but did not , as the coast guard does under similar circumstances , require workers to be fingerprinted so underworld figures could be eliminated . Two weeks after Rice and Martin submitted their report , the army engineers announced that the contract had been canceled . But after its contract was canceled , the company was invited by the army to bid on a contract for terminal services at Hampton Roads , Va. , and it got the contract . Drones on Payroll The subcommittee said labor union hiring bosses exercise the power of t ' economic life or death " over the longshoremen , by designating each day which ones shall be allowed to work , and added : " A further refinement . was practiced at Claremont terminal thru apparent liaison between the hiring bosses , who for the most part were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that arrangement , favored individuals are placed on the payroll but are not required to work . " Their sole function apparently was to collect their ' wages ' on pay day . " , The subcommittee took testimony from a police detective that unknown to the contractor and the union , which the committee said is the AFL International Longshoremen 's association , he counted the number of men working frequently in the first three months of last year . He found , according to the subcommittee that the daily count of workers , in most instances , Wall " considerably less than the ' numbers reilectea by the company payrolls . " Rice and Martin reported that the detective found a nightly average of 149 fewer men on the 400 man night shift alone than were supposed to be working . This , the investigators comput e d , would cost the taxpayers $50,000 a month . " Shortly after it became known locally that the subcommittee 's investigators were looking into the matter , " the report said , " the night shift at Claremont terminal was eliminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was lack of cargo . " However members of the night shift testified that on prior similar occasions all workers had been retained for considerable periods when there was nothing for them to do . " Rice and Martin reported finding that one payroller was a full time bartender many miles away in New York City . The report said : " The committee realizes that Dade brothers found themselves somewhat at the mercy of the racketeers . However , we certainly can not condone their apparent indifference to the practices which were the subject of ridicule by tip public and the press . ' Dade brothers can not plead ignorance of the facts , and the committee is forced to conclude that they knew of these conditions and the effect on the cost of operation . This applies especially to payroll padding . " Under the time and materials contract , Dade brothers were allowed a markup of up to 100 per cent of direct labor costs . Under such an arrangement it would be to the contractor 's monetary advantage to close his eyes to payroll padding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by the army engineers , was retained until the amount of the contracts reached 7 million dollars , and after the subcommittee had begun its inquiry . The committee said cost plus fixed fee contracts are customary . Million Dollars Lost The subcommittee said it is impossible to estimate the losses in payroll padding , but said 1 million dollars could have been saved on charges alone had the engineers ' corps used " due diligence . " Rice and Martin reported that George Dade , president of the company , had earnings of $6,500 in 1948 , $3,375 in 1949 , and nothing in 1950 . But in 1951 lithe first year of the Contract , the investi , gators said , Dade 's earnings skyrocketed to $52.200 . Reached at his home in Glen Cove , N. Y. , Dade said : " We apol , ogize to no one for the operation of Claremont terminal . " ? The investigators said that Robert Dade , vice president with no connection except his title , got a $10,000 bonus in 1951.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
