Canada 's 25th Brigade-8,000 men strong-went into action as a unit for the first time in Korea last week . It drove six miles into North Korea , captured a 1,500-ft. hill south of Chorwon , pulled back in orderly fashion through rain and mud when the Communists staged a fanatic counterattack . Said Major Dick Medland of Toronto : " We had excellent killing . " <P> The brigade 's commitment in Korea seems to have silenced permanently the complaints voiced in Washington and Lake Success last fall over Canada 's sedate slow-march to war . Said U.N . Secretary General Trygve Lie in Ottawa last week : " Considering its population and resources , Canada is now No. 2 among the United Nations in Korea . "
