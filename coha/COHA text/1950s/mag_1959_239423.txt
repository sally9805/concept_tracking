NEW YORK DAILY-NEWS : Morse has long hounded , harassed and blackguarded Mrs. Luce from his libel-suit-proof position in the U.S. Senate . We hope the Senator is satisfied . It will be interesting to learn , though , whether Morse 's Oregon constituents enjoy seeing a yahoo bully a lady . <P> BOSTON HERALD : Senator Morse , who has won this dubious victory over the Lady Ambassador , now qualifies , in our opinion , as the true heir of the late Senator McCarthy . <P> DENVER POST : The attacks of Senator Morse had some of the flavor of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy in his unsuccessful drive to block the appointment of Charles Bohlen as Ambassador to Russia six years ago . As it did in the censure of Senator McCarthy , the Senate may have need once again to look at its own behavior . <P> DETROIT NEWS : Mrs. Luce is perhaps too much a compulsive wit to be the ideal diplomat . She has trouble keeping separate the many things she is and dimming her own radiance enough to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noncareer diplomats we 've had , a woman of the world , who in no sense but the Pickwickian is an " ugly American . " <P> Brazil 's DIARIO DA NOITE : Certain leftist groups , especially Communists , are against Mrs. Luce . They can not tolerate the energy with which she has fought Marxism . <P> Rio de Janeiro 's JORNAL DO BRASIL : Senhora Luce can be certain that the U.S. Senate debate did not in the least affect the Brazilian concept and appreciation of her personally . The predominant opinion , now that we will not have her here with us , is deep disappointment . Brazil 's role in Pan-American development would have been ably treated by a diplomat with the extraordinary abilities and superior intelligence of Senhora Luce . <P> DALLAS MORNING NEWS : While Mrs. Luce 's acid remark about the Senator after her confirmation by his colleagues was far from tactful , she was a much abused lady . Her reaction , if not diplomatic , was democratic . The sound in the offing is doubtless her fellow Americans crying " Hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luce should have allowed her anger to renew the row after it had been settled in her favor is difficult to understand.We happen to be one of Mrs. Luce 's admirers . She did a fine job as American Ambassador to Italy . She is one of the nation 's most able women . But we think she was wise to resign . <P> CHICAGO SUN-TIMES : The lesson of the entire affair seems plain : when Senators seek to carry out personal vendettas against presidential appointees under the guise of improving the diplomatic service , they take the risk of damaging America 's diplomatic service . <P> CHICAGO DAILY NEWS : We do not agree at all that Mrs. Luce committed some offense against the dignity of the U.S. by talking back to the blabbermouth who had been attacking her . <P> CHICAGO AMERICAN : The resignation of Clare Boothe Luce as Ambassador to Brazil will have no effect on the welfare of the U.S. There had been no popular demand for her-return to public life , and it will not be difficult to find a substitute for Senator Wayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Morse objects-to anyone criticizing him , but he is free to criticize everyone . Wayne Morse , ex-Republican , now Democrat , can dish it out with a shovel , but he can not take it with a teaspoon.
