The leading lady was almost dumb with stage fright . On opening night in Philadelphia , her lines faded into half-heard whispers , and the audience squirmed with shared embarrassment . Then a voice rasped down from the cheap seats : " Speak up , Ethel . You Drews is all good actors . " <P> The advice was fine , but results were slow . In the early winter of 1901 , while Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines limped toward Broadway , 21-year-old Ethel Barrymore was sick with fear . And she suffered doubly because she had been born to the stage . Her father , Maurice Barrymore , was a matinee idol . Her actress mother , Georgiana Drew Barrymore , and her uncle , John Drew , two of the topflight actors of the day , could trace their lineage back to the strolling players of Elizabethan England . Anxious not to disgrace the family , Ethel asked herself over and over again : " Why am I doing this ? " <P> One month later , Ethel had her answer . Her rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a hit . Long lines of ticket buyers curled across Herald Square from the box office of the Garrick Theater on Manhattan 's 35th Street . Her name went up in lights on the marquee , and for more than half a century the glow remained . Styles changed : Broadway brightened ( and cheapened ) from gaslight into the Great White Way , and moved north to Times Square ; nickelodeons grew into movie houses ; the talkies came , driving the " legit " theater into retreat , and the ghostly black-and-white flicker of TV in turn haunted the movies . But wherever actors worked at their trade , Ethel Barrymore ruled . <P> Wonderful Time . Her brothers , John and Lionel , also honored the family onstage . But even John , whose liquid offstage escapades lent gaudy luster to a theatrical generation , recognized amber-eyed Ethel as queen . With her , both boys were always chastened-properly formal and respectful . " My God ! " exclaimed a friend after attending a typical family dinner . " Do n't you know each other ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to all ages . Her elders admired her art ; her pre-World War I contemporaries copied her manner of speech , the way she walked , even the proud tilt of her head .. She belonged not to Broadway or to Hollywood , but to the country . For Ethel Barrymore became a star in an era when no star stayed put . A few months in Manhattan were always followed by tours to other cities-and all were equally important . <P> Even before she became a star , Ethel was a trouper . She knew what it was to make one-night stands in Main Street theaters , to sneak out of cheap hotels with the family luggage left behind in locked , unpaid-for rooms . She knew what it was to live in hall bedrooms that cost $9 a week , meals included . " It was a wonderful time to begin seeing America , " said she , " just at the beginning of the changes that were to be so tremendous . " For her , one-night stands were always good-in Jackson , or Little Rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so was the audience " ) .
