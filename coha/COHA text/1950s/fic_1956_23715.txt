A Story by EATON G. DAVIS Drawings by Joseph Escourido I T WAS cold  --  suddenly and unreasonably cold for Connecticut  --  fifteen below , and nobody was dressed for it . The day-shift was just coming out as Dennison approached the factory gates . Most of their cars were frozen , and as Dennison found out later , it was three hours before some of them got home that night . Dennison had always felt sorry for the day shift because they spent their lives in darkness , like the dwarfs who used to work for Thor and Odin . It was still dark at 6:55 A.m. when they came to work , and dark again at 7:00 P.m. when they got out , eyes and fingers still twitching with the rhythm of the machines . Then nothing to do but go home and eat and sleep , in the dark . And then get up and go to work again , in the dark . The factory was well designed , with windows arranged to let in the most light possible , but it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even on bright days the light could never penetrate to the interior of the plant . No one , except the traveling-crane operators , had ever seen the ceiling . The two-hundred-watt bulbs were burning all day long ; and the impression was that of being underground . The night-shifters led a different life , and they themselves were of a different race from the day men . They were younger , unsteady in their habits , and socially impossible . They were amateurs . High-school boys , most of them , natural mechanics , who had learned to operate and repair farm machinery when they were children . They were of many nationalities , including both East and American Indian , all waiting to come of age to be drafted . There was also a sprinkling of ex-automobile salesmen whose activities had been put a stop to by the war . Although these were comparatively elderly men , thirty years old or more , not used to working with their hands , they were quick to master the intricate ritual of machine operation . They brought an artistic conscience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an innovation which did not endear them to the old professionals on the day-shift . The man who ran the gear-cutting machine next to Dennison 's was one of these . He was a Polish Jew , with a name so lacking in Western vowels , and of such length , that he had decided to change it to a simple Henry Simons . He was a scholar , a connoisseur of music , and had a knowledge of Semitic folklore and history which seemed to he limitless . During the long hours required to cut one of the main gears for the big turret-lathes which were the only product of the factory at the time , Henry would keep everybody alert by telling stories of Gilgamesh , the Semitic hero , whose exploits were so like those of Hercules that some students have concluded that they were the same person . Henry was tickled by this theory . Hercules was to him a sort of Johnny-come-lately , about like Jack Dempsey . THERE was a special sense of hearing to be acquired in order to maintain normal relationships in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get abraded away , as if by a dentist . There was one sound which affected not only the ears , but the whole body . It was made by the housings of the turret-lathes ( hollow shells of cast iron , nine feet high and four feet in diameter ) being cut down to size on the horizontal turning-lathes which had been built for that purpose . The resonance of such a shell is about that of one of the larger Buddhist gongs , and when a heavy steel cutting-tool is biting into it as it revolves on a spindle , the scream that comes out is like the sound made by a giant with broken fingernails , scratching a blackboard . This , combined with the steady clack of the gear-cutters , the noise as of thousands of fish being split produced by the broaching machines , and the roar of the traveling-cranes , is at first impact an unbeatable obstacle , blocking thought and speech . After a week or two the sounds blend into a whole which is far away , somewhere up near the invisible ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous explosion are able in some way to separate themselves from it , to run under it , although the sound they make is not human . It is the sound of another machine . Dennison lifted his gear blank and put it carefully ' on the spindle . It weighed a hundred and fifty pounds and so did he , but he could handle it easily . There is a knack . He secured it , firm on the spindle , and adjusted his machine , 144 teeth , fi pitch , 2 hours and 40 minutes . Time to smoke and talk , always keeping an ear cocked and an eye ready for any change in the rhythm of the machine . The main gears were costly , and although machine operators were hard to come by in the early days of the war , a man who scrapped one of them was likely to be fired , or at least watched . Being watched in an atmosphere of nervous tension which was already almost past endurance was not something to look forward to . Henry Simons did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a nasty little thing with tiny teeth which required a special , and irreplaceable , tungsten steel cutting-tool . He was concerned about it . He was not afraid of dismissal . Every cent of his pay , which was quite serious money what with the bonus and the overtime , went into war bonds . He had tried his best to get into the armed forces in some capacity or other , but since he had bad eyesight , asthma , and flat feet , they had politely told him to go do some war work . He was working a twelve-hour shift in a factory as MAGAZINE a penance for being a crock . He did n't want to break that tool because be admired it as a work of art , which it was . At the same time he was angry at having been given such an assignment . A younger man should have had it . Henry had to stop his machine , take off the little gear , clean it , test it , put on another one , and start the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his easy task of the big gears , wanted to_the have conversation on topics of general interest , such as love , music , and the Russian front , but Henry would have none of it . His feet hurt and he hated the smell of the cutting-oil which had to be kept constantly running over his little gears in order to prevent that priceless tool from overheating . The stuff is vegetable oil , and as if that were n't bad enough , it is used again and again , running into an open tank by the side of the machine , from which it is pumped to the top and started down . After a month of this the stench is almost tangible . Henry knew that his hands would be soaked in it all night , that it would inevitably go from his hands to his trousers and from there to his shirt , so that by morning he would be saturated . He would have to go to a Turkish bath , where he kept a change of clothes for these emergencies . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't bear to go in unless he was clean . To anyone who has ever smelled that oil , this is not so eccentric as it seems . He was in a real temper , and consequently kept making scrap , which cut down on his bonus . All in all , it was a bad night for Henry , slipping and slithering on the greasy floor-boards . The night , like the Good Soldier Schweik , kept right on keeping on . Dennison had finished three of his big handsome gears  --  eight hours and eighteen minutes , allowing six minutes apiece for changing and testing . A soft job . Eighteen minutes actual work in eight hours . But unwavering vigilance is work too , though Dennison did n't realize it . He had no one to talk to , and the terrible shrieking whine of the iron housings was beginning to get to him , though he did n't realize that either . He had considered changing jobs with Henry for a while , but decided that Henry would never permit it because of spite and rivalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn not only more money , but the bitter hatred of the day-shift . He was n't making it this night . His hands were beginning to shake , and Dennison knew from experience that behind his oil-smeared glasses his eyes were filming over . He was n't securing his gears properly , and time after time a piece would be hurled into a scrap box . A man forty-three years old , tall , but very frail , with a weak chest  --  he should not have had the job . Three hours to go . Dennison fidgeted and opened his fourth pack of cigarettes . D I R E C T L Y across the aisle was a man named McArdle , who operated a machine which made helical gears . On these the teeth are not cut straight across the face of the blank , but spirally , like stripes on a barber 's pole . The machine which makes these is necessarily complicated , and the mentality of the operator must match it . Therefore McArdle , intelligent , experienced , and high-strung to the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been brought up in a machine shop . Although only thirty-two , he.had spent seventeen years at the machines , beg-inning at part-time jobs when he was still in industrial high school . He could operate and repair any kind of machinery , whether or not he had ever seen it before . He was even a skilled toolmaker for his age , and intended , after he had retired from plant management at the age of sixty , to follow that remarkable and little-known profession . He treasured the lesson of one of his teachers in industrial high school , a toolmaker . " It goes like this , " the old gentleman had said . " First you read everything you can find about the old clock-makers , annorers , goldsmiths . Lookat pictures of what they did . After that , study mathematics through plane trigonometry . Then enough physics and chemistry to give you some notion of the properties and composition of metals , and what heat and pressure can do to them . And then , " the old man had said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn to use a file . " McArdle 's exterior did not agree with all this . Face and body together made a composition of rocky promontories , durable but not threatening . He stopped his machine , took off the work , and held it up to admire it , sparkling clean and beautiful in the artificial glare . It was a helical gear in the shape of a truncated cone , and a really good piece of abstract sculpture . Like the spear of a narwhal , thought McArdle , or the shell of a turreted snail . He put it revel-ently in the clean box reserved for finished pieces . The cleanliness was no doing of his . It was caused by the cooling agent used for his kind of work , which was not an oil at all , but a thin white liquid smelling of chalk . It cleaned everything it could reach , including McArdle himself and even the floor around his machine for a distance of several feet . His fingers were pink and puckered , and his clothes were wet but thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was way beyond his quota . He decided to take it easy for an hour . Being an experienced professional , one of the few on the night-shift , he knew that his quota would be adjusted if he worked too hard . This would discommode him financially and increase the strain on his nerves . A peculiar system . He took a cigarette from his waterproof case and started vaguely oft in the direction of the washroom . Halfway across the aisle he was heavily bumped into by Henry Simons . Henry was in a pitiable condition . He had probably caught cold on his way to work , and his asthma was getting serious . Dennison had tried to take the job away from him , without effect . No , Henry had said , you 'll break the tool , and I will be held responsible . Then for God 's sake shut down the machine and go home , Dennison had said . You 're dying , man . But Henry would not . Therefore it was with something of relief that Dennison saw the collision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind . There was . Henry let out a blast of Yiddish invective that burned Dennison 's ears , though he understood no word of it . Then Henry , wheezing and desperate , swung the filthy cloth that he was supposed to wipe his gears with , and slapped McArdle full across the eyes . McArdle was the only man there who had not been affected by the pandemonium of the factory . It was his natural habitat . But he was Irish , he was always at the highest pitch of tension , and above all he was a powerful young man who had been kept at the irritating task of running a delicate machine just a little bit too long . He picked Henry up by one of the straps of his suspenders , and began pounding him up and down on the floor . " Henry , " he said , " you 're a greasy little Polack , " and continued pounding . Dennison knew that McArdle had meant no insult by this wholly accurate statement . He was just letting off steam . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit McArdle as hard as he could on the cheekbone . McArdle was enchanted . He put Henry gently aside and went after Dennison . It was really no contest . Dennison was strong for his weight , but so was McArdle , and there was a difference of some sixty pounds . He banged Dennison around a bit , and then , annoyed and bored by a cut he had received on the bridge of his nose , caught him a nice Ieft hook under the ribs which lifted him off hisfeet and slammed him against the back of Henry 's machine . Dennison slid to the floor , dazed and bruised , but by no means out of action . His head cleared in a few seconds , and he sprang up to see McArdle shaking Henry up and down the way a bartender shakes a cocktail . Quickly , but with deliberation , he picked up his heavy machinist 's hammer . He wrapped the head of it carefully in one of his cleaning rags , and struck McArdle smartly between the shoulder-blades . This blow , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . Dennison had done it just right . Not too hard . It brought McArdle to his proper senses . He dropped Henry and turned to face Dennison . " What the hell , " he said , and began to grope in the muck for Henry 's glasses , which had fallen off . He found them and took them to the lavatory , where he cleaned them thoroughly . He came back and handed them to Dennison , and then picked up Henry as a mother would her baby , took him to the lavatory , and washed him as best he could . Dennison had shut down Henry 's machine and taken off the Iast gear , which of course was no good , and thrown it in the scrap box . McArdle came back , guiding a much restored Henry by the elbow . Dennison went and swiped a bench from the grinding bay , and the three of them sat down , for the first time that night , and smoked . on his jacket and went out to twenty below , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a mason jar half full of home . made applejack . This he drank in long thirsty gulps , never taking it away from his mouth . Feeling better , he went to Marco 's and had a hot pork sandwich and a bottle of ale . By the time he got home the sun was up . He took a shower and climbed into bed , happy to see the blessed sunshine spilling in the window . As he was snuggling his sore shoulders into the covers , he laughed aloud . " Battle fatigue , " he said , and went to sleep
