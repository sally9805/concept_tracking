For 20 years nuclear physicists have used neutrinos ( small , uncharged particles ) in their calculations . Neutrinos are necessary : without them many nuclear equations would not balance , and the massive branches of nuclear theory might fall to the ground . But no known apparatus has ever detected neutrinos . They were reasoned into existence by Nobel Prizewinners Enrico Fermi and Wolfgang Pauli to fill a theoretical need , and the gnawing suspicion has long persisted that they do not exist . Last week from the Atomic Energy Commission came big news . Neutrinos do exist . <P> Detecting neutrinos with ordinary instruments is like catching bats with a steam shovel . Since they carry no electric charge and are vanishingly small , they pay little attention to matter . The average neutrino can probably pass through billions or trillions of miles of dense material without being stopped by it . Neutrons do , however , " interact " slightly with protons ; so there is a very small chance that if a great many neutrinos pass through a material rich in protons , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be detected . <P> Monstrous Assembly . Several years ago Drs . Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan Jr. , physicists of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory , armed themselves with AEC money and went hunting neutrinos . Their first attempts , with a monstrous assembly of special apparatus , were inconclusive ( TIME , May 10 , 1954 ) . They thought they detected neutrinos streaming out of the AEC 's great reactors at Hanford , Wash. , but they were not sure . So they returned to Los Alamos and constructed an even more monstrous apparatus . <P> The theory of neutrinos predicts that when one hits a proton ( an infrequent event ) , a positron ( positive electron ) is emitted , and the proton turns into a neutron . Both new particles are unstable . The positron hits an electron , and both are " annihilated , " turning into gamma rays . The neutron is absorbed by almost any kind of matter , and if a little cadmium is around , the neutrons captured by it give another burst of energy . <P> 330 Eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 1,000 gallons of liquids ( water and hydrocarbons ) that are rich in protons . The water contains dissolved cadmium to capture neutrons , and the hydrocarbons give scintillations of light when gamma rays pass through them . The scintillations are recorded by 330 photomultiplier tubes that watch the scintillating liquid like large , unblinking eyes. * <P> Best hunting ground for neutrinos is near nuclear reactors , from which , by the Fermi-Pauli theory , they stream in vast numbers . So Reines and Cowan took their apparatus to the AEC 's Savannah River plant . They set it up in an underground room where it was sheltered from distracting cosmic rays but exposed to a flood of neutrinos from one of the great plutonium-producing reactors .
