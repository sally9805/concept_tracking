 | THE look of thick palings , like a gate , pointed at the top and higher than her head , swung on its hinges . Someone , then , had unlocked it ; the wind had blown it open . She thought only and swiftly of the handyman , coming to the terrace , unlocking the gate , leaving it unlocked . She went through it along the narrow ledge , sharply conscious of the deep black abyss directly below . Lightning flared and showed her some empty flats for flowers , stacked against the fence , and a flight of steps leading up to the roof . She called the cat and her voice was carried away by the tumult of slashing rain and wind . Lightning came again . The flight of steps was solidly fastened against the wall of the apartment building , going up to what seemed , against that brilliantly lighted sky , to be a flat roof with an opening , for the steps , in a low coping . There would be chimneys there , of course , ventilators huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suddenly perfectly sure that the cat had gone to the roof . Scurrying , terrified , lost in all that wild black strangeness . Well , she had to find him . The rain had plastered her hair down against her face . She brushed it back , and suddenly , out of the past , remembered Simpson as a kitten . His pointed black face , his vehement blue eyes wild with the excitement of a red ribbon , strung with tinkling little bells , and tied around his neck . She could see the kitten , a glimmering Christmas tree , her mother , the lighted room of some distant childhood Christmas . She had found the slippery cold railing . She had started up the  | narrow iron steps with the rain slathering down upon her face , when she thought : this is silly . This is stupid . I ought not to be here . This is dangerous ! She clung to the wet , cold railing ; she lifted her face , trying to tee through rain and darkness ; there was another vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the roof above . Something moved there , against the lighted sky . The lightning was gone ; thunder crashed over the city , all around her . There was only blackness above , below  --  everywhere . What had moved up there ? had anything moved  --  like a head , aware of her approach , jerking backward as the flash of lightning revealed it ? If anything moved , it was the cat ; and it was not the cat . So then , there was nothing . A shadow flung wildly by the lightning . But what was she doing here , alone , in the wild darkness above the sleeping city ? The cat had more sense . He 'd have found shelter . She turned and held to the railing ; in the darkness , when she reached the terrace again , she felt for the wall of the apartment house and followed it back , touching the kitchen windows , closed , touching the paling gate , still open . Light fell pallidly upon the wide , front terrace ; she ran along it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wiped her eyes and face and pushed back the wet strands of her hair . Simpson was sitting before the fireplace looking at her . " Well , " she said breathlessly , " well . " She turned around , her coat and dressing gown dripping , red slippers sodden , her hands wet and shining , and closed the French doors  --  shutting out the night . She bolted the doors . No one was watching her , of course ; no strange white face loomed against the night , but she pulled the curtains across the doors with a sharp swish . In the morning , only to reassure herself , she determined to see that the paling gate was locked , and to tell the handyman to be sure to keep it locked . The curtains shut out the storm . She looked at the cat again and he was washing his face , hard and earnestly as if he 'd been  | eating , as he could n't have been . She 'd go back to sleep and forget the storm . She hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her dressing gown , her clinging , wet nightgown , and dried herself and her hair hurriedly with a thick towel . In the light and-ordinariness of the shiny little bathroom , she was able to laugh at herself . She 'd been really a fool to venture out into the storm , more than a fool even to start to the roof . How easy it would have been to step accidentally over some low and unperceived coping ; how absurdly easy it had been for her to conjure up a substance from a shadow  --  a faceless fear from nothing at all ! Simpson was more sensible . She got a fresh nightgown . And , again touched with the notion that the wild , black night around her made a shield for observation , she pulled the bedroom curtains together , and again scoffed at her own impulse . Did she really feel that anybody could scale that height , could ascend like a huge black bat to the ledge and peer at her ! Simpson came into the room ; his coat was wet and disarranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had returned to the apartment , probably with the first heavy sweep of rain . It was then , however , only a little after eleven . It was a long time before she went back to sleep . She got a book from the small library ( crowded too with its red , leather-covered chairs and sofas ) , and did n't read . She found cigarettes , and lighted one and put it out . She listened to the storm . Gradually , toward morning it died away . It was about nine when she awoke . The day was overcast with heavy , dull gray mist hanging over the towers . Going through the foyer on her way to the kitchen she discovered that she had left all the lights blazing everywhere ; they looked garish in the dreary gray light of day . In the kitchen she glanced out at the terrace ; it was shining and wet . The empty flats were drenched ; little streams of water and red soil were seeping from them . By leaning over the table , she could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight of narrow , solid steps going solidly and openly up  | to a roof that was , too , veiled in mist , but only a roof with a black line of coping unbroken by any shape or shadow . She was about to draw back when she saw on the bottom step , a rather curious abject . It was small , brightly colored , extremely familiar but oddly irrelevant , for it was a can of salmon , opened , with the jagged round of its top drawn up . Well , what of it ! Someone had left it there by accident  --  the handyman who picked up the waste boxes  --  anybody . It had nothing to do with her . It was , she thought again , irrelevant . But quickly then , as if the word were quicksilver swiftly gathering in its own spilled beads , other small irrelevancies strung themselves together . A smoking cigarette with no one to smoke it ; a scribbled scratch pad in a closed , fastidiously neat , scrupulously orderly room ; a cat washing its face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom step . She moved away from the window ; she went to the cupboard where she 'd placed the cans of salmon she 'd ordered the afternoon before . How many had she ordered ? Of course the grocery store might have made a mistake in the number they sent . Then , she thought sharply , that 's a silly thing to do . Why should I count them  --  to prove that nobody entered this apartment last night ? To prove that nobody took a can of salmon and opened it , and then set the can on that lower step ? Why does such a thing enter my mind ? Why . . . ? The telephone , the extension , rang stridently and demandingly , almost in her ear . She answered it and a woman 's voice said : " Mrs. Brooke ? Mrs. Fenwick Brooke ? " " Yes  --  yes ... " " This is Western Union . We have a cable for you . " " Will you read it , please . " The name  --  the address  --  the signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . .. : ' " It reads : Arrived last night from Zurich too late . If agreeable you and Fen will make funeral arrangements here . Please advise . Urgent you see Warner immediately . Love . Laura Brooke . ' "  | Out of it , at first , Maggy plucked only one word . That was " Warner " ? Russell Warner , the Brooke family lawyer . The kitchen was gray and silent . The terrace glistened bleakly outside . Maggy heard her own voice saying slowly with harsh distinctness : " Will you repeat that please . . . ? " She listened ; she thanked the voice at the other end of the wire politely ; she put down the receiver . There was some mistake . The message was not for her . It did n't mean what it seemed to mean . She went back , through the dining room , into the lighted living room . She sat down near the telephone , near the lovely Sheraton table and polished the corner of it with her hand ; there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that she had come to the table in order to telephone  --  to Fen  --  to Bill  --  someone . She took down the receiver expecting Fen 's voice , but a girl 's voice said impersonally : " Mr. Warner wishes to speak to Mrs. Brooke . " Warner , Russell Warner  --  she remembered him very well . He had often come to the house to dine with Charles Brooke during the war years when she had acted as hostess . She could see his round , pink face below a shining , bald head ; his shrewd , hazel brown eyes . " This is Mrs. Brooke .... " Russell Warner 's voice came on . It sounded hurried and businesslike . She did not realize it was the effect of strain until she had put down the telephone again ; Russell Warner was shocked , too . " Maggy ? Maggy , I want to see you . " " I 've just heard . Is it true ? It ca n't be . .. . There was a note of perplexity in his voice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he 'd told you Charles was dying . Well , never mind that now . Is Fen there ? " " No . " " I 'll get hold of him , too . I 'd better  --  Maggy , Bell , Charles ' secretary , you know , says you know all about Charles ' will . "  | It was true , then . Russell Warner said sharply : " Did you hear me ? This will of hales ' , this new will ... " She heard him and did not hear him . Charles Brooke could n't have gone , like that , so swiftly , so finally , with all the things she 'd have wanted to say to him forever , now , unsaid . " Maggy , I ca n't hear you . Maggyl " " Yes . Yes , I 'm here . " " Are you all right ? You sound  --  I 'd better come up and see you . " " Yes . " " I 'll be there in a few minutes . " The telephone clicked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock to him , too . I 'd better get dressed . I must talk to Fen .  | FEN was not at the city apartment ; he was not at the country house . She tried both telephones ; the voice that answered at the apartment was that of a man on duty at the switchboard ; he said merely that Mr. Brooke was out ; no one answered when she got through to the country place , but that meant only that old Lawtie was out on the grounds somewhere and not where he could hear the telephone which rang also in his cottage . She gave up and started to dress ; the pale-gray shantung dress , the first thing her hands found , she had worn last to lunch with Charles Brooke in London at the Savoy . He had ordered a clear light claret ; he had complimented the dress with its tight basque-like top and long slim skirt and the frothy white lace at the collar ; he had introduced her , with pride she 'd thought , warmed and pleased by that pride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : his daughter , Mrs. Fenwick Brooke . Her eyes felt dry and hot ; she was brushing her hair into its smooth , burnished cap when the doorbell rang . She ran to the door and opened it . " Fen ! " He put his arms around her . " You 've heard ? " " Yes . . . Oh , Fen . . . " Fen 's sense of loss would be crueler , deeper than her own . The last moment of decision , the moment in which to remake their marriage . Then she realized that Fen was very still ; so quiet that it was as if Fen himself had departed , gone swiftly over a faraway path , taken some distant journey where she could not follow him ; she  | had no road to guide her , no knowledge of paths and direction . She moved to look up into his face and he was looking over her head , staring at the wall beyond . She said : " Fen  --  Fen . . . " She Imost said : where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his eyes lost their blankness and re completely natural . " I was thinking about him . " If only in life there were signboards , pointing out the way , inicating that this  --  now  --  was the turn to take , this extended hand be grasped , this decision to be made ! Then the moment had passed ; she had delayed too long . The buzzer at the door beside them was pressed by a firm , hurried hand , peremptorily . Fen went to open the door . Russell Warner , his face pink and shining , his eyes bright and anxious , came quickly in . " Fen , you here ! Good . And Maggy , my dear child . I 'm so sorry . " Ile took her hand briefly and then put out his hand to Fen . " You 've heard then . I tried to reach you by phone . It 's a shock . I am sorry , Fen . I wish there had been time for you to see him . Apparently there was no time at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura got there but she was too late to see him . I 've been on the phone . " Fen said : " What happened , sir ? I had only the cable .... " Russell Warner shot him a quick glance and another one at Maggy ; his eyebrows drew together . He had a round cherubic face which nevertheless could look severe and powerful . " Pneumonia . It was very quick , mercifully , I suppose . But  --  a shock . When did you see him , Maggy ? " It seemed a long time ago . " Day before yesterday . Only the clay before yesterday . " Fen said : " How did he seem then ? Were there any indications of this ? " " He was n't well . But I did n't think of anything like this . He was tired .... " Russell Warner said : " Apparently he called the doctor that afternoon , the day you left , Maggy . They put him to bed . He would n't let them tell anyone , he was sure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that there was n't time to get any of  | you there . Bell , the secretary fellow , seems to have been afraid to take things into his own hands as he ought to have done . He did send for Laura . But by then it was too late . Charles ' heart was n't too strong ; I knew that . He was conscious up to the last though . Still sure he 'd get well . That was like Charles , too . " Fen moved nearer her again , he put his arm around her and said : " You 'd better have something , Maggy . Brandy ... " Russell Warner glanced vaguely around . " I 'd like some coffee myself . " Fen said : " I 'll make some coffee . " He started toward the kitchen . Maggy followed him ; Russell Warner put down his hat and trotted after them , his breath quick and short . The homeliness of the kitchen , the accustomed little habit of domesticity was like a tie binding her and Fen together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks of their marriage they had made early coffee together , hurriedly , watching the clock . " I 'll get my breakfast at the commissary , " Fen would say , snatching his blouse , buttoning it swiftly . But it had happened a long time ago to two other people . Not to her , not to Fen . Russell Warner settled himself gravely on a high kitchen stool . " When did you hear ? " he asked Fen . Fen bent to adjust the blue points of the gas flame . " Not till this morning . " Russell Warner got out a handkerchief and rubbed his bald head with it . " He died in the night , about three o'clock . That 's London time , of course . About ten our time , no , about eleven , daylight saving . Laura got there an hour afterward . Too bad . The only member of the family they could reach . She flew from Switzerland . " Fen turned the gas flame higher and then carefully a little lower . " They tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd driven out to the country place for the night . When I got back this morning I found the phone message but the cable was already here . It was signed by Bell . ... " " He 's the man I talked to . Laura was resting when they finally  | got through to me by phone . " Warner wiped his head again . " Whole thing seems to have been hurried and confused . The connection was n't very clear . I was shocked  --  shocked .... " Fen said : " I did n't know his heart was like that . " " Nobody knew . This secretary fellow suspected . Charles always rove himself too hard . " Russell Warner sighed and stared at the floor ; a small amber bubble shot upward in the glass top of the coffee pot . " When did you hear , Maggy ? " " Laura cabled . " The exact words were like a photograph existing in her mind . " She said : Arrived early this morning from %urich too late . Making funeral arrangements here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funeral arrangements ! There ? What did she mean ? " " Oh , I can tell you that , " Russell Warner said . " It was one of the things I wanted to talk to you about , Fen . I 'm glad you 're here . ' ' lucre are several things . . . " His voice drifted off ; he mopped his head and recalled himself . " Yes , well , the funeral . Laura was devoted to Charles , of course , and she seems to feel that it might be as well to have services there . Charles had many friends in London . And then when she returns , to bring the  --  to bring him brick . That is , if you want it done that way . Services later , here , and the family lot . It seems a prolonged way of doing it . Yet ? it 's practical , of course . But it 's up to you , Fen , to decide . Whatever you and Maggy think best . And unless you and Maggy want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It 's so unexpected . I ca n't seem to believe it yet . I suppose the point is , what he 'd have wanted . " " Charles , " the lawyer said abruptly , " would n't have cared . Bell 's an efficient sort of man . Seemed to have quite a sound grasp of business details . Was that all the cable said , Maggy ? " " She said : Making funeral arrangements here . Will keep you advised . Urgent you see Warner immediately . ' Then she said : ' Love ' and signed it , Laura Brooke . ' That was all . " That was all , and the mysterious tide of life had changed , swerved , and would never be quite the same again .  | Russell Warner , eyeing her kindly , said : " It was quick , Maggy . It was the way he 'd have wanted it . " Fen said , frowning : " I expect the cable was sent after they 'd talked to you , Russell , so you could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " Something like a troubled question wavered over the lawyer 's face , like the ripples on a still pool . " How 's the coffee ? Let 's take it some place where we can sit down and .. . You see , there 're some  --  some unexpected things we 've got to talk about . If what Bell tells me is right , and of course it is , " said the lawyer . He slid off the stool and shook down his trousers ' legs , went over to the white , shining breadbox and rolled back the lid . " Here are some rolls . " He peered in the box and looked at Maggy . " We 'll all feel better when we 've eaten . " Fen found and got out a tray . Again the small accustomed domesticity of setting out rolls and butter , and orange juice , cream and sugar , and cups reminded Maggy of the early days of their marriage . It occurred to her briefly that such memories went back , always , to those first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Fen had returned . She turned out the gas and put the coffee on the tray . Russell Warner held the swinging door wide for Fen to precede them , carrying the tray . He went into the dining room . This time the mirror reflected a shadowy procession ? Fen first , with the tray and glimmer of dishes , herself next , a figure in gray with a flash of white at her throat , a gleam of golden brown from her hair , Russell Warner trotting after them , his head sunk , his thin , light coat hanging limply from shoulders that looked stooped and tired , the white handkerchief dangling in one hand . They went on into the living room and Fen set the tray on a table . He went to open the French doors , and Maggy saw then that a small table , across the room , behind an armchair was turned over , an ash tray and three photographs in frames , and a small Psyche in bronze , spilled on the floor . She went automatically to right the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had turned over during the night , blown over by the storm , rousing her . She had n't seen it the night before when she 'd hurried through the room ; she had n't even looked for  | it or for something like it . She picked up the little bronze figure , unexpectedly heavy , and replaced it ; picked up the ash tray and photographs and was struck with the incongruity of her own gestures . How could such small things engage her attention now , such unimportant things ! Did it happen to everyone ? Was it a reminder , that ability to observe the trivial familiar things of daily living , that that daily living automatically went on , with the same concerns , the same routine no matter what happened ? Fen came back from the open doorway . The traffic sounds were louder . A damp current of air crept into the room . Russell Warner sat down and sighed . " I 'd better tell you exactly what Bell said . You 'll both want to know ; it concerns you both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His voice was different , worried and perplexed . Fen said after a second : " What do you mean , sir ? " " I 'll give it to you straight as Bell told me . I 'm glad you 're here , Fen . It concerns you really more than anyone else . Even Maggy . " Again a kind of immobility seemed to fix itself upon Fen ; cven his eyes were very still . He waited ; Maggy waited . A car hooted sharply away below them . Russell Warner said : " You see , Charles made a new will . He made it yesterday . Oh , it 's all right ? perfectly legal ; he was conscious right up to the last . But the will . . . " He got up , went to Fen and put a pudgy pink hand on Fen 's rigid shoulder . " I 'm sorry , my boy . But he  --  he 's left everything to Maggy . Except for an annuity , a small one , I have to say , to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes stared down unblinking Inito the lawyer 's face . After what seemed a long time , Maggy thought : that 's what Russell said over the phone . Yes , I remember now , he said something about a new will . Fen 's hand moved absently toward his pocket . He drew out a package of cigarettes and absently , as if he did n't know what he was doing , dropped it back into his pocket again . He said then , quietly : " That 's all right . Whatever he did was all right , you know . It was his money . It  --  that 's all right . "  | The lawyer 's pink face warmed ; he patted Fen 's shoulder briefly . " You 're a good son , Fen . Your father would like the way you 've taken this . The old will , the one he 'd made years ago after your mother died , left everything to you . Naturally . I never thought that  --  well , I 'm afraid this new one is the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , if you 'd  --  been different . Maggy , of course , " he said as an afterthought , " knew about it . Can I have some coffee now , my dear ? " He said " my dear " ; his voice was friendly , sympathetic , but there was something shrewd and cold in his eyes as he looked at her .  | IT WAS that coldness , really , that roused Maggy to an astounded understanding . Even then , she had poured coffee for all of them , mechanically , moved the little silver cream jug and sugar nearer the lawyer , before she really took in the meaning of it and cried : " But I did n't know ! I did n't know anything about a will . We talked about money . He said that I ... " She faltered a little . " He wanted me to control our allowance , Fen 's and mine , for awhile . But it was only for a little while . It was a temporary thing . Only until he could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't anything about a will .. . . Russell Warner said : " Bell said that you told him you understood it perfectly . " " Bell ? Bell ! But I ... " " When he talked to you yesterday . " " Talked to  --  me ! " He nodded . " Yesterday , he said . " " But he . . . " Bewilderment had crept into the room insidiously and stubbornly with the gray morning . " He did n't talk to me ! " The lawyer stirred sugar in his coffee . " He said he talked to you . Charles could n't talk . He got Bell to do it for him  --  told Bell what to say . Told him to explain about the will . " Russell Warner tasted the coffee . Maggy stared at him incredulously . The lawyer lowered the cup and added : " I gather he would n't let Bell say how very sick he was . But still . . . " He gave a faint shrug . Maggy rose . " But Bell did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sick until I got the cable . Nobody phoned to me from London . Bell  --  nobody ... " Russell Warner 's scant eyebrows lifted . Maggy took a step forward , a warm wave flooding up into her face , and Fen said suddenly : " Look here , sir , if Maggy says she did n't talk to him , she did n't . " There was a little pause . Russell Warner stirred his coffee , and after a moment said : " Bell made a mistake then . It does n't matter , really . We can get him by phone later . Poor Laura . . . " he sighed . " I 'm glad Bell seems able to see to things . " The sharp cross-light was on Fen 's face again , making it subtly different , older , fine drawn ; he moved and was the same . He said with his usual frankness : " Do n't worry about this new will , Maggy . You could n't have helped it . " " It 'll all iron out anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you two get back together again . That 's what Charles wanted , of course . Well , I 'd better go along if there 's nothing I can do for you , Maggy . " He rose and spoke to Fen and his face warmed again . " I 'm proud of you , Fen . Your father would be . I know , he 's told me , some of the  --  the causes for disagreement between him and you , but all that 's in the past . You were very young when you went into the army . Maggy will certainly be able to see that . You need your wife now , in your sorrow , and you need her to help you make a fresh start . " He stopped , thought for an instant and added , with a kind of stubborn deliberation : " This is , in my experience , a very unusual thing . As I understand it from Bell  --  we talked quickly of course , and I was indescribably shocked to hear of Charles ' death ; consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as I understood it , the estate is left entirely to Maggy . She can do as she pleases with it . " " Then that 's Maggy 's business , " Fen said . " It 's not my place as a lawyer to express a personal opinion . But as a friend , Charles had no right to do this . " He looked at Maggy with a touch of compunction . " I 'm sorry , Maggy . You loved  | Charles and he loved you . And of course I realize that Charles expected a reconciliation between you and Fen . " Fen said : " She 's been with him so much . He thought of her almost as he would his own daughter . " Maggy said stiffly : " I do n't want the money . I do n't .. Fen put his arm around her . " We 'll not talk about it . But Russell did n't mean anything he seemed to mean . You 've not been working on Father all this time to get him to change his will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you lived at home ! That 's nonsense ! " " I did n't say that ! " Russell Warner snapped , suddenly impatient . " What I meant to say , as Charles ' friend and yours , is that I hope you two will get together again . That 's what Charles wanted . And it 's the only way to square the thing . I 'm your friend too , Maggy , but  --  well , that 's the way I feel about it ! " Fen put an apologetic hand on the lawyer 's arm . " Give us a little time ! " " I know , I know . " Compunction again came into the lawyer 's tone . " Remember it 's a grief to me too , Fen . Well , I 'll go on to my office . I 'll be there in case . . . " He put his hand on Fen 's shoulder again . " You 're a good son , Fen . I wish Charles could know . " " Thank you , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had n't known him at his sincere , friendliest best , she would never have seen the slight difference in his manner when he turned to her . " Phone me if you want anything . I 'll let you know when I know any news . " The lawyer took a breath , seemed to consider and reject further speech and , pink and worried , wiping his forehead , went away . For a moment , Maggy stood quite still ; then Fen put his arm lightly around her . " It 's all right , Maggy . " " Fen , I knew nothing of this ... . " " It 's all right . " He moved away from her , got cigarettes from his pocket and lighted one , stood for a moment staring at it , and then lifted his head ; his eyes were blue and clear , and candid .  | " Do n't let Russell upset you . Of course , you did n't plan and scheme for this . Remember , he 's a lawyer and , as a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far as I 'm concerned , Father was right . I 'm not to be trusted with money . At least I have n't been up to now . And in any case , whatever he did was right . " " Fen , I ca n't take any money ! I knew nothing of it . What we talked of was only a temporary sort of arrangement . Nothing like this . I 'll not take it ! It 's yours , just as soon as I can make them see it ! Just as soon as I can . . . " What did one do , actually ? What were the mechanics of disposing of property one did n't want and had no right to have ? He was shaking his head . " I 'm a little hazy about law , but I do n't think it 's as easy as that . But , in any case " ? he reached for his cup of coffee ? " I 'll not take it. - He wanted you to have it . " " Fen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so obvious that she wondered why they had n't seen it at once . " Fen , he did n't think he was going to die ! He did n't really mean me to have all this ! He ... " " Let 's not talk about it now . The money  --  that 's not what we really care about . " " Except it was wrong , Fen . Russell was right when he said it ought not to have been willed away from you ... " " It 's still in the family , " Fen said , and then laughed shortly . His blue eyes flashed at her and back at the cup he held . " No , I 'm wrong . I forgot . This changes things , does n't it ? I ca n't make love to you now . I ca n't try to get my wife back again . You 'll think it 's money . " She thought again : is this the moment ? Is this the time ? Shall I put out my hands to him , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; tell him I 'm still his wife and we 'll go home together , back to the big white house above the gracious avenue of maples ? She did n't move ; something she could not control held her in cobweb bonds , so soft she could not even identify their real substance . Fen put down his cup and went to the mantel so he could lean  | upon it with one elbow and look down at her . " There 's one thing I want , Maggy , more than anything . That 's for you to trust me and believe me .... " " I do trust you , Fen . I do believe you . " For an instant again , he seemed to go away , along that invisible road , while his body remained there , his eyes blue and still . Then he came back . " All right , darling , all right . Now then , what about this plan of Laura 's ? ' What do you think of it ? " It wrenched her back to the incredible fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't matter . " " I suppose so . I 'll talk to Laura . " " Fen , I wish  --  if I could only make it easier for you . " He smiled down at her . " I know , Maggy . We both loved him . " He started toward the foyer ; she rose to go with him . At the door , he said : " Everything all right ? Have you got a cook yet ? " " I 'll get somebody today . " " Right . I 'll let you know anything I find out after I talk to Laura . I 'll be at the apartment if you want me . " I-le kissed her briefly ; the door closed and the emptiness of the apartment fell upon her like a shadow . Charles had said : " Do n't stay alone . " After a long time , remembering that , she got her thick little address book and tried Winifred , who was away , and then Sylvia Hunter who was quickly sympathetic and efficient . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Mr. Brooke . I 'll see about servants . Leave it to me . I 'll be along as soon as I can get there . " Maggy put down the telephone feeling rather cheered by Sylvia 's brisk and pleasant voice . But an hour or so later when Bill came , she was still sitting by the telephone staring outward at the blank , opaque sky beyond those bright green leaves . When she opened the door at his ring , he gave her one look and took her in his arms . " Fen rang me up and told me . I ca n't believe it  --  Uncle Charlie Without intending to , she put her aims up around him . " Maggy  --  Maggy  --  there now . . . " He patted her head ; he  | patted her shoulder gently and rather clumsily ; he got a handkerchief . " If I could only have talked to him . .. . " I know , I know , dear . Do n't . . . " All the things I wanted to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a part of it . People always feel like that . " " Bill . . " Here , turn your face . " He wiped at her wet face , as he 'd have wiped the tear-stained cheeks of a child . " It 's all right . Cry all you want to . You 'll have to , you know ... . Suddenly the thing he had told her the day before seemed to repeat itself , wordlessly , in a silence between them . She looked up at him , and he was looking at her . For an instant a kind of question , very urgent , very important seemed to hover in the air between them . But if it was a question there was an immediate answer to it . Maggy started to draw away from him and at the same instant Bill said : " Better ? " and let his arms drop away from her . " It 's one of those things , Maggy . Part of being an adult . Part of life , I guess . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might never have said the things he had said . Yet subtly , like the shifting of shadow and sun upon a meadow , the whole plane of their relationship had taken on deeper colors , new values , a changed perspective . There was no denying that ; but she still , even more urgently , must not accept that change . The telephone was ringing . It had been ringing , she realized then . Bill said : " Want to answer that ? " He put his hand up to brush her hair back from her forehead . " You 're all right . Come on to the telephone . " He went with her into the living room . She took up the telephone and Fen 's voice sounded excited . " Maggy ? Maggy , listen ! The damnedest thing . I do n't understand it . I 've talked to Henry Bell and he says  --  can you hear me , Maggy ? " " Yes ... "  | " He says he did call you yesterday from London ! He says he talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , he did n't . . . " " He says he told you about Father 's will . He says he told you Father was sick . He says you told him you 'd let me know . Maggy , did you hear me ? "  | SOMEONE , " she said , " was in the apartment . " She had n't intended to say that ; it was like a rope thrown at random across a chasm which unexpectedly holds . " What ? " Fen said . " What ? " Once she had said it , it seemed to take on authority . " Someone was here , Fen . Somebody had to be here . I did n't talk to Bell . " " But you  --  Maggy , how could . . . ? " " There was a cigarette . " " What ? " " It was still burning . In an ash tray . " " Maggy , what on earth ? " " When I got here . Yesterday afternoon . It was still burning . " But would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , think that taking a message like that was a lark ? Besides it had to have been a woman 's voice ; even allowing for a bad connection , Henry Bell 's nervous excitement , anything , it still had to have been a woman 's voice ! Not an elevator boy ! " Listen , Maggy . I ca n't understand . When was this ? " " It must have been between four and five ; about half-past four . I came in  --  I 'd just come in . Bill was with me ; he left . I smelled smoke and came into the living room . And the cigarette was still burning . " She glanced at Bill who was listening , his eyes rather startled and puzzled . He said : " For God 's sake , Maggy . Nobody was here ! " " Then Bill must have left it , " said Fen in the telephone . " No , he did n't ; he 's here now . It was n't your cigarette , was it , Bill ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up with the bags , either . He went straight out . I heard him . Look here , let me talk to Fen . " She gave him the receiver . " Fen , no , this is the first I knew of it . I suppose that 's it , of course . An elevator boy  --  left when he heard us come in . It 's nothing for Maggy to be worried about . Okay . " He looked at Maggy . " He wants to know if there was a handyman or anybody around . " She took the receiver again . " Nobody was here then . I looked . I looked all over the apartinent and the terrace , and ... " " But , Maggy , how could . . . ? " " 1 do n't know , Fen . " Suddenly it seemed illogical , impossible ; the rope for the chasm frayed and hung by a thread . No elevator boy would have answered that telephone , talked across miles and miles of space to Henry Bell in London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem reasonable to think anybody would talk to Bell . Or pretend to be me . " " Bell was excited ; maybe there was some confusion about the connection . That 's it ; he got a wrong number and whoever answered did n't know what it was all about  --  some maid somewhere , that 's it . . " Somebody was here . " " Well , it 's queer . It  --  but Bell could n't hear distinctly , that 's all . However , you 'd better speak to somebody , the superintendent . You ca n't have that sort of thing going on . The point is , Bell was wrong . He thought he talked to you and he did n't . That 's all . Laura was resting . I would n't let him call her . I could see Laura 's point of view ; she really is sensible . So I finally said their plan was best . Is that all right with you , Maggy ? " " Yes . " " Are you all right ? I 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling . " She put clown the telephone and , as she had done the day before , stared down for a moment at the telephone , at the desk , at a scratch pad with Laura 's initials , gay , in red block letters across it ? a perfectly clean scratch pad .  | She must have made some startled motion ; she must have said something . As she picked up the scratch pad , Bill asked sharply : " What 's wrong ? " " That  --  the top sheet had pencil marks on it . I did n't tear it off ! It was there . .. . His brown hand took the scratch pad firmly away from her . " Nobody 's been here ! Nobody could have taken it . I saw it .... " And again a bright , swift string of beads lined itself in order , irrelevancies , one after the other . Except of course if someone had sat there , smoking , if that someone , inconceivably , purposely , had answered the telephone , talked to Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idly on the scratch pad , then that someone might have removed it later . Yet only Fen and Russell Warner had been in the room ; and she 'd been there , too , all the time . Neither of them had approached the desk ; neither of them could possibly have taken that small top sheet without her knowledge . The point was , of course , that neither of them would have taken it . Bill 's eyes were intent . " Tell me , Maggy . What 's worrying you ? " She told him quickly . She did not tell him of her search of the terrace in the rain and the nebulous shadow ; that was unreal , a matter of frightened , feminine imagination . He already knew of the cigarette ; but the top leaf of a scratch pad was another small , hard fact . Bill listened , tapping a cigarette on the back of his hand , looking puzzled but not even faintly alarmed . " Well , " he said , " it 's queer , but there 's some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big lounge chair where someone had sat the day before , arm resting on a cushion . She told him that , too . His face tightened a little when he heard it . He rose . " Were the doors locked ? " " Oh , yes , on the inside . " " All the doors ? " " Oh , yes , except the terrace door . I mean the gate , out there , that leads to the back corridors . "  | " Hall door , too ? From the outside , I mean . Yes , I remember you had to unlock it . " Nevertheless he went to try the solid teakwood door , and slowly came back . " It opens easily , quietly . Locks itself on the corridor side when it closes . Anybody sitting here smoking could have gone that way , without being heard by either of us . Or somebody in the apartment house , errand boy or handyman , got the key in order to get out on the terrace . Yes . Were the French doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought for a moment , went to look at the French doors , went out on the terrace and presently came back . " If the French doors were bolted nobody could have got in here from the terrace , that 's sure . Maggy , perhaps you tore off the top sheet and forgot it . " She shook her head and looked at the memorandum pad ; he went to the table , lifted books , getting down on his knees to search below it . " It 's not here . " He got up , dusted his knees , and smiled at her reassuringly . " There 's some sensible explanation . But if it really upsets you , Maggy , I 'll stick with it till we 've got the answer . " He was puzzled , she could see , but more by her own uneasiness than by a scrap of paper , and that uneasiness was , mainly , due to her childish fear of the night and the storm and a shadow she was n't sure she had seen ! " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , frowning , trying to reconcile the trivial nature of the incident with the emphasis she had given it : " I do n't want you to worry about it . Does it in any way , well , frighten you ? " " No , of course not . No .. . He prowled around the room for a moment and said : " Look here , why do n't you go and stay with somebody ? " " Sylvia 's coming . " His head jerked toward her . " Sylvia Hunter ! Here ! " " Yes . I told you , I was thinking of asking her . " " I know . " His hands were in his pockets ; he was frowning a little again . " I remember . But I . . . " Why not , Bill ? " she asked , and remembered she had asked  | that before , laughing . " Bill , is there any reason ? When I spoke of her over the phone I thought you did n't like the idea somehow andI ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Nothing wrong with Sylvia . Nice girl . " Something in his face eluded her , yet his tone was perfectly natural . She stared at him for a moment and then a rather wild conjecture flashed into her mind . " Bill , can you mean  --  are Fen and Sylvia . . . ? " " Sylvia ! " A look of genuine astonishment came into his face . He laughed . " Sylvia 's not in love with Fen . If that 's what you mean ! Oh , Lord , no , Maggy , I did n't mean that . I  --  no , have her by all means . Much better than being here alone . When will she come  --  today ? " She nodded . He said : " I wish I did n't have to go back to the office . Oh , the hell with it . Look here , Maggy , have lunch with me . " But she knew too well how hard Bill worked and had worked . She shook her head . " Come around tonight if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'd like us to be together . " His face sobered . " I 'd like it , too , Maggy . I loved Uncle Charlie , too . " She went to the door with him ; he kissed her quietly on the cheek and went away and she stood for a moment before the blank , closed door , not seeing it . Bill who 'd said he loved her , who was no different and yet who , in some way , was different so their eyes could not meet without acknowledging , or with an effort avoiding , that difference . But then all of them were different  --  she and Fen and Bill ; they could never be quite the same , for Charles Brooke 's death had put a new maturity like a mantle upon them . It had brought too a heavy responsibility for her . Bill 's visit had , in a curious way , underlined and stated that responsibility . She could not avoid seeing it . If it was true about Charles Brooke 's will , then her responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fen , to Charles Brooke , was clear . If , yesterday , she had known instinctively that she could permit no word or look of Bill 's to find a lodging in her heart , then today  | that knowledge had reason . Her promise to Charles Brooke did not constitute solemn authority . The responsibility for Fen which he put upon her was inescapable . She saw that clearly , even then . It was about noon ; the day had become slowly , grudgingly lighter with the sky very quiet and the air heavy and humid . The brooding stillness everywhere seemed to add to the unnaturalness of the day ; in itself it suggested a kind of suspension of time and feeling . Activity , any sort of activity , ought to help . Maggy roused herself , moved about the apartment , went to wash her flushed face and swollen eyes , and to brush her disheveled hair . Simpson stretched and yawned , looking very old and frail with the gray hair edging downward into his once vivid black mask , his eyes faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat , stiff and weary . He showed no signs of stirring himself to further exploration , but she closed the bedroom door . Sooner or later , he 'd have to be permitted to acquaint himself thoroughly with the terrace , but not then . Perhaps it would be better to take him back to the country where Lawtie would see to him . She decided to get the place in order . She changed to a washable blue cotton dress ; there were not many clothes in the baggage she 'd brought with her ; she 'd have to tell Lawtie to send her trunks ill to the apartment . She would n't  --  not yet . She wondered if Lawtie knew of Charles Brooke 's death ; but , of course , he did know , Fen would have told him . She felt that t here were things that ought to be done , notes to be written , telegrams to be sent , people to see yet , of course , all that conventional sad routine was going on in London ; except , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be letters to write . She took off the dust sheets . The change brought color into the rooms ; the soft beige and moss green of velvet armchairs and sofas , the deep lovely red of a sofa leaped into the light . She polished graceful , beautiful , old mahogany tables and the delicate shapes of armchairs . She found linens and made up the bed for Sylvia in one of the two small , gay little guest rooms . She kept herself occupied ,  | or thought she did . Actually the entire day seemed strangely null , veiled and blank , like the sky . Sylvia arrived about five . She brought a cook , brown sacks of groceries , a number of large and elegant bags , and a new and extravagant perfume with her . " Darling , " she said , and took off her enormous , smart black hat and embraced Maggy . " Darling . " " Sylvia ! I 'm so glad to see you . " " I could n't come any sooner . It was getting a cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , you , Willie . . . " The cook was a small , agile Filipino with a round brown face and unfathomable , sloe black eyes . He bowed and showed white teeth . " His name is something else , I ca n't say it .... " T'he cook said a number of rapid syllables and bowed again , in his natty brown clothes , clasping his white straw hat , showing his white teeth . Maggy smiled . " Willie seems better . I 'm glad you 've come . " " I brought groceries too . " Sylvia stacked the bundles in Willie 's arms . " Here , Willie , the kitchen  --  where 's the kitchen , Maggy ? " " I 'll show him .... " " Never mind , madam , " said Willie in smooth and perfectly enunciated English which gave Maggy a vague feeling of surprise . " I can find it . " he managed another bow , his arms full of packages , and disappeared unerringly in the direction of the kitchen . Sylvia said : " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear , the only one . I 've gone to every employment bureau in the book . He ca n't stay nights ; he goes home . But he says he 'll do everything , clean , dust , everything . He says he hates to work with anybody ; he 'd rather do it alone . I thought the only thing to do was to try him . Now then , how are you ? I 'm so sorry , my dear . I know this is a shock to you and Fen . But then , it was quick ; that 's a mercy , you know . And he was n't so young any more ; he . . . " She looked at Maggy and said : " But we 'll not talk of that . Where do you want me to put my bags ? I can stay as long as you want me . In fact , I 'm only too glad to ; that is , sorry for the reason but  --  where shall I go ? " Sylvia had n't changed except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast .  | 1Icr lovely , pale face with its brilliant red mouth , her wide eyes , light and clear as aquamarines , with their long black lashes and delicately arched eyebrows , her smooth shining black hair , dressed now rather low over her forehead and ears , and so neat and black and smooth that not a hair was out of place , her rather tall , slender figure , her air of languid command , were all the same . She was really an extraordinarily beautiful woman , so beautiful that seeing her again gave Maggy a kind of shock of renewed recognition of that beauty . She had n't seen Sylvia actually for some months ; she had been in the country , Sylvia away or in town . It occurred to Maggy rather wryly that she would n't blame Fen or anybody for frilling in love with Sylvia . Although in spite of Sylvia 's beauty , in spite of her warmth , her gift of charm , she had never , so far as Maggy knew , been in love with anyone . Maggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sylvia put down her hat and looked around her with a quick appraisal . " Charming . Now then , my dear , how have you been aside from all this ? " Her clear eyes swept Maggy , pinioned her for an instant , and then she smiled a lovely , wide smile . She said unexpectedly , smiling : " What about Fen ? Are you going back to him ? " It was a question Sylvia might ask with perfect propriety ; because Maggy had so recently had a fleeting notion that Fen and Sylvia might have been seeing each other and had questioned Bill , her reply was self-conscious and stiff . " We have n't made plans . I low well you look , Sylvia . " A little flash in Sylvia 's eyes accepted it for rebuff . She said : " It 's been a lazy summer , " and glanced past Maggy into the mirror of the dressing table and touched her smooth dark hair . She was wearing a thin , cream-colored dress , almost the color of her skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched by the sun ; the dress was very simple , and very smart , smoothly molded to the graceful , slim curves of her body ; as her arm lifted , there was a flash of light on her wrist . " How lovely that is ! " Maggy cried . " My bracelet ? It is nice , is n't it ! taste  --  I could n't afford anything  | else . But nice . Now then . . . " her glance went to her bags , " I 'll help you unpack . There 's no maid .. . . " Really you do n't need a maid , do you ? Willie says he can do everything . " They unpacked . They strolled to the terrace , and while Maggy had cleaned and dusted Sylvia 's room , the handyman had been up , had apparently had a key with which to unlock the paling gate , and had got the terrace in order . The awning was down , chairs and tables looked cool and comfortable . Maggy walked along the terrace to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service door set in the wall , below the step that went to the roof ; the door was open upon the bare corridor , uncarpeted , painted a dark maroon . All quite as it should be , nothing out of the ordinary . The brightly covered can that had once held salmon had been taken away by the handyman probably , or houseman  --  whoever had carelessly dropped it . The gate was closed but she even had left it unlocked . She must tell the superintendent that she wanted it to be kept locked . She went for the key to the apartment and again used it to turn the bolt in the neat , set-in lock of the paling gate . The terrace , the penthouse were now really inaccessible ; she went back to Sylvia . At seven o'clock Fen came and , with him , Sloane Pickering , bringing flowers . About a quarter of an hour later Bill came . Afterward she tried to remember everything that was said , everything that was done , and could not .  | SHE TOOK Sloane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long white florist 's box in her other hand . He bent , the light gleaming on the lank , thin brown hair plastered flatly to his bony skull . His sallow face was bony and thin too , the skin was stretched too tightly over his high , flat bones and wedge-shaped jaws . He , like Willie , was natty in a light coat that was only a little too broadly padded over the shoulders , brown trousers , brown suede shoes , and a full and luxuriant tie with a pattern of chrysanthemums . He had a tiny waxed moustache and an ingratiating smile . Fen said that he was an importer ; she had a vague notion that he augmented his income by sundry quiet , small business activities of one kind or another ; he knew everybody ; he had indeed an unexpectedly wide and various range of acquaintances , although she knew little of his original background . He and Fen had met in England while both were in the army ; they had revived the friendship when Fen , a year later than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had seemed to her that it was Sloane who had persisted in that friendship and it had occurred to her , unjustly perhaps , that Sloane was attracted by Charles Brooke 's name , by the Brooke money . Later she had felt that the friendship , on Fen 's part at any rate , was sincere . She had exerted herself to conquer her dislike for Sloane : His manner was that of a close family friend and very correct  --  too correct , she thought suddenly and , ashamed , dismissed it . Fen kissed her and kissed Sylvia too . " Sylvia ! "  | Sylvia 's voice was cool , light and poised . " I 've come to stay with Maggy . " Sloane said , taking Sylvia 's hand : " Hello , Sylvia . It 's nice to see you . " Fen said , his blue eyes very bright , looking at Sylvia , looking at Sloane 's gleaming head bent over her hand , looking at Maggy : " This is a surprise ! To me , at least ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A welcome one , I hope . " " I 'm delighted , of course , Sylvia darling . " Sloane glanced curiously around . " What a charming apart-ment ! " " Show it to him , Fen , " Maggy said . " I 'll put these in water . " The flowers were roses , enormous red roses with long stems ; as she was searching the pantry shelves for a vase , Willie appeared in white shirt sleeves and a long white apron , and informed her in neat and precise English that he had prepared curried shrimp and there was enough of it for all of them . " Do you wish me to bring cocktails to the terrace , madam ? " She nodded . By the time she had arranged the roses and brought the vase back to the living room to place it on the table , the others had apparently glanced around Laura 's apartment and then drifted out on the terrace . A few moments later , Willie too appeared in a neat white coat this time , his black hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his small brown hands perfectly and fully appointed . Fen gave him a look and arched his eyebrows . " Where 'd you get him ? " he asked Maggy as the little Filipino disappeared again . " Sylvia found him . " She smiled gratefully at Sylvia . " Do n't imagine that I checked any references ! " Sylvia said lightly . " I simply snatched him . I 'd lock him up in the apartment for safekeeping , but he refuses to stay nights . " " Oh , well , " Fen said , " the point is Maggy 's not alone , thanks to you . Sloane Pickering sipped his drink slowly ; he drank very little , usually not at all . He eyed the towers , looming blue and clear in  | the hazy twilight , the nearer , green gray mass of tree-tops in the park . " This is the nicest view of New York I 've ever seen ! " None of the talk was in any way personal ; all of them , kindly , avoided anything that might lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggy looked up and Bill was standing in the doorway looking out at them , his look , his quiet manner , and smile as he came forward , avoided it , too . " Hello . " He nodded at Fen and Sloane . " How are you , Sylvia ? I see you 've got a butler , Maggy . He let me in very impressively . " " He 's everything . We 're going to have dinner here , " Maggy told him . Bill stretched his long body on a chaise longue ; Fen poured him a drink . " It 's cool up here , " Bill said with a sigh . " The street 's like a steam bath . " It was cool but there was no wind ; instead , as night drew nearer , the air seemed heavier , almost as if it could be pushed back , as if , indeed , it had to be pushed back in order to breathe . Lights came out , stringing themselves along the city up into th ' " purplish-gray sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright foliage of the hedges changed to silvery gray . Sylvia 's face and dress looked gardenia white . The lights in a very distant tower were turned on and changed at regular intervals from white to yellow , to yellow to white again . " It 's the Grand Central , " Fen said , and Sloane said , watching : " No , it 's nearer Broadway . " Sylvia got up and walked to the hedge and stood , her slender lovely figure outlined in her light dress against the silvery green , the darkening purple sky . " You could n't possibly see the Grand Central from here . But what is it ? " She pointed . " Now , there 's Radio City ... " Sloane got up and went to join her . " Where ? Show me . . . " She pointed again , taking Sloane 's thin hand in her own , starting with Radio City . " There with the searchlight , see , then to the left , there 's . . . Fen interrupted with a short laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " In spite of the laugh , there was an edge to his voice which sounded nervous and tense . Sloane moved and turned , and  | looked at Fen . The pallid lights cast shadows ; Fen , in a chair directly below the brackets , looked pale and , it seemed to Maggy , very tired and drawn . Sloane seemed to see it , too . He dropped Sylvia 's hand and came back to the little group under the lights , and said : " No , but I like Sylvia showing it to me , " and smiled at Fen in a friendly , sympathetic way that made Maggy feel again that she had been unjust and wrong ever to question Sloane 's sincerity . Fen flushed a little . Sylvia looked over the hedge and gave a kind of shiver , and moved away , back to one of the gayly striped chairs near Maggy . " I do n't know what the building is and I do n't care . This terrace is too lofty for me , " she said , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated heights . " Willie announced dinner in a neat , smooth voice at Maggy 's elbow . Candles were lighted in the dining room and reflected themselves dimly in the polished table with its lace mats , more clearly in the high mirror at the end of the room , which indeed reflected them all in a kind of golden glow , a misty , faraway picture of five people , dining , their faces touched with light and the candle flames pointing steadily upward as if no breath of air moved anywhere . Sylvia commented on the mirror . " It 's so pretty . It must be nice to have luxurious taste and money , too . " She sighed . For an instant , everyone looked and time seemed to pause ; everyone was transfixed by that ring of candle-lighted figures , reflected indistinctly , so small bits were salient and recognizable  --  Sylvia 's smooth black hair and the brilliant flash of red that was her lips , Sloane 's light coat , Fen , with his back to the mirror , twisted to look over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggy herself , opposite him , looking remote and faraway , like a visiting ghost of herself . Bill was the only one of them , it seemed to Maggy , who looked solid and real , glancing once into the mirror and then back to the curried shrimp . The picture dissolved ; time rolled on ; it was when they 'd returned to the terrace and coffee had been served that Henry Bell  | telephoned from London and , when Fen answered , asked for rIaggy . Bell 's voice was indistinct but intelligible ; Laura did not come on the telephone at all . " Miss Brooke is asleep , " Henry Bell said . " I 'll call her if you like , but the doctor gave her a sedative . Mrs. Brooke , I wanted to tell you that everything is going well ; the services will be tomorrow . I think it was wise to have the services here at once . It 's much better in every way . If later Fen wishes to come himself and bring the body to America , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all so quick . I hope I 've arranged everything to suit you . " Maggy held the receiver out away from her ear toward Fen so he could hear , also , but the connection was not clear enough ; Fen shook his head as Bell 's voice continued faintly : " And I wanted to speak to you again about  --  well , I 've been worried , Mrs. Brooke . I phoned to you before he died and I talked  --  II thought I talked to you . " " I did n't talk to you . " " It was a woman 's voice and whoever it was assured me when I asked that she was you . I do n't know your voice well enough to recognize it , but  --  well , it bothers me , Mrs. Brooke . Warner  --  I talked to him today  --  he asked me particularly about it . " " It 's all right . We do n't know how it happened , but it does n't matter . " The line cleared suddenly so his.voice boomed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't understand  --  but the point is now , I want to repeat what I said then . The will was drawn up the last day , some hours before he died . I witnessed it ; it 's all perfectly clear . The whole estate is to go to you with absolutely no strings to it . Mr. Brooke  --  I phoned from his bedside ; he was n't permitted to talk " ? his voice faded again ; she could not hear so distinctly ? " he told me though exactly what to say to you . The will  --  he said to tell you that you would understand that . He  --  he would n't let me say any more than that ; just that it would all go to you and you would understand . Oh , and Mrs. Brooke " ? suddenly the line  | cleared ? " he wrote a letter to you . He insisted on writing it . I 've put it in air mail and sent it special delivery . " The line was so clear that Fen could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if there 's anything we can do here , now . " She did and Henry Bell said he did n't know . The line faded and he said in muffled tones to let him know if he could be of any further assistance . " I felt I should tell you exactly what Mr. Brooke told me to say yesterday . I thought I had told you all of this , word for word . That 's as nearly as I can recall it . " " Thank you .... " He said good-bye then , gravely , and hung up . She put down the telephone . Fen said : " He 's an accurate sort of fellow . Efficient . I wonder what the letter 's about . " Bill , in the doorway , said : " We could n't help hearing . That was from London , was n't it ? About the funeral ? " Fen told him , sitting on the edge of the table . " It was Bell . Service there tomorrow , later here . It seems there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll explain about the will . Not that there 's anything to explain ; it 's all clear enough , and for my part , I 've no quarrel with it . " " Will ? " Bill said . " You mean Uncle Charlie 's ? Are the lawyers at work so soon ? " Fen told him the one salient fact ; all the money was to go to Maggy . Sylvia and Sloane came to the doorway and listened too , but it did n't matter . They were all friends ; they would know sooner or later . Bill whistled when he heard it and then grew very sober . The other two were frankly astonished . Sylvia said : " Why did he do that ? Why , that means that Maggy has control of everything ! " She stared at Maggy . " How  --  how queer ! " " I 'm not going to keep all that , " Maggy said . " He did n't mean me to have it forever . " Sloane said : " Did you say a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision for Fen ? " Maggy looked down at her own locked hands , with the bright wedding ring gleaming on one of them as they talked of the letter ;  | she felt that she knew what was in it , and that it was n't about the will at all ; it contained Charles Brooke 's last plea for her to make a new marriage with Fen . She felt sure , somehow , of that . Fen repeated : " But it 's all right . I deserve it . Maggy will manage the property better than I ever could . Only Warner is upset about it , and you know him . " Bill , standing there , solid and tall , his brown face very thoughtful , said : " Well , I see Warner 's point . But if Maggy wo n't take the money ... " " She 's got to take it . " For an instant again , the unwinding reel of time and events seemed to stand still ; there was a pause in which to examine and remember small bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmur away below , the scent of Sloane 's roses and the great crimson pool they made on the table . There w Fen 's face , immobile , as was everything else for that instant , bent downward , clear in the light from the table lamp . She was aware of Bill , too , who took a step forward and then stopped so near that his arm almost touched her own . Sylvia went suddenly to Bill and slid her white arm through his and drew Bill toward her . She said , smiling at him , looking up into his eyes : " Darling , I 'm going to send you all home . You and Fen and Sloane  --  all of you . " Fen slid off his desk . " How about a nightcap first , Maggy ? " It made a welcome little stir and commotion . Bill and Fen went for ice and glasses , Sloane wandered into the library , Maggy went out on the terrace and stood at the hedge looking out over a city that , in the velvety darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those lighted windows , burdened with grief , weighed down with a promise , torn with the complexity of human emotions ? Sylvia came presently and stood silently beside her , looking down at the theater traffic , homeward bound . Bill came with a tray clattering in his hands and put it on the table ; Fen and Sloane came . Nobody lingered over his drink ; it was Sloane who suggested their leaving . " Do you want me to give you a lift , Fen ? Or are n't you going just now ? " " I 'm going now . " Fen kissed Maggy lightly .  | Bill said : " Good night , Maggy . Sleep well . " Sylvia went to the door with them , her white arm with its shining bracelet linked again within Bill 's . His shoulders , his black head disappeared . Sloane , at Maggy 's elbow , said good-bye formally and followed them , walking as he always walked in a shambling , loose-jointed way , smoothing the plastered hair over his skull with a thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sylvia said clearly and competently to somebody in the foyer ; the door closed . Maggy smiled to herself at the suggestion of a brisk professionalism in the art of being a guest that was in Sylvia 's voice . It was her talent , her gift , and she discharged its duties with ease and genuine kindliness . Maggy had a vision of Sylvia going through life in other people 's houses , sent for whenever there was disaster , whenever there was need , recompensed by handsome presents . Unless Sylvia married . She thought of Sylvia 's arm drawing Bill toward her , the friendliness and warmth of her manner , and then instantly told herself that Sylvia would n't be the right wife for Bill ! But why not ? She pulled up her own speculation sharply . Sylvia would be a beautiful and excellent wife for anyone . Besides , Bill 's eventual selection of a wife , whenever it came as sometime it would inevitably come , would have nothing to do with Maggy . She must remember that . She was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream seen in a series of flashing pictures which had no relationship to each other , which were connected only by a like and persistent thread of irrelevancy . Irrelevancy ! She got up out of the easy chair , stung by the word . Sylvia came back and began briskly to turn out lights . " You are tired , Maggy . Go to bed . Willie 's homeward bound and the kitchen door bolted . I suppose I 'd better leave the French doors open on account of the heat . " That night there would be no fancies conjured out of empty darkened rooms , no absurd imaginings of a black bat hovering in the night , entering through those wide-open doors . Besides , the paling gate was securely locked . " I 'm glad you 're here , Sylvia , " she said . Sylvia paused , her hand on a lamp , the light shining upward so  | her face , her red lips , her black smooth hair , were immobile too , another small picture caught from that hot , confusing night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good night , Maggy . If you want me for anything , you 've only to call me . " Willie was proving to be indeed a marvel ; the wide bed in Laura 's room was turned down neatly ; a thermos and glass stood on the night table . For a time Maggy could hear Sylvia moving quietly about the apartment . Later she heard the distant , soft murinur of the little radio in Sylvia 's room . The traffic sounds had diminished to a dim monotonous murmur . The night was languid , with no air moving ; the dark sky pressed lower over the penthouse with its gay terraces . Time escaped its fetters ; it had no boundaries or markings in those thick , dark hours . So Maggy had no sense of time when she awoke with the hot stuffiess fingers of the night upon her face . It was extremely he , one of the unexpectedly tropical-like nights , heavy and humid , which sometimes fall upon New York with clinging , stubborn inertia , almost tasting and smelling of the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chaise longue , stretched out , limp , turning to avoid the glare of the light . She reached for the silver thermos and poured some water into the glass ; as she brought it toward her mouth however , it smelled of a chemical , something distasteful . Silver polish ? Willie was not quite perfection the . She slid sleepily out of bed and took the glass and thermos and emptied them both in the bathroom , running fresh water and sleepily rinsing the glass . The water from the tap remained tepid ; it took a long time for it to run cold . When it did , the cool drink aroused her ; perhaps there 'd be a breeze on the terrace . She put on a dressing gown and went out . She turned on the terrace lights but then , feeling spotlighted there in the black night , observable from other roofs , other towers and windows , she turned out the bracket lights again and settled herself in one of the long chairs . It was faintly cooler . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a chance to think , to assort and array , to try to reason .  | There were no black bats of imagination that night . Everything was calm and quiet and unhaunted by the shapes of fear ; but her thoughts kept glancing off the important things , the main things , fastening on trivialities . Silver polish ; that oddly familiar smell ! Except it was n't silver polish . It was more like peaches , she thought suddenly , whole peaches cooked through so there was an almondish flavor of peach kernels all through them . Dimly some faint note of recognition struck away off in her memory . She dismissed it ; she watched the lights , only a few now , the beacon on Radio City turning and turning , blinking and blinking against thick gray clouds , shooting that long finger of light through them to warn any nightbound airplanes . There were strings of lights going up here and there among the towers , marking elevator shafts ; suites of offices lighted up , a short horizontal layer of brightness blanked out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , squealing away below with hastily applied brakes . Peach kernels ; prussic acid ; cyanide . Cyanide ? She rose , like a sleepwalker , after a time . She went into the penthouse . She had no sense of anything as specific and definite as suspicion . Time passed , however , while she looked in Laura 's library among ranks and ranks of fine editions for the encyclopedias that must be there and were . The encyclopedia she selected was too specific . Sometime later she went out on the terrace again . She sat down , stiffly , in a straight chair and leaned her elbows on the round white table . Well , that was not possible . That was not possible . It was not possible ; it was a black bat indeed , that thought that had wedged itself in Maggy 's mind . Besides , there was no reason for it . It was only then that she realized with a violent sense of outrage and shock , what , actually , she was thinking . But it was wrong ! Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thoughts it gave her ; she did n't like the terrace poised there , surrounded by the soft , still darkness . She did n't like those small , insistent irtelevancies  |  --  if they were irrelevancies . Were they conceivably not irrelevant at all ? The night , the stillness , pressed around her like a net , soft and yielding , invisible and tenacious . She had to get out of the apartment . She 'd simply walk out and not come back . Nothing could stop her ; she 'd Ieave in the morning . There was a flicker of motion behind her . She jerked around quickly , and Sylvia was moving in the drawing room ; her slender figure in a long black dressing gown was silhouetted as she bent over a table . Her hand went out , her white arm shone against the black . She picked up a cigarette and lighted it . Then she came to the doorway and peered out , her figure slender ; Ind sharply black against the light . " Maggy ? I thought you were here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the terrace and stood there ; long sleeves fell like wings around her . " It 's hot , is n't it ? hard to keep . " She yawned and looked all around the dark terrace , the black sky , the little bright strings of lights scattered away off amid the blackness . She yawned again . " Do you want something cold to drink ? I thought I 'd get some ginger ale . "  | Now THEN , thought Maggie thirty minutes later , I 've got to reason this out . I 've got to be cool about it and calm , and above everything else , honest . Exact . Accurate . How much of this preposterous idea that has entered my head is based on fact ? How much of it sheer nonsense ? I 've got to answer that ; I 've got to come to some sort of conclusion that satisfies me . One way or the other . She sat up in bed clasping her knees with her arms , staring into the darkness . She and Sylvia had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beacon of Radio City , saying almost nothing until Sylvia yawned and put her lovely white arms out above her head with a long sigh and said she supposed they 'd better go back to bed . They had done so , turning out lights , saying it might be cooler the next morning . Sylvia 's long black sleeves moved silently around her . She said at Maggy 's door : " Willy said he 'd be here early . I 'll let him in . You 'll have to give him a key tomorrow . Sleep as long as you can , Maggy , and ring for breakfast when you want it . We may as well start him right . " Maggy had n't quite wanted to close the door while Sylvia stood there in the corridor . She 'd waited until Sylvia was in her own room , and then gone to the door and closed it , quietly , so Sylvia would n't hear . But of course a closed door , just a closed door , not locked , gave no measure of safety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use that word even in her thoughts ? She had n't more than tasted the ginger ale , although Sylvia had brought bottles and glasses of ice on a little tray and opened the bottles then and there with a bottle opener . So there was nothing  | Maggy 's glass except a perfectly safe and harmless drink . But if it had been a cup of the Borgia 's it would n't have been presented to her by Sylvia ! She must not digress ; she must try to reason in an orderly and logical way . She must ask herself the most important questions first . ' Well , then , the important questions were two : did those irrelevancies , did that odd and curious taste in the water , add up to an attack upon  --  no , thought Maggy , I 've got to use the right word ? was the water poisoned , was that an attempt to murder me ? To murder me ! cried something incredulous , back in her mind : to murder me ! She shook her head and lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow on the roof really a shadow ? Did it move ? Was someone there waiting , peering out , someone who had put a can of salmon on the steps in order to lure the cat out on the terrace , knowing that Maggy would follow ? That would have to be someone who . Lew Maggy ; who knew of the cat ; who knew  --  she took a long breath of smoke and thought  --  who knew too much . Someone then very close to her . Again she thought , this is not possible ; again she made herself continue . If I am the object of a murderous attack , then the second question is , why ? Why do I threaten anyone ? Obviously she did n't . There was nobody whose safety is threatened because she continued to live . Well , then , who would profit in any possible way from my death ? Profit ? That usually meant money . Fen . The money Charles had put entirely in her care would go to Fen , of course , if she . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't try to murder her . Fen would n't ; there were all sorts of reasons , sound reasons , valid reasons , and they all added up swiftly to a single answer to that question : Fen would n't . So it was n't the money . But never before in her life had so shocking , so astonishing a question so much as entered her mind . Her cigarette had gone out , lying there in the little Crown Derby ash tray with its delicate pattern .  | She lighted another , and then thought : but I 'm wrong about that because of the time . The first night I was here , before any body knew Charles was sick , before we knew he died , before we knew anything about the money being left to me , it was then that I saw ( I thought I saw ) , someone on the roof waiting for me . So if there was someone there , then there 's another motive . It 's not the money and the will . So its not Fen . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , which had thrust itself so stubbornly into her mind that she had to debate its claim to reality ? She went back over and over the whole course of the evening , everything done and everything said ; in the end , she found nothing that was in the faintest degree indicative of ? well , of murder . Murder was for the newspapers ! For the dry , old court records , for history , for anything but for her ! Yet if there had been poison in the thermos , who could have put it there ? Willy . Sylvia . Bill , Sloane or Fen . ( Not possible , not possible , but she had to go on . ) When had Willy filled the thermos ? Probably just before he left . She could ask him . Well , then .. . Well , then it was still Willy , Sylvia ; Bill , Sloane or Fen . There was a time after Bell 's call from London when she had stood alone on the terrace , while the others had moved about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sylvia somewhere about . It would be impossible to prove , even in her own mind , whether or not one of them had slipped quietly , only for a second or two , into the bedroom . She ought not to have emptied the thermos , rinsed it and the glass so thoroughly . Now she 'd never know . If she had n't emptied it , she could have taken it to be analyzed . Where would she take it ? That did n't matter ; she could have inquired , found out , taken it there , proved herself wrong . The shadow on the roof could have only been a shadow . Besides , what would anybody do ? She was a perfectly able-bodied person , alive and alert ; nobody could simply walk up to another person and kill them . Of course there was always surprise . If , say , she had been near the edge of the terrace  --  the fence was almost waist high , but then  | thought of Charles Brooke 's letter and wondered how soon it would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot . Maggy slept late , but Sylvia was about early , for when Maggy , drowzily , heavy still with the fatigue of the previous day , at last stretched out her arms to the red bedside clock , and then , surprised at the time , got quickly up and into a dressing gown , Sylvia heard her and came to the door . She was fresh and crisp in pale-blue linen with her hair perfectly dressed and her lips brilliant . " I thought I heard you , " she said , knocking , and then , at Maggy 's word , opening the door . " Did n't I tell you to ring ? " She went across to the table where a small bell push lay , a square of rose quartz with a jade dog , very tiny , perfectly carved . Sylvia put her forefinger down on the bit of green . " I 've coached Willy ; he 'll bring you a tray . How did you sleep ? " All so ordinary . All so pleasant and commonplace . Sylvia pulled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight flashed on the silver thermos jug and Maggy looked at it , and incredulously remembered her own fancies of the previous night . They had carried her almost to the point of leaving the penthouse . She was ashamed , wholly recovered , and inwardly apologetic  --  to Fen , certainly . To Bill , and Sylvia , and Sloane , and even to Willy . By the time she had showered and tied back her hair with a green ribbon and settled herself in Laura 's pink chaise longue with a breakfast tray on the little table beside her , and coffee and melon and hot muffins on it , the questions of the night had faded from any degree of validity . Willy was smiling , quick , deft , his white jacket spotless ; the breakfast tray was neatly and attractively arranged . Sylvia brought the morning papers , having telephoned down to the desk and ordered them . Over her second cup of coffee , Maggy looked at Sylvia , sitting in the little slipper chair , swinging her slender foot , reading the headlines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes flashed upward . " You 're looking better , Maggy. "  | " I 'm feeling better , " Maggy said with truth ; even when she thought of Charles Brooke it was with sorrow but it was with a softened sense of shock . There is in me , thought Maggy , there is in everyone , an inherent acceptance of natural things , of the shortness of human life , its inevitable pause . Sylvia said : " It 's in the papers . I mean about Mr. Brooke . Would you like to see . . . ? " His picture was there , too . Who had supplied all the details ? Bell ? Or Russell Warner ? She was reading the long columns when Charles Brooke 's last letter to her arrived . Sylvia went to the door and signed for it , and brought it to her . " Here 's the letter , Maggy . I 'll go away while you read it . " The papers fell to the floor with a slow rustle . The letter was addressed by Bell probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , and another envelope , sealed , with a typed address , also : Mrs. Fenwick Brooke . She unfolded the sheet of paper first . The writing was Charles Brooke 's , recognizable and clear in the first few paragraphs , wavering into almost complete illegibility toward the end . It began : " My dear daughter . . . " She wiped her eyes suddenly and awkwardly , on the cuff of her dressing gown . " My dear daughter , You 've been my daughter , you know , my dear Maggy , and my beloved child . If you receive this letter , it will be because I 've got to make a last request . It 's about the money . Fen can not have any of the money , Maggy , except through you . You must understand that . If you and he can mend your marriage so you are happy , my dear , only if you are happy and content , then , of course , you can share the money with him . But otherwise not a cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money she needs or wants ; there are no other relatives . At your death , if you have children , a trust fund should go to them ; if not , and in the meantime to a hospital charity fund ; but never under any circumstances to Fen . "  | He was beginning to tire ; the handwriting was uneven and jerky . Perhaps he rested a little then . The next paragraph was written more firmly . " This is putting a heavy responsibility upon you , Maggy , but I can not do anything else . The money has been Fen 's hindrance , his stumbling block up to now . But it 's not too late . I made them re-write my will ; Fen will have a copy . But the added provision in this letter , which I can make to you , Maggy , only as a request ( or as a command , my dear child , since I must make you understand me ) , is known only to you and to the lawyer here . It is this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short form of a will ready for you to sign ; it is to be enclosed , sealed with this letter in the event of my death . Sign this immediately : have it witnessed by someone outside . Take it immediately to the bank and have it done there and put into safe deposit . I trust you , Maggy , not to fail me . " There was apparently a pause here too but this time when he began to write again , the words were almost indecipherable . Maggy read with difficulty . " I 'll rest now . I can not tell you ; you must know how much you 've meant to me . I ought to give you more explicit directions . You must not tell Fen about this , Maggy . Obey me about this . It 's important . Here is the doctor ; Bell is trying to take this away from me . I know Fen better even than you , but I do n't know what he 'll do , what he 'll say . If I could do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send someone who understands Fen to help you . " The writing was illegible again ; she puzzled over it , and could read only the words : " ... Fen ? Good-bye  --  Bless you . .  | There was no signature . The handwriting had straggled into nothing , blurred by Charles Brooke 's failing strength . Blurred now by the tears in Maggy 's eyes . She wiped her eyes again on her sleeve . She opened the envelope . It was a short , extremely concise and clear will ; she was named : " I , Margaret Brooke ... " ' ' he charity was named . " . . . everything of which I die possessed ... " There was a faint penciled cross , showing the space for her signature . The telephone rang ; she got up , stumbling on her long dressing gown . She shoved the letter and the will  --  her will  --  into her pocket and reached for the extension on the table . It was Fen , and he said : " Maggy , how are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " YES , " she said . " So soon ? What did he say , Maggy ? " She wished there had been time to re-read Charles Brooke 's letter , to think of it , to decide what was best to do ; but the intent of the letter was clear and unmistakable . " Maggy , what did he say ? " She took a breath . " I 've just been reading it now , Fen ; it came only a few minutes ago . " " Well , read it then . I 'll wait . " " I have read it . I 've just finished . " " Then what was it about ? Was it for me , too ? " Yes , she thought , for both of us . " You must not tell Fen  --  Obey me , Maggy , about this . . . " She said slowly : " He must have written it only a little before he became much worse , Fen . Part of it is almost illegible . " " ' What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what my own father said ? " She wished he had written to Fen . Yet Charles Brooke had loved Fen , and with his last breath , almost literally , had thought mainly of Fen and tried to do what he thought wise and best for his son . He might have been mistaken , certainly he was deeply hurt by Fen 's behavior , yet certainly , dying , he had been desperately trying to help Fen . Fen , at the other end of the telephone , was growing impatient . " Maggy , did you hear me ? What 's wrong ? " " It was the letter , " she said truthfully . " I was thinking of him and how he loved us both . "  | " Well , of course . It 's upset you , I suppose , hearing from him like that . But  --  well , I only thought he might have said something , some message to me , you know . " He ought to have written to Fen , she thought again . Fen said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it then . Look here , you and Sylvia might come out to dinner with me . " " Yes . I 'd like to , but the letter ... " " See you then , darling . " She put down the receiver slowly . How could she keep Fen from reading the letter ? Yet how could she fail to observe Charles Brooke 's dying request ? She got out the letter , she got out the will , and read both again , and then for a long time sat there , staring at the rug , thinking . There was in the end , it seemed to her , only one possible decision . Right or wrong , she would have to do what , Charles Brooke had begged her to do . It 's not right , thought Maggy , for the first time in her life blaming Charles Brooke for anything . It made her sole judge of Fen ; sole arbiter of their destinies , together or apart . And then she thought : but he loved me , he trusted me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was his last-ditch maneuver , his weak , desperate last effort . She read the letter again . The phrase , " I 'll send someone who understands Fen , to help you , " struck her only then . It was a curious way of putting it . Charles Brooke had been , literally , dying , but he was not confused ; the rest of the letter was lucid and concise . Had he meant that he was sending Russell Warner ? She could think of no one else . Rising , she folded up the letter slowly . What Charles Brooke had done had bound her to Fen still more tightly . How could she , by her own act , keep Fen from possessing and enjoying money that , no matter how Charles Brooke had felt about it , was rightfully Fen 's ? " Fen can not have any of the money except through you . " It was n't fair . Yet a wave of pity for Charles and for Fen caught her . It was wrong , it was tragic that Charles should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see each other and become reconciled . In any case there was only one thing for her to do . She would sign the will immediately , as he 'd asked her to do . But later , if  | she were sure in her heart that Charles Brooke 's relationship to Fen , had he lived , would have changed for the better , would n't it be right , then , to change her own will ? " Obey me , " Charles Brooke had said , and she would . Ile had said : " I trust you . " Then he must trust her , in the end , to undo any injustice he might have done . Having made that decision she felt better , less oppressed and troubled . She 'd go to the bank at once . She put the letter and her will in the zipper compartment of her handbag . Charles ' draft on the New York bank was still there , the draft he had put in her handbag during those last few minutes before she left London , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft , too . Sylvia knocked . " Had your breakfast ? " she said , putting in her perfectly coifed head . She gave Maggy a rather searching look from those clear , light eyes , and came into the room . " Let 's get out . Go shopping , take a ride , do anything . No use sitting up here and grieving . " She picked up the tray . " I 'll give this to Willy . You get into a dress and we 'll do something . Where 's your car ? " " In a garage , near here . " " Why do n't you have a chauffeur , Maggy ? " " I never thought of it . " " With all that money , " Sylvia said , and sighed . " It 's not my money . " " But that 's what his will said . And anyway , Charles Brooke would have given you and Fen anything you wanted . " " He did give us anything we wanted . He gave us far too much . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do with his money ? " She went to the door , carrying the tray , her slender hack erect and graceful , and then turned to look at Maggy speculatively . " Are you going to keep the money or are you going to make Fen take it ? " Yesterday , Maggy 's reply would have been different . She said now slowly : " I want to do whatever he wanted . " " That means that he wanted you and Fen to patch things up , and in that case , Fen will get the money just the same , so it 's six of one and half a dozen of the other . Is n't that right ? "  | " It 's not my money . I 'd rather not ... " " You 'd rather not talk about it . " Sylvia nodded , unoffended , and went away . It was nearly noon . By this time probably , those short , formal services in London were over . She looked at the few dresses hanging on the scented little satin-covered hangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there 's nothing black for me to wear . A blue traveling suit , a gray shantung dress , a blue cotton , a red-and-white dinner dress in which she 'd dined with Charles Brooke in London . But he would n't have wanted her to wear black in any case . She put on the blue traveling dress again with its tiny bustle and neat , small jacket . She brushed her hair into a shining little cap , parted on one side and tucked in over the ears . She picked up her red handbag . She went past the library with its bookshelves and red chairs and into the living room shaded by the green awnings outside ; there was an effect of coolness in the soft , filtered light . Sloane 's red roses had opened to an enormous crimson pool with a fragrance that scented the whole room . Sylvia , her black hat in her hand , was at the telephone . Her voice was low and it did not sound like Sylvia . Maggy stopped in the doorway , so struck by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard her entrance . Sylvia was as a rule almost too light , too crisp ; now her voice was low , and warm with an unmistakable intimacy . It was so surprising , coming from Sylvia , that Maggy listened in spite of herself , and then heard Sylvia 's words , which too , were surprising , for she said : " .. . you know I will , if you want me to , but I think it 's rather dangerous just now . . . " She stopped ; she did not move or turn , yet there was a tenseness in her back , a rigid look of the hand that held the telephone , a listening look about her smooth black head . Traffic sounds came in through the open doors . The awning made a cool shadow upon the terrace with bright sunlight beyond outlining the green hedge . Sloane 's roses perfumed the air . Sylvia resumed but in her usual cool tone : " . . . I can simply never learn properly to drive . You know that . Maggy seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driving . She 's getting ready to go but now and we 'll pick up the car . . . " She turned rather deliberately and saw Maggy and arched her eyebrows and smiled . " It 's Bill , " she said and turned to speak into the telephone . " Here 's Maggy now . See you later , Bill . " Maggy started forward . " If that 's Bill , " she began , but Sylvia had hung up . " Oh , I 'm sorry , Maggy . Did you want to talk to him ? I did n't realize . " What had she been going to say ? Nothing , really . It does n't matter . " " He was worried about your driving . Thought you were tired . He told me to drive . . . . " Sylvia laughed and picked up her black handbag . " He 's got more faith in my driving than I have . All ready , Maggy ? I told Willy we 'd be out to lunch , if that 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon . " There was nothing warm and caressing in Sylvia 's tone now ; her brilliant smile was exactly as usual , friendly but with no hint of tenderness . How had she looked while she talked to Bill ? Well , and suppose Sylvia at last was really in love with someone , with Bill . Besides her beauty , Sylvia had a certain strength of character ; she was very likely to get anything  --  or anyone  --  she wanted . Why not ? Maggy demanded of herself . Bill would n't be the first man who had fallen out of love with one woman and in love with another . Especially when the first woman was as completely walled away from Bill 's terms of love as circumstances had enclosed her . He would eventually turn to another woman . She wanted him to  --  did n't she ? Some of the warmth and sunshine had gone from the day . The blue-carpeted corridor was , as usual , silent and empty , as if none of the other apartments were occupied . Maggy rang for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on that night-darkened , haunted terrace , she had told herself that she was going to leave Laura 's penthouse , as if there might be some barrier to her leaving . She and Sylvia were now walking  | easily out of the penthouse , waiting in a quiet and decorous corridor , ringing for the elevator , and nothing , nobody , made so much as a gesture to stop them . The elevator arrived and the door slid open , and Sylvia said : " Oh , Maggy , give me the key , will you ? Willy will have to have it . We can ring when we get back . " Maggy fumbled in her handbag , the elevator buzzed and the boy cast a look at the indicator . Sylvia said : " Go on down , if you want to , I 'll give it to Willy and be down by the time you 've got a taxi . " She gave Sylvia the key . Sylvia waved her black hat as the door slid across again . The elevator stopped briefly at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating from her small cap came in with a perambulator . An extraordinarily bright-eyed and self-possessed baby sat in the perambulator and watched the elevator boy critically . Again Maggy thought incredulously : I was afraid . I was going to leave . She stopped at the receptionist 's desk ; a different girl sat behind it this time , blonde with fluffy light hair and horn-rimmed spectacles . There was an extra key , she told Maggy ; ' the handyman had used it and returned it . She took it from a panel in the inner office , and gave it to her . " We were very sorry to hear about Mr. Brooke . " " Thank you . " " Oh , by the way , Mrs. Brooke , did you get your telephone call ? " " Telephone call ? " " Somebody phoned here , I mean so it came to my switchboard . A woman . I gave her your private number . Was that all right ? " " Yes , of course . Did she give you her name ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite early this morning . " For no reason at all , Maggy thought of the elusive woman in black . " She must have lost my number  --  at any rate , she did n't phone to me . If it happens again , will you try to get her name ? " " Oh , of course , Mrs. Brooke . Anybody 's name who phones , if you like . " She thanked the girl and went out onto the street where the sunlight fell warm and dazzling upon her , it , too , sweeping away  | the ugly fantasies of the night . The doorman had read about Charles Brooke 's death ; he was sympathetic and friendly . As he hailed a taxi , Sylvia came quickly from the apartment house and crossed the pavement . She had put on her huge black hat and held it close to her face , shading her eyes from the brilliant sunlight . " Let 's go to the bank , first , " Maggy said , " then we can pick up the car . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was like any other day . Errands to do , hot August streets , taxis and private cars and people everywhere . The greens of the park and , in a few moments shop windows showing furs and fall fashions . Everything as usual except that they went first to the bank and Maggy signed the will Charles Brooke had sent her . It was simple and quick . It had not occurred to her to wonder why Charles had not directed her to take it to Russell Warner , or even to send it to her in his care , until the bank official , leaning over the massive desk in its railed-off space , asked her for the address of the Brooke family lawyer . " We can keep the will here , of course , " he said kindly , " but it 's customary to give it to a lawyer . Unless you prefer putting it in your own safe-deposit box . " She hesitated . She had felt that if she was to follow Charles Brooke 's instructions , she ought to follow them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , the will would be safe with Russell . " I 'll take it to our lawyer , " she said . If there was a touch of curiosity in the keen eyes looking across the desk at her , it was restrained . " Very well . " He sealed the document in a long envelope . He , too , had read of Charles Brooke 's death . He said : " You realize of course , Mrs. Brooke , that this will covers anything that is in your name at the moment , and , unless you should later change it , would include anything you might later possess . Such as , " he added kindly , making sure she understood her own action , " anything you might inherit , say , from Mr. Brooke , after his will is probated and executed . Or , practically speaking from this moment on . This will you have just signed automatically continues in effect . You do understand that ? " She told him yes , she understood . His duty accomplished , he restrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the draft  | Charles had given her . She would understand that owing to Mr. Brooke 's death , they would have to have the check cleared by his executor ; in the meantime , if they could be of any further service . . . He went with Maggy to the door . It had taken a remarkably short time . Sylvia , waiting in the taxi , said drily : " The Brooke money . Nobody ever bowed me through these august portals . Let 's have lunch now . " She would put the will in Russell Warner 's care later , Maggy decided ; since it was Charles Brooke 's wish , she 'd not tell Russell what its conditions were , only that it was her will . Her will ! thought Maggy with a sense of surprise . All that money ! But she was relieved too ; for the present , at any rate , she had carried out Charles Brooke 's wishes . They went to Voisin 's . The cool gray walls , the quiet atmosphere , again the air of everydayness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the balance of reassurance . The captain knew Sylvia and took them to a round , corner table . They were ordering when Sloane Pickering came . He materialized quietly at Maggy 's elbow as she looked at the menu card . She heard Sylvia say brightly : " Why , Sloane ! I did n't see you . " Maggy looked up with a start , and Sloane , his hair plastered to his bony skull , his little eyes sleepy looking , was smiling down at her . " Good morning , Sylvia . Good morning , Maggy . I thought that was Sylvia 's hat over here . How are you ? " Sylvia replied , her lovely smile in her eyes and on her lips : " Sit down , Sloane ; lunch with us . " Sloane was dressed as usual , almost too faultlessly  --  this time , he appeared as the businessman , too well tailored , too correct , so it was like an actor 's conception of a businessman . He said : " No , I ca n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he nodded toward the entrance ? " a fellow 's waiting for me . What are you girls doing ? Glad you got outdoors . It 's much better than to stay at home . Why do n't you take a drive ? Go out to the country house . " " Well , we might , " said Sylvia . " It ought to be cooler up there . Well , glad to see you . " He made a slight , debonair motion with his hand . Sylvia , watching  | him , said : " It 's not a bad idea , Maggy . Let 's drive up to the Brooke place and spend the night . " Sloane rounded the great , many-decked table of desserts ; the man lunching with him had apparently gone on around the corner to the hat-check booth . Maggy thought that idly and went back to the menu . Dislike for anybody was a queer thing . Maggy would have liked to drive up to the country and because the suggestion came from Sloane Pickering , she felt an immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get an early start then . " It was not like Sylvia to insist upon anything . She was always lightly agreeable , a lady to her bones . She said , after a second , her aquamarine eyes clear and quiet : " Of course . Anything you like , Maggy . I only thought  --  it 's so frightfully hot today . Well , what shall we eat ? " The captain , smiling at Sylvia , suggested . A dry Martini , perhaps ? Very cold . A bit of cold Kennebec salmon . A green salad . Iced coffee ? " Ladies , " he smiled , " do n't like desserts . " Sylvia was a dear , thought Maggy , and felt herself piggish . She said impulsively , " It is hot , and I 'd like to get some clothes . Let 's start after lunch . I 'll tell Fen . He said he 'd take us to dinner . " Sylvia 's head was turned a little away . " We can leave from here . You 've got toothbrushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and glanced around the room . " Funny we should run into Sloane . I do n't see anybody else we know , do you ? " Martinis came and then lunch . They talked a little ; rather , Sylvia talked with her usual light competency . Maggy paid the check and Sylvia 's eyes regarded the bills in Maggy 's small red billfold with frank interest . She said , smiling at Maggy : " Money . It 's a fine thing to have , Maggy . You do n't realize what it is to be without a bean in the world . " So the Hunter fortune had really gone . " I 'm sorry , Sylvia . I wish you had all the money you want . " " Oh , I get along . But it does get tiresome sometimes . And if you tell me to marry a rich husband , I shall scream . It 's been told me so often . " " Why do n't you marry ? "  | Sylvia shrugged and rose . " Maybe I will sometime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxi Maggy said : " Let 's stop at the apartment . I 'll have to get Simpson . " " Simpson ! Why ? Willy will see to him . " Maggy shook her head . " I 'll have to take Simpson , Sylvia . I 've got a basket for him . " No more would Simpson have chances to stroll around the terrace , stretching his neck to stare down curiously into Fifth Avenue , down twenty-one stories . " I want to leave him in the country . Lawtie likes him ; he 'll see to him . " " What a fuss you make about that old cat ! " Sylvia smiled and gave Maggy a slow , long look from the shadows of her wide black hat . " You know , Maggy , you 're rather stubborn . " Somebody else had said that lately . Fen ! Sylvia leaned suddenly forward toward the driver . " Stop here , will you ? " she cried and turned quickly to Maggy . " I forgot . I want to leave my bracelet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and join you at the apartment . Yes , this will do , " she said to the driver . The taxi had stopped . Sylvia had got out and was waving , smiling , turning away to cross the street with the light before Maggy had time to reply . " Shall I go on , Miss ? " asked the taxi driver in an exasperated voice . They went on , along the hot wide avenue with the two streams of automobiles sweeping constantly uptown , downtown , stopping at the red lights , engines panting impatiently until the lights changed to green . The pedestrians looked tired , the pavement itself seemed hot and steamy . The driver said with abrupt interest : " What 's the number you gave me ? " Maggy repeated it . " That 's what I thought . Say , look here , something 's happening there . " Something was happening there . There was a crowd around the entrance . There was an ambulance and the blue uniforms of policemen . A traffic policeman waved them across to the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The lady lives here , " said the driver .  | The policeman glanced at her worriedly . " Oh , well , all right . You can go in , I guess . " " What happened , buddy ? " asked the driver . " Woman jumped out the window . Okay , lady . I 'll get you through the crowd . "  | H E WAITED while she paid the driver . He put a wide hand under her elbow and guided her through a rapidly increasing ring of onlookers , past a policeman who would have stopped them , into the foyer . " All right now , Miss ? " he said . No one was in the lobby . The receptionist 's desk , inner office , elevators were all deserted . " But  --  what happened . . . ? " " One of those things , " said the policeman . " Do n't you worry about it , Miss . Ca n't be helped . Take it easy . I 'd go up to my own apartment if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went away , his broad , blue back outlined in silhouette in the wide doorway . She turned irresolutely toward the elevators which stood , all five of them , open and empty . In a moment , an elevator boy came hurriedly from an inconspicuous door at the end of the foyer ; over his shoulder she caught a glimpse of cemented and painted service corridors . The door swung to behind him and he came running to the elevator . " Sorry , Miss . There 's been an accident . What floor ? " " Twenty-one . " " Twenty . . . " He gave her a sharp look and put his hand on the switch , and said , his back to her , as the elevator started upward : " She did n't come from your apartment , did she ? " " What . . . ? " " A woman went out a window , or over a terrace , nobody knows . " He paused and added : " Nobody seems to know who she is , either . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're trying to check to find out  | where she jumped from , who she was . " He paused and added again : " Or whether she really jumped or not . What 's your apart-ment ? " " Miss Brooke 's . " The cage quivered very slightly , indicating in an elegant way that they had stopped . As the door slid back , the boy said , eyeing her : " Oh , yes . You 're Mrs. Brooke . Well , she fell right below your terrace . " Her knees were trembling , her hand unsteady with the key . Simpson came strolling to meet her , yawning . The French doors were open ; Willy apparently was marketing for there was an empty , uninhabited feeling in the apartment , no tiny clatter of dishes , no sound or motion anywhere . But someone had been in the apartment . Sloan 's roses were overturned , spilling themselves in a tangle of green stalks and crimson bloom . The vase lay on its side on the Sheraton table . A great wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . There was n't any wind that day . The awning outside hung still and lifeless . Simpson ? Who never knocked over anything . Willy ? Perhaps Willy had been dusting ; perhaps he was in the apartment ; perhaps he 'd only gone to get something with which to clean up the roses and to wipe up the puddle of water . She went quickly to the kitchen but Willy was not there . He was not anywhere in the apartment . She opened the kitchen door . The service corridor was clean and bare . A note lay below two empty milk bottles . " Two quarts milk . One pint cream . Have you got cottage cheese ? " She closed the door so hard that the sound startled her , for it seemed to reverberate through the apartment , emphasizing its emptiness . She was terribly aware of the ledge outside the kitchen windows with its sheer drop downward ; the boy had said it happened below the terrace ; he meant the wide terrace , probably , at the front of the penthouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and towels and returned to the living room . Kneeling , pushing the soft crimson petals into the dustpan , salvaging what she could  | of the roses and thrusting them back into the vase , drying the wet patch on the table , mopping up the water that soaked into the carpet , she could hear all the time , or thought she could hear , a kind of increased commotion away below . Of course , there 'd be police there . Emergency police . People . But she could n't hear their voices at that distance . It was not like the cigarette , those spilled roses . The cigarette was certain . It was a small but unquestionable fact which indicated somebody 's presence . Simpson must have knocked over the roses . An ambulance wailed suddenly and sharply away below and sounded like a shriek of mortal terror and brought her heart pounding into her throat . She got up . The chairs , the tables , stood like witnesses . The ornaments , the pictures , waited to be questioned . She turned in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror seemed to pause , about to reveal some record it had made . She 'd leave the apartment . She would n't wait for Sylvia . She 'd leave now . But none of it had anything to do with her ! It was the kind of thing that almost every day was in some obscure column of the papers ; sad and tragic , but a part of life in a big and tumultuous city with millions of humans living out their spans of life and sometimes growing tired too soon . It had nothing to do with her . The wail of the ambulance had gone . She went to the kitchen with the dustpan and towels . She came back and began to look for the cat basket . Sylvia would be along soon . They 'd taxi over to the garage where she had stored her car , and soon be on their way , away from the city , out to the sprawling , big old country house with its arching maples and its terraces , its ivy and wisteria making cool shadows , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cat basket when the police came . She did not know at first that they were police . The buzzer sounded sharply at the door and she went to it thinking it was Sylvia . Instead , three men stood there , polite and businesslike in their bearing , but also very observant and firm . None of them  | was in uniform , and one of them was not a policeman at all but the superintendent of the apartment house , and he introduced himself quickly and rather nervously . She was Mrs. Brooke ? Well , he was awfully sorry but there 'd been an accident  --  oh , she knew . Well , these gentlemen were of the police and they 'd like to ask her a few questions if she did n't mind . She did mind . She hated it . It made the thing that had happened very real ; it brought it into the apartment , into her life . She said : " Come in , please , " and led them into the living room and asked them to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain . One of the policemen , except that he did n't look like a policeman in his brown suit and blue tie , stepped without a word onto the terrace and walked to the edge and stood there , outlined against the sky and that still green fringe , looking downward . The other said : " If you do n't mind , we 'd like to identify the woman who fell , and so far  --  she did n't fall from here , did she ? " " No ! " He waited a moment , looking at her with quiet gray eyes . " I 'm sorry to have to question you , " he said then . " It 's shocking , of course , but you see , she went directly below your terrace , Mrs. ? er " Brooke , " said the superintendent , again , looking as if he might wring his hands . " Brooke . And so far , we have not been able to discover what window or what ledge she fell from . Nobody seems to know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on the arm of her chair . " I was out . T'he apartment was empty . Nobody was here . So she could n't have come  --  have fallen . . . " She had no hat , " said the policeman in dry tones as if reading a catalogue , " had n't any pocketbook with her either , nothing to identify her . No pocketbook anywhere , " he said , eyeing her again with those quiet gray eyes . " She was dressed in black . " Dressed in black ! A woman in black had called , had disappeared . Perhaps before she disappeared she had sat in the chair where  | Maggy was sitting , and smoked a cigarette and talked to Bell in London , and said that she was Maggy . Perhaps . But hundreds of women in New York wore black in August . Every other woman on the street wore black . Had one woman in black returned ? The other policeman walked in from the terrace and said : " Were those doors open like this all afternoon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly ' Willy had n't closed them ; certainly they were exactly as they had been when she and Sylvia went away . " Have you been here for the last hour or so ? " " No , I told you . I mean , I told him . " " She said she was out , " said the first policeman . " She said the apartment was empty . " " Doors open and the apartment empty . Well , " the second policeman turned in an eerily congratulatory way to the superintendent : " Here 's one apartment that answers the specifications . Body was on a direct line from the terrace out there , that is , direct as far as we know ; you ca n't always tell about that . " The superintendent did not appear to welcome the congratulatory tone or the information ; he winced and passed a shaking hand over his forehead . The second policeman turned again to Maggy . He was short and heavy with rather prominent brown eyes and a round red face . He said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on vacation . Others had people in them at the time that the woman " ? he paused , and said : " jumped . " " But it was n't from here . It could n't have been .... " " You were not here . Nobody was here . The doors were open . " The first policeman , watching her with those level gray eyes , explained rather gently : " You see , Mrs. Brooke , the point is if she jumped , it was from an open window , or , of course , a terrace , directly above the body . The windows were closed in the apartments where people are away ; that 's easy enough to check . These doors were open . " " But that does n't prove that she came from here , " cried Maggy.  | " She could n't have come from here ! I do n't even know who she could be ! " " Well , well , it takes time to identify anybody , " said the first policeman soothingly . " We have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're taking the top stories first . You see , one of the elevator boys thinks he brought her up . " " Up ? " " To the twenty-first floor . " Maggy dug both her hands into the arms of her chair . The second policeman said : " This is the only apartment on this side that 's got a terrace . I always say it 's easier from a terrace . " The superintendent said weakly : " Could n't she have  --  have closed whatever window she jumped from ? Could n't she have simply walked in from the street and jumped from the corridor window ? Some stranger  --  the heat ... " The second policeman was shaking his head . The first one eyed the superintendent quietly and rather sorrowfully . Maggy said : " I was n't here , and Willy , that is , the cook , was out marketing . I do n't see how she 'd get into the apartment . " There must have been hesitation in her voice for all three men waited for her to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivably help identify the poor , tragic woman as soon as possible . She did not really believe that the woman in black who had inquired for her ( or Laura ) was the dead woman . Nevertheless , she told them quickly . " I do n't know who the woman was and I do n't see how she could have been in this apartment . But the girl at the desk as you come in the foyer , said that a woman had called  --  the night before ? to see me . She did n't leave her name . She ? " Maggy swallowed , " the girl said she was dressed in black . It probably is n't  --  it could n't be the same woman . I have no idea who she was . It does n't mean anything , I suppose , but I  --  that was a woman in black . " The superintendent wiped his forehead again . The first policeman said after a moment : " Were you expecting anybody ? " " No , no ! I was on the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew I was coming . That is , nobody but my husband . I do n't think there can possibly be any connection . " Again there was a slight pause ; then the thick-set policeman with the bulging brown eyes fastened them upon her and said : " Is your husband here ? " " No : " The superintendent swallowed and said : " Mrs. Brooke is occupying the apartment , but the tenant is her husband 's cousin , that 's Miss Laura Brooke . She 's in Europe . " " You 're sure you ca n't even make a guess as to the identity of the woman who came to see you , Mrs. Brooke ? " " No . I remembered it because no one knew I was coming . I thought it might have been someone calling on our cousin , or it might have been one of her former maids . . . " Prudence checked her . Obviously it was better not to tell them about the confusion of the telephone call from London , about the smoking cigarette . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police who , because of a poor woman who had jumped from some window that steaming , stifling August day , would be obliged to sift the truth , question , make endless inquiries about something that had nothing to do with them or with the woman in black , that was not even important , that would result in inquiry and questions about the whole circumstances of Charles Brooke 's death and his will . Charles Brooke had been a prominent and rather famous man ; it could conceivably set in motion the wildest rumors . She wished belatedly that she had said nothing of the woman in black , yet it had seemed right to do so . The quiet , tall policeman turned to the superintendent . " If it is the same woman  --  probably is n't  --  your girl downstairs can identify her . " " Oh , " said the superintendent . " Yes , perhaps . " The other policeman 's brown eyes had a sharper , brighter look . He said , also to the superintendent , " Would you know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooke 's ? No . Well , I 'm not sure . Somebody  | might , but  --  you see , it 's rather hard to keep the same staff in the apartment house , handymen , elevator boys , changing always . But one of them might be able to recognize Miss Brooke 's servants . Yes . " " If they are no better at observation than the elevator boy who thinks he brought up the dead woman , they 'll not be much help , " said the thick-set policeman . " He does n't even know whether she had a pocketbook or not . " " If it comes to that , " the other policeman observed quietly , " I do n't think he 's too sure he brought her up at all . " The superintendent shook his head , frowned at the carpet . " It was at noon . More people going up and down then . " At noon  --  Maggy turned to look out at the sunlit terrace . " But then somebody must have seen her ! All the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The tall man with the quiet gray eyes was shaking his head ; the other said : " They never see them ... " " It happens too often , Mrs. Brooke , " the first policeman said . " They 're almost never seen until it 's too late . And in this case if , say , it was your terrace , there 's the hedge to shield her . " " And an awning , " the other said . " She could even have been pushed through that thick hedge over the railing and nobody 'd have seen who pushed . The park 's across the street , nobody looking up could have seen . Probably nobody looking from any nearby windows . " " Pushed ! " Maggy cried . " But there was no one here . No one would have pushed ... " " I do n't say it happened that way . I say it could have . " " Well , " said the first policeman , " We 'd better get along . " IIe pulled what appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the superintendent . " Even allowing for the people who are away on vacation and the windows that are closed , it 's going to take some time . " The superintendent brightened a little . Obviously Laura was a favorite tenant and he wanted to get them away from her apartment . The short policeman seemed unwilling to go . " If it was  | e twenty-first floor , " he said , " this is the only apartment that is ircctly above the areaway where she fell . " ' lire areaway ; suddenly Maggy had a mental picture of the little piece of paper with the telephone number of the apartment house , fluttering slowly downward to a resting place . " Even if the boy is right , " said the tall policeman , " she could always have walked down a few flights to another floor . There 's the service stairs , accessible from every public corridor . Is n't that right ? " He glanced at the superintendent who was almost too eager to agree . " Yes , yes , indeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell what they 'll do ! It 's a pity . It 's not right . Embarrasses everybody . It  --  I do hope you 'll forgive this , Mrs. Brooke . I realize how unpleasant it is and so soon after Mr. Brooke 's death , too . " As they started away , the policeman with the bulging brown eyes looked at Maggy . " Looks as if you 'd had an accident here , " he said and pointed to the soaked , wet black patch on the rug ; and then to Maggy 's stunned horror , he went briskly to the table , squatted heavily , one pudgy hand on the table for support , and took a handkerchief from his pocket and scrubbed it over the wet , black patch . " What . . . " began the superintendent . " Now , really ... " " Well ? " said the quiet , gray-eyed policeman . " Water , " said the other and got up , his face red from exertion but not at all from embarrassment . They went away then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . The superintendent , wiping his forehead , said : " I 'm so sorry , Mrs. Brooke . Dear me , an unfortunate thing . These wretched creatures . If they 'd only stop to think how inconvenient . . . Well , well , ? fifteen  --  no fourteen other tenants to question , oh , dear , oh , dear . . . " He trotted away after the two policemen . He did n't look at his watch and mutter , but the effect was that of the White Rabbit . She closed the door . Her decision of the previous night had been a wise one . She was now going to leave the apartment . A tragic thing , a shocking  | association such as the thing that had just happened , was reason enough to leave any place , was n't it ? At least for awhile . She wished again that she had not mentioned the woman in black and then perhaps set in motion an inquiry which , for the moment , might suggest that the dead woman had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be only for the moment . Unless , of course , it was the same woman . Something cold and frightening touched her like a hand . But if the woman in black and the dead woman were the same , then who was she ? And why had she come there ? Common sense rejected questions and theory . What had she been doing when the police and superintendent arrived ? Sylvia ought to have come by now , too . She went into the library and looked at the clock  --  three-thirty . They must have left Voisin 's about two-thirty , perhaps a quarter to three . Willy ought to be returning soon , too . She could n't leave until Sylvia came back . But whoever the dead woman proved to be she was going to leave . She 'd remembered then that she had been looking for the cat basket , rummaging around in the coat closet . Sylvia ought to get back any minute . They 'd both go up to the country for overnight , for several days if they felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , empty and shuttered house . Lawtie was there , of course , but he had his own cottage and was seldom in the main house . But they could manage , she and Sylvia . They had two hands apiece and ... The door of the coat closet opened with difficulty because a short piece of privet hedge was wedged under it . It was green , scarcely wilted , freshly broken .  | MAGGY leaned over and picked it up in her hand . It was privet , like the hedge ; it was freshly broken . She started toward the corridor door to call to the police , and stopped . That was nonsense . They were not waiting out there at the elevator , for her to come running out , frightened , panicked , hysterical because she 'd found a broken piece of privet hedge . There were a hundred ways in which it could have got wedged in between door and casing , broken by accident , clinging to a coat , or a duster . Besides , did she really think that the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace outside Laura 's pretty , gay apartment ? Did she want the Brookes  --  herself , Fen , Laura , Charles , who had been the famous one of the family , ? to appear in headlines ? Logic came to support her . Even if the woman had selected that terrace to jump from , she would n't by any possible reasoning have broken off a piece of privet and dropped it just there , before she jumped . Her breath came more evenly . Willy opened the kitchen door and closed it with a loud , candid bang ; there was the sound of rustling paper and a murmur , exasperated , as something thudded to the floor . She went back quickly to the kitchen . Willy , natty again in a brown suit and a white hat , and brown-and-white shoes , was picking up oranges and gathering them into a brown paper sack which had broken open . The packages were dumped all together on the kitchen table . He looked up and swept up the remaining oranges . " I 've been to market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He got to his  | feet and made a sort of deprecating whistle through his shining white teeth , and said , his sloe black eyes watching her : " They tell me there 's been an accident . " " Yes . The policemen were here questioning . They do n't know yet where she fell from . " He shook his head and removed his white hat . " Too bad . Poor woman . They will do it . They were questioning all of the downstairs staff . I had to bring myself up in the service elevator . " He shook his head . " Can I make you a cup of tea , madam ? You look a little upset . " She took a breath . " Yes , I 'd like it . " He moved to put the kettle on . She went back to the drawing room . The commonplace , comforting presence of Willy with his oranges and his worry about prices , his offered cup of tea , had shown up her attack of something very like hysteria for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of privet in the waste basket . By the time Willy brought in an immaculately napkined and silver-laden tea tray , Maggy had found the cat basket and had packed her small cosmetic case . As he put the tray down on a table , she said on an impulse : " Willy , the thermos , the silver thermos you put on my bedside table last night . . . " Yes , madam . " " You  --  I suppose you cleaned it  --  I mean it must have been rather dusty . " " Oh , yes , madam . 1 washed it out carefully with hot water . " " You did n't use  --  well , silver polish ? " " Oh , no , madam . It is n't silver . It 's a sort of nickel . " " Oh . " He lingered . " Was anything wrong with it , madam ? " " Oh , no , " she said . " Oh , no . " She drank the tea ; she looked at her watch and it was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uneasy ; the apartment seemed stuffy and airless , but she did not want to go out on the terrace . She must tell Fen that she was going to the country . She went to the telephone and dialed the familiar number . Someone  | at a switchboard replied . Mr. Brooke was out ; could he take a message ? Maggy thanked him and said no , and put down the telephone . Why not walk over to his apartment ? Exercise and fresh air would dispel the cobwebs of horror . Fen might by then have returned ; if not , she 'd leave a message , telling him her plan . The small , unpretentious and sensible apartment , over near the East River , was almost as much like home to her as the country house . She had lived there much of the time during the war years , when Fen was away and Charles Brooke was kept in town . She could n't sit alone and look out at the terrace . She went back to the kitchen and told Willy she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll ring . Tell her when she comes that I 'll be back in a few minutes . " " Yes , madam . " The apartment house was again collected and calm , functioning with quick and silent efficiency . The elevator came at once ; the boy was silent and attentive and made no mention of the accident . Already , obviously , the superintendent , efficient in spite of his justifiably perturbed manner , had given orders : the least said , the better . The foyer had its usual look of dignity and quiet elegance ; the girl at the receptionist 's desk was the one who had greeted Maggy on her arrival . Again , on an impulse , Maggy stopped at the desk and said : " I wonder  --  the woman who came to see me the night before I arrived  --  she has n't come back , I suppose ? " The girl was friendly and casual , but her eyes sharpened a little . " No , Mrs. Brooke . That is , not to my knowledge . I come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you were not here then when . . . " At the time of the accident ? No , Mrs. Brooke . It was very sad , of course , but it had nothing to do with any of us in the building . Obviously , she simply happened to come in . " Obviously too , the girl had had orders not to talk . But Maggy said nevertheless : " She 's not been identified yet ? " " Not that I know of , Mrs. Brooke . Oh , I 'm so sorry  --  the switchboard ... "  | Maggy nodded and went on . The clots of avid-faced observers had melted away . Traffic was going along its usual heavy course . The doorman saw her and signaled before Maggy could stop him , and a passing , empty cab slid to a stop at the curb . Maggy got iii and gave the number . It was pleasanter to take a cab than to walk in the heat and , in any case , it made no difference . Actually , however , the incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a light on Lexington Avenue another cab stopped beside them , and Maggy , glancing idly that way , saw Sylvia . Her wide black hat shaded her face , but her dress , her figure , her bag in her lap , even the flash of her bracelet were all unmistakable . The window was down ; Maggy leaned forward and cried : " Sylvia , " and Sylvia turned . She looked at Maggy with blank , wide eyes which , for a moment , did not seem to recognize her . Her face was a white and rigid mask in the shadow of the wide black hat , her mouth a drawn , brilliant line . l'Iaggy leaned forward and cried , across the hot pavement , through the throbbing of automobile engines , the heavy smell of motor exhaust , the shrill thumping of the elevated : " Sylvia , what 's wrong ? " The light changed . Her cab gave a lurch forward , and Sylvia 's face changed too , moving into sudden life and naturalness . She leaned forward too , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabs jerked apart . Maggy 's cab went on straight across Lexington ; Sylvia 's turned on Lexington , downtown . Maggy moved to look backward through the window and Sylvia 's cab was already out of sight . She sat back , rather oddly concerned . Sylvia had looked , for that one unrecognizing instant or two , so very white and strange , not like Sylvia . She looked indeed as if she had only then received some violent and shocking news . Yet Maggy must be mistaken . There had been only a deceiving shadow of Sylvia 's wide black hat . In any case , Maggy would see Fen , or leave a message , and return to the penthouse and Sylvia would be there and probably nothing whatever wrong . I 'm the person to be concerned about , Maggy thought wrily.  | I 've got to stop imagining all these things ! It had begun the first night in Laura 's penthouse . It was like a miasma ; like the befogging smoke conjured up by a rather evil-minded genie . It was not anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , a nightmarish sort of fancy and anybody as normally sane and healthy and sensible as Maggy Brooke could put a stop to it at once . Naturally she was shaken by the tragic affair of the afternoon , but that had nothing to do with her ; there was no excuse for letting ugly fancy run rampant . The taxi stopped . She paid the driver and got out , and had her second surprise , for Bill came striding out of the apartment-house entrance , stopped to blink at her as the bright sunlight struck his face . " Maggy ? I did n't expect to see you here . " It was altogether pleasant to see him , his broad shoulders , his brown , familiar face ; but it was also comforting that everything about him was real and known . This time the mental barrier she had built up between them broke down . She caught shakily at his arm . " Oh , Bill , I 'm so glad to see you ! " His eyes sharpened . " What 's happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  I ? a woman " . . . She held to his solid arm . " I 'm so glad it 's you . " " Do n't gibber , " he said . " If you were going to see Fen , I can tell you he 's not at home . I just tried . I do n't know what 's wrong with you but there 's something . Wait . . . " He whistled sharply at a passing cab , steered her into it , and said to the driver : " Start toward Central Park until we make up our minds where to go . Okay now , Maggy . " He settled down beside her and put his brown Panama hat on his knees and looked at her . " What are you afraid of ? " " Bill ! " " You might as well tell me , you know . " They stopped for a light and she thought of Sylvia ; Sylvia had looked frightened . That was it , frightened and shocked . Why ? She turned to Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . You 're easy to look at . " " Bill , am I any different ? I seem just the same as always , do n't I , Bill ? " " Nicer , maybe . " " I 'm serious . " " I could n't be more serious myself . " " Tell me , honestly . It 's important . I 'm perfectly myself , reasonably sensible . Not scary or nervous or anything . Am I ? " " All right , if you must know , I think you 're scared . I do n't know why , but if you mean , do I think you 're wacky in any way , I do n't . What makes you ask me ? " " Because . . . " She stopped . No real need to detail all those absurd ideas . Bill being Bill would not stop until he had run down every notion and proved it right or wrong to his entire satisfaction . She said : " Oh , never mind . There was an accident . It had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the apartment house , but of course they had to question , and I kept thinking of the terrace and it made me ... " His tone was crisp and clear , his eyes intent . " What are you talking about ? " " A woman , " she said , " fell . " " Where ? What do you mean ? " She told him briefly . A woman had fallen from some window or terrace ; nobody knew who it was ; the policemen had questioned her . When she had finished , he offered her a cigarette , lighted one for himself and said quietly : " I 'm sorry , Maggy , these things happen . It always seems remote when we see an item in the paper . Of course it was a shock for you ; it would be for anybody . But that 's not really what 's on your mind , is it ? " " Bill  --  a woman came to see me the night before I got home . She did n't leave her name . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You do n't by any chance mean you think it 's the same woman , Maggy dear ! " " I do n't know what I mean . " " I 'll tell you this , " Bill said , after a pause . " I'ib going to pour a  | drink down your throat . " They had reached the S9th Street entrance to the Park . He leaned forward and directed the driver . " Okay , go around to the Plaza . " Maggy swallowed hard . " Bill , things bother me . " " What things ? " What things ? A shadow on the roof that she was n't sure was there . A smoking cigarette , but he knew about that and thought it was nothing of any possible significance , and he was right . What else then ? A vase of roses overturned . I really am a fool , thought Maggy . " Nothing  --  really . " Bill gave her a curious , long look . The cab stopped and they got out , and the sun beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went up the broad steps into the cool , light lobby with its arches , and the light green-and-white summer covers on the chairs . " Come on . " Bill led her along past the palm and fern-screened tea tables of the Palm Court , around the corner , along back the wide corridor to the cocktail lounge overlooking the park , with its cheery leather-covered chairs , its high ceiling , and carved wood panels . Nothing changed here ; nothing , she hoped , would ever change . The solidity and mellow dignity of the room was comforting . It was early . There were not many people at that hour . " Now , " Bill said , putting her into a chair , " you ca n't talk silliness here . The lady will have a Scotch and soda , " he said to the waiter . He eyed Maggy . " Make it a double . " " Bill , I 'll fall flat on my face . " " I 'll not let you . Relax , Maggy dear , nothing 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment and then said : " Tell me what you 've done today ? Did you have Uncle Charlie 's letter ? " She nodded , pulled off her gloves and put them on top of the big red handbag on the table beside her , thinking of the letter and the will . That was real ; that had happened . " He asked me not to read it to anyone . I 'd like to tell you but ... " He nodded . " It 's your business and Uncle Charlie 's . " He picked up her thin beige gloves and drew them through his hands . " But  | did anything lie said change your feeling about Fen ? Clarify anything ? Help you " ? he said , drawing the wrist of the glove through his brown fingers and looking at it intently ? " help you to make any sort of decision ? " His question sharply reminded her of the wall between then ' which in her anxiety she had forgotten . She waited a moment , admonishing herself . Bill 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them and waited . She said at last : " I 've got to stick to Fen , if he wants me . " After a pause , Bill said : " Oh . " A waiter came and put down their drinks . " Shall I pour it , sir ? " " What ? Oh , no . Thanks . I will . " He put the gloves on the table between them . They touched the red handbag like admonitory fingers reminding her of the course Charles Brooke had put down for her to follow . The only course she could follow . She did not look at Bill , and he did n't look at her . He poured the Scotch carefully , poured in soda , gave it a stir , and set it down in front of her . He poured his own drink and lifted it . " All right , Maggy , " he said , " What you say goes with me . I 'll not worry you . But here 's to the wife I 'd like to have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ; she tried to speak and could not do that either . There was the subdued clatter of glasses on a tray as a waiter passed somewhere near . There was a quiet murmur of voices among the few scattered groups here and there . She wanted to be that wife .  | THE LOW voices of people around them , the faint clatter of glasses , even the walls of the room itself , receded to some infinite distance . The drooping leaves of the park , the clup-clup of a horse along the street , the bobbing of the shabby , shiny top hat of its driver , below the windows , jogging up to his parking place in the plaza , was all of it far away too . She wanted to be Bill 's wife . She had forced herself to ignore her own wish , to deny her own deep knowledge . But that was the truth and perhaps in her heart she had known it for a long time . ' When had it happened ? Where ? But that did n't matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dependence upon her bound her to Fen . Her instinct had been sure ; it had warned her not to listen to Bill , not to remember anything he said . Not to think of him . Not in any sense to weaken her determination . Bill said : " Well , now that you 're looking more like yourself , suppose you tell me really why you were scared . I realize that was a shocking sort of business , but  --  it ought n't to frighten you like that , Maggy . ' What 's really wrong ? " It was safe to tell him all the nebulous , troublesome but small events that seemed to have haunted her since her arrival at Laura 's apartment . Surely it was safe to look at him . She looked up and met his eyes and could not look away . Time must have passed but it had no real relation to seconds . Bill turned rather white . He said at last : " Maggy  --  do you  --  can you possibly  --  love me ? "  | She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge it . Bill said : " Answer me , Maggy . " " I  --  ca n't . " " What do you mean ? No . Never mind , I know what you mean . " He looked down at her gloves . His voice was abrupt and jerky . " I 've got to tell you . You have n't let me say anything . I knew I was in love with you  --  oh , gosh , during the war . A long time ago . I was home on leave and went to Uncle Charlie 's for dinner , and you were there . ' When I got there , you were just Maggy . The girl I 'd always known . I was awfully glad to see you , of course , but not ? and then some damned thing happened . You were pouring coffee and sitting at a table . You had on a red dress , long and full with a little standup collar , and there was a light on the table shining on your head and  --  I could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . And I  --  I was never so sure of anything in my life , and it 's been like that ever since , and what am I maundering about ? " He picked up the gloves , put them down and said : " But there 's Fen . And Uncle Charlie . And , to sum it up , Uncle Charlie expected you to make a man of Fen . And you feel you 're bound to do what Uncle Charlie wanted you to do . " The solid , friendly old walls of the Plaza drew neatly away , receded for miles ; there was n't another sound in the room , or if there was , it was too far away to be heard . Bill said : " Let 's get out of here . " The waiter appeared ; the check appeared ; they were walking out of the room between the tables , two normal , ordinary-looking people , as if nothing had happened . She waited while Bill got his hat . They were on the sidewalk and getting into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense , going back to the apartment . I 've got to talk to you . Alone . " All her composure was gone ; the determined young woman who had given herself orders and obeyed them , up to then , had disappeared . After a moment she was aware of Bill 's silence and she looked at him , and he was looking at her hands with an odd , halfpitying expression . He said : " I told you to relax . Do n't double up  | your hands like that . It 's only me , Bill . We 'll thresh things out and try to do what 's right and fair . " The cab pushed through the traffic . The hot summer air brushed her face . She leaned forward as he held a light for her cigarette . He was half-smiling ; there was an unexpected twinkle deep in his eyes . " You need n't be so  --  so surprised , Maggy . It 's happened before , you know . People fall in love all the time . " Not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late afternoon light made a shady valley of Fifth Avenue . Bill said soberly : " We 'll talk only when you 're ready to . When you know what you want to say . But do n't wait too long , Maggy . I 've got some things to say , too . " But he did n't have the things to say that she had : the final , the irrevocable , the determining things . It was n't fair to Fen to leave the money like that , she thought with sudden passion . It was n't fair to her ! But then , Charles Brooke had meant it to be fair . He had thought that she was constant in her affections ; he thought she truly loved Fen . He had n't thought that all at once , in one second , in one breath , she would find that she could no longer deceive herself , that she 'd have to admit her love for someone else . " Okay , " said Bill again , watching her . His face had hardened , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything 's happened at once . You 've got to sort things out in your own mind , get yourself on your feet . I told you that I 'm not going to worry you and I 'm not . Now tell me what has happened before we get to Laura 's place . I started to ask you back there at the Plaza . You did look scared , you know , Maggy . " He leaned forward to speak to the driver : " That 's the street . You can turn here . . . . " He got out change and said : " Was there really anything to be scared about ? Anything concrete ? Anything definite ? " " No  --  no . I 'll get out of the apartment for a day or so . We 're going up to the country place , Sylvia and I. " " Tonight ? " His tone was absent as he counted the change in his palm . The taxi stopped . " Right away , " she replied . " My car is garaged uptown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Bill was frowning as they went into the foyer . He said , in the elevator : " Keep in touch with me , will you ? Your phone up there is still connected , is n't it ? " " I suppose so . " " Seems a lonely sort of place . " " We 'll not stay long . I 'll take the cat up , see Lawtie and I 'll get some clothes that I need . It 's only to give us something to do . " " Do n't stay too long , " he said , after a moment . At the carved teakwood door , waiting while she turned the key , he said : " Sylvia here ? " The door opened as he spoke and Sylvia was there , standing in the foyer , her wide black hat in her hand , smiling . " I heard your key . Hello , Bill . Are you going up to the country with us ? " He waited a second , giving her , Maggy thought , her heart pounding suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming . Please go with us , Bill . Well , she could n't . She would n't . Sylvia said : " Maggy , there 's been a rather horrid sort of thing . Willy told me . " " Yes , I know . It happened while we were out . " " I 'm sorry , " Sylvia said . " It must have given you a sort of shock . " Her even clear tone , her lovely face , wrenched Maggy back to that second when their cabs had stood side by side waiting for the light . " Sylvia , is everything all right ? " she asked quickly . " All right ? " " When our cabs met at the traffic light , you looked  --  well , I do n't know  --  troubled . " Sylvia 's shoulders lifted . " Not me . But I tried to follow you and by the time I could get my driver to turn , you had disappeared . It 's funny , " Sylvia said , looking at her calmly , " but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could n't imagine what you were doing there . " " I was going to see Fen . " Sylvia said , " So was I , " and laughed . Maggy must have looked surprised for Sylvia added lightly : " I was in the neighborhood . The real jewelers do n't like to repair fake jewelry ; so they sent me to a place over on Third Avenue . So I thought I 'd just go on to Fen 's  | apartment and tell him how we were getting on and that we were going to the country . " Maggy said : " Oh . But you did look ... Sylvia put on her hat , adjusting it in the mirror . " After I 'd thought a minute , I realized you must be going to Fen 's and would tell him our plan so I only left my bracelet and came directly back here . Well , are you ready to go ? " " Fen asked us to dinner . He was n't at home though , Bill said . I 'll phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'll go along to the garage with you , " offered Bill , and looked at Maggy with no expression at all in his eyes and added : " I 'll see you on your way . " Willy appeared and bowed them out the door reassuringly ; he 'd see to everything . They made a little caravan through the foyer and into another cab : Maggy , Sylvia clutching her wide hat close to her face as if in anticipation of the blinding sunlight , the elevator boy with her small dressing cases , Bill , and Simpson under Maggy 's arm in his basket , peering from it with slitted , wary blue eyes and uttering an occasional ringing protest . At the garage they stood for a moment in the blazing sun until Maggy 's car was brought out , the car Charles Brooke had so gaily presented to her . Maggy slid into the driver 's seat with Sylvia beside her , who volunteered to hold the cat basket . Bill leaned across the door beside Maggy to look at the gas gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was oil , water ? How were the tires ? It gave Maggy a surprised and grateful sense of being cared for . Satisfied , Bill looked into Maggy 's eyes . " When you get back , " he said , " we might have a talk . " She felt suddenly that she did n't want to go ; she wanted to stay near Bill ; his hand lay on the door and she wanted to put her own upon it . " Take it easy , " he said . " I 'll give you a ring sometime tonight , just to be sure you get there all right . " She let herself meet his look and there was no need to say anything . Sylvia , at her side , arranging the basket on her knees , said lightly :  | " We 're not going into the jungle , you know , Bill . And traffic is light now . " " It wo n't be light in another hour , " Bill 's lips said ; his eyes said to Maggy : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I love you . " Someone behind them honked impatiently . Bill stepped back , and they began to move slowly along the street . Bill stood for a second watching them . When they waited for the light to change at the corner , Maggy looked in the driving mirror and thought she saw Bill 's tall figure going along toward Madison . They turned and it vanished . " When we get out on the Parkway , let 's put back the top , " Sylvia said , eyeing the car with interest . She sighed . " Maggy , this is a heavenly car . " Traffic was not yet heavy , but it was not very light either ; the necessity to drive and keep her mind on it was welcome to Maggy . Sylvia too was silent as they went down to 57th Street , made a slow way across Madison and Fifth , and on , to the West Side Highway . By the time they reached the bridge , traffic was already pouring thickly out from the city . It was cooler though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross County Parkway and lost a little of the traffic . ' Ibey had put the top down at the first toll gate and Sylvia had taken off her great shielding hat and for the first time in Maggy 's knowledge of her , her black hair was ruffled by the wind so she looked oddly less self-controlled , less poised and certain of herself . She was grateful for Sylvia 's silence . The sun lowered and the green stretches of country , the thick shadows of the trees and shrubbery along the Parkway began to look dark and cool . At Long Ridge Road , they turned off and took the paved Ridge Road and had a leisurely dinner at Emily Shaw 's restaurant , cool , too , with its pleasant , low-ceilinged dining rooms and flowers . When they came out and Simpson , in the car , greeted the bits of steak Maggy brought him with a hoarse murmur of approval , it was almost dark . They struck north then ; and thirtyodd miles further on they turned at last into the winding driveway between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | old maples , toward the great , dimly white bulk that was the house . Sylvia said suddenly , out of the dusk , beside her : " This place belongs to you now , Maggy . Have you thought of that ? " She had n't . She 'd only thought of it as she always did , as home . Separated , or divorced , from Fen , it would n't have been home of course . " It 's not mine really , Sylvia . We 'd better drive around by the cottage and let Lawtie know that we 're here . " She did so . Lawtie was awake and listening to the radio . He greeted her with his usual taciturnity but was , Maggy thought , rather pleased to see her . He was also , she saw when they got to the main house and Lawtie began to turn on lights , shocked and aged by the news of Charles Brooke 's death . He had , however , few questions . The place had not been cleaned since Mr. Fen had dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawtie , however , had aired it . But the house telephone , he told Maggy , had been disconnected . " Mr. Fen ordered it done when he was here night before last , " he said , looking at Maggy , his eyes sober below thick , overhanging eyebrows . " In the morning , before he went back to the city . " So Bill could n't telephone just to be sure that they had got there all right . Lawtie continued . Nobody had come at all since Mr. Fen had gone . Naturally nobody had telephoned to him although the neighbors , the Calloways down the road , told him that several reporters had telephoned in connection with Charlie Brooke 's death . Agnes had telephoned to them , too . " Agnes ! You do n't mean ... " Ile nodded solemnly . " Old Agnes Maclagen . Mr. Fen 's nurse . She tried to reach the house here and could n't , so she phoned to the Calloways and they told her nobody was here but me . She wanted to know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a faithful old soul , " Maggy said , touched . " I 'd like to see her . " Lawtie shook his head . " She did n't say where she 's living . I know she had a pension . And she deserved it . I 'll just take the baggage upstairs . "  | He did so , first opening the wide door for Maggy and Sylvia . " Ile never changes , " Sylvia said . She put down her hat and bag in the hall and looked around . " If I were you , I 'd sell this place . It 's too big . " There had always been , with Maggy , a sense of welcome in the house , as if it knew of her homecoming and wrapped itself warmly and substantially around her , promising peace . Tonight it was subtly different . It was , of course , cool with its high ceilings and its great attic , yet there was a kind of chill in the night , emanating from those closed and darkened rooms . It , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , in a curious way , sentient , as if this time , as with other times , it knew of her coming , but for some mute and mysterious reason deep within it , refused to welcome her . It was only for an instant that the sense of something that was not inimical yet not quite what she had expected either , struck her . She turned on the lights in the library and suddenly the house was familiar again as rugs and curtains , shabby with use , beautiful old tables and wall desk which could never lose their elegance , came out of the gloom . Charles Brooke 's portrait was above the mantel . The rows of books , worn and well read , the brass fender , everything in the room was familiar and homelike to her . Other rooms stretched away into gloom . Oddly , it had never seemed a big house until tonight ; now it seemed enormous . She was thankful that , at least , those rooms were not dust-covered and ghostly as the apartment had been . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her , " am for going straight to bed . You look as if you could do with some sleep too , Maggy . " For the first time too , it seemed to Maggy , voices echoed in the house . She left a light burning on the ball table and led the way up the great old stairway . The hall above , wide and uncarpeted , except for a few thin Oriental rugs spaced at intervals along its polished floor , turned here and there abruptly , following the line of bedroom doors . Maggy turned on lights here , too , and their light , high heels seemed to arouse echoes in the house . She took Sylvia  | to a guest room near the wide , gracious suite of rooms which had been Fen 's mother 's rooms and then her own and on an impulse , with no describable reason found herself another guest room not far from Sylvia . A pleasant room with its crisp , white ruffled curtains , its ruffled four-poster bed , its blue rugs , its white-manteled fireplace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rooms were dusty but in order ; they opened windows , folded away counterpanes and opened beds . " It 's awfully dark in the country , " Sylvia said suddenly , arranging night cream on her bedside table . " Perhaps we ought not to have come . It seems so far from everybody . " Maggy laughed . " I 'm used to it . It 's perfectly safe . " However , when she had said good night to Sylvia and after she had turned out her own light and opened the windows , the late summer night did seem darker than usual , the house more remote from its neighbors . It was a very quiet night ; there were a few drowsy locust , a tree frog off in the distance somewhere . Otherwise not a sound nor , of course , a light anywhere except the diffused patch of light stretching out across the flagstone terrace from the hall windows . She wished that she could telephone to Bill . It occurred to her , then , listening to the faint noises of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill was the way it was going to be , always . That decision , at least , had been made for her by circumstance , by Charles Brooke , by Fen . And by herself when she married Fen . How did one go about it to , as Bill said , make a man of anybody ? Would n't Fen hate her for trying to be a balance for him , a help if she could be a help , but also , by Charles Brooke 's will , a judge ? Wise in so many ways , Charles Brooke had been tragically unwise in his last act . She felt then that the whole undertaking was doomed . A line of his letter returned to her memory . He 'd said he was sending someone to help her . Had he meant Russell Warner , or someone else ? Laura , perhaps . After a long time , wearily , she went to sleep .  | She awoke suddenly but with no sense of alarm . She lay for a few minutes , listening . The country quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog had stopped , there was no breeze to rustle the maples or the ivy that climbed under the windows . It was extraordinarily quiet ; there was not even the faint creak or sigh that an old house seems to give , restless in the night , and is really merely the whisper of a draft under some door sill . Perhaps the silence itself had awakened her . It must be very late . She reached for the bed lamp and the watch she had put on the table . She touched the switch and then rousing a little , clicked the little button back and forth but there was no light . She still had no sense of alarm , for it was nothing unusual in the country ; somewhere along those miles and miles of wires there 'd been a failure of some kind . Her watch had a luminous dial ; it was too small to be very clear but she could see that it was after two o'clock . She put the watch back on the table . And someone walked softly along the terrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As she did so the footsteps stopped . She listened . There was not another sound . Sylvia ? Sylvia would n't creep out of the house at night . Lawtie ? But Lawtie slept like the dead ; his hours of sleep were a religion to him ; it would have taken a fire or a flood to awaken him . There was still no sound from below . No sound anywhere except the drum of her own pulse in her ears . She got cautiously out of bed , waited again , and went softly to one of the windows . It was so dark a night , the shadow of the maples so heavy , that she could not even see the outline of the flagstones below ; it was like looking into a well of blackness . There was no rustle of shrubbery , no soft , light sound of gravel under feet that might have walked down the driveway . No shadowy movement across the lawn . But quite suddenly the ivy outside the screen , within an inch of her hand , rustled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines a careless hand had caught it and pulled . As if a ladder had been pressed against it . A ladder ? She must call Lawtie.  | The house telephone was in the kitchen . She could not go through those darkened halls , the empty cavernous rooms , try to waken Lawtie who could not be waked unless .. . There was the fire bell ! It was in the hall , at the head of the stairs . It was old-fashioned , it might not be in working order , but it connected with Lawtie 's cottage and , she remembered dimly , was on the same battery with the service bells , not on the main electrical wire entering the house . She listened again and heard nothing . The faint jerking of the ivy had seemed to communicate itself from the left , from the end of the house and her own room . The stairway was a little at the right of the room in which she 'd chosen to spend the night . She left the dark , screened window , went softly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dark and empty space . A cool draft from the stairwell touched her face . There was no sound anywhere ; she moved a step or two into the hall . At its end a thin line of light shone under the door of her own room . So someone was there . Only the bell would rouse Lawtie . Where was the switch ? Where was the stairway ? Her hand met the balustrade and its polished coolness , moved further and touched smooth wainscoting . Fumbling she struck some small obstruction , not realizing it was the switch for the bell until , with appalling fury and clamor , the bell broke upon the night , clanging through the house , echoing wildly everywhere , loud enough to wake the dead . She whirled in the darkness back toward the room she 'd left and a door at the end of the hall flung open . A flashlight came full upon her face ; revolver shots rocked through the wild din of the bell . Somehow she was on her knees ; she could feel bare floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen backward , through the open doorway into the bedroom , out of range of the shots . The sound of the bell was everywhere , rocking the world . Sylvia , a dim figure in white came into the hall , a lighted match wavered in her hand casting a flickering light upon Sylvia 's face , white against the darkness of the hall . Maggy got on her feet and caught Sylvia 's wrist and pulled her , too , inside the room and  | closed the door . For an instant they faced each other in the wavering light from the match while the bell shrieked and clamored not of fire but of something violent and murderous that had entered the house . The match burned down and with a jerk Sylvia put it out . In the sudden dark Maggy found the doorknob and caught it with both hands ; both women leaned hard against the door .  | THEY stood there together , pressing against the door , aware only of the bell , of the hard panels of the door for , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the bell stopped . The shrill , continuous din was cut off so suddenly and completely that that in itself had a sort of stunning , shocking effect . Steps were running along the hall from the back , loud , energetic and candid steps . Lawtie shouted : " Mrs. Brooke ! Mrs. Brooke Her fingers were cramped and numb . Lawtie shouted , nearer now , his feet clumping reassuringly along the hall : " Mrs. Brooke ! " She opened her hands and flexed her fingers ; she opened the door and there was light , from a flashlight again , in the hall . Lawtie cried from behind the glaring circle of light : " Mrs. Brooke ? Fire  --  Burglars  --  There was a car  --  I 've called the police . " " I rang the bell . Someone was in the house .. .. " " Are you hurt ? " " No , no . He was in my room . Down there ... " ' The door to her room stood open and black at the end of the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held ahead of him making a jogging silhouette of his stocky figure . The two women stood listening , watching the wavering light in the room where he 'd disappeared ; after a moment he came back . " There 's a ladder at the window . The window 's open . I knew it was burglars . I heard them get away in their car . " " Car ! " Maggy cried . " They 'd parked it down at the edge of the wood , on the other side of the stables . I heard the car start . I was hurrying into some  | clothes . I 'd heard the bell . But when I heard the car start up and get away in a hurry I knew it was burglars and that you 'd rung the bell . So I called the police . But the car has got away by now . " " Suppose they 're still in the house ! " cried Sylvia . She leaned out to peer past the glow from the flashlight , down the dark well of the stairway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreal , terrified , all her poise gone like a garment flung away . " There were shots . One of them has got a gun . " Whoever it was tried to murder me , Maggy thought . That was murder ; this time there was no mistake , no doubt . Burglars ? Lawtie said : " I suppose they thought the house was empty . The police ought to be here in a few minutes . " Lawtie shifted the flashlight and it shone for an instant on his thick , knotted hands which held a large revolver . Sylvia saw it and stiffened . Maggy said , " You 've got a gun , too . " " Well , I do n't know that I 'd be much of a shot and it 's not really necessary anyway . We 'd do better to have a watch dog , Mrs. Brooke . " His voice had recovered its usual dry and rather disapproving tone , but it was also calmly conversational . Burglars . Frightened away . The police coming . Everything under his control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Come on , Maggy , let 's go right now . . . . " Lawtie said : " They 've gone , Mrs. Brooke . No need to . be upset about it now . Besides , I doubt if they 'd do  --  if they 'd have done much damage . Probably a gang of kids , young fellows . " " There were shots ! " cried Sylvia , her voice high and shaky . " Do n't you understand ? Revolver shots . " " Yes , " Maggy said . " I was near the stairway . There was a flashlight and I fell back and I think the shots went over me into the wall . " Sylvia gave a thin , high scream . Lawtie was silent for a moment . Then he said gravely , his voice shocked and unsteady : " That 's terrible , Mrs. Brooke ! I suppose they meant only to frighten you , but that 's terrible . It might have killed you ! " He meant to kill me ; whoever was there meant to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't burglars ? " into the  | silent hall , into the little patch of light , into the deep surrounding blackness , into her own ears . There was another shocked silence on Lawtie 's part . Then he said : " But it was burglars , madam . Who else would it be ? " And Maggy thought : who else would it be ? Yes , that 's the question . You do n't know it , Lawtie , for all you 're so knowledgeable and authoritative . You do n't know it either , Sylvia , but that 's the question . Who else would it be ? Lawtie jerked around . He had heard , as Maggy had not until then , the approaching police car , thudding hurriedly along the drive . He said : " I 'll let them in , " and ran heavily down the stairs . It was a patrol car , and state troopers . They searched the house and grounds , thoroughly yet quickly and said , too , that obviously it had been a burglar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been several burglaries and cases of vandalism in that vicinity and in neighboring districts , country houses presumably closed or under the aegis of a caretaker ; the burglars apparently watched the house , staked it out for entry , chose the middle of the night when people in nearby houses were asleep , cut the electricity in case of burglar alarms and entered it . Lawtie had got out candles while they searched the house , tramping up and down the halls . Maggy 's room was untouched , nothing ' moved , nothing out of place , except that open window with a ladder ( taken from the garage , Lawtie had said , always left unlocked ) , leaning against the window ledge and the ivy below it . Obviously that had been the method of entry . Lawtie , too , found the break in the main electrical wire leading into the house . He had the rough , practical knowledge of the oldfashioned gardener and caretaker . He and one of the policemen disappeared into the darkness for some time , and as Maggy sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly unfamiliar ? room with its worn rugs and its rows of books and pictures of Fen , laughing Fen , young Fen , in his officer 's uniform , smiling at her from the silver frames , lights flashed on , dimming the wavering , smoking candles . Sylvia , who had been prowling restlessly around the room , her black hair now in a neat , smooth knot at the  | back of her neck , whirled around abruptly , blinking in the glare . The state troopers briskly continued their search . Probably not an inch was overlooked and in the end they found no one . Nothing was missing so far as Maggy could tell them . She had given the alarm , they concluded , before the burglars could accomplish their purpose . " I heard only one person , " she told them . " There were footsteps on the terrace . Then the ivy jerked . " " Did you see anybody at all when they opened the door and turned the flashlight on you ? " But there had been only the blinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her consent to their digging into the lovely old wainscoting , and watched them , feeling as if she were in a dream . They dug out three bullets ; two from the wainscoting and one from the wall above . And when they asked her to stand where she had stood when the flashlight came full in her face , Lxawtie 's face turned rather gray and one of the policemen suddenly mopped his forehead . " That was a near thing , Mrs. Brooke , " he said . Another car , summoned by radio , came swiftly up the driveway and the grounds were searched again . In the end they found no one , and only the bullets and the ladder to prove that anyone had been there . " But we 'll get them , Mrs. Brooke . Be sure of that , " one of the troopers told Maggy . " When we do we 'll want you to appear to give evidence . Will you be here ? " " Here , or in New York . Is it all right for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us your address in town . " ' They went away soon after that . It was by then nearly morning . The sky was faintly gray and the great maples outlined themselves in dense shadows against it . A morning mist blanketed shrubs and walls . But all of the lights were on now through the house so its windows blazed like a ship at sea . The house was chilly in the gray dawn . Maggy went upstairs and got into a skirt and sweater and looked with incredulous  | astonishment at the gouged-out holes in the paneling from which the bullets had been extracted . It was not possible ; and it had happened . What would burglars have wanted ? Silver , perhaps ? It had not been locked away . Or sheer looting ? A cold inner debate went on in her mind . Would any burglar , no matter how frightened , fire pointblank at anybody and run the risk of a murder indictment ? The answer to that was clear ; sometimes it happened exactly like that . And if the series of small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London had not happened ( and if a strange woman had not leaped from some window in the same building with Laura 's apartment ) would she have thought of anything except burglars ? The answer to that was clear , too . Yet whoever had stood behind the flashlight had shot pointblank at her . She could not dismiss that . So the chill inner argument started over again . Sylvia had followed her and was sitting on the upper step , her hands linked around her knees , her face pasty white and suddenly rather old , as if the flesh had sagged . Maggy said : " I 'm going to see if there 's something in the kitchen . Coffee , anything . " Sylvia 's head jerked up with a kind of start . Her eyes were so clear and bright that they looked like glass . She unlinked her hands , and cried : " You might have been killed . " Burglars , thought Maggy . Everybody said it was burglars . " I was n't . It may not have been so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes in the paneling and shivered . " But suppose  --  suppose you had n't jumped back ... " She gave a kind of inarticulate sound and put her hands over her face . Her emotion was unlike Sylvia and it was also rather moving . Their friendship had been pleasant and long without having any particular warmth , and Maggy was both touched and vaguely surprised . She would not have expected quite that degree of emotion from Sylvia . She went to her . " It 's really all right , Sylvia , it 's all over . They 've gone and we 're perfectly safe . " Were they ? she  | thought . But the police said it was burglars . Try to believe it , she told herself . " Come on , we 'll make some coffee . The thing to do is to forget it . " " The thing to do , " Sylvia said flatly with that blank , glassy look still in her eyes , " is to go back to town , right now . " Why not ? Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not brought the peace that Maggy had hoped for and expected . They 'd have returned in a day or so , in any event . " All right , " Maggy said , " in the morning . . . " " It 's already morning , " Sylvia said bleakly and followed her downstairs , out through the brightly lighted , stately dining room with portraits looking at them from wood-paneled walls , and into the light , shining butler 's pantry . There was a small electric stove there and they moved about making coffee , with dawn coming through the windows . The fragrance of the coffee was itself rather heartening . Sylvia 's face began to look more natural . They were sitting there , Sylvia on a high stool , Maggy on the table edge , drinking coffee , when Lawtie came back . The troopers had gone ; there was to be a thorough search and investigation . An attempted burglary was one thing and serious enough . But a panicky burglar with a gun and a hasty trigger finger was another . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nobody on the place now . And I 'm going to watch the house now so you 'll be at peace for what 's left of the night , Mrs. Brooke , " Lawtie said , his bushy eyebrows frowning and troubled . Peace , Maggy thought , was an ironic word . She wondered briefly what old Lawtie would say , what he would do , if he knew how far from peace she was or could be , if he knew the shocking reasons that kept her awake and pacing the room , lighting cigarettes , putting them out unsmoked , staring out the window as the morning light came gradually and fully over the wide lawns and hedges and gardens below . A shadow on the roof above the penthouse , or nothing . A taste of almonds in a small , shining thermos jug , or nothing . A dead woman who might have jumped from Laura 's apartment , who might have known Laura , who might have visited the apartment the day Maggy arrived , or  | might have been a complete stranger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dustcloth , on a coat , or might have been broken in some ugly and sinister way that would not bear thinking of , that was not likely or reasonable . And now a frightened , looting thief with a nervous finger on a gun , or a cold-blooded , deliberate attempt at murder . She sat on the wide window ledge and looked down . The heavy clumps of lilac and azalea shrubs had taken on soft shades of green . The sun lay in patches on the lawn and a robin was digging hungrily . If it was a deliberate and planned attempt to murder her then there had to be a motive and the salient , indeed , the only comprehensible motive for murder was for profit , and who would profit by her death ? Except , he would n't ; if the shots had come a few feet closer , if she 'd been killed , then all the Brooke money and property would go to charity . Fen would have only the small annuity , enough to keep him from starving , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , her own will were found ; she must give it to Russell for safekeeping . ) But of course Fen did n't know that . He did n't know of Charles Brooke 's instructions ; he did n't know that Maggy had signed a will . Had Fen , knowing of her affection for the old cat , coaxed him out onto the terrace with a can of salmon invitingly open , waiting for her to follow ; waiting for her to go to the roof as she had almost done , waited his chance , and failed because she had not done what he expected her to do ? Failed because he had planned the whole thing badly , clumsily , as an amateur would plan it ? Failed , perhaps , because he lost courage there at the last ? She thought with a kind of sickening dismay : Fen ? A wave of complete incredulity caught her again . Fen would n't do that . Besides , suddenly and gratefully , she remembered Lawtie 's telling her that Fen had had the telephone disconnected , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country .  | He had said , night before last , had n't he ? She 'd ask him ; she 'd nail it . But nevertheless she had to go on . Had Fen quietly walked into Laura 's bedroom without being seen and put that  --  well , put anything in the thermos ? That was less blundering , that was less clumsy , even for an amateur . But had he ? And if he had , how had he got , say , cyanide ? But the encyclopedia had already answered that , too thoroughly and too well . Almost anybody could get cyanide ; it was sold for photographic supplies , it was used for gardening ; probably Lawtie himself had enough weed-killing preparations containing cyanide to exterminate most of the population of the village . And had Fen now , that night  --  that would be easier for him , simpler ! He knew the house . He 'd have known where to hide his car ; where to find a ladder . She got up , shivering in the cool dawn . Except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room at the end of the hall . The state troopers would explore ; they would take the bullets as evidence . But what use were bullets without a gun with which to compare their markings ? They would look for fingerprints and tire marks ; probably they would find neither . Fen , or anybody , would have known enough to wear gloves . She paced the floor ; she sat down again and stared at nothing . Probably the explanation the police gave was right . But suddenly to Maggy it was as if small pieces of a jigsaw puzzle had begun to show a relationship , a kinship of design to some larger , clearer pieces , and all of them put together suggested , at least , the slow building of a very sinister and ugly picture . She wondered what the other pieces might be . Other pieces scattered about , as yet not discernible , in the future ! Surely there would be no more attempts ! That thought brought her to her senses like cool water splashed in her face . She sat upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . She 'd stop it . She 'd have to stop it . So far , she 'd been an automaton , doing , saying , whatever was expected of her . Arguing , but dismissing her own arguments . Another attempt  --  well , there  | would n't be another attempt . She was warned now . She would do something to protect herself . She 'd  --  exactly what would she do ? Tell somebody . That was it . She 'd tell somebody . She 'd tell Bill . Bill , I think Fen is trying to murder me . Yes , Fen , my husband . The boy we 've both known almost all our lives . Fen .. . No , that would n't do . She 'd tell Bill  --  except she could n't . Bill was in love with her and she was in love with him . Therefore , for some obscure but very important reason , she could n't , she simply could n't go to him and say : Fen is trying to murder me . No . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no sense because with another part of her mind she could not accept the hypothesis that Fen would try to murder anybody . But she must do something ; she 'd tell Russell Warner . He must be the person Charles Brooke had said would help her . He would laugh at her . He would at the most listen and show her how wrong she was and how terribly unfair to Fen . She thought then , suddenly and clearly : I 'll tell Fen .  | INSTANTLY it seemed the right course . It was direct ; it was fair . Mainly , it reduced the figure of a problematical murder to its own dubious proportions . Probably that figure did not really exist . Certainly she had no fear of Fen ; therefore , in a curious but logical way , he was not a potential ( and up to now , disappointed ) , murderer . She would tell Fen . If it were Fen , it would warn him . It would show him that she was aware of what was happening . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She and Sylvia had decided to get what rest they could and then drive back to town during the early afternoon . She 'd see Fen as soon as they got back to town . She put her head back on the cushions . A decision , any sort of decision , was in its way therapeutic ; it was both bracing and , in an odd way even though it might involve an effort that was hard to make , satisfying . She watched the morning lay golden lights over the bright green lawn , the shaded thick hedges , the rows of gaily red and golden zinnias in the cutting garden , down below the row of empty hot beds . She went to sleep . They left for the city shortly after noon . If the state troopers wished to talk to Maggy again , they or Lawtie had only to telephone her and she would return . It occurred to Maggy that police were becoming a rather frequent and recurring factor in her life . Up to then , they had been kindly but impersonal , remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly while Sylvia roamed through the suite of bedroom , bathroom , dressing room ,  | and stood for a long time staring at the deep dress closets . " It 's nice to be rich , " she said once , dryly . Simpson was settled contentedly in Lawtie 's cottage , or rather , when Maggy went to see him before she got into the car , on the doorstep , his black paws tucked under him , a weather eye on the fat sparrow which was flitting about with dangerous abandon over the gravel walk . Lawtie was clipping a border near by and she went to speak to him . " We 'll be off now . " " Yes , Mrs. Brooke . " " Lawtie , when did Mr. Fen arrive ? Night before last , I mean . " He frowned . " I do n't know , Mrs. Brooke . I go to bed early , you know . He was here in the morning . I got his breakfast . He had n't then heard about Mr. Brooke . " She hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison gone from your weed-killer supplies ? Has anyone taken something that has cyanide in it ? She could n't . Instead , she said , less directly : " Have there been burglars before ? I mean , have you ever thought that someone was  --  oh , prowling around the house ? Or  --  or the greenhouse or  --  or anywhere ? " He shook his head . " No , Mrs. Brooke . " She waited a moment , and then said good-bye and went back to the car where Sylvia waited . Sylvia again was rather silent on the trip into town ; she spoke indeed only once or twice . Once she said lightly , but with an underlying shiver of reality in her tone : " Maggy , you know if anything had happened to you last night , it would have been my fault really . I suggested coming to the country . " " Sloane Pickering actually suggested it , " Maggy replied as lightly . " Oh , you mean yesterday at lunch . Yes , Sloane did say something about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and the last toll gate before Sylvia spoke again , and then she said , with an effect of casualness : " I saw Joan Greenfield a few days ago . " " Joan . . . " Maggy let out the clutch with a jerk . " Joan Green-field ! "  | Sylvia was looking straight ahead . Maggy did n't turn from the wheel but she was aware of Sylvia 's large black hat , unmoving be side her . Sylvia said : " I see you know about that little affair . Of course , it did n't mean anything . That is  --  do forgive me , Maggy , that did sound horrid and patronizing , did n't it ? " " No , that 's all right . Fen is really so  --  so young , you know . lie went right from a governess and tutors into the army . " " And he 's very rich , " Sylvia said , and sighed a little , and added abruptly : " Joan was looking very smart . That fair , fluffy sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've forgiven Fen for any little dereliction in that direction . " Forgive Fen , when Maggy herself had suddenly , without warning , discovered herself to be in love with another man ? Who was she , thought Maggy rather wryly , to talk of forgiveness ? " I do n't suppose it was Fen 's fault , exactly . " Sylvia 's hat jerked around . " Dear me , Maggy , do n't you care ? " But Sylvia 's tone was a little sharp , a little too inquisitive . Maggy said : " In any case , it 's in the past . " After a second , Sylvia 's hat moved again so she looked ahead . " Oh , of course , " she said , accepting the closed path with her usual social adroitness . " My dear , we 're going to get there in time for a long cool tea . Pray heaven there 's a breeze on your fancy terrace . " " Pray heaven illy has not departed , " Maggy said , and finding her way off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool , green park , it struck her suddenly that there was something in that short conversation , she ought to have given more attention . Something that had struck a kind of bell in her consciousness . She sought back for it and failed to find it and edged her way between two taxis and on toward Fifth Avenue . Willy had not departed . He came at once , beaming , whitecoated , as if he had known they were coming and expected them ? which , as a matter of fact , was a quite correct impression , for Fen , hearing them in the small foyer , came running from the library . " Maggy , I 've been waiting for you . For God 's sake , burglars ! " He caught her hand , his eyes were brilliant and blue with excite  | ulent . " Are you all right ? Lawtie said you were n't hurt , but I had to see for myself . Good Heavens , Maggy , it might have killed you . " He was exactly as usual . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Sylvia and both of them were talking at once . Burglars  --  dreadful ? Maggy might have been killed  --  oh , yes , the police are investigating . She could see them in the mirror over the table . Sylvia talking animatedly , taking off her wide black hat so her face emerged more clearly into the light ; Fen questioning , his light hair shining above the gray , tweedish jacket he was wearing . He looked , as always , very clean and well groomed and fresh , not as if he had been up all night driving , escaping after an attempted murder ! Why had n't she telephoned him instantly from Lawtie 's cottage ? It would have settled one question at least , for if he 'd been at home then , he could n't have manipulated an attempted murder elsewhere . On the other hand , he might merely have been out at a night club or with Sloane , which would have proved nothing . But there was such a thing as an alibi ! It struck her then how curiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence and attempted murder , of police investigation , a world which has even its own rather terribly pungent vocabulary : investigation , fingerprints , ballistics  --  alibis . Fen was wearing a bright , gaily designed tie . He was adjusting it absently and she looked at it in the mirror and recognized it as being one of a half dozen she had selected and given him for a birthday , last year , was n't it ? It suddenly seemed to prove that Fen was not a murderer , either in fact or intention . How could anybody to whom you 'd given six ties ( and hung over the counter for a long time choosing the designs ) be a murderer ! The very recollection of the salesman 's thin face , with its little black toothbrush mustache , as he held the ties to his own chin , obligingly , while she 'd stepped back and scrutinized to get the effect , that was almost in itself a proof .  | " It was simply the luckiest thing in the world , " Sylvia was saying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of her own hands in the mirror , hovering over her handbag , and they were , queerly unsteady ; she looked at them as if they were the hands of a stranger . They seemed for an instant to have a life of their own , and part of that life was a capacity to think as well as act . Well , she 'd turn around and face Fen . She did so , and there was nothing complex or confused in her emotions , because she had no feeling whatever about him . He was a man she had known and that was all . She did n't care whether he smiled or sulked . She did n't care whether he told the truth charmingly , or equally charmingly lied . She did n't care whether he went out with a dozen Joans , or fell in love with them and married them , or did n't marry them . She did n't care what he did or did n't do except  --  except she was married to him , and Charles Brooke had given her an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Only two or three seconds could possibly have gone by while Maggy stood there listening to Sylvia 's and Fen 's talk , in that time , she thought later , she became really an adult . Then she saw that Sylvia , tactful as usual , was going away , giving her a chance to be alone with Fen , so they could talk together without even the knowledge of Sylvia 's nearby presence . She was quite obviously inventing errands , saying she would be back for dinner unless Maggy had other plans , adjusting her hat again . Fen , charming as always , was protesting . " Do n't go , Sylvia . Where are you off to ? Do n't be in such a hurry . " He was looking all at once a little sulky , like a small boy . Sylvia laughed brightly and touched his arm . " I 'm going to pick up my letters at my apartment .... " " ' Well , wait a few minutes and I 'll drop you there .... " Sylvia would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . I 'm also going to do devious and feminine shopping , and this and that , and I 'll be back , Maggy dear , in time for dinner . " The door closed after her . Willy had disappeared . The silence  | of the apartment seemed to close around Maggy again , so it placed a kind of impalpable barrier between her and Fen , between her and the world outside and below the walls which enclosed those charming , luxurious rooms . She could not even hear the murmur of the elevator as Sylvia must have summoned it . Fen , still watching the door after Sylvia 's abrupt departure , turned with a kind of start toward Maggy . The look of sulkiness had vanished ; he smiled . " What a devil of a thing to happen ! The one night you were up there . It could have happened , I suppose , almost any other time . It 's been going on for some time in the vicinity , you know ? kids , amateurs getting into houses that have been closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house that he 'd never have heard an army of looters . What did the police say about it ? " Now , she thought , is the time to tell him . He had n't changed ; he was exactly the same . Seeing him , talking to him , he became at once Fenwick Brooke , dispelling the ugly , distorted vision of another man behind those candid blue eyes , another figure , a sinister alter ego hovering behind him . He was exactly the same , but her resolution remained . She said : " Let 's sit down . I want to talk to you . " His eyebrows went up . " Dear me , that sounds forbidding somehow , Maggy . What have I done ? " " You have n't done anything , " she said slowly , " but I want to tell you just the same . " The frown became a perplexed , puckered wrinkle . He shrugged . " Okay , go ahead . What 's the matter ? " She led the way into the living room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have known that he was following her . The French doors were open . The awning was down , shading the terrace , except for a few wide streaks of sunlight shooting across it , making an arabesque of shadow from the hedge . The room itself was spotless , orderly , shining ; the vase of roses had gone . She forced herself to look calmly across the terrace to the hedge at the end below which , they had said , the woman in black had fallen .  | She sat down in an armchair and looked up at Fen who had taken up a lounging position , one elbow upon the mantel , and was looking down at her , still frowning a little but with a faint smile on his mouth . It was a warm city afternoon , but she was rather cold and tired . Naturally , after the night she and Sylvia had had ! Naturally , because she was about to accuse her husband of attempted murder . She denied that swiftly , but she said directly , steeling herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the least change of flicker or expression : " I think someone is trying to murder me . " His reply was a startled and incredulous explosion . " What ? " She did n't repeat it but sat looking at him , watching his face change from that startled and incredulous look to one of deep concern . " Why , Maggy , " he cried , " look here ! You 've been frightened by this burglary business ! " " No , it was n't that entirely . Things happened before that . " " Things ! " He stared at her and then came quickly to her and pulled out the footstool . He sat down close beside her and looked directly into her face . " What things , Maggy ? ' What do you mean ? Nobody 's trying to murder you . That 's nonsense . But something must have given you that idea . Something  --  this is n't like you , you know . You 're always perfectly level-headed and ... " " I still am , I think , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that made me think that . It 's several things . It 's  --  been accumulating . " " Darling , what 's been accumulating ? " His face looked animated , alive and curious . There was not the faintest shadow of knowledge or guilt in his brilliant blue eyes . " That 's what I want to tell you . It 's been going on ever since I came here . It  --  followed me last night to the country house . It " Darling , what ? What do you mean by it ' ? " She meant that series of irrelevancies which occasionally , sharply , seemed to show themselves as relevancies attached to a main pattern and then as suddenly submerged into nebulous and unrelated pieces again . She meant the hovering , invisible combination  | of perplexites and doubts which , all at once , erratically , focused themselves upon some event and gave themselves thereby a tangible authority , a validity which , as suddenly , shifted away and became nebulous and invalid again . She said , discarding logic , emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paramount need to know the truth : " Where were you last night , Fen ? " He stared at her again for a moment , his eyes fixed and blue , his face gradually stiffening . Then he sprang to his feet . " Good God , Maggy ! " She remained firm ; she did n't speak ; she did n't apologize as she would have done months before when he looked like that . She met his eyes directly and waited . After a moment , staring down at her , he said : " Do you realize what you are saying ? " She nodded , watching . She was another person ; she was n't Maggy Brooke . She was an observer , an outsider , watching herself in a rather curious cool and remote way , watching Fen . He said : " But I  --  I ca n't understand you , Maggy . You do realize that what you are doing is asking me if I broke into my own house last night and took a shot at you . " She was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " There was another silence in the pretty , feminine room , with all its lovely muted colors , with the mirror over the mantel in the dining room reflecting them both in the distance , through the open doorway . Fen said , finally , slowly : " Well , all right . I do n't know what 's happened , but something  --  something besides this burglary business  --  must have happened to make you ask me a question like that . I do n't see how it could have entered your mind . I do n't understand . It 's not like you . But I 'll answer it . I 'm not angry . I 'm surprised , of course . I guess stunned would be a better word . " He was n't angry . It surprised her . He walked over to the table and stood for a moment , and then came back . His face was perfectly natural , his eyes candid and direct . " At least I 'll try to answer . You may have to take my word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needing an alibi to prove to my wife that I did n't  | try to shoot her . " He smiled and went on . " Now then , I had dinner last night with Bill . He phoned to tell me you 'd gone to the country so we made a date and ate at his club and then we went to a movie . I got home  --  I do n't know  --  around eleven . Sloane dropped in and we had a highball or two . Then I went to bed . I heard of the burglary when I phoned to Lawtie in the hope of getting you . You had just left for town and he told me all about it . Darling , you 'll have to believe me . It was n't me . It seems awfully silly , even to tell you that , but you see , since you asked for it , I have got an alibi . " He stopped and looked at her and said : " Or have I ? What time did it happen ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh . " He eyed her for a moment and shrugged . " Well , I could have got there , I suppose , but I did n't . Oh , look here , Maggy , this would be horrible if it were n't so silly . Why are you asking me this ? Do you really , seriously , believe that I  --  I did that ? " She said slowly : " I 'd better tell you the rest of it . . . . " " I think you 'd better tell me everything on your mind before I question your intelligence  --  or your sanity . " He laughed again as he spoke , his eyes brightly blue . " It began , I think , with the cigarette , here , the day I came home . " " Oh , but that ... " " I know . I reasoned myself out of any feeling of uneasiness about it , still it was there , Fen , and somebody took the telephone call from Henry Bell . " He made a gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait . That night there was a storm . The cat was gone and I was afraid he 'd gone out on the terrace and I was afraid he 'd fall . " " I told you he might . . . " I know . Something woke me up . I 'd forgotten that ; something fell over and I think it was that table , the small one there . . .. " She pointed to the table that had been on its side . The ash tray stood on it and the paper knife , the little bronze Psyche was no longer there . It occurred to her that Willy must have moved it when dusting , to some other table ; she glanced around the room  | and did not see it , and went on with her recital . " I went out on the terrace . It was raining and dark . Around at the kitchen end , right below the steps that go to the roof , I stopped and someone was there . " " Maggy , are you serious ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm listening ! Was someone there , or did you imagine it ? And if someone was there , why should it upset you like this ? " " The next morning I saw an open can of salmon on the lower step . " Fen 's face was a mixture of incredulity and surprise . " But look here  --  can you possibly mean  --  well , you must mean that you think somebody lured the cat on the terrace in the hope of luring you out there and ... Maggy , you simply can not be serious about this ! " " And then a woman fell  --  or jumped  --  into the areaway directly below the terrace . " " Well , you did n't push her , did you ? " " I am serious , Fen . " " I know . Poor woman ! I read about it . Bill told me . Too bad , but those things happen . But it ought not to upset you like this , Maggy . It had nothing to do with you . " After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're not what ! " " Perhaps  --  perhaps she came to see me , Fen . . . " She stopped without finishing her sentence . The tiny segment of the conversation with Sylvia as they turned from the West Side Drive into the city , the small phrase that had somehow seemed to touch some memory with a light finger , and yet had eluded her , now discovered itself . She said suddenly , not knowing she was going to say it : " Fen , where is Joan Greenfield ? " " Joan . . . " Again he stared at her with surprise ; comprehension came slowly into his eyes . " Joan Greenfield ! Can you possibly mean , Maggy  --  can you possibly  --  mean that I . . . ? " He dropped down on the footstool and began to laugh . He laughed  | and laughed until there were tears in his eyes , his face was red and gasping . He put his head in his hands , and laughed until his laughter was high and thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still laughing : " Do you want me to telephone to Joan ? Ask her if she 's still alive ? Ask her to tell you I did n't get her up here and push her off the terrace ? " The buzzer was sounding in the foyer . She was aware of Willy 's neat , adroit figure going through the hall to answer it . Fen was still choked with laughter when Willy came back to the screen and said : " Mr. Sanderson is calling , madam . Do you wish to see him ? " Fen got out his handkerchief . " Darling , if you 're going to put Bill through this third degree too , please , please let me listen . As a matter of fact , he 's a far more likely prospect than I. A dark horse , if there ever was one . Dead-pan Bill . " He got up and went to the door . " Come on in , Bill . " He turned and made a little bow toward Maggy . " Enter the second murderer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad you 're back , Maggy . I phoned out to the house and heard the news . I had to see for myself that you were all right . " Willy said , in the doorway : " I 'm sorry , madam . There 's someone else . He says he 's from the police . " " Never mind , DeJohn , I 'll tell her myself . " The short thickset man in plain clothes who had questioned her the previous day entered abruptly . His prominent brown eyes looked all around the room , at Fen , at Bill , at Maggy . He addressed her . " We 'd like you to take a look at the woman who was killed yesterday , Mrs. Brooke . We want you to identify her . "  | FOR A MOMENT , no one said anything . It was rather as if they felt , all of them , that if no one spoke , if no one recognized the detective , if no one seemed to hear his preposterously unexpected request , then he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a brown suit . He did n't . Instead , he came further into the room and stood there , planted solidly with his polished brown oxfords on Laura 's rug . Fen and Bill spoke at the same time . Fen said : " But she never saw the woman in her life . " Bill said : " I take it you 've got authority for this . " Ile replied to both of them at the same time , his bulging brown eyes going unconcernedly from one to the other . " Mrs. Brooke does n't know whether she 's ever seen her before until she looks at her , does she ? I 've got plenty of authority . The whole police department , if that 's enough for you . " Again there was a short silence . Maggy was aware of Willy 's unobtrusive departure from the doorway . Finally , Fen said : " But , look here ! Why do you ask my wife to look at the  --  the body ? She 's got nothing to do with it . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to jump off the roof . .. " " She fell directly below that terrace . " " But ... " We believe that she came to the twenty-first floor . " " Still that does n't mean ... " " And , " the police officer said , " the receptionist downstairs says she thinks the woman came to see Mrs. Brooke on . . . " He got out a notebook and looked at it , and said , " The eighteenth . That 's  | the night before Mrs. Brooke got back from Europe , is n't it ? " He turned directly to Maggy , and she said in a flat small voice : " Yes . He nodded once . " The woman asked for Mrs. Brooke . Therefore she must have had some reason to believe that she was to arrive here soon . " Bill said suddenly : " Is that girl sure it 's the same woman . . . ? " The man in brown blinked and hesitated . Maggy had a quick impression that he 'd have liked to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " She thinks so . She 's not sure . " " Well , " Fen said with triumph . " There , you see ! " The man in brown turned a stolid , and an honest look toward Fen . " The fact is , " he said , " she did n't have much chance to recognize her . Nobody will have until they get a police , or maybe a plastic surgeon at work . " Maggy thought : I must n't feel like this . I must remember it has nothing to do with me . Bill came and put a hand on the back of her chair , steadyingly , as if he 'd put it on her arm . He said : " We understand , Mr. ? er ... " " DeJohn . Maurice DeJohn . " The man in brown said , giving Maggy , for no traceable reason , a vague feeling of surprise . Fen said : " But is she sure it was Mrs. Brooke that this  --  some woman asked for ? It might have been Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed to hesitate briefly between what he wanted to say and what he had to say . " Well , yes . It might have been . " There was another short silence , all of them looking at the detective who looked at the terrace . The detective said , as if he felt the impact of their several thoughts and answered all of them at once : " If it 's the same woman , she must have known either Miss Brooke or Mrs. Brooke , so we 'll have to ask you to try to identify her , you see ? " Bill said suddenly : " But is n't there some other way to identify her ? Has n't anybody come forward and said who she was ? Has n't anybody so much as questioned her disappearance ? Inquired for her ? Done anything ? "  | DeJohn said , " No . " " But look here , what about her clothes ? What about her handbag ? What about . . . ? " Again DeJohn replied with a reluctant honesty , brown eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a black dress , no label , probably gone with cleaning . Underclothes the same . Shoes , black calf pumps , came from W ? ' s , it 's a big department store in Philadelphia . She had no handbag . " All at once his brown eyes came back , full upon them like headlights . " That 's queer , because women always carry handbags , full of junk mainly , but all sorts of identification . Always . Point is , where 's the handbag ? " " Maybe she did n't have any , " Bill said , but rather dubiously . Maurice DeJohn shrugged . " We think she had . " " Maybe she did n't have one on purpose , " Fen said . " Maybe she did n't want to be identified . Maybe she did n't want her family or friends or anybody to know . " " Maybe , " Maurice DeJohn said . " But maybe somebody else did n't want her to be identified . " " Somebody else . . . " Fen began and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " If somebody pushed her , of course , " replied DeJohn . " But that 's murder ! " Fen cried . " Surely there 's no question about it . It was suicide , was n't it ? " " It looks like it . We have to cover the possibility that it was n't . " There was another silence . Then Bill said : " We understand that , of course . But  --  murder ! There was n't anybody here to push her , for one thing ! " " I 'm not saying this was , " DeJohn replied . " It 's all routine . Well , that 's all , Mrs. Brooke . I thought I 'd better come and see you about it . We 'll telephone when we want you . " " When . . . " began Maggy . " Well , I do n't know , " he said and added unexpectedly : " May take awhile to " ? he hesitated , and finished ? " to get her fixed up . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptionist ? You said she recognized the woman  --  or thought she did . " " Yes . That 's why we want Mrs. Brooke . If it was the same  | woman , surely Mrs. Brooke would know her . " He brooded a moment and then came to himself with a lifting of heavy eyebrows , and said : " Then we 'll have the receptionist look at her again , and the elevator boy who thinks he brought her up to this floor . We 'll let you know , Mrs. Brooke . " " I ca n't ! " cried Maggy suddenly . She was trembling violently , even her voice shook . Bill 's hand went from the ' chair to her ann . Fen said hotly : " Of course she ca n't . This is an outrage . I 'll get a lawyer . You ca n't make her . Maurice DeJohn 's full round eyes looked at Fen , looked at Maggy . He said : " Sorry , Mrs. Brooke . I 'll phone when we want you . Good afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : " By the way , there 'll be some fingerprint men here . And they 'll want to search your place for her handbag too . I hope you do n't mind . " He hesitated , and added again honestly : " We have to do it , you know . Good afternoon . " Fen started toward the foyer and stopped as Willy 's voice came from beyond the doorway : " This way , sir . " They remained , all three of them , perfectly immobile , like figures in a waxworks , until they heard the door from the foyer to the outside corridor close , and Willy 's light feet patter softly kitchenward . Cars , away below , stopped suddenly for a light ; one of them had brakes that squealed loudly . Finally Bill said : " Well , this is the very devil . " Fen said hotly again : " We 'll get a lawyer ! Maggy ca n't be dragged through anything like that . I 'll get Russell Warner . " " It wo n't help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . " " I do n't think he can do anything about it . I 'll go with you , Maggy , if you want me to . " Fen was already at the telephone , dialing . They listened while he got Russell Warner and explained it . He hung up after a moment looking rather disconcerted . He turned to them . " He does n't seem to think he can do much . But he said he 'd come and see you . He said he 'd go with you , too . " He shot a look at Bill . " We 'll all go . "  | Bill said , looking down at Maggy : " Do n't think about it . It 'll take only a minute or two . They make these things impersonal , you know , quick ... " " How do you know so much about it ? " snapped Fen , suddenly angry sounding and sharp . He got out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead . " I know just how Maggy feels . I 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell them you 're sick . Tell them anything . " " Oh , do n't act like that , Fen , " Bill said good-humoredly . " Maggy 's tougher than that . She 's not going into vapors about this . It has nothing to do with her , any of it . " Fen sat down and lighted a cigarette . " You would n't think Maggy had any common sense if you knew what she has just been saying to me . You would n't think . .. " He blew out smoke and looked at Maggy , and said suddenly : " Maggy , I want to talk to you alone . " There was another slight but rather tense pause . Then Bill said with a short laugh : " I 'm not ready to go just yet , Fen . " " Oh , that 's all right , " Fen said . " Any time . You know what I want to say . " Bill looked down at Maggy . " I told Fen last night that I  --  how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going now . Can I come in to see you tonight ? " " Courting ? " Fen said , lifting his eyebrows . " She 's still my wife , you know . " " That , " Bill said with sudden force , " I am not likely to forget . Good-bye , Maggy , and take it easy . You did n't know that woman . It 'll be over in a minute or two and you 'll never hear of it again . " He nodded at Fen and started for the door . Maggy sat like a doll , as if she could n't move , until he 'd reached the doorway , and then with belated politeness she rose , but Bill was aware of it and turned and grinned a little . " Do n't I know my way by this time . " He lifted one hand in a brief wave and in an instant disappeared . The door to the outside corridor closed again loudly . Fen said with a sulky look : " He knows his way , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ? Not that I 'm censorious or anything . I 'm just curious . As I told him , you are my wife , you know .  | And not only that , but you 've got all the family money . I 'll not suggest that that fact interests Bill but  --  I 've got a right to be interested in what you 're going to do with it , have n't I ? " Maggy got up and went to the French door , but that brought her to the terrace facing that green privet hedge , now outlined sharply against the lemon-colored , late-afternoon sky . She turned back abruptly . " Fen , what did they mean by fingerprints ? " He shrugged , his face still rather sulky . " I do n't know . Routine , police procedure . " " Whose fingerprints ? " " I tell you I do n't know . What does it matter ? For God 's sake , Maggy ! Are you going to divorce me ? Are you going to marry Bill ? " She came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the little memorandum pad with its gay red initials : " L.B. " Clean now , a fresh sheet on top . The Psyche stood beside it so ' Willy had moved it ; not that it was important . She lifted it absently ; it was remarkably heavy for so small a thing . Fen , behind her , said : " Well ? I 've certainly got a right to ask you . Are you going to get rid of me so you can marry Bill ? And live happily ever after on the Brooke money ? " She put'down the bronze . " No . " " Maggy . . . " He got quickly to his feet and came toward her . He was going to put his arms around her ; he was going to cement what he took to be a complete reconciliation . And all her heart had gone out the door with Bill ; would always go with him no matter where he went . Fen 's shoulder was against her own . He jerked abruptly around when Willy said from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve cocktails or tea ? " It was like a reprieve . She said : " Which would you like , Fen ? " " Neither . " " Nothing then , Willy . " " Yes , madam . " Maggy said suddenly : " Willy , did you move this from the table over there ? "  | " This , madam ? " He came forward . " Oh , the little statue . Oh , no , madam . I put everything back exactly as it was when I dusted . " " You mean that it was exactly here this morning when you dusted ? " " Oh , yes , madam . " His brown face wrinkled up thoughtfully . Then he said : " I believe that the first morning , when I dusted , it was on the little table . But this morning , I 'm sure it was exactly where it is now . Someone must have moved it yesterday , Miss Hunter , perhaps . " " Oh , " Maggy said after a moment . " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He vanished quietly . Fen said : " What on earth are you thinking , Maggy ? You look so  --  so white and queer . " He was right , of course . He must be . Sylvia had moved it . Or Willy himself had changed its place and forgotten . She turned violently away from the small statue toward Fen who was looking at her , waiting . She said : " I 'm upset , Fen . I 'm not myself . All this ... " Fen smiled . " I knew you were not in love with Bill ! I had to listen to him , of course . " " Did n't you mind ? " she asked with sudden curiosity . He replied promptly and easily : " Why , no . I know you , Maggy . Bill was being very noble and heroic and all that , but I was n't worried really because I  --  well , " Fen said , " you 've always been in love with me , you know . I 'll go along now , Maggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix things up about our marriage , any time you like . We might  --  oh , take a trip or something as soon as we can . How does that strike you ? " He smiled at her and said : " When you feel like talking , I 'd like to see my father 's letter . Any time . . . " She could n't talk of that now either . She could not , she would not think up excuses to keep him from reading it . But he was already going to the door ; he said over his shoulder : " Maybe you 'd better tell Bill you 're going to stick to me . No divorce . Put him out of his misery . " She was silent and spent , leaning against the table , her hands  | supporting her . Suppose she told him the truth . Suppose she said : I love Bill with my whole heart . Suppose she said : I 've got to stick to you because of your father . Because I ca n't do anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net . He sensed something in her silence and turned abruptly , his blue eyes brilliant and questioning . " By the way , you did n't put Bill through your delightful little questionnaire . You did n't ask Bill if he drove out to the country place last night and took a shot at you . " " He has no motive for that .... " He laughed and interrupted . " And I have ? Well , my dear , think twice . Since when has Bill been making love to you ? Before or since he knew you were to have all that money ? " " That makes no difference to him . " He moved so that the light from the terrace struck sharply across his face again . He said : " Maybe not . But you asked me who borrowed the money , Maggy . The money I  --  borrowed . I would n't tell you . You 've got to promise not to tell anybody that you know . Besides , he 'll return it . " " Do you mean Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's all right . Only if he needs as much as twenty thousand , he needs more , and you 've got it . " " Bill ! " She left the desk and took a few steps toward Fen , staring at him . " Fen , I ca n't believe  --  did you lend that money to Bill ? " " Did n't you hear me say so ? " Fen gave an abrupt laugh . " I did n't mind that , but I was rather annoyed to think he wanted my wife too . And the family cash . Well , good-bye , darling . " " Fen . . . " She followed him into the foyer and he was picking up his hat , smiling a little . He said , " Now do n't get all upset and nervous about that , Maggy . It 's nothing , really . Bill 's my oldest friend . " He looked at his hat and said , " Besides , how could I blame him for wanting you ! I 'm in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You asked me pointblank if I 'd been trying to murder you . It 's not very sensible , but if you 're going to be thoroughly absurd , suppose I ask you a question or two . Why does n't Bill have a motive ? "  | " But .. . " " He still owes me quite a considerable sum of money for a man in his position to pay . Bill 's not got a cent except what he earns . He knows I 'd never insist on his paying me . But you might . I 've told you before , Maggy , that you 're oddly stubborn . Anybody who knows you knows that . Would n't it be rather easier for anybody who owes me , or rather owes Father 's estate  --  owes you in other words , that much money , either to marry you or " ? he shrugged ? " dispose of you ? " " Fen , that 's nonsense ! " " Not half as nonsensical as your accusing me . " " Besides , he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back  --  before we knew ... " " Somebody knew about my father . Somebody took that phone call from London . " " It was n't Bill . He was with me . " " Maybe . Maybe . But think it over . Well , good-bye darling . When you 've got your right senses back again , let me know . " He laughed and waved and went away quickly . I am not , Maggy told herself after awhile , going to think about anything . I 'm going to read . I 'll listen to the radio . I 'll go out and take a walk . I 'm not going to think about  --  about Bill . About a woman in black . About a little bronze statuette that is so heavy , that could strike so tellingly , that was n't where it ought to have been . I 'll unpack . She did so very slowly , taking as much time as she could , forcing herself to concentrate on arranging the stacks of underclothes , shaking out the wrinkles in dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Schumann A Minor Concerto , and then some Mozart and then some news . She put on a thin white dress and red sandals and brushed her hair . She sent Willy for the evening papers . As he was leaving , Sylvia came back . She was tired , white , and old looking . She put down her hat and bag with a sigh . There were heavy shadows around her aquamarine eyes and she said , smiling as ever , politely , that she had a headache .  | " It 's a perfect horror of a headache . I 'm going straight to bed , if you do n't mind , Maggy . I 'll take some aspirin . Tell Willy 1 do n't want any dinner . No , no , there 's nothing you can do for me . I 'm better alone . I 'll sleep it off , truly . . . " She went to the small red-and-white guest room and closed the door . Obviously she meant what she said . Maggy found extra aspirin tablets in the bathroom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . But she had to ask Sylvia about the little Psyche . " Sylvia , the statuette , the little bronze  --  did you happen to put it on the big table , beside the telephone ? " Sylvia 's white face showed only pain . " I do n't know what you mean , Maggy . " " The little Psyche  --  did you change it ? " Sylvia shook her head . " I ca n't remember any statuette . Is it important ? " " Oh , no .... I hope you 'll feel better soon . " " Thanks for the aspirin . " It was then almost dusk . Maggy had her dinner alone in the dining room with candles lighted and Willy coming softly in and out of the pantry . She was sitting over coffee in the living room when Bill came . By that time , it was fully dark with lights stringing themselves magically , as if without support , through the velvety night sky . He came in , heralded by Willy , and took coffee . He was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cup in a leisurely way and took another . He talked of the day , of Sylvia 's headache , of Willy 's perfection , of a client who had come into the office late in the afternoon , of the news which he turned on at the radio beside him . Willy came and removed the small silver tray . Bill said : " Maggy , I want to talk to you . Seriously . " He glanced around the room with all its doors and then came to her . " Let 's go out on the terrace . I 've got to talk to you alone . " He put his hand toward her and smiled . " You 're not afraid of the terrace now , are you ? "  | BY NIGHT the terrace was different . With her hand in Bill 's , it was different . The hedge made a dark , leafy wall , touched with silver where the lights from the library shone upon it , almost meeting the protecting canopy of the awning . The chairs were deep and comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep , velvety blackness , haloed now and then by street lamps . ' They stood for a moment , caught by the spectacular and lovely panorama of the city at night . Bill said : " New York . It 's queer how somehow , some way , wherever you are , it 's still the center of things . Look down , if you want to , Maggy . You could n't possibly fall . ' This fence is solid and high . I 've got your hand . But do n't make yourself look down or go near the edge ; do whatever you want to do . " " How did you know I was afraid ? " " Well , it was n't a nice thing to happen  --  and oh , you know . When you 've had a sort of accident with a car , the idea is to get right in a car again and drive . The psychologists have a name for it . I 'm no psychologist but I hate to see you afraid of anything . " She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearby buildings with their magnetic statement of height . She put one hand on the fence and it was reassuringly solid and high . The hedge brushed against her . She would n't think of that small  --  and heavy ? bronze statuette or a broken piece of privet where it had no right to be . Bill said : " Why were you afraid of that guy this afternoon ? The policeman , I mean . " " I was n't .... " " It was an unpleasant sort of thing to be asked to do , of course .  | I mean , to try to identify that woman , but it was more than that that bothered you . Hating to do that sort of thing is perfectly comprehensible , " Bill said in a natural and reasonable voice , " but it was more than that with you . You were scared and . . . " He held her hand and led her over to a chair and settled himself beside her . " You were afraid yesterday when I met you at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , you decided you were being silly and had n't anything really to be afraid of . Maybe I made you feel that way because that 's what I thought . And I really thought that you needed to see it that way . " He released her hand and leaned his head back against the chair , and went on in a leisurely way : " I think that I unintentionally talked you out of it  --  maybe intentionally . But I did n't like the way you looked this afternoon , Maggy , so let 's have the whole story . I 'll try not to talk you out of anything this time . What 's in your mind ? " She said : " Bill , you talked to Fen . I mean about  --  about us ... " He nodded . " I did . Last night over steak and mushrooms . " " What did you say ? " she asked , rather taken back by his casual tone . " Well , " Bill lifted one hand and looked at it in the half-light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down again . " I said , I 'm in love with Maggy . I thought I 'd better tell you . ' Something like that . " She waited and he seemed to think the topic closed and watched the distant flicker of the beam on Radio City as if it were the only point of interest in his thoughts . She said finally : " What did he say ? " " Well , he did n't say much . There was n't much to say . " " But ... " Bill said unexpectedly , but rather tonelessly , in a guarded way : " He did n't seem to think I had much chance . " Oh , Bill darling , she thought with contrition , you do n't have , I do n't have , but it 's not for the reason Fen thinks it is . She had to tell him ; she had to tell him immediately . She wished she could show him Charles Brooke 's letter .  | Then Bill said , " The salad came and we got to talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Maggy after a moment , feeling rather flat . Bill 's dark head turned to look at her . He gave a little chuckle . " No point in saying any more . He understood ; I understood . " " Men , " Maggy said , " are very odd . " " Not at all , " Bill said with another faint chuckle , " just primitive . " His voice changed . It was as if he had put his hand toward her again in the night , as if he held her in his arms . He said : " I love you , Maggy . I 'll always love you . " It moved away an absurd , small wall of reserve . She turned toward him and cried : " Oh , Bill , Bill , we do n't have a chance . I 've got to stick to Fen . You do n't understand . I ca n't tell you , but that 's the way it is and I ca n't change it . " There was a long silence . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted sky . Finally he said : " Maggy , do you love me ? " " Yes , " she cried . " Yes ... " She put her hands out toward him but he did n't seem to see them . He said , still not looking at her , seriously : " Well , that 's what matters then , is n't it ? " " Oh , yes , Bill , but ... " " Why ca n't you divorce Fen ? " " Because  --  I ca n't ... . " Divorce is  --  nobody likes it , that 's true  --  but I do n't think that 's your entire reason , is it , Maggy ? " " That 's not the reason . " " Then the only other reason is . . . " He paused and got out cigarettes and said , " You 've got a sense of responsibility for Fen and that 's very serious of course . Sometimes that 's the whole basis for a happy marriage . But not when  --  if you love me , Maggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife for Fen . I realize I 'm arguing my case , but that 's true just the same . However , " he waited a moment , and said , " if you 're sticking to Fen because you want to , because it 's important to you , that 's different . I 'll not say a word . If you 're going to be happier that way  --  it 's imperative . In any case . . . "  | He got up , walked to the edge of the terrace and stood for a moment with his hands in his pockets before he came back to her . She could see his face dimly in the light from the library windows . He was frowning , his hair ruffled from the cool night breeze . " I told you I 'd wait until you 're ready to talk about it . I want you to think it out . Get your bearings . I want you to be sure . I really did n't come tonight to talk to you about that . I want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be something you 've not told me . You looked so frightened , my darling . I ca n't have that , you know . So tell me everything there is to tell . " He knew the general course of events . He did not know the small things , the peculiarities that seemed to give those events an inexorable significance . She said : " I think . . . Oh , Bill , I 'm afraid someone is trying to murder me ! " He stood perfectly still , his tall body looming like a blockade , like a wall , between her and the night sky and the hedge , ? from which perhaps a woman had fallen . At last he went to a chair , pulled it up nearer to her , and sat down . Ile reached out , this time in fact , in the darkness and took her hand . " Why do you think that ? " he said in a voice that was so easily and deliberately conversational that for a moment she was not aware of that deliberate control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect that was really when you found someone was in the apartment and had taken Bell 's telephone call from London , was n't it ? lVell , then what happened ? " Then what happened ? In a rush , all at once , she began to tell him . The stormy night , the cat , the shadow on the roof , the salmon the next morning . The table that had been knocked over . " Well , " Bill said and thought for a moment . " Then what ? " Then what ? " The next morning , the morning after the storm when Fen came and Russell Warner  --  but you know about that ? you know about the scratch pad by the phone . And then  --  that night , the night you and Fen and Sloane were here to dinner ? " she stopped and took a breath and told him about the thermos . That startled him . He sat upright abruptly , staring at her through the dusk . " Maggy , are you sure ? "  | She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water ; she 'd rinsed the thermos and the glass thoroughly . " Go on , " Bill said in a queer voice . And then a woman , who had fallen from some window or terrace directly below the terrace where they sat then . A woman in black . Sloane 's roses , knocked over on the floor . A broken piece of privet . A small bronze statuette , mysteriously moved out of place , heavy enough to strike an all but lethal blow . " The fence is high and solid . I do n't see how anybody could be  --  well , pushed over it unless ... " " Unless she was knocked out first ? " " Yes . " There was another silence before Bill , his face rather hard and white against the night said : " But even if that was murder and not suicide , Maggy , it was n't aimed at you . " " No , but it happened , Bill , here , and then ... " Then the burglars . The darkness of the country house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . Bill got up and paced the terrace , back and forth , back and forth , into the area of lights from the living room , out of it again . It was growing later . Traffic sounds below had subsided to a murmur . Finally he threw his cigarette over the ledge . " It 'll probably land on somebody 's hat , " he said , and came back to her and sat down again , leaning forward , his hands linked between his knees , staring at them . " Okay , Maggy . There are three ways of looking at this . One way , the way I honestly think it is right , that there have been simply a series of accidents , troublesome things , but unrelated ; perplexing , but if we knew , very simply and easily explained ; none of them having anything to do with you . No intention about them except of course the burglary and that was intentional as a burglary , but actually the fellow who shot at you was probably scared and nervous , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited again for a long moment or two , staring at his hands , and said : " On the other hand , if they are put all together . . . " He stopped .  | It was , of course , the accumulation . He said abruptly , out of the dusk : " Who would want to hurt you , Maggy ? " " Fen would n't , Bill . " " Fen ! Because of the money ? " " Would he ? " " No . No . I suppose that 's the only motive either of us can think of . Obviously , you do n't threaten anybody . If you are in any sort of position to have knowledge of dangerous international secrets , then you 've been leading a hidden life . " His tone was dry . " I suppose you could know something by accident . Something you do n't know that you know . Something that could be dangerous to somebody . How about that ? " She shook her head definitely . " Not me , Bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " frankly , I ca n't see you moving in circles of intrigue and carryings on  --  guns and jumping out of windows . Look here , what about that damned money ? What would happen to it if you  --  if Fen  --  what 's the legal word , if you predeceased Fen ? " His tone was so dry that if she had n't known him so well she would n't have heard its underlying urgency . What was to happen to the money ? If she obeyed Charles Brooke , she would n't tell Bill or Fen or anybody . On the other hand , it would never have occurred to Charles Brooke that danger ? murder  --  could by any conceivable chance approach her , even as a strongly improbable hypothesis . She said : " I 've made a will . " Bill jerked around toward her . " You 've what ? " " I signed a will . Yesterday . " " You made ... " He stopped . Finally he said : " Where is it ? " " In my handbag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have made a will in case someone murders you ! You ca n't believe that . . .. " " That was n't the reason . " " Oh , " Bill said . He lighted another cigarette , smoked for a moment and said : " I see , Uncle Charlie would have had all that planned . He would have had every i dotted and every t crossed . You do n't want to tell me about it , do you ? "  | " He wrote to me . He said I was n't to tell anybody anything . " " All right . You do n't have to ! " Bill said with a brusque , halfangry impatience . " But you can tell Russell Warner , ca n't you ? And you must give him your will . . . . " " I 'm going to , tomorrow . " " Give it to me . " " What ? " " I 'll give it to him . That is , " said Bill , still half-angrily , " if you think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her bedroom . She slipped the will out of her red handbag and brought it back to him . " Here it is . " " Okay . " He put it in his pocket . " I 'll get that to Russell the first thing in the morning . Then I 'll . . . " He stopped . " What , Bill ? ' What are you going to do ? " " Well , several things . Maybe I can talk to Russell . Do n't try to stop me , Maggy . You want this proved or disproved . I can talk to Bell .... " " Why Bell ? " " And Laura . To ask about  --  well , Maggy , if somebody is trying to murder you , there 's got to be a reason . They might know something . I can take a look at the woman that jumped . " " Bill ... " " If it 's anybody you know , or Fen knows , anybody close to you , then I 'm likely to know her , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to give the money to Fen , or do you want to keep it ? " " Oh , Bill , I do n't want it . It 's not mine . I have no right to it . Fen was his son .... " " Then give it to Fen . Get rid of it as fast as you can . Not that I think Fen 's trying to murder you . I do n't . But . . " Bill , " she said suddenly and urgently . " Did you borrow that money from Fen ? " " Money ! " " The twenty thousand that lie  --  he took .... " Bill said in a still , almost hushed voice : " Fen said that ? "  | " Yes , he . . . " She stopped . Something , a movement somewhere caught her eye and was gone . Then a shadow passed lightly over the rectangle of light that fell from the open door onto the tiled floor of the terrace . It flickered very lightly across it and was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was wearing the black silk negligee again . The long sweep of one sleeve as she lifted her arm to light a cigarette sent another fleeting winglike shadow fluttering across the path of light . How long had she been there ? What had she heard ? But their voices had been low ; she could n't have heard anything . Watching the graceful , black figure , Maggy said in a still lower voice , on an impulse : " Why did n't you want Sylvia to come here ? " Bill said promptly : " Because she likes Sloane . " " What ! " " M-hm , " Bill said , eyeing the lights . " She ca n't ! " " She does though . " " But Sloane ! " " And I do n't . " " But it was you I thought she  --  I heard her talking to you the morning before we went to the country and her voice ... " Bill 's face jerked around . " She did n't talk to me . " " She said ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stopped to put down a match and then came on and stood for a second peering at them before she came out on the terrace . " I thought I heard voices . Oh , it 's you , Bill dear . " She put her fingers lightly against his cheek as she passed him . It was a casualseeming gesture , yet with Sylvia , unusual , like her voice over the telephone , except her voice had been so frankly that of a woman in Iove and acknowledging it . In love with Sloane ? That seemed impossible . Besides , if it had been Sloane on the telephone , why would Sylvia have lied ? If it had been Fen , of course  --  Fen ? thought Maggy sharply . Yet Bill had said , promptly : Sylvia is in love with Sloane . Bill was pulling up a chair , saying in a way which gave no hint  | of an unwelcome interruption : " Headache better ? Here 's a chair . " " Thanks , darling . Oh , yes , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you ? Enough to give a girl a headache . " " Yes , we were talking of it . " " Oh , " Sylvia said . " Yes , well , with that last night and that dreadful thing the day before ... " " Accident , " Bill said . " Not nice , but  --  by the way , Maggy , " he turned to her , " I 've been wondering if that poor thing who jumped from the terrace did by any chance select this apartment to jump from , how do you suppose she got in the place ? Would Willy have let her in ? " " He was n't here . " " How about keys ? " Keys , of course . So simple ; so obvious . Nobody could open the door of an apartment without a key . Although somebody had opened the door and come into the apartment and smoked a cigarette in the dark , and taken a telephone call and pretended to be Maggy . She said slowly : " Father gave me a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Willy and there was an extra key downstairs in the office ; I 've got that one now . " Bill turned to Sylvia . " Willy 's all right , is n't he ? I mean he would n't have been likely to vent some private feud ? " " What on earth are you talking about ? " Sylvia said sharply . " You sound as if you think that woman was " ? there was a nervous , hard catch in her voice ? " was murdered . " " If you talk long enough , " Bill said easily , " you can get all the angles on every topic there is and still be talking . I 'd better go home . " Maggy did n't want him to go . She wanted him to tell her that there was no excuse for fear ; she wanted him to stay there , fending off the night , fending off the fancies that the night brought in again , as if the hovering black wings only waited his departure . She went to the door with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a word that Sylvia , leaning there in the doorway , smiling , would not have heard . Bill said , " Lock up after me . Bolt the doors . " He must have seen  | a quick flicker of alarm in her eyes for he grinned reassuringly . " Only so you 'll sleep better . Forget about burglars . " He said good night exactly as he 'd always said it , briefly and serenely , without even a look to remind her that now everything was different between them . He went away and the door closed and Maggy thought derisively to herself : what did I expect ? Passionate glances ? Oh , my darling Bill . Some time , some time soon it will be a final good-bye . She had n't , yet , made him believe that . She thought again : this is a faint prophecy of the way I 'll feel when he goes away forever , and was aware of Sylvia standing in the doorway , her face tired and white , her smile brilliant , her eyes observant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep below them that this time they could hear the deep rumble of the elevator and , after a second or two , its departure . They bolted the kitchen door and double locked the door of the foyer ; the paling gate was still locked ; they left the French doors open upon the cool night breeze . The thermos stood again on Maggy 's bed table . This time there was no faint smell of  --  well , of something like almonds . She had to be wrong . She began to feel a lifting of her spirits . She had told Bill and he had neither laughed at her nor seemed overly worried . He 'd been merely reasonable . She turned out the light and Bill telephoned . She felt for the extension in the dark and said : " Hello . " He said quickly into it : " Maggy , have you looked for her hand-bag ? " " Her  --  no . " " Then do it . Everywhere . Not now , but in the morning . Okay ? " " Oka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last words were so low she could barely hear them . The telephone clicked . Of course . Look for the handbag . Before the police looked for it . That was obvious too . It was obvious then ; it was also too late , for during the night someone ransacked the whole apartment , everywhere except Maggy 's room and Sylvia's.  | " ALL RIGHT , " said Maggy . " All right . Now I know it 's not another accident . It 's purposeful . Now I know somebody 's got a key . Now I know that somebody 's entered this apartment during the night . I 'm going to the police . " She said it aloud over the tray Willy brought her in the ransacked , wildly disordered library . Willy , agitated in his neat , white apron , his coat forgotten , moved his small brown hands together anxiously and looked with dismay around the cluttered heaps of books and moaned : " Thieves . " It was early . He had entered the kitchen , using his own key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dust and then , at once , to rouse her and report it . Thieves  --  but what was gone ? Nothing that she could see . So suppose what they wanted was only a handbag ! " Willy , could anybody , anybody have got your key last night and used it ? " " No , " Willy said , his sloe black eyes glittering . She looked at him . What did she know of Willy except that Sylvia had found him and he was , according to Sylvia , the only available cook in New York ? The question flashed across her consciousness and she was immediately ashamed of it . Willy knew it too and said with dignity : " If madam wishes to see my references , they are all in fine order , and I was at home last night with my wife and my two small children . " She retracted her thought promptly . Besides , someone had entered that apartment before she had ever heard of Willy and had sat there smoking , scribbling on the memorandum pad , pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry , Willy . " He understood it and bowed . A flicker of genuine friendliness as well as forgiveness for an unspoken slight flashed into his eyes . " Shall I call the police ? " " Yes , " she said and thought of the Brookes : Laura , Fen , herself , and the famous one , Charles Brooke . She took another swallow of coffee and said : " No , wait . " " Yes , madam , " said Willy after a thoughtful moment too , and by the knowing flicker in his eyes , seemed again to have followed her own line of reasoning . He said then : " The superintendent might be of some assistance . And madam 's lawyer . " he cleared his throat and added : " Before madam calls the police . " Probably she would n't have thought of the superintendent . She had thought of Russell Warner ; she reached for the telephone and called him then and there . Rather to her surprise he was already at his office . " Maggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decent hour to phone to you . What 's this about ? Well , Bill was here . He got me out of bed at the crack of dawn practically in order to meet him here and ? is this really your will ? " " Yes . " " Maggy , what possessed you to make a will ? I mean , it 's perfectly proper of course . Indeed , I would have told you to do so as soon as Charles ' will was properly probated and in effect , but  --  tell me , Maggy , how did you happen to do it ? " For an instant she did n't answer and he went on rather sharply : " Bill thinks that Charles told you to , that Charles may have dictated it and sent it in a letter to you . Is that right ? " So Bill had guessed the answer . She said with relief : " Yes , that 's right . " " Oh , " Russell said . She could almost see the sharpened shrewdness of his pink face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me what the provisions of it are ; so Charles must have told you not to . Your likely course would have been to bring it to me and you did n't ; so it 's clear that you  --  or Charles  --  did n't want me  | to know the contents . That 's all right , Maggy . Charles was too old and tried a friend of mine for me to question his reason for that , and besides " ? he sighed a little ? " of course I know what his reason was . I 'm fond of Fen . I realize what a problem he 's been to his father , but obviously Charles thought that owing to my affection for Fen , I might advise you against being too strongly influenced by a death-bed wish . They 're not always sound , you know , or just ; a dying man does not as a rule think clearly . You need n't answer me . I take it that this will cuts off Fen altogether , in case of your predeceasing him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she said nothing , he went on : " You may wish to change it later ; we 'll see . In the meantime I 've put it in the vault here . Maggy , I had a short talk with Bill , but a rather " ? he cleared his throat ? " disturbing one . I ca n't believe . . . " He coughed again and said : " On the other hand , of course , it is really a very large estate . A temptation to anyone . Why did you telephone to me ? " She told him . There was a long silence on the other end of the telephone . Finally he said : " Well , I 'd better send a girl up to make an inventory and send it to Laura . She may be able to tell from it if anything 's missing . But if it was the handbag  --  although I ca n't believe it was " ? he stopped again and thought and said abruptly ? " I 'm afraid , by the way , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , Maggy . Ca n't be avoided . Aside from everything else , it 's your civic duty . But I 'll go with you , Maggy . " " What about calling the police ? " " There ! " he cried horrified . " Now ? Oh , my dear , I would n't do that . No , I strongly advise against that . I 'm sure Laura would n't like it and with Charles so recently dead and so well known and ? no , no . Be advised by me , Maggy , and do n't call them . If it seems necessary  --  later . . . " He coughed and said : " Not now . But is there anything I can do for you , my dear ? " She thanked him and said no . Probably , she thought , finishing her coffee , he was right . In any case , Bill had talked to him . She did n't know how much or how little he had told the lawyer or how much or how little had seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed its former friendliness and  | warmth , so at least he no longer half-suspected Maggy of having sought to influence Charles Brooke in the making of his will . Five minutes later the superintendent rang and Willy ushered him in . She went directly to the point . " Someone , " she said as the superintendent looked with dismay at the ransacked and frantically disheveled room , " has entered this apartment at least twice that I know of . Perhaps other times without my knowledge . It 's got to stop . " " Yes ! Yes ! " The superintendent looked around him again . " It 's dreadful . Burglars ? What did they get ? " " I do n't know . I ca n't tell . We 'll have to ask Miss Brooke . How could anybody get in ? " He shrugged rather helplessly and did not reply . " Who has keys to this apartment besides myself ? " He considered and said slowly : " Do you mind if I sit down , Mrs , Brooke ? That horrible business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He sank down on the sofa and looked around him and clicked his tongue against his teeth . " Dreadful ! I 'm thankful Miss Brooke ca n't see this . " " I 've got a key , " Maggy said . " Willy , the cook , has a key . Are there any others ? " " Well , now , that I do n't know . Miss Brooke was always a little offhand about things . Not careless exactly , but forgetful . " Feather-brained , Charles had always said . Maggy said : " Can you find out from the elevator boys or the girl at the desk if they saw anyone come up here last night ? " He brightened . " Oh , yes , that 's simple . After midnight , that is . The girl at the desk goes home at twelve and the main door is locked . Anyone entering after that has to be let in by the man in charge . He opens the door and takes anyone up in the elevator ? after he 's locked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man on duty from then until six-thirty in the morning . Nothing is easier than to check that . I can find out right now . " She took him to the telephone and then went into her own room . She did n't see how anyone could have entered her room during the night without her knowledge ; still it might have happened  | and the only things of value that she had were in the red handbag . They were still there : a sapphire bracelet Charles Brooke had given her for a wedding present , the huge star sapphire which Fen had given her , a small broach , old-fashioned and delicate , that had belonged to her mother and grandmother . She looked in her billfold and so far as she could remember , the roll of bills there was intact too . The letter from Charles Brooke was untouched in the zipper compartment . As she put the bag down , Sylvia having just awakened , came to the door . " What on earth ? " She rubbed her eyes and looked at Maggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggy told her briefly . " Again ? " cried Sylvia . " What did they get ? Really , Maggy ... " She followed Maggy back into the living room where the superintendent said sadly and worriedly that no one , positively no one , had come in the apartment during the previous night who was not known to the man on duty , and he had brought no one to the twenty-first floor . " Somebody was here , " Maggy said . It was an impasse . The superintendent looked around the room and sighed . Sylvia , still white and hollow-eyed , moved a cushion from the floor to the sofa and sank down upon it . Willy hovered in the dining-room doorway . It was his hovering figure that reminded Maggy of a small impression , unnoted at the time , now perhaps important . She said : " What about the back way ? What about the service elevator ? It 's automatic , is n't it ? Willy said he came up in it himself . " The superintendent looked at her with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the delivery door at the back , yes , and the delivery desk for parcels stays open till midnight . Anybody could walk in there , I suppose , at any time . Nobody would be likely to notice . And it would be more difficult , but probably somebody could get into the service elevator and bring himself up .... " I did , " said Willy , " with groceries . "  | " ... but , " the superintendent 's ray of hope vanished , " not after midnight . That door is closed and locked then , too . " " If that woman , the woman in black , jumped from this terrace , she had to get into the apartment somehow . She had to have a key . " Maggy 's voice was queer and taut in her own ears . " Oh , yes . " The superintendent sighed again . " Or if anybody came up with her , he had to have a key . " The superintendent looked startled . " Surely you 're not suggesting  --  My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone came in here the day I arrived and sat here and smoked a cigarette .... " " Mrs. Brooke ... " " And went away . The cigarette was still smoking when I found it . " " But that  --  no , it 's impossible . It 's  --  my dear Mrs. Brooke . " He went hurriedly to the door . " This is dreadful . This is not permitted . I assure you I 'll investigate . Please be patient . Please ... " Maggy went to the door with him . When she came back , Sylvia was in the library , picking up books and shoving them anyhow into the gaping shelves . " We may as well make a start , " she said and dusted off her hands and scooped up another armload . Willy came with Sylvia 's breakfast tray and put it on the table . Sylvia dusted off her fingers again , sat down , and shook out her napkin . Maggy left Sylvia drinking orange juice and went to the bedroom to telephone Bill . She 'd tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask him what he had said to Russel Warner , and what Russell had said to him . She 'd ask him if he had seen the woman in black . Bill was not at his club and he was not at the office . She gave her name and Laura 's telephone number to a pleasant-voiced girl in his office . " Please ask him to phone to me when he comes in . " " Yes , of course , Mrs. Brooke . " It was , curiously after that , a very quiet day . Bill did not telephone ; indeed , the telephone did not ring once that moaning , although she listened for it with a growing sense of  | tension . Surely as soon as Bill saw the woman in black , he would tell her , one way or the other , his conclusion . She and Sylvia made a rather cursory clearing of the apartment . Willy helped them , silently . After lunch , at Sylvia 's urging , they went to a style show . " Nothing like a fashion show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , " she said rather tartly . " Come on , Maggy . Oh , by the way , I forgot to tell you , I 've a dinner date tonight I ca n't get out of . I do n't like to leave you alone . I 'm sorry . " " Oh , it 's all right , Sylvia . " " I may be late , but ... " " Ring when you come home . I 'll be awake . " She did not want to leave the telephone , but she did not want to stay alone in the apartment either . She put on a street dress and went to the fashion show with Sylvia . But in the middle of watching slim , tall models stroll with lilting hauteur , and furs , and jewels , and gowns that were breathtakingly rich and lovely , Maggy thought : the telephone in Laura 's room is an extension . Sylvia , Willy , anybody in the apartment , could have heard Bill tell me last night to try to find that handbag . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The model then passing , wrapped in blue-brown mink over emerald silk , with diamonds at her ears and her blonde hair smooth and high , turned at Maggy 's involuntary motion and revolved slowly before them . Sylvia whispered : " Oh , Maggy , are you going to buy it ? Maggy , do you realize that you can have anything here that you want ! " Her brilliant smile was the same ; her clear light eyes bright with admiration . Why would Sylvia want that handbag ? Obviously , she would n't . The model strolled on . Maggy looked at her watch . She 'd telephone again to Bill at five when presumably his office would be about to close . Perhaps he had called her during the afternoon . They separated after the fashion show . " I'vc got an errand or two , " Sylvia said , " and then I 'll go straight on to dinner . I'rn not going to change . "  | She went along downtown , her slender figure erect , her black hat in her hand . Maggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a cool breeze freshening the city , and the shadows of the buildings were blue across the pavements . The usual , everyday safety of the street , the shop windows , the stream of pedestrians , even the smells of motor exhaust and the tooting of taxis , was reassuring . How could anything in that everyday world threaten her , Maggy Brooke ? She walked slowly , stopping to look in the windows . The things that had happened , had , of course , happened ; but suppose that none of them really concerned her . Suppose at the worst , she had merely happened to exist on the fringe of some circumstance , some tragic story of which the woman in black was the center , and yet which had nothing to do with her really , or Laura , or anybody she knew ; and at the best , she had been by chance an observer in a set of coincidences , most of them without any possible significance . It began to seem possible . The important events of those few days were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bill . Those were important and concerned her , but nothing else . She reached the cross street below Laura 's apartment and looked up as she had when coming from the airport with Bill ( so long a time ago , so short a time ) and saw the green fringe of the hedge waving in the fresh breeze against the sky . There were no messages for her when she inquired at the receptionist 's desk . But when she reached Laura 's penthouse and Willy came to meet her , he said that the police had been there and searched the place . " Did they find anything ? " she asked after a moment . " Yes , " Willy said . " A hat . " " A  --  what ? " They had found a hat and had taken it away ; they had found it ? he led her back to Sylvia 's room to show her . It had been stuffed in among the tubes and wires of the little ivory-colored radio there . The back had been removed and then replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hat ? " Willy made a gesture with his hands . " Black , with a white ribbon on it . Small . It was very crushed , of course . " A woman in black , elderly , wearing a hat . A black hat , almost certainly . She said : " What are they going to do with it ? " Willy shrugged . He did n't know . But they had left a message for Maggy . They 'd like her to look at the dead woman and someone would call for Maggy at ten the next morning . " Thank you . Did Mr. Sanderson phone ? " " Mr. Sanderson ? No , madam . " Neither , it developed had Lawtie telephoned so apparently there were no new developments in that investigation . Police , she thought : police in the country ; police here ; police tomorrow morning . Why had they taken the hat ? That of course was clear . How it had got in the radio was not so clear . It was Sylvia 's room , the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had every opportunity to search the apartment , to find  --  a hat . Why ? And someone else , of course ( if the woman in black had been murdered ) , would have had an opportunity to hide the hat while she and Sylvia were at lunch . After awhile she telephoned Bill 's of ice and it was closed . She telephoned his club and he had not come in . She had dinner alone again and made herself listen to the radio and read the evening papers , and in the middle of the editorials , thought : suppose by any chance I do recognize that woman ! Or suppose Bill had recognized her ! She had not , somehow , until then realized the importance of the dead woman 's identification , or how much it would prove or disprove . Time passed and Bill did not telephone or come . Neither , she thought , suddenly , had Fen . " When you 've come to your senses , " he 'd said , " let me know . " At nine o'clock Willy left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which nevertheless sounded rather clear , obtruding  | itself firmly between her and the newspaper . It was immediately very quiet in the apartment . The small clatter of china and silver from the kitchen had been rather nice to hear  --  a reassuring , homely sound . Still listening for the telephone , she went to the kitchen and bolted the door and windows ; she came back and the gilt-framed mirror reflected her in the thin black dress , with its long rustling skirt that she 'd worn that afternoon . August black , she thought , and went on to double lock the door leading from the penthouse to the outside corridor , and then to try the paling gate on the terrace . It was still securely locked . She came back to the living room . Certainly now no one could enter the penthouse . She wished that Bill would telephone . She prowled the apartment . She picked up books and put them down . Eventually she went out to the terrace and settled herself in the chair where she 'd sat with Bill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . The beacon on Radio City turned and turned shooting its long ray up amid clouds and , still , Bill did not telephone . The night was cooler , with a breeze that shook the awning gently . The sky , however , was overcast . Except for a patch of light that fell on the floor of the terrace from the open door behind her , the shadows under the awning were heavy , mingling hedges , shrubbery , trees altogether in formless obscurity . Gradually the city grew quiet ; gradually the slow-revolving beacon became preeminent , became increasingly important in a darkened world , almost hypnotic . Her eyes grew weary , watching it ; she turned her head . A man stood in the dense shadow of the shrubbery just beyond the door . She could see the rigid black outline of his feet and the dim gleam of a highlight upon polished leather . He did not know that she had seen him . He was on the other side of the open door . The tubs and the shrubbery must conceal his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe leather . She must not let him know that she had seen it . She must slide out of the chair , in through the door in one swift movement , giving  | him no warning . Her heart was pounding . She tightened her hands around the arms of the chair . The gleam of light reflected on leather vanished . And the door buzzer sounded sharply and shrilly . She slid out of her chair and through the lighted doorway . She fled across the lighted living room and foyer to the door and wrenched it open . Fen stood there , smiling .  | HE CAME in and closed the door behind him . She moved back , hard against the table . But whoever it was on the terrace , it was n't Fen . So she 'd been wrong , wrong to question him , but right to deny her own questions . She took a gulping breath , half vast and grateful relief , half terror , and cried : " Somebody 's out there . . . " Somebody . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " He did n't understand her . His eyes were blue and bright and blank . " Why , of course . Sylvia ... " " No , no , Sylvia 's not here ! " " She is here . She said she was coming . " " You do n't understand . I tell you someone ... " He said , coming a step nearer her , harshly : " She 's got to be here . She would n't lie to me . Where is she ? " " Fen , listen to me . I tell you it 's somebody else . He was in the shadow . He was moving , he  --  then you rang ... " He understood then and pushed past her into the living room where she followed him , where he looked around , this way , that way , jerkily , hurriedly , and then ran to the terrace . She remembered the switch and found it and lights sprang up . There were shrubs waving in the breeze but only shrubs , small trees , leafy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tubs they stood in , unable to move from their own shadow . Fen ran to the end of the terrace ; he tried the paling gate and it was still locked . He ran back toward her , his hair ruffled by the breeze , his face pallid in that feeble , eerie light from the brackets above his head .  | " Where is she ? " " It was n't Sylvia . It was someone else .... He 's got to be here . " He looked at her blankly , brightly , for a moment , and said : " There 's no one here . " There was n't , of course . Away off somewhere below , a car honked . Fen said , catching his breath , unevenly : " Where was he ? " " There , " she said and pointed to that thick clump of shrubs which was not now very thick , which was not dense , which had no power of motion whatever except what the night breeze gave it . Fen looked and said : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Shoes ! " " Just standing there . " " Then  --  then he 's in the apartment , somewhere . " It had to be that . Whoever had stood on the terrace , watching , stalking her from the concealing shadow , must be in the apartment , hiding , until Fen should leave and she would be alone again . There was no other escape from the terrace . She cried : " I 'll telephone downstairs . I 'll call the police .... " " Do n't be a fool , " cried Fen and ran into the library . Through the penthouse then , into every room , every closet . Did something slink along after them , barely out of sight ? They reached Sylvia 's room with its crisp red and white , with Sylvia 's bright little toilet things on the dressing table . Fen turned and looked at her . " She said she 'd be here . She said she was coming back .... " She had turned on the overhead light and in its harsh downward glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . He 'd bitten his lip so it was bleeding . He reached out suddenly and snatched up Sylvia 's dressing case which stood on a table and , to Maggy 's stunned horror , smashed it to the floor . " Fen ! " She knelt down in the bright dainty little room with Sylvia 's things all around them , her black dressing gown across the bed , her perfume everywhere , her shining cosmetics , and gathered up the dressing case and put it on the dressing table . She moved a bottle of mercurochrome in order to do so . It was a bright , gay red ,  | the color of Sylvia 's smile . She turned to Fen . " What has Sylvia done ? What has happened ? " What has happened to you , she was going to say , and the telephone rang . Fen heard it and stiffened and said : " There she is . You answer it . Find out where she is . " But where was the man who had stood on the terrace ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to life , on black wings . Wearing polished shoes . The telephone demanded her to answer it . She ran to Laura 's bedroom , lighting up every corner , dispelling every faint shadow in the room . She took down the receiver , her eyes on the doorway , her breath coming in gulps . It was long distance from Philadelphia . Bill 's voice came on . " Maggy .. " " Yes , oh , yes , Bill ... " His voice quickened . " What 's the matter ? What 's happened ? You sound as if  --  are you all right ? " " Mere was somebody  --  here on the terrace ... " " Who ? " " I do n't know . He 's gone . We searched ... " " You and Sylvia ? " " No . Fen . He came just then . We 've searched everywhere . He 's gone . " " Are you sure you saw somebody ? " " Yes , yes . I  --  I saw his shoes . " He said as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light . I could n't see him . He . . . Bill , what shall I do ? " There was a pause ; then he said , " Is Fen still there ? " " Oh , yes . It just happened . " " Well , then , lock the place . Bolt the doors . Where 's Sylvia ? " " She 's not back yet . She will be soon . " " Well , then , listen , Maggy , I 've got to talk fast . I 've talked to Russell Warner . We both talked to Henry Bell in London . Bell says Uncle Charlie sent Fen a cable the afternoon you left London ; he dictated the cable and in it he told Fen the agreement you and Uncle Charlie reached . . . . " " Yes , I know . Fen knew about it . . .  | " But he says that Uncle Charlie sent another cable to somebody the next day . He sent it after he 'd written the letter to you , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and used the phone himself , there at his bed table . Do you know anything of that cable ? " " No . Who . . . ? " " Russell thinks and I think Uncle Charlie 's letter gave you very exact instructions . Is that right ? " " Yes . Yes . " " All right . Show it to Fen . " " No , I ca n't . He said not to . He said ... " After a second , Bill said : " Darling , I 'm sure now that I love you . If I did n't , I 'd bash you on the bean , myself . Dead men 's wishes are not that sacred . Not when it 's  --  I 've got to hurry . Show Fen the letter . " " But ... " Bill swore . The operator said : " Your time is up . Signal when through . " He shouted : " Do n't cut me off ! Wait ! Maggy  --  show the letter to Fen . " She knew , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . She sat down slowly on the bed , fumbling her way through unspoken inferences . That letter from Charles Brooke would remove , so far as Fen was concerned , a motive . If Fen had made attempts to murder her , the letter would automatically stop any further attempts . She knew now that it was n't Fen ; that waiting shadow of a man had been on the terrace . When Fen in the outside corridor rang the bell . Something was happening at the other end of the line . Bill seemed to be talking to someone in a quick aside she could not hear . There was the rapid murmur of voices , nothing distinct , and all at once utter and complete silence . She spoke into the telephone ; she called him ; she jiggled the receiver . Eventually an operator 's voice said : " Your party has rung off . "  | " No , No ! Ca n't you reach him again ? Please , operator ... " " I 'm sorry , madam . It was from a toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final convincing sound of the dial tone . She put down the receiver slowly . ' What had happened ? Had Bill meant to ring off like that , so abruptly without telling her where he was , what he was doing , why ? Well of course she knew where he was , the operator had distinctly said Philadelphia . Where a dead woman , wearing black , had once stopped at a department store , as the label of the store marked her clothing . There was a movement at the door and she jerked around . Fen stood there wiping his face , looking more like himself . He said : " Well  --  what did she say ? " " It was n't Sylvia . It was Bill . " He put his handkerchief away . His pallor , his look of queer , baffled fury had gone . " What did Bill want ? " " To talk , " she said . And got up and went to her red handbag where she 'd left it on the table . She 'd do what Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She got out the letter from the little zippered envelope inside the red bag and turned . " It 's your father 's letter , " she said steadily , looking at him . " Read it , Fen . " His eyebrows lifted a little . He took it , gave her a questioning look of mild surprise at her tone , she supposed , or at something portentous and theatrical in the gesture with which she held the letter toward him . And then he moved under the light . He read it slowly . They had turned on the overhead lights there too and there was no shadow , no change of expression that she could not have seen in his handsome , boyish face . " I see , " he said . " I  --  I could n't help it , Fen . I did n't know it . " " No . No , I suppose not . " " I 'm sorry , Fen . " He quoted : " Fen is not to have one cent of it . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Well , " Fen said . " And did you sign the will ? "  | She nodded . His face was stonily white under the glaring lights ; his eyes brilliant and blue ; his hand doubled up into a white knuckled fist . He was trying , she thought , to control himself , to bite back any bitter and accusing words . " Oh , Fen , " she cried . " It was wrong . It was cruel .... " He looked away from her , all around the room , with careful , examining fixity of attention on this cushion , that curtain , anything . She said : " It was wrong of him , Fen . It was n't fair . But I 'm going to change it somehow . I 'm going to ... " " He 's always been on your side . " " Fen " It was why we could never have a showdown  --  you and I , never talk things out . He was always on your side . " " Fen , not It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " Does Russell Warner know this ? " " Yes . That is , he has n't seen the letter . He guessed ... " " Oh , " Fen said . " Oh . So he knows ... " All at once he seemed to have won his pitiful struggle for selfcontrol ; the look of stony pallor left his face . He even smiled a little , his eyes now meeting her own . " He did n't want me to know . Father , I mean . That was a test . Like him , is n't it ? Not very flattering . He thought I would  --  straighten up for love of the money . He thought I 'd come back to you for that  --  instead of for you . " " I wish you could have seen him before he died . I wish you could have talked to him . " " It 's funny , is n't it ? Ironical . I was here at that very time almost , asking you to come back to me . Promising anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not for any other reason . And at the very hour , he must have been writing that . " It was ironical . " I wish he 'd known that , Fen . " Fen lifted his shoulders . " It 's done now . There 's nothing we can do about it . The money 's yours to do with as you please . But Maggy , please remember , I asked you to come back to me before I knew this . Now that I 've read this letter , I realize that I ca n't ask you again . How can you be sure it 's you I want , not the money ?  | How can I be sure it 's me you want , and not some sense of duty to me or to my father that might bring you back to me ? " " It was unfair , " she said . " It was n't right . " He got up abruptly . " Maggy , are you sure there was some body on the terrace ? Because if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People ca n't vanish into thin air . I 'll ask them if they 've seen anybody at the desk downstairs . " He swung out the door toward the kitchen and the house telephone . The letter rustled as she replaced it in her handbag . Your father would be proud of you , Russell Warner had said to Fen when he had told him of the main portions of the will . Charles Brooke would not only have been proud of Fen then , he 'd have seen how mistaken he was and how unfair to the boy he loved . Fen had taken it without shrinking , with scarcely even a word of reproach . There had not been any question in her mind as to her decision . In fact , there was no decision for her to make ; she had no choice . Charles Brooke 's death had settled that . She may as well tell Fen now that she was coming back to him . The cool night breeze had whipped itself up to a gusty wind , light but strong , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her thin black dress . She went to the closet and pulled out a little red jacket ; in its pocket , dangling , was a white silk scarf . She put the jacket around her shoulders . It would be in truth the remaking of marriage vows , except this time , she was an adult ; Fen was an adult . There was never to be any change or retreat . She would never permit herself to look back . So this is good-bye , Bill , she thought , and went quickly into the hall . She had forgotten the curious little scene in Sylvia 's room until she saw Fen coming through the dining room , and then it flashed into her memory and away again like distant lightning . Fen was white and excited . He cried : " Maggy , you were right . There was somebody on the terrace ! The girl at the desk says the elevator boy brought a man down from the twenty-first floor only a few minutes ago . And she says there are only two other apartments up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenants are away . So he must have come from here . Now what in the hell did he want and who was it ? And how did he get away from us ? " But whoever it was , it was not Fen . She looked at him , thinking that and seeing herself reflected dimly beyond him in the minor , the flicker of her black dress , the red slash of her jacket . The buzzer at the door sounded . Both of them jerked around toward it . Someone walked into the foyer and into the library , and seeing them , stopped . It was Sloane Pickering . He said : " Hello . The door was open so I walked in . " For a moment the three of them stood like marionettes , unmoving , unable to move , reflected in the glass wall . Then Fen stepped forward jerkily , his hands doubled into fists like white rocks . " So it was you , " he cried . " That door was closed . I tried it . You 've got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace ! You followed Maggy inside and hid somewhere here in the apartment and got away while we were searching the place ! I might have guessed it was you . I might have known . But you ca n't get the money , Sloane . Not a cent of it . Even if you 'd killed Maggy the money would n't come to me . So you ca n't take that away from me , too . You ca n't get your filthy little yellow hands on that , ever . " Sloane did not move . The light shone on his plastered , danklooking hair , his high cheekbones . His hands were in the pockets of his lounge coat , too wide across the shoulders , too bulky for his thin body . He looked hollow and emaciated and subtly seedy in spite of his elegance . He said in a voice as flat as his glistening cheekbones , as flat as his plastered hair : " I do n't know what you 're talking about . "  | FEN 'S VOICE rose . " You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in without a key ! You were here ; you were on the terrace . You think if you kill Maggy , then I 'll have the money and then . . . You and Sylvia ! You think you can do anything with me . You think that I 'm so much in love with Sylvia that I 'd be an easy mark . A sucker . You and Sylvia ! How were you going to get money out of me ? Had you planned for me to marry Sylvia ? It 's a joke on you ! A joke on Sylvia . Pretending it 's me , when it 's been you all along . I see it now . But the joke is there 'd be no money ! " Fen was laughing on a high , hysterical note . Something was buzzing in the kitchen ; Fen caught his breath and said , his blue eyes on Sloane : " That must be Sylvia ! Answer it , Maggy . " Her black skirt swished as she went in the kitchen . It was the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Mrs. Brooke , I 'm so sorry . The same man has just gone up again . To your floor , I mean . The same one that went up earlier , before Mr. Brooke came . I was back in the office and I did n't see him , and one of the boys took him up . He told the boy he 'd been announced , but he was n't . Mrs. Brooke , I mean , I did n't even see him . " Maggy moistened her lips . " Are you sure it was the same man ? " " Yes . That 's twice he 's gone up to your floor and he got past me both times . I am so sorry ! " " ' hank you . It 's all right ... " She started back to the dining room and then stopped in the dim silence of the pantry , struck with the force of that revelation .  | Sloane on the terrace , waiting in the shadow for a chance to murder her . His motive was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suspected it and denied it until he could deny it no longer . Once the Brooke money was in Fen 's hands , Sloane had expected Fen to be an easy prey . That was Sloane 's plan . Probably it would have been successful . He had the authority of a wily , hard , gutter rat ( fighting for its life , fighting with teeth and ruthlessness ) over a younger , far weaker nature . Fen had never had to fight for anything . Once she was out of the way and Fen had the Brooke money  --  Sloane 's day would come . The rats would gather . Sloane . And Sylvia ! She steadied herself with one hand on the cool metal surface of a pantry table . She could not believe in Sylvia 's complicity in any scheme , either with Fen or Sloane . Yet Bill had said she liked Sloane . And Fen 's rage when he found that Sylvia was not at home could have been a jealous rage . Suddenly small signals stood out as if illuminated , Fen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaded him . If Fen were in love with Sylvia , if Sloane had proposed to profit thereby , much would be explained . Certainly she , Maggy , determined to carry out Charles Brooke 's demands , was a barrier to any such plan . Stubborn , Fen had called her . She must be wrong . Sylvia could not have intentionally entered upon anything so ugly , anything so dangerous . The only certainty was that Sloane was the man on the terrace . And if Fen 's accusations were in any degree accurate then the simplicity of Sloane 's plan was devilish and appalling . Fen , married perhaps to Sylvia , the prey of both of them . That was why it had to be murder . Sloane had known that from the first . The Brooke money had been left to Maggy with no conditions ; if she had divorced Fen , she could have taken all the money with her . In Sloane 's language , in his psychology , once she had all the money in her possession she would never give it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sloane had urged her to go back to Fen , of course , so he could arrange a more leisurely , a more successful accident .  | As he had almost done when , at Sloane 's suggestion  --  at Sylvia 's urging she had gone to the deserted , lonely country house . How quickly Sloane had pounced upon the chance by which she invited Sylvia to stay with her ; with what ruthless swiftness he had turned that chance to his own uses . She must get back to Fen . Anger rose so strong and swift that she had no fear . He was a rat and she and Fen could deal with him together , as a rat deserves to be dealt with . She opened the door . To her astonishment , the two men were sitting calmly in the living room , Sloane at ease on the sofa , Fen on the edge of an arm-chair . Fen looked up and said : " Was it Sylvia ? " " No . It was the girl downstairs . . . . " Her voice shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too smart and too big for him , his plastered hair gleaming , half-smiling , had tried to kill her ! With utter self-possession Sloane said : " I did n't have her announce me . I expect that 's it . " " What have you done with Sylvia ? " Fen demanded . It sounded like a repetition , as if he 'd asked it many times . " Fen , I have n't done anything with Sylvia . She 's free , white , and over twenty-one . I had dinner with her , yes , but ... " Fen shot up , his fists doubled up again , his eyes blue and bright . " You lie ! She said she was coming back here . . . . " He stopped , aware of his own inconsistency . Sloane dug his hands deeper in the great pockets that were too big , and shrugged . Fen stared down at him and suddenly a flush came up over his boyish face . He sat down with the effect of collapse on the footstool . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her away from me . I thought you were my friend . You said you were ? you said I could trust you . You said  --  and then Sylvia  --  Sylvia Maggy went to him . " Fen , do n't . . . Fen ... " Sloane got up in a single , lithe motion . A rat , thought Maggy , with beady eyes and sleek hair . Sloane came toward Fen and  | she moved too , quickly , closer to Fen . Sloane did not look at her . He said , looking down at Fen 's bent fair head : " You 'd better come with me . " " No , " Maggy said . Sloane still did not look at her . " Come on , Fen . " " I 'll not let him go , " she said . Sloane at last looked at her . His small eyes were leisurely , quiet , controlled , as if he knew exactly what he was going to do , what she could do and could n't do . He had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know when you 're well off , Maggy . " " He 's not going with you . " Sloane looked at her easily , sure of himself . " Oh , I think he will . " He was so sure of himself that that too frightened her . She turned , snatching at Fen 's shoulder , shaking him . " Fen , tell him you wo n't . Tell him you 're through with him . Tell him ... " Sloane said easily : " Fen 's a friend of mine . I 'm a faithful and loyal friend of his . He knows that . " Maggy spun around . " You  --  you . . . " Suddenly she thought : but he did n't believe Fen about the money ; once he believes he 'll give up . She cried : " Fen told you the truth about the money . It 's mine and no matter what happens to me , ever , it 'll still not be Fen 's . He told you the truth . I 've made a will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll not have it . You need n't have tried to murder me . " She was trembling so she could hardly speak ; she cried : " He 's through with you ! He knows now what you are ! " Sloane was suddenly listening ; his face was rigid . " Is that the truth ? " " Ask Russell Warner if you do n't believe me . Ask Fen . Ask Sloane looked down at Fen . " Okay , " he said softly , after a moment . " Okay . If that 's the way it is . But you 'd better come along , Fen . " His face was sleek and yellowish white ; his eyes beady , yet opaque ; he looked down at Fen and added softly : " You want to see Sylvia , do n't you ? "  | " Fen , " cried Maggy and stopped , for Fen shook off her hand . He lifted a face as clear , as youthful , as natural , as if there were not still the bright red flush in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his forehead . " I think I 'll go with Sloane , Maggy . " " I 'll not let you . " Fear had entered the room . She pushed it away from her as if it had indeed a presence . " Fen , do n't you see he 's a murderer ! That woman  --  that woman in black  --  he must have murdered her . I 'm going to see her in the morning ; I 'm going with the police . I 'll know then . I 'll know who she is and why he murdered her . " The words flung themselves out into the room as if she really had known all the things she claimed , as if she had no doubt , no questions . Actually , for that moment , she had none . There was a silence in the lovely room . Then Fen said : " I 'll be going , Maggy . " He started across the room , his blond head up . Sloane did not look at her ; he did not even trouble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she saw his small bony hand slide quietly from his pocket and touch Fen 's elbow , guiding him lightly . " Fen , your father . . . " cried Maggy despairingly , running across the room , bringing up against the arm of the sofa , clinging to it as the door from the foyer opened , and , after a second , closed . Oh , Fen , she thought presently , oh , Fen . So a man might walk off a cliff his eyes open , his need for self-destruction too great for his weak will to conquer . And so might she have watched it at a distance , powerless to stop it . Sylvia . He loved her so much , so tragically , so fatefully . Why ? But it is never possible to say why a man loves a woman , how he loves her , what it does to him . Poor Fen ; how much it explained . The clock ticked lightly and clearly ; it was the only sound in the apartment . Maggy got up and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pausing , another few steps . Sylvia wanted money , Sylvia loved money and the things that money brought . So , therefore Fen thought he had to have it , had to beg Maggy to aoa  | come back to him , because she , Maggy , had the money . They had told him that there was n't any other way for Fen to get it . Suddenly she stopped . Sloane had been frightened when she 'd talked of the woman in black ! He 'd been frightened . So they had that card to play in Fen 's defense . She 'd tell Bill , she 'd tell Russell Warner . They would save Fen from them in spite of himself . But then , of course , Sloane had no need for Fen since Fen would n't have the money . And Sylvia .. . It was Sloane Sylvia had talked to , that day she overheard an incomplete conversation , her voice low and warm and caressing ! Sloane , not Bill , not Fen . Telling Sloane that it was dangerous ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to murder her ? Yet Sylvia had seemed frightened herself , terrified . Why not ? Murder . The little wall clock ticked and ticked as lightly as if time meant nothing . It struck once or twice and Maggy heard it and did not hear it , but it must have been two hours later when Sylvia came . The door buzzer sounded and Maggy , knowing what she was going to do , went to answer it . Sylvia , her hat in hand , came in . And said : " You 've got to come with me . " " Fen 's in love with you . " " Oh , that does n't matter . You 've got to come .... " " He loves you . You 're everything to him . And you and Sloane built your ugly little scheme on that . " " Maggy ! " Sylvia put down her hat with a kind of desperate resolution , her face looked like death itself , it was so white and rigid . Only her lips flamed red and gay as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't understand . I did n't ... " " Fen gave you that bracelet . It is n't paste , it 's real . He stole the money to pay for it , and you let him .... " " Maggy " You want the Brooke money . You and Sloane . You were going to marry Fen if you had to , to get the money . Fen would  | have given you anything you wanted . And you 'd have seen to it that Sloane ... " " Maggy ! You 've got to listen to me ! " " You and Sloane . You were playing for him , stalking him , tracking him down like  --  like animals , " said Maggy in a queer cold voice . " Like rats . . . " Sylvia said , unexpectedly : " Oh , yes . Sloane 's a gutter rat . Yes . " She sighed and lifted her shoulders . " All right . If you 've got to talk . But it 's dangerous . . . " She glanced around and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move , into the living room . She sank down into a chair and eyed Maggy . The shadows under her clear , light eyes were enormous . She looked ill , as if she 'd had a long sickness . She reached for a cigarette and lighted it with steady , lovely white hands and diamonds and aquamarines glittered on her wrist . She noted Maggy 's glance and said : " Yes , Fen gave it to me . I really did n't know though that he 'd got the money that way . I thought he had all he wanted . Charles Brooke was so rich . . . . " She shrugged . " I thought it did n't matter to Fen and it  --  you 'd have to be without money for a long time to understand . Without any money at all , Maggy , keeping up appearances . . . " She gave a short laugh . " You 'd have to do all that , you 'd have to know that probably you 'd keep on doing it all your life , Maggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " She turned the bracelet on her wrist and looked at it . " Something so  --  so lavish , Maggy , so beautiful . So wildly extravagant . Something you could sell for meals  --  and wo n't , " Sylvia said , setting her teeth into her lower lip . She waited a second , and lifted her lovely eyes to meet Maggy 's . " I 'd have starved , I think , before I 'd have sold it . It meant all the things I did n't have . And then , " she said abruptly , coolly , and conversationally , " you did n't really seem to care much about Fen . I asked you about Joan Greenfield , remember ? I knew then that you were n't in love with Fen ; so I was n't really taking anything from you . And you had so much . She paused and shook ashes from her cigarette . " Every time I saw that great roll of bills that meant  --  just nothing to you  --  every time I saw  --  oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ! This afternoon at the fashion show , you could have had anything you wanted there , Maggy . " She leaned forward . " Do n't you see ? It was n't as if you 'd been in love with Fen . " Maggy said : " You do n't love him , Sylvia . " For the first time Sylvia seemed to flinch . She drew back a little , her white eyelids lowered ; she ground out the cigarette suddenly and got to her feet . " All right . I wanted Fen , yes . Taking him away from Joan was easy . He fell in love with me , and then  --  he introduced me to Sloane . No , I never loved Fen . You ca n't control that exactly , Maggy . You ... " " Sloane , " Maggy said . " How can you love him ! " Sylvia 's black , neat head nodded once . " It 's queer , is n't it ? Sloane is not what I 'd have ever thought I 'd want . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscrupulous . IIe  --  I 've still got friends , you know , people Sloane wants to use  --  this way , that way , however he can " ? her mouth drew downward a little ? " to turn a dishonest penny . Only it 's dollars he 's interested in . Millions  --  money like Fen 's . I do n't think really that there 's anything Sloane would mind doing . Anything he would n't stoop to . Anything ... " " How can you love him , Sylvia ? " " Oh , he does n't love me , Maggy . He could n't love anybody , really . But he  --  yes , I suppose I love him . If there 's anything I can do to stop it I wish you 'd tell me . He  --  we 'll be all right . I 'm exactly the " ? again her mouth twisted downward a little ? " I 'm the front woman he wants . I 've got looks . I 've got friends , rich friends , well-placed friends . I can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite a team , " Sylvia said and laughed shortly . It was again like seeing somebody walk resolutely off a cliff to self-destruction , like seeing a swimmer in ominous , rolling waves refuse to turn back to land . Maggy went to her as she had done to Fen . " There 's no need for this . You 're so lovely , Sylvia , so . . . " Sylvia would n't look at her , and Maggy , looking down past Sylvia 's bent , shining black head , saw her cigarette in the ash tray . It looked rather odd ; there was some small thing wrong with it . She looked and said : " That 's funny . "  | Sylvia lifted her head with a jerk . Maggy said : " There 's no lipstick , yet . . . " Sylvia said earnestly , as if it mattered : " Oh , I never use lipstick . I use mercurochrome . The color is just right for me . " Again revelation had the effect of a physical shock ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said : " You were here that afternoon . You talked to Bell in London . You knew Charles Brooke was dying . And you told Sloane ... " " Of course , " Sylvia said . " Why did you come ? What . . . ? " " I knew you were coming back that afternoon . I wanted to talk to you  --  I ? believe me , Maggy , I wanted to find out how you felt about Fen . If you still loved him , if you 'd make trouble about a divorce  --  oh , I wanted to get things clear in my mind . Fen said you would n't mind but I could n't be sure . I 'm efficient , you know . I had to get a course of action planned and so much depended on the way you felt about everything . Fen loaned me his key ; we used to meet here occasionally . . . . " " Fen had a key ? " But of course he 'd had a key , the key that Sloane must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken Sylvia , seeing how useful she would be . ( " You want to take that , too , " Fen had said . ) Sylvia said , lightly : " Fen had one of Laura 's keys . She 's so careless , you know . But I 've had a perfectly ridiculous time trying not to let the girl on duty in the afternoons see me . That big hat . . . " She made a derisive , graceful gesture toward the hall . " I 've huddled myself up in it like an old witch every time I 've gone past the desk . But anyway  --  yes , I talked to Bell . So I saw then that the whole idea might be changed . I thought I 'd better tell Fen . And tell Sloane , " Sylvia said coolly . " You were sitting there , smoking , when ... " " I had barely hung up when you came in with Bill . I decided that it was not the time , then , to talk to you . In view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Bell calling when I answered , " Sylvia added with an astounding effect of candor , " I thought , of course , that it was Fen . "  | Suddenly Maggy knew that there was no question about the woman in black ; " Sylvia , who was that woman ? The woman who was murdered . . . " Sloane had been frightened when she accused him of murder . Sylvia 's face changed , her whole manner changed . She glanced swiftly at the clock , jumped to her feet and caught Maggy 's wrist . " You 've got to come with me . Hurry , Maggy . " " No .. " Maggy , you 've got to believe me . In the taxi that day , you said I looked ill and  --  do you know why ? It was because I thought it was you who had been killed . I came back here and saw a crowd and the ambulance , and they said a woman . . . I thought that dead woman was you . I was on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't consent to  --  I thought you 'd been killed . . . . " She drew herself up and cried : " Now will you come with me ? " " And that night , the first night I was here , Sylvia , you had scrawled on that memorandum pad . You ... " " Oh , Maggy , that does n't matter ! I  --  all right , I did . It was the only thing that showed that I had been here . That and a cigarette that I forgot . It seemed better to take the memo sheet away . " " Who took it ? Sloane ... ? " For the first time perhaps in all her life , Sylvia 's beauty vanished . She looked white and ugly ; she said : " Do you think , if I knew , I 'd dare to tell you ! " The clock ticked and ticked ; time went on and yet stood still . Sylvia said all at once : " I do n't know who the woman was . Sloane ? nobody would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't find it . I did find a  --  a hat . It did n't look like one of Laura 's . It was in the closet . . .. " She glanced at the foyer  --  the closet , of course ! A broken piece of privet had testified its presence ! " Where is her handbag ? " " I do n't know , I tell you . There 's an incinerator out in the service corridor . It seemed best to make it look as if a burglar had been here . " Her clear eyes went again to the clock . " You 've got to come , Maggy . I am your friend . Believe me. 1 ' 11 go along with many things that  --  but not with murder . "  | Sylvia , the decoy ; Sylvia , the bait . " Sloane sent you . " " Sloane . . . " Sylvia 's eyes flickered . She caught her breath and went into the foyer ; she started to pick up her hat and then , with a short laugh that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gave up . " All right , if you 're afraid to come with me  --  go alone . But get away from here . Hurry  --  hurry , Maggy , " she said and opened the door rather softly and gently and , without looking back , went out into the hall . The door closed behind her . Sylvia , the decoy . But Sloane still had Fen 's key . She double locked the door . But that would n't stop anybody who had the key . She turned back toward the living room . As she entered it the white silk scarf slid from her pocket to the floor there in the doorway , around her feet . What was there to do ? But there were any number of things to dol She was in New York ; there were people ; there was the telephone . Bill  --  but Bill was in Philadelphia . Well , then Russell Warner . Hurry . She pushed the scarf away , leaving it , a bright white patch on the floor . She looked up Russell Warner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , too many Warners . At last she found it and dialed quickly , blurring the motion so she had to dial over again and then wait . And waiting , watch the doorway to the foyer . It seemed very important to watch the doorway . The distant bell whirred and whirred in her ears for what seemed a long time before she saw that the white , strong silk scarf was gone .  | THERE WAS no motion anywhere ; there was not a sound anywhere in the world except the whir of the bell in her ear . But the scarf was gone ; quietly , while she looked for Russell 's number . So therefore  --  therefore  --  where was he hiding ? She put down the telephone . But that was wrong ; she must telephone down to the desk . What was the number ? The great , thick gray telephone book was on the table and she did n't dare take her eyes from the doorway ; she did n't dare look down ; she did n't dare leaf through that book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there led to a service corridor and escape ! " He 'd do anything , " Sylvia had said . And , " I thought that dead woman was you . " Maggy had threatened Sloane ; she had said that he had murdered the woman in black and that she was going , with the police , to identify her . It was n't the money this time , it was fear ! Where was he hiding ? She let her eyes leave the doorway . She looked carefully , as if each chair , each table , had to be identified , all around the room . The door to the terrace was behind her and it was bolted ; she 'd made sure of that . The doors into the dining room stood open . The dining room was dark except for the light falling through the doorway . The open doorway was like an invitation ; it was a straight pathway to the kitchen . She went like a slim black shadow herself , across the path of light into deeper shadow . Ilcr skirt rustled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own heart .
