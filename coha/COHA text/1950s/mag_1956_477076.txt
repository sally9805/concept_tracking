An intimate report on the most ruthless ? and vainest ? of the Latin American dictators , by a once-close associate who is now a fugitive from El Benefactor 's wrath . AS A journalist in the Dominican Republic I witnessed some of the lavish celebrations designed to pay homage to Generalissimo Doctor Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina , Benefactor of the Fatherland , on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his seizure of power . I found it impossible , however , to see the whole elaborate show . On October 28 , 1955 , my wife and I left all we possessed ? a successful newspaper property , a beautiful home , a highly profitable law practice ( among my clients were two big American corporations ) , a high government office , and a yearly income figured , after tax deductions , between $60,000 and $65,000 ? and got out of the country in a hurry . But even if I had stayed , I would not have enjoyed the feast , since I had , inadvertently , incurred the real displeasure of the Benefactor , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribe , the newspaper of which I was owner and editor , had showed a crowd of school children placing flowers at the base of one of the 1,800 busts of Trujillo that clot the country . Beneath was a caption informing my readers that the little ones were putting their blossoms on the Benefactor 's " tomb . " The error , an obvious minor newsroom mix-up , became serious only because of the Benefactor 's power andidiosyncrasies . To put Trujillo 's immortality in doubt is the worst conceivable offense to his ego , and offenses do not go unpunished in Trujilloland . Fortunately , before the misprint appeared my wife and I had arranged a trip to the United States to attend a meeting of the Inter American Press Association in New Orleans . And although the big guns of the National Palace 's propaganda office had already started firing insults against me , we left the Dominican Republic as scheduled . Apparently , in the confusion of the moment , no one had issued instructions to detain me , a rather difficult decision in any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind without fear of the consequences , was not around . Three or four days before , he had gone to Kansas City to work out a series of $200,000 cattle and horse deals . During the days following our arrival in the United States I had an opportunity to read the Dominican press , and what I saw there about myself did not look reassuring . A campaign of personal vilification against me had started in one of my paper 's competitors , La Nacion . My wife and I had always been disturbed by the role I had to play as one of Trujillo 's editors . Now our sense of disgust increased , and after deep inner conflicts and mutual consultation we decided we would not return . We have not regretted that decision . Before the final breach , however , I made a short trip to Kansas City and personally informed the Generalissimo that I was not going back . I offered him , as a peace gesture , my newspaper for sale , and he politely asked me to write him a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since been passed around as proof of my treason . Upon his orders , decrees were issued stripping me of every post and medal I ever had . Professional , political , and private organizations declared me persona non grata . My own newspaper under its Trujillo-appointed management joined the pack and printed the most disgraceful stories and cartoons . I was even asked to return the keys of Ciudad Trujillo , which had been granted to me in an apparently thoughtless moment . This I could not do since the keys had been removed , together with many other little mementos , by the police during their search and subsequent occupation of our home . As " enemies of the people , " " Communists , " and " traitors " we have been greatly harassed in our exile , and ? until the dawn of liberty in Santo Domingo ? we have lost , through phony law suits , alleged back-tax claims , and premature mortgage foreclosures , all that we left behind . One of my American clients called me in New York to tell me he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . It was a futile gesture : I had already been disbarred on Trujillo 's orders . Propaganda leaflets ? paid for by the Dominican taxpayers ? have been distributed in great quantity in this country to influence the American public against me . My father , a respected lawyer , former judge , teacher , and senator , has been thrown into a Dominican jail and accused , of all things , of drug addiction . The federal authorities of the United States have been bombarded with all manner of accusations against me . Fortunately , this country is not the Dominican Republic . No action has been taken . ABSOLUTE BENEFACTOR T HAT a man should go through all this because of a peccadillo such as mine might seem outlandish to anyone ignorant of the Benefactor 's enormous sensitivity to the slightest suggestion that he is not immortal . At a well preserved sixty-five , he needs constant assurance that life for him is just beginning . His paid eulogists and the big advertising posters hanging over Times Square constantly remind you that Trujillo 's " Caribbean Paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up by Haiti . This represents an area about as big as New Hampshire and Vermont combined , with roughly 2,400,000 inhabitants , most of whom are engaged in raising the sugar , coffee , and cocoa on which the country 's economy depends . A formidable number of the non-agrarian 20 per cent of the population is occupied in seeing to it that the whims of the Benefactor can be speedily translated into the law of the land . Trujillo 's vanity is staggering . Wherever you go in the Dominican Republic his image is before you in the form of statues , murals , medallions , pictures , and the like . Beside the door of practically every house and but is a plaque proclaiming that the residents are under the comforting protection of El . Jefe . The plaques sell for $30 and bring in a nice bit of revenue to Trujillo 's hardware concern , which issues them on an or-else basis . El lefe 's self-adulation hit a high point year at the - International Fair of Peace inform mankind of his anniversary . He spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tract on the outskirts of Ciudad Trujillo , the capital city , formerly known , in pre-Benefactor days , as Santo Domingo . The Fair consisted of seventy-nine imposing buildings , including a Temple of Peace ; a vast Coney Island imported from the United States ; a $1,000,000 Fountain of Music and Light ; and enough effigies of the Benefactor to fill a museum the size of the Metropolitan . Trujillo 's eighteen-year-old daughter , a handsome brunette named Angelita and the young apple of the old man 's eye , was carefully groomed for her role as Queen of the Fair ; since the day of her proclamation she has been addressed only as Her Majesty . The chances are that she will continue under this title indefinitely . Although the Fair is over , she is still the Queen with a diamond-studded gold crown , an 880,000 Italian gown , and a heavily bejeweled scepter . This outfit is stunning in more ways than one : in a country whose per capita national income is 5226 , its cost represents the annual income of approximately 800 people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fair did not add up to much in the way of increased tourist trade . In its first seven months of operation it attracted only 24,000 tourists , though 500,000 were expected . However there is another , more sinister , side to this Caribbean opera bouffe which came blindingly to light when Dr. Jesus de Galindez , a Basque scholar and journalist , disappeared from his apartment in New York City on March 12 , 1956 . Dr. Galindez , an instructor at Columbia University at the time of his disappearance , had lived in Santo Domingo for many years as a refugee from Franco 's Spain . Before he vanished he had completed a critical study of the Era of Trujillo ? as El fete allows his period in power to be called ? which has recently been published in Latin America with great success . When it was suggested that the Benefactor might have had something to do with Dr. Galindez ' disappearance , he promptly denied it . Simultaneously a pamphlet appeared in the Dominican Republic stating that Dr. Galindez was a " Communist " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both steps are the usual procedure after the disappearance or sudden death of a Trujillo foe in foreign lands . In spite of the Benefactor 's firm assurances that he has no truck with that type of political warfare , the fact remains that a large number of the enemies of his regime have had the bad hick to meet a violent end while in exile . Writers Sergio Bencosme and Andres Requena were shot to death in New York City . Pipi Hernandez , a labor leader , was stabbed to death by paid hoodlums in Havana . Mauricio Baez , another labor leader , left his home in Havana one day and , like Galindez , has not been heard of since . Clemente Savifion , a farmer , disappeared in Haiti . Also in Haiti , Luis Arias , a journalist , was murdered by unknown thugs . My own acquaintanceship with Trujillo began after I went to jail for political reasons in 1946 . I had been active in an underground organization of young professionals and university students who were interested in bringing true democracy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the University of Santo Domingo 's law school , I was managing editor of the daily La Opinion . When I returned to my job upon my release I found that the paper was soon to be bought by Trujillo . The new publisher , one of Trujillo 's biographers , fired me when I refused to put my by-line to an article praising the Benefactor . On that day I became a marked man . Trujillo forgives once ? or at least appears to ? but this was my second offense . I tried to lead a quiet life and keep out of political trouble , but marked men are borne down upon by all kinds of pressures . There comes the moment when , if you insist upon resisting , there is only one alternative ? to vanish . By the time I reached this point I had a family to support , and I decided to play ball , as the majority of Dominicans have been forced to do . When Anselmo Paulino , Secretary of the Inrerior and at that time Trujillo 's most trusted aide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to take the editorship of El Caribe , I tried to avoid the issue , claiming that my journalistic days were over and I was now a lawyer . Trujillo sent me word that it was a matter of taking the job or losing my law practice . I went to work for rujillo . Until the floral trouble I got along well enough . In my frequent interviews with Trujillo. he never used a biting word , although sometimes when I was waiting in the anteroom of his office I would hear him dressing down one of his subordinates : " Imbeciles , imbeciles , " he would shout , the majority of the time rightly , " I 'm surrounded by inib ? ciles . Why must I be compelled to do everything ? " In public El fefe 's voice is shrill , and his pronunciation uncertain , particularly when his ghost-writers insert high-sounding words into his orations . Still he is a more fetching leaderthan his big brothers in other monolithic lands . He is agile and exceptionally healthy , standing five feet nine inches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boots and shoes with their built-in elevator heels . In full regalia , as generalissimo of an army of 14,000 ( which would ordinarily be in charge of a two-star general ) , he looks like a Balkan hussar . ADMIRAL AND FAMILY MAN T II E unity of the military services about which the United States worries so much has been completely accomplished in the Dominican Republic . El . Jefe is the nonpareil in all divisions of the military establishment and , as admiral of the fleet , frequently takes a thoughtful stroll on the bridge deck of the Angelita , once famous in American society columns as Mrs. Joseph Davies ' Sea Cloud . Few American millionaires could maintain a ship like this one , but Dominican taxpayers have made it possible for her to appear as an " auxiliary ship " of Trujillo 's navy . Trujillo is frugal in his habits . He does n't smoke or play cards , and is a moderate drinker except at the now-infrequent parties in his country home . As a rule he is an early riser , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning to be asked by the Benefactor about matters large and small concerning their departments . On one occasion a Secretary of Agriculture was called from his bed to find out the whereabouts of a mule . The Benefactor dearly loves to be presented as a family man , and he is free with honors for his immediate relatives . His son , Rafael , Jr. , who was a colonel at the age of five and a general at nine , is today at twenty-seven a lieutenant general and chief of staff of an air force whose planes he is not permitted to pilot . Junior 's younger brother , Rhadanies , the Benefactor 's other legitimate son , is a major at thirteen . But , as always , there is one problem child in the family : daughter Flor de Oro , who has been in and out of the Benefactor 's good graces . Flor , the image of her sire , has run the matrimonial scale as if it were a velocity exercise . She has been married seven times , and among her ringed conquests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his longtime collaborators once remarked to me , " is like the weather ; everybody talks about him , but nobody can do anything about him . " He is as unpredictable as the weather too . Even his origins are obscure . His official biograppers skip over the clays of his nonage with a few brief words to the effect that he was born in San Cristobal , taught to read and write by his grandmother , suffered diphtheria , and attended grammar schools . " Both his environment and the times curtailed his early formal education , " says one . A secon , writes that the necessity to make a living led him early " into other avenues . " According to Albert C. Hicks , an American newspaperman who wrote a book about Trujillo called Blood in the Streets , these other avenues included forging , cattle rustling , informing , and pimping . But all such charges are impossible to document . Trujillo has had twenty-six years to clothe his origins in mystery , and as custodian of all the records in the Dominican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life pretty much as he pleases . The obfuscation of his career is almost absolute until we come to the solid fact that at twenty-eight he enlisted in the army . After a brief period in the training center of Haina , he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and presently , in the service of the United States Marines , fought against the bands of Dominican rebels who were opposed to foreign intervention . In 1921 he participated in an engagement against the " bandits " in La Noria , and was cited in a Marine communiqu ? . His progress in the army was extraordinary . In two years ( 1923-25 ) , he jumped from second lieutenant to lieutenant colonel . Two years later he was a brigadier general , chief of the army , and a trusted aide of aging President Horacio Vasquez . However , he was accepted by neither the old politicians nor Dominican society , a fact he resented keenly . When a revolution to overthrow Vasquez started in Santiago in 1930 , Trujillo , while publicly swearing loyalty to the president , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off handsomely ; a short time afterward lie took over the presidency . One of his first acts as chief executive was to force his way into the old and aristocratic Union Club , which had rejected his application a couple of years before , and to get himself elected president . Immediately afterwards he decreed that the club he discontinued , a vengeful slap at the proud traditions of Dominican society . He took care of the politicians who had ignored him in like manner : he ordered all parties to disband and formed his own Partido Dominican ? . After crippling the old Dominican upper class , he announced that his blood was prouder than any of theirs ? pure Castillian on the paternal side , while his mother was a direct descendant ofa Napoleonic courtier named Joseph Chevalier , Marquis of Philborou . THE PRECIOUS CEDULA E VER since he succeeded in grabbing power , Trujillo has been apprehensive that somewhere in his political woodpile there is a Iatter-dav Rafael ready to do to him what he did to Vasquez . For this reason he is continually pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had old days , he used to employ a gang of storm troopers known as La 42 to eliminate anyone he considered a threat to his dictatorship . Recently , he has become more sophisticated . his victims are now stowed away in prison after due process of law in which they are accused of rape , drug addiction , tax evasion , embezzlement , and the like . It is his proud boast that there are no political prisoners in Dominican jails . To control the members of his official family , he has the ' Toro Publico " ? the letters-to-theeditor section of El Caribe . Every morning , with fear in their hearts , Dominican officials read this section before anything else , for the appearance of anyone 's name there is a sure sign of imminent trouble . The letters printed are of the most damning variety , and are written in the National Palace . Since I was editor of the newspaper for many years and its owner since 1954 , I know Trujillo himself dictates the majority ; the rest are written by his most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented a series of regulations that they must abide by from the cradle to the grave . In order to go to school , to work , to practice a profession , to get married , to open a shop , or to travel , one needs innumerable licenses , authorizations , and other documents from the government . Every resident of the country must carry at all times a card called Udula Personal de Identidad , which includes a serial number and the name , age , civil status , occupation , race , address , fingerprints , picture , and other information about its possessor . On election day the citizens take their C ? dulas to the voting booth , where they are stamped Votado . As Herbert Matthews of the New York Times once observed , failure to vote is " tantamount to flaunting opposition to the Generalissimo , " and Trujillo always gets a tremendous si for his ticket . To make sure that the objects of his benefactions wo n't stray from the path he has ordained , Trujillo has set up army check points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance that somebody might try to drive through them , huge bumps have been placed in the road before each . The C ? dula must be displayed at every check point , and it must bear a stamp indicating that its holder has paid his per capita tax . Penalties for being remiss about taxes range from heavy fines to jail sentences up to five years . The largest single item in the Trujillo budget has been , from the beginning , for the armed forces . In the 1956 budget of about $122,000,000 something like $28,000,000 is set apart for military purposes . The military enjoy all kinds of special benefits and are paid relatively well , but every now and then , for fear his bully boys . may try to become too big for their breeches , Trujillo shakes up the structure of command . After one of these house cleanings it is not at all unusual to see the former head of the navy serving as chief of police , or a former lieutenant general functioning as a colonel . About 50 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefe either by blood or marriage , but , kin or no kin , Trujillo does n't trust them very far . ALL THIS AND MONEY TOO y E T while he uses a big stick with his army , he walks softly in his role as civilian head of the Partido Dominicano . Every Dominican over eighteen years of age belongs to the party , since those who do not carry its registration card can not get a job . Ten per cent of the pay of government employees is deducted for party funds , but , unlike its counterparts in Communist countries , the Partido Dominicano does not function as a branch of the government , even though its nominal head sits in on cabinet meetings and other official functions . It is rather a clearing house for a great many of Trujillo 's personal , business , and political activities . It has charge of the internal propaganda to promote Trujillo as a benevolent rather , and in the chief 's name it performs several charities and looks after a welfare program mainly concerned with giving away free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds for this program to the party , which thereupon buys its milk from Trujillo 's dairy monopoly and shoes from his factories . More or less in passing , the party also provides the candidates the dictator wants to run at election time . In addition , it is , perhaps , the only profit-making political organization in the world . But even so it is not the main source of ' fruj il lo ' s income . Although privately owned monopolies are specifically forbidden by the Dominican constitution , Trujillo owns ? either in his own name or in the name of selected cronies or members of his family ? six of the fifteen Dominican sugar mills ; the only milk pasteurizing and distributing organization in Ciudad Trujillo ; a lumber cutting and drying trust ; the only edible-oil factory ; the biggest shoe factory ; and the only cement and cigarette factories . He operates the only modern slaughterhouse ; owns the only glass factory , the only paint factory , a hat manufacturing concern , a large liquor plant , the only battery works , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television stations , a chemical manufacturing concern , a shipping company , an insurance company , the Dominican Republic 's one airline , a textile mill , a plant for processing tropical fruits , the only shipyard , the most , expensive night club in Ciudad Trujillo , and three or four construction companies . He holds a 20 per cent interest in the one Dominican Republic brewery , a large interest in a dress-making establishment , and a sizable interest in Felix Benitez Rexach , contractors for harbors who built the ports of Ciudad Trujillo , Rio Haina , San Pedro de Macoris , Andres , Barahona , and Puerto Plata . El Jefe likewise controls the distribution of rice and sugar for the domestic market and handles the sale of all imported cigarettes . His brother-in-law is the Dominican representative of two of the most important U.S. automobile manufacturers .. Trujillo , along with his immediate family , is also the biggest real-estate owner in the country . It is impossible to find out exactly how much land he and his relatives own , but his Hacienda FundaciOn extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dominican Republic that when Trujillo was rounding up his gigantic acreage , the land he could not buy from the legitimate owners he acquired later from their widows . To keep the wolf even further from his door , Trujillo gets a take-off of 10 per cent on every public-works contract awarded by the government , and , as an " honorary member " of the exporter 's cartels , takes a commission on every pound of coffee and cocoa sold . He controls all the iron ore , gold , and copper deposits in the Dominican Republic , and is currently exploring , with the help of the American financier William Pawley , for other minerals , including oil . These are merely a rough estimate of Trujillo 's holdings . No one can say accurately where his private properly begins and public domain ends . One formula advanced sotto yore by Dominicans to explain the difference is : " If it loses money , it is government-owned ; if it makes money , its El lefe 's . " Trujillo 's defenders contend that in the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of his enterprise , imagination , and resourcefulness , the country as a whole has gained a full measure of prosperity . It is true that the Dominican Republic is fairly prosperous , but its good times are due to the solid price of coffee , sugar , and cocoa in foreign markets . The apologists also make much of the physical changes the Benefactor has effected in the country , and certainly no other place in the Antilles is quite as spotless as his capital city . His country allegedly has no foreign public debt ; its budget is balanced : it pats no controls over foreign exchange ; its peso is on par with the American dollar ; it is stable internally ; it does not discriminate in tax matters between nationals and foreigners ; it is always busy with public works . But you have only to walk through the streets of Ciudad Trujillo to realize that tinder Trujillo there is no joy , little laughter , and much fear . HATS AND HURRICANES W H E N Trujillo puts on dress uniform , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encrusted with gold braid , a gold brocaded coat with enormous epaulets , a tri-colored sash , and white-striped blue trousers . The plumed hat is the supreme symbol of his exalted rank , and he is the only person in the country permitted to sport such headgear . When Anselmo Paulino , his favorite for seven years , fell into disgrace , one of the chief charges against him , as printed in El Caribe , was that he had been photographed in the privacy of his bedroom wearing a plumed hat . For days , the entire machinery of government was busy investigating the whereabouts of Selior Partlino 's hat and the photo of it . The hat fetish is only one of Trujillo 's peculiar characteristics . He is highly superstitious . It is said that his well-known fear of hurricanes conies from the prophecy of a witch who told him that , as he came into power with a hurricane ( the one that struck the capital city seventeen days after his first inauguration ) , he would go out with another one . The strange thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at the slightest warning of a big blow I used to be deluged by frantic phone calls from the Palace . Ostensibly Trujillo is now a Catholic . In 1954 he traveled to Rome to sign a Concordat with the Pope , and Catholicism is the official religion of the Dominican Republic . Presumably , Trujillo joined the church because his wife , whom he had wed in a civil ceremony , wanted to sanctify their union . Having been twice divorced , Trujillo was not a likely candidate for a Catholic wedding but he somehow won the necessary indulgences and the rites were performed on August 9 , 1955 . To create a good name for himself and his country , Trujillo spares no expense . He has spent ' millions , mainly in the United States ; and the pages of the Attorney General 's report dedicated to the people who are or have been in the past his registered agents for the Dominican Republic in Washington read like a section of Who 's Who in America . These pages are studded with names such as Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Max O'Reil Truitt , son-in-law of the late Vice President Alben Barkley ; former Senator Millard E. Tydings ; and Franklin D. Roosevelt , Jr . The Benefactor is also generous with visiting journalists and gives a plush welcome to any junketing American Congressmen who happen along . Some of them agree - with Trujillo 's views about anyone who opposes his dictatorship . Olin Johnston of South Carolina , for instance , after a brief trip to Trujilloland last July , told his fellow Senators that it was a very had thing indeed " for the United States to tolerate the working of sinister forces in our own country , Corn 111 11 nistically inspired , whose known purpose is to injure the Dominican Republic and its people and eventually subject that nation to control by a Communist government . " He added that he himself intended to devote his energies " to informing the American people of the true situation with respect to the Dominican Republic precisely as it exists , " and concluded : " It is my further intention to conduct such investigations as may be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An investigation would be welCome . Trujillo goes to all of this trouble to perpetuate his name and see to it that the Trujillo. line of succession continues . Only a short time ago he made his brother , Hector , president of the Dominican Republic ; more recently he amended the constitution to make it possible for a person twenty-five years old to become chief of state ? opening the way fur his son , Rafael , Jr . It is doubtful , however , that either Hector or Rafael , Jr . will ever be the man El Jefe is.
