txt The Italian Communist party professed today its determination to seek a democratic Italian way toward socialism . ' It pledged that it would not copy methods adopted by the Communists behind the Iron Curtain and emphatically denied it was expecting communism to be brought to Italy on the bayonets of the Soviet Army . The strongest Communist party in the West made these comparatively sedate statements in an official platform draft for its impending congress . Great importance is attached to this congress , scheduled for December , because Palmiro Togliatti , party leader , has promised that it would thoroughly discuss the downgrading of Stalin . The promise was made after the disclosure of the secret speech by Nikita S. Khrushchev , Soviet Communist chief , to the Twentieth Soviet party congress early this year . The speech caused unrest in the party 's rank and file here . Showed Taoist Leaning In his first public comment on Mr. Khrushchev 's speech , Signor Togliatti referred to the " degeneration " of Soviet society under Stalin and advocated " polycentrism " for the world Communist movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Titoism . No such strong language as Signor Togliatti had been using for a short period last spring was to be found M today 's document . However , efforts to rally a bewildered and unruly rank and file around a homegrown brand of communism were still plainly visible , analysts said . These observers believed the new Communist platform was being framed with a view to propitiating UV . Socialists . The debunking of the Stalin myth is viewed here as the primary cause of Pietro Nenni 's left-wing Socialists loosening , if not actually breaking , their alliance with the Communists . It prompted them also to seek rapprochement with the antiCommunist right-wing Socialists . Declaration Unsigned The platform draft appeared under the title " Elements for a Programmatic Declaration of the Italian Communist Party " as a special 9,000-word supplement to today 's L'Unita , official Communist organ . The declaration was unsigned , but it is understood to be the work of a group headed by Signor Togliatti . A rather verbose introduction giving the early history of communism was noteworthy only because it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and II the declaration remarked that " the errors * * * committed do not offset the enormous actives. balance " of Soviet , achievements . The declaration acknowledged that more " errors " occurred in the Soviet Union and " popular democracies " behind the Iron Curtain after World War II . Again without mentioning Stalin or any of the Soviet leaders who survived him the declaration said these errors " led to unjustified restrictions of democracy and grave violations of legality . " The document hastened to add that the errors had been " denounced and . corrected . " The fight for " socialism " ? Communist parlance , for communism  --  has now entered a new stage , the declaration went on . Now " new forms of attaining socialism , new ways of recognizing the dictatorship of the proletariat and of wielding power for building a socialist society " have become possible , the Communist document stated . " The ways that are open and that must be followed in the various countries do not coincide , " the declaration continued . It explained that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be used in regions of " highly developed capitalism and greatly varied political structures . " To make ' Italy completely " Socialist , " power must be seized by " the working class and its allies , " the declaration said . But it would be wrong , it added , to postpone till then the solution of urgent social and economic problems . Such reforms must and can be enacted now , and this is the direction that " the Italian way toward ' socialism " must take , the declaration said . The ' declaration said communism never favored " violence for the sake of violence . " It branded as " absurd and ridiculous " the notion of a Communist " revolution imposed by foreign armies . " This was considered a disavowal of the diehard Stalinists who advocate an Armed insurrection in the hope it would touch off a war in which the Soviet army would invade Italy . , ? Italy has the historic task , the ' Communist dpcimient said , of reaching " socialism on a new 1 road , different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been achieved in other countries . "
