During his eleven years in the prize ring , Virgil ( " Honeybear " ) Akins , 30 , never earned much more than a reputation as a listless , slow-starting pug . Last week the St. Louis Honeybear suddenly turned into a tiger . To the delight of a home-town audience , he took just 20 seconds of the first round to put New Jersey 's Vince Martinez on the deck in their fight for the welterweight championship of the world .
