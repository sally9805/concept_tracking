All through World War II , submariners complained about the torpedoes issued to them . The men of the Silent Service hung up their impressive record with erratic " fish " that were seldom as good as those used by the enemy . Unpredictable U.S. torpedoes sometimes went off prematurely or never exploded at all . They were known to porpoise or to dive under targets , and at least two circled about with diabolical accuracy to sink the subs that had launched them . Last week the Navy 's Bureau of Ordnance announced that , as part of a $500 million research and development program , it had developed a new homing torpedo that was the answer to submariners ' dreams . <P> The new torpedo is said to be almost twice as fast as earlier models , and able to travel accurately to the operating depth of any known submarine . Small and maneuverable , it has its own Sonar for seeking out enemy craft that have killed their engines to ride out an attack in silence . No telltale wake of bubbles comes up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be launched not only by submarines , but also by surface ships and airplanes . The Navy now expects to reinstall torpedo tubes on all warships smaller than heavy cruisers .
