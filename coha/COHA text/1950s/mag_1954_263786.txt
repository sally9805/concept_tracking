A British royal commission investigating the struggle between Arab and Israeli 17 years ago arrived at a tragic conclusion . " Fundamentally , " said the Peel Report of 1937 , " it is a conflict of right with right . " Last week-one world war and one local war later-the judgment was still valid . The Jews were right , because 4,000 years ago the narrow strip of Palestine , where 1,670,000 today carve out their earthly Zion , became the cradle of their culture and religion . The Arabs were right , because for more than 1,000 years the land had been theirs . <P> The Arab-Israeli war , which the Arabs lost but the Jews did not win , ended only on paper . In five years of truce , some 500 Israelis and an uncounted number of Arabs have been killed or wounded in fierce border clashes which the U.N . and its armistice teams are powerless to prevent . Some in recent months have assumed the gory proportion of massacres-Kibya last October , when Jews killed 53 helpless Arabs , Scorpion Pass last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those are only larger , remembered episodes in a situation that is worsening rapidly . Last week TIME correspondents concluded tours on opposite sides of the border between Israel and Jordan . <P> From the Israeli side , Contributing Editor Sam Halper cabled : <P> As night fell on Mishmar Ayalon , a frontier settlement which stretches to the Jordan wire , 20 miles northwest of Jerusalem , a tired , unshaven man , coated with the dirt of the field , picked up his Sten gun and climbed to the roof of his house . The village generator , silent all day to save fuel , started to put-put , and 73 floodlights splashed light across the rocky fields . So began another night in the siege without respite that has been going on for five years . <P> The man on the roof peered towards the rude enclosure where the village 's sheep were penned . He was the shepherd of Mishmar Ayalon , and the Sten gun his crook . Since 1951 , six of Mishmar Ayalon 's men had been killed by bullets out of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain Shmuel Schiff , a wiry youth with a hussar mustache . <P> One night I joined Shmuel Schiff as he made his watchman 's rounds . We stumbled through the dark across whirls of rusty barbed wire , past shoebox houses pock-marked with bullet holes . He poked his pistol at the heavy-meshed windows , to make sure that they were strong enough to keep out hand grenades . A rifle barked in the distance . We turned about at the end of the village near an abandoned house . A widow had lived there until one morning last June , when three men poked dynamite underneath the floor and blew her to pieces . U.N . officers tracked the killers to the Jordan border . <P> We moved on to Schiff 's house , where he told me his story : <P> " My father and brother died in Auschwitz . My mother and I survived in Budapest because we forged identity cards that made us into Christians . My wife comes from Rumania . Her six brothers and sisters were also killed . We passed through many hardships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a kerosene stove and seven acres , and two children . We have found our place . . . Nothing can move us from here . "
