( See Cover ) <P> The time passed swiftly as the two old friends and classmates sat in a Concord , N.H. hotel , swapping reminiscences about the old days at Dartmouth . In the three years since their graduation , class of ' 20 , Richard Pearson had worked as a textbook salesman , saw ahead of him a promising career in book publishing . Slim young Sherman Adams was already a successful lumberman . Preparing at last to leave , Salesman Pearson grinned and said he guessed they must have talked about nearly everything . Adams agreed . Then he added matter-of-factly : " I got married today . " The startled Pearson spun about . " Where 's the bride ? " he cried . Replied <P> Adams : " Out front in the car . " Pearson , only half-believing , insisted that he be shown . " Sure enough , " recalls Pearson , now with Macmillan Co. , " there I saw the littlest thing curled up on the front seat , fast asleep . That was Rachel . She was 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams did not end on that first day , or even the next . It has continued for 32 years and , although marked by a curious and continuing sort of one-upmanship ( in which Rachel Adams is more than capable of holding her own ) , is one of unusual devotion . This is the flinty touchstone to Sherman Adams : often inconsiderate , always demanding , possessed of the disposition of a grizzly with a barked shin , Adams has in him rare strengths of loyalty , integrity and selflessness that inspire the respect and confidence-and sometimes even the fierce affection-of those closest to him .

" <P> Harry Truman was the first U.S. President to make a real start toward establishing an adequate White House staff system . Truman , who greatly improved the administration of the presidency , deemed his staff of such importance that he conducted many meetings himself-and that was probably a mistake . On paper , the White House organization under Truman appeared much the same as that under Eisenhower . But by working so directly with his staff members , Truman encouraged each to come straight to him with his problems . Thus Assistant to the President John Steelman was bypassed , decisions were made without his knowledge . Truman was constantly bothered , and the whole staff concept was often defeated .
