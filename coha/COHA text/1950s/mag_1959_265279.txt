As the broad-beamed U.S. Navy missile-test ship Norton Sound pulled away from her dock at Port Hueneme , Calif , shortly after dusk one day last August , a dockhand bellowed to Captain Arthur Gralla , the skipper : " What time tomorrow ya coming back , captain ? " Yelled Gralla in reply : " I 'll let you know . " To all appearances , Norton Sound was off on another of her one-day , routine , rocket-testing trips to the Navy 's offshore test range . But Gralla knew , even before opening the sealed orders in his cabin , that Norton Sound would not be docking at Port Hueneme ( pronounced Wye-nee-mee ) the next day , or for weeks afterwards . Her destination : a secret rendezvous with a special Navy task force off the Falkland Islands , some 10,000 miles around the Horn and off in the South Atlantic . <P> Last week , nearly eight months after Norton Sound ( a 15,000-ton converted seaplane tender ) steamed out of Port Hueneme , the world finally learned where she went and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times 's story ( see PRESS ) that the missile ship had fired three nuclear-armed rockets 300 miles into space in what one enthusiast called " the greatest scientific experiment ever conducted . " If it was not quite that , it was certainly one of history 's most spectacular scientific experiments . Its name : Project Argus . The glowing accounts of the scientific results ( see SCIENCE ) missed the point that Project Argus was also the most spectacular **25;11531;TOOLONG project in the history of a U.S. Navy that anchors its future in mobile , missile-launching sea power . <P> Urgent Questions . Before he sailed , Captain Gralla was called to Washington for high-level briefings on his part in the project . President Eisenhower was planning to announce in late August the U.S. 's willingness to suspend nuclear tests for one year and try to work out a test-detection agreement with the Soviet Union . Before entering into test-ban negotiations , the U.S. needed to try for answers to some vital questions : What would happen when a nuclear explosion took place in a near-vacuum 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects of coping with oncoming enemy ballistic missiles by exploding nuclear warheads high above the earth ? Could the Soviet Union use high-up explosions to cheat on a test-ban agreement ? How much would high-up nuclear explosions disturb radio communications and the radar detection that is indispensable to U.S. defenses against bomber or missile attack ? <P> The questions were even more urgent than Captain Gralla knew when Norton Sound set off on Project Argus : two 100-mile-high atomic explosions carried out by the U.S. in August at Johnston Island in the mid-Pacific caused heavy interference with radio and radar over a distance of 700 miles . <P> Secrecy was absolutely essential . The U.S. did not want the Soviet Union to find out about Project Argus and monitor it . And President Eisenhower did not want the world to know , when he announced the one-year test suspension ( beginning Oct. 31 ) , that the U.S. was about to carry out secret nuclear tests in the South Atlantic .
