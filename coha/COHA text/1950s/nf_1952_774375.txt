txt  | MOST of us remember our childhood with wonder and pleasure , even when that childhood was unpleasant by our grown-up standards . We were concerned simply with being alive , then , with the look and feel and smell and taste and size and shape of things . It was a time when the world seemed full of magic , and every day was full of new wonders and old delights : perching on a swaying branch in the climbing tree , hidden by the greenery and watching the people far down below ; squatting by a full spring brook rushing down its rocky watercourse , seeing a crayfish dart backward behind a stone ; lying on a hilltop staring into the deep-blue sky , then rolling over to watch an ant climbing up a blade in the jungle of grass ; watching a gull rocking on an offshore breeze . These magic moments were wonderful because we became a part of the rustling tree and of the gurgling brook , of the deep sky and the grassy hilltop . For breathless instants we were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We became so much a part of these things that our memories can still excite us with the places that we found : the green hole under the willow bushes , the cave in the woods , the old quarry , the  | swimming hole , the snowbanks piled up by the plows . These places became so much a part of us that we made places where we could be part of things still more . The forts and igloos we built in snowbanks , the moats and castles in the piled-up sand , the tree platforms , the tunnels leading to the clubhouse , the hut in the woods , the scratchy nest in the haymow , the constructions of boxes and cartons in the back yard ? all satisfied our need for building , our need for making places . Unhampered by idea or prejudice , our senses responded to such places ; and while we forget many of their details , we remember the feelings those places gave us , their essences . We know what it was like under a card table , behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the stairs , in a tool shed . There was a rapt wonder about the low , slanting planes of the attic roof , the hiding place behind a trunk , a deep dormer big enough to crouch in , a window seat , the glider on the vine-shrouded porch or the cobwebby , earth-damp place beneath its flooring . And one of the greatest wonders of all was a roof pitching low enough so that it could be climbed on . As grownups , we now and then come into places which stir  | us deeply because they recall those early states . We are again aware of where we are , of what surrounds us , and we are conscious of a deep satisfaction which is somehow outside of memory or emotion and is warm , homely , natural and comforting . This physical kind of memory , this recognition of past states , this reknowing of what we were and still are , constantly and inextricably gets involved with the places where we live . Our twenty-odd senses report on what goes on inside us , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with our feelings and instincts , help us to identify our hungers and our needs . Most commonly , several of our senses work together to create an impression , and these awarnesses we are apt to call senses also , for want of a better word . We have a sense of shelter , which seems to be a desire to be protected , to be covered , to be enclosed . It is a feeling for the cave , for a roof over our heads ; a liking for the nook , the ell , the cubbyhole . Opposed to this is the sense of space ? a need for the open , the vast , the airy ; that feeling of pleasure we have on a mountaintop , in an open car , on a ship deck . Both of these awarenesses are related to empathy ? that sense which makes us a part of things around us , that makes us one with the horse we ride , the hovering hawk , the wide stillness of a lake at nightfall , the straining pole vaulter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with swift or sudden movements and with tensing of muscles , as well as with stationary manifestations of strength and vastness . Empathy starts in us those feelings which recognize when the spindly piano legs are too fragile for the heavy sound box , when columns are too bulky or when roof supports are so thin that there 's always the feeling the roof is about to come crashing down . There is related to this a physical sympathy , which helps us identify ourselves with our surroundings when we do not actually seem to make ourselves a part of them . Its most obvious manifestation is a satisfaction with our surroundings that makes us say , " This is our sort of place , this is the spot for me . " Our muscle senses get involved with the places where we live ;  | the sense of hefting , for instance , makes things seem large and heavy or light and fragile , as if you could pick up that chair with one finger whereas it would take a derrick to lift this table . As well , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling of relaxation or slackness . A writhing candlestick or tortured table leg can seem not only ludicrous but even annoying . Our tactile senses , which tell us whether things are smooth or rough , hot or cold , dry or slippery , also become involved . Many plastics are unpleasant for this reason , their surfaces looking , as well as feeling , greasy or too hard or too brittle ? a reaction one rarely has to such natural materials as wood or stone or metals . These tactile and muscle senses evoke what is called a haptic response in us ? a kind of vital and energetic sense of feel , the kind of energy we recognize in the strongly marked forms of Van Gogh 's paintings . Also constantly involved are our measuring senses , some of which may be a combination of eye and muscle reactions . The sense of completeness is one manifestation , a certain lack of satisfaction being felt when a line stops suddenly , or when a room has only three walls , or when a wall goes only part way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are looking are not in balance . This is a feeling of loss , as when one of a pair of candlesticks is missing , or when a familiar and expected object is incomplete ? a signpost without a sign , a bed without its covers , a house without a roof . Measuring senses give us a feeling for length and breadth and mass , so that we know at once when a room is too long or too narrow or too high , when a highboy is too large for its space , when pictures are too close together on a wall , when a chair is too small for its occupant . And this is related to that sense of order which is disturbed when a picture is crooked on a wall , or clothes are strewn around a room , or when there is a saucepan on the piano . Many of us carry this sense of order to extremes , arranging books in descending order as to height , and other such finical and unnecessary actions which show uneasiness or in- security , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for putting things away . It is interesting to notice how such simple and natural responses are exaggerated by people whose emotions are in a turmoil , or whose basic needs are not satisfied by the places in which they live , or by their living . One of the most important senses concerned with the making of places is the sense of privacy ? that sense of being alone , of being secluded , of being completely free of others , responsible only to one 's self . As children , we made places far away from things , hidden and secret , and this was not merely from a wish to escape or to get away from it all . We seem to be more aware of the absence of privacy than of its presence , as when we suddenly become conscious that we are not alone or are being watched . Few things are more unsettling , especially when we are in the midst of private actions . When we have no sense of privacy nearly all our actions are inhibited , even such simple ones as taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . There are rooms where a loosened necktie seems wrong , even though we are alone there and do not expect interruptions . Our more easily recognized senses strongly influence our reactions to places where we live . We voice these directly when reactions are negative , as when a room is too dark or too bright , too cold or too damp . We can tell when colors are too strong or when they are the wrong hue ; we are quick to notice unpleasant smells , or when a seat is too hard . And as our states of well-being vary , or as we are different from the norm , so do our reactions to places vary . Some of us dislike bright rooms because our eyes are extremely sensitive to light ; others dislike windows set high in a wall , for top light is irritating to their eyes . Some people are sensitive to noises , becoming quite irritable at the creaking of a cricket or the dripping of a faucet , while others are n't bothered by such things at all . Thin people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of heat . We should be able to control  | such things , to vary places according to our states of being . Noise is a special nuisance in our crowded cities . Particularly in modern apartments where rigid construction and smooth , hard surfaces bounce sounds around , the resulting boom of noise becomes quite annoying to most of us . Noise and sounds , as well as all those things our other senses register , affect our emotions and states of being enormously . A hostess who wants to perk up a party , for instance , can turn up the lights and open the curtains so sounds can bounce off the panes , while another who wants to calm down her guests will turn down the lights and turn off the thumping phonograph . A room is pleasant or unpleasant , invigorating or relaxing , depending on our sensory reactions to it . As children , we made places for no great purpose , merely building because we wanted to . We often lost interest in them even before they were finished . And yet we remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied our senses . Our animal natures responded to them . No less should be expected of the places where we live as adults . And they should also suit our actions . We have all known rooms that were oppressive , ones which we leave with a gasp of relief and a flinging of the arms . Some rooms seem to weigh us down , driving us into the corners . All of us have sat in chairs that make us feel ridiculous , or pompous , or insignificant . And we are not considering here the reactions of neurotics or limp-wristed aesthetes but of quite normal human beings . Grand Canyon or Grand Central makes any of us feel small , because they are not formed on our scale . Any of us feel cramped in a phone booth , or today 's bathrooms , or a Pullman kitchen . Such constructions are inhuman . They do not satisfy our animal natures . They inhibit our actions ; they do not pleasantly serve our needs . Now this is all well and good . Admittedly our houses have scant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little else can be expected of a collection of boxes , one cubicle reserved  | for this use , another reserved for that , the largest set vaguely aside for living , the smallest for storing . Making places that fit our needs can not be done by making boxes . These depend on focusing attention on the spaces enclosed . And many of these places must serve a variety of functions . It is quite difficult to think of an ideal space before we see it , for we are apt to think in terms that are negative , in terms of quantity . For reading , we need no glare and lots of light , and so on . But such requirements are not the answer . If we eliminate the box and focus attention on space , we are off in the right direction . We can then figure out what to do with the space once we 've got it and to think of how we would like it to be in terms of needs , in terms of comfort .  | MAKING places for easy living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinch in the average room ? that oblong of air bounded by flat planes , cluttered with all sorts of objects , including people , cut up by a number of openings of varying size and shape . This sorry box is poorly ventilated , badly lighted and noisy , among other things , demanding daily hours of work to keep it clean and neat . For generations this shape was the easiest to build , and attention came to be focused on making a setting for our actions , a background for them or a frame . The past couple of dozen centuries of decorating and furnishing them has done little to eliminate that boxiness which is their chief characteristic . Most of us hate boxes for living in , whether we think of rooms in such terms or not , and it is only in the past two generations that we have learned enough to use the new materials that make the box unnecessary . The leader of the de-boxers was Frank Lloyd Wright , and what he and his followers did about houses will give an idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about because he also hated corners , those eight places in a room where the three planes of walls and floor or ceiling come together to shut in space . A room was  | a box with four sides , and boxiness could be destroyed by eliminating the walls . But walls helped support the roof . Wright loaded the roof on piers , a return to that simplest and most ancient kind of structure called post and beam , and proceeded to do away with one wall . This elimination helped focus attention on the enclosed spaces and not the confining planes . The house could open up to the world of which it was a part , the enclosed space extending to the open spaces beyond by the use of glass . The room was no longer a box ; but now it looked incomplete , like a stage set with one wall missing . So Wright broke up the large glass area with wooden frames and did away with another wall . The room ceased to look so artificial but still looked too open . He replaced parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The remaining walls took on a protective quality , having the feeling of arms . The part walls , too , added to this feeling , and suddenly the space seemed wrapped around one . The glassed areas going around a corner eliminated not only the boxiness but the corner itself . To focus still more attention on the space , a second oblong was added to the first . A room became L-shaped . This was actually adding corners to a room ,  | making twelve in all , but four of them were usually out of sight , around the outside corner . The spaces were not ended but continued on , for parts of the enclosing planes were out of sight . And the spaces seemed to merge . There was endless variety to this arrangement , a focus on space , as can be noted by cutting out two rectangles of paper and overlapping a corner of each in various ways . Attention is focused on the area , not the outline . An outside corner seemed to expand room spaces , and so it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside ones as well . This was done by making a corner look as if the corner of a second room were extending into the room you were in , and also as if your room were expanding beyond its limits ? an interpenetration of planes which was somehow relieving because you became aware that there were other rooms into which you could go . The plane of a remaining wall could thus be broken up , and while this was expensive when the wall had to bear a load , it was not costly if it became a screen supporting only itself . Such walls could be set at angles easily , as well ; so a wall could be pushed in or shoved out where the spaces enclosed required , thus adding a tremendous flexibility to those spaces . And they could be curved . There were only two flat planes remaining ; the floor and the ceiling . Floors that jogged up and down were a nuisance . A room needed a tranquil , solid base on which to rest , and no pur- pose was accomplished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done , but it was easier to change ceiling levels . If a roof was pitched , it was easy to take advantage of the attractiveness of these slanting planes , particularly when modern insulation did away with the need for so much dead air space . Then too , the large glass areas needed protection from the glaring sun , so the roof was extended far out over what was left of the walls , becoming protective eaves . Overhead spaces in a room were pleasant ; they got rid of still more boxiness . And these were made to seem still more vast and airy by bringing the eaves down to the tops of the glass areas and having them turn back on themselves , coming back into the room as overhead ledges . This joined the inside with the outside still more . The L-shape and the clawlike projections had worked well on a horizontal plane and would work equally well on a vertical plane . The floors could extend beyond the walls and glass , to be turned up into railings and parapets just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been noticed that when glass was used in a corner of the room the openness gave the appearance of an ell because the ' eye was not stopped . The same was true if an entrance was placed in the corner of one wall and the room was extended into the hall . A passage in the center of the wall tended to divide a room into two sections , and also it seemed to destroy the sense of shelter and privacy of a room . With the entrance in a corner , the hall seemed to merge with , and add to , the spaces of the room without destroying its unity . This could be done by extending one of the walls into the hall , or the glass area , or a bookcase , or a ledge . Even a rug extending into the hall ? or a wall color or hanging , or a row of pictures ? would cause the spaces to merge into one another , yet still retain their own unity , still give you a feeling of being in a place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this gradual change is particularly wonderful where spaces are small and apt to be confining . The secret is to preserve the sense of the room while extending the  | space beyond the bounding planes , at the same time eliminating corners . With entrances grouped in a corner , a room has a feeling of being a place , not just a passage or a dead end , and the room itself is less disturbed by people passing to and fro . Even so , there is a feeling of incompleteness , a lack of privacy , if you walk directly into one room from another or from the outside . A hall makes a transition from one space to another , marking a change of place . Entering , and being inside after having entered , is even more pleasant when a bookcase or a turn in the wall or some sort of screen separates a room from the hall . A hall also helps fix attention on room spaces . The narrowness of a hall makes a room seem wider , its verticality accenting the expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage ceilings are just overhead , only three or four inches more than six feet . Walking through them , aware of the moving surface above , one has a sudden memory of snow sliding under sled runners , or a dirt road moving under the floor of a wagon . We have a sharp sense of movement when passing through halls , because the ceilings are so close , just as we are more conscious of  | speed in a jeep than in a high-flying transport . And when you enter a room from these passages , space seems to explode . There is a sense of spacious rest when you get into the room , and the contrast makes the large and tranquil spaces much more satisfying . If the axis of the hall is at right angles to that of the room , the satisfactory feeling of change of place is still further enhanced . When a room is just a larger extension of a hall , one has a feeling of being propelled into the room ? and of wanting to go right on through without stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying the axes within the room itself . If a hall filters us into a room , there is no reason why the space in one part of a room should not filter into another . A simple rectangle could have but one axis , but an L-shaped room could have two . If room spaces were only partially separated from one another , each space could have a different axis . A room could thus have a main axis and several minor ones . Space could begin to come alive . Decks and terraces could have axes different from the enclosed spaces they adjoined . And because these open areas were not roofed , they could be angled most freely ? still another way to vary space . Consequently , space could be separated and joined at the same time , making for openness and seclusion at once . Most of the house spaces could be joined into one , with parts that were separated when we wished to be alone . The house itself could be quite small , but expanded vastly in warm weather to the decks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be closed away from bad weather without giving any feeling of being cooped up . The materials that made these spaces ? glass and sheet materials and masonry ? were the finish of the house , the house itself being its own decoration . It could be as efficient as an apartment , without a cliff dwelling 's drawbacks , and it worked as well in suburb as in country . All these changes focus attention on the space , not its boundaries , and begin to put it to work . The houses spread out along  | the ground , the glass areas arranged in banks which extend the interior spaces still more . Many of Wright 's early houses seemed to be all roof , covering the enclosed spaces . Many of his later ones seemed to be all floor , partly covered , the floors extending on out to decks and terraces . Because of this , many of Wright 's houses give a feeling of being on shipboard , and people speak of his houses floating in the trees , soaring above the ground or along it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole countryside seems to become a part of the house . And when this extension of roof and floor works together , the enclosed spaces are a revelation of both sense of space and sense of shelter . They have been called exciting , but perhaps it would be better to call them gratifying , for they satisfy basic hungers . This new emphasis on space can now be used for making places . Here is the purpose behind the change . But what kind of places can be made ? That depends entirely on the uses to which the place is put , what we want to do there . And the use dictates the way the space should go , its form following its function . It seems useful to try to consider space as a thing in itself . If we no longer need think of a room as a box to be decorated , we can more easily think of one as space to be made into places suiting our needs and actions . With the roof loaded on piers , the walls becoming self-supporting screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical and economical . Construction is greatly simplified , and much of it can be done by the home carpenter . Being able to think of space as a thing in itself , we are unhampered in the making of places , freer now to consider them in terms of our needs and actions , to consider them in terms of this matter of comfort .  | JUST as space is a key consideration in the places that we make , so is sitting . Sitting is such a common action , part of almost everything we do , that it may prove useful to think of it as a thing in itself . Just because it is so common , sitting is frequently subordinated to other functions that get involved in the making of places . Couches , chairs and other seats are often works of art and craftsmanship , and their interest because of design , or color , or other decorative values may interfere with consideration of that more basic concern as to whether they are comfortable to sit on . In small spaces we might consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch is too short to stretch out on ? a prime reason for most couches in the first place . It can be argued that life consists of moving from one seat to another ? a gloomy reduction that would be more tolerable if most seats were comfortable and if those simple designs that are satisfying were not invariably relegated to the kitchen , the bedroom or the porch . We like to sit in different ways at different times , so we need different kinds of seats in a room . We like to tip back in chairs and shove them around , so some of them should be light as well as sturdy . We change positions every few minutes when sitting , so that chairs designed to fit the form too closely are often uncomfortable after a time . Chairs that are too bouncy give us a feeling of insecurity ; those that are too soft seem to follow us around with every move . We have noted that chairs can cause  | us to strike attitudes and can make us feel pompous , insignificant or ridiculous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match the position ? like that of a girl on a chaise lounge pretending she 's Cleopatra . Watching her , any males around might get to thinking they are Caesars . We like to get our feet up when we sit down . We like to be able to lie down whenever possible . The couch best adapted for various kinds of lolling is probably a box mattress fitted out with some bolsters and pillows , and next best may be those with seats and backs of removable cushions . Frames for both sorts can be simply , handsomely and sturdily made , while the mattresses or cushions can be fitted easily with different slip covers . Someday , perhaps , an enterprising manufacturer will offer a line of upholstered furniture covered in heavy muslin , either offering an additional line of tailored slip covers from which to choose , or supplying a set of simple patterns so that women can make their own suits for the furniture . When it comes to arranging furniture or changing the fabrics to suit whim or season , upholstered pieces with removable cushions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divans , davenports , sofas and chesterfields . More than one person in a household likes to stretch out , so it stands to reason that most rooms should have at least one couch and maybe two . A pair of couches comes in handy at parties , when extra seats are needed , and for overnight guests . There is an argument against having these together in a corner or flanking a fireplace , for we have a tendency to congregate around such arrangements in a single large huddle . If one of the couches is in a secluded spot , it is pleasanter for a quiet nap , or reading , or for a serious talk at a frivolous gathering . This is especially important if there are children present . Even so , a couch is usually the largest piece of furniture in a room , and the key to comfortable furniture arrangement is its placement . Once that is decided on , everything else seems to have a logical place in which to be .  | The seat of a couch is comfortable for most when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on . This means taking the sag of the cushions into account . A height of seventeen inches can be comfortable when the seat is not too deep ( that would be about twenty inches ) , or when it is deep enough so that one can lie back and pull the feet up . The perfect height is one that is slightly less than the distance from the floor to the back of the knee when bent , which would be about seventeen inches ? a distance which does n't vary much between people . Women compensate for their shortness by perching or by wearing high heels . This height holds true for chairs , where it is particularly desirable that the seat slant down toward the back from two to four inches , depending on the height . The higher the seat , the less slope . Unlike couches , most chairs are uncomfortable when they are too deep from front to back . A good chair should give support in at least three places : the small of the back , from rump to shoulder blade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to support the thigh muscle itself and the tendons at the back of the knee . Sometimes this works fine , but more often our legs go to sleep . There 's not much to do about this except stamp the foot . A cushion in a too-deep chair will help support the small of the back . In lieu of a cushion , most of us slouch down to take the strain off those muscles which hold us upright , as well as to feel the satisfying support on that curve in the body where the rump leaves off and the thigh begins . This last is perhaps why so many people like to lean against a cabinet or table leg , why we like to throw a leg over the edge of a table or squat on a stool . We sit so much that these muscles need stretching now and then ? another reason why there should he different kinds of seats for different states . Most of us also like to feel support just under the shoulder blades , and this will sometimes compensate for lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is pleasant to be supported across the shoulders and on the nape of the neck . For  | comfort , the back of a chair feels best when it slopes about four inches from seat to shoulder blades . If the back is high , the slope should be enough so that the chin is not pushed down on the chest . If the back slopes properly , a seat cushion only sixteen inches deep is about right . But if a chair is fairly low or the back is almost straight and well upholstered , a seat eighteen or twenty inches is more comfortable . The greater depth is best when the back cushion is loose and can be pulled forward to suit . Back cushions are most comfortable when their edges rest on the seat cushions , rather than being tucked down behind the seat . While most chairs are too deep , still more are too narrow . A chair should be wide enough so that you can pull your leg up easily , so that you can keep your arm at your side when you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that you can hold a small child or pretty girl in your lap without being smothered , cramped or crushed . A chair seems to be comfortable when it is at least twenty inches across between the arms ; two feet is still better , giving you a sense of spacious luxury . It may be a personal prejudice , but most chair arms feel too high , eight inches seeming to be the greatest height needed when you wish to rest an elbow on the arm and support your chin with your hand . If a chair sags much when you sit in it , an arm six or seven inches seems preferable . Arms only four inches above the seat feel comfortable to many of us . Chair arms should be almost flat on top , wide enough not only for an elbow but for a drink as well . The latter are always falling off chair arms , but that fact does n't keep us from using arms as ledges . Even when an arm is carefully rounded so that things ca n't be set on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms should be padded or formed , especially if one is bony . A fourinch width is desirable , and a six-inch width is still better . The arm should be wide enough to hold a friendly bottom on occasion or a sleepy child . Good upholstered chairs are hard to find , and their proportions depend on relations of part to part and not necessarily on  | arbitrary dimensions . Even so , no one chair is apt to suit every mood or every person , although it may be impossible to find two different ones , both comfortable . It may be worth remembering that thin people have a tendency to slouch forward , so that lower , deeper extremes suit them best . Old people with a dread of falling and fat people who have a tendency to lean over backward prefer higher , straighter chairs . Also , women and children dislike sitting in chairs where their feet dangle . The answer seems to be a chair fitted with loose cushions , seat and back , which can be plumped or squashed to suit the sitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisal , and without inner springs . Springs and webbing should be built into the frame , not the cushions . Sometimes very light springs or foam rubber work well in loose cushions to make a happy medium , but this depends on the construction . Fabric also is important , for a stiff fabric will make a cushion seem firmer . In this respect it is important to avoid fabrics that are too nubbly and clinging , or too smooth and slippery , or ones that wrinkle or soil too easily . Softness and upholstery are not all the answer to sitting comfort . Windsor chairs and wooden stools are often more comfortable than many upholstered pieces , if well made and well proportioned . The main thing for comfort is flexibility , it being necessary that the chair give with your movements . Cane or rush seats , or those made with leather or canvas webbing or cord , are often comfortable because they give a little . Wicker seats , which used to be relegated to the porch , are wonderful to  | sit on because they change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their squeaking is reduced . Many of the sling chairs made with leather , webbing or canvas are comfortable because of their flexibility . One of the best of these is the modern version of what is called the African safari chair , a sling fitted on a bent metal frame . The various stools and lounges made along the same lines and sometimes fitted with cushions are usually comfortable . And all of these have the advantage of light weight so that they can be shoved around easily , many of them so light that they can be picked up without effort . It is an advantage when as many chairs as possible can be moved to suit varying needs . Perhaps the most comfortable chair ever devised is the yacht chair , that delight of the Hollywood director , made of stretched canvas on a folding wooden frame . It is comfortable to sit in for a long time because the canvas and frame give when you do , always amenable to any position you choose . Light and sturdy , they can be washed and refinished easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a desk , if these last are built low enough . Tables should be adjusted to chair heights , not the other way around . You can sit comfortably all day in a deck chair fitted with a seat cushion . Metal versions of these are poor supporters , the metal cold to the touch indoors , sizzling in the sun . The cane and rush equivalent of these , which do not fold , are almost equally comfortable , and some people prefer their less nonchalant appearance .  | Actually , all plans for sitting should start from the floor up , for we squat , kneel , crouch , sprawl and lie down in those places where we feel at home . Floor sitting is too pleasant to be reserved for children , dogs and sleepy drunks . There are never enough chairs for everybody at a party , but there 's always space on the floor ? one of the few places in today 's houses where there is likely to be enough room to stretch out . Warm floors and soft rugs help make floor sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy because it is so difficult to take up or two or three rugs that can be removed for cleaning with ease , a second layer of scatter rugs or lap robes or furs here and there helps add to sitting comfort . These extra fabrics give not only a feeling of luxury but can be draped over the furniture to add to its softness and are warming when the room is chilly . Probably the most flexible seating device ever designed is the oversized hassock , one that is two or three feet across and eight to twelve inches high . It can be leaned against , sat on , used as a table and moved around easily where needed . A hassock has one drawback : It can be stumbled over . Footstools , which are called " dammits " by decorators , are usually worse because they are smaller and are more likely to be tripped over . There should be a permanent place for a hassock , or a stool , to which it is always returned for the night . Benches are comfortable seating auxiliaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fire , a bench six or eight inches high and three or four feet long comes in handy for both  | flame watching and apple roasting . Larger benches , sixteen to twenty inches high , fifteen or eighteen inches wide and four or five feet long , make good tables in front of a couch . Extra cushions in a room can double the seating space , and some people sew three together to make a pad ? two of them on the floor for a seat , the third tilted up against the wall for a back rest . Foam rubber makes excellent cushions because it keeps its shape and can be smoothly fitted with fabrics , but this material is still expensive . It is the best material , however , for cushioning hard , flat surfaces such as window ledges and low cabinets . Some people like the idea of buying twenty or thirty such cushions and having chair and couch frames made to fit them , using the extras wherever they come in handy . As useful as cushions are pillows of different sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floors or anywhere else they are needed . Pillows can make almost any furniture comfortable , and when covered in bright colors they add to the cheerfulness of the room , making sensible the use of more subdued and restful fabrics for the larger pieces . Color seems to be most pleasing when used as an accent , and when the brightest are used on pillows the colors can be varied endlessly , helping to make color a satisfying emphasis rather than an added irritation . Comfort depends on sitting , and by making seats so that they satisfy varying needs , we have a basis for making places that are wonderful to be in . Any room that contains a couch or two , three or four chairs , a hassock or two , three or four stools and benches and a supply of cushions and pillows is almost sure to be tolerably comfortable . Our job , now , is to see how we can make it more than that .  | WHERE we put couches or chairs has much to do with how comfortable they are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much light ? or not enough ? if there 's a draft , if there 's nothing to look at but a blank wall . The surroundings can have a tremendous effect on enjoyment . A key part of satisfaction is what we look at , and this is so even if we do n't look at it . Because what we see and feel is so important , sitting gets involved with the spaces surrounding . Nobody likes to sit near the kitchen door in a restaurant , or near the serving table . When one of my college roommates went on dates he always saw to it that the girl faced into the corner , away from the rest of the room . He was all she had to look at , and because she could n't watch other activity , she had a feeling of privacy and intimacy that was uninhibiting . My roommate appreciated a basic architectural fact ? that the feeling a place gives us is more important than the place itself . Nobody is apt to place chairs where they look on the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed by any to-and-fro . But many rooms have furniture arranged for looks and not for comfort . Making places pleasant is more than a matter of good taste in furniture arrangement and decoration , for when we sit down , although our bodies have come to rest for a time , our senses keep right on going . There are two kinds of views in any room : what we see inside the room and what we see outside the enclosed spaces . After dark , only the inside view is to be seen , even though we may be aware of the night outside and the spaces beyond . The inside views are particularly important when making a place for a couch and the other large and rarely moved pieces of furniture . Where the couch goes may depend on the location of the fireplace . Placing the couch immediately gets involved with architecture . A couch before a fire is supposed to be romantic . Usually it 's too hot if the fire is blazing brightly , too cool when the fire dies . A couch should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing it , unless the family enjoys sweltering . And such a distance destroys that highly desired privacy and intimacy . It 's also hard to watch the flames , particularly for the nearsighted . Easy chairs are good flanks for a fireplace , for they can be moved more easily . However , a couch at right angles to the hearth puts everyone properly close to the fire , yet still out of the direct line of reflected heat , and keeps the space in front of the fireplace clear . When there is no fire , the couch at right angles can still be a pleasant place to be , for there is another direction , other than toward the empty hearth , in which to look . One of the most satisfactory places ever devised is the inglenook . The feeling of that cozy retreat within a room is easily retained by backing a couch with a tall cabinet or bookcase . The solid mass behind gives a sense of shelter , the fire a sense of warmth . How we like to sit before a fire will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for this is the most important of interior  | views . The kind of fireplace will dictate whether it will be used once a month or three times a week . And its use will decide how important a part it should play in a room . For many of us it is good to remember that a fireplace does n't have to have a fire in it to be a wonderful thing . Many of us enjoy the sight of the logs ready for lighting . The brass or iron fire tools , the brick or stone , the hoard of ashes from past fires , the fire screen ? all give a room a homely , comforting look . A fireplace should be so built that both large and small fires look well in it . The opening need not be large , and it is possible to warm a room , even cook on the hearth , if the firebox is only two feet square . Most of us like big fireplaces , large enough to use three-foot logs as forelogs and backlogs , although the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large enough for only a few coals or branches , are often most pleasant for small rooms , where a large fire would be too warm and burn too long . L-shaped fireboxes , and raised hearths for easy tending , can add to the cheery delight of many a fireplace .  | Many people are afraid of fireplaces , feeling that they ca n't trust themselves to see that a screen is placed before the blaze each time they leave the room . To simplify this a flexible mesh screen , built into the frame on a track so that it can be pulled across the opening like a curtain , is often enough reassurance . Forgetful people properly avoid raised hearths , the extra few inches of height adding to the trajectory , and danger , of flying sparks . But no matter what kind of fireplaces work in best , they should be planned with the near-by seating in mind . A fireplace is most satisfying when well inside a room , away from open outer walls . Its imparted feeling of solidity and permanence is minimized if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While flues can be part of masonry walls , the stone surfaces giving weight and handsome rough looks to a wall , simpler flues of insulated sheet-metal pipe are often enough cheaper to be desirable . Buried in the walls or behind paneling , or even exposed , they eliminate the need for expensive masonry work . The best such flues are made of two pipes , one inside another , with a dead-air space in between . A couch by a fire gets involved with architecture because a hearth is usually the focal point of a room . The desire for an enclosed feeling , an intimacy and warmth , is often best satisfied when the couch is actually built in and backed by relatively high shelves or cabinets . This immediately separates the space from the rest of the room . Most of us like this feeling of separation and enclosure , but if the room is already small , such an arrangement immediately makes the room feel cramped . The alternative is to put the fireplace and a couch in a corner or ell , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially surrounded on three sides , the feeling of intimacy is not lost , especially when the couch faces not only the fireplace but into the room as well . It is interesting to note here that most people seem to prefer having the couch to the left of the fireplace , with the room expanding out to the right . Most people also seem to prefer rooms which open to the right , with the entrance wall to the left . This  | preference may be due to the fact that most of us are right-handed , and our natural way of turning makes places adapted to it seem more familiar . If you enter a room and pass along a wall to your right , the room seems more pleasant if there is an ell space at its end , and not a corner . Yet , we have no objection to rooms that open to the left if we can enter them by turning right in the hall . And we seem to prefer houses that vary the ways that rooms open up to us , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than going straight into it . Once , perhaps , we used to circle like a dog before settling down . Certainly if the main flow of a room is clockwise , its monotony is relieved if minor spaces flow counterclockwise . A room and its spaces are more congenial when its direction and flow varies within itself and in relation to other parts of the house . This emphasis on the way a room opens , and its direction , seems confusing and picayune , and takes some puzzling over before becoming clear . But the puzzling is worth the effort , for our way of moving about a room has a lot to do with whether or not we like to be in it . With a fireplace in an ell , we can more easily vary arrangements to suit our way of moving . But if we ignore this whole business , we are apt to feel uneasy in a house whose rooms do not go the way we want them to . Very often we will dislike a room seemingly for no reason at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of such a room we may feel differently about the room if we hold the illustration up to a mirror . The strange and antipathetic may suddenly become familiar and pleasing . Some architects show clients two plans , one a mirror image of the other , to see which they prefer , and builders of developments sometimes use a reverse of their basic plan for half their houses in order to satisfy this odd quirk . Often it is not possible or desirable to build in a couch next to the fireplace . It is pleasant to have a fireplace coming out into the room , particularly if the room is small , the projection breaking the room 's rectangularity . Such a fire may be best  | viewed from clear across the room , and the ell put to use for a place to read or write . The fireplace thus becomes subordinated to the room itself . The fire may be in a distant corner , away from the place where we choose to sit and read , or from the desk where we may want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the space , warming the whole room with its light and shadow . In such a case , seeing the fire is more important than being near it , and as both are pleasant , different fireplaces about the house can satisfy one or the other of these feelings , or both . In a bedroom or workroom , for instance , the more distant fire seems more satisfying . Whether a fireplace makes a place with its accompanying couch and chairs , or whether it is something across a room primarily built for looking at , the fireplace itself can vary endlessly to suit precisely our needs and the shape of the room . The standard U-shape is only one of many . One leg of the U can be shortened to increase visibility , or the opening can be L-shaped . The opening can be only two feet high , or six ; it can be two feet wide , or six . There can be a mantle , or the fireplace can be simply a hole in the wall of stone or brick . The opening may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room , or it may be a foot or so up in the wall , with a stone shelf underneath it , or it may be half a dozen inches or so below the level of the floor . We have noted how a hearth may be raised to make a seat , and a bench or club fender may be set before it so that you can get close to the blaze . The fireplace should suit its use and the space it occupies in the room . The fireplace is not the only center of attention in the room , even when it does not form an ell . Other main features become important spaces to look at or to be in . We seem to like the sense of a sheltering wall and the seclusion it gives , even when we are reading , or working at a desk , or playing or listening to music . Such activities require a certain amount of privacy for one or two people , and the paraphernalia for them fits very well into an  | alcove . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room ? at the furniture or a picture or hanging on the wall , at the play of light and shadows on the floor and walls and ceiling . We rarely like looking at a blank wall a few feet away . And we like also to glance out of the windows occasionally . Windows traditionally serve three functions : to let in air and light , and to look through . While most windows in a house can serve all these uses well , it is often more pleasant to design some which are only to let in air or light . These can often go high in walls or ceilings , like the clerestory and skylight , while louvers under the panes can serve to let in air . Such strong overhead daylight in an ell of a room or in small places like halls or bathrooms makes seeing easier , and often makes it possible to look out and up into the sky at clouds or stars . Because the light is so strong , the direct glare from such windows can be cast on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall it becomes a constantly changing mural made of light . Such light glares too strongly when the windows face south , unless the beams cast come into the house in such a way that nobody ever h : s to look directly at them . Perhaps the most satisfactory all-purpose window is the outswinging casement , whose panes act as vanes to scoop in or repel the breeze , and which when open seems to extend the interior spaces outside . Glass doors are even more pleasant , for they can be walked through , linking the inside to terrace , deck or grounds . Manufactured examples of such doors and windows , with opening and locking mechanisms , are usually too elaborate and complex . It is certainly simpler and not much more expensive to have simple frames made to set in between the studding . If a window is used only for looking out of , a fixed sash is often the most practical , even though most of us prefer to open any glassed spaces , if only from the habit of being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can be made absolutely weatherproof . And it can be slanted in or out . A window that  | slants out from the top seems to add the dimension of height to a view , while its outer surface sheds dust and rain more easily . The height of the window sill depends entirely on the spaces inside and outside the room . If the sill is low , the room usually takes on a feeling of spaciousness . In many rooms , windows that reach to the floor or to the level of a low seat are most pleasant , whereas those in hallways and bedrooms might be built over cabinets to make for privacy . If plate glass is used for a fixed sash , quite large areas of glass are still strong enough to be leaned against , and look quite wonderful with a couple of bright pillows tossed against the pane . Too large areas , however , often look as if part of the house had been removed , giving much the feeling of a stage set . It is often pleasant to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen through a window may be the important thing about it . Placement can be planned in relation both to the inner spaces and the view . If there 's a window at our elbows , or just across the tabletop , the things outside close to the pane ? a bush , or a stretch of grass , or some flowers , or a small tree ? can become the center of attention , and these can be so placed that they will attract the eye or simply direct the line of vision to a larger view . The scale of such outside things is paramount , for if the scale is large , more distant things will be dwarfed . When the scale is small the rest of the view will seem larger , and closer . Windows should be placed so as to frame the view , some windows looking out on things close by , some on things in the middle distance , some on things far off . And different windows can be set so that one can look at the views from different angles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a room need to be larger than windows looked through close up . And it 's usually more pleasant to look through a window from a slight angle to it , for this gives dimension to the view . Placing a couch underneath a window usually means that anyone sitting on it has to turn around to look out , while people facing the  | couch must look over the heads of those seated there , the light from behind casting their faces into deep shadow . Couches and chairs are most satisfying when at an angle to the window . But it may be desirable , still , to build in a window seat for those who like to get away from the crowd and commune with things outside . To add the dimension of depth to a window , it is usually best to angle the window itself to the view . Few painters ever paint landscapes directly head on , yet most houses are set square to what 's outside , which flattens whatever we happen to be looking at . Beach houses , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore and waves and horizon have no depth at all . Equally , it 's not unusual to try to get the whole view in every window , which makes for monotony . Various parts of the view should be seen from different windows in different rooms so that the glimpses through them are always varied , changing as the light and seasons move across the land . It is perhaps for this reason , among many others , that so many windows are made of small panes . Some architects have taken up the Oriental practice of making various odd-shaped pieces of lattice and grill- work to set over the glass so that light coming through the pattern is as interesting to look at as the view beyond . For the same reason , windows are sometimes made in unusual shapes-. diamonds , lozenges , round or oval ? to add variety to the light coming in and to the view beyond . When it comes to making places , not only is the arrangement of groups of furniture important . Also involved is the interior view , or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , or what we see through windows and doors . All these become involved simultaneously , and the planning of one will involve the planning of the other two . The result is a wonderful place in which to be , but a lot of attention is needed to make it  | UP TO NOW , most of what has been said seems to apply only to those people who plan to build from scratch . Most of us would agree that emphasis should be on the spaces enclosed , the places where we do our living . And these certainly should be adapted to our needs . When designing such places it is logical that emphasis should be on the way we are going to feel there . They can be enjoyable if we provide for a variety of comfortable places to sit , if there is a feeling of snugness and openness at the same time , and if the windows and doors opening to the outside are placed so that they make the inside alive with light and shadow , at the same time allowing glimpses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less tenuous and intangible . There 's nothing to get your teeth into , little to put on a plan . And it might seem difficult to apply all this to a house that was n't built with all these things in mind . Even if we have been forced to buy the shoe box 's some builder has thrown up in a development , or one of the cramped coops that were built so widely in every suburb in the Twenties , any good sense we possess can make pleasing most of the places in which we live . In the development houses of the Forties and Fifties , most of which have fair-sized living rooms , and in  | the houses built in the Thirties , out of which partitions can be ripped , there is still room for the application of architectural good sense . There is no real substitute for space ? for sheer size ? in a house . But what we realize about our living , once we think about it for a moment , can add comfort and pleasure to almost any interior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tremendous amount of concern can do amazing things to a space six feet square . If there 's room to sit down , there 's enough space to make that sitting comfortable . The obvious devices are simple enough . Builders and designers have thought of many . Walls become storage cabinets . The center of the floor is kept free , and a piece of furniture ? let 's say a couch and a bookcase ? angles out into the room to make an oasis and to reshape a badly proportioned space . High ceilings are brought down by wide cornices and horizontal lines ; low ceilings are made to seem higher by vertical lines . Light colors and bareness make small places seem larger , and the reverse reduces grandiose space to human scale . The shrinking house is filled with gadgets and well-thought-out storage devices to hide things out of the way . Furniture has grown smaller in scale , lighter in weight , and the growing informality of our lives has made it possible to eliminate much waste space and the chores of housekeeping . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he duds . Making a house comfortable seems to be mostly a matter of time . Things have to be switched around to suit . If we start from scratch , it may take five years , and if we 're remodeling it may take three , while a couple of years of living and planning in an apartment may get it nearer to what is wanted . It takes time to find out which good ideas turn sour . It takes time to figure out the inevitabilities that add up to comfort . I have a cousin who bought a Westchester house with a poor living room . It was a typical prewar Cape Cod Colonial , perched on a rock ledge , and cost in 1946 about what a development house costs today . It was designed by an architect , but emascu- lated by a stingy owner who cut costs and specifications ruthlessly . And it was full of all sorts of half-baked ideas hidden under a pleasant , ordinary facade . You entered the living room through a door in the lower right-hand corner , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and another window , evenly spaced . On the right wall in the center was a good-sized brick fireplace , and just beyond it was an ell , six feet deep and seven feet wide . In the back wall were two windows , in the front wall was another . The room was fifteen feet wide , thirty-four feet long , and the ceilings were less than eight feet high . It was an ugly room , too narrow for its length . The ell was far too small for the main space ; it was neither a real addition to the room nor the cozy nook it was supposed to be . It had to be bigger or smaller , and every time my cousin looked at it she was irritated by its uselessness . The low ceilings squeezed down on her , and the side walls pressed in . No matter where she put the furniture it was impossible to get a look at the marvelous view in back of the house , which stretched out over a low valley to rolling countryside . For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind 's eye and busily tore down walls and rebuilt them , trying to get good proportions into the room . She thought of building deep shelves and cabinets into the ell . That took out the unsightly hole , but made the room all the narrower . She thought of building in cabinets along one of the end walls , but that cut down the light . Everything would cost too much , but she had to do something ; so she called in one of her best and oldest friends , a man with more sense and imagination than any human being should be expected to have . Yes , all those changes could be done , he said , but let 's think about it a minute . So he built a fire in the fireplace , mixed a Manhattan , and the two sat down to get the feel of things . The architect lighted his pipe , flicking the match in the general direction of the fireplace . The big trouble was that the room was too long ; the two  | thought about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to live here , said the architect , so let 's forget the looks for a minute . Now where can we put the couch ? The room is too narrow for it to come sticking out from the wall . Besides , you like to feel a wall behind you when you 're sitting on a couch , and you ca n't build anything up behind one because it would make the room dark and the spaces worse . The only place for the couch is between the window and door on the left wall . You 're at an angle to the fireplace and that 's nice , for it gives the fire depth . Then , up near the hearth on the far side of the fireplace , you can put the big wing chair . But this made the room seem still narrower , and the architect slued his chair around to look at the two windows in the back wall , and the ell . You ca n't put the square grand piano in front of those windows , he said . It 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes on that piano , and the wood was nice , even if the legs were n't . She was blinking well going to have the thing around if she wanted . The architect nodded approvingly at this . You 've got to bring that stingy niche out into the room . Let 's shove the piano in there . The legs will be hidden behind the wing chair , and you 'll have light from the window for your music . He knew my cousin could n't read music , and he chuckled when she snorted at him . Now the room looked still narrower , with the ell filled up with the dark wood of the piano , which thrust its bulk out into the room . But it was pleasant to sit on the piano bench and look over its polished top into the room . The architect glanced at the couch , and then at the empty space between the door and the far window on the left wall . Have to fill that up , he said ? bring that wall out into the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put it by the door . My cousin poured another drink . Corner cupboards belong in corners , she said . You ca n't put it by the door . There is n't any corner . We 'll make one , do n't worry , said the architect , and the two of them horsed the corner cupboard next to the door . Its bulk balanced the wing chair  | now , but it did n't project into the room very far . The room looked all the narrower . You 'll have me living in a Pullman , said my cousin . I hate trains . No , I wo n't , said the architect . Now , let 's move the pine secretary from the front wall and put its back against the back of the cupboard . So they shoved that piece to the back of the room , first moving the table which formed the desk , then setting the pine case on top of it . The secretary projected into the room a good foot beyond the corner cupboard , and the two made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and left , and there was a little space about four feet square for a chair and a small table with a lamp . Sitting at the desk , you could look into the room and also watch the fireplace ; turning the other way , you could look out the window just behind you and through the second smaller one at your right shoulder . It was a marvelous place to sit and work , and the soft old pine glowed in the flood of light . And all at once the room was no longer too narrow , for it seemed to stop at the piano and the corner cupboard , beyond which was another space , with its axis at right angles to the main one . This space seemed to widen the room , for you did not notice the two corners ; you looked at the cupboard and piano instead . The spaces were now actually in perfect proportion , to themselves and to one another . Each piece of furniture was in its best possible position , and made useful places . Whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at the piano , or at the desk , or in other chairs in the room looking at these , you felt you were in a lovely room , full of delightful places where it was fun to be . Nothing like a good drink and a crackling fire to make your senses work , said the architect . I knew you 'd think of something instead of tearing up the whole place if you just sat down a minute , said my cousin . They were both inordinately pleased with themselves . In the next three years , other changes were made in the house . The door in the left wall near the corner cupboard led off into a  | garret with a sharply slanted roof . Although the floor area was big enough to make a room , you could stand erect only in its center . The pitch of the roof that faced the valley was ripped off , and a small screened porch was built ? six feet wide and twice as long ? the length of the room . It looked square at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house , and when the living room door was open , glimpses of the view came into that room . The garret became a wonderful little workroom and study . In the dining room the whole length of an interior wall was ripped out and a floor-to-ceiling wall of bookshelves was built in , adding warmth and wonder to an otherwise drab room in which it had not been a pleasure to eat . The room became a nice place to sit and read while you waited for things to finish cooking , and it was a good place to do paper work . The house lost its stinginess and took on a comfort and pleasantness matched by few . It was a house people liked to be in . Making places is hard enough when you start from scratch , but it 's still harder when you have to shuffle around architectural elements already there . With tricks you can minimize flaws . But effort and imagination are needed to make places in badly designed rooms . There is always a certain inevitability about the way you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions not originally thought of ? like the living room that was also a workroom and music room , or the dining room that doubled as a study and a second sitting room . Actually , almost every room becomes a sitting room when your concern is the making of places , ? adapted to special tasks and functions . Somehow it seems more pleasant that way . It means that you can enjoy doing things in every room in a house , and enjoy doing nothing in those rooms just as much . Near New York is a tremendous old dormitory that was converted into apartments during the Depression . The apartment on the top floor was particularly ugly , looking like a converted warehouse loft . Half the area was an enormous room thirty-six feet square , the roof sloping down almost to the floor on both  | sides , with two dormers cut in each and a great studio window in the end . The room was entered through a door in the center of the wall opposite the window . The room seemed vast and bare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dark and gloomy , except for the glare from the great window and from the dormers . There was lots of space , though , and that 's why the room was irresistible to a woman who made drawings ? small drawings which she did on a board in her lap with a tray of paints and brushes beside her . And she was small herself . The room was cold , even though the temperature was always high enough , and it was well insulated . But the clear north light and dark shadows , and the huge , smooth-painted surfaces of the wallboard nailed to the roof planes put a chill in the place . So the artist bought a few bolts of burlaplike monk 's cloth , borrowed a ladder and tacked the cloth to the walls and between the ceiling rafters . It took an awful lot of monk 's cloth . But the girl liked to recall that owners of castles used to hang up tapestries to make cold stone walls warmer , and while monk 's cloth was no longer thought to be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and absorbed light , softening it . In front of the great window she put a long refectory table , and at its left end she placed a comfortable upholstered chair , with her worktable beside it . Against one of the trusses that went clown through the floor she set a wicker chair , and under the chair and worktable she put an old hooked rug she 'd picked up at a roadside stand . Here were places for her to work and for a visitor to sit and watch her , the light from the window spilling into her lap , tables on both sides to hold her trappings . The windows on the right looked out on the green cover of a close , upsloping hill , and through them came very little light . Along the whole wall she built in deep , open shelves to hold her sketches , her paper and the sheafs of drawings and clippings every artist accumulates . She painted these shelves a warm white , to bring more light into the room , and on the top shelf she set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpture she had  | picked up through the years . On the end wall , between the studio window and the shelves , she angled an old upright piano her friends liked to bang on . The piano was battered as the tunes that came from it , but it made a pleasant bulk in the deep shadow . Near the trusses that came down in front of the shelves she put a ping-pong table to be used by her teen-age daughter and as a buffet and service table when she had enough guests to warrant eating at the refectory table . On the left , just as you came in the door , was a huge and ancient secretary that held a wailful of books . And farther in the lower left corner and at right angles to each other were two wide couches made of three-quarter beds on blocks , separated by the only dormer through which came pleasant afternoon sun . The couches were covered with a green homespun and piled with pillows , two sturdy bookcases making a headboard of the outside ends of the beds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dormer , was laid a Persian rug . By the truss was a deep green-leather club chair , beside it an enormous ottoman four feet across , of tooled and painted leather . The pillows were bright splashes of strong color , and the warm tones of the reddish rug connected the things into a group . In the center of the room was a second large Persian rug of brownish colors , a light and intricate pool on the darkly stained floors . The floors had once been painted a light mustard to make the room seem lighter , and it took a lot of work to get the paint off and down to the wood . The great studio window , eight feet wide and ten feet high , looked out on a green ridgetop , but the view was mostly sky , as through the other windows . When you came into the room the cold light glared into your eyes , but the rust-colored rug caught your attention , its warm colors changing as clouds and sun moved across the sky . Even the thinnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too much , making the room seem gloomy , and once you were in the room for a moment your eyes became accustomed to the brightness . The rugs and the monk 's cloth on the wall absorbed much of the light , warming and softening it at  | once . You had the feeling that you were in some vast and wonderful tent , the two groups of furniture scaling the whole to human size . In this room , color was used architecturally to shape and warm the space , and fabrics were the building material . Here again the room began with the making of a place ? a place to work . Then a second place was made where you could sit and talk , read , or watch the sky or changing light on the rugs or the monk 's cloth . Here was a room for living , adapted to the most important doings of those who lived there ? a work place with plenty of storage space and the basic things needed for singing and playing , eating and drinking , sitting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take place in one room , and yet it was logical and inevitable . Just across the Potomac from Washington is an ugly postwar apartment development , atrociously planned and typical of all such stupid building . One of the standard floor plans is particularly unlivable : a small entry four feet square , opening directly into a dining alcove eight feet square , which enlarges into a living room twelve feet wide and fourteen feet long , which runs into a hall four feet wide and ten long that leads into the bath and is flanked by two small bedrooms . The ceilings are too low , the window sills are too high , the walls are painted that ugly shade known as " landlord cream , " and the proportions of the spaces and openings are all graceless . From front door to bathroom door is a distance of thirty-six feet , narrow and compressing , and one tenant calls it the " Memorial Tunnel . " The dining ell and living room form a narrow , unpleasant unit , the first too small for a dining table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch . One couple with two children and a need for a workroom decided to make the living and dining space into a sleeping space as well , and give the small bedroom over to the kids , using the larger as a workroom . In such small and vile apartments a lot of space is often freed if the living room is also used for sleeping .  | There was only one place to put a bed ? in the jog on the inside wall where the dining space became living area . With the couch there , you could look out the windows , at the end wall of the living room , and down the hall . The jog was only three feet , so a chest of drawers was set to extend the jog , its front facing into the ell . When the bed was covered with a grayed tan cover and piled with pillows it became a pleasant corner . A sandedclown , two-drawer oak filing cabinet along the inside wall made a firm bedside table . As the ell was too small for dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-two inches , edged with oak lath and set on iron sawhorses ? was set before the windows . Above a second couch along the end wall was placed a row of four bright-colored sketches , and three more were arrayed down the hall wall . They looked like a single row of colorful pictures , and seemed to widen the far end of the room . The two small windows and the dividing sections of wall were curtained with a cocoa-colored linen , that wall becoming a unit . At the jog of the wall near the dining ell was set a second chest of drawers . A bookcase was placed on the back wall of the dining ell , its shelves beginning at the floor . The chests , the bookcase , the bed frame and the table legs were painted a flat black . The dining ell became an extension of the entry , a place for storing things . The table and its deck chairs became a pleasant place to sit and talk as well as eat . The furniture jutting out into the room and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But after it was used a while this way it was found more pleasant to move the bed into the workroom and put the two children together , a screen between their beds . Two wooden cots at right angles to each other , divided by the filing cabinet and piled with pillows as well as bolsters , took the place of the bed . A tall lamp on the filing cabinet closed in the corner , making a still more comfortable place to read . The main space became a place for both living and dining , and the ell became a handsome extension ? backed by the solid tapestry of book bindings ? and a storage center for the  | paraphernalia of the whole room . It was , somehow , an inevitable arrangement , working well for a single person or a dozen . Here again , furniture was used architecturally , as were pictures on the wall and a lamp . And it all began with making places . Once settled upon , everything else fell into place . But it took time and changes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more or less designed by architects . But they were not well designed as architecture , nor were they tailored to the needs of the people who were to live in them . These people were the ones that did the real architectural job , defining the spaces for the uses they were put to , making places to satisfy the needs and wants of those who lived there . Architecture in these rooms was not a matter of construction . For architecture , in its truest meaning , is not a matter merely of construction or of principles but a way of doing with space those , things that satisfy our impulses , that suit our needs , that add richness to our living . Such things can be done to the spaces in a hall bedroom as well as to the most wonderful of freshly built houses . Architecture is a concern with living and the places where that living is done .  | EVERYTHING we do involves the use of paraphernalia . All our actions involve setting things down , including our bodies . A chair takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind will hold the book we are reading , our glasses or our false teeth . As a tool-using animal we have advanced so far that many of the things we use ? a clock , a desk , a vase , for example ? are also pleasant to look at when we are not using them . Some of the things we use are not things we want to look at , and while this may not be logical , it is human . A housewife wants to get away from her pots and pans when she is not using them , although the utensils may not look so repulsive if they are hung up neatly . Some of the things we use have to be put away for reasons of safety , like a typewriter that will become clogged with dust if left exposed , and the sight of which may unpleasantly remind us of work that should be done . Also , we need places to set things which have no use but are simply good to look at . For most of us , setting things down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinets and ledges . There never seem to be enough such places , and they are never large enough . Tom Robinson , the Boston architect , has brought up the point that some of us do n't like a lot of shelves and tables around , preferring to hide everything out of sight , while others really enjoy a room full of clutter and odds and ends that remind us of past tinges . Chances are that most of us are on the fence . We like some things around and handy , other things tidied away , our liking changing from time to time without much reason or sense for deciding one way or another . But whether we like the bareness of a monk 's cell or the clutter of a junk shop ? and most of us like both ? we need lots of places for setting things down . Few of us go along with that silly dictum that preaches a place for everything and everything in its place . We want to set things down without having to think too much about it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess if we do . To normal human animals too much orderliness is as irritating as none at all . Even so , we have our own way of doing things , and our places for doing them should suit us , not somebody else . Here 's another reason for putting into nooks and alcoves the paraphernalia for our more private doings . It 's easier to do paper work on a desk that can be left undisturbed than on the dining-room table , where it has to be gathered up three times a day . Paper work is one of the hardest things to plan for , desks being badly designed for the storage and easy arrangement of papers , writing tools and all the rest . And if two people in the family do a lot of paper work , the desk is a clutter ? so much so that the answering of a letter or the writing of a check becomes an irritating chore we prefer to put off , the procrastinating of which makes for still more irritation . Few of us keep proper track of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rubber bands , paper clips and clippings , and the result is confusion . What 's more , the usual household desk is normally set flat against a wall , so we do n't enjoy sitting there . There are few  | things so inhibiting as staring at a wall only a few inches away . A desk so set is a place where you perch , not settle down to get something done . The simple change of pushing the end of the desk against a wall rather than its backside , can place us so that we can look into the room or out a window , and we are more willing to sit there for a while . At the same time , any clutter we may choose to leave on the desk top is not so easily seen from the room , the usual household desk having a superstructure that adequately screens the work surface . Most superstructures are poorly designed for their storage job , with cubbies and drawers and pigeonholes of poor size and shape . The best new such design I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running the length of the desk . Vertical pieces of pine divided the box into ten-inch sections , and these were slotted every inch , one-eighth inch hardboard sheets sliding in to make shelves . A typed strip was taped to the edge of each shelf to make a miniature filing system . A smaller box made the same way sat on a near-by shelf , holding the various kinds of typewriter paper . A series of small square boxes not much bigger than those cigars come in had been mounted on a square pole , holes having been cut in their bottoms , and the boxes then strung on the pole like so many beads . Wooden blocks kept them about six inches apart along the pole , which was fastened from shelftop to ceiling , and the various odds and ends of writing paraphernalia had been tossed inside . I have seen ordinary desk file boxes fastened to the undersides of a shelf for additional desk storage . This was simply done by screwing quarter-inch strips along the top sides of the boxes , then screwing L-shaped lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooves , although a hardware store can supply factory-made metal sliders that work as well . At the same desk was a shelf full of small cardboard boxes obtained from the local stationery store and used for the filing of snapshots , clippings , visiting cards , coupons and all those various odd bits of paper we want to keep but never have a place for . A larger set of the same  | boxes was used by the housewife to store various precious catalogues and pamphlets . To keep the boxes from showing fingermarks , she had covered them with cloth , stuck on with liquid cement , a prettification most of us would have felt unnecessary but the doing of which filled an idle afternoon . By such devices we bring order to our chaos , and the secret of success seems to be many narrow shelves or slots of varying depth or width , several easily get-at-able trays rather than drawers and a number of bins or boxes that can be filed on a shelf like books or stacked up somewhere , yet still easily at hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost always the smallness of the desk top . If the desk can be got at from both sides , a surface forty inches wide is not too big and makes it possible for two people to work together on opposite sides , still leaving plenty of room for books and papers . A more convenient width , though , is one that can be reached across without rising , about thirty inches seeming most comfortable . At such a desk , work can be spread out sideways , and the minimum length for real comfort is about four feet . Six feet is even better , for we can reach out about a yard to each side without stretching too much . Because our arms swing in an arc , a kidney-shaped desk top is marvelously efficient for some . One of the best I 've seen was made in the shape of a grand-piano top , the end toward the keyboard against a wall , the worker sitting in the curve , his work spread out all around him . There are many things we like to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sorting stamps to assembling models , or making out a tax return . We may have a set of books or a sheaf of notes to refer to , and we need a separate place for this reference material where it can be consulted easily without disturbing the thing on which we are working . This secondary space is often as important as the desk itself ; it is this material we are most apt to want to leave spread out , for it usually takes time to organize and sort it . A desk is usually  | not enough . We need a place to work , not just a surface to work on , or storage space . By putting one end of a desk against a wall , we usually segregate an area where a chair can go . To get more space for spreading things out it is often easy to build in shelves to one side and behind the chair . We usually like to face away from a corner , or out from an ell , which ranges such shelves along the walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forming an extension of the desk itself ? a sort of counter . Shelves below , when fitted with doors , can be used for things you want to hide away . The counter needs to be ten inches or a foot wide to hold papers easily , and if it is fifteen or eighteen inches wide , there is room for more bulky things . Such a counter can be extended into other parts of the room ,  | joining the work space to the main part . Quite often a large desk can be planned to fit into a window corner , counters behind and to the side adding to the working area . Such a desk is a wonderful place to work at ; its surface is always flooded with light , and a glance up now and then into the distance and the greenery will rest the eyes . The windows should face away from the south , however , or be protected by wide eaves , for direct sunlight on work is too glaring , blinding most of us . By putting an end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall space but are in a position to make the desk much sturdier than usual by building it in . Consequently , we also eliminate legs , for the surface can be fastened to the wall with a single support at the free end , thus providing much more room for our knees . The support can be a simple post , or a T- or L-shaped piece made with a couple of boards fastened to the floor for extra steadiness . A filing cabinet or small chest of drawers makes a sturdy support . ( See appendix ) Such desks , tables and counters can be built of three-quarterinch plywood faced with a veneer of fine wood , and edged with one- or two-inch lathing of solid pieces of the same wood . Below eye level the lathing looks best when its top edge is flush with the top of the table . Above eye level , best looks result when the bottom edge of the lathing is flush with the undersurface of counter or shelf . These sturdy tables and counters are easily built along the wall of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . The table need not always be rectangular ; it may vary in length or width , according to possible uses . Small end tables and side tables are often rickety , endangering lamps and wellloved objects , and are usually too small to hold a magazine as well as an ash tray . A long and narrow counter gives much more space where things can be set down , and it is less precarious . Such arrangements also tend to make more flexible in arrangement the movable things in the room , for no matter where we might happen to place a chair , there is likely to be a surface  | close at hand . As well , such counters and tables , by their very amount of surface , help to keep a room from looking cluttered . Because they are against a wall , therefore usually behind us when we are sitting down , or unnoticed when we are looking out the window at something more interesting , they are not annoying to those who do n't like the looks of a lot of things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a part of the wall , their plain lines and natural wood surfaces not conflicting with more decorative and colorful pieces . Inconspicuous , they serve as part of the background for any period piece of furniture , offering an impervious surface to a glass or ash tray , which more highly finished pieces often fail to do . Such surfaces give us a place for things we use , but there is still the problem of those things we simply want to look at and which are usually breakable . Some may find houseroom on the counter , but a flapping curtain or the eager hand of a child can do them in . There 's a need for a place to set things down , in sight but out of reach . Perhaps the best such surface is the ledge , a sort of widened plate rail . In shaping space , we have seen ways to give it depth and breadth and size . But we have not talked much about giving space height or form . We are accustomed to having interior space go up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling is high or low , and that is as far as we usually concern ourselves with the vertical dimension . But to give space form we must consider height . We are more conscious of height if the ceiling level is not flat or if it varies . A ledge makes possible the varying of ceiling height without extensive construction . In ordinary rectangular rooms , some sense of height results when furniture of varying tallness and bulk is set against the wall , where its shape is silhouetted against the usually lighter background . Various hangings , pictures and other objects fastened on the wall give further up-and-down direction to the spaces , as do the frames of doors and windows and various wall coverings with vertical lines , such as paneling or wallpaper . The  | ceiling acts as a lid on all this . There is no feeling of spaces overhead but merely the sense of the tops of things ranged against the walls around the room . The walls and what is against them are simply a frame for the enclosed space . To order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ledges can be used to bring the overhead spaces down on the walls . As a result , the overhead spaces in the center of the room seem to be pushed upward . The tops of doors and windows extend up to the ledge , giving them a direction and an end and making the walls without ledges seem taller by contrast . A ledge marks a definite change from wall to overhead spaces , giving both a distinct form . The most pleasing ledges seem to be those that are just above your head when you step under them , perhaps only a few inches over six feet , say six feet four inches to six feet eight inches . If the ceiling is only eighteen inches or so above the ledge , the ledge usually need not be much more than a foot wide and six inches thick , a sort of extended cornice or valance reaching along the whole wall . When the ceiling goes still farther above the ledge , the ledge is often wider ? perhaps several feet ? expanding like the counter into large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or branches can be set . A ledge also serves to tie projections and furrings into the main structure , unifying it . Window and door hangings , as well as the openings themselves , become more a part of the structure . Most windows and doors usually extend upward too far as it is , seeming to be mere holes cut in the structure ? a condition acknowledged in most houses when the window shade is pulled part way down over the panes . If we shield a portion of the window , nullifying its usefulness , there is little point in going to the expense of building the useless part . Perhaps the most pleasant thing about ledges is that by bringing a surface down close over our heads , the room spaces are made to seem larger by contrast . The room comes closer to human scale . But the greatest advantage of ledges is what can be set on  | them . While hangings can be depended from them , saving the cost of curtain boxes , they are much more useful as places to put things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's way . Dearly prized vases , bowls , jugs , bits of sculpture and other handiworks of art and craftsmanship are in easy view , their varying size and shape restoring that pleasant up and down which results when furniture is profiled against a wall . Equally , the furniture now becomes not merely an outline but a solid object with form , and the objects in a room become no longer simply a frame around the space but a part of it . Ledges are simple to build , their undersurfaces plastered or finished with various sheet materials , their outer edges made of boards . In most cases there is no need to finish the upper surface at all , the cheapest of sheet materials being strong enough to support anything likely to be put there . The ledge adds to the livability of the room in other ways than the elimination and ordering of clutter . One of these is that ledges act as dust catchers , for the upward flow of warm air carries dust up to the ceiling and then down the planes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ledge . Then too , the downward flow of air is forced out into the room , preventing a longer sweep which might cause drafts . And if the ledges are surfaced with sound-absorbing materials , the bounce of noise is caught , reducing boom and echo . A room with ledges is cleaner , quieter and less drafty than one without . Equally useful is the flexibility of lighting made possible by a ledge . Lights set within it can shine downward through boxes cut into the ledge , or its undersurface can be partly glazed . The ledge forms a natural cove for light reflected upward , as well . Lights can be spotted along the ledge where needed , for general or spot lighting , thus eliminating the need for the various unsightly but often necessary wall fixtures and cutting down to a minimum the need for lamps . Because the installation is hidden , expensive brackets and wiring are unnecessary , a few sockets and switches being all that 's needed to make countless and changeable  | lighting effects . Ledge lighting is the cheapest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best thing about ledge lighting is not that it adds candle power to a room but that the sources can be placed at spots other than those through which natural daylight comes . Daylight can give one aspect to a room , while ledge lighting can provide an entirely different one for after dark . Because lights can be placed anywhere over a large area , without dependence on floor plugs or table tops , a room can be given new form with light and shadow . This chance for change adds to the ways to vary a room 's aspect , providing a source which can run the whole range from brightness to dimness and without the usual glare that is the disadvantage of floor and table lamps . By putting the general lighting in the ledge , the light coming from lamps can be more flexibly arranged to fit needs precisely , focusing sharply on book or paper without having to light the room itself . By varying the color of the bulbs in the ledge , softer and warmer light can brighten the room , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By carefully making places where paper work can be done , we have led to the solution of the whole problem of setting things down , eliminating much of the clutter in the process . With builtin tables , counters and ledges we have added vastly to the number of places where things can be set and stored . With ledges we have made a safe place for those things whose main function is beauty , at the same time providing a light source which does away with the need of some of the more expensive brackets and lamps . We have added enormously to the flexibility of the room , made it easier to clean and keep looking neat , and made it quieter and less drafty . But more important from the standpoint of our comfort , we have given the room a form and a sense of space by adding to it the dimension of height . By providing a spacious and variable light source , we have made it possible to vary the room spaces still more with light and shadow . We have also brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time adding to its spaciousness with overhead spaces . Now it is possible to change the aspect of a room not only with nooks and alcoves but with ledges , counters and tables . It is now possible to move furniture more freely , to give the room one aspect in daylight and a variety of others in artificial light . By building in extra and useful surfaces around the walls , and on them , we have reduced the number of things in a room . This marks a tremendous saving in cost , greatly reducing the need for those expensive and cluttering objects that must be cared for . As a result , a room becomes more spacious and useful , actually a part of what we do there and not merely an inefficient frame for it .  | SO FAR , we 've been speaking of rooms as places where we settle down , often as not with a sigh of relief . And we 've been concerned with making that sighing fall as comfortable as possible , seeing to it that there are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as we gather together enough strength . The room we 've had in mind has been for quiet pursuits , the silence disturbed only by the turning of a page , the scratching of a pen or the murmur of low voices . It 's the living room we 've had in mind , where small groups of people often gather and the chink of ice and slap of cards is not unknown . But we have a complication here . Many of the things we do in such rooms require services and equipment that are performed and kept in other parts of the house . In most living rooms such simple matters as the serving of a drink or a few sandwiches involve trips to the kitchen . There may be a trip to the hall closet for a table , to some distant cupboard for the movie projector , to another room for an extra chair . Some of these nuisances we may have solved with built-in  | tables , counters and cupboards ; others we have solved by providing plenty of seats . We can solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room . But we still have a problem of function , of what the room is to be used for . Many of our activities are noisy . So are school-age children , by their very nature . There has been some recent architectural concern directed to this problem , whereby the " living room " actually becomes the " busy activity room " and quieter pursuits are shunted off to a smaller secondary " quiet room " which may have a fireplace and seats for perhaps half a dozen people . The idea seems to be to make a place for parents to retreat to when the teen-agers invade . The " busy activity room , " then , would be equipped with a ping-pong table , a shuffleboard design cut in the floor , perhaps some shop tools , a shooting gallery and a large collection of jump records . The outmoded game room of the Twenties has moved upstairs and is now combined with the workshop , hobby room and bar . The trouble with such an approach seems to be that we are merely putting new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A room is thus designated for a more or less specific purpose , and all the rooms are then limited to their assigned purposes , as far as possible . There is no argument with the belief that rooms should be designed for what we do in them . But emphasis should not be placed on minor or special activities , or concentrated on such transitory problems as teen-age entertainment ? periods through which youngsters pass quickly . The fact of the matter seems to be that most rooms should be designed for our complete range of activities and that noisy and messy ones should be relegated to out-of-the-way , or private , places . Rambunctious doings deserve space in the house , but not necessarily the best parts of the house or the biggest rooms . The main rooms of the house should still be planned for such occasionally uproarious actions as sitting , reading , talking , paper work , eating , drinking and watching the fire . And doing this need not mean making a one-room apartment out of each room in the house , although  | we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most rooms . We are still concerned with the making of places , not with the designing of rooms to which we can hitch a name . Let 's take such an activity as listening to music . Sometimes we like background music while we eat or work or read , but often enough we just like to sit in a chair with a drink in our hands and listen to the pleasing sounds . Usually a single loudspeaker will distribute the sound enough if it is mounted between the places where we sit and where we eat . The switches should be located near the phone , so it can be turned down , and the phone should not be too far from the kitchen or dining place , where we spend so much of our time . That puts the phonograph somewhere in the connecting passage between the rooms . If the youngster in the household wants to listen to the latest popular singer , a second phonograph in the bedroom seems to be the simplest answer . The problem of the radio is usually solved without trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television is wearing off , the set no longer needs to be the center of attention ; and because the medium is particularly distracting , perhaps the best place for it is in a secondary room , or in an alcove . People like to congregate around the set , and as watching it is pretty much all-absorbing , it should be where it wo n't disturb those who do n't want to look . For some obscure reason the dining space works out to be a particularly desirable location . Better results are usually produced when radio , phonograph and television equipment is built into the walls or cabinets , the speaker mounted on a panel set in a sturdy sound box , the turntable , tuner , amplifier and viewing screen placed where they are most convenient . Any radio store can supply you with equipment of any quality , and instructions as to its installation . For people who like to play music there is nothing so wonderful as a place where music stands and instruments can be left within reach , and where there is plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience as well . An alcove of a room is ideal  | for this , with the piano facing into the room , the music stands beside it or out in the room itself . When people are playing music everyone else about is usually listening , so that the main room is a logical place for such an arrangement . No special consideration need be focused on the problem of sitting arrangements for a large group of people in the room we have been talking about . Somebody always gravitates to the couch , and someone else always slings a chair in a position to suit . Then there 's always the floor , the counters , the benches and window seats . A room divided into various places makes it possible for a number of conversations to be carried on at once , and there 's always one space big enough for most crowds ? usually the one near the fireplace . For quiet reading we need room for a glass , a plate , perhaps other things , and a good light . A sturdy bench pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and narrow shape puts more things within reach without too much stretching . Most of us like a cozy feeling of enclosure when we read ? one reason why reading in bed is so popular ? and if where we are lounging is backed by a wall , another large mass is at our side and there is a partial sense of enclosure on the other side , we are most content . A table rounding the end of a couch ? or a pier at one hand with the wall on the other ? is a simple way of creating the feeling . It 's just the same as the feeling of sitting in a wing chair , but it is more spacious . We have noted several ways of joining and separating the places that we make , keeping in mind a central space with adjuncts to it . And yet one thing that we should work to avoid is trying to cram all our living into a single room . We like a feeling of change in the places where we live , and nothing is quite so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place we 've spent the day . All of us are miserable if we have to live in a hotel room for a length of time , or in a one-room apartment . Here 's a disadvantage of the house built on a single level , for the mere act of going upstairs marks for us a transition .  | We have tried to avoid this feeling with alcoves and with ells . But we can separate places still more completely , yet still preserve the sense of large spaces , by the use of partial walls and partitions . We can link the smaller places together . But more important , we can separate them completely with halls and entries .. The room we have been talking about should be a pleasant place in which to eat and drink , even if the regular dining space is somewhere else . This may mean the provision for secondary cooking and service equipment , and a hall is a particularly convenient place for such installations . As well , there is the problem of giving other sorts of work space ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a gardener 's greenhouse ? houseroom . A hall can be a good place for such doings . One of the first things to disappear when the house began to shrink was the pantry . A combination of work space and storage space , this was one of the most useful places in the old houses and marked a transition from the kitchen to the dining room . The pantry was rarely very large , and yet it was amazing how much time was spent there ? watching as someone arranged a tray , or cut flowers , or polished silver . The cooky jar was usually there , and the bottles and bar supplies ? and a second refrigerator , filled with leftover desserts , and fruit , and soda pop . It was a wonderful place , and its feeling and its uses have a place in today 's houses . Passages are customarily expanded into enclosed terraces in today 's houses . Usually a long and narrow space supposed to be a pleasant place to sit , it is actually a hall with chairs that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such halls can be divided and widened into various sorts of work spaces . One of the best ways to expand the space is with a bay , which is a kind of alcove , and one of the best bays is one that takes the form of a thirty-sixty triangle . Not much square footage is involved , and yet chairs and tables are usually so placed at an angle that people can get by without making one feel cramped . On the interior side of a passage , a nook can add still more room . If  | what you do there makes a mess , the nook can be closed off with doors . The halls leading off the living room can be good places for the service equipment you want conveniently at hand ? the bar supplies , tea service , a hot plate , a sink for washing up . Such a place takes the strain off the kitchen before and after meals , the reason for a pantry in the first place . Or some of the hall space can be given over to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kept , where the phone is , and a bulletin board , perhaps even a permanent table or work space . Such space can become a playroom , where all the toys are kept , and the playpen , and the scooter . Best of all , such places can be where you can ride your hobbies . There 's something pleasant about being in a place where people are enthusiastically busy . The clutter of tools and partly finished objects have a fascination for most of us . Disorderliness does n't seem to matter . And because a hall is a place you pass through , a visitor can politely pause to admire the shell collection or the sandwich glass , or ignore the mess , without being forced to look at it constantly all the time he 's there .  | Particularly interesting are the places where artists and writers work , with the brushes and paints or books and piles of paper about . Artists and writers are particularly skillful at making places to suit themselves ? careful to see that the light is right , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the necessary paraphernalia is stored with order and within easy reach . The same is true of a workshop , or a darkroom , or a greenhouse . And because the purpose of such places is to get something done , a great deal of stuff is crammed into a small place . People do n't like to feel crowded when they 're working , and such places usually have a feeling of space but are generally quite small . And how the spaces makes one feel is important . One of the places at Taliesin where Frank Lloyd Wright works consists of a desk built into a windowed corner . Seated at it , you look out along a stone wall and across a flagged terrace into some trees . Through the window to the left is a view across a valley , and at your left shoulder a stone pier rises to support the roof . Another stone pier rises up from the far right corner of  | the desk , and a doorway looks through into the light and shadow of another room . A stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant to sit there in a chair with your back to the wall and look across the desk into the valley . In another room a desk juts out from a glassed wall , and seated there , you look through another window onto a terrace . Many of the tables at Taliesin are placed so that there is a view in front of you when you look up and a second view to right or left , entirely different . But the unusual thing about these places is that they are so small ? a chair or two , some working surface and storage space . These few square feet are sometimes in a corner of a room , but they are as often a more or less separate place , secluded , around a corner or at an angle through a doorway . Many work spaces require a water supply and employ certain equipment better kept out of sight . A sink can be installed in a wooden counter top , the space underneath fitted with batten doors so that things can be hidden away . But hiding things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarger , or drill press , or icebox can more easily be set in a niche facing away from the room or passage . You ca n't see it , but it 's easy to get at . By putting at least a part of the service facilities and work spaces in alcoves or in a hall , the tranquility of places where actions are more sedentary is preserved , yet at the same time needed things are kept within reach . By more or less joining one space to another we can preserve the unity of a place , yet still give it the feeling of size . There is no substitute for sheer size for giving a room a feeling of spacious luxury , but vastness can be inconvenient if we have work to do there . A room thus becomes a series of linked spaces to which we can not attach a , single name . In one we may sit , read , listen to music , eat , drink and do paper work ; in the hall we may make tea or model airplanes ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book , or play ping-pang . The activities may be related , or quite disparate . The main problem seems to be planning for a house  | where we live everywhere and not just in a place called the " living room . " And because there are times when we want to get away from where we are at any particular moment , there is a need for providing a place to go . By concentrating on the making of places , we have made that possible . There is no one favorite spot , but several . For convenience we may pin names on these various places and rooms , and it may seem an incongruity when we find ourselves eating in the living room , napping in the dining room , cooking in the hall , or playing cards in the bedroom . But strangest of all is that we do such things in the most conventional of houses , anyway . It seems sensible to plan for such odd eventualities from the first . If we do , the whole house takes on a shape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms and the places that we make in them . Perhaps it is still more peculiar when we realize that such an approach has centuries of tradition behind it . Today we have the skills , materials and sense to make the approach bear fruit .  | WE HAVE BEGUN to consider rooms and the various separated spaces that we make as places for our more sedentary activities , with the noisier and messier of our activities shunted off to halls and nooks . But we 've also thought of the places that we make as ones where we have cocktails and tea . If we 're busy doing desk work , we might as well have lunch there . Certainly the main room is the place where our parties center , and where people settle at a buffet supper . Such activities require some of that equipment and service which we have more or less relegated to the hall or the pantry . But before enthusiasm has us installing extra sinks and refrigerators , we better take a look at the tray , that portable table without legs . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible to arrange a bowl of flowers at the kitchen sink . The home bartender may revel in the idea of a special icebox for seltzer and ice cubes , but the one in the kitchen may do as well . And while an ardent photographer may rightly need a second sink , the painter and sculptor can get along with pitchers and glasses of water ? perhaps a bucketful when work gets extra heavy . Many such built-in luxuries become rarely used expensive waste . A cheaper and more portable luxury is often a big tray . Pleasant drinking involves a certain amount of paraphernalia , and the handsomest and most useful of all is standard bar equipment : the tall mixing glass with its metal shaker top , the metal  | measure with the one-ounce pony at one end and the one and onehalf-ounce jigger at the other , a bar spoon , a wire strainer and a lemon squeezer . A bowl for the fine bar sugar , a board and paring knife for slicing lemons , a corkscrew and bottle opener and can punch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these complete the fanciest of equipment . For some reason , wives do n't think an ice tray is pretty enough to bring into the living room , so we may need a bowl for ice . All this will fit conveniently on a single tray , leaving room for the various bottles . We may need a second one for all the glasses , and a third for bowls and plates of food . The bar tools can be stored away on the tray itself so that we wo n't waste a second in mixing up a drink . The same thing goes for the tea tray with its sugar bowl and spoon , cream pitcher , butter plate , jar of cinnamon sticks , lemon saucer and teapot ? or for the breakfast tray with the various pots of jam and jellies , salt and pepper , sugar bowl and extra spoons . Another one comes in handy for the mustard pot , Worcestershire sauce , ketchup and horse radish . By keeping such oddments on trays , all ready to be plunked intact on the table , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra trips . Trays were probably one of the first things man invented for his comfort , lavishing on them his burgeoning love for decoration . It 's only recently that we 've succeeded in making them ugly and useless . Trays practically disappeared from our living with the departure of the serving maid , and when they came back they were all fitted out with bins and compartments and dishes , most of them shrunken in size and poor in shape . They had been frowned on , too , because no two of them ever seemed to he the same size ? a necessity when sets of everything were demanded ? and also because the old ones were too large for our dinky coffee tables and end tables . For a while there , trays were so small as to be of no use at all . We 've got away from most of that by now , though , and we can buy light , strong , handsome trays in almost any size and ma- terial . Perhaps the best bar tray is one about two feet long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two- or three-inch rim to keep things from sliding off . It 's possible to set flush with the top of the tray edge a thin sheet of wood or hardboard into which circles have been cut to hold the bottles . This keeps them from jiggling , but most of us find such fitments a nuisance , preferring to carry the tray carefully , and trusting to the rim for stability . Such fitted boards come in handy for breakfast in bed , perhaps , if no place else , the holes and fittings patterned after the trays used on air liners . The best trays seem to be the simplest , no matter how fancifully decorated , round , oval or rectangular ones being most adaptable for all our uses , in a range of sizes from the three-footer only the old man can carry to the one-footer a toddler can tote . Now that it 's possible to have tables and counters of decent size again , most of us feel that trays ca n't be too big , enormous ones being set right down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals or small children around , tray stands will raise them up to that zone of untouchability the young and rambunctious are trained to respect . Old-fashioned luggage racks with the canvas straps are usually more stable than the gadgety stands made for trays . If the trays are big enough and the stands are sturdy enough , a large and flexible supply of coffee and end tables is automatically at hand . Some amateur bartenders like to mix drinks in the kitchen ; but guests like to watch the cheerful blending of ingredients , and they also have a right to know what 's going into their drinks ? reasons why it 's good to bring the makings in on a tray , with the liquor in the original containers . There are times when we ca n't afford to offer our guests bonded bourbon or one of the better blends , but rather than buy cheaper whiskies , most of us prefer to serve long gin or rum drinks , or beer , in winter making hot wine drinks and in summer making punches , spritzers and coolers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they look nice on the tables  | and counters when not in use , as do jars and vases ; so there 's usually not much of a storing problem . Some designers have made vertical slots for trays and platters , but few of us own that many trays . It 's usually simpler to stack them on a wide shelf or put them in those slatted racks built to hold the pot lids . For trays that are kept loaded with things a series of deep shelves , made large enough to hold the biggest tray , provides good storage . Some people like lots of little trays for cocktail parties , one for each guest and big enough to hold a glass , a sandwich or two and a napkin . But such overgrown coasters are generally all the same size and rarely more than a foot across , so they can be stacked on a shelf with the plates . Trays deserve so much consideration because with them can be transported those things we might want to keep stored away out of sight , and also because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For pleasant drinking and random eating some such storage may be needed . But open shelves are the best and simplest places for putting things out of the way . It 's a nuisance to have to be constantly opening doors and pulling out drawers to get at the things we want . Some open shelves are needed in most rooms ? for glasses and cups , ash trays and bottles ? and are inconspicuous when no one has to look at what 's on them but at the back of the shelves instead . A dozen footsquare shelves run from floor to ceiling , with varied heights from six to twelve inches , can take care of most of the things likely to be needed . By using trays and storing some tableware and glassware in places other than those used primarily for cooking and eating , we provide for easy service and add to comfort without installing expensive equipment or cabinetwork and without using a lot of space for storage . By storing things where we want to use them , we cut down the amount of storage space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these seem to work out best when near one of the built-in desks or tables , whose surfaces can be used as work spaces . As well , such shelves should be placed so  | that they are handy to the fireplace , or passages leading to decks or terraces , or openings between rooms , so that they can be got at easily from either space . With supplies near at hand and an appreciative audience , a bartender does n't mind taking time to make the drinks carefully and well , or to make those that take some mixing , like a Planter 's Punch , or Silver Fizz , or Whisky Sour . Such provision also gets the bartender out of the kitchen most of the time while food has to be prepared . But the added convenience takes on most meaning in those first moments when we get home and ca n't wait to flop down in a good chair with a perfect drink in hand . Those first moments of relaxation after being busy all day compose a time when one most wants to be comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us arrives with the twilight when the kids are in bed or out playing . And because it 's pleasant to watch the sun go down , while sipping a cocktail in fall and spring  | or a taller drink in summer , the best place for before- and afterdinner sipping seems to be one that looks to the west . Light from the setting sun is low in the sky and often glaring , and we might feel more content when we watch the light fade as it is reflected on a wall , or see the shadows lengthen to the south and west or through the branches of a tree . Such a place can have a western aspect rather than a direct western exposure ? a place where we simply become aware of the day 's end . One of the most pleasant I 've seen was an alcove off a larger room , scarcely more than eight feet square . Banks of windows and doors opened under deep overhangs to the north , west and east . The couch and a few chairs faced south into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was room on the floor between the two rooms for a couple of children to play . You could sit there in brightness watching them , and see the light die in the large room , the shadows lengthen on the walls and roof . And if you were sitting in the larger room , you could see the fading brightness in the alcove , watch shadows deepening in the hillfolds through the windows to the south . It 's at day 's beginning and day 's end , and at quiet moments between the day 's activities , that we are most aware of our surroundings , most desirous of comfort . It is then , when we are willing to wait for the coffee to perk , or the tea to steep , or the shaker to chill , that we most appreciate having the makings near at hand . Then , a single trip with a tray is not too much effort , but the thought of a dozen trips back and forth means one is likely to forgo the pleasure of a glass or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of the magazines most of us are happy with bowls of olives , raw celery , carrots or cauliflower , and maybe popcorn , potato chips , or nuts . Cheese spread on slices of apple or pear tastes good sometimes , and when we 're really hungry a loaf of crusty bread waiting to be sliced and a couple of wedges of cheese generally fill the bill . The simplest foods seem to be best with drinks , with perhaps a fancy one once in a while , made in a chafing dish or frying pan ,  | right in plain sight of everybody . And if something wrapped in bacon needs broiling , people can do it themselves in front of the fireplace . Our ancestors did all their cooking in the fireplace , and there 's no reason why the backyard barbecue ca n't be brought indoors during the winter . The skewers and long-handled forks work even better in the fireplace , where the smoke goes properly up the chimney and there 's a dry clean hearth to sit on . Some nails on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick courses at different heights in the back wall of the opening , and some short lengths of pipe sawed lengthwise and set into the sides to hold a spit , convert a fireplace into an indoor barbecue . You can rest a long-handled frying pan right on the coals , or bury potatoes in the ashes , just as you do over a campfire . An old-fashioned crane and pots make it possible to make stews , and a Dutch oven means you can bake beans or bread ; but it 's usually easier and better to do these things in a modern stove . Fireplaces are fine for grilling sausages or hamburger ; and if you can find some old grapevines to toss on the coals , you can broil a steak over their searing flame and long glow ? as does the Burgundian peasant ? supplementing its wonderful taste with a salad and casserole made in the kitchen , just as you would if the barbecue were out back . Some people forgo the pleasure of fireplace cooking because they 're afraid it will make a mess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will collect most of the drippings and is perfectly safe if you keep an eye on it , and that bricks can be scrubbed clean in a minute with a little soap and water . A fireplace is wonderful for making hot drinks ? like toddies or buttered rum ? and the poker is handy for the sizzling plunge , just as it was in the days when the drinks were first invented . And while you might not want to cook in one of the old iron pots , they 're wonderful for making mulled wine . A fireplace can be used for more than roasting apples or toasting marshmallows , and it 's most fun when cooking is simplest .  | All this can be built into the places where we live without much actual construction and without spoiling their familiar looks . But the result is not quite the same as a formal drawing room or the living rooms we 're apt to see in the horsier magazines . One hardgoing lady I heard about told her puzzled decorator that she did n't know one period from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends walk into this room , I want they should drop dead . " That 's another matter , outside of this concern for comfort .  | WE LIKE informal eating and drinking and having our friends in for help-yourself meals . We let our guests pass trays and help with the dishes , to make it easy all around to have people in , and we 're just as relaxed when we want to feed a crowd ? setting out trays and bowls and platters of food . We 're not averse to asking a guest to tend the chafing dish , or even to come over early to help get things ready . And our simpler entertaining , along with all the gadgets that substitute for human help , also makes it easier to have guests who look on invitations as a short holiday from making meals and cleaning up afterward . But we like also more formal eating and drinking , with a cluster of candles setting the silver and glass to sparkling , and everybody watching the host as he pours the first few drops of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the company . Somehow , coffee tastes better when poured from a silver pot by a lovely woman in a low-cut gown . Paper napkins are fine , even at a dinner party , but double damask is better . We like the pleasant contrast between a many-course dinner and a one-pot supper , between eating just with the family and having some friends in , between sitting at a table or on the floor in front of the fire . It 's when we 're uncomfortable that gatherings give us the willies . If we have to balance a plate and cup ? or perch on a hard dining-room chair , keeping our elbows tucked  | in ? most of us would just as soon stay home . We all dislike the dames who serve us dripping goo at a buffet and then expect us to eat it in their best chairs without spilling a drop . Still worse is the hostess who seats eight at a table for four , and then expects us to be gay . But we love the gal who provides food we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves those things we think we can manage , and sees to it that we have a place to set things down . Commenting on it all , my favorite aunt once observed : " Life would be much more fun if it were n't for its amusements . " We can blame our shrinking houses and efficiency flats for some of this . Wine , women and song are as wonderful as ever , candles cast the same old glow , and perfume , laughter and the rustle of skirts will never lose their magic . But nobody can say the same for the places where we eat . When the dining room began to disappear , all our reaction to change and c ar conservatism came boiling up . Maybe this was because there was so much social , political and economic change taking place all around us and we wanted a haven where we could vent our need for things-asthey-used-to-be . Like so many things about our houses , our dining habits may not have been liked or even noticed until they were threatened , and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . We went along with other changes brought about by shrinkage , but clung to the dining room ; and the resulting house was a tiny , efficient , glossy compact , with a large and inefficient chunk of it given over to mealtime ? a big hole in a small doughnut . Yet dining rooms have never been comfortable , particularly our traditional one which we inherited from England , where enjoyment of food was often considered vulgar and the goodness of a meal was measured by the time span of the postprandial stomach rumble . The English long ago began to give up their formal dining rooms , preferring to eat on a small table in the garden , or a drop leaf by the fire , or a refectory in a bay window . After- noon tea gave Englishmen all sorts of ideas for pleasant places to eat , and the dining room was reserved for occasional holiday and formal parties . The traditional dining room has a big table in the center and a chandelier dangling above it , with a big arm chair at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight chair pushed in at each side . On one wall is the sideboard , in another is a bay window , more straight chairs are ranked against the third wall , and the fourth boasts a wide doorway , preferably arched . As houses shrank , the doorway wall was removed and the dining room became an ell of the living room . Continuing to shrink , the dining room has become successively a dinette , a dining alcove and a dining nook . The table shrank , too , and it is now possible to play nosies across the squeaking board without even leaning forward much , while the tangle of limbs below leads to all sorts of odd talk and complication . Trouble began when the baronial hall was lopped down to fit into the early town houses built for the newly successful middleclass merchant . The idea was to enclose an activity within four walls , confining it there . This did n't even work when houses were big , for people refused to live in decorated and denominated file cabinets . We eat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out in the yard . A dining room was never able to take care of all our eating and rarely took care of even a fraction of it , for it was a place where company ate or where the family ate dinner . And a nuisance it was to carry in everything from the kitchen on the maid 's night out . We lunched and breakfasted in the kitchen , at first , until the pantry became lunch counter , drugstore booth or serving bar . The dining room was used more as a place for the kids to study ? or as a buffet for a party , or as a place to sort laundry , do sewing or wrap packages ? than as simply a room for eating . Planned for something for which it was rarely used , and not well planned at that , it was not satisfactory space for all the other uses to which it was put . And remov- ing the archway merely made its alternate messiness and emptiness the more noticeable from the rest of the room where people sat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we can dine that is also pleasant for other activities , and not think of it in terms of a specific room . Most of us want a table big enough to seat six easily . If it can not be big enough for platters and side dishes , we can make room for the serving of food on near-by counters and tables , thus returning to the original need for a sideboard . We need its function but not its bulk . Table service can be stored there , the storage being handy to the place where food is cooked and dishes are washed . The space must be a handsome place at mealtime , and between meals it should be an inviting spot in which to read a book , have a drink , watch a fire or do some work . All the surfaces should be easy to clean , so the work can be fairly messy : sanding a chair , sorting seeds , wiring a lamp , fixing a toy . If we paint one water color a month , rather than a dozen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the work should be the sort that does n't take too long , or can be picked up quickly , for it should be as easy to serve a meal there as it used to be in the old farm kitchens . What made the traditional dining room so useless was the placing of the table smack in the middle . A simple alternative is to put an end or the side of a table against the wall , making a peninsula rather than an island of its surface . This way there 's room for a big table which is pleasant for two or three and all the dishes they 'll need , yet seats still more when the table is pulled away from the wall . Here we can steal a trick from the poshiest restaurants and build a bench along the wall . The table can be pushed over it if we prefer to sit in chairs , but the built-in seating will take care of extra guests and provide a firm foundation for the youngsters , at the same time doing away with the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're up against what there is to look at if we put the end of the table against the wall . While eating , we like to  | look at our table companions , but we also like to catch glimpses of a view or a shadow , a painting or some flowers . And what we glance at should be far enough away that it 's not right on top of us and make for a closed-in feeling . People facing into the room will automatically have things to glance at , and those facing the wall will delight in a window to look through , preferably one with a wide sill so that the bounding plane is stepped away from the observer . If one end of a table is against the wall , a person seated at the other end is far enough away from it that what he glances at is not a problem . Here we can take note of a table built out from a projection of the wall , as a continuation of it , perhaps as a continuation of a shelf running along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will seat three in comfort , and if it is forty inches on a side , it will seat the trio luxuriously . If more are eating , a table the same size can be shoved against its end , just as is done in restaurants when a large party comes in . Another marvelous arrangement is a table built into an angled bay , which can be extended into an L-shape . With such arrangements there are usually several places for carving or serving tables right at hand . The trick of making all these pleasant to sit at seems to be to face one side into the room , with the other looking through glass doors or wide-silled windows to the out-of-doors , the table nearer an outside wall than an inside one . For leisurely eating , most of us need a lot of room . A restaurant table for four people , only thirty inches square , is possible because there 's a waiter to remove courses , and everything is served on the plates or from side tables . But at home we want more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go for more water or a second helping of peas . Two feet for each diner is about the minimum , and a table for six , with people sitting at either end , might measure three feet by seven feet . We can make out if the table is only thirty-two inches wide , but it 's even more pleasant if it 's forty inches across . A drop-leaf table seems like a good idea if there is n't room for a big table all the time , but most of them are too narrow in the  | stationary part , as are the leaves , so that diners are usually straddling legs . If the main section is a little wider than two feet , and the leaves are as wide , drop leafs work pretty well . The trick is to place them so that eating merely involves raising one leaf , although this arrangement usually puts diners quite close to a wall . It 's a nuisance to have to move the table around every time we eat . Tables with center leaves are also unhandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they warp peacefully between usings . One of the most pleasant places I know for eating is in a New York apartment , where people eat in the hall . The hallway is eight feet wide , though , and a round table with one leaf down is shoved against the wall where the corner of the hall opens into the living room . The table is five feet across , and one diner sits facing slightly toward the living room and its fireplace , while the other faces down the hall and looks at an enormous Italian chest eight feet high , covered with carved figures . There 's usually a bowl of flowers to look at , reflected in a mirror on the wall , and the other lights are turned off in the room when dinner is served , so that the space beyond the table is in partial shadow . For dinner parties the table is rolled into a room which serves as a study and extra bedroom , the leaves are raised , and seven or eight can be seated without too much crowding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and platters are put on a side table . This is makeshift , but it 's pleasant once the shift is made ; and because the table is round , there 's not much trouble with elbows . If the table were any smaller , though , diners would look as if they were in a huddle , crowding around the trough . Everybody goes to a restaurant for dinner if more than six have to be fed . I know a country house where there 's an eight-foot refectory table in a ten-by-thirteen dining room . One end wall has a fireplace and a doorway . The opposite wall has a wide window high in the wall . One long wall is lined with books , and the other has a low wide window and a door opening out on a terrace . At first  | the table was set in front of the books , but then you could n't get at the books . Instead of seeing them as a tapestry , you kept noticing the ones that had been pushed back on the shelves farther than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was put along the wall under the high window . It seemed to reach from wall to wall , too large in scale for the size of the room . In front of the window looking on the terrace . Nope ? cold draft on your back , and the light was bad . Finally the table was again put along the end wall with its high window and one end was shoved against the wall on the terrace side . The table was about three feet out from the end wall so that when you sat on its far side you could look out across the terrace or at the books , which now  | made a tapestry . People sitting on the near side could look through the high window into the trees , and anybody sitting at the head of the table could look out on to the terrace . Three could sit on a side , so that there was room for seven adults . And suddenly there was enough space in the room for a couple of wicker chairs , and a table could be set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for salad bowls and trays of coffee cups . In the corner by the bookcase was a small table with a lamp ? large enough for a percolator . A big lamp on the dining table filled the empty end toward the wall when only two or three were eating , and it could be set on the sill when five or six sat down . The table was turned the long way of the room when eight had to be served . During the day , somebody might pick a book from the shelves , plop down and begin reading . It was a nice place to have midmorning coffee , to sit while waiting for the oven to warm , to check on a recipe in a cookbook . It was a place to talk without disturbing someone napping in the living room or listening to the radio there , a place in this week-end house where you could get away from the other guests without fleeing out of doors or retiring to the bedroom . The room so used put something extra into the house ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dining room , but by putting one end of the table against the wall and building in a wall of books , the room became more than that . Here was a place for eating that was completely separate from the rest of the house . I know of another place for eating made by putting a long refectory table in an enormous bay at the end of a living room . The table had a piano finish ; the wood looked handsome in the light pouring in from the windows , inviting when set for a party , inconspicuous when people were having drinks in another part of the room , and festive when its lamps and candles were lighted and the window hangings were drawn behind it . It was pleasant during the day to sit there and eat a tray of lunch or to do some paper work . The table was a long  | way from the kitchen , though , so most meals were eaten there at a large picnic table . The cooking apparatus was in an ell of the kitchen , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows faced in two directions , and the place gave the feeling of a room made for sitting rather than simply one where cooking and eating was done . All such arrangements are designed for the ways we live , not simply for the doing of a single action . We seem to like places where we can eat with pleasure , rather than dining rooms as such . And what we like best is not a dining table , but several tables at which we can eat , all more or less handy to the kitchen and in different parts of the house . Because houses have become so small , we like those best which provide several places for any single action . We are dissatisfied when a room is made for just one thing , because we habitually do more than one thing at a time and we do various things in a series . We may want to do some desk work , eat lunch , read a book and take a nap , all in the space of a couple of hours ? and all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need different places to eat , as an example , because our living patterns change with the season , the time of day , and the company . Mealtimes are the only times some families get together ; so we need a big table for Sunday breakfast , over which we like to dawdle , and perhaps a smaller table for Monday morning , when the man of the house has to rush to work and the kids have to get to school . At breakfast we like sunlight , as long as it is n't shining in our eyes , so places where we eat breakfast should face east . We like the sun over morning coffee and at lunch , too , but during the summer we prefer the shade ; so an eastern or northern exposure is good for the lunch table , too . Sunset conies late in summer , and as we enjoy watching the sun go down during dinner , a northern aspect is pleasant . One table facing north and east takes care of most of this , but it may work out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be a good rule to be sure that all tables that are built in should be big enough to  | seat at least three diners , and to plan so that a movable table can be set with the built-in ones to increase the seating to six or eight . We need such tables in every space we make , but we should design them with eating in mind , as well as paper work and other things . We may build in a table primarily for holding a lamp or a vase of flowers , but if we want to sit at it comfortably , at least three of its sides need to be exposed enough to let us draw up a chair . And it must be either big enough to let us shove the bowl or lamp out of the way , or near enough to a counter or ledge that can serve as a resting place . Such tables get involved at once with architecture , for we do n't want them obstructing a passage . If they are going to be a continuation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet between the wall and the table for a chair . One of the disadvantages of an ell as a place to eat is that doorways may be on opposite sides of the space , openings perhaps centered in the two end walls . This is particularly unsatisfactory when the eating space is open to the living room at one end and to the kitchen at the other , making the space between seem like a hall . We object to this most when the spaces are small . As in all other spaces , the places seem more pleasant and tranquil if doors are concentrated in a single corner or wall . Contrarily , a passage is a particularly good place for eating if one side of it is made of windows or glass doors , the space expanded to make room for a table , with traffic concentrated on the inside . There 's something marvelous about an eating space that can be opened to the outside , especially when the opening goes around a corner . In warm weather such arrangements make you feel as if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space for more than one thing , we now have a reason for making it larger , or for making it an actual part of the living room . Instead of the usual way of making a living room as large as possible ? say twelve feet by twenty feet , with a dining alcove eight feet by ten feet , the first being narrow  | for its length and the second being perhaps too small for its use ? we might put all the space into one room fourteen feet by twenty-two feet or sixteen feet by twenty feet , or in two spaces ten feet by fourteen feet and twelve feet by fifteen feet , or ten feet by twelve feet and twelve feet by sixteen feet . But whatever we do depends on the cubic space we have to work with , on the furniture we 're already stuck with and on the placement of windows and other openings . The secret of comfort is to use all the space as much as possible or , to say it another way , to distribute our use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining uncomfortable , but still worse are the usual dining-room chairs . The seats are usually eighteen inches from the floor , so that anybody under six feet must perch on them . The seats are usually hard , rarely wide enough , and the backs are too straight . It 's more fun eating in chairs with arms , and there are handsome ones ? like the yacht chairs or iron ones for gardens ? that are less than two feet wide , yet seem roomy . Such chairs are better to have about than most of the straight ones because you can sit in them comfortably for longer periods . A table top is satisfactory for most activities when it is eleven or twelve inches above the seat of the chair . And if the seat of the chair is fifteen or sixteen inches from the floor , then the table top should be twenty-six to twenty-eight inches from the floor . Most dining tables are an inch or two higher , which means you have to cut some off their legs if you want to sit in comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dining use , handy when there 's a crowd . Table height has to be measured by the height of your chair seats , but perhaps the height for best adaptability is twenty-seven inches . This dimension is important , for it can become a vertical measure for cabinets , counters , ledges or tables , and may also effect sill heights . If you like to sprawl or happen to be short or skinny , a twenty-six-inch height is better ; but if you like to sit up straight , or if you are nearly six feet tall or heavy , tables might suit you better that are  | twenty-eight inches high . Practically everything in a house depends on the ways you like to sit and what you do while sitting . By forgetting the idea of a traditional dining room and concerning ourselves with the ways we eat and the ways we like to eat , our dining can take on new pleasures and be much more comfortable . Concerning ourselves with the making of a place for a specific use results in spaces much different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific use . We wind up with not one dining table but three or four , all of which can be used for a multitude of things . And we have made a normally large and limited part of our space into a much more pleasant place , integrating it into the whole pattern of our living . We have not only made this space more comfortable and better looking , but we have also improved the comfort and looks of the other spaces simply by spreading our actions more widely over the whole and making the spaces more flexible , more harmonious and more closely integrated . But more important than these are the facts that we have added variety and ease to the house . There are several pleasant places to eat . By using counters , side tables and serving tables , each place is less cluttered , and by using trays each one is almost as convenient as a table next to the stove . Because the tables are larger and there are extra places to put things , we now have room for the big platters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the top shelves when tables became too small to hold them . There 's room enough now for a twelve-inch dinner plate on the table , and a big salad bowl , and perhaps some flowers as well . Even spaghetti tastes better when you have room to swirl it in the sauce . By these changes we have added a new dimension to our houses ? that of luxury . It can be said that luxury is having what you need ? and perhaps a little more , just in case . This applies to elbow room , first of all . And by these changes we have added the greatest luxury ? the luxury of space .  | COOKING is one of the greatest spectator sports . Perhaps this is the key to comfort in making a place to cook . Men like to hang around the stove ? sampling , catching up on what 's happened during the day , watching while a woman bustles as everything gets ready all at once . Everybody likes to watch a man banging around as he fries an egg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would do credit to a haut chef in a four-star restaurant . Kids like to watch , help and eavesdrop . Everybody likes to cook or watch what 's cooking , lending a more or less helping hand or word now and then . Because nobody has much help these days , getting a meal and cleaning up after it should be a pleasant job for the whole family . The kitchen has been the heart of the house ever since there have been houses . In the old days the kitchen was the only place that was really warm , one reason why our ancestors ate there . Women spent most of their time there because cooking was a bigger job before the days of hot running water , refrigerators , and burners that turned on with a knob . These units are smaller and work better than they used to . Our neighborhood grocery makes it possible to store only ten pounds of potatoes instead of a bushel , with no danger of running out . We can buy things in small , neat packages . The canning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary cooking we need to do , and as a result the summer garden no longer has to be put up for winter  | eating . Smaller kitchens and neighborhood supplies of packaged foods have made cooking quicker , easier , pleasanter and better . But cooking , itself , has become no more efficient . It has become more accurate , but it is just as hard as ever to blend a good sauce or roast a chicken . The stove may be better , and the double boiler and the baster . The mechanics and techniques have improved . But you still have to get the salt from the shelf , water from the sink , an egg from the icebox , and the spoons , pots and potholders from wherever they are . You may forget something or need more of something . The art of cooking is as inefficient as any art , and a masterpiece is the result of care and fussing . People who love to cook usually know exactly where they want equipment and supplies , which varies according to what they like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all up thus : " I wish all the designers would forget about efficiency and just give me enough space . " A kitchen has to be big enough for two people to work in at the same time , even though most of the time one person may be doing two jobs at once ? say , cooking something on the stove and mixing a salad . There has to be room for the usually present spectator , out of the way but within sight and hearing of what 's going on , and near enough to lend a third hand when it 's needed . There has to be room to set things down and to pile things up . In kitchens , as everywhere else about the house , space is the greatest luxury . Space is more important to most cooks than the more dazzling creations of the designers , and an extra hand is more useful than a dozen gadgets . If they have enough room , and some help , and a group that likes good food , most men and women get a kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special . And all of us can work faster if we can turn around easily . It 's less tiring to take a step than to restrict our movements , trying to work in tight quarters . A diner grill , a dining-car kitchen and a ship 's galley are small in size , but they are usually planned so that you can swing your arms freely . They would be still better if they were bigger .  | Perhaps the best way to start figuring out about kitchens is to concern ourselves with what we do before and after we begin cooking , with those actions we perform when getting a meal that are not part of the cooking process . Most of this has to do with dishes . The dining table has to be set , so tableware should be stored near the dining table for convenience . Somebody may do this job for the cook , or it may be done by the cook while waiting for a pot to boil , but this chore should not interfere with the cooking process . When dirty dishes come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sink side nearest the table . That puts the washed dishes on the sink side farthest from the table . Yet , we want to store dishes as near the table as possible . That means dirty dishes should be set on the sink side farthest from the table . As someone is usually washing up while the table is being cleared , there must be room for the dish carriers to get by behind the dishwasher . This sounds confusing , but the result of it all is that the sink , rather than the stove or refrigerator , should be nearest the dining table , with counters on both sides of the sink for dishes . Dishwashing is the dirtiest kitchen job , and we should make it as simple as possible . The stove can be farther from the dining-room table because most pots go to the sink for draining and soaking before serving anyway . Nobody seems to care much whether dirty dishes are picked up from the left of the sink and clean ones put down on the right , or the other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While cooking , the cook wants to be able to set mixing dishes to soak , yet have a clear sink at the same time . To make cooking easier we need a double sink . The deep sink for washing and soaking should be toward the stove . The shallower sink for rinsing should be toward the dish storage and the dining table . And both should be big enough . They can be oval or rectangular , but each should be at least fifteen inches wide and eighteen inches long . One of them might be only six inches deep , but the other should be eight or ten , and some people prefer a pair of deep sinks . Most women are satisfied with a pair of sinks and  | are willing to forgo a dishwasher , provided the sinks are big enough . Women say they do n't like all the decisions they have to make about what to put in a dishwasher , and make the point that it 's not the dishwashing that 's a nuisance but the pots and pans that need scrubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dishwashing is a chore , not only because it 's a messy job but because it 's tiring . The sink is too low , and the washer has to stoop a little while washing ? much more uncomfortable than really bending down . Sinks have been too low ever since somebody first thought of a continuous counter , something which seemed like a good idea and looked nice but never worked too well . The standard counter height is thirty-six inches , but most people prefer a sink that 's at least two inches higher ; and a fortyinch height is even better . That 's why lots of women use a dishpan set on the counter for the actual washing job , using one sink for soaking and the second for rinsing . It 's not out of the question , of course , to build the sink counter higher than the other , particularly if the men of the house are called on to do the dishes . As with dishwashing , most people do n't care much whether the stove is to the right or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of importance when filling or emptying pans . Most people pick up a saucepan with their right hand , drain it , then shift so that they can spoon out the food with their right , too . But the cook can make a habit of moving in either direction . The standard thirty-six-inch height is fine for most . More important than direction is the need for heatproof space on both sides of the stove where pans can be set off the heat . A loose tile or two works fine for this . Four burners are enough for almost anything we are apt to cook ? especially when a percolator is used for coffee ? and there 's a hot plate or chafing-dish lamp around when extra heat is needed . Because a cook needs lots of room to operate , the burners should be in as compact an arrangement as possible , so that there 's plenty of space for the makings on both sides . Here 's an  | argument for small stoves . Most of them have ovens big enough for a turkey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roasting , a bigger stove is a waste of space . Most cooks dislike ovens that are below counter level , not so much because they dislike stooping but because it 's awkward to get heavy pans in and out . It 's also hard to see what 's cooking . There is no reason why the oven has to be underneath the burners . Bakers like to buy separate ovens so they can be set in at counter height , and many cooks crave two ovens . Most combinations are poorly made , and while the dials and finish may be fancy , insulation may be poor and ovens and burner frames may be full of cracks and seams that fill with grease . A restaurantsupply place can offer a wider range of burner and oven sizes in simpler and better designs than you 're likely to find in an appliance store . Sometimes such professional equipment costs more , but it 's money invested in cooking surface , not gadgets , designed for the jobs to be done , not for looks . And many people like their looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household stoves . The most inefficient piece of kitchen equipment is the refrigerator . Shelves of the box are too deep , so that anyone going for a can of beer has to pull out yesterday 's casserole , perhaps a baby bottle or two , an assorted collection of cans and jars , and several mysterious packages wrapped in wax paper . The cook has still more trouble when in a hurry for some butter , an egg , a little milk , a piece of the leftover roast and some vegetables ? all of which are tucked away in special containers or compartments . The refrigerator is really useful only for freezing ice and keeping frozen things frozen . Much better for the rest would be a cool root cellar opening off the kitchen , or a walk-in reefer , the restaurant cook 's name for a big refrigerator ; but the first is possible only if you 're building into the side of a hill , and the second is too expensive . One of the best arrangements I 've heard about is a homemade superstructure built over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the frame sat in the hole where the lid was supposed to go and consisted of a series of glass shelves for fruit , vegetables and other perishables . But until there are radical design changes , there 's nothing a cook can do about the inefficient refrigerator , unless you can find a freezer unit and a refrigerator engineer to install it for you . The cook at the stove needs to be in the middle of these appliances , within easy reach of the sink and the refrigerator . If they are strung out in a line , there 's likely to be a great deal of darting to and fro . If one or another of these three units is along an opposite wall , too much turning around is involved . Perhaps the most convenient layout is an L-shape , with the sink at one end , the icebox at the other , and the stove somewhere near the crook . Certainly the cook should be able to stand in front of the stove and be out of the way of any other kitchen traffic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else is going on . The cook must have room to work at any counter , and there must be room for a helper . With the stove in the elbow , a second person can pass behind the cook to work between the sink and icebox . Spectators and helpers usually congregate around the sink . They may be cleaning vegetables , or getting some more ice , or setting the table , or serving food , or washing dirty dishes as they come along . As the job of cooking is mostly waiting for things to happen , some cooks like the stove in the same counter with the sink so they do n't have to turn completely around while talking to somebody . This is a point , but the cook is usually doing something else while waiting for things to happen ? or maybe two things , or even three . The cook is more apt to sag limply across a counter beside the sink if there 's a pause . Even if the stove were at an angle to the sink , the cook would still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things get hectic at the last minute , it is perhaps just as well that the cook 's back is to the rest of the bustle , if only to make for better concentration . It is also useful to have the stove near a corner , for things can be shoved out of the way or passed on to a helper with less danger  | of spilling . But the nearest burner should be at least eighteen inches away from any corner , so that the cook will have elbow room . Because perishable things are kept in the reefer and are used in almost every dish that 's cooked , this cold storage must be particularly accessible to the stove and so placed that the cook does n't have to spin completely around to get what 's needed . The main problem is to arrange the space so that a cook can get at everything , be out of the way of whatever else is going on , yet still be in a position to keep an eye on everything . With all this in mind we come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reefer is across the passage from the sink and stove , but at a convenient angle to both . There is at least one good alternate layout , possible because we can give up the idea of a continuous counter if necessary . We do n't slide pots from the stove to the sink , but pick them up very carefully . Also , the reefer door is kept closed so that it can be placed to open into a doorway , if the doorway is rarely used . We might set the reefer in the corner between the legs for sink and stove ? a good practice because its contents are more frequently needed at both sink and stove than those from any other storage space . Such a layout , though , means that the cooking space will take up a square ten feet on a side . Thinking for a moment about hasty breakfasts ? and getting ice out for cocktails ? some people like to put the reefer nearest the eating and living spaces , then the sink , followed by the stove at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink in the middle , the cook passing in front of the sink to get at perishables . By putting the reefer across the passage opposite the sink , the cook can get at things without bothering anybody . The big point to keep in mind seems to be that the kitchen should be planned so that there is space enough near any of the main units for two people to work side by side or back to back , and small enough so that one person can work easily . Four feet between  | centers , or from the center of one unit to another , seems about right . The washer , drier and all other equipment should be out of the way of this cooking section . Beyond that , there 's no reason why the cooking section ca n't become an actual part of the adjoining spaces , or be set in a separate room that 's large enough to take care of many other activities . For hasty breakfasts a cabinet by the table ? containing the toaster , percolator , hot plate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save those extra minutes . For cocktails the glasses , bar equipment and bottles need to be accessible , even more so than the ice . Provision for their storage can be made right where we most like to do our drinking , or at least nearer that space than to the kitchen . No matter where we eat or drink , dishes go to the sink for washing ? a reason for having the sink as handy as possible . One of the biggest problems of cooking is the storage of many things close at hand ? a problem not very well solved by the usual metal kitchen cabinets with doors . Metal in a kitchen is noisy , and the less there is , the more pleasant it is to prepare meals . We use so many tools while cooking that a few drawers are a necessity ; but if there are too many , we have trouble locating what 's wanted . The best are shallow ones not over four inches deep , although the facing piece of the drawer may be larger in order to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the counter tops provide half a dozen storage places where needed most : two under the side of the sink toward the dining table for silverware , two on the other side for strainers , paring knives and such , and a third pair near the stove . These are all we need for cooking , in most cases , any more being turned over to string , skewers , and odds and ends . By keeping the main drawers free of things to be in use every day , and placing the drawers as near the sink as possible , we save rummaging and make afterwash putting away that much easier . To prevent confusion , many cooks keep one central drawer just for knives , another for kitchen spoons and a third for gadgets . But a better  | place for knives is a slit cut in the counter , into which blades are slipped . It 's customary to place cabinets below the drawers , but such storage is usually wasteful because it is too deep . If the doors of such cabinets are set back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for knees . This is a matter of comfort , for if our movements are not free , it makes for tension . If we constantly brush or bump against things , interrupting a movement , we are more likely to become distracted , hasty and confused . This minor yet incessant picking at our nerves actually becomes dangerous in a place where we are handling sharp tools or hot liquids . These cabinets with doors are good places to hide bulky and rarely used things we want to keep out of sight and harm 's way , and are more useful when not so deep because one thing does n't get behind another . A depth of eighteen inches is plenty for the biggest colanders and pots , but fifteen-inch shelves are even more accessible , particularly if it 's possible to build narrower counter tops . Even so , we still want to stop the doors three inches from the floor to make toe room , if possible curving up the floor covering to make an easily cleaned surface . This means setting the supporting studs and bracings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any doors should be fifteen inches wide , so that we can get at what we want by opening only one . Even more useful than below-counter shelves , though , are pullout bins under the sink for such bulky things as wastebaskets and trash cans , and for potatoes , onions , root vegetables and flour , usually kept under the counters between the sink and the stove . The wood forming the front can be peg-supported part way up the sides , its back fitted with various clamps , grooves or hooks to hold baskets , cans or boxes . They should be fitted so that they can be lifted out for cleaning . By making below-counter storage useful , there 's the chance for making above-counter storage more flexible and less cluttered . For a time , there , when everything in a kitchen was hidden  | behind cupboard doors , a kitchen was an oversize file room whose contents were familiar only to the cook and not always to her . Any offers of help had to be turned down because it was harder for the cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . This also discouraged anyone else from trying to whip up something for Sunday supper . By now , almost everybody realizes that a cook needs both open shelves and cupboards above the counters , not only for convenience but because many of the things used in a kitchen are nice to look at . About the only rule we can make about cupboards above the counters is that the top shelf should not be more than six feet above the floor or we 'll need a ladder . The cupboard itself can run up to a foot above that to take care of tall packages , but these might better be stored someplace else . And the best observation we can make is that cupboard shelves are too deep , for most packages are less than eight inches wide and rarely more than nine . Most cans and jars holding less than a quart or a pound , measure between three and four inches in diameter , so an eightinch shelf would take care of them , two deep . An exception is a pound coffee can , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not many others . If more than one thing is behind another , even if they 're all the same , it 's a nuisance locating them and taking them down from a shelf . The exception here is glasses , which are easily stored three deep . But plates and saucers are easier to get at if stored in single stacks or in racks , the heaviest and bulkiest on the bottom shelves . The result of these measurements is that we can steal a trick from our boyhood chemistry sets and some of the kitchen studies made at Cornell University , putting narrow shelves on the cupboard doors . The college will send you the plans . A single cabinet near the stove ? the main shelves eight inches deep for cans and bottles , the door shelves two and one half inches deep for spices and small things ? will take care of all our stoveside needs . Guard slats projecting out from door shelves make room for slightly larger cans , and keep them from toppling . Placing a sec- and cabinet near the reefer and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average kitchen , merely by making it more usable . The doors are opened when work begins , closed when over , and everything is at sight and at hand while cooking . The best cabinet width is twenty-four inches , with a pair of twelve-inch doors . A thirty-inch cabinet with fifteen-inch doors , though , holds much more because there is more unpartitioned space , but sticks out too far . Open cabinets in between can hold the bowls , pitchers , canisters and teapots that might just as well be exposed . If somebody insists on hiding everything , curtains are better than doors because they do n't stick out , or block other cabinets . Some of the handsomest I 've seen used to hide open shelves above and below the counter were made of bamboo screens which could be detached for washing . Many people like the looks of kitchenware , hanging egg beaters and such from hooks under the cupboards , and the pots and pans from hooks or rails near the stove . Some wives object to this because in-sight storage means too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black or stained bottoms being thought unsightly . For the same reason , many women like the cleaner cooking made possible with electric burners ? a point , if electricity is cheap in the neighborhood . Manufacturers have now made such burners so that they heat rapidly and can be switched quickly from a high heat to a low one , formerly the main objections to electric stoves . Perhaps the happiest solution is to use iron pots and skillets , which are the best for cooking and are supposed to be black , hiding unsightly utensils on hooks on the back of cupboard doors . This is more convenient storage than nesting them on shelves , the worst of which storage is built into the usual oversized stove . Nobody objects to open shelves if what 's on them ca n't be seen . Because they make the best kitchen storage , the trick is to turn them away from the line of sight . We 've noted that the best arrangement for cooking is an L-shape . If the kitchen is the same shape , part of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . We can also place the kitchen so that we look at it end on rather than head on . This way open shelves or the white of the porcelain cabinets are not so visible . Or the cooking part of the kitchen can go in a nook or ell . Cooks like counters in a cooking space because they do n't joggle . The standard twenty-four-inch width works out fine in most places and may be necessary , particularly if sinks and burners are set into the counter top . But this width keeps cooks out from the wall and makes it hard for them to reach shelves set above the counters . An eighteen-inch width is wide enough for most doings , and makes storage above and below more accessible and better in proportion . Probably the best counter top of all is laminated maple block , made like a butcher 's chopping block and almost impervious to wear . The maple comes in a variety of widths , lengths and thicknesses , the best thickness being a little over one inch and under two . It needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes on a fine color and texture with age and can be sanded down when badly burned or stained . Linoleum , cork or other sheet materials for counter tops can often be curved up to make a splashboard at the back . Some people make the counter a little narrower in such a case , topping the splashboard with a three-inch shelf running the length of the counter . Such a shelf is perfect for spices , spoons and the small odds and ends of cooking which are always getting mislaid ? those things which we 'd rather do without than look for but which make cooking better or easier . Because the counter around the sink must slope for drainage , perhaps the simplest way to build such counters is to slope the entire length toward the sink , say one-fourth inch for every two feet . A two-inch edging lath nailed and cemented to the front edge of the counter will stop the drips , and can be set level if the slight slant of the counter is apt to annoy anybody . Some people insist on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't what it used to be ? either in looks or chip- proof qualities ? and because it 's noisy , many people like to build the sinks directly into the wooden counter . A restaurant-supply house can furnish any number of sink sizes and shapes , made of stainless steel . Counters may not joggle , but there 's no such thing as comfort in a kitchen without a table . Counters are too high to sit at unless the cook perches on a stool , and even then she has to sit sidesaddle because there are usually cabinets underneath in the way of her knees . Everybody likes to flop down in a chair after a session over a stove or sink , and it 's nice to have the table there to hold an ash tray , a glass or a plate . Also , a table can be moved around to where it 's needed for more working surface , one end up against the counter . For easy shoving , the legs at one end of the table can be fitted with wheels or casters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a touch but can be moved easily when needed . A slab of maple block , with one-half- or three-quarter-inch pipe for legs , screwed into flanges fastened to the bottom of the maple block , makes a handsome table . A table thirty inches wide and four feet long is big enough for several people to work or sit at , and not so big that you ca n't maneuver around it . All sorts of substructures can be built under the table top , but such storage is hard to get at and gets in the way of knees . Some of the modern tea carts , particularly those made for outdoor use , are simple and sturdy enough to be helpful in the house , and can be stored out of the way so that they can be used as counters when not being trundled around . A table puts back into the kitchen a place to sit , something that practically disappeared from them when built-in counters became the rage ? a loss not well compensated for simply by making leg room under a section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table is between the cooking and eating space substituting for the usual wall or partition , where it can be used as a service table , buffet or extra eating place . Near the sink and the tableware storage , it can serve the uses to which we used to put the pantry .  | We have not as yet considered the relation of cooking space to the rest of the house or to other work space , mainly because we had to figure out what we had before we could figure out the place to put it . This is a sound approach to use whenever we make places , particularly those where we work and those which must serve the rest of the house . It seems like good sense to avoid making a passage out of the kitchen , to group the entrances so that there will be no through traffic . But we are n't apt to object if a doorway leads off into the furnace room or a storage room , for it 's not likely to be used frequently . The kitchen also needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very near one so that food can be served outside without the need for long treks . Also , the kitchen should be placed near the center of the house so that food can be served easily anywhere . If there are children that need watching , perhaps the space between counter and cupboard can be fitted with sliding panels , or windows through which the youngsters can see and be seen or food can be passed . It 's customary to put the sink under a window , the idea being that it 's pleasant to glance outside occasionally and necessary if there are children to watch . This is based on the belief that women spend all their time in the kitchen . Actually , an hour at breakfast , lunch and dinner , and an hour in the morning or afternoon to do the laundry ( providing the washer is there ) , is a lot of kitchentime for most housewives . Usually she 's in and out of the kitchen all morning and late in the afternoon , so the kitchen or the places near it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the outside walls often works well , the place it formerly occupied being used as a hallway , dining space and play place for the children , as well as a workroom , laundry or what have you . The cooking space could be lighted by clerestory windows over ledges , the ledges topping the cabinets and acting as storage space themselves . The room would be filled with light , and the high windows would cause a natural movement of air toward them , ventilating the whole house without the need for noisy fans . But even with clerestories , a fan might be needed at  | those rare times when cooking gets too pungent . A hood is handsome but wasteful of space , and a simpler arrangement is made by putting shallow cabinets above the stove , set out perhaps eight inches from the wall to form a sort of chimney , with a fan set in behind . This makes a good place to store crackers , cereals and potholders . Tube lights can be set in above the counters for still more lighting , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make seeing possible , yet still partly screen the kitchen . Going into such detail seems necessary , for making a pleasant place in which to cook involves providing the cook with plenty of elbow room without too much space between the sink , stove and icebox . Counters should be only eighteen inches wide wherever possible , not over twenty-four inches , and there should be a clear passage of at least four feet between them . A corner is a good place for the stove , because someone can work there undisturbed . The sink and dish storage should be nearest to the dining table . There should be space for a helper to work and use the sink and icebox without disturbing the cook , and there should be a table where spectators can sit and watch , where work can be done or meals eaten . What else might be done is not yet quite clear , because we have a confusion here ? a confusion between a cooking space and a kitchen . It seems necessary to make a distinction between a place to cook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to be used only for cooking , a simple and definite work space has been designed , a space measuring eight or ten feet on a side . Actually what has been designed is an Lshaped arrangement of handsome cupboards , counters and cabinets fronted by an L-shaped passage four feet wide , open at both ends . One arrangement provides for a doorway in the crook of the L. When thinking in terms of a floor plan , we can imagine this square with one corner cut off , placing it wherever seems most convenient . But when thinking in terms of space and function , we can best see it as an L-shaped arrangement . This is extremely important , because we must attach to this  | cooking space a variety of other spaces : a place to eat and its table ; a place for laundry , ironing and sewing , perhaps , including a washing machine , a sewing machine and a drier ( even though a drier often shrinks clothes unless in good condition and properly handled , and it might be easier to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dry ) ; a furnace room , perhaps combined with an indoor storage room , with space for hanging clothes ; a space for a carpentry shop or a darkroom ; a root cellar or pantry or greenhouse . It seems a good idea to keep the messier and noisier household activities together , planning each just as we are going to use it , and then grouping the spaces they make on the plan . Few of these need take outside wall space . They can be grouped together to make a central core of the house . But they need to be planned as carefully as the places we make for living , if only because we spend so much time working to keep a house running . The space for cooking serves the rest of the house and the ground around it . We need a table near or in it , and a place for the children to play . We might put one end of the space near a window or door leading to a terrace . The leg of the L containing the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving as a passway for dishes and food . The entire space might be set in a bay . Once we 've set the square of the cooking space on a plan , we can decide how to open it to the rest of the house and also open it to the other work spaces . Perhaps the first thing we should think of when laying out a kitchen is a large table , with its end against a wall ? this table related to the rest of the spaces , the cooking space related to it , and other work spaces related to the cooking space . At right angles to the table would be the handsome counter containing the sink , with a second counter containing the burners at right angles to that and facing the table . The icebox could be at the end of this counter , around the corner and out of sight but less than a dozen feet away . A door into the heater and storage room would be near the refrigerator .  | The hidden corner makes a good place for the laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , leaving the more accessible space clear for a darkroom or workshop . The table could be partly screened from the cooking space by open shelves for china and glassware . As only about six feet of space would be occupied by the sink counter , this could be set near the outside wall , with a window above , its wide sill acting as a serving counter to the outdoors . This arrangement combines the advantages of a cooking space in the core of a house , at the same time putting part of the kitchen on an outside wall . We do n't have to worry about enough storage space , because we 'll need less if it is better planned . But kitchens are a personal matter between the cook and the household gods . They should be handsome and comfortable , though , as well as practical . And that means plenty of room in the right places .  | NOTHING is more important to comfort than privacy . When we want to be alone a hard chair , a drafty corner or a cold rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is particularly so in a family , some member of which always seems to want to be talked to , played with or mollified . As well , there are times we do n't want to be completely alone ? a reason why doors in a house always seem to be open . Nobody used to the gregariousness of family life likes to feel shut off from what 's going on , banished to the kitchen or exiled to the worktable . We really want to feel completely cut off from the rest of the house in only those places where we sleep . Fundamentally , privacy involves getting away from it all , a good reason for placing sleeping quarters well away from the rest of the house . We like the sense of change involved in walking down a passage or up a flight of stairs . Rooms thus separated seem to us more remote than those which might open directly into main rooms . For the same reason , we like such rooms to face away from the others , the windows perhaps opening in a different direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar view . We need a feeling of privacy as well as actual privacy , a reason why we like to go around a corner or through a short passage when leaving one space for another . It is not so satisfactory to walk through a hole cut in a partition . Spaces need be only partly closed off from one another in the main parts  | of a house , but sleeping quarters should give the feeling of complete separation . Getting out of sight is fine , but to get out of mind as well involves being out of hearing . The sound of somebody falling out of bed , or coughing loudly , will carry through almost any wall . Sleeping quarters should be soundproof enough to muffle snoring , the dropping of a shoe , or soft laughter There 's nothing so inhibiting as carrying on an argument in undertones , and we should be able to complain loudly about the state of things without upsetting the children or giving the neighbors grounds for gossip . Such considerations are important in all parts of the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect our bedrooms to be as comfortable as those in a third-rate hotel , which means that a bedroom should be supplied with running water . We need a present-day version of the commode , a newfangled version of the pitcher , washbowl and chamber pot , not just so that we can get up faster in the morning to rush to work but because three stumbling steps in the middle of the night are easier than twenty . And we ought to have some sort of room service to supply us with orange juice and coffee in the morning , and perhaps some toast and marmalade and a coddled egg . This is a little more than is absolutely necessary , and it is true luxury . But it is perfectly possible if the children are old enough to get their own breakfasts ? and maybe ours , too . They love to do so , and it 's good for them to learn how . When planning our bedrooms we should keep in mind that we are apt to be wandering around without clothes on , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time , that we will lie there wakeful in the middle of the night , that we do most of our reading there and that we retire there during the day when things get too hectic elsewhere . We may spend only one or two of our waking hours there , but those hours are the ones that are likely to be the most fun. : The hours we sleep there do n't matter so much , just so we can sleep . The bedroom is the best place for a nap , but it is also a fine place to work because we can make it so private . It 's a good  | place to do paper work because the only people that are apt to spend any time there are those who sleep there , and so there 's no need to put the papers away in the middle of a job . Most of us prefer bedrooms that are actually one-room apartments , perfectly equipped for our intimate , private lives . A requirement for comfort should be that our houses permit each person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this line , we might think of a place for sleeping and nothing else , to see how big it must be and how big we 'd like to have it . A bachelor I know of found an apartment with a storage room that measured eight feet square , with a window and a door to the hall in one wall . He could almost reach across it . He painted the walls , ceiling and woodwork a warm , sandy gray , built a foot-wide ledge over the window and door , and hung some coarse yellow netting from it . On the floor he put some light-tan tufted cotton carpeting . In the far corner he laid a foam-rubber mattress , covering it with a rough blue homespun . He found a teakwood chest about a foot square , and a redlacquer coffee table two feet long . On the wall , in a post-cardsize frame , he put a sketch of a nude . On the mattress and the carpeting he tossed half a dozen pillows . Even his sister liked it , particularly the little pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleared out her storeroom , which had a door in the corner of one wall and a window in the center of another . But hers measured only seven feet square . She painted it a light yellow , hung some sage-green silk from floor to ceiling over the window wall , built a dark-wood shelf six inches wide and two feet off the floor along the door wall and put another tiny shelf on the wall opposite the door to hold a clay Chinese figurine . She used rose-colored carpeting , and set a couple of big brass trays on the floor to hold ash trays and odds and ends . She boxed in a link spring with dark boards six inches wide set on edge , covering the mattress with some dark-green Italian velvet . Too suggestive , she said , to put the mattress right on the floor . This Oriental way of sleeping or lounging right on the floor  | appeals to most of us because we like to sprawl , particularly in the privacy of the bedchamber , and perhaps because it is reminiscent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a blanket beside a campfire . Stripped down and made to come alive with color , a tiny space we can almost reach across becomes a magic retreat that seems more than big enough . With the bed close to the floor , all the space around it becomes a place to put things , a kind of enormous night table . Some of us are n't accustomed to the knee bending necessary to get in or out of such low beds , or do n't wish to become used to it or be so abandoned . Because of this , people have admired a raised alcove in one New York bedroom , with carpeting on its two broad steps and the mattress set in a frame of two-by-fours laid on the floor . A bed thus raised on a dais smacks of regal splendor and royal sanction , becoming acceptable to the most conservative and not necessarily connoting the trysting places of lusty queens . We save a great deal of space for living if a bed is shoved into a corner , where its size does not dominate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks best if we see it from the side , as we come into , or after we are in , the room . The bed so placed , we can sprawl across it during the daytime , using it as an oversized couch . Bolsters along the wall cut down its width and offer support to an elbow . Pillows zip-covered with handsome fabrics , over which pillowcases can be slipped at night , add to the feeling of luxurious ease . Some people like to cut down the width still more by shoving the bed under a ledge during the day , but most of us like the wideness because it makes for easier sprawling . A disadvantage of such an arrangement is that the one sleeping nearest the wall has to do some clambering to get in or out , making it unacceptable to some of those who need the exercise most . Another complaint is that such beds are hard to make . Bedmaking is overrated as a chore in these days of mitered sheets , warmer rooms and fewer blankets , particularly if the bedcovering simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or between the spring and bedframe . Some people put a handsome  | fitted cover over the mattress itself , spreading sheets and blankets for sleeping , and folding them up during the day , following the Oriental custom . Bedcoverings have improved a lot since the days of candlewick , and so have the beds themselves . Flat link springs do n't sag the way they used to or not so much , anyway ? and coil springs come in different degrees of bounciness . Soon , perhaps , some manufacturer will make a good , stiff coil spring that 's only four inches thick for those who like a firm bed . People are beginning to get wise to oversoft beds that seem to follow every movement , giving one the unpleasant feeling of drowning . Comfort is n't necessarily ultrasoftness , as innerspring-mattress manufacturers would have us believe . It 's hard to find the old hair-filled pads , but the alternative is not necessarily a bedboard between spring and mattress . Some people have begun to build bedframes around sheets of plywood , then setting a foam-rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . A support made of link springs , oldfashioned slats or interlaced webbing seems to work much better . Foam-rubber mattresses are still too expensive , but they last a long time and their edges keep their shape . Some people complain because they ca n't be washed and require a mattress cover ; but old-fashioned mattresses could n't be washed , either . A good sponging and airing once in a while does the trick for foam . Such improvements in beds and coverings make it possible to put the bed against a wall and to use it as a couch once it 's there . But if so used , it should be at least a foot off the floor , so you can sit comfortably on the edge . There 's also the need for making room for bedside paraphernalia . Shelves six inches wide on the walls will hold books , ash trays , paper handkerchiefs and glasses , without projecting far enough to be bumped into . A window sill or ledge a foot above the mattress serves as well . Right-handers like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's easier to reach across for things than to reach back on the same side . Most bedside tables are too high or too far back to be very  | useful , usually because they must support a lamp high enough above the bed to cast a proper light . Lamps work better when placed somewhere else ? fastened to the wall or the bed back , where they ca n't be toppled over . And the modern goosenecks work best of all because they can be twisted to shed light just where it 's needed . A bedside surface level with the mattress works out well , as does a surface not more than six inches above it . We like them movable so that we can pull them forward once we 're in bed . If such a surface were built to come as far forward along the bedside as we like , we 'd bump into it getting in or out . A drawer or pull-out or drop-down flap works fine . Beds without footboards shove neatly against the wall , so that bedrooms need no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The usual headboard looks out of place when shoved into a corner . Most of us are willing to do without these , too , in order to be able to put a bed in a corner , especially as these boards no longer fill any function . Often enough , though , there 's no corner for a bed ; and when only the side is against the wall , we need some kind of support to lean against . We need a solid backing for about six inches above the mattress against which to rest pillows , and something else another six inches up against which to rest our heads . A cabinet whose shelves or doors open away from the bed fills the bill . It 's top will support a lamp at the right height , and the cabinet supplies extra storage for bedding . This is pleasing , for we do n't like to come banging right into such a private place as a bedroom any more than we like to walk into a private house through an entry that opens directly into the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partition or open shelves could be run up to the ceiling , leaving just enough room on the bedside to make a narrow ledge . The partition could be little more than a screen , even bamboo or a curtain perhaps , or some opaque glass or paper . It might be a sheet of wallboard or plywood , sturdy enough to support a mirror or a picture . Such a bed back serves to make a separate place for a table and a chair , even if the division does  | not go up to the ceiling . Space behind our heads is not easy to reach when we 're sitting up , but it 's sensible to keep in mind that we use bedside shelves as places on which to keep things handy and safe during the night , not so much for use while we are awake . We can easily lay a book on such a counter as we turn over to go to sleep . It 's not much effort to reach over our shoulder for a handkerchief or cigarette , and we can set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates and glasses , though , we like a surface at the side as well . The space for sleeping need not measure more than five by seven feet for a double bed , which is usually fifty-four inches wide and seventy-five inches long . Three-quarter beds are four feet wide ; twins are three feet . An alcove should be eighteen inches longer and perhaps two feet wider than the bed itself . Usually we like to denominate a space for the bed that 's large enough to let us turn it to a new position every now and then ; so an alcove might best be seven or eight feet on a side . Twin beds can be set along a wall to make a long couch , or one can be shoved into a corner with the other projecting out from it to form an L , a narrow cabinet in between . Almost fourteen feet of wall space is needed in the first case , and in the second , a corner measuring at least seven feet in one leg and ten feet to twelve feet along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width . All this figuring leads to how we like to feel and what we like to look at when we 're in bed . Even though space is wasted , some of us like a wide bed placed with its head in the center of a long wall , the room opening out on either side . The side of the bed toward the inside walls might be denominated as space for dressing and primping , while the side toward the windows might be turned over to the man of the house and fitted with a table and some chairs . There may be only three feet between the opposite wall and the foot of the bed , which allows plenty of room for passage , especially if the door into the room is near the far wall , so that anyone entering need not have to make a detour around the bed in order to get to the windows . Lying in such a bed , we might like to look over our toes and  | through windows set in the opposite wall ; or we might prefer windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or both . In the far corner might be an entry into a small sitting room not more than six feet on a side , flooded with light during the day and perhaps big enough for only a couple of chairs . Or maybe that corner is perfect for a fireplace , one of the greatest bedroom luxuries . Its hearth can be raised so that it is easily visible from the bed , and the hearth can project into the room so that loafers can prop their feet up on it when they want to read in a chair . It should also be fitted with a screen , in case they fall asleep . The wall behind the bed might be stepped back to make a sort of alcove in the corner , and this might open out on a deck with a solid parapet so that it 's easy to see out but nobody can see in . Sightlines are particularly important in the bedroom . Windows faced to look into greenery or into spaces where there are no prying eyes can have low sills , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set four feet from the floor instead of two or three . A deck parapet can be much lower because it is at a distance from the room , sightlines being like those from a closer , higher sill . When a bed is set with its side against a long wall we sometimes get the feeling that the wall is going to topple down on us , a reason for stepping the wall back near the foot of the bed . This is the beginning of an ell , although we might prefer to put a nook or alcove in the corner across the room , so that the room seems to open up and expand at our feet . There 's not much difficulty in working out the living and sleeping places in a bedroom , but a place to dress and store our clothes is much harder . If we open windows at night , most of us prefer to dress in a warm bathroom . But even so , we need places to store clothes in or near the bedroom . Almost all such storage is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen drawers and at least three or four feet of hanging space for clothes , and a woman needs twice as much . Shoes , robes , old clothes to wear around the house , sweaters ,  | blouses and tee shirts all have to go somewhere , and usually get all mixed up with the dressier clothes we wear to work or to a party . It 's all very well to say to pack all the winter clothes away in the spring , but a rainy August day may call for a heavy sweater and thick shoes . A lot of this stuff can go into cupboards under the high windows , or into partitions between rooms , or in windowless outside walls . We all like the looks of a wall uncluttered with hinges and knobs , yet often enough the backs of closets facing into the other rooms will provide enough clear wall space . An excellent place for storage is in the hall . We like an entry into a room . By widening the hall and making some of that connecting passage part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closets . This space is not likely to be cluttered with furniture because it is a passage ; and because it is partly separated from the main part of the room , an early riser is less apt to disturb a slugabed . Such closets provide insulation where most needed ? between the bedroom and the rest of the house . Because this storage is less conspicuous than if it were actually in the room , it need not be so elaborate . The entry , too , is a good place for a washbasin built into a counter and perhaps backed with a mirror . Running the pipes and installing such a sink should not cost fifty dollars , excluding the cabinet ; and if it 's possible to get along with cold water only ? for washing face and hands , brushing teeth and getting a drink ? the cost might be cut in half . A toilet in a compartment is apt to cost twice as much . Perhaps the simplest storage would be an actual storeroom in the bedroom entry , six feet square and curtained off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side could hold suits , jackets and sweaters , with shelves underneath for haberdashery and linen , with a rack for shoes opposite and a high pole across the back for robes and dresses . This is the equivalent of more than a dozen feet of wall storage , without the need for expensive cabinetry or hardware or drawers . The partitions need not be par- ticularly sturdy . A sheet material nailed to the studding and left unfinished would do , cheap lumber sanded and painted serving excellently for shelving . Everything would be easy to get at , not so true in the average wall closet , where spaces beyond the door opening are generally out of reach . Lots of people worry about moths , so mirrored doors with shelves on the back would not only supply a stand-up dresser but make it possible to seal up the space for periodic demothing . Such elaboration wo n't help with the moths , though , for closet doors are left open or ajar at least half the time . Another important aspect of the room is the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody seems to like low ceilings in bedrooms , particularly sloping ones . They seem more intimate than high , flat ceilings , not only because the angles make pleasing shapes but because the planes remind us of tents , attics , garrets and other snug places . The ceiling can slant down to only four feet over the head of the bed , so close you can almost reach up and touch it while lying there , and yet the pitch ought to be steep enough so that we wo n't bang our heads getting in and out . Rain sounds wonderful drumming on a roof so close , and you may even be able to hear the hiss of falling snow if you listen hard . A room is also pleasing when the roof is high over our heads , sloping down to the eaves just over the windows . And if the eaves are wide enough , the windows can be left open during a windstorm or pelting rain . With the ceiling forming the underside of the roof , it is even possible to cut through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the branches toss , and the dawn come . These are the wonders of living , and we are closest to them , most conscious of the elements , when we are warm and safe in bed , without the distractions of workaday doings to keep us from being aware of them . Moments when we are only half awake are among the richest we know . The way light comes into the places where we sleep has much to do with our enjoyment of them . Some people say they hate  | sunlight coming in , but they usually mean they hate the bright glare of a morning sun on a light wall , or its glinting rays flashing in their eyes . Most of us like sunlight as well as shade , and a bright beam shining on a carpet , setting the motes to dancing in its bars , can be as welcome as morning coffee . Shadows of branches bobbing on a wall , or the reflection of water on a ceiling , add another dimension of wonder to the spaces in a room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it where we want it by considered placement of windows , breadth of eaves , and hangings in front of the glass . A room facing east can let the sun in if the bed faces away from the direction of the beams , its head against the north or east wall , its foot facing south or west . The bed might be in a nook or ell which lets in no direct light , while the other spaces are flooded with it . Even in rooms where there is no direct sun , we like to sit or lie with the light coming from the side or over our shoulders . Equally , we need to control the wind , and the heat or cold radiated from the walls and windows . Ledges help cut down drafts , as do low ceilings , and outswinging casements act as vanes to scoop the air in or turn it away . Hangings drawn across a window or hung on a wall build up a layer of still air high in insulating value . But all these considerations come after we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We may modify our plan to suit , in order to make the rooms still more comfortable . What we are after is not just a room for sleeping but a room that lets in the wonders of the outdoor world and makes a place where we can carry on our private lives . The room should be as large as possible , and it is worth the sacrifice of space in other bedrooms and even in the more communal or social parts of the house . We can make it seem larger and brighter with light paint , with fabrics and other materials , and by keeping it as uncluttered as possible . But we want to make it actually as large as we can . Perhaps the best way is to break up the partitions with projections , adding nooks and ells and making an  | L-shaped room . Certainly we want the feeling of two spaces joined together , rather than just a cubicle for sleeping . Most families want three bedrooms and would like to have one for every member of the family . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the kids double up and forgoing a guest room , with the idea of adding more space later . What we usually have in mind , though , is a master bedroom perhaps measuring twelve feet by fourteen feet , and two smaller ones ten feet by twelve feet , maybe with the hall made big enough to provide some extra space for a sitting room , study or occasional guest . But our minimum is usually about 400 square feet for bedrooms , and when we find out what this will cost a square foot we quickly forget any ideas about expanded halls . By lowering ceiling heights we might save a little cubage , but any of this we are apt to reserve for closets or use to avoid reducing bedroom size still more .  | From the first , we might better plan to make all but one of the bedrooms extremely small and very simple , these rooms to be used only for sleeping . Youngsters like rooms of their own ; but until they are six or so , they do n't mind doubling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunks . When they reach an age when there 's homework to do , a pull-down shelf or built-in counter in a corner could serve . A single room eight feet square is plenty of space for a couple of small-scale fry , especially if it opens into play space in a hall . Not until they are teen-agers will they need beds more than five feet long . A brace of rooms seven feet by nine feet will take care of two teen-agers , particularly if windows are in a corner or an end wall . Some of our best schools and suburban developments offer space scarcely larger , including closets . To be generous we might count on rooms eight feet by nine feet or seven feet by ten feet , providing we have to build only two at first , the children doubling up in one until they are both in school , and the second used as a study , playroom , guest room or what have you . We might put no bed in the second room , trundling one out of a closet when somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not total more than 150 square feet . This is not necessarily cruelty to guests and children . Rooms are scaled to adult dimensions , and youngsters prefer spaces that are cut to fit them ? beds not more than a foot off the floor , chairs and tables small in size . As for inside play space , they usually prefer to be where mother is , or completely alone where they ca n't be watched . It seems more important to give them a room of their own and the run of the house than to build special play areas they wo n't use much . Instead of closets seven feet high , a cupboard only three feet high is more useful for hanging clothes . Instead of a chest of drawers , open shelves and pull-out trays are more convenient . At first they want things to climb on , and later they want to build ; so the simplest , toughest , easiest-washed materials and finishes are best for the places where they sleep , build model planes and make drawings . If a  | youngster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with as little help as possible from the old man . A child needs a private place , and he does n't want to share it with anyone . Later a boy can build portholes and rope ladders , and a girl can make a dressing table and some dimity curtains . It may never look as nice as we parents would like it , but it will please the youngsters . As for guests , presumably they have come to see us ; and if we offer them a bed , a little privacy and good food and company , they wo n't object to being cramped for a few days . It 's better than a hotel . We can make a wonderful place with seventy-five square feet . One of the ways to do so is to make the space almost square , and another is to make it as narrow as possible so that we can increase its length , placing windows in one of the long walls . But the most useful thing we can do is to break up one of the long walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be only six feet wide , just enough for a door and a bed , opening to a wider space at the end . Or we might put the bed in a niche to get more space . We might build in the frame for a standardsized bed , but use only a five-foot mattress on it at first , building shelves over the rest . We can bring the ceiling well down over low windows and build in a low counter in front of them . The doors could open out into the passage , rather than into the room , so that built-in counters could be used more easily . When the door was open , the added space seen in the hall would seem to become part of the room . Also , we might try to place the door so that it opens into the larger space , and place the bed so that its side is to the larger space . Such rooms take on the feeling and looks of a ship 's cabin or a compartment on a train ? places that children delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we see many pleasant possibilities easily adaptable to the available floor space , with the backs of closets in other rooms forming the jogs . Such rooms look odd on a floor plan , but are wonderful to live in , their small size making them seem particularly private and intimate .  | Such rooms often seem bigger than much larger ones , and are more useful because the waste space usually taken by passageway or empty corners is put all together in one place . Having given over 150 square feet to the small bedrooms , we have 250 left for a large one . But if we apply much the same approach to a larger room , with more space for a bigger bed , and if we consider that two people are going to use it rather than one , we find that we can get along with less . Two hundred square feet is plenty . Windows can be wide and generous ; there is room for several chairs and a couple of tables , space for a fireplace and a goodsized sink . And rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are large enough as is , we might better use it to increase the storage space , or the size of the bathroom , or to widen the hall so that it can also be used for a bedroom or sitting room . For what we have stolen from the small bedrooms is space that is ordinarily wasted . The rooms are so planned that the despised corners become useful space . Bedroom luxury can be confusing . An oversized bed , for instance , sounds like the epitome of all that 's wonderful , but it 's a nuisance to make ; and the oversized bedding is hard to-handle and wash , expensive to launder . The ordinary double bed fiftyfour inches wide provides room enough for the most athletic ; and it is more friendly . On the other hand , a percolator and a teapot are fine things to have at our bedside ? for those midnight moments when we feel like a warm cup of something but ca n't face the cold trek to the kitchen . And it 's pleasant to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour a cup of coffee after we 've finished our shower . A hot plate for boiling water for tea or eggs , and a toaster , sets us up for a full breakfast . We can send one of the kids down for the morning paper . All this equipment can be stored on a shelf with a dropleaf front which is only a foot deep , a foot high and a couple of feet long . If we wish , we can cut a hole in the shelf in which to sink  | a square metal pan with a lid , big enough to hold an ice tray , a carton of milk and a pitcher of orange juice . A shelf above can hold the few supplies we need . It would be an arrangement similar to the living-room storage for glasses and liquor , which was discussed . We might not use such an arrangement much , and the second half of the loaf of bread might go stale ; but it 's usefulness on Sunday mornings or in times of sickness is remarkable . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ease slowly into the day , such provision gives us time to collect our wits . And it 's also useful for warming a bottle at night . Wherever else we may choose to skimp in a house , we should not leave the comfort and luxury out of our bedrooms . The private places we have been talking about are a long way from the usual cubicle outfitted with a bed , a bureau and whatever castoff furniture there is room for . Such bedrooms described here may take up less actual space than those we 're used to , but only because we have tried to cut out waste space . And one of them is much bigger than we are inclined to expect in a small and modest house . But because it is private space , it is even worth stealing cubage from the more public spaces in a house if we need to . We need a place to get away from things for a while . We love our children , but we heave a sigh of relief once they 're in bed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nice to go to bed early ourselves . We may do nothing more vital than read a detective story or write a long-delayed letter . But if the bed is comfortable and there are plenty of pillows , if the light is right and the room is pleasant , these are the day 's best moments . The only time some couples can steal to talk is when they 're in bed . And if the curtains rustle in a soft breeze , or the logs crackle in the fireplace , or the rain splatters on the roof , then we can stretch luxuriously , and happily become aware of the world around us . Life is wonderful , and nothing more to do until tomorrow . That 's comfort .  | THE usual bedroom with its bed sticking out into the room ? a chest of drawers on one side and a dressing table or small kneehole desk on the other , a straight chair here and a small upholstered chair there ? has always been inconvenient . It is a rectangular box too small for the furniture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it during the day . And earnest housewifely attempts to frillify it have only made it more unsatisfactory , as inadequate as a temperance lecturer at a meeting of the Barmen 's Association . We make each one as big as possible , rather than making most of them as small as we can and carefully designing them for their uses , making only one as large as possible . By trying to spread the luxury of space around we only waste it , ending up with no luxury at all for anyone . But even more inconvenient is the hall bedroom become bathroom , so ridiculous it has become the butt of most poor family jokes . All of us have waited , aching , for this tiny room to be vacant , bickering until some morning schedule is made , then bickering again if someone oversleeps or takes too long . At times a separate bathroom for every member of the family does n't seem to be enough ; and when there are fewer they are rarely designed to handle more than one person at a time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an irresistible urge to buy a new house every few years . She is finan- cially prostrate today , as she has been since Edwardian times , because she has always had to pay outrageous rents for small apartments with two baths . But she is worshiped by many because of her crusade to get in some more plumbing . She is n't happy until every bedroom has its own , and maybe an extra one here and there just in case . She is a minor authority on toilet bowls , and claims she has yet to find one that works right without making an unearthly noise , or one that does n't start working all by itself in the middle of the night . But in the past three decades she has discovered the answer to the dripping faucet : you put a washcloth under the tap . She claims that there is absolutely nothing that anybody can do about rust stains , except to admire the handsome color , and that the only plumbing improvement of the twentieth century has been the mixing faucet . Everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of man 's defeat by the scientific contrivances he has devised , even surpassing in bad design the streamlined but stationary refrigerator , the dazzling and therefore deadly motorcar and the chromium pop-up toaster that slowly coats itself with crumbs . The bathroom marks the triumph of ideas over common sense , the blind supremacy of mind over animal nature , the trembling acme of discomfort , the epitome of the inane . In its way the bathroom is a marvel of its kind , the antithesis of ease and luxury and yet a symbol of both . The most uncomfortable part of any house , it should be the most comfortable . We use a bathrom when only partly dressed , or not dressed at all : mostly in the morning , when we are sleepy and even groggy , and in the evening , when we are tired and usually in a hurry to get to bed . We are most vulnerable , then , to accidents . Without clothes we are most aware of discomfort . Yet everything in the bathroom ? the walls , floors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than warm . Tile floors and walls are unpleasant to the touch ; they are slithery when wet , and hard when slipped on . The sinks and bathtubs are covered with a thin layer of easily chipped porcelain , slippery  | as ice when wet , often as cold . Spaces are so cramped one is forever bumping into the unyielding surfaces , with a resulting flinching reflex that is not only unnerving but is apt to throw us off balance . Surfaces show the slightest smudge or stain , and yet because everything is gleaming white , transparent slicks of water or soap are invisible . There is nothing like a bathroom for being uncomfortable , and it is the most dangerous place in the house . The three bathroom fixtures were placed together originally , not so much because they were habitually used in conjunction but because water and waste lines had to be run into already existing structures . And there seemed no point in tearing up two places if you could get by with tearing up only one . As well , the first bathrooms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapest way seemed best . Today 's bathrooms still cost too much , are just as hard to put in , and the easiest and cheapest way still seems best , sacrificing any comfort or luxury in order to add another foot to the living room . The hall bedroom became the bathroom in Victoria 's day , and though it has moved around some since and shrunk a little , you can still see the bitch in the pup . Even the Edwardians realized , though , that one bathroom would n't do for a big house , and the new houses they built sometimes had two or three . To save running upstairs , the powder room came into being ? that delicate hallway euphemism that embarrassed living-room eavesdroppers and mortified the powdered . In the shrunken houses of the Thirties the trend was back to a single bathroom again , and the whirlpool type of toilet was developed , which swirled unctiously for a few moments before stopping action with a final loud gluck . Through all this it is interesting to note that the bathroom was named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic GI 's returned to brand the lavatory with a shorter euphemism ? the john . The custom of adding an extra john whenever possible has continued , unconsidered and unchecked , with the exception of discreetly disguised basins and toilet compartments in the more  | lavish of our structures . To relieve strain , some of our brighter geniuses have planned for two washbasins in what has come to be called the family bathroom , tacitly insisting that thorough washing of the hands is what one wants to do most anxiously upon arising . There 's no doubt that sink activities take up most of the time we spend in the bathroom ; but instead of supplying basins in other rooms so that the tub and the toilet would be free , they compounded confusion by making still another fixture unavailable in times of need . All was done for the sake of efficiency or cleanliness and not with any idea of comfort or pleasure . Laving tired eyes , soaking tense muscles or loosing bloated bladders and bowels ? all have come to be thought of as immoral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an indication of weakness , softness , vulgarity , vile or , at the least , bad manners . When we wake in the morning we first want to relieve ourselves , and as most families wake up about the same time , at least one toilet installation should be made where its use wo n't conflict with other cleaning up . A separate compartment in the hall , preferably near the master bedroom , serves well enough for most families of three or four members . This need not be reminiscent of the stinking pits found at the ends of day coaches or in hotel corridors . It need not be decorated with a mural or a built-in paper roll to be comfortable , and we seem to like its looks best if the cabinet is plainly functional . The walls can be painted in a warm but washable color , or covered with a fabric or paper that will make the surfaces feel warm to the touch . The floor can be covered with washable carpeting . We need pleasant light to read by , perhaps a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that someone outside can not see in . Usually , though , we 'd rather not give up outside wall space to such a cabinet , and the room might be lighted and aired through a skylight . If even this is impractical , the space needs to be fitted with a small rubber fan like those installed in telephone booths , so that  | it automatically flicks on when the door is closed . A door like that of a telephone booth would be practical , so that one would not be banged by someone trying to get in . Such a door could be made with a couple of wide boards or panels , with light and fan triggers fixed into the jam , the door held closed by a simple hook and eye . A washbasin set in a counter would add to the compartment 's usefulness , duplicating the function of a train toilet but not its unpleasing aspects . The compartment could be four feet long and only thirty inches wide , although a three-foot width is less apt to bring on attacks of claustrophobia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that time she spends in front of the mirror above the washbasin . Getting pretty may be much simpler than it used to be , but it takes just as long . At least part of this activity , too , might be removed from the bathroom . A washbasin seems to be inextricably involved , and as our ladies might as well be comfortable while making themselves ravishing or unravaged , such a basin might be set in the counter of a dressing table right in the bedroom . There is never enough space around the ordinary basin for all the gadgets to do with shaving , let alone with the feminine process of making up . What space there is , is usually so arranged that things fall into the water or to the floor . A foot of counter , more or less , on either side answers the purpose and serves to make the sink less conspicuous . The tendency is to make such bowls unhandily small , and an oval or round one should be big enough for washing a pair of stockings or bathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in mind that for the first six months a baby needs nocturnal attention , so that this part of the bedroom should be large enough to hold a crib , being useful later as a dressing space . With such uses in mind , the basin might best be placed at the end of a projecting counter rather than in the middle , so that two people could hover over the bowl , or so that one could be using it while the other is studying beard or complexion in the mirror . By making such bedroom arrangements we not only decen- tralize use but also divide up the usual bathroom clutter of cosmetics , medicines and other preparations jumbled together on the shelves of the common medicine closet . The door of such a chest might be fitted with narrow shelves , made much the way of a kitchen cabinet . Pull-out or swing-out drawers or trays under the counter will handle more of this . But most useful of all is a series of small open boxes strung on a pole or built in a corner , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other small things can be tossed , partially out of sight , yet quickly at hand . At first , one might suppose that such a counter should be built at a height convenient to sit at , but this would make the sink too low . Also , women seem to do most of their primping while standing , either through choice or habit , and it is mostly in movies or backstage dressing rooms where one sees make-up being applied sitting down . Women seem to like a large mirror to than average table height ? and perhaps only fifteen inches wide ? might prove ideal . Women seem to prefer artificial light for making up , and a row of lowwatt bulbs around a mirror , like those in a star 's dressing room , or fluorescent tubes at the sides would provide an added professional atmosphere and be handy for shaving , too . This sounds like a pretty elaborate installation , but it need n't be . Certainly any sinks placed in other bedrooms could be much simpler installations . A counter around the bowl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink , and is more adaptable . All this requires a much more complex plumbing system than should be necessary . It should be a simple matter of attaching flexible tubing to the water lines and snaking them to where they are needed , using a slightly larger tubing for the waste line . It would be still simpler to use a good grade of hosing for lines , but even this is expensive and often illegal . In any event , all lines should be laid in easily get-at-able trenches , so that floors , partitions and studding do not have to be ripped up  | for repairs . To save costs , plumbing fixtures can be put as close together as possible ; but using this as a basis for planning is unwise because we very often complicate the placement of rooms , wasting cubic space in order to save the cost of a few extra feet of pipe . Plumbing fixtures and lines should go in where they will be most useful to the spaces they are to serve . With such installations , one bathroom is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can truly become a space for bathing , even if we also include the other fixtures for added convenience . Again , we might widen and lengthen the entrance into the bathroom , making space there for a toilet compartment and basin so that the room itself is reserved for bathing . Family members could still use the facilities together , without offending personal dignities . Like so many other things , they do n't make tubs the way they used to , and if they did , most of us could n't afford them . In the good old days the porcelain was so thick and strong it actually had a texture , warm and pleasing to the touch . Tubs were big enough to swim in , almost , and were at least long enough to stretch out in . Handles on the faucets were large enough to turn with the soapiest of fingers , and the water tumbled into the tub through a great spout . Some of the tubs were beautifully made , as were many of the old marble washbowls . You can still find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be torn down , perhaps stained with the years but still unchipped and unscratched . Perhaps some manufacturer will make them again , or some surface can be developed that will not feel cold and slippery even when dry , nor be treacherous when wet . The best installations I 've seen were tailor-made and fabulously expensive . One was a ledge of bluestone , beyond which was a great square basin made of rough slabs and carefully cemented together . Another was made with rough-surfaced nonslip swimming-pool tile , a tub almost seven feet long and half as wide , free from the walls on all sides . The tiles were laid over a reinforced concrete frame . The water fell into a basin at  | one end , cascading down over a step and into the pool . The whole floor of the bathroom drained into the pool , and a pair of shower heads rained down like spotlights into the tub . Duckboards covered the floor , and with the door shut , the room became a steam room , which could be hosed down for cleaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford such magnificence , unless we know a philanthropic mason whose brother is a plumber . As a substitute , the best we can do is to select a tub from a manufacturer 's line , choosing one that has a back that slopes properly , has a wide edge so that it can be sat on , a smooth bottom and a finish that is as slipproof and chipproof as possible . Sooner or later somebody will make a proper lightweight tub of plastic or sheet metal , stamping it out the way they do auto fenders . These may dent a little , or scratch , but they wo n't be slippery , or chip . Until then , the best we can do is fit a duckboard or rubber mat into the tub . To warm things up , about the best thing we can do is to turn on the hot shower for a few moments . A big help is infrared and ultraviolet lighting , bulbs mounted behind wooden grids to cut down their glare , set in the ceiling or high in the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin but also helps keep things from getting damp or mildewed . They should be placed so that you do not habitually look toward them , set so that they are over your shoulder when you are in the tub or when you are dressing again . An ultraviolet bulb might be trained on the floor space beside the tub , so that you could lie there for a sun bath . Any other lighting fixtures should be covered , and we might use outdoor sockets to prevent any corrosion . Heating units or other appliances that require extension cords are out of place in a bathroom , where wet hands might touch them , or dampness might cause a short circuit , or a dangling cord might fall into a puddle of water . Materials rough to the touch are warmer than the smoother , harder materials usually used in bathrooms , and one of the most pleasing is cork . Some of the composition materials or water- proof plywood are also pleasant , rarely more expensive than the usual tile or plaster and much easier to maintain . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gleaming whiteness of the fixtures lose their sterile , antiseptic look . Most bathroom fixtures are manufactured in colors now , but the colors are usually hideous . A bath lends itself to being placed in a room by itself , because it is normally put in a niche anyway . This is a good place for one , but few tubs provide spaces wide enough to hold the paraphernalia of comfortable bathing ? soap , brushes , sponges . A wooden tray for these is more useful than an assortment of dishes , racks and hooks . But even better is a ledge built all around the tub . By making the niche a foot larger than the tub , sheet material used for the walls can be curved down and out to cover a built-up frame , the tub edge being cemented to that . The ledge makes a place to lay down your book while you dry your hands , or for an ash tray , or for the glass of hot toddy  | when you 're sweating out a cold . It is expensive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step could be built along the side of the tub and covered by the floor material ? a big help when you are bathing a baby or scrubbing away the ring . A step also cuts down the danger of slipping , and makes a place to sit while you 're drying your feet . All such additions make a difference when we 're soaking and discover suddenly that the soap is on the other side of the room . Making a place just for bathing puts the luxury back into that ancient rite . Because the other fixtures can be used without bothering the bather , the feeling of haste that usually goes with the bath is done away with , for other members of the household are not so apt to be forced to ask you to hurry up , it being fairly simple for families to arrange convenient times for bathing that do n't conflict . The urgent demands of nature are what cause all the trouble . For really comfortable bathing , most people like to have a bench or stool around , something on which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all vain , a full-length mirror on the back of the door permits admiring inspection of the small of the back . A narrow shelf for jars , nail scissors and combs also serves as a place to put your watch before you hop in . Below could be some foot-wide shelves for towels , washcloths , extra soap and cleansers . Much design attention has lately been lavished on storage for bathroom linen , with enough space allowed to take care of a supply for a girls ' school ; yet a stack of towels takes up little room , even if they 're all different , and they could be piled at the end of the ledge . Hanging space for wet towels or for those in use is something else again . In an ordinary bathroom , half a dozen towels may be on the go at once . A railing along one whole wall is not too little hanging space . Even better night be a double row of wooden pegs on which the towels can be tossed , with extra pegs for hanging up robes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless they are draped precisely  | and straightened often , yet look all right when tossed over a peg . Men like a shower , women like a tub , and so for frequent bathing and to keep both sexes happy , designers urge on us the separate stall shower . Most stalls are too small for comfort , but a big one might go in a second bathroom instead of a tub . If we are going to be stuck with only one bathroom , though , a shower above the tub works fine . More useful would be a second washbasin or toilet cabinet . Most people spend less than ten minutes in a shower , long enough to warm the room up nicely for somebody 's leisurely bath . In the small houses most of us can afford , putting the bath by an outside wall is a waste of precious space . Windows are n't apt to be opened often , the glass usually needs to be frosted anyway , and on chilly days the pane feels unpleasantly cold . The idea of a window near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good one ; and while it is possible to plan a window or face it so that we can see out but not in , we are not likely to glance through it much . A skylight might be more practical , or clerestory windows . On ledges in front of them can be placed the lights and things you like to look at . With such openings , or with artificial light , the bath can be placed in the center of the house and free of the outside walls , following the practice of our best hotels . Inside walls are not only warmer , but if the bath has clerestory windows , they will cause a flow of air to them , ventilating the surrounding spaces . The bathroom is a good place for any gym equipment that may be felt necessary , and it is also the place for that object so dearly loved by all returning tourists ? the bidet . This French gadget for feminine health and happiness has done as much to build good will as have French wines and cooking , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her arm . Probably no cleansing device invented serves so many uses , perfect for washing feet or rinsing diapers , for light laundry and overnight soaking . To many of the fair sex they are the epitome of civilization , sanitation , practicality and lux- ury , all in one . The cheapest of French hotels furnishes a washbasin and a bidet , even in their poorer rooms , and this combination is so successful and satisfactory it might be a good idea to consider making a compartment of this plumbing duo . The bath , though , is as good as place for the bidet as any . One of the keys to comfort is being able to use what we 've got without worry or effort , and by compartmenting the various fixtures found in the ordinary bathroom we can make them more accessible . The simple business of putting the toilet into a cabinet of its own , perhaps with a second sink , is about the equivalent of adding another complete bathroom , in terms of increased usefulness . By putting sinks in the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting the tub in a separate place of its own we add still more luxury , and use at the most only an additional six square feet of floor space . And we actually save space by placing toilet and washbasins in compartments in the hall . By moving these fixtures away from outside walls we not only make them warmer , less drafty and more comfortable , but we add more outside spaces to the other rooms in a house , adding to their looks and livability . But what is still more important , with any one ? or several ? of these changes , we have simplified the often hectic business of getting up in the morning and going to bed at night , two activities that are the cause of much family ill-feeling when there is n't enough plumbing to go around . By such changes we not only add comfort to a house but we put the occupants in a better frame of mind to enjoy it . And this is the basic idea behind any planning that we do or changes we may make . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some of the great treasures passed down to us are the storage pieces past generations have made : tables , chests , boxes , cabinets , cupboards , trays , bowls , bags . There has been an unceasing flood of beautiful containers , on which has been lavished the genius of every age , the best of skill and decoration , art and craftsmanship . Many of the old pieces do n't fit our needs today , for the things we put down or put away are usually lighter and less bulky than their earlier equivalents , and there are more of them . But because so many of the old pieces are beautiful , we like to have them around . They may be inconvenient and require too much dusting and polishing , but their looks more than outweigh their nuisance value . We make equally handsome and more efficient pieces today , because we have better tools . But few of us are apt to throw out a Florentine chest or a Queen Anne table , or even the often superb reproductions of them , merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nice we have both the inherited and the in- heritable , and both need houseroom . However , the mere presence of many storage places does not automatically solve the problems of where to put things . Once a house has been planned to suit its location and what we do in it , we have to make a place to put the things we have to put things in . A wall may have to be longer , or a niche deeper , or a ceiling higher , to accommodate the corner cupboard , the highboy and the kneehole desk . Very often , old pieces serve their function as well as modern versions or ones we can build , and as only decorators say you ca n't mix periods ? an idea which even they are giving up ? there is no reason why pieces from another age can not serve us . We need only fuss about odd differences in scale or extremes of decoration , variations which a house designed to fit our needs will take in its stride . And none of us is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Colonial pine table in another . We are more apt to like the contrast . All this is a small matter to most of us , because few of us are likely to have more than one or two fine pieces ; and still fewer have the time or wealth to search out more good ones from the mass of junk and claptrap , old or contemporary , found in most of our antique and furniture stores . We feel lucky if we find a decent chair after a six-month search . We find it more satisfactory to build in most of our storage spaces . Ever since the shrunken house became a fact rather than an evolving condition , the problem of storing has had an awful lot of attention . It has even been considered on the grounds of morality , and the dictum of a place for everything and everything in it has been raised to the level of philosophy . Many houses have become filing systems as a result , often as much as ten per cent of the space given over to storage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only a cabinetmaker could hope to construct it properly . It should all be much simpler than that , and much cheaper . ? What most of us are more than willing to settle for are places to put things be- tween usings . Some of these we want to get at as often as several times a day , while other things may not be needed for months . Some have to be out of sight , either because we do n't want to look at them or because we want to keep them safe . And we want places where we can put things without having to think too much about it , and where we can find them again in a hurry . We need also a place for things we should throw away but do n't . Grandmother used to say , After seven years you put it in a box , after seven more you turn it over , and after seven more you put it in the attic . Today we throw it away because we have n't got an attic . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting rid of everything every seven years , then starting all over again from scratch . Most of us prefer an attic . But today 's cost of providing the space might be more than the value of things put in it . There was always the garage , but today that 's gone , largely because a modern car does n't need such presently expensive protection . A shade tree in summer and the covered terrace in winter works out fine for most cars ? so well , in fact , that many apartment builders have taken the hint and omitted garage facilities altogether , substituting parking lots . The really fastidious motorist might build a lean-to of two-by-fours , roofed with a tarpaulin . Such an arrangement would work equally well for many of those things we want to stow in an attic . Best of all , probably , would be a shed . But storage of tools and junk is not a first consideration when considering places to put things . We want storage to take up as little space as possible , to leave more room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from outside walls , to leave more room for openings to the outside . Ledges and counters will take care of most of the things we like to look at , as well as those things we use frequently and do n't mind looking at . Cabinets below windows provide more space without blocking views , and add their insulating values to the wall . Some people like the idea of making a shallow shelf only two or three inches high between the cabinet and counter , a
