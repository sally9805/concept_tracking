After 20 months of hiding , the slight , balding clothing salesman made a mistake . He dickered with a Miami Beach car dealer and got a good trade-in on his battered ' 54 Oldsmobile . The auto dealer made a routine title check with Brookline , Mass. , where the car had been bought . When the clothing salesman picked up his new Chevrolet , a Massachusetts state police lieutenant and a Miami cop arrested him . The charge : kidnaping . <P> Behind the charge against Melvin Bentley Ellis , 45 , and his wife Frances , 37 , looms a bitterly felt religious conflict : the Ellises are Jewish and Hildy McCoy , the freckled , honey-blonde first-grader they adopted as a ten-day-old baby six years ago , was born of an unmarried Roman Catholic mother . <P> Miami 's Peace Justice Malvin Englander last week rejected a Massachusetts demand for $5,000 bail , released the Ellises in the custody of their attorney , pending an extradition fight . To reporters , meanwhile , the Ellises told the story of their struggle for Hildy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Ellises took the first legal steps to adopt the baby privately ( i.e. , not through an adoption agency ) , Hildy 's mother , Marjorie McCoy , then a nursing trainee , demanded that Hildy be taken from the Ellises and put in a Catholic institution for adoption by a Catholic family . She claimed she did not know until after she signed the adoption papers that the Ellises are Jewish ( they say she knew ) . At no time did she say that she wanted to keep Hildy herself . <P> In September 1953 Probate Court Judge James F. Reynolds of Norfolk County ordered Hildy returned to Marjorie McCoy , on the basis of a Massachusetts law ( several other states have similar statutes ) which says that " when practicable , " adopting parents should be of the sarne religion as the natural mother . An appeal to the Massachusetts Supreme Court was denied in February 1955 . That June Hildy 's mother appeared with two social workers at the Ellises ' Brookline home and demanded the child . " Hildy was terrified , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Wo n't it bother you that she will cry for me and for her daddy tonight if you take her ? ' " <P> The Ellises would not give Hildy up , but offered to rear her as a Catholic if they could keep her . They were turned down . In all , they made 22 appeals to the State Supreme Court , lost all of them . <P> Free to Choose ? On June 15 , 1955 Judge Reynolds gave the Ellises 48 hours to surrender Hildy . Frances Ellis took Hildy and went to Tuckahoe , N.Y. , the first of several stops on an underground railroad manned by friends and relatives . Her husband followed . Together they moved to Levittown , Pa. ( then left after Hildy was mentioned in a newspaper as a birthday-party guest ) , White Plains , N.Y. , New York City , Thompsonville , Conn. , Scarsdale , N.Y. , and Portland , Me . <P> They arrived in Miami last May , determined to stay there and try to adopt Hildy under Florida law . Ellis , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job spotting clothes for a dry-cleaning firm , then found a better one covering Florida for two clothing firms . They entered Hildy in a private school , made no attempts to hide their identity . Of Hildy , Ellis says :
