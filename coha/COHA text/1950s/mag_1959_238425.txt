The Boss <P> Sir : <P> Jimmy Hoffa says if the labor bill passes , he will advertise the ones who voted for it . Let 's hope he does . That will separate the men from the boys , the ones with guts and the ones too white-livered to face Hoffa and his racketeers . This will be good information to have next election time . <P> <P> MRS . FERN JAQUAY <P> Hot Springs , Ark . <P> <P> Sir : <P> If Senator John Kennedy , with all the power vested in him , can not stop the hoodlumism in the arrogant Hoffa 's Teamsters Union , then he should not even be considered for any higher office . <P> J. P. LORSCHEIDER Fort Lauderdale , Fla . <P> Sir : <P> Thank God for Jack Kennedy , who has the intestinal fortitude to put honor and his country 's good above his job . ( And I am a Republican . ) And thank God for Ike , who also knows the meaning of honor and who also has the courage to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the President and Congress-not labor bosses and union gangsters-run this country . <P> <P> NELL E. VON DER HELLEN Eagle Pdint , Ore . <P> The Kangaroo Habit <P> Sir : <P> Thanks to you and CBS for presenting Captain Kangaroo Aug. 3 . It is the only " children 's " show my children will watch . The local shows for wee ones present old cartoons and adult commercials , and my children walk away . I would appreciate seeing Mr. Keeshan sans Captain costume . <P> <P> MRS . THOMAS B. WILLIARD Columbus <P> I See cut. - ED . <P> <P> Sir : <P> I was one of the mothers who protested against the removal of this wonderful children 's program . To my surprise , after looking at this show , I eventually made it a habit of sitting down with my youngster , and derived some entertainment each morning . RUTH FAIGES Newark <P> Sir : <P> So what makes you think only mothers demand Kangaroo Keeshan ? I am a male adult , 32 , and have been more " broken up " over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 30s . <P> <P> FRED W. MCDARRAH New York City <P> Anti-Zionist Rabbi <P> Sir : <P> As the wife of a rabbi , I want to congratulate you on your objective report of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum 's recent visit to Israel Aug. 3 . You have shown fine insight into the character and beliefs of this movement . <P> It must be stressed that this fanatical group is not representative of authentic Judaism . To the contrary , their preachments and ways are in opposition to the basic tenets of Judaism . <P> <P> MRS . BENJAMIN KREITMAN Brooklyn <P> Sir : <P> Your article on Rabbi Teitelbaum and the Hasidic community reeks of cynicism , pro-Israelism , snobbishness and disrespect . I do not necessarily agree with the rabbi or his religious beliefs , but I am glad to see someone raise his voice against the state of Israel . Before this time , anyone who criticized the state of Israel was thought to be antiSemitic . No one , obviously , can accuse Rabbi Teitelbaum of that fault . <P> <P> JOHN TRYFOROS San Francisco <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
