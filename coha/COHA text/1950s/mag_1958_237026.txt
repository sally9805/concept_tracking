At 32,000 ft. in the dark Texas skies , Air Force Lieut . James Edward Obenauf made a split-second , life-and-death decision . Around him , his six-jet B-47* seemed to be falling apart : the right outboard engine was boiling with flame , scattering red-hot pieces of steel across the wing and fuselage . The navigator had bailed out of the nose compartment ; so had the pilot . Copilot Obenauf , squeezing along the catwalk toward the nose , was ready to jump too . He looked down and froze : there , lying unconscious , his oxygen equipment disconnected , his chute pack gone , was the navigator-instructor , Major Joseph B. Maxwell . <P> As the wind roared through the open trap door , " Obie " Obenauf hurriedly searched for Maxwell 's parachute . His body was weakened from lack of oxygen . He could not find the chute . He looked down at Maxwell again , felt an awful , strong urge to leave him . " Gee , I got my own battle to fight . " Then Obie , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father of a ten-month old boy , father-to-be of a second child , turned around and crawled back into his rear cockpit and took control of the airplane on the chance that he might be able to fly it to safety . <P> The Needle . He hooked his mask into the life-saving oxygen system , dove the bomber toward a lower altitude so Maxwell would not die of anoxia . The Plexiglas canopy had been jettisoned in the first attempt at bailout , so , as the plane knifed ahead at 400 knots , Obie 's face was seared by the sharp , - 30 wind , by whipped dust , bits of wire and insulation . His eyelids rolled back in the fierce air torrent . He dropped his amber-tinted visor over his tearing eyes-but he could not read his instruments again without lifting it . His gloved hands froze to near helplessness . Under his seat was the armed , unexploded powder charge that had failed to fire his seat out of the cockpit in the early bail-out try . " You 're so numb , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just numb . " <P> Into the blood-stinging wind he flew . He called his " mayday ! " SOS and got an instant response , first from an Air Force base at Altus , Okla. , 200 miles away , then from another airborne B-47 . Altus gave Obie a compass heading to come in on . His panel lights grew dimmer , his eyes burned like hot lead . He could see the compass needle but not the numbers . He turned his plane to bring the needle toward the heading he wanted : his own field , the Strategic Air Command 's Dyess Air Force Base near Abilene , 150 miles away . <P> The Pearl . The night now hung with bad weather : ceiling , 1,500 ft. ; visibility , five miles ; rain . Maxwell woke up , groggily plugged in his headset . He cut his speed to 200 knots to reduce the buffeting of the plane and the charge of the biting wind . " I think I said about 50 prayers . I thought about everything-the things I used to do when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family . They were the ones I was really fighting for . "
