txt Mayor Wagner plans to name a committee of distinguished citizens to consider the advisability of legalizing off-track betting on horse races . He said yesterday that such betting might provide large amounts of much-needed revenue for ' the city and help wipe out underworld syndicates profiting from the illegal status of offtrack wagering . " But I am telling you for myself and my Police Commissioner Francis W. H. Adams , " the Mayor warned , " that so long . as the present laws against offtrack betting are on the books they will be strictly enforced . " The Mayor 's warning , delivered in a television broadcast from station WNBT , under the sponsorship of the Citizens Union , was viewed in some quarters as his answer to recent rumors that " the lid is off " on off-track betting . In a transcribed broadcast from radio station WCBS , Deputy Mayor Henry Epstein said that he had heard no such rumors , but " should be very much surprised if there was an opening of these so-called bookies under way . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off ' they do n't know Frank Adams , " he declared . Off-Track Betting Favored In his television talk the Mayor made it clear that he was sympathetic toward the legalization of off-track betting . " I have never bet on a horse race away from the track , " he said , " but it has always seemed to me to be hypocritical to permit betting at the track while if orbidding it on the outside . " Legalized betting away from the track would raise revenues for the city and discourage syndicates and other underworld forces now thriving on off-track betting . " The Mayor said that he would take up the matter of naming a citizens committee as soon as other pressing problems of city government were disposed of . He declared that he would seek the views of civic , religious and other community organizations as well as those of a special committee . In a discussion of the city 's fiscal program for 1954-55 and the three following years , the Mayor characterized as " unfair " Governor Dewey 's recent rejection of most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next four fiscal years . Mr. Dewey has described most of the city 's fiscal proposals as " political " and made " in bad faith . " " I do not want or intend to play politics in this matter with Governor Dewey or anyone else , " the Mayor said . " I believe that we have presented a good case . We shall continue to press it and from time to time I intend to explain it in detail to the people of this city . " The Mayor 's 1954-55 fiscal program calls for $115,000,000 of additional city revenue . His over-all program for 1954-58 calls for $227,100,000 of additional income . The Mayor declared that his administration felt obligated to give pay rises to city employes , some of them on an across-theboard basis and some to iron out existing pay inequalities . Because of the present inadequate pay scales , he declared , many city employes are leaving their jobs to take places in private industry and business . This is especially true , he said , of many competent engineers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right direction Governor 1Dewey 's recent proposal to tax trotting races to obtain an addi- tional $25,000,000 to aid schools throughout the state . The city 's share of such a tax would be $11,000,000 . " I 'm glad the Governor has recognized the unfairness of the existing formula for state aid to education , " he said . " Of course the amount the city would get is inadequate . Our program calls for arkadditional $40,000,000 from the state in 1954-55 . " The Mayor declared that his fiscal program would provide a full complement for the Police Department and take care of mandatory increases in pension costs . He expressed the belief that the city " could get by somehow " if this program was rejected by the Legislature , but he warned that it . would mean no improvement and perhaps a curtailment of essential hospital , health and other services to the city 's 8,000,000 inhabitants . The Mayor renewed his suggestion , made last Friday night at the annual awards dinner of the Citizens Budget Commission , that Mr. Dewey join him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statecity fiscal relationship . The Mayor asked that the city have equal representation with the state on such a committee . In his broadcast Deputy Mayor Epstein said that he knew of no " deal " in connection with the Mayor 's recent appointment of former Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri to a $19,500 post as a.lustice of the Court of Special Sessions . He conceded , however , that he could not " probe the operations of the minds of the officials involved . " Mr. Epstein expressed the belief that the cost of city government would continue to rise despite administrative economies . Discussing the city 's fiscal program , . he said that he believed Governor Dewey would " listen to reason . "
