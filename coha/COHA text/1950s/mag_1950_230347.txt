For the past four months , two horses have stood out among the three-year-olds of 1950 . Many horsemen insist that the Kentucky Derby and Belmont winner , Middleground , rates the edge . But Christopher Chenery 's strapping Preakness winner , Hill Prince , probably has as many admirers. * <P> Last week , at Chicago 's Washington Park for the 40th running of the American Derby , Hill Prince made another bid for the title . Although Middleground was not among the nine horses which went to the barrier , the field was a strong one , including William Goetz 's flashy , California-bred Your Host and Calumet Farm 's entry of Theory and All Blue . <P> Hill Prince , after a rigorous spring campaign , had not raced for two months , and he came out full of run . Jockey Eddie Arcaro held the big bay off the pace until the field entered the backstretch , then let him move up on the outside . At the head of the stretch , All Blue* had the lead , but Hill Prince caught him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won by more than a length over All Blue , with Your Host third . Time for the mile and a quarter : a fast 2:01 1/5 . The winner 's purse , $60,050 , brought Hill Prince 's three-year-old earnings to $210,563 , tops in his class . <P> <P> *Including Handicapper John Blanks Camp bell , racing secretary for the New York tracks who last week rated Hill Prince two pounds bet ter than Middleground in assigning weights fa a handicap at Aqueduct . This reversed his pre season rating of Middleground at 126 Ibs. , Hil Prince at 124. *On the eve of the 1949 Kentucky Derby , which Calumet Trainer Ben Jones won with Ponder , a TIME correspondent asked Jones which of his two-year-olds he thought might be his best Derby prospect in 1950 . Jones guessed that All Blue might be ( TIME , May 30 , 1949 ) . Although he came around too late to run in any of the triple crown events , All Blue is now the best three-year-old in Calumet 's barn .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
