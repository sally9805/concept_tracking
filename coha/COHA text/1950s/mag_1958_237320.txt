The Captain from Koepenick ( Real-Film ; D.C.A. ) is a dandy German joke that manages to be only intermittently funny . Now undergoing its third version as a movie , the film is derived from a 1931 play by Carl ( The Blue Angel ) Zuckmayer , who co-authored the present screenplay . It is the story of a lonely , jobless German shoemaker whose drab world turns into a fairyland of wealth , popularity and authority as soon as he dons the dashing and highly illegal uniform of an army captain . <P> Zuckmayer 's true tale springs from the celebrated saga of Wilhelm Voigt , a turn-of-the-century cobbler who lived near Koepenick , a little town eight miles from <P> Berlin . As a young man , Voigt forged 300 marks worth of postal money orders to buy trinkets for his girl , and got a 15-year sentence for the crime . Once out of stir , he could not get a job without papers , and could not get papers without a job . Back in the jug he went , this time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passport for himself . <P> Slowly Voigt caught on to the fact that in militaristic Prussia the badge of authority was invariably accepted as the real thing . Once free , he bought a captain 's uniform and commandeered a squad of soldiers by the simple method of walking up to them and ordering them to follow him . Barking " Los " with all the crisp confidence of a drill instructor , he led his band on a raid of Koepenick 's town hall , arrested the bumbling mayor and treasurer , walked off with the contents of the town till . Later , after Voigt gave himself up in return for a promise of getting his passport , the Kaiser was told about the escapade . Chuckling appreciatively , the Kaiser , according to the film , commented : " See , that 's discipline . You wo n't find that anywhere else on earth . " <P> U.S. viewers may chuckle less heartily than the Kaiser . In reworking Voigt 's escapade , Scriptwriter Zuckmayer dillydallies interminably in the soupy background of the hoax , gets down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film . And where The Captain calls for gusts of high-velocity satire , Zuckmayer gives it only windy philosophizing ( " We 're just entries on paper , " mourns Voigt . " We 're not human beings " ) . Chief honors for giving The Captain the moderate amount of appeal it has go to Veteran Heinz Rhmann , whose shuffling , beagle-faced portrayal of Voigt won him last year 's best-actor award from the German government . <P> The Light in the Forest ( Buena Vista ) is a Walt Disney film about Indians . Delving no deeper than a cat lapping milk from a saucer , Disney has churned out yet another strong-legged , soft-headed pioneer epic , in which each character , action and motive is painted in shrieking monotone . Taken from the 1953 novel by Pulitzer Prizewinning Author Conrad Richter , the story revolves sluggishly around the efforts of a boy ( James MacArthur ) to resist being taken back to his white parents after having grown up as the adopted son of a Delaware Indian chief . On hand to make sure the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fess Parker ) . Actor MacArthur , who is built like a fireplug and is not much more expressive , sets out to make a mess of Fess . He swings at him with a rifle butt , wrestles with him in the muddy Ohio River . But sure ' nuff , he ends up back at the ranch , gloomily sitting in an old metal tub muttering , " Indian no stink , white man stink . "
