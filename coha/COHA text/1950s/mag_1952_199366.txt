After Douglas MacArthur began to talk politics last summer , there were indications that he favored Robert A. Taft for President . MacArthur steadfastly kept his name out of primaries , talked like a Taft man , but made no announcement . When he refused to enter the New Hampshire primary , a slate of delegates filed as MacArthur men , insisted he was available as a candidate , and made plans to broadcast , on primary eve , recordings of his famous address to Congress . <P> That was too much for former State Senator J. Wesley Colburn of Nashua , who had withdrawn as chairman of the state 's MacArthur-for-President movement at the general 's request . To get things straight , he wrote MacArthur a letter : Should the general 's admirers support the MacArthur-pledged slate , or someone else ? The old soldier penned a note at the bottom of the letter , mailed it back to Colburn . In the note was the long-expected " announcement " : " I thank you for your note . Under the circumstances I suggest you support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week : <P> North Dakota 's Senator Milton R. Young , a member of the Senate Republican Policy Committee , shocked his colleagues by announcing that he is for Georgia 's Senator Richard Russell , the Southern Democrats ' candidate .
