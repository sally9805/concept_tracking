With more than 7,000 miles of connected airlanes running right up the center of the U.S. , Braniff International Airways and Mid-Continent Airlines have long believed that two can live cheaper than one . During 1951 , Braniff gave Mid-Continent $334.857 in interline business , while Mid-Continent handed Braniff $270,113 worth of passengers and freight . - Last week the two decided to take the big step and merge . If stockholders of both lines and the Civil Aeronautics Board approve , 1 shares of Mid-Continent common stock will be exchanged for each share of Braniff . The new line , to be called Braniff , will have 58 planes , serve 35 cities ( including Tulsa , Kansas City , Houston and Chicago ) in twelve states . It willbe the sixth biggest U.S. airline .
