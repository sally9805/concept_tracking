txt Beset by Communists on the one hand - and the Peronistas on the other , Frondizi will have to abandon his old , habit of erratic responses to factional  --  pressures and setout on an independent course of his own or his government will tall . He can no longer retreat and he has passed the point of Compromise . Hostile Groups The trouble has been , in the words of one Argentine expert here , " Frondizi has been trying to be all things to all men . " He won his Job last January  --  in Argentina 's first free election in 20 years  --  with the backing of Communists , labor , the followers of exdictator Juan Peron and his own Intransigent Radical party . Since then President Frondizi has been trying to do the impossible , please all these implacably hostile groups . Communists have been free to spread their propaganda , Peron 's followers openly campaign for the return of their exiled champion and the military has intermittently threatened to topple the regime unless Frondizi cracks down on the others . Restive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Argentine authorities claim Vice President Alejandro Gomez has led an attempt coup . Vice President Gomez denies the charges , but whatever their validity , an attempted coup d'etat is what many diplomats and private observers in and out of Argentina have been predicting for months . To understand why , go back to September , 1953 , when the Army , Navy and Catholic Church combined to oust the corrupt dictator who had ruled since World War H. Peron and many of his cohorts fled the country but the strong following Peron had built up in the labor unions remained loyal . The provisional government which took over under General Pedro Aramburu and the Navy 's Admiral Isaac Rojas found things in a mess Economic troubles topped the list . Large foreign exchange reserves built up from World War Id 's high prices for Argentine wheat , wool and beef had been depleted . Railways were broken down , power was short , industry stagnant and inflation spiraling . The provisional regime tried to get Argentina back on the track economically with borrowings from Uncle Sam and with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it tried to keep down the Peronistas . Latin American politics being what it is. however , Peronist leaders returned and Peron kept giving orders to his followers from outside the country . When February 's Presidential election came around , then , it became apparent that the man who came up with the disciplined Peronist vote would be a man to be reckoned with . And that 's where Dr. Arturo Frondizi came in . Foreign Capital The thin , balding . 50-year-old candidate talked about national control of utilities and implied continued tight reins on business in general . But he also indicated he would n't be unbending in seeking foreign capital for development of the Argentine oil industry Most important , he promised freedom for all political groups  --  which appealed to Peronistas and Communists alike . Frondizi has never had any illusions that his tenure of power would be an easy one . One of his first moves on winning the election from Moderate leader Ricardo Balbin was to seek out leaders of groups which had not supported him to try to win them over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his career ; not at all a back-slapping politician . he is quite persuasive in meetings with small groups of influential men . The Argentine President is a bespectacled , ascetic-appearing man of Italian descent , the eighth of nine sons in a family of 14 . His immigrant father was a contractor who worked in Argentina 's northeast frontier late in the last century , enjoying prosperity at first but then falling on less happy times . The future President largely worked his own way toward an education , entering law school at 19 and graduating with the highest honors in leas-than-usual time . As a student he was " anti-dictator " and found his way into the Intransigent Radical party which he would come to dominate . He rose more as an intellectual than as a political organizer , specializing in political theory and writing speeches . As a member of the House of Deputies , however , he blossomed as a debater . In the early 1940 , ' s when the Peron regime was consolidating its power , he frequently took issue with it on the parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised an immediate political amnesty to all , including Peronista. and a government " based on law . " The hope was that thus Communists and Peronista would be won to constitutional government . But these groups turned against him and his constitutional regime . So now , Mr. Frondizi should logically be expected to turn against them with the vigor he has at times through his career shown signs of . This seems even more logical if the military stays on his side , since the armed forces have been outspokenly anti-Peron . With such formidable opposition , how can Mr. Frondizi emerge a stronger president ? Most importantly , he can achieve greater leadership simply by slashing all pretense of ties with the troublemaking Peronistas and Communists , Latin American experts here believe . As long as he catered to them , he weakened his support from the armed forces and other elements in the country . Therefore , it 's argued , the president will likely now press through Congress measures which he would have brushed aside otherwise . Fear of Labor Americans expect the president to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets out of this crisis . The Argentine administration has been talking of balancing the government budget , but has shown questionable resolve about carrying through on this aim . One reason for this wishy-washy approach is thought to be fear of how labor would react . Now , many officials expect , Frondizi will be less concerned about pleasing labor . Senor Frondizi could  --  and many here believe he will -- use the  --  strong powers he now holds by virtue of the state of siege declared for the country to raise prices on food and other subsidized items . He could put down Peronista objections with the Army , because he has few political debts to these groups any longer , it 's reasoned . An International Monetary Fund mission is in Argentina at the government 's request looking at the countryis economic troubles today . Men here who know the thinking of Mr. Frondizi 's top advisers believe the administration wants to follow the Fund 's recommendations whatever they are and will do so now . A firm Frondizi could also mean that he will stick to his plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that Argentina must boost its oil output if it is to stop the steady drain on its foreign exchange caused by large fuel imports . By purging Vice President Gomez and other opponents from his administration as he appears ready to do , Senor Frondizi should have la tighter national leadership working with him , Latin American experts think . None of this means that Peron 's power is broken for good . The oil unions have only put off , not cancelled , their threatened nation-wide strike Economic trouble remains acute , holding the seeds for future labor uprisings . Latin American politicians have personal ambitions which undoubtedly will encourage some leader to try again to unseat the president But , just as in the U S . the national leaders who bring the nation through crises are those who " stand for something " and can sell it to the people . If he survives this crisis , Senor Frondizi 's task seems to be that of selling his brand of politics to the people .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
