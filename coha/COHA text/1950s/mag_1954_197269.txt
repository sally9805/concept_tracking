Strangely enough , the strongman who had once bent 40 million Brazilians to his will turned out to be a donothing President . He worked hard but ineffectually , giving so much time and energy to political maneuvering that almost none was left for establishing the leadership that he , of all Brazilians , might have proclaimed . <P> Two years after Vargas had promised to roll back food prices , living costs had climbed 30% , and 250,000 Sao Paulo workers quit their factories in hunger-sparked strikes .
