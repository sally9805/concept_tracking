The first Soviet artist of stature to perform in the U.S. since Composer-Pianist Sergei Prokofiev 's visit 34 years ago is Emil Gilels , who comes as Soviet Russia 's " foremost pianist . " Following the " spirit of Geneva , " he was admitted to the U.S. as an " official " so that he would not have to be fingerprinted under the McCarran Immigration Act . But his fingers are making an unforgettable impression on U.S. audiences . <P> When Conductor Eugene Ormandy asked Gilels ( pronounced Gill-ells ) what he wanted to play at his opening concerts with the Philadelphia Orchestra in Philadelphia and New York , Gilels suggested : Beethoven 's Third , Prokofiev 's Third , the Tchaikovsky Concerto No. 1 . He meant all three , was pained to learn that Ormandy had chosen only one-the Tchaikovsky . As Pianist Gilels stepped onto the stage of Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall last week , his short , stocky figure made him look boyish , his high cheekbones and flat face made him look Russian . But he did not seem alien . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down before getting down to business . Then , after the orchestra swept into the big , resonant opening chords , Gilels hammered out the all too familiar response with incredible vitality . His notes were crisp without dryness , brassy without clangor . With his chestnut hair tossing over his face , he played as if he believed that he was waging a titanic struggle against the inexorable orchestra . <P> Little intricacies came through as if etched , loud octaves as if the fingers of his right and left hands were attached by a coupling mechanism . Gilels ' brilliance left some listeners with the same feeling in the ear that a flash of lightning can cause in the eyes . <P> When the concerto ended , Gilels got an ovation that would have made most Western pianists euphoric . The Russian never cracked a smile . At 39 , Gilels is used to applause , having played his first concert at twelve ( in his native Odessa ) . No single concerto can be a thorough test of a pianist 's capabilities . The full measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he gives a Carnegie Hall recital without orchestra . Meanwhile , it was plain that the Soviet pianist is a phenomenal technician with conviction and passion . Leaving the stage after last week 's concert , Ormandy was heard to say : " This boy really purifies a work that has become vulgarized through use and misuse . He is one of the greatest .
