In the name of culture , the top people of Florence were kept busy last week entertaining delegates to the fifth annual conference of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization . The Business and Professional Women 's Club poured tea in a villa where according to legend Giovanni Boccaccio met one of the voluptuous heroines of his Decameron . An Italian movie company held a special screening of an animated cartoon called The Rose of Baghdad , which allegedly had been inspired by the work of UNESCO . No one was quite sure what Boccaccio or Baghdad had to do with the organization 's work ; but then , <P> UNESCO had never been quite sure what its work was supposed to be . <P> Maana Means Today . Meeting in the gilded and brocaded halls of the Pitti Palace , delegates presented a total of 86 new proposals . Among them : a request to draw up a list of sources for an economic history from the 11th to the 16th Centuries , a suggestion that UNESCO collect material on teaching evolutionary biology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether pertinent to UNESCO 's director general , Jaime Torres Bodet , Mexico 's able former Minister of Education , who is an impatient man . Cracked one UNESCO representative last week : " For Torres Bodet , manana means today . " Bodet had a pet project of his own-nothing more nor less than peace . He favored a Yugoslav suggestion for an international intellectual congress for peace , a Belgian proposal to form a committee to study the effects of new weapons , a Czech plan to outlaw atomic weapons . When the conference rejected these projects , Bodet got sore . Cried Bodet : " I ask the conference to place on the agenda the selection of my successor . " <P> Conscience Examined . With only four days of the conference left , a group of delegates got together in a secret midnight session , next day brought forth a petition , signed by 35 countries , urging Torres Bodet to reconsider his resignation . He received a similar cabled appeal from the U.N . ' s Trygve Lie . He agreed to return to his job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a conference of an examination of conscience . . . That , of course , is not everything , but is very much . . . " <P> The fact was that for UNESCO , maana still meant the day after tomorrow .
