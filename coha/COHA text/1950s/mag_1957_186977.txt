LIVING COSTS HIT NEW PEAK , cried the headlines . Up went the U.S. Consumer Price Index by one-half of 1% during the month of July to its eleventh successive monthly alltime high , adding up to a creeping 3.2% inflation since July 1956 , a decline of 20.8% in the spending power of the dollar since 1947-49 ( see BUSINESS . ) <P> Up went doctors ' bills , cosmetics , TV repairs , outweighing light " declines in clothing and household appliances . Up above all went the cost of food-bacon by an average 6/ a pound , round steak by 4 and frying chickens by 2 , eggs by 6 a dozen-to climb above its peak ( before the farm recession ) in August 1952 . <P> Automatically , the new inflation will bring wage increases of one to 6 an hour for 1,300,000 workers in automobile , electrical , farm-equipment and trucking industries whose contracts are geared to wage-cost escalator clauses-thereby automatically creating more inflation .                   @ @
