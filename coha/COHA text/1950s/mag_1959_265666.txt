In Chicago , hog prices dipped to their lowest level in years : $15.50 per 100 Ibs. , down 75 from the first part of the week and nearly $10 below the peak prices paid a year earlier . As the price of live hogs fell , supermarkets slashed prices of pork products . Hams sold at 49 per lb. , 12 below last year ; sausage at 45 , down 2O ; center-cut pork chops at 79 , against 99 a year ago . <P> The immediate cause of the price break was a sharp 12% rise in the size of the 1959 spring pig crop . Farmers had been encouraged to increase farrowings , because corn was plentiful and cheap . The Administration 's new program of guaranteeing corn prices at $1.12 per bu. , without limitation on corn acreage , has resulted in a huge crop increase . This year farmers will grow 4.2 billion bushels of corn , up from 1958 's record 3.8 billion-bushel crop and nearly a billion above the ten-year average of 3.3 billion bushels       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
