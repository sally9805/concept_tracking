The hottest young trainer at the race tracks this winter is Allen Jerkens , a tall , diffident man of 26 who feeds his horses olive oil and has an enviable habit of turning second-rate platers into stake-race winners . When Florida 's Hialeah opened last week , the two-buck bettors made Jerkens ' " Big Horse , " Admiral Vee , a 3-to-5 favorite . It was a little too early in the season to be sure the chestnut was ready , but the horseplayers knew that a Jerkens horse would always give them a run for their money . <P> Admiral Vee ran an honest race , finished second and earned $1,500 , to add to the nearly $300,000 purse income brought home by Jerkens-trained horses in the last year . Jerkens had no complaints . " I 've always had hard-knocking horses that brought home a check most every time they ran , " he said . " It 's those kind of horses that keep the wolf away . Besides , it 's better to have Admiral coming on than to have him run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a long winter ! " <P> Son of an expatriate Hungarian cavalryman who ran a Long Island livery stable , Jerkens has spent most of his life around horses , was only 15 when he bought his first mount , an unfashionable , sore-legged colt named Crack Time . He spent long , cold months patching up his purchase and galloping the horse through the snow . By the time racing started at Aqueduct , Crack Time was ready . The cheap colt won $12,615 before it was lost in a $10,000 claiming race . <P> As soon as Jerkens turned 21 , he got his trainer 's license . He managed to ride out bad years by practicing what his father had preached : he worked over each horse as carefully as if it were the only one in his string . He went on claiming second-rate nags and turning them into winners with such consistent success that other trainers joked that he must be using some magical " Jerkens Lotion . " <P> But Jerkens insists that he harbors no training secrets . Says he : " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : mix olive oil in their mash , pick greens for them , and hope for the best . If they 're sore , you tub them and ice them . Lots of good trainers just do n't get the breaks , but some years you get lucky . " Allen Jerkens has been getting so lucky so often that many horsemen now make him a factor in their handicapping-along with a horse 's bloodlines , its past performances and its jockey .
