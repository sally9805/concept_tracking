txt Setters to The Times SRAEL GOLDSTEINJERRY WURF , CHARLOTTE CARR , E.R. HACK. g. 30 Letters to The Times War Crime Stand Questioned Amnesty Criticized as Departing From Nuremberg Principles To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The action of High Commissioner McCloy and General Handy in mitigating the sentences of a large number of German war criminals was based largely on the recommendation of two review boards . There is significance in the statement of one of the boards that " it would undo what Nuremberg has accomplished if in the end we were guided entirely by the consideration of sympathy or generosity . " Yet , tragically , that is exactly what the set of decisions did . While it is true that seven death sentences were confirmed , it is equally true and more meaningful that twentyone death sentences , including those of men convicted for mass extermination , were commuted , and that a total of sixty-eight out of the other eighty sentences reviewed were mitigated . Neither the facts nor the justice of the original sentences was challenged in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , officially , were grounded in executive clemency for men guilty of heinous crimes . There is a clear lack of logic behind these sweeping revisions which inevitably saps at the strength of the Nuremberg code . Mr. McCloy took great pains to point out that his decisions were " rooted in the firm belief in the basic principle of the rule of law . " But what happens to that " basic principle " when men who have so clearly violated the code of civilization are treated so generously ? Does not that " basic principle " include the long-established tradition that there must be legal sense behind the mitigation of sentences ? Basis for Clemency Executive clemency exists for a specific reason . That reason is clear : law is of general application , judges are bound by law and yet there are instances when defendants , though convicted of violating the fact of the law , are entitled to redress which judges by their very nature can not grant . It follows that , in such cases , clemency is based not upon general considerations but upon specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts surrounding the particular crime . Such is the situation in the United States , where no Governor will commute a death sentence unless there are unusual circumstances involved . Otherwise , crime would not be effectively punished and the entire system of law , designed to protect civilization , would be menaced . To believe that individual clemency is justifiable in 89 out of 110 cases is ludicrous . One is forced reluctantly to the belief that expediency is involved . The - suspicion of expediency becomes even stronger when it is realized that a number of these cases have gone through the entire review process provided by law in the American zone before the special boards appointed by General Handy and Mr. McCloy came into existence . We are thus presented with the unusual spectacle of review piled upon review . Record of Convicted Mr. McCloy , in his statement of justification , also said that he endeavored to " temper justice with mercy . " Certainly no one would attempt to deny that mercy is an important attribute of civilization . But under any normal standard of judgment it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , like most of those whose cases were acted upon last week , slaughtered hostages , indulged in mass murder or carried out Nazi slave labor policies . Even if this were not so , certainly the principles established at Nuremberg hardly five years ago are as important to our society as mercy itself and are , in fact , based on the concept of mercy to all men . A law which is not adequately enforced , as the review board 's statement itself implies , rapidly becomes a travesty . There can be little respect for the code of Nuremberg when , as has occurred over the past two years , dozens of war criminals are released . Either the world is to be built upon the rule of law or it is not . In commuting the death sentences of the men who shot down unarmed American soldiers at Malm ? dy , General Handy said that these offenses were " associated with confused , fluid and desperate combat action  --  a last attempt to turn the tide , * * * " Such dubious logic must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocities , such as the opponent America now faces in the Far East . We can not have it both ways ? it is rather useless to seek condemnation by the civilized world of present atrocities or to attempt to prevent future atrocities when those of the recent past are , it appears , being whitewashed . Today , when we have learned to our sorrow how depraved man can become in times of war particularly and when another war threatens , we must uphold the unique experience of Nuremberg , where for the first time crimes against humanity were duly punished .

Attendance Bureau Reform Proposed Bill Is Favored , Staff Performance Discussed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIDIES : Your editorial of Feb. 6 in support of the Mitchell-Brook bill , which woul ( make possible new leadership in the " untouchable " Bureau of Attendance with its ' ' unenlightened , antiquated ap ? proach to the problem of truancy , ' highlighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMES of the same date reports a startling sample of this " unenlightened approach . " Mark Levien , counsel for the Supervising Attendance Officers Association , is quoted as saying that the Bureau of Attendance is supposed merely to enforce the compulsory school law , continuation school law and to maintain the school census . In his statement Mr. Levien manages to contradict Dr. William Jansen , Superintendent of Schools , as to the character of attendance work in the schools , and his own clients , the supervising attendance officers , who have expressed their complete agreement with Dr. Jansen 's interpretation of their task . Dr. Jansen ( in a sworn affidavit to the Supreme Court of New York ) testifies that " * * * the basic philosophy of attendance work has changed mal terially since the Bureau of Attendance was first established , in 1920 . The primary if not exclusive objective was to bring children back to school who were illegally absent . * * * It is now recognized that illegal absence or truancy is a symptom of emotional , social , physical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to child . In view of this , the character of attendance work requires much broader approach to the problem of absence , with emphasis on the social casework method . " In the annual report of the Bureau of Attendance for the year 1947-48 Eugene 0 . Cavanagh , acting director , points to the need for " guidance work and the minute casework techniques " on the part of attendance officers , and calls for courses that " will assist our field staff in noting symptoms of maladjustment , locating the causes and planning for the amelioration of these negative factors . " In short , Mr. Levien is all alone in his belief that the Bureau of Attendance is supposed " merely to enforce the compulsory education law " and that truancy is not a special problem . He does not seem to know that his clients agree fully with those who advocate reform of the . Bureau of Attendance as to the grave responsibilities inherent in attendance work . Reform is needed because  --  owing mainly to the lack of skilled leadership  --  the actual performance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated understanding . The provisions of the Mitchell-Brook bill will not be seen as a threat by qualified supervisory members of the Bureau of Attendance staff but as an instrument for making sure that the best talent is secured for such an important position .

Fishing Through the Ice To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I read with considerable amusement your article of Feb. 2 regarding ice fishing in upstate New York . The article was amusing because those whom you purport to set up as being supermen because they sit in a shack on the ice would , in our upstate area , be considered sissies . Our game laws prohibit the use of any protection on the ice other than a five-foot-square wood or canvas windbreak . No one bothers with even a windbreak , and there are thousands of us out each week-end fishing for blue gills . Actually , keeping warm is no problem . First , we don all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , when the cold permeates the body , which happens regardless of clothing , we merely cut another hole through the **28;166;TOOLONG ice . This will warm up anyone , even your shanty dwellers . Of course , when the blue gills are biting , it is never cold , even though the hands are wet , blue and practically stiff from handling fish and bait . The fish are very tasty when taken from these cold waters , but they must be cleaned before frying . This chore can be eliminated by giving away the fish after they are caught . So , you see , the whole thing is very simple . E. R.
