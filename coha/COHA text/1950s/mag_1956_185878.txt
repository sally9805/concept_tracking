All over Europe last week , the shortage of oil from the Middle East clamped a squeeze on consumers and industry alike . With only enough oil for about two months , the French government watched helplessly as panicky Parisians besieged gasoline stations-and prudently began hoarding every other commodity , from coal to soap ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . Britain , which announced that official gas rationing will start in two weeks , is little better off . Estimates are that oil reserves will last through January . Then Britain will have to reduce consumption 25% or more , depending on how much oil it can import from the U.S. <P> Oil austerity in Britain will reduce 3,750,000 private motorists to a maximum 10 gals . ( 200 miles ) per month . Taxis will have to do with 33% less gas , trucks with 25% less , farmers with 10% less , and home owners with 25% less fuel oil . While Britain 's industry uses less oil than most , oil-fueled steelmakers must cut production 10% , and the auto industry , which was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutbacks . Cars slated for export are piling up on the docks because of the shipping shortage , and gas rationing at home has knocked the bottom out of the domestic market . <P> <P> For Britain 's finances , the Suez crisis will cut two ways . Not only will Britain lose the money it makes selling oil from its Middle Eastern fields , but it may also have to shell out as much as $500 million to $600 million from its slim $2.2 billion gold-and-dollar reserves to buy oil in the West . Though Britain 's treasury hopes to muddle through , its reserves will probably tumble to a new postwar low . <P> Across Europe the pattern was the same : <P> <P> Germany , which at first regarded the shortage with hearty optimism , has taken a second look and clamped on unofficial rationing by cutting gasoline and fuel-oil deliveries by up to 20% . Despite earlier reports of big reserves , Germany 's actual crude oil in storage probably totals no more than one month 's supply ; some steelmakers , iron foundries , chemical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Spain , Belgium and The Netherlands are all in trouble with short supplies , are trying to reduce consumption as much as 20% . In Spain , gas hoarding has drained Madrid 's gas pumps dry , and all three nations expect industrial slowdowns and price rises . <P> Norway , Denmark and Sweden are cutting deliveries to dealers by 10% to 20% , are talking of formal rationing soon . Swedish industry depends on oil for 44% of its total fuel ; production has already been cut back at the Volvo auto factory by 30% . <P> Greece , which is cutting fuel-oil consumption , will also ration gasoline by the simple expedient of banning all cars with odd-numbered licenses from the road on odd days of the week , all even-numbered cars on even days . <P> The Suez Canal closing was also beginning to pinch the Arabs . With its markets cut off , Kuwait , the biggest Middle East producer , cut back production to an estimated 75% of its normal 1,200,000 bbls. daily ; Iraq 's Kirkuk field is down to 200,000 bbls. daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia , Aramco has reduced production 30% from its usual one million-plus barrels daily .
