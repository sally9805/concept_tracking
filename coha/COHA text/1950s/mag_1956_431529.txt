 | Monaco : Gem of the Mediterranean MONACO ? usually called , incorrectly , Monte Carlo ? is celebrated for its gambling , its Prince , its beauty , but most of all for its size : less than one mile square , its ; 68 acres would fit neatly in New York City 's Central Park . It is a ribbon of rock whose length you can walk in less than an hour . There are no signs or boundary gates to pass as you enter the tiny principality . You are driving in France and , suddenly , there you are ? in Monaco . Nobody asks for your passport . Tiny the country may be , but it has more visitors than most larger countries ? 1,500,000 last year . It has most of the things big nations have , like a flag ( red and white ) , a language , an army , a parliament , a police force , museums , a railroad and a bus line . It also has some things other nations would like to have , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the country going for a year without collecting any taxes , and now Grace Kelly . Monaco is bounded on the north . east and west by France . on the south by the Mediterranean . Curving about a wide bay , it looks like a vast open-air movie theater with  | nothing on the stage but the sea . This is a country on a slant . There are few level streets ; the rest are ramps or narrow , winding staircases hewn out of rock . The houses , with their red , brown and pink roofs , step up the hillsides on narrow terraces . There are probably more steps going up and down than anywhere else on earth . The ruler of this petty principality can trace his lineage back in a straight line to the early days of monarchy in Europe . And of today 's monarchs he is the only one who still retains absolute power ; he signs documents " Rainier III , sovereign by the grace of God . " His country 's history goes back more than 2000 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost security , for this was and is a stronghold of enormously thick walls rooted in the top of a crag 200 feet above the sea , practically impregnable in the days before gunpowder . In the 13th century a Genoese named Francois Grimaldi dressed his troops in the brown garb of Franciscan monks and wheedled the occupants of the fortress into opening the gates . Whereupon the intruders took over ? and the Grimaldi family has been in charge , with few interruptions , ever since . The thick walls of the fort still sit on the rock ; old muzzle-loading artillery pieces still peep through apertures ; and slitted watchtowers , like lamps on old caravels , adorn its corners . For all its smallness , the country is divided into three parts called " cities . " One " city " is La Condamine , where the office buildings , most of the shops and factories and the central market are situated . The youngest part of the nation , less than 100 years old , and the most famous and the noisiest is Monte Carlo . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling spot , stands at the edge of the Mediterranean . It is also the site of the opera , the theater , the principal hotels , the grand restaurants , the four night clubs . This is where the live-pigeon-shooting contests take place ; where one of Europe 's great automobile races , the breakneck Grand Prix de Monte Carlo , roars once a year through roped-oil streets . The third division of the country is called Monaco and is technically the capital . Here the Prince has hil palace and the government its of flees . Perched on a rock high in the air , it is the loveliest and oldest par with narrow medieval streets an winding alleys . Standing before the palace are comic-opera soldiery , on guard peppermint-striped sentry boxe The uniforms of this army ? 69 strong ? are gaudy , a little like th parade-ground best of the U. S. Mai rines , with dressmaker touches o cockades , blue helmets and whirl of braid in the sleeves . The men ar volunteers and in the army for life . They do their drilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it in their own country . In Monaco @# their activities are confined to standing still and changing guard . Severtimes a day the replacements are piped in , the old guard is piped out . t is done with a toy-town stiffness worthy of Buckingham Palace . Of the 52 nationalities represented among the country 's 20,000 residents , most are French or Italian . There are about 400 Britishers and o Americans . Only 3000 are true onegasques ? that is , citizens with he right to vote . ( It takes three gmrations to make a citizen : a parent nd a grandparent must have been ern in Monaco before you . ) But . nether you were born there or not , nee you establish residence you pay o personal income tax . Business axes are levied , but they are much lower than elsewhere , with the result that hundreds of European ompanies have incorporated in onaco and set up dummy offices escape taxes in the countries here they do most of their business . A century ago few people in Euope had heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace and a scattering of peasants ' huts . he only communication with the outside world was the daily steamer from Nice , nine miles away . It was shrewd French businessman named Francois Blanc who brought lonaco romance and unprecedented prosperity . In 1863 the Prince , Charles III , signed a contract permitting the enterprising Monsieur Blanc to operate . , gambling casino on what was then stony waste by the sea . In deference to the monarch this was called Mount Charles , later changed to Monte Carlo . With a flair for publicity recalling P. T. Barnum , the Frenchman began attracting the world 's attention to the place . He laid down paved streets , introduced gas lighting , built a first-class hotel beside his gambling house . He persuaded the French Government to hurry the extension of the railroad to Monaco . To entice people to his establishment , Monsieur Blanc supplied the finest food and wine without cost , and added an orchestra , dance floor and show . He brought in the best opera companies and virtuosos . The operas of Berlioz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Diaghilev established his ballet there . In a few years Monte Carlo had all the trappings of the beau monde . Roulette and baccarat had become signs of social importance ? and Monte Carlo became the place to play them . Everyone who was anyone went there , including most of the crowned heads of Europe , the @# 1 22 THE READER 'S DIGEST peerage of Great Britain and millionaires from the United States and South America . And mingling with the great were those who preyed on them : cocottes , gigolos , confidence men and international spies . Chips were unknown ; all play was in gold or silver ? gold louis ( worth $4 ) and American silver dollars . Monsieur Blanc got rich , earning up to 25 million dollars a year , while most of his patrons got poorer . Out of his take he shouldered the entire budget of Monaco , built parks and roadways , put in sewage systems and financed public-welfare projects . A few players were lucky , although usually not for long . Perhaps the most famous was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank at Monte Carlo . " He was an Englishman , Charles Wells , who won $200,000 in three days ? sitting for 11 hours daily at a roulette table . ( Later he returned and lost most of it . ) Actually , he did not break the bank ; he merely won all the money available at one table . Considering that the Casino keeps on hand a million dollars in cash and can get more at short notice , cleaning it out of funds is impossible . Another man who did well was also British : Charles Daggers , an engineer in a Manchester textile mill . He detected a slight flaw in one of the roulette wheels and thus w able to win about 100,000 . Sin that time , Casino officials test t wheels each morning with levels and calipers to make sure they re perfectly . Surprisingly , this capital of the gambling world has almost no set ous crime . One reason is the exq lent 16o-man police force ? the largest in the world for the size of country . These tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a crofilm library of almost every known major criminal on both si of the Atlantic .
