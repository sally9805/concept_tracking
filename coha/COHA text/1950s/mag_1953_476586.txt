MY DAUGHTER , now in her nineteenth year , was asking me the other day which of the younger novelists and poets were being most discussed when I myself began to write professionally at the end of the first war . We talked of Edward Shanks and J. C. Squire ; of Katherine Mansfield , Aldous Huxley , and Romer Wilson . She went on to ask whose subsequent career had most surprised me . That was an easy question . Of the strange vicissitudes of fortune that can befall a writer , the whole course of literary history provides no more ironic example than Hugh Walpole , and the recent publication of Rupert Hart Davies ' excellent biography makes his case once more topical . It is a curious story . In 1918 W. L. George debated in a book of essays , A Novelist on Novels , as to who would have proved themselves by 1940 to be the successors of Conrad , Bennett , Calsworthy , and Wells . Of . the dozen or so candidates whose claims he championed , Walpole 's stock stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author of Mr. Perrin and Mr. Traill and Fortitude , he had been selected for special praise by Henry James in a long influential article on the modern novel in the Times Literary Supplement . The war had consolidated his position . Bad eyesight unfitted him for the army , - but he went to Russia in a Red Cross unit , acquiring an O.B.E. and a Russian decoration . In his spare time he wrote two novels about Russiain the Russian manner . He also in January 1918 published The Green Mirror ? a very English novel on which he had been at work before the war . With The Green Mirror he changed publishers , leaving Secker for Macmillan . The Macmillan people do not take up a writer unless they are satisfied that he has a long and honorable career ahead of him . Their imprint was the imprimatur on Walpole 's reputation . He was then thirty-one and the ball lay at his feet . I never knew Walpole well , but I met him fairly often over twenty years , particularly during the nineteen-twenties . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressively disposed . He had a large house near Regent 's Park where he housed his library and pictures and entertained his friends . He was a familiar figure at first nights , at publishers ' parties , and at ladies ' clubs where dinner was followed by short speeches by seven or eight writers . He had a cottage in Cornwall to which he retired for quiet and concentration . He went to America most years . Everything was going well , everything promised to go well . Each book sold better than the last . His lectures were a great success ; to American audiences he seemed the embodiment of all that was best in Britain . He was tall , broad , with a bulldog chin . Incipient baldness accentuated his high-domed forehead . He was fresh complexioned ; one interviewer nicknamed him " Apple-cheeked Hugh . " He had a boyish eagerness ; he looked thoroughly wholesome ; no " flim-flam " about him ; he had an easy forthcoming manner . His father was an Anglican bishop and he had an inherited aptitude for oratory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences well . I heard him lecture once in Brighton , and I can well remember the spontaneous outburst of applause that greeted an eloquent tribute to Walter Scott . Ile enjoyed lecturing . He appeared to be sorry when his time was up . II E WAS active in literary politics . As a critic he was generous in his appreciations ; always ready to introduce with a preface an American writer to the British public ; on such occasions he would often contrive a compliment to one or other of his friends . His preface to Cabell 's Jurgen is an example of this , with its dragged-in reference to J. D. Beresford 's Signs and Wonders . He was anxious to have his friends share in his own good fortune . He was worried at the difficulties young writers were experiencing in getting their work published , and in the autumn of 1919 he wrote a letter to the Times Literary Supplement that started a long correspondence on first novels . Feeling that there should be closer contact between authorship and the trade , he founded the Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed their separate and joint problems at monthly dinners . The Society still flourishes . Its first secretary was Maurice Marston , then one of the partners in the now defunct publishing house of Leonard Parsons . Later when the National Book League was formed Marston was its organizing secretary . It is very possible that but for Walpole , the League would never have been formed . He had a full and happy life . I recall a lunch party of St. John Ervine 's at the Garrick Club in 1926 . It was a mixed party , eight of us at a round table . Walpole was in high spirits . He did not monopolize the conversation , but the talk centered round him . I can not remember anything he said . He was not a witty talker ; he was good company not because he said clever things but because he was interested and enthusiastic . It was a small room and we took our coffee where we sat . We were still at table when a club servant announced , " Mr , Walpole 's car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room we started to discuss him . We agreed that he was the happiest man we knew . St. John Ervine wondered if he had ever had an unhappy hour . We were still discussing him When the door opened and he reappeared . There had been a mistake ? it had not been his car after all . Conversation ceased . Walpole looked round the table . " Well , what were you saying about me behind my back ? " he asked . The pause continued . It was a little awkward . Then Mrs. Theodore McKenna spoke . She was the senior person present , and one of his best friends . " As a matter of fact , Hugh , we were saying how happy you were , and how glad we were about it . We were wondering whether you had ever been unhappy . " It was said on a note of genuine affection , but for a moment Walpole seemed disconcerted . I fancied that I knew what he was thinking . Dostoevski 's stock stood high . The man who had not suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walpole did not relish the suggestion that lie had not suffered . At the same time he did not want to disparage his own good fortune . He had had bad times , he said , times he would not care to live again , but as for these last ten years , well , he had to admit they had been very , very good . He had been happy pretty well all the time . II T HAT was in 1926 : And he was not able to say that much longer . When he died fifteen years later , he was a saddened man . That for a writer is a fate by no means unusual . Fashions change ; writers lose their talent and appeal ; they are lucky if they saved money in their good years . " Walpole 's fate was different . Charles Morgan has told in The House of Macmillan that Walpole worked on a ten-year schedule and right to the end he kept to his program . The last half of the twenties and the thirties were a period of solid industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels , sold very well . Between these volumes he published shorter but creditable books . He made a great deal of money . He was knighted . To a foreigner , to anyone outside London and New York literary society , he must have seemed to occupy a highly enviable position . In a sense he did . But he had lost the respect of the only people whose respect he valued . He had become a joke to the intelligentsia . It has been said that no man has ever been written down by anyone except himself . That was not Walpole 's case . A far better writer with a casual , almost a left-hand gesture collapsed his reputation and self-confidence with the portrait in one book of a minor character . As Alroy Kear in Somerset Maugham 's Cakes and Ale , Walpole was presented as a literary careerist , busily grooming himself to be the G.O.M. of the English novel . His technique and tactics were explained , his motives were exposed . He was made ridiculous . From Walpole 's point of view , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Athenians wearied of hearing Aristides called the Just , and writers who were suffering the occupational hazards of a profession peculiarly subject to ups and downs had begun to be irritated by Walpole 's perpetual geniality . Need he always look as though he were the guest of honor at a party at which Life and Literature were the host and hostess ? In 1926 Beverley Nichols in his Twenty-five was amusingly malicious at his expense . After referring to his " appearance of complacency " Nichols concluded " he was born middle-aged , but he is rapidly achieving his first childhood . " Walpole was able to parry that attack . He asked Nichols to lunch and a recantation duly appeared in the Sketch . But the number of people who chuckled over that particular chapter was an indication of the way the wind was blowing . Walpole again looked too well . Actually he suffered from diabetes and had to give himself daily injections of insulin . He drank little alcohol but he had a " sweet tooth , " and to correct his indulgences in candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermined his health . Morbid streaks were detected in his work , in The Man with Red Hair particularly . He remained unmarried ; gossip did not link his name with any woman 's ; people began to wonder . " That kind of thing " was all very well for willowy young men at Broadcasting House but it was scarcely appropriate to " Apple-cheeked Hugh " and " the roast beef of old England . " It was only an affair of whispers and nothing more transpired . Such a temporary recession would have provided an effective background for an adulatory welcoming of the Herries chronicle . " In the later twenties , " so might the encomiums have read , " there were not lacking those who questioned Sir Hugh 's power to stay the course , but now incontestably the proof is here . . . . " That is how it might have been . But instead those whispers became a pedestal for the " Aunt Sally " absurdities of Alroy Kear . Cakes and Ale is one of the most damaging exposures to which any professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the complete absence of hatred , malice , and uncharitableness on its author 's part . Maugham has admitted that Cakes and Ale is the book whose writing he enjoyed the most . It is told in the first person , and " Ashenden " throughout is in the best of tempers . The atmosphere is sunny and good-natured . There is no suggestion that Maugham is trying to get his own back . He is just having fun . I T MUST be admitted that Maugham drew several red herrings across the trail . He made Kear a good golfer , which Walpole was not , he attributed his celibacy to unrequited love , and there were a number of minor points of dissimilarity . J. B. Priestley , who collaborated once with Walpole . was dining with me shortly after its publication . One of my guests , a barrister , referred to the caricature of Walpole . Priestley asked him 3vhy he assumed that it was Walpole . " Walpole would never order a lunch like that , " he said . " But who else could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point . The character was too lifelike not to have been drawn from life ; too much in it rang true ; too much could he confirmed ; too many aging novelists recalled the flattering tributes to their work from a young writer , which were followed a few months after by the advance copy of a novel graciously inscribed " from a pupil to a master " ; too many reviewers who had written in a lukewarm way about Walpole 's work had received , if not invitations to lunch , at least long letters expressing gratitude for the review , interest in the criticisms made , and a resolve to profit at a next endeavor ; too many literary " punters " had noted how his apparently disinterested concern for his fellow writers ? his letter to the Times Literary Supplement about first novels for example ? had in fact provided Walpole with much publicity without particularly benefiting the objects of his concern . There were red herrings . But by and large they made the situation worse . Where so many traits could he recognized , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anthony West , reviewing Rupert Hart Davies ' biography , was to write ( twenty-two years later ) in the New Yorker : " Everything was there ; the appealing charm that Walpole could lavish on those who were successful and might be useful , and the bland indifference with which he could treat old friends who had betrayed him by being neither , and most unkind of all his almost complete lack of talent . " That is most unfair . Alroy Kear was based on Walpole but was not completely Walpole . It is not true that Walpole dropped old friends who had ceased to be successful . He was on the contrary generous with loans of money , and many writers now established stand in his debt for kindness and encouragement . Nor was he by any means without talent . He had indeed most of the secondary qualities of a major novelist . He was industrious and ambitious . His novels had both theme and plot . He was not afraid of melodrama . He could evoke curiosity and maintain suspense . He could build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he so enjoyed telling a story , he was so excited by what he had to tell , that the reader became anxious about the outcome and was sufficiently held not to be worried by the flatness of the actual writing . Alroy Kear is a composite caricature , and a cruel but genuine portrait with " every pimple in " would have clone less damage . Cakes and Ale ruined the last ten years of Walpole 's life . T HE story has been told that he began to read it while he was changing for din- ner , as a guest in a country house . He had propped the book on the mantelpiece . Kear opens the story and before Walpole had read ten pages he had identified himself . In fascinated horror he read on ; he forgot his dressing , he forgot dinner , he went on reading . When his host finally came up to see if anything was wrong he found Walpole ' standing before the mantelpiece , his shirt-tails flapping about his knees and his imbraced trousers in a coil round his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diary is less dramatic , but it was the embroidered story that went the rounds . ? " How was Hugh taking it ? " Everyone was asking that , and Edward Knoblock was reported to have earned a diploma for tact for having asked at a lunch party in Walpole 's company whether it was " really necessary for Willie to have written quite so cruelly about poor John Drinkwater . " How was he taking it ? How should he take it ? The worst human misfortune had befallen him . He had been made to look an ass : and the particular form of careerism of which he had been convicted was the very one his fellow writers would be the least likely to condone . Writers respect a colleague who works for fame ; the pursuit of money is venial not venal , but to write to become " a person of importance " is not for an author an honorable objective . That is a goal for politicians . How was he taking it ? There was nothing he could do . Cakes and Ale could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a lunch talk . The days of dueling are past . He could not have assaulted in public a man ten years his senior and six inches shorter . He could not have addressed a letter to the Times . Ninety-nine times in a hundred it is wise to ignore attack ; Walpole in that respect was wise . Unfortunately he overdid it . He not only behaved as though nothing had happened , but went out of his way to insist that nothing had happened . A year later Elinor Mordaunt published anonymously a novel of which Maugham was undisguisedly the central character . It was called Gin and Bitters in America , and Full Circle in England . Maugham brought an action against the book in the English courts and obtained its suppression . On the book 's appearance in:America , Walpole attacked it violently . The book was published there by Farrar and Rinehart , and for many years there hung in the firm 's office a cartoon by Will Dyson entitled " The Noble Art of Self-defense . " It showed a small frail woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assault of a man twice her size . Her assailant is unmistakably Hugh Walpole . The book in her hand is Gin and Bitters and the caption reads , " Now no one can say that Cakes and Ale was meant for me . " The caricature of Walpole is lethally vindictive . The name of Dyson may not convey much today . The reputation of a political cartoonist is fugitive . But his gift was great and individual . He worked for the extreme left wing , and no one could have rendered more bestial the profiteers of the first war and the moneyed worldings of the twenties . He drew them half animal , half human , sometimes as pigs in over-tight morning coats and over-tall top hats , their fingers dripping blood that became gold sovereigns as they reached their moneybags . It was with that technique that he drew Walpole . He posed him in a Rupert Brooke style open shirt posturing as the incarnation of careless youth ; but you saw at once that he was middle-aged ; there was a glandular obscenity about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were long , pointed , pudgy , the fingers of a decadent . It exposed a basic unwholesomeness underlying a spurious healthiness : The Man with the Red Hair showing beneath Fortitude . It was hard to look at Walpole afterward without remembering that cartoon . I HAVE been told that it was only by degrees that Walpole realized how much damage the hook had done him . Ninety-nine times in a hundred if you ignore attack , the thing blows over , but Cakes and Ale would not blow over . It was too good a book ; as long as it was being read , and there seemed no likelihood of its not being read during his lifetime , he would look an ass . And it became in time apparent that he had make a mistake in letting himself still he numbered among Maugham 's acquaintances . Late in the thirties Maugham gave a large supper party at Claridge 's in honor of his granddaughter 's birth . There must have been a hundred and fifty people there . There was no fixed seating ; there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the guests were connected in some way with the arts , and the grandchild 's health was proposed by Osbert Sitwell . Walpole was in any gathering , because of his height and chin , a conspicuous figure , and there was a whispered " Fancy him being here , " as he moved from one table to another . It was felt that he would have shown dignity had he stayed away . his knighthood did his reputation little good . For no good reason , a knighthood has less prestige value for a novelist or poet than it has for an actor or a painter , a critic or a historian . The best novelists and poets have not been knighted and Galsworthy declined a knighthood . It was perhaps this reluctance of the novelist and poet to he addressed as Sir Francis or Sir George that encouraged Edward VII to institute the Order of Merit . When Walpole 's name appeared in the Honors List , people said , " Ah , it 's a consolation prize for Cakes and Ale . " Walpole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware of this . But he felt he would " like to be a knight . " During the last months before the war he contributed a critical causerie to the Daily Sketch , a paper now amalgamated with the Graphic , that had no literary standing . One wondered why he accepted the assignment . He could not have needed the money , and it must have been boring to wade through mediocre books . Did he want to feel somebody of consequence ? At the end of the twenties Arnold Bennett had written a weekly article on books for the Evening Standard . But that had been a different matter . The Evening Standard was an important and influential paper . It had given Bennett a pulpit . And Bennett had enjoyed a sense of day-to-day eventfulness . He had felt in the swim . He " made " several books , Jew Siiss in particular , and every writer was anxious to he reviewed by him . But the Sketch could not do that for Walpole . As the nineteen-thirties moved to their shadowed close , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the result possibly of a sense of guilt on their part , the realization that they had been unjust to him . It would be idle to pretend that most of us had not taken a malicious pleasure in his discomfiture . The Malvolio motif is an unfailing formula , it is human to be jealous of success , and Cakes and Ale had been very funny . But all the same we recognized that he had been unfairly treated . We resented his having given us the sense of guilt . IN THE spring of 1939 he was sent to Rome by the Herald Tribune to report the coronation of the Pope . In The Roman Fountain he used this trip as the framework for a variety of digressions . It is one of his better books , but it was published after the war had started and it contained much with which at such a time it was hard not to feel impatient . He wrote gratefully of the kindnesses he had received from Somerset Maugham when he was a young man in London . Why , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He explained that he had given a false impression of complacency when he was young by holding up his prominent chin to keep his pince-nez in position . It seemed childish that he would be worrying about that at this late day . He described his loneliness in a hotel bedroom on his first night in Rome . It was a self-pitying passage . " Really , " one thought , " what is he fussing about now , living in a comfortable hotel as the Tribune 's guest with a large check awaiting him at the end ! " He went on to wonder whether in such a hotel he might not one night feel the first symptoms of a mortal malady . A morbid passage . But , as I said , one was unfair to Walpole . Perhaps he did have a premonition then . At any rate , two years later he was dead . He died in June 1941 , when nerves were strained . For a year England had been carrying on a war single-handed . Russia had not yet been invaded , America seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombing . Defeat was following defeat , in the Balkans , . Greece , and Crete ; the brief gains in the desert had been mostly lost . It was easy at such a time to snap . But making allowance for the temper of the moment , his obituary notices were astonishingly malevolent ; they gave the impression that their authors had been smoldering for years with irritation , that they had not wanted to say what they felt during his lifetime because " after all the old boy was likable and they were sorry for him , " but that now they could not wait to get it off their chests . Nothing could have surprised me more at Christmas 1918 than to have been told that in 1941 I should be reading such obituaries . Maugham has said more than once that a man who has done you a bad turn never forgives you for it , and it would seem that he has not forgiven Walpole the injury he did him . In A Writer 's Notebook he compares him with Charles Garvice , unfavorably in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garvice may have sold more copies of his books , but Walpole must have made very much more money than Garvice did . And in his preface to the American edition of Cakes and Ale which was printed on the front page of the Sunday book section of the New York Times , he identified Walpole as the Original of Ahoy Kear , describing him as a man whom you could like but could not respect , dismissing his work as negligible . The nail in the coffin . Rupert Hart Davies quoted'in his biography , in particular reference to the Times obituary notice , the concluding sentence of Charles Morgan 's section on Walpole in The House of Macmillan : " So good a storyteller is likely at any rate to live longer than many a petit maitre who sneered at him as soon as he was dead . " But with the driving of that nail home , it is probable that more and more readers will join Anthony West in a complete identification of Ahoy Kear with Walpole , and that Walpole will be recalled not as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the world 's best light novels . Literary history contains few episodes as ironic .
