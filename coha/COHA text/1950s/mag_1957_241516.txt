The teacher produced a pair of long leather thongs . " These are tefillin , or phylacteries , " she said . " They are wrapped around the left arm and the forehead during prayer . And this is a tallith , a prayer shawl . " <P> " Why does n't my Dad ever wear them ? " asked a black-eyed twelve-year-old in the Jerusalem classroom . <P> " Because your Dad is n't religious , " the teacher answered . <P> " Then I 'm not either , " snapped the boy , " and I do n't want to learn about the silly things . " <P> All over Israel last week students in government-run secular schools were reacting with anger or , curiosity or boredom to a new course of teaching that would have shocked their Zionist forebears on the one hand and their Diaspora ancestors on the other . Orthodox Jews would have been horrified at the thought of a child growing up in Israel without knowing the words of a single prayer or the uses of candles on the Sabbath . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have exposed their children to religious rites , which they viewed as symbols of the ghetto . <P> Religion = Submission ? First-generation Zionists refused to look on the Bible as anything but a history of the Jewish people-a group of the left-wing Mapam movement even bowdlerized the Bible of any reference to God and tried unsuccessfully to promote its use on collective farms . But recently even the most determined agnostics began to feel that this spiritual decontamination policy had gone too far . Young people were contemptuously ignorant of all Jewish tradition and looked down on everything that happened before the turn of the century as belonging to a " submissive people . " Explains Headmaster Zebulun Tuchman of Jerusalem 's largest school , the Rehavia Gymnasium : " Children who reached school age after the creation of Israel had no interest in the Jewish past , in Jewish literature , in Jewish religion . " At the Youth Congress in Moscow last summer , Israeli delegates were embarrassed before their fellow Jews at a Sabbath service when the youngster called up to read the week 's passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expected to do . <P> There have been signs that young Israel is beginning to feel some concern at its own religious rootlessness . Newspapers commented on the number of children at the High Holy Day services this year asking their fathers questions about the ritual . When two newspapers offered copies of the Talmud to subscribers at 25% discount , they were flooded with orders from parents whose children were badgering them for a copy of the Jewish Bible . <P> Religion = Nationalism ? The new government program carefully avoids the word " religious . " In its pamphlet distributed to teachers last week , the Ministry of Education refers to learning about Talmud and Torah , tallith and tefillin as " inspiration from the glorious past of the Jewish nation . " This sedulously secular approach , many teachers in religious schools think , dooms the program from the start . Said one teacher : " Sacred matters are being treated as if they were small change . The children will be confused and unimpressed. "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
