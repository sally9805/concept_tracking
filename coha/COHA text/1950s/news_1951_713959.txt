txt GUARANTEE SOUGHT Britain , France and Other Allies Asked to Aid in Defining Situation ACHESON IS STILL WARY But He Sees Military Goals Met if Enemy Withdraws Behind 38th Parallel By JAMES RESTON Special tO THE NEW YORK TIMES . WASHINGTON , June 26 ? The United States has instructed Ambassador Alan G. Kirk in Moscow to ask the Soviet Government for clarification on its cease-fire proposal for Korea . It has also sought the assistance of the British , the French and one or two other governments in finding out precisely what the Soviet Union meant by the address of Jacob A. Malik , Soviet delegate to the United Nations , in New York last Saturday . Though he remained extremely cautious , Secretary of State Dean Acheson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee today that while it would be a mistake to regard the Malik speech as a sign of any change in the purposes of the Soviet Union , it could , he added , represent a sincere desire to end the fighting in Korea . " We are now trying to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the Malik speech does mean , " Mr. Acheson said . Later tonight , it was learned , that not only Ambassador Kirk in Moscow , but United States representatives at the United Nations in New York had been authorized to explore the Soviet proposals directly with the Russians . U. S. Aims Defined Anew Testifying on the Administration 's foreign aid bill , the Secretary of State also redefined the political and military aims of the United States . The military objective of the United States , the Secretary said , would be satisfied if the Communists withdrew behind the Thirtyeighth Parallel and gave satisfactory guarantees against a revival of the aggression . " What we have been doing in Korea is to repel aggression and restore peace and security to the area , " he testified during the hearings on the foreign aid bill . " If this aggression is stopped , and with guarantees that it will not be resumed , then you will have repelled aggression and restored peace in the area . " Mr. Acheson added that our political purpose in Korea ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain , but what the American troops went into Korea to do , he asserted , was not to unify Korea but to stop the aggressors and restore peace and security in the area . He did not define the Government 's idea of what satisfactory guarantees against a revival of aggression would entail . Nor did he outline his conception of peace and security in " the area of Korea . " In answer to questions , however , he observed that the withdrawal of the Communists behind the Thirtyeighth Parallel with guarantees against a revival of their aggression could be considered " a successful conclusion of the conflict . " New Context for Statement The only thing new about these statements was that they were made after the Malik speech of last Saturday . The distinction be . tween United States military objectives in Korea and American political objectives was reached several weeks ago in a meeting of the National Security Council . It was carefully defined by Mr. Acheson during his testimony before the inquiry , and it should be read in context with another statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was a memorandum , not intended for publication , which was inadvertently made public in Tokyo today . In it , the State Department made these points , among others : 1 . The Soviet peace proposal " might have been a cover for military advantage , " to place Conlkinned on Page 4 , Column U. S. to Request Soviet to Clarify Proposal to Effect a Truce in Korea // the enemy h. a better position on the battlefield. 2 . The problem of a cease-fire is too complicated merely to accept a withdrawal at the Thirtyeighth Parallel . 3 . The idea of a demilitarized zone between the forces in Korea had some merit , " but not necessarily a withdrawal from Parallel 38 . ; ' In short , the Administration is examining the Malik proposals with extreme care , and not only with a view to ending the fighting , but With the idea of negotiating arrangements under which the fighting can not easily be revived . It is the official view here , at least for the present , that machinery would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carefully policed , preferably by the United Nations , and preferably with a view to furthering , rather than defeating , the long-range political objective of achieving a unified and democratic Korea . With these things in mind , some doubt is being expressed here on the proposal of negotiating the settlement at the Thirty-eighth Parallel , which is a line on a map , rather than an area that can easily be defended . The Administration has accepted the idea of not fighting on the field of battle for its political objective of a unified Korea , and if the Russians  --  and the Chinese Communists  --  are likewise willing to limit their objectives and abandon the policy of trying to drive the United Nations armies out of Korea , then the United States sees the possibility of a negotiated settlement . The United States wants any such settlement to depend on more than the pledged word of the Communists , however . Specifically , if the country is to be divided , the ' united States would like to see it divided along a line that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the last forty-eight hours , State Department officials here have been going over these questions with the military and with allied representatives . Only from the South Koreans have they run into major opposition on their policy of negotiating a settlement on the basis outlined by Mr. Acheson . Sae Sun Kim , Counselor of the Korean Embassy , and Pyo Wook Han , First Secretary of that embassy , called on Assistant Secretary of State Dean Rusk yesterday and expressed the most adamant , and even bitter opposition to the whole idea of negotiating a settlement short of unification of the whole country . They also insisted upon representation in the Rusk committee , which was originally established to give Mr. Rusk an opportunity to explain the military situation to the representatives of all the United Nations having troops fighting in Korea . Now that this committee is got , . ing over possible terms of peace , however , the Korean representatives insisted that their country be represented at least as observers , even though South Korea was not a member of the United Nations . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently in general agreement with the State Department 's approach . One or two of them counseled the United States against " overdoing the skepticism , " but as far as one could learn , they were generally in agreement on the following propo-sitions : 1 . The Malik proposals were propaganda , but they were also more than propaganda . 2 . The Soviet Union had reached the conclusion that the United Nations forces could not be driven off the Korean Peninsula , without committing to the battle more war materiel than the Soviet Union was willing to deliver . 3 . The hearings on the dismissal  --  the text of which was cabled by Tess to Moscow for part of the hearings  --  had demonstrated that pressure was building up here for extending the war to Manchuria . 4 . The situation , therefore , was more of a threat to the Soviet position in the Far East than Moscow liked and the war was encouraging Western rearmament and Western air bases around the Soviet Union . 5 . Therefore , it was to the advantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get American power away from the Soviet Far Eastern frontiers , and return ? Korea to the status quo in which Moscow would have a good chance of achieving control of the whole peninsula by political infiltration . Most of this , of course , is admittedly pure guesswork about Soviet intentions , but at least the diplomats engaged in the talks seem to have given more weight to these speculations than to the theory that Mr. Malik was merely whooping up the Communist peace campaign . A meeting of all allied nations having troops in Korea , except the South Koreans , will be held at the State Department tomorrow . Designs on Iran Feared ' WASHINGTON , June 26 ( 1P ) ? Secretary Acheson told Congressmen today that the cease-fire pro ' posal by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Malik might be " camouflage " to mask Soviet designs in oil-rich Iran in the Near East and Burma in the Far East . Both are potential powder kegs in the troubled world situation .               @ @ @ @ @ @
