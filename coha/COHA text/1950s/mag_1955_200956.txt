A NEW HANDBOOK ON HANGING ( 179 pp. ) - Charles Duff-Regnery ( $3.50 ) . <P> " It has been and still is a matter of opinion , " writes British Author Charles Duff , " whether , if you wish to kill your undesirable , it is better to ... flay him until he dies , or hurl him over a precipice ; or burn him or drown or suffocate him ; or entomb him alive ... or asphyxiate him in a lethal chamber , or press him to death or cut off his head ; or produce a sort of coma by means of an electric current ... For my own part ... I have reached the conclusion - that no people can point to a method which is more beautiful and expeditious , or which is aesthetically superior to the time-honoured British practice of breaking their necks by hanging ... " <P> Philosopher &; Friend . Author Duff ( who holds a law degree ) argues that the public should be admitted to hangings , as it was in England until 1868 , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient and symbolical ritual . " By selling film rights to hangings , the master executioners could be rewarded with more than their present fee ( about $44 a knot ) . Moreover , says Duff , hangings should be broadcast for their highly dramatic sound effects , such as " the crack like a muffled shot of a small pistol which indicates the official breaking of the criminal 's neck . " <P> Hangmen , pleads Author Duff , are widely underrated : they are really artists . The good hangman must not only have a sharp eye and a clever touch ; he must have personality and good stage presence , must feel at home with any class of people , and should be " capable of being the guide , philosopher and friend of whomsoever he must hang for us . " In particular , Duff sings the praises of 19th century Hangman James Berry , who calculated precisely the length of rope needed to break the prisoner 's neck with pulling the head off . Berry expressed this in a brilliant and still widely used equation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> 412 = lenghth of drop weitht of the body in feet in stones <P> It may take the reader of this chilling little volume a while to catch on to the fact that Author Duff is not really writing in praise of hanging . He has , in fact , produced a devastating Swiftian satire against capital punishment . <P> Hemp Is Best . When the book first appeared in England in 1928 , it started a storm of controversy , and a Royal Commission later recommended that the death penalty be abolished . After barely failing to vote a temporary end to capital punishent in 1948 , Parliament may now debate the matter again , and Author Duff has brought his satire up to date with the latest technical information , plus international statistics . Though about half the nations of the U.N . have abandoned capital punishment , Britain , the Commonwealth and the " more enlightened states " of the U.S. " continue to hang .
