1 INT . ISOLATION WARD AT A SAN FRANCISCO HOSPITAL - DUSK FADE IN CLOSE SHOT - INTO the mirror of an iron lung , where we see the reflection of a pale but prettily curly-headed six-year old girl . As the shot proceeds , CAMERA IS CHANGING ANGLE so that Dr. Jeff Cameron is also seen in reflection . Jeff is tall , lanky ; amused grey eyes , a quick ironic smile . He wears a surgical mask , and he is telling a " bedtime " story as he leans against the drum behind the child 's head , looking down toward the reflection of her eagerly interested eyes . His voice is very kind . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON . . . And there was Little Elmer the Elephant , with all those wild men chasing him all over the jungle , with guns booming at him , and tanks rumbling after him , and airplanes dive-bombing him from overhead . It was a tricky situation , because the only escape was across the big wide river  --  CAMERA HAS CONTINUED TO PULL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a screen in the children 's isolation ward , which has some dozen or so beds , with varied children of from five years to fourteen . Annie , a motherly old nurse who also wears a mask , approaches , bringing a progress chart , as Jeff continues . . .  --  3  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( cont 'd )  --  and the river was all flooded by the heavy rains  --  like the rain we had last week  --  and Elmer the Elephant knew that if he tried to swim he 'd be washed away over the big waterfall , which was as high as the bridges we have right here in San Francisco . It looked pretty bad for Little Elmer so  --  &nbsp; ANNIE ( THE NURSE ) ( breaking in low ) Do n't excite her too much , Doctor . Jeff glances at the old nurse - then looks down again . . . only to grin pleasantly and say , sotto voce - &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONExcite her ? She 's asleep . 2 CLOSE ANGLE showing that the baby girl has dropped peacefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . &nbsp; ANNIEOh. . . that 's wonderful . Poor little mite has n't slept since three this morning . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( with dry humor ) So much for little Elmer the Elephant . ( turning away , glancing at chart ) Well . . . I guess he 'd have been drowned anyway . . . They have come out through the screens and are walking along the line of beds , CAMERA TRUCKING BEFORE them . Old Annie says with crotchety solicitude - &nbsp; ANNIEYou 'd better tell yourself a bedtime story , Doctor . It 's all very well , working fifteen hours on end but  --   --  4  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( as they walk ) Annie , stop bullying me  --  &nbsp; ANNIE ( continuing )  --  if you do n't sleep straight through the weekend , I 'll  --  But Jeff has suddenly turned to a bed , taking the pulse of an obviously very ill boy of around ten , who looks up at him with a dog-like devotion . Jeff is saying - &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONWell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  How 's the pulse ?  --  &nbsp; BOY ( weakly ) Hello , Doc ! &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( of the pulse ) Fine . . . ticking like a clock . ( looking up at Annie ) Better check him out , nurse . . . he 's here under false pretenses . . . But the boy says - with an air of personal aggrievement- &nbsp; BOYAnnie says you 're goin ' away . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( cheerfully ) Sure I 'm going away . You do n't expect me to stay here all night , do you ? &nbsp; BOYAnnie says you 're goin ' away f'r good . . . &nbsp; ANNIE ( explaining quickly ) I  --  told him you were leaving the hospital , Doctor . . . to go into private practice .  --  5  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONOh  --  that ! ( to the boy ) I 'm not leaving for two weeks  --  the way you 're coming along you 'll be out of here before I will . &nbsp; BOY ( grinning weakly ) Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( reassuringly ) Any time you like , Dick . . . and we 'll have a good old bull session about the Dodgers and the Yankees . ( rising , as he pats the boy 's hair ) Be seeing you . . . But even in the act of going to the door at the end of the ward , Jeff has seen - 3 ANGLE TOWARD slit window of door - Julie . Seen through the little door window , also wearing a mask , is Julie Dorn . Julie 's figure and hair suggest a neat and nice person . Her eyes are clear and direct . . . but never at any time in the story do we actually see her face . She has recognized Jeff through the window ; her eyes register momentary discomfort . 4 CLOSE SHOT TOWARD Jeff . We are conscious of his discomfort too ; this is a meeting which he would rather have avoided . But he opens the door ; Julie enters in f.g. , back to camera . Jeff says , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Julie ! Julie hesitates ; her voice is always attractively cool , although at this moment it does n't entirely conceal her embarrassment . . .  --  6  --  &nbsp; JULIEGood evening , Doctor . . . ( as Jeff pauses ) It 's  --  been a beautiful day . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON . . . Lovely , Julie . &nbsp; ANNIE ( accusingly ) Not that he 'd know . . . working until he drops . . . Annie 's interjection has broken the slight tension . Jeff grins . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONAll I 've done is talk your Katie Cartwright into a sound sleep . &nbsp; JULIE ( with immediate pleasure ) Ohhh . . . I 'm so glad . She needed it . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( grinning at Annie who starts to speak ) I know , Annie  --  so do I. . .

HOSPITAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff closes the door behind him . He takes off his mask and for the first time we see his clean-cut features .

A hospital attendant , in the emergency door beyond which we can see a waiting ambulance , shouts - &nbsp; ATTENDANTI got you a wagon ride , Doc , but they ca n't wait !

SHOT - just within the door of the dimly-lit restaurant , full of blue smoke and the strains of Hawaiian music . Jeff enters eagerly , pausing beside a counter where a lovely Hawaiian girl is selling flowers , leis , etc .. The girl smiles with immediate recognition . . . &nbsp; HAWAIIAN GIRLGood evening , sir . The usual ? It 's all ready . As she speaks she profers a red rose in a cellophane box . Jeff grins.  --  11  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONYou 're catching on . &nbsp; HAWAIIAN GIRL ( nodding toward terrace ) I think the young lady 's already here , sir . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONSo soon . . . He has passed money ; he grabs the rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANGLE as Jeff comes to a recessed and shadowy booth on the terrace ; the velvet bay and the glistening lights of San Francisco can be seen through the big windows beyond . Jeff immediately slips into the seat beside Margo , very close , seizing her hands . Margo is an exquisite bundle of fur , dainty and desirable , with a lovely , almost too sensitive face which can never quite cloak her emotions . Sometimes her cheeks pucker ; the unconcealed quickness to laughter or tears of a child . The darkness of this corner makes it possible for the love scene to be demonstrative without attracting attention . These two are obviously very much in love . Jeff just breathes the name - &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONMargo  --  Then he has drawn her to him , his arms go strongly around her , their lips meet in a long kiss ; her mink coat falls away as she clings hungrily to him . . . But after a while he draws back slightly , says almost guiltily - &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( cont 'd ) You 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  &nbsp; MARGO ( breaking in - soft - and as frank as a child ) I came early . . . to have the Specials all ready and waiting . . .  --  12  --  She has indicated two drinks on the table before them . . . the Beachbombers , " cocoanut-shell " type of beverage . Jeff drinks . But Margo has already seen the rose in the cellophane box . Her hand darts to it ; we recognize that her movements are frequently too quick  --  an attractive restlessness which Jeff adores , considering it to be the impulsiveness of a young woman truly in love . Margo is saying - &nbsp; MARGO ( cont 'd ) You never forget the rose . ( sudden and warm ) Oh , Jeff , say you love me . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( close ) You know it . &nbsp; MARGO ( smiling ) But you 're bad for me . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONNo ! . . . Why ? &nbsp; MARGO ( quick , impulsive ) We 've known each other  --  just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( clinging close to him ) But when you 're not with me , I feel like I 'm suspended in mid-air . . . with nothing down beneath except the . . . end of the world . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONThink I do n't feel the same way ? &nbsp; MARGOI love you so . . . He bends close again ; her cheek goes against his , almost ecstatic . But suddenly -  --  13  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONYou cheek 's burning  --  Margo brings her face from his . Jeff looks at her for a flash  --  then takes both her elbows in his hands . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( cont 'd ) Hey  --  young woman , you 're a bundle of nerves ! &nbsp; MARGOI 'm all right . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONAs your doctor  --  &nbsp; MARGO ( breaking in ) Do n't be my doctor  --  not tonight . Dance music has started . Suddenly Margo comes to her feet , indicating with her hands for him to join her in a dance . Jeff grins and rises .

POGO PETE 'S TERRACE - NIGHT CLOSE MOVING SHOT - on Jeff and Margo , as they dance . Margo says with a sigh of content - &nbsp; MARGOHold me tight  --  so tight I ca n't get away from you . . .  --  14  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONYou 're not going to get away from me . You 'll never get away from me . . . Margo sighs happily . His lips brush her cheek . . . then , very close to her - &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( cont 'd ) I 'm  --  going crazy . . . living in a sort of dream . All day long . . . all I want . . . all I think of is you . . . like this . . . and in my arms . . . The MUSIC stops . They stop dancing . The spell is broken . Margo gives a sudden little shake to her head , asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( drawing her back to the table ) What 's the difference ? . . . Let 's have three more for the road . . &nbsp; MARGOBut , Jeff , I 'm  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( sitting , finishing sentence )  --  then we 'll get out of here . Margo sits too , close to him . She glances at him as - &nbsp; MARGOI 've got to get out of here now . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONRelax . Finish these and I 'm ready  --  &nbsp; MARGO ( jerkily , curiously ) But , Jeff  --  I have n't told you . Tonight 's different  --  this is n't going to be like  --  ( as his cheek turns in surprise ) I 'm going away .  --  15  --  Jeff literally recoils . After a moment - &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONYou 're kidding . &nbsp; MARGO ( shaking her head ) I 'm going tonight . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( staring ) For what ? &nbsp; MARGOA trip . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( slowly ) Say that again . Where ? &nbsp; MARGO ( quietly ) To Nassau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You . . . Where did you get this bright idea ? What about me ? &nbsp; MARGO ( playing with the rose box ) It was n't my idea . Father came back today from Vancouver . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( quickly ) Did n't you tell him about us ? &nbsp; MARGO ( nodding ) The answer was Nassau  --  tonight . I only got out by saying I had to pick up some last-minute things at the drugstore . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONYou 're a grown woman . . .  --  16  --  &nbsp; MARGOWithout a penny if he says so . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( decisively ) Okay , I want you , not your money . . . and if you love me you 'll think the same way I do . . . &nbsp; MARGOThe money would help . It can be tough for a young doctor . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONI 've aged considerably in the last five minutes . . . &nbsp; MARGO ( feelingly ) Jeff , poverty 's sordid . If you were broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what do you know about poverty ? &nbsp; MARGOEnough to know you ca n't mix it with a career . . . and loving your work the way you do  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( breaking in ) Listen  --  &nbsp; MARGO ( going straight on ) No , Jeff , you 're just beginning . . . your heart and your life 's in what you 're doing . I know what you want  --  how you feel about helping people . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( breaking in roughly ) I want you ! ( cutting in as she goes to protest ) All right , so I started with  --  17  --  nothing . . . who cares ? We 'll make out , without your father . We 'll fight it out together . . . &nbsp; MARGO ( breaking in appealingly ) But do n't ever fight me  --  not me , Jeff  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( holding her hands firmly ) If you 're going any place , you 're going with me ! &nbsp; MARGO ( close , moved ) Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Let it work out  --  you know what I mean  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONI do n't know what you mean . I only know I wo n't let you go ! Tears are on Margo 's cheeks . At last , softly - &nbsp; MARGOYou 're right  --  of course you 're right . . . ( nodding , as if forcing a decision ) Jeff , I 'll talk to him again  --  I 'll talk tonight  --  I 've got to . Please understand . ( cont 'd )  --  18  --  &nbsp; MARGO ( cont 'd ) I 'll call you at the hospital . . .

Suddenly his face is buried in hers , a desperate kiss of love and passion and desire ; CAMERA IS VERY CLOSE .

She lets him hold it for a moment  --  then she leaves shot in f.g .  --  their fingers linger together till the last moment . 17 LONG SHOT FROM Jeff 's ANGLE , as Margo goes across the room . She stops near the door , looks back indecisively . The restless hunger is in her face . But she gots hold of herself and goes out . 18 MED . SHOT Jeff , looking after her .

He half rises . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONHey  --  But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; WAITERWant the check , sir ? Jeff sits again .

The waiter shakes his head . &nbsp; WAITERWell  --  yours , sir , but  --  hope you had a big dinner . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONNothing since breakfast . &nbsp; WAITERThat 's bad . That drink makes a guy talk back to his mother-in-law . The drink is still at Jeff 's lip . Suddenly he stops drinking , looks over the glass . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONOr his father-in-law , huh ?

THE LANNINGTON HOME - NIGHT LONG PANNING SHOT - WITH a taxi , which comes up the winding drive to the front door of the highly sumptuous Lannington house , on a hill overlooking the Golden Gate . As the taxi stops - 20 CLOSE ANGLE beside the taxi , as Jeff descends , rather unsteadily . He passes a bill to the taxi driver .  --  20  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( thick-tongued ) Hot night , huh ? &nbsp; TAXI DRIVER ( pockets bill ) Thanks . . . ( as he sees Jeff sway slightly ) You okay , Bub ? &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONThe doctor 's as well as can be expected . . . The taxi drives on . Jeff looks up at the house ; the cellophane box is under his arm . Then he goes up the steps , definitely unsteady , CAMERA ANGLING WITH him . He RINGS the bell , waits . A " mew " is heard . Jeff looks down to see a Siamese cat , which rubs itself against his legs . He grins rather foolishly . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitty . . . remember me ? . . .

Jeff holds out the box with an unsteady bow . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONThis week , Madam , we are offering a special bonus , a red rose , for each new subscription to The Medical Journal  --  &nbsp; MARGO ( tingling with nerves ) For heaven 's sake  --  Suddenly Margo is close , speaking desperately and low . &nbsp; MARGO --  Jeff - you 've had too much to drink !  --  21  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERON ( thickly ) Three Specials  --  th ' drink that makes ' em talk back to pappy-in-law  --  ( moving as if to pass her ) Tha 's what I 'm going to do . . . &nbsp; MARGO ( seizing his arm ) No  --  please  --  you must n't !

His quick eyes flash to Margo . For the moment she is still as a statue - then her hand comes up vaguely to brush a hair from her brow . Lannington smiles thinly . . . &nbsp; LANNINGTONWe 'll explore that remark over a drink . . . ( casually , crossing to cabinet bar ) And where did you two meet  --  at the drug store tonight ? Jeff raises his head , unsteady but determinedly assertive . . . &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONBeen seeing each other for three weeks . . . &nbsp; LANNINGTON ( who has stopped , bottle in hand - then - ) Highball ? . . .

In stepping forward to take the highball , Jeff has nearly stumbled over one of three or four suitcases . Lannington politely removes the offending article . &nbsp; LANNINGTON ( cont 'd ) Let 's put that out of your way .

Jeff mutters.  --  26  --  &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONYour  --  wife . . . &nbsp; LANNINGTONYes , Doctor . Oh , I admit the conspicuous difference in our ages . Margo married me for my money  --  I married her for her youth . We both got what we wanted  --  after a fashion . For a long , long moment Jeff is gazing at Lannington. . . then he suddenly turns , stumbles almost blindly toward the door .

You do n't know what he 's like  --  a mad dog  --  But the door has SLAMMED in her face - Jeff has gone . For a moment she is standing , desperate - then she faces Lannington , quivering with tension - &nbsp; MARGO ( cont 'd ) Look what you 've done  --  ruined my chance of happiness . .

Past his shoulder we see that Margo is on her knees , reaching for one of her earrings on the carpet . Her ear lobe is bleeding . Lannington faces her , a lividly cold smile on his lips . The girl gasps to Jeff - &nbsp; MARGOHe tore it  --  tore the earring from my ear  --  ( as she sees blood on her fingers ) Oh  --  bleeding  --  Jeff has stepped forward into the library , CAMERA FOLLOWING as he catches Margo to her feet , saying to Lannington - &nbsp; JEFF CAMERONYou must be crazy !

Lannington staggers back , crunches against the fireplace again , then slides almost ludicrously to the hearthrug . AT THE SAME MOMENT , as if from the final blow and in Jeff 's mind , we are conscious of a HEAVY , ECHOING THROBBING . From this moment on until indicated , the THROBBING , or the equally terrifying ECHO OF SPOKEN WORDS , is never absent from the action . Now Jeff sways forward , looking down at Lannington , who is very still .
