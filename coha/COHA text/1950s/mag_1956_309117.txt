Austria , after 17 years of occupation ( first by the Nazis , then by the Four Powers ) , has been free a year , and reveling in prosperity . Even its politics reflects contentment : for ten years the People 's Party of Chancellor Julius Raab and its principal opponents , the Socialists , have shared a happy but energetically disputatious coalition government . <P> In February the partners fell out over the rich oilfields and 291 other industries that the Russians returned when they left Austria . The Socialists wanted to nationalize them 100% ( Austria , with only one-third of its industry remaining in private hands , is perhaps the most nationalized nation outside the Iron Curtain ) . The People 's Party proposed that new enterprises should be 51% government-owned , with the public allowed to buy shares in the other 49% . The partners agreed to take their differences to the polls . <P> On Election Day a remarkable 96% of the eligible voters , mellowed by warm spring sunshine and batches of Heurigen ( new wine ) , went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a gain of eight Parliament seats-to 82-for Chancellor Raab 's party , an increase in Socialist seats from 73 to 74 . Both parties gained at the expense of the far right and left ( Communist groups polled only 4.4% of the vote ) , but the victory of Raab 's party presaged a slowdown in Austria 's headlong nationalization.
