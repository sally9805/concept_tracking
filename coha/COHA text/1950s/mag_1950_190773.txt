The veto in the U.N . Security Council was not exclusively a Russian invention . The U.S. Senate itself would not have ratified the U.N . Charter in 1945 if the veto had been omitted . Last week the U.S. and six other nations ( Canada , France , Philippines , Turkey , United Kingdom , Uruguay ) submitted to the U.N . General Assembly a plan to bypass the sacred veto . No event in U.N . ' s history-not even the decision to defend Korea-had more significance . The new proposal , well received by most of the delegations , meant that even the great powers ( Russia excepted ) were now willing to submit to the will of the majority on the vital questions of war &; peace . <P> The change in U.S. attitude had been produced mainly by Russian abuse of the veto . On 46 occasions the U.S.S.R. had demonstrated that the Security Council was helpless . The Korean decision itself was made possible by a fluke ; the Russians who had taken a walk probably would never again repeat their blunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what U.N . could do if freed from the veto . That lesson mobilized support for the new bypassing proposals . These include : <P> 1 ) If a veto prevented the Security Council from acting against aggression , the General Assembly could be called into special session on 24 hours ' notice . <P> 2 ) The Assembly would set up a Peace Observation Commission to report on danger of aggression . The Commission would need the consent of the threatened nation before sending in its representatives . <P> 3 ) Member nations would be asked to train part of their armed forces so that they could be fitted into a U.N . police force , acting under either the Council or the Assembly . <P> If a crisis like the Korean invasion arose next week , Russia would undoubtedly veto Council action . Under the present rules , U.N . would thereafter be unable to do anything except talk . Under the proposed rules , the Assembly would go into session , hear from its Commission and call up the nations to fight the aggressor with those units of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . work . <P> Russia 's Andrei Vishinsky , taking a deceptively soft line , said that he favored " some " of the proposals . His speeches soon showed that he was against essential changes . He argued that the present Charter nowhere gives the Assembly the right to control U.N . police forces . He insisted that U.N . could deal with breaches of the peace only if the great powers were in agreement . <P> Vishinsky was on fairly solid ground when he said that the proposals violated the letter and spirit of the Charter drawn at San Francisco . But the Charter could not be amended unless the Russians agreed . The non-Communist nations faced the choice between evading the Charter 's veto provisions or junking U.N . as a peacekeeping instrument . <P> The U.N . Charter would either bend in the direction of its new proposals-or break .
