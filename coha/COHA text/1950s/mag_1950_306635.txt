Ever since Monsignor Joseph Charbonneau 's sudden resignation last month ( TIME , Feb. 20 ) , Quebec has been wondering who would take his place in Montreal 's red brick archbishop 's palace . When Rome announced Charbonneau 's successor last week , he turned out to be a man whom few had thought of : Monsignor Paul-Emile Lger , 45 , a native Quebecker who had spent half of his religious career outside Canada . So unexpected was his appointment that on the day of the announcement only one French newspaper in Montreal could produce his photograph . <P> Rumors &; Denials . Energetic Msgr . Lger was no stranger in the inner councils of the church . The son of a Quebec village storekeeper , ordained in 1929,416 went to Japan , proved himself an able administrator in directing the Sulpician Seminary at Fukuoka , later came back to Canada and taught at the House of Philosophy in Montreal . Since 1947 he has been rector of the Pontifical Canadian College in Rome where he was responsible for the guidance of Canadian priests studying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pope . Said one Vatican insider : " I always thought he would be a bishop from the moment I set eyes on him . " <P> A friendly , tactful man , at home in English as well as French , Msgr . Lger seemed a perfect choice for bilingual Montreal . " It was like slipping a glove over a hand , " a Vatican spokesman explained , " so easy when the glove fits well . " <P> In Montreal , the largest diocese of predominantly Roman Catholic Quebec , Monsignor Lger has one of the most delicate church assignments in North America . After more than three centuries of close alliance , church &; state in Quebec are seriously at odds on social issues . <P> The Catholic Church takes the position that Quebec 's labor-baiting Premier Maurice Duplessis is not moving fast enough to liberalize provincial laws and raise living standards . The 90,000-member Canadian and Catholic Confederation of Labor , with church approval , defied the government last year when it supported a violent strike against the Quebec asbestos companies which the Duplessis regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studies has openly condemned provincial labor legislation ; " labor priests " have acted as strike leaders . When Archbishop Charbonneau resigned " for reasons of health , " the rumor persisted , despite official denial , that the church had eased him out because he had carried his pro-labor policy too far . <P> Men &; Christians . Msgr . Lger , who had not been directly involved in the Quebec struggle , had a chance to bring about better church relations with Premier Duplessis . At the same time the church made it sharply clear that his appointment was in no way a repudiation of Charbonneau ( who last week was made a Roman count and a special assistant to the Pope ) . In a 35,000-word pastoral letter , a summary of which was read last Sunday from Roman Catholic pulpits in the province , Quebec 's bishops firmly restated the church 's principles on labor . Echoing the papal encyclicals Rerum Novarum ( 1891 ) and Quadragesima Anno ( 1931 ) , the letter demanded a greater share for labor in the ownership and profit of industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
