There , we agreed , beat the heart of another durable Roman power . Working in his chambers until long after dark was Pope Pius XII , whose spiritual authority enfolds some 469,600,000 men and women around the globe . Under his guidance the Roman Catholic church now exercises a powerful influence over more men , from peasants to royalty , than at any other time in its 1,900 years of existence ( page 466 ) . A silence fell on our group . It was my third visit to Rome , and the spread of towers and steeples brought back to me the hour of my first arrival some years earlier .

A jet of foaming water darted skyward , and a spotlight outlined a marble figure . A glow illuminated a rectangle of buildings , and I recognized the Renaissance front of a building I had studied in school . Beyond opened a piazza , one of Rome 's many open squares , like a stage set thronged with players . The city of the Romans had come alive for me . A child ran before us ; brakes screeched . The youngster 's frightened mother caught him up to punish him , but her overflowing love made her kiss him instead . Before tables on the sidewalk a singer threw out impudent verses . Against the ripple of the fountain , the sound of a violin rose in the evening ; a couple embraced in the shadows .

The Romans are proverbial for their faith in themselves and in their city . For them this is the true home of civilization . And , as a matter of fact , Rome keeps gaining meas- urably in importance for Italy and for Europe . In recent years the city 's population has increased astonishingly , much like certain thriving areas of the west coast of the United States . Because of continuing hardship in southern Italy , tens of thousands move northward . They pack ever more heavily into the expanding capital , which continues , as always , to turn them into Romans . " When In Rome ... " Even I , who had started out to live my time in Rome as an American , soon found my ways changing .

Planning an automobile trip to near-by hill towns with the ItalianAmerican painter Salvatore Meo and two other Romans , I worried over one delay after another and finally said I would have to start by Friday . I got a depressed stare : " He 's acting like a train dispatcher . " I gave in . We left Sunday and stayed three days longer than planned . I was learning . Meanwhile I came to know well a small circle at what was soon one of my favorite afternoon places , a cafe along the wide and teeming Piazza del Popolo .

Practically everybody knew everybody else , or soon did , over golden Frascati . At other times I was welcomed at a small house in the Campagna , the near-by countryside , for hours redolent of tomato sauce , garlic , and warm cheer .

One was a spot at the edge of the formal Borghese Gardens on one of the highest rises of the city , where a balustraded area thrusts like a ship 's prow over the hazy yellow-pink sea of Rome 's roofs . Another was a fountain constructed like a boat in water , parallel to the Spanish Steps ( page 441 ) . This fantastic flight of steps is actually a combination of ever-outreaching flights .

It is difficult not to be moved by a small church along this Via Appia , and its tale . During Nero 's murderous campaigns against the early Christians , Peter the Fisherman fled Rome to save his life . Half a mile from the Porta San Sebastiano he had a vision of the Saviour .

Each morning the piazza closes to cars , and scores of people appear from nowhere to put up stalls for blossoms , for fish and meat , for vegetables and a great mixture of goods , new , secondhand , and third-hand . Soon customers arrive from alleyways , doorways , and adjoining streets . Sellers eye them shrewdly , argue , tempt .

About the square stroll two carabinieri , policemen with flowing capes , great shoulder straps , and tricorn hats with feathers . An old woman goes by with a cat in her arms : she is taking him to the park for a sunning . Just ahead , restaurant owners have put up brightly covered tables along the sidewalks. with boxes of greenery as division lines , or none at all ; here patrons eat spaghetti or minestrone under the eyes of passers-by . Past them whiz automobiles , the tiny ones called Topolino , or Mickey Mouse cars ; motor scooters ( page 442 ) ; bicycles ; and threewheeled vehicles with motors , glassed in so that they look like spaceships .

" the Senate and People of Rome " ? which still survives today in the form of the initials S.P.Q.R. on the city 's shield ( color map , pages 444-445 ) . This greatest power of ancient times stretched toward the ends of its world . Back rode swaggering victors , dragging trophies of sold , jewels , and art , parading kings and queens in chains. * All roads seemed indeed to lead to Rome , and into her narrow limits crowded slaves from Greece , from the East , and from each f the empire 's subject places .

Meanwhile from the conquered East there slipped in a new religious faith , regarded lightly at first .

In his reign Rome was burned and St. Paul beheaded.t Onlookers in Nero 's Circus gloated over the grim scenes . Later the father of Church history , Eusebius , described how Christian martyrs , defying their persecutors , often did not complain or cry for help but died smiling until the last agony .

Yet the Goths , Vandals , and later invaders were impressed in spite of themselves and spared a great deal ; each time Rome rebuilt . Long before then papal Rome had been born .

And , as in Paris , the cooking latter would often surpass that of the rated restaurants . om did I come upon anything readyred : dishes are boiled , broiled , or baked the customers relax . the kitchen cooks and helpers scurry een hills of meat and bits of fowl ; eggt simmer in butter , and tomatoes are erated with care .

Part of their rpose is to avoid a cleaning bill ; but part it , surely , is to keep up that good appeare no matter what happens . The owners of small restaurants take an interest in the customer . I dawdled over lunch one day . Three of the proprietor 's family approached in turn : Was the food not good today ? I said I had a headache . What kind of headache ? And so on . I learned to expect interruptions while talking with friends in modest restaurants . A small boy or a nun would enter , holding out a hand in silent appeal .

Peddlers have to live too , signore . By 4 p. m. offices and businesses reopen , and Rome settles down to work again . At such times I liked to walk about the smaller streets , listening to the buzz and clank of artisans and workmen who make up most of Rome 's labor force : furniture makers , carvers , shoemakers , each with only one or two helpers . For generations such men have developed their Italian skills , their instinct for the good line , their adroit hand with wood and leather , ivory and marble . Knowing them better , I discovered how these average Romans manage their affairs and finances . The biggest factor in their calculations , in their hourly thoughts , is the family . Romans Cherish Family Ties The Roman and his wife and children are far from alone in their world . They have brothers and sisters down the street , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Possibly they have with them a child with no legal claim on them ; out of generosity Romans frequently care for a waif . In the clan all have responsibilities . To refuse help to a cousin or to turn away an uncle would be unnatural , a thing to cause heartbreak and also bad luck . Relatives and friends go in and out ; from the Campagna comes one , then another , to hunt work in Rome or to make a business deal . This helps all around ; a nephew with a part-time job has a roof over him , and his contribution helps the family budget while he stays . In one case I met what seemed to be a family of six living in three rooms . At dusk , however , eight or nine others arrived for the night , and in each room several slept on pallets or on the floor .  |p476  The salary of the head of the house often can not support the family .

" " If you have to have a clock , try Monday . Everything goes down on the first .... " When his suit became too shabby , he received a tailor 's special rate for a new one , because his sister worked in a store that sold buttons to this tailor at a discount . Most Romans pay more for their clothes in proportion to income than do Americans , but they make them last longer . Even so , they can not afford the expensive shops or even the few stores selling ready-made clothes . They patronize the piccolo ( little ) tailor and dressmaker . The scale of all their living is piccolo , a series of piccolo savings . Almost nothing is thrown away ? wrapping paper , aluminum paper , string . About to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a housewife . " Prego ( please ) . We can use it . " Often a man will buy only three or six cigarettes at a time . His wife purchases in tiny lots too ? a few pieces of fruit , a quarter pound of something , enough for a meal at a time . Twenty lire saved here , 50 there ; so the Romans live . Usually there is no money for larger purchases . If there is , the wife will still hesitate . A family crisis , an accident , or a relative in trouble could throw everything out of calculation . As it is , the family generally ends the month with a financial struggle . At many shops the employees borrow from each other . and the first of the month brings a general settling of accounts , 150 lire to Mimmo , 30C to Paolo ....

A window is to be looked through ; a footstep is to be heard . " All this is life , " the Roman smiles . " Why should n't we be interested ?

It is hardly possible to walk in any direction in Rome without finding a place of worship : two or three may rise in the same block , around the same wide piazza .

St. Peter 's Dome Crowns Vatican City The heart of Catholicism is a sun-swept rise west of the Tiber , beyond the range of the long-fabled seven . Here rises St. Peter 's , with the ornamented dome that dominates Rome in more ways than one ( page 438 ) . Beside it lies Vatican City , since 1929 once more a sovereign state but now shrunk to a walled-in area of less than 110 acres . To it many nations send accredited representatives .

Some count 1,000 rooms in the Papal Palace : others claim that figure is too small . Inside the walls is a mass of man 's great works of art , ageless treasures on canvas , in gold and marble , in books and architecture . Rome stops abruptly at the edges of Vatican City . Inside live about a thousand men and women , with their own flag , their own currency and postage stamps , shops , small industries , a newspaper , a powerful radio station , and a tiny railroad : not least , their own police , of several varieties , one with rules and costumes dating back to the Renaissance .

Three-headed Cerberus , guardian of Hades , barks at his master 's feet . Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini , the sculptor , showed unusual skill in turning marble into flesh ; Pluto 's fingers make realistic indentations .

In 11 years Bernini fashioned a great curving line of powerful quadruple columns , reaching out like two arms in an almost closed ellipse ( page 439 ) .

Moving the Immovable Obelisk Legend says the Renaissance Pope Sixtus V ordered it moved , despite advice that the job was impossible . A thousand workmen and scores of horses struggled with beams , ropes , and scaffolding until the ponderous object was lifted and teetered perilously in air . Sixtus had ordered silence , under penalty of death , so that his engineers would not be distracted . But a sailor , seeing some of the ropes stretching , disobeyed the order and shouted the remedy : " Water on the ropes !

Slowly the stranger moves about the effigies , the altars , the massive cherubs , the bronze statue of St. Peter with its foot rubbed smooth by fingers and lips of the devout . He goes to the high altar , where only the Pope may say Mass . Its canopy is held aloft by four spiral bronze columns , and long shafts of light pour on it through amber windows . The stranger can ride the elevator to the roof , with Michelangelo 's dome soaring above him there , and climb high to the ball above for a celebrated view of Rome spreading on all sides .

The Ordeal of Michelangelo The project took four years of agonizing labor , during which Michelangelo lived for long periods on scaffolds , working in strange positions , frequently in pain . At one point he wrote : - My stomach points toward my chin , my beard turns toward the sky , my skull rests on my back . " He knew troubles of other kinds : the Pope 's master of ceremonies criticized his work and Michelangelo got revenge by presenting his enemy 's features as the face of Minos , judge of hell .

Elsewhere nuns  |p490  painstakingly repair ancient tapestries , and laymen labor in dozens of shops to preserve crumbling documents , books , and statuary .

On both Sunday afternoons a great crowd pushed through St. Peter 's doors to stand in the open area leading to the glowing papal altar . Thousands of lights shone down upon scarlet draperies and the colored likeness of the individual to be beatified . On such occasions there is a hum , a stir of men and women for whom this hour has a profound significance . They wait and wait . the tension increasing with every passing minute . Here and there bustle officials of a dozen kinds , with ushers in velvet knee breeches , red waistcoats , and black tail coats .

In the piazza thousands stand , their eyes lifted upward , for they know that he will eventually appear in a small window of his third-floor apartment . A light goes on , the shutters are thrown back , and Pius XII is there to give his blessings . Many kneel , and voices rise that must reach him as a faint echo in the approaching dusk . Then the blinds close . The crowds melt silently away . Halo Glows with Modern Light After that second beatification , on my final day in Rome .

On the wall of a room fitted in chromium and leather also perched a tiny shrine ? a modernized Madonna and Child in plastic , with circle of light in neon .
