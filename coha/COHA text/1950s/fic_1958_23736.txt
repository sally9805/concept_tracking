The Guy in Ward 4 i OR PO K AL James Bowie Tompkins was from " Kaintucky , " he said , " right from the hill people an ' sour-math . " He always said it with mockery , with crafty eyes and a smile he kept on his face like a Halloween mask . He was only twenty-one , but he had an old man 's face . He was just over five feet five , wiry , compact , and he walked with a bantam cock 's bravado . He had the special courage of the small or the weak , the courage of necessity . He came to our Air Force post in the American Southwest with fifty-two missions behind him , a Purple Heart , a citation for valor , and a battered guitar . He lived in the pleasant and unhurried world of the Convalescent Ward , where he won no friends , made no enemies , shared no secrets , offered no portion of his self or his past to the others . Each night , he stole out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rec Hall , where he took a wicker chair in the darkest corner and strummed on his guitar and drank booze from a long-necked beer bottle until he drowned in insensibility . No one could figure out how he kept getting the booze and where he kept hiding it . We might never have known any of this had it not been for one of the orderlies , Private Jackson Laibowitz . One hazy afternoon , when the burning sun was veiled by clouds . Laibowitz brought a glass of hot tea into the office of Captain Josiah Newman , Chief of the Neuropsychiatric Section ( Ward 8 ) , taking the occasion to declaim without warning , as was his wont , " In Ward 4 is a guy you should take right away to WarcE8 . " Captain Newman put down his reading glasses and sighed . " Ca n't you ever find a man in Ward 8 who would be better off in Ward 4 ? " " Games , " said Laibowitz acidly , " are for children . " " So is sarcasm , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted . " Captain Newman sipped the tea and winced as he burned his tongue . " Dammit , Laibowitz , did we run out of ice ? " " Ice freezes the muscles , " said Laihowitz , who had many original theories about men and medicine . " Heat relaxes the same . " " Tell me about the man in Ward 4 , " said Captain Newman glumly . " I 'm glad you brought up the subject , " said Laibowitz . " Well  --  last night , in Rec Hall , I find this joker sleeping in a chair , passed out and stinkin ' from booze . When I shake him to get up , he mumbles , ' Okay , Big Jim , let 's cream them tonight . ' His name is Tompkins . My diagnosis , " said Laibowitz sagely , " is depression , acute and severe . I told him to go see you . " Captain Newman groaned . " Jackson , for the hundredth time , it is not part of your duties to go around the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who except the sick can profit ? " And Laibowitz left , with an expression that showed that the Captain would bear watching . The next morning , Newman entered his office to find a short , lean Corporal behind his desk , in his chair , tilted far back , his feet on the desk . Newman paused . The young man grinned , waving a hand , " Come in , Captain . I been waitin ' . " " You 've been doing more than that , " said Newman , The Corporal smirked . " 1 just like to put in ' feet up . " He got up abruptly and picked up the guitar he had leaned against the wall . " I ai n't stayin ' . You want me to talk , come to Rec Hall . At night . When I 'm swacked . I ai n't promisin ' nothin ' .. .7 , Newman let his glance rest on Tompkins . " Do you want to talk ? " " Hell , no . And no head-shrinker like you is gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flak-juice either ! I 'm wise to the way you hook ' em  --  get ' em talkin ' , then slip ' em the needle . " " No , " Newman said . " Never , unless a man asks for it . " " Asks for it ? " Tompkins repeated . " Say , that 's pretty cute . Well , Little Jim ai n't askin ' for it . I hear that flak-juice knocks you out , an ' you start gabbin ' and gabbin ' an ' when you git up you do n't remember a single thing . Right ? " " Something like that . " " 1 knew I had you taped , " Tompkins said slyly . Newman shrugged . ? Flak-juice ' is sodium pen tothal . It gives you a kind of twilight sleep . It helps you remember . " " Remember ? Remember what ? " " What you ca n't forget , " said Newman . Tompkins stared at him and licked his lips . " Nuts ! That 's for psychos . Not me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hold out your hands , Jim . . . I wo n't touch you . " Tompkins held out his hands and grinned . " Steady as rocks . " " Sure , " said Newman . " Now turn them over . " Tompkins turned his hands palms up . They were glistening with sweat . Newman said , " Thanks , Jim , " and turned away . Tompkins studied his hands thoughtfully and wiped them on his shirt . " Some things ai n't purty , Doc . Some things jest ai n't putty ! " He grabbed the guitar and hurried out . In a moment , Private Laibowitz materialized in the doorway . " What is your diagnosis , Doc ? " " It is customary , " said Captain Newman coolly , " to greet an officer in the morning by saying , Good morning , sir . ' " " I said ' Good morning , sir , ' yesterday . " " How time flies . " " You do n't have to hide your emotions from me , Doc , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain New- man returned to his office and left the door 1% ide open . But Tompkins did not appear . He did not appear the next morning either , nor the next . Every time Laibowitz caught Captain New-man 's eye , he looked disgusted . One night , just as Newman was about to go home , the short , defiant Corporal appeared in the doorway with his guitar . He looked a little unsteady . " Hello , Jim , " said Newman . Tompkins snorted . " I guess you did n't want to hear me talk after all , . Doc , huh ? " " Why do you say that ? " " You did n't come to Rec Hall . " " It 's better to talk here . " " Not for me , it ai n't . You come alone , an ' if I 'm swacked enough ? " Suddenly , Tompkins dropped the grinning mask of his deception , his face gaunt , and cursed , muttering , " It ai n't putty , Doc . Jeeze , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it ai n't , Jim . It ai n't purty at all . " A light flared in Tompkins ' eyes and burned out the panic . " I ai n't beggin ' , see ? You want me to talk , you know where you can find me . God-clam you , Doc ! " Tompkins swung his guitar into the air and lunged out of the door . The next morning- , Private Jackson Laibowitz announced , without warning , " It is my opinion that Tompkins is ready for treatment . " " Laibowitz ? " Newman began , " ? it is not the function of a wardman to advise the chief of the neuropsychiatric service ? " " From peasants I expect pride . From psychiatrists I expect imagination . " " Jackson ! " " You say that like in front is written ' Stonewall . ' " He hated to be called Jackson ; he resented being addressed as Laibowitz ; he felt the warm , redeeming glow of equality only when his Captain called him Jake . 62 THE GUY IN WARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Newman firmly , " that I know what I 'm doing . " Laibowitz shrugged . " Who does n't ? " Captain Newman said carefully , " Tompkins is not ready to talk . He wants me to come to him . If I do , he 'll interpret it as a triumph ? " " So let him . All his life a loser , this once throw him a hand . " " Laibowitz , will you listen ? " " What am 1 doing , " cried Laibowitz , " skiing ? " Newman sank into his chair , wondering fur the thousandth time what it was about Jackson Laibowitz that could drive you to despair  --  intransigence ? arrogance ? pride ? the inability to conform ? the wild joyousness of dissent ? an egomania so vast , so impenetrable that  --  whatever it was , it was a force that was unyielding , unreachable , unswayable . It was , by God , the sort of thing that had made our country strong . " Listen , Jake , " Newman sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as long as he makes a contest of this , as long as he sets up tricks to test my strength . " He wondered  --  vaguely  --  why in hell he was taking the trouble to tell Laibowitz all this . " Tompkins will come to me when he 's ready , really ready ; when his defenses against asking for help crumble , when his suffering surmounts his hostility , when his need overwhelms his fear . Then  --  perhaps  --  I can help him . " Laibowitz listened to all this with the air of a savant grading the recitation of a precocious student , cocked his head to one side and pronounced judgment . " Doc , you have changed my whole opinion of the case . Have some cookies . " That afternoon , when Captain Newman returned from lunch , he found a sealed envelope on his desk , addressed : Big shot Cuckoo Squad Inside , on the back of a prescription blank , in a cramped , childlike hand , was printed : Rec Hall . Tonight . After Lights . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T E R the lights were turned out in the wards , that night , Captain Newman went down the ramp that led from Ward 8 to the main building of the hospital . Several table lamps were burning dimly in the empty Rec Hall . Newman turned them off and went to the farthest corner and sat down in a wicker chair . He turned that lamp on , picked up a copy of Baseball , and waited . In a moment , he heard a shuffle near the side door and a hoarse , heavy whisper . " Doc ... turn off the light . " " Not yet , Jim . Come in . " Tompkins hesitated . The guitar hung limply at his side . " They 'll gig me if they find me in here . " " I 'll take care of that . " Tompkins entered slowly and dropped into a wicker rocker , putting the guitar across his knees , studying it . " You like to hear the gee-tar , Doc ? " " I 'd rather you talked . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurted . " Goddammit , I ai n't even swacked . Wait . I 'll  --  oh Jeeze . " Tompkins struck some angry chords on the guitar . " Hell , Doc , that 's a Iie . Little Jim 's swacked already . I got me tanked up good before I come in . That 's a fact . " He was plucking out a melody that sounded like a hundred other songs from the hills two thousand miles away . " Oh , Jeeze . Oh , Jeeze , Doc . 1 feel it acomin ' on . I 'm gon na talk . An ' it ai n't purtyl I want to fergit it . I got to fergit it ! " " You ca n't , " said Newman . " You ca n't really forget until you 've remembered . " The fingers on the strings arched like talons . " Hey , that 's pretty good , man . That 's pretty damn good ! Well , I 'm not gon na tell you , see  --  not all of it anyway . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Jim , an ' one hell of a flyer . Man , could he handle that crate ! Only guy in the whole goddam outfit knew how to handle a B-24 . " He gave the foolish , vacant laugh of inebriation . " I 'd get me loaded every damn night , hidin ' in different places , every night before we had to go up . Know what it means if you do n't show up for a mission , Doc ? But Little Jim always showed up . Yup . You know why ? ' Cause he 'd find me . Big Jim . No matter where I 'd hide , I 'd feet this big paw shakin ' me and hear that bastard 's voice saying ' , ' Come on , kid , time to go . This is Big Jim . Come on , Little Jim , we got to take a ride . We got to kill us some Jerries ! ' An ' l 'd open my eyes and see that guinea grinnin ' at me , an ' I 'd say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art ' I 'm Little Jim an ' no one 's ever gon na get us two . ' An ' he 'd pull me to my feet and walk me out that goddam field and get me in that goddam crate . ... Only buddy I ever had , Doc . Only guy ever took care of Little Jim . An ' I  --  I ? " The tears began to course down his cheeks . " Goddam it , Doc , do n't let me talk no more ! Please . Stop me . If I remember about Big Jim , I 'll  --  blow  --  my  --  top . I 'm tellin ' you , I 'll blowmy  --  top ! Stop me , Doc . Please stop me . I 'll smash up that lamp and throw around them chairs and push in ' fists through all the goddam glass in the windows ! " " Sure , " Newman growled with deliberate harshness . " You 'll smash up the lamp and throw around them chairs and push your fists through all the goddam glass in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy . Not one goddam bit . And you know it ! You 've done it before , and it did n't help ; and it wo n't help now . " Tompkins looked at Newman with bleary eyes , sobbing . " That 's where the flak-juice comes in , do n't it ? " " Yes . " " Oh , Jeeze , " Tompkins moaned . " I 'm in a sweat . I do n't want to think of it . " " But you 're thinking of it all the time , day and night , week after week , month after month after month . You ca n't stop thinking of it . " " It ai n't true ! " " That 's why you play the guitar  --  to use up your thoughts . That 's why you fight off sleep  --  so you wo n't dream . That 's why you get swacked  --  to deaden memory . " Newman changed the timbre of his voice abruptly . " What a stupid way to live ! What a goddam stupid way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guitar , fleeing down the avenue of tears . " When did it happen ? " asked Newman . " Come on , boy . When ? " Tomkins sniffled . " Last time up ... November 17 . We took off , 6:05 . Me an ' ? " he caught himself and cried , " Yeah ! You 're right ! I 'm goddam stupid . I 'm a no-good yellow-belly who ? oh  --  Jeeze , okay , Doc , , gim me the flak-juice . I 'm askin ' for it . Give it t ' me . Please . Right now ! " Newman made himself yawn and got to his feet slowly . " Okay , Buster . Come to my office tomorrow . Around eleven . " Tompkins regarded him with astonishment and distress . " You ai n't gon na do it now ? Right now , when I 'm askin ' for it ? " " Nape . I 'm bushed . I 'll see you tomorrow . Eleven o'clock . " Tompkins wiped the corner of his eyes with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything you say , Doc . " Newman started for the door . Tompkins was not following him . He was nestling down in the chair , working his shoulders like a cat . Newman paused , frowning , then pushed his voice into the simulated emotion of a shout : " Goddammit , Tompkins , what 's the matter with you ? Why do n't you go to bed ? Have n't you beaten yourself up enough for one night ? Do n't you hove . ony pity ? " Tompkins gave a cry , leaping out of the chair . " Okay , okay , do n't blow a gasket ! I 'm goin ' . Jeeze , they sure picked the right guy to boss the loony squad ! " He staggered past Newman with a clutter of elbows and knees and unguarded emotion . He was halfway to Ward 4 when he reeled , hiccuping , stumbling , trying to use the guitar as a crutch , sinking at last to the floor like a melting candle . Captain Newman called for an orderly once , twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporal James Bowie Tompkins and carried him down the deserted corridor through the doors to Ward 4 , the guitar still clutched in Tompkins hand . As he put the limp , surprisingly light body clown on an empty bed , he heard the boy mumblc : " Hey .. Big Jim . . . knew you 'd come back ... thanks . " F ROM 10:50 to 10:59 the next morning , while Captain Newman was finishing his rounds in Ward 8 , Private Jackson Laibowitz kept clearing his throat , groaning , hacking , looking at his watch , making grandiose references to the passage of time , announcing at last in a bell-like tone , " It is eleven o'clock . " " Why did n't anyone keep time for me before ? " Newman asked dryly . " Before , " said Laibowitz acidly , " you were surrounded by apple-polishers . Now you arc assisted by realists . " " How did you find out Tompkins is coming ? " Laibowitz blinked his eyes with monumental innocence . " In case he 'll need flak-juice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you ? " " I want you should attend to your own work . " " Progress does not come from turning down talent , " said Laihowitz darkly . Newman went to his office . Tompkins was not sitting in the chair this time . He was standing just inside the doorway , pale as a blotter , his shoulders turned inward , not carrying his guitar , his face harried and anxious . " Let 's git goin ' . I want to git it over with . " " Okay . Lie down , Jim . On the cot . " " You  --  gon na squirt the scuff in me ? " Newman picked Up a hypodermic . " Yes . This is no different from any other shot . When I tell you to , start counting  --  backwards , from 100 . " He pulled 20 cc of a 21/2 per cent solution of sodium pentothal into the needle , put a tourniquet on Tompkins ' arm to make the vein bigger , and rubbed a swab of alcohol on the skin above it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ring of sweat forming on his neck like a bracelet . " Roger . " Newman jabbed the needle into a cubital vein , depressing the plunger gently . " Start counting . backward . " Tompkins emitted a brief " Oh ! " then a sigh , then began counting : " Hundercl . ninety-nine . . . eight . . . seven .. six ... Hunderd  --  hey , where am I ? ? . forty ... oh . . . give me more . . . good . . . seven . . . " By the time the calibrated plunger showed 16 cc. had gone into Tompkins ' vein , the boy was making obscure , muttering sounds and tossing his head . His mouth opened and his lips made faint sucking movements ; his breathing changed , deepening , devoid of control , devoid of apprehension , as the narcotic cloak enveloped him . It was 11:04 . N O W Newman leaned to Tompkin 's ear and began to talk , softly , his voice infinitely reassuring , mimicking the accent and inflection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... we 're vitt ' up now . . . okay . It 's Tuesday , November seventeenth-6:05 in the morning . Come on , Little Jim . We got to take a ride . We got to kill us some Jerries ... . Man , that crate 's all warmed up ... we 're in it . . . ready ... Let 's go , boy ... come on .. . " His tone was coaxing , wooing , promising , in its very hushed resonance , that all would be well , that pain was agonizing but not fatal , that it was not an end of days nor a floodgate of punishment and horror , that it was safe to enter the past again . Tompkins ' head moved from side to side , and he moaned . " Olt , Jeeze . no ... I don ' wan na go up . This one 's a sweat-job . . Okay , Big Jim ! " he shouted . " Here we go . . . hot , it 's so hot . Hi , Buck , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Goddam them motors .... Upup  --  up . Go  --  Jim  --  up ! Jccze , wo n't he never get this goddam coffin off the groun ' ? yih ! We 're up ! ? . This is a cinch , sure . Nothin ' comin ' at us , nothin ' shootin ' . Gunner to pilot ; gunner to pilot : ' Okay if I take a practice shot ? Roger . ' " Tompkins ' hands came up as if he were moving a big gun , sighting , and his voice imitated a burst of gunfire . " Pr-r-r- ! P-r-r-r-I . . . Shoot the breeze . . Cinchy . What 's that ? Down there ! No , oh , Jeeze , comin ' at us ! Go back ! Cap , please , the flak . I'Vhere ? Four o'clock . M.E. 109 . . . You dirty murdcrin ' Heinie ? " His whole body shook as , holding the imaginary gun , he rattled off a burst of fire to the Messerschmitt that was once more coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Look't ' im bust open . He 's goin ' down ! Burn ! Yellow bastard ! Burn ! " He stopped , burbling , and screamed . " We 're hit ! .. . Oh , no ! Omigod . Oh , Jesus ! Dear Jesus . Save me , please , God . I 'll be good . I 'll be a good boy . The number 2 ? We 're droppin ' . Ma ! We 're gon na crash ! Jim ! Pull ' er up , up please  --  lookout ! " A long , attenuated " O0000h ! " of terror , the sound pulled out like taffy ; then a scream from the boy , his face gray paste , dripping with sweat , his head jerking , tossing , turning , a bubble of foam trickling out of the corner of his mouth . Captain Newman leaned closer and depressed the plunger he had never removed from the boy 's vein , sending another cc into the vein , murmuring . " C'm on . Okay , boy . C'm on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're in that plane . " He withdrew the needle . Tompkins ' hands flew up over his head and grabbed the iron rung of the cot . " Smoke ! Lemme out ! Oh , Christ . We 're burnin ' ! Out  --  out ! " He pulled himself against the frame of the cot , straining , bulging his arms , astonishingly quick , his body trying to repeat an earlier escape through a hatch . " Oh , Jeeze . Outa my wayBuckl Mother o ' God , he ai n't got no head ! Buck ! Oh , God ! Put back his head . Please  --  someone  --  he do n't look right , Fire ! Tanks . They 'll go . Get out . . . Pull . . . . . I 'm out ! Yay ! Jump ! Run . What 's that ? ... Who 's yellin ' ? " Tompkins ' face and arms and writhing body froze , just as the voice from the burning plane had frozen him that morning as he 'd run away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Little Ji-i-m ! ' " 711111W -- Tompkins ' voice spilled out in a thin , high echoing wail . " ' Help . . . Save me . Little Go back ! Pull him out  --  but the tanks ... " From the boy 's mouth came a whooshing , hollow roar like the roar of a plane catching fire . ' Run ! Run ! Run ! " Tompkins ' head snapped sidewards , insensate , and his lips parted and sound rattled in his throat and he lost the consciousness he had lost once before . Captain Newman watched him for a moment , hearing the rasp of his own breathing , feeling the sodden weight of silence , and he felt the perspiration running down his face . He stared at Tompkins absently , his face sagging , and he could feel the blood squeezing into his legs . It was stifling hot in the room . He unbuttoned his collar and stood up and opened the window . The sun was hammering on the drum of the sky . He wiped his lace with his hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt dry and spent now . He wondered how much men can endure  --  how much fear and terror and unutterable pain . " God . . " he thought . No . In this universe of another man 's soul he had entered , God was silent . He felt a sudden rush of protest . He was no angel of deliverance . He felt suddenly alone , abandoned , and unaided in some darkening arena where beasts of horror roved . " We ask too much of them , " he thought . And who was he of whom they asked so much  --  in strength and insight 's intercession ? He wiped his throat and neck with a towel and noticed that his hands were shaking . He poured some water into a glass from the carafe his orderlies had given him for Christmas , and dipped his handkerchief into the glass and cooled his temples . He got a cigarette and was about to light it , but put it down , troubled , looking at Tompkins . In time , Tompkins gave a massive , arching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jeeze ... I musta dozed off . " " Jeeze , I feel tired . Best I slept in months . " Tompkins sat up , yawning , and moved his feet to the floor . He noticed die stains on his shirt and pants . " Chris ' . I 'm sweatin ' like a pig . That 's what I 'm sweatin ' like  --  a goddam pig . " " How about a cigarette ? " Newman held the pack out and Tompkins yawned again and took a cigarette , mumbling , " Man , I musta got me ten , twelve hours shut-eye . " He yawned and rubbed his eyes again . " Hey , Doc , d'I talk in m ' sleep ? " " Uh , huh . " He hesitated , blinking his eyes ; then he licked his lips nervously . " What d'l say , Doc ? " " Omigod , " Newman groaned , " every one of you guys thinks you 're so damn special . I 'm not passing out any prizes for suffering ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the running . Hell , I was expecting stuff would blow me right out of my seat . No , you 're not even in the running . I 've got guys in that ward make you look like Little Miss Mullet . " " But I  --  Rig Jim ? " " I know all about it , " said Newman harshly . " Come in tomorrow . Now get the hell out of here and run around the track or play some volleyball . I 've got work to do . " Tompkins grinned weakly and left . He was whistli ng . In several minutes , Private Laihowitz entered . He studied Captain Newman and sat down without a word . After a while he ventured , " That kid from Kentucky . It was n't pretty , huh ? " Newman glanced out of the window . The heat was shivering across the face of the earth . " No , it was n't pretty , Jake . " W H E N Tompkins came into Captain Newman 's office the next morning , he was strutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lilting back in a chair , putting his feet up on Newman 's desk . " Feel great this morning . Shoot . " Newman surveyed Tompkins icily . " Take your goddam feet off my desk , soldier . And do n't ever pull that kind of stuff on me again . " Tompkins brought his feet down to the floor with a slam , his eyes simmering . " When you 're here , " said Newman , " you 'll show respect  --  for me , and for yourself . I 'm not going to let you cheapen any guy who did fifty-two missions and wears all that spinach on his chest ! Listen . I 'm going to help you  --  even if you fight me every inch of the way . I can be just as rough on you as you are on yourself . So let 's take the gloves off and give you a real good shel-lacking . " Tompkins glared at him in silence . " Attaboy , " said Newman sarcastically . " Keep torturing yourself . Keep blaming yourself . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ran away when you heard Big j irn yelling . . .

" " I ran out on him ! " cried Tompkins . " I let him die ! There was n't a piece of hint left even 66 THE GUY IN WARD 4 to bury  --  and that 's what l did , see ! And it was n't purty ! And I ai n't never gon na fergit it  --  never , never , never ! " He pounded the desk with his fist . Newman nodded . " Good . Now we 're getting somewhere . " " I 'm no good ! " " You sure ai n't . " " I 'm a goddam low-down yellow-belly coward ! " " Right , " said Newman . " You 're not worth the ammo to shoot your brains out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You never flew no fifty-two missions .

" shoulda gone back ! 1 shoulda pulled him out ! " " Right . You shoulda tried . But what makes you so damn sure you 'd been able to pull him out ? " Tompkins looked up . " Huh ? " " The plane would still have exploded  --  and blown you , too , into all those little pieces no one ever found .

That was being a rat , was n't it , a yellow-belly who always runs out on a pal crying for help ? " " " No ! I once dived in a burnin ' cockpit ? dragged out a guy ? " " Oh , let 's not put that on the score card , " Newman said ironically . " Let 's not let Jim Tompkins off the hook , boy . We got to punish that Tompkins real hard . After all , he personally shot down that B-24 himself ? " " Me ? You 're crazy ! It was flak  --  Messerschmitts . " " Oh , " said Newman with a grimace of disappointment . " I thought we could hang the whole crash on you . " " That do n't make sense ! " Newman hesitated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither does what you 've been doing to yourself .

But let 's figure out a reasonable amount of misery to pay off that guilt . . . Jim , I 've got an idea . Why do n't you chop off your foot ? " Tompkins ' eyes widened and he stared at Newman . " You heard me , boy . Why do n't you go out and get an axe and chop off your foot ? " " I do n't giL it . " " How about your hand , then ? Lots of guys pay off with an ' accident ' . You can , too . Go out , get careless . " " Do n't talk crazy ! " Newman shrugged . " Is a hand too much ? Then how about some toes ? Or a finger ? I think that would ? " " Stop ! None of that 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And neither will what you 've been doing to yourself , " said Newman quietly . Tompkins looked up , bewildered , gaunt , and buried his face in his hands and wept . Newman let him weep and weep and weep , until Tompkins moaned into his hands , " Oh , Jeeze . Mc cryin ' ? cryin ' like a kid . " " It 's about time . You 're crying for Jim . You ought to . You loved him , And he 's dead . " Newman paused . " You can let yourself feel now , Jim . That 's good . " Ile looked at his wrist watch . " Well , have we beat you up enough for one day ? Wash your face and get some coffee . . . See you tomorrow . ' ' F 4 V E R NI day at eleven , for a week , Tomp- kips came to Captain Newman . And every day  --  in varied ways , with varied intensities  --  Newman acted out the role of another man 's relentless conscience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the harshest self could he reach a man whose self had closed itself off to mercy . Each night , as he lay sleepless in his bed , Newman thought of the next day 's requirements : he would have to present Tompkins with the naked image of his own self-hatred , his own unreasoning harshness . And when punishment had run its course and pain cried out for surcease , he had to offer the boy a new conscience , a conscience which could replace and relax the frightful demands of the old . Yet it was not these thoughts that tore deepest at the fabric of Captain Newman 's sleep . These were insights from which to shape a design for healing . It was something else that reached through the darkness to rend his heart . " If I let him stay sick , the boy will live . If I make him well , the boy will die . . " For Newman knew that if what he was doing succeeded , Tompkins would surely ask to go back into combat . But if he let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ball of internalized hate  --  the boy could live on in Ward 8 until this war , and perhaps another , would end . " My job is to make them well , " Newman thought , " well enough to get killed . " Was this the goal of his calling ? Was this what he had dedicated himself to ? N E morning Tompkins came in late and said , straight off : " Think I can get back overseas , Doc ? " Newman felt the beat of his pulse quicken . " Why ? " " It figgers that way , that 's all . I did n't kill Big Jim . You know who did ? The ferries . Them goddam Nazzies . So I want another crack at them , Doe . To even up the score . Whadya say ? You goin ' to fix it for me to git back to some shootin ' ? " That was the moment Newman had hoped fur , wanted , hated , dreaded . " I hear the missions are getting rougher and rougher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of our guys are getting shot up . " " Sure are . " " You can get your goddam head blown off in one of those raids , " said Newman . Tompkins shot him a quick look . " You sure can , Doc . " Newman took a moment to pour some water . " You know you can stick around here a little longer , .. " " Nope , Doc . 1 got to git out of here . A couple more missions , Doc , that 's all I want . " " Why ? " Tompkins hesitated . " I jest owe it to Big Jim , I guess . And them other guys that went down with him . " Ten days later , Corporal James Bowie Tompkins , AAF , gunner , was shipped out , out of the hospital , off our post on a desert palpable with heat , to an Eighth Air Force squadron somewhere in the green and mist of England . It was two months later , just after Easter , when the heat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings of blessed chill , that Laibowitz came rushing in with a letter from a pal in England : Corporal James Bowie Tompkins , of Boonefort , Kentucky , was in the lead plane on a block-buster raid on Berlin , had shot down two Nazis , and was last seen going down with nine comrades in the pyre of a Flying Fortress , down , doomed , headlong , flaming . " Christ , Doc , " cried Laibowitz , " you saved that boy . " Captain Newman went into his office and closed the door . He wanted to lock the door , but he did n't . He wanted to take a drink ( it would be wonderful to get drunk ) but he did n't . He sat down in his chair and turned it so that his back was to the door and lie stared across the parade grounds into the baking and merciless sunset . His temples were throbbing , his throat parched , but lie could feel his palms breaking into sweat . And even then , he made himself remember that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  would be plunged into unutterable despair if good old Captain Newman kept him waiting .
