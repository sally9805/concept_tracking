WE ARE all of us , in our family , very fond of puzzles . I do Double-Crostics and read mystery stories , my husband does baseball box scores and figures out batting averages , our son Laurie is addicted to the kind of puzzle which begins , " There are fifty-four items in this picture beginning with the letter C , " our older daughter Jannie does children 's jigsaws , and Sally , the baby , can put together an intricate little arrangement . of rings and bars which has had the rest of us stopped for two months . We are none of us , however , capable of solving the puzzles we work up for ourselves in the oddly diffuse patterns of our several lives ( who is , now I think of it ? ) ; and along with such family brain-teasers as , " Why is there a pair of roller skates in Mommy 's desk ? " and , " What is really in the back of Laurie 's closet ? " and , " Why does n't Daddy wear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we are all of us still wondering nervously about what might be called The Great Grippe Mystery . As a matter of fact , I should be extremely grateful if anyone could solve it for us , because we are certainly very short of blankets , and it 's annoying not to have any kind of answer . Here , in rough outline , is our puzzle : 0 UR house is large , and the second floor has four bedrooms and a bathroom , all opening out onto a long narrow hall which we have made even narrower by liningit with bookcases so that every inch of hall which is not doorway is books . As is the case with most houses , both the front door and the back door are downstairs on the first floor . The front bedroom , which is my husband 's and mine , is the largest and lightest , and has a double bed . The room next down the hall belongs to the girls , and contains a crib and a single , short bed . Laurie 's room , across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the top half . The guest room , at the end of the hall , has a double bed . The double bed in our room is made up with white sheets and cases , the baby 's crib has pink linen and Jannie 's bed has yellow . Laurie 's bed has green linen and the guest room has blue . The bottom half of Laurie 's bed is never made up , unless company is going to use it immediately , because the dog , whose name is Toby , traditionally spends a large part of his time there and regards it as his bed . There is no bed table on the distaff side of the double bed in our room . One side of the bed in the guest room is pushed against the wall . No one can fit into the baby 's crib except the baby ; the ladder to the top half of Laurie 's double-decker is very shaky and stands in a corner of the room ; the children reach the top half of the bed by climbing up over the footboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of apple juice , to which they are addicted , by their bedsides at night . My husband invariably keeps a glass of water by his bedside . Laurie uses a green glass , Jannie uses a red glass , the baby uses one of those little flowered cheese glasses , and my husband uses a tin glass because he has broken so many ordinary glasses trying to find them in the dark . I do not take cough drops or cough medicine in any form . The baby customarily sleeps with half a dozen cloth books , an armless doll , and a small cardboard suitcase which holds the remnants of half a dozen decks of cards . Jannie is very partial to a pink baby blanket , which has shrunk from many washings . The girls ' room is very warm , the guest room moderately so ; our room is chilly , and Laurie 's room is quite cold . We are all of us , including the dog , notoriously easy and heavy sleepers ; my husband never eats coffeecake . MY HUSBAND caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivered and complained until I prevailed upon him to go to bed . By Friday night both Laurie and the baby were feverish , and on Saturday Jannie and I began to cough and sniffle . In our family we take ill in different manners ; my husband is extremely annoyed at the whole procedure , and is convinced that his being sick is somebody else 's fault , Laurie tends to become a little light-headed and strew handkerchiefs around his room , Jannie coughs and coughs and coughs , the baby turns bright red , and I suffer in stoical silence , so long as everyone knows clearly that I am sick . We are each of us privately convinced that our own ailment is far more severe than anyone else 's . At any rate , on Saturday night I put all the children into their beds , gave each of them half an aspirin and the usual fruit juice , covered them warmly , and then settled my husband down for the night with his glass of water and his cigarettes and matches and ashtray ; he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanner . At about ten o'clock I checked to see that all the children were covered and asleep and that Toby was in his place on the bottom half of the double-decker . I then took two sleeping pills and went to sleep in my own bed in my own room . Because my husband was in the guest room I slept on his side of the bed , next to the bed table . I put my cigarettes and matches on the end table next to the ashtray , along with a small glass of brandy , which I find more efficacious than cough medicine . I woke up some time later to find Jannie standing beside the bed . " Ca n't sleep , " she said . " Want to come in your bed . " " Come along , " I said . " Bring your own pillow . " She went and got her pillow and her small pink blanket and her glass of fruit juice , which she put on the floor next to the bed , since she had gotten the side without anyend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her pink blanket , and Fell asleep . I went back to sleep , but sometime later the baby came in , asking sleepily , " Where 's Jannie ? " " She 's here , " I said . " Are you coming in bed with us ? " " Yes , " said the baby . " Go and get your pillow , then , " I said . She returned with her pillow , her books , her doll , her suitcase , and her fruit juice , which she put on the floor next to Jannie 's . Then she crowded in comfortably next to Jannie and fell asleep . Eventually the pressure of the two of them began to force me uneasily toward the edge of the bed , so I rolled out wearily , took any pillow and my small glass of brandy and my cigarettes and matches and my ashtray and went into the guest room , where my husband was asleep . I pushed at him and he snarled , but finally moved over to the side next to the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my ashtray on the end table next to his cigarettes and matches and ashtray and tin glass of water and put my pillow on the bed and fell asleep . Shortly after this he woke me and asked me to let him get out of the bed . since it was too hot in that room to sleep and he was going back to his own bed . He took his pillow and his cigarettes and matches and his ashtray and his tin glass of water and went padding off down the hall . In a few minutes Laurie came into the guest room where I had just fallen asleep again ; he was carrying his pillow and his glass of fruit juice . " Too cold in my room , " he said . and I moved out of the way and let him get into the bed on the side next to the wall . After a few minutes the dog came in , whining nervously , and came up onto the bed and curled himself up around Laurie , and I had to get out or be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , and made my way into my own room , where my husband was asleep with Jannie on one side and the baby on the other . Jannie woke up when I came in and said . " Own bed , " so I helped her carry her pillow and her fruit juice and her pink blanket back to her own bed . The minute Jannie got out of our bed the baby rolled over and turned sideways , so there was no room for me . I could not get into the crib and I could not climb into the top half of the double-decker so since the dog was in the guest room I went and took the blanket off the crib and got into the bottom half of the double-decker , setting my brandy and my cigarettes and matches and my ashtray on the floor next to the bed . Shortly after that Jannie , who apparently felt left out , came in with her pillow and her pink blanket and her fruit juice and got up into the top half of the double-decker , leaving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AT ABOUT six in the morning the dog wanted to get out , or else he wanted his bed back , because he came and stood next to me and howled . I got up and went downstairs , sneezing , and let him out , and then decided that since it had been so cold anyway in the bottom half of the double-decker I might as well stay downstairs and heat up some coffee and have that much warmth , at least . While I was waiting for the coffee to heat Jannie came to the top of the stairs and asked if I would bring her something hot , and I heard Laurie stirring in the guest room , so I heated some milk and put it into a jug and decided that while I was at it I might just as well give everybody something hot , so I set out enough cups for everyone and brought out a coffeecake and put it on the tray and added some onion rolls for my husband , who does not eat coffeecake . When I brought the tray upstairs Laurie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I set the tray down in there and heard baby talkino. from our room in the front . I went to getbher and she was sitting up in the bed talking to her father , who was only very slightly awake . " Play card ? " she was asking brightly , and she opened her suitcase and dealt him onto the pillow next to his nose four diamonds to the ace jack and the seven of clubs . I asked my husband if he would like some coffee and he said it was terribly cold . I suggested that he come down into the guest room , where it was warmer . He and the baby followed me down to the guest room and my husband and Laurie got into the bed and the rest of us sat on the foot of the bed and I poured the coffee and the hot milk and gave the children coffeecake and my husband the onion rolls . Jannie decided to take her milk and coffeecake back into her own bed and since she had mislaid her pillow she took one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , going first back into our room to pick up her pillow . My husband fell asleep again while I was pouring his coffee , and Laurie set his hot milk precariously on the headboard of the bed and asked me to get his pillow from wherever it was , so I went into the double-decker and got him the pillow from the top , which turned out to be Jannie 's , and her pink blanket was with it . I took my coffeecake and my coffee into my own bed and had just settled down when Laurie came in to say cloudily that Daddy had kicked him out of bed and could he stay in here ? I said of course and he said he would get a pillow and he came back in a minute with the one from the bottom half of the double-decker which was mine . He went to sleep right away , and then the baby came in to get her books and her suitcase and decided to stay with her milk and her coffee-cake so I left and went into the guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had my coffee . Meanwhile Jannie had moved into the top half of the double-decker , looking for her pillow , and had taken instead the pillow from baby 's bed and my glass of brandy and had settled down there to listen to Laurie 's radio . I went downstairs to let the dog in and he came upstairs and got into his bed on the bottom half of the double-decker and while I was gone my husband had moved back over onto the accessible side of the guest room bed so I went into Jannie 's bed , which is rather too short , and I brought a pillow from the guest room , and my coffee . At about nine o'clock the Sunday papers came and I went down to get them , and at about nine-thirty everyone woke up . My husband had moved back into his own bed when Laurie and Baby vacated it for their own beds , Laurie driving Jannie into the guest room when he took back the top half of the double-decker , and my husband woke up at nine-thirty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Laurie 's green pillow and with a piece of coffeecake and Baby 's fruit-juice glass , not to mention the four diamonds to the ace jack and the seven of clubs . Laurie in the top half of the MAGAZINE double-decker had my glass of brandy and my cigarettes and matches and the baby 's pink pillow . The dog had my white pillow and my ashtray . Jannie in the guest room had one white pillow and one blue pillow and two glasses of fruit juice and my husband 's cig arettes and matches and ashtray and Laurie 's hot milk , besides her own hot milk and coffeecake and her father 's onion rolls . The baby in her crib had her father 's tin glass of water and her suitcase and books and doll and a blue pillow from the guest room , but no blanket . The puzzle , is , of course , what became of the blanket from Baby 's bed ? I took it off her crib and put it on the bottom half of the double-decker , but the dog did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the other beds . It was a blue-patterned patchwork blanket , and has not been seen since , and I would most particularly like to know where it got to . As I say , we are very short of blankets .
