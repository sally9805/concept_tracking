" Dear Art Baker , " said a letter addressed to the M.C. of television 's You Asked for It . " I would like to have my son Gary shoot a television set on your show . Perhaps you think this is a strange request . . . " <P> Inured to stranger ones , Art Baker and his staff of 8 scarcely gave it a second thought . In their six months of operating You Asked for It ( broadcast from Los Angeles ' KTTV , fed to the nation a week later by Du Mont from New York ) , they have already shown , in response to requests : a one-armed paper hanger in action , a man fighting a bear , another wrestling an alligator , a boxer fighting a wrestler , a 600-lb. cowboy mounted on a luckless nag , a close-up of a lady swallowing swords , a swallower of goldfish , a Hopi Indian rain dance complete with rattlesnake , a scientist who showed ( with the help of liquid air at 300 F. below zero ) what the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week 's show , one " Cannonball " Martin came out of retirement to be pounded before the cameras with sledge hammers . <P> You Asked for It went on the air last January in Los Angeles , broadcasting pleasant sights such as $1,000,000 in cash ( $10 bills arranged in 25 stacks , each stack worth $40,000 ) . But it soon began to specialize in the dark , secret longings of its audience . Some longings that were too dark and secret to grant : several requests to see a man electrocuted ; a re-enactment of Joan of Arc burning at the stake , requested by a Minneapolis classroom ; a 60 m.p.h. head-on crash of two cars . <P> Baker , an ex-film character actor , decided not to let little Gary shoot up a TV set on the program . But there are plenty of other alarming requests to pick from . Some 2,000 come in every week , 45% of them from the not-so-innocent young . Last week Baker decided to gratify one of his most grisly requests to date , was going ahead with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " We 've got to be careful , " says he , " not to let the show degenerate into a simple variety show . " The tastes of the 1951 public being what they are , there seems to be little risk of that .
