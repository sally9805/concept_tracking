Amid the usual bacteriologist 's clutter on Dr. Frederick G. Novy 's laboratory bench at Ann Arbor was an unidentified virus which killed rats swiftly . Dr. Novy knew little more about it , but he had 25 test tubes of the virus , flourishing in rat blood . Then he moved his work from one lab to another and the test tubes vanished . That was in 1920 , and ever since , Dr. Novy has longed to know what happened to the virus . As the years passed , he was more &; more sure of one thing : if the tubes were ever found , the virus would be dead . <P> Last week the University of Michigan told a strange story . Workers cleaning out a lab found a bundle of test tubes . Inside was dried blood . Officials sent for Dr. Novy . Now 88 , he still carries his six-foot frame erect , talks and thinks fast . He took one look and exclaimed : " It 's a chance in a million , but I think those tubes contained my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the dried blood out of the tubes , so the lab ground up glass , blood and all into a powder , then added liquid and strained the mess . Dr. Novy was as amazed as everybody else when he found that the liquid contained live virus , still capable of killing rats after 30-odd years of desiccation . Now , with younger assistants , Dr. Novy is back at work trying to find out what the virus may mean to man . <P> Nobody knows for sure who mislaid the virus . But the university 's story has one odd twist : the tubes were found in a lab which had been used by Dr. Malcolm H. Soule , who committed suicide ( TIME , Aug. 13 , 1951 ) by injecting himself with snake venom .
