The Wild West ? Fact or Fantasy ? Bernard DeVoto Author of the Pulitzer Prise-winning histories " Across the Wide Missouri " and " The Year of Decision " Condensed from Holiday DURING a full century while it was being explored and settled , the West cast over the rest of the United States a spell of strangeness and wonder , of spectacle and adventure . It was seen through a mist of enchantment , a residue of which exists still in the minds of Easterners and Westerners alike . Here is a country of hard and restless men who tamed a continent  - -  of fur traders in buckskin pants , gold-rushers off to Californ-ni-ay , prospectors driving a burro across the desert in search of another Last Chance Gulch but destined to die of thirst short of the bonanza . It is the country of the covered wagon , the pony express , the overland stage , the Pacific Railroad , of Sitting Bull , Geronimo , the Little Big Horn . Finally , it is the country of the open range , the thundering herd and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the Western myth . Today dude ranches abound not only in the West but on Long Island , in the Berkshires and practically everywhere else . Your local newsstand stocks 20 pulp magazines devoted exclusively to cowboys wrecking barrooms , slugging sheriff , shooting rustlers and saving the fair damsel from the stampede . Your television station averages at least a dozen horse-opera movies a week , and every few minutes the local disk jockey sets some variant of Gene Autry to wailing some variant of " Tumblin ' Tumbleweed . " Small fry in Hopalong Cassidy outfits chase others in Lone Ranger outfits down your block , and will presently be washed with Hopalong soap and tucked away in Hopalong beds . Here is make-believe on a national scale . So far as it relates to reality at all , it dates back to a time period which lasted little more than 20 years and ended forever nearly 70 years ago . The period called the Cattle Kingdom began just after the Civil War , when herds of Texas longhorns were driven north to the new railroads that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the untouched ranges in Wyoming and Montana and the equally empty ones of New Mexico and Arizona . No matter what the ostensible date of a horse opera may be , its plot , emotions , conventions and cliches all relate to this brief time . Nature rang down the curtain on this era when the winter of 1886-87 killed hundreds of thousands of cattle , bankrupted innumerable outfits and changed the stock business forever . But it was already in the process of being changed forever . It could exist only because of the open range , which belonged to the people of the United States ; and they were now taking it away from the barons and bronzed horsemen . Homesteaders ( the " nesters " of the pulps ) and barbed wire were already strangling the Cattle Kingdom when the winter of the big freeze came . No one can explain why the United States has chosen this aspect of the West to romanticize into a myth . True , there was abundant gunfire ( though hardly a tenth part of what goes out by coaxial cab every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other business method , which is what it was . The big outfit shot up the little outfit get rid of competition for the ran Big and little outfits ganged up shoot sheepmen , who had no damn right to the range which the bronze horsemen were stealing from t Government . The gunmen who d ' most of the shooting , and who a the Robin Hoods of the balladry were hired thugs , indistinguishable from metropolitan hoods of today and equally repulsive . The cowboy 's trade required ski courage and endurance ? but so d ' all frontier occupations , whether felling white pine in Wisconsin or taking a broadhorn down the Ohio . H life was dangerous and full of hard ship ? but life was that way in a frontier environments . ( For squat and unregarded suffering , take the first few winters at any mining camp from Bannack to Leadville , with the rat-gnawed corpses of drunks an paupers dragged from canvas huts when the snows melted . ) The cowboy seems an illogic choice as a master symbol of th West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rocky Mountain trapper of an earlier day would have served better , for his was the most complex skill ever exercised on this continent . If importance for the future makes a culture hero , then it should have been the homesteader , y Ito brought the country in and created the Vest of today . Finally , the cowboy image is in great part phon , a counterfeit , and concentration on it obscures the rich diversity of the West . Past or present , there is a lot more to the West than cow outfit . " THE WEST " encompasses 40 percent of the area of the United States - a . great variety of landscapes and Z people . What , for instance , have lies City and Santa Fe in common ? Miles City was settled in the late 1 8 7 o 's in the high plains where ' Tongue River reaches the Yellowtone . Vastness is on all sides of it ; t is immensely western , an explosion of trees planted to make a refuge for minds strained by sun and wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat country oil country and badlands . Santa Fe , also typically western , is set in a mountain basin 7000 feel high and ringed with higher peaks It was a Spanish town ten years before the Mayflower anchored in Plymouth harbor . Mexican Spanish is heard as commonly as English on its streets , and the Pueblo Indian tongues almost as often . Cattle ranching means lattle to it and oil wells less , but silversmiths , anathropologists , poets and painters are dirt-common . Abundant contrast and yet only two towns . Now bring in Denver , the Salt Lake Tabernacle , San I ) i ego , the Top of the Mark , Port Link skid road , Tom Campbell 's wheat ranches , the atomic secrecies of Ilan ford , the cotton fields along the Gila and the wetbacks who work them , 425,000 acres of orchards in California 's Central Valley . Can any pattern be traced through so much contrast ? Easily enough , but you must take paradox in your stride . In the West it is always a long way from here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness ? to mountains or deserts . The scale is so large that Westerners have developed a new sense of space and time . At home in Cambridge , Mass. , I hesitate before accepting an invitation to dinner in Concord 15 miles away . In Santa Fe a woman looks up from the Denver Post with a gleam in her eyes and says that Denver Dry Goods is having a sale on blouses . It is 367 miles to Denver but a one-day round trip to save $t.19 is nothing . Similarly Los Angelenos drive 290 miles to Las Vegas for a whirl at the gambling tables . Over a holiday , Wyoming trout streams are populous with San Franciscans . Most Westerners spend a large part of their lives in the outdoors . The cult of the sun has been most publicized in Southern California ? " Great , tall , empty , sunburned blondes , " a resented poem runs ? but it exists everywhere . In the Sierra and every other range , adolescents and their grandparents burn their skins black , fishing , hunting , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A great many people , down to the humblest income bracket , own a shack in the mountains for week-ends and holidays . Thus Westerners retain what was once the birthright of all Americans : a full awareness of the forms and processes of nature , the weather , the growing seasons , the web of life . Nature is an integral part of one 's daily life . A lawyer studies the life cycle of rattlesnakes ; a Latin teacher photographs cloud forms ; a train dispatcher corrects beetle taxonomy . A western professional class who work in the open geologists , engineers , hydrologists , biologists ? are a striking mixture of scientist and frontiersman . They perform fastidious experiments in laboratories too miles square , report them unintelligibly in professional quarterlies and could never be induced to forsake the mountains for the universities . Make a nooning with such a man and listen to him on the West 's bestiary . There is the fur-bearing trout of the Idaho lakes , for instance , and the hootpecker , a cross between the woodpecker and the owl which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be waged on a round-the-clock basis . Such men preserve a valuable and authe tic part of the true Old West as di . tinguished from Frontier Week . WESTERN LIFE is maintained as precarious victory over an enem , who always has heavy armor in re serve . This is a country of droughts blizzards , sandstorms , cloudbursts twisters . This year you get a bonanza crop , buy a Cadillac , spend the win ter in San Diego . Next year there i no rain , and the sun is a sickly greet , disk behind a cloud of dust three miles high . Dust piles " round fence posts in rippled cones ; a crop is just a few brown shoots sticking through it ; you throw some bedding in a truck and the bank takes over . Down a gulch that has been dry for a decade comes a 4o-foot wall of t water from a cloudburst 4o miles away , with somebody 's corral posts and drowned steers floating on top of it . Or the cloudburst hits an overgrazed spot on a mountainside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river of thick mud . It pours out of the canyon and buries fields and orchards under ten feet of ; ravel and boulders that weigh up : 0 30o tons . Violence and chance have necessarily been the themes of the West 's way of life . Every effort was a gamble . The Government bet you a pat-ter section that you could n't have on it for five years . You bet your pile and , not infrequently , your life hat there was gold in the gravel that you would strike water before he drill broke , or oil before you it broke . That the price of wheat or cattle would hold . It is the gambler 's buoyancy that ih Easterner sees as western breeziThere were never any servants i he West , no caste barriers except II as are erected by the West 's i t wriest rich . ( The waitress calls our wife " honey " and is genuinely eager to please you . The bellboy contilts you about his problems as a re-medic at State U. ) Here is one part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the world or half-paralyzed by vague fears of Russia . It is the United States as we knew it in a more vigorous time . Or a more youthful time . WHAT MAY ESCAPE observation at first is the Westerner as schizophrenic . Never did the pillar of cloud move so constantly before Moses as the vision of E1 Dorado before the West . The boomer is a man who looks at a solitary water tank or grain elevator beside a railroad track and sees a metropolis-to-be , who glances from a sagebrush flat to the snowy peaks on the horizon whence water might be brought and sees the garden of the world flowering at his feet . The other half is the boom going bust ? the dry well , the bluesky promotion , the salted claim . The collapse of the boom is the very essence of western experience ? and yet the essence of the western character has always been the conviction that tomorrow is another day . Last time the vein pinched out , or the locusts came . But next time you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try again somewhere else . During the past 30 years enormous dams and gigantic systems of water distribution have literally remade the West and launched it on its greatest boom . At the same time the West has become more suave . The practice of the arts , which for generations was tolerated only in San Francisco and Cannel , has proliferated amazingly . There are painters everywhere now , not merely at Taos . In a dozen places superb ceramics are being made . There are a dozen symphony orchestras , and few towns are too small to have a choral society and a chamber-music group . Every second Westerner is writing a novel . Such are the stresses and ferments at work on the West . They account for the vivacity and volatility of an engaging people , whose spirit is a blend of pure credulity , pure cynicism and illusion . But there enters in , too , awareness of almost incredible achievement . Properly speaking , the West was uninhabitable . And yet there it is in plain view , the garden of the world . Westerners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but therefore also be wary . For who knows whether the hills at the horizon are real or a mirage ? They are self-assured because they have subdued the unsubduable , so that the best symbol for them is the big dam which stores the water which creates life . And they are skeptical because the dam is a frail thing and will be no more substantial than the mirage if the rains fail . It is an old saying that Americans love a hard country . But the , West must be loved as you love a woman you know you can not trust . Or maybe , since so much of their country is fabulous , the right word for Westerners is fable . Space , yo learn out West , has color . The color of space is deep blue turning lavender and darkening to violet . Yo can see it any autumn morning in any mountain range , any evenings in any desert , or at any hour in any of the chasms of which the Grand Canyon is the best known . A blue gauze is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color changes , and you are n't seeing what you lately saw , or you saw what was n't there . Maybe the West has provided its own best fable . It is older than the white man 's West ; it has been told in many Indian tongues about many streams . If you drink of Fountain Creek , which issues from big springs called Manitou in a gulch above Colorado Springs , it has been said that the spell is on you thenceforth . Wherever you go , you will come back to drink that water again .
