Our gamble paid off handsomely . Six of us solved the enigma of Yerupaja last summer , in storm and gale , on sheer slopes of ice , with the rumble of avalanches to warn us of our deadly peril . Every man in our party of Americans got within striking distance of the summit , though only two of them were able to make the final climb . They reached the top , a tiny platform of snow just large enough for one man at a time , in gathering dusk on July thirty-first . The Butcher was beaten , but he still had a price to exact from us . In terms of what the human body and mind can stand , that price was pretty high . We almost left two corpses behind to justify his nickname . To assess the cost properly , picture Dave Harrah tumbling over the edge of a 4000-foot precipice , dangling for minutes at the end of a rope as taut as a bowstring , and then struggling half dazed up a wall of ice to safety on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left the topmost pinnacle of Yerupaja . At the other end of his rope , 120 feet away , was Jim Maxwell , his companion on the last lap of the climb . If Jim had been yanked loose  --  and he nearly was  --  both men would have plummeted through space to certain death on the glaciers below . Yankee luck was with them , and they needed it , for The Butcher also had his eye on Jim . Minutes later , Jim broke through a thin strip of snow , with nothing but air beneath it . He jumped back just in time to save himself . By now , the wind was rising and pitch-blackness was closing in as Dave and Jim struggled down the long rooftop of Yerupaja , finally huddling together , exhausted , in a tiny cave in the snow . The next morning , with feet frozen nearly solid , they stumbled down to warmth and shelter at High Camp , our topmost tent pitched on a narrow shelf of ice nearly four miles up in the sky . But we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were safe . You might assume , after finishing this catalogue of horrors , that The Butcher had been paid in full . Dave and Jim know otherwise . Dark-haired Dave , a Stanford University senior , has lost all the toes on both his feet . Jim , a senior in geophysics at Harvard , spent two months in Lima and Boston hospitals recuperating from frostbite . Doctors had to cut away parts of almost every toe . It was a costly trip for Dave and Jim , but they figure it could have been much more expensive . After all , you can still go mountain climbing without toes . As for the rest of us , the four other members of the Harvard Andean Expedition of 1950 , we 're more than satisfied with the way our gamble paid off . We four did n't get to the top , it 's true . To climb a mountain such as Yerupaja is a stupendous and exhausting job . With a difference in elevation of 8300 feet between the base and the summit , we were lucky that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mission . We four lowlanders , functioning like quartermaster troops with a combat division , formed a human chain . All of us packed up food , tents , sleeping bags and stoves so our summit climbers could start their assault as close as possible to their goal , and return to shelter the same day . We had five tent camps on the slopes ? of Yerupaja . The lowest was at 13,400 feet above sea level , almost the height of the Grand Teton , in Wyoming . The topmost , nestling under an overhanging lip of ice that threatened to break loose at any minute , was at 20,600 feet , leas than a quarter mile from the final pyramid of Yerupaja . We troops in the supply echelon did n't get off scot free . I contracted a fever , a temperature of 102 degrees , that forced me to turn back after starting with Dave for the top . Intestinal infections , fever or both sapped the resistance of the other three men ?

Boulder ( 1 ) , Glacier ( 2 ) , Col ( 3 ) and High ( 1 ) . best to relive  --  the next day , August second , when we worked our way high up the glacier on the western face of Yerupaja , with clouds above , but sunlight below . We almost gave up hope as the day dragged on . Then , late in the afternoon , we suddenly heard Dave 's hoarse " Help ! Help ! Help ! " and realized that he was still alive , though in need of aid . That was a heart-stopping moment . For sheer satisfaction , it still ranks above the later moment when Dave and Jim , stumbling down through shattered blocks of ice to join us below High Camp , confirmed what we had hoped for . They had climbed Yerupaja . You may wonder why we set such store by this mountain  --  why any mountaineer wants to climb a peak that no one else has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mountaineer is a gourmet . A virgin peak to him is like a new masterpiece of cooking to a man who fancies good food . Every climber with experience on big mountains  --  and there are a lot of such men ? has a mental list of the untouched summits of this world . Very often , a good many Alpinists will be thinking of climbing the same peak . That happened to be the case with all six of us . Just to show you how we got the idea  --  almost by osmosis , you might say ? I will cite the example of Maxwell , Matthews and myself . We had been climbing together for three years as members of the Harvard Mountaineering Club . I graduated from Harvard in 1947 and went on to Cornell University to do research in physics , but I still kept up my mountaineering friendships . In the summer of 1948 , the three of us made a trip to the Coast mountains of British Columbia  --  a wild , remote and thoroughly tempting chain of mountains . We spent our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about the last great summits still to be climbed . A Harvard mountaineer , Bill Jenks , had worked for the Cerro de Pasco mines in Peru , and had carefully compiled a list of Peruvian peaks not yet conquered , among them Yerupaja . We discussed that mountain rather wistfully , and then let the subject drop . Peru seemed too far away . The idea had taken root , however , and it kept on growing . On a visit to Harvard , I chatted with Austen Riggs . J Sure enough , Yerupaja was on his mind , but we figured the cost to us would be prohibitive  --  more than $1200 per man to fly to Peru , pack 100 miles into the interior to the foot of Yerupaja , make an assault on the peak , and then fly back again . Just the same , I could n't help hoping . The literature about Yerupaja was scanty , but I accumulated all there was . An Austrian expedition had first visited the Cordillera de Huayhtiash , a mountain range which includes Yerupaja , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Doctor Kinzl , made a detailed map of the area . Two other members of the expedition , Erwin Schneider and Arnold Awerzger , battled their way to the summits of Siula ( 20,800 feet ) and Rassac ( 19,800 feet ) , but Yerupaja was too much for them . They made two bold attempts on that glittering mountain , reaching 20,000 feet on the southwestern ridge of Yerupaja , and then turned back defeated . Schneider , at least , was hopeful . He believed that a strong party probably could climb the peak by following its southwestern ridge , and by this route alone . As for other climbers  --  Americans and Europeans who looked at Yerupaja from a distance , reconnoitered its foothills and launched abortive attempts on the summit itself between 1937 and 1948 ? their reports were uniformly intriguing . One veteran of the Himalayas called the mountain " the Peruvian Matterhorn , " a reference to the Swiss peak which rebuffed all climbers until 1865 , and has killed so many of them since . The late Frank S. Smythe , a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have said : " First climb Kanchanjanga , then Yerupaja . " That was chilling advice , since Kanchanjanga , one of the great Himalayan summits , is 28,146 feet high , the third highest mountain in the world , and probably more formidable than Everest . Nobody ever has climbed it , and there is some doubt that anybody ever will . Maybe , in view of all this , I was foolish to keep harping on the subject of Yerupaja , but that 's the way mountains get climbed . Somebody will say that a peak is impossible , and immediately a bunch of stubborn men will set out to prove the statement wrong . All through the fall of 1949 , Austen and I amassed information . We located some exceptional aerial photos taken by a Swiss geologist , Arnold Heim , a copy of a report by Kinzl and Schneider , and every available statistic on the cost of a first-class climbing expedition . By Christmas , 1949 , we dreamers were about ready to take the plunge . We had pared our estimated costs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved up the money , and all we needed was two more climbers to bring our number to six . That 's the Rafe minimum for a really big climb . Riggs , Matthews , Maxwell and I were committed to the trip . I then wrote Bob McCarter , an old Harvard man , studying at Stanford Business School , and invited him to come along . That was how Harrah and Crush came to join us . McCarter , to our regret , was unable to take on any climbing during the summer of 1950 . Since he could n't come , he recommended Harrah , and Harrah in turn recommended Crush . They were strangers to us , but we knew them as first-class men . Harrah , who is only twenty-four , had been climbing in the Cascade Mountains since the age of thirteen , and thinking about such mountains as Yerupaja almost that long . Crush was a veteran of some spectacular rock climbs in the Sierra Nevada . A mature thirty-one , he was by far the oldest of our crew . I 'm twenty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riggs twenty-five . All of us , by the way , are single men . Climbers who marry , I have found , develop a distaste for really interesting ascents . Either that , or their wives sensibly develop it for them . During the winter of 1949 we could n't run up and down any big mountains , so we kept ourselves in shape by a variety of home-grown expedients . I live 150 vertical feet below Rockefeller Hall , the physics building on the Cornell campus , so I ran up the hill to classes and down again each night . Harrah did his leg work on the steps in the Stanford Stadium . Riggs rode a bicycle two miles a day ; Crush worked out with bar bells and weights ; Maxwell had a part-time job as a tree surgeon , which is one efficient way of getting used to heights , and Matthews took long hikes . This was n't very elaborate or formal training , but it seemed to do the trick , and it was in tune with the philosophy behind our expedition . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We did n't even choose a leader , an omission which would make some of the great Everest climbers turn over in their graves . Each man took his own clothes , climbing boots , ice axes and crampons . Crampons are steel spikes , usually ten or a dozen of them , set in a metal framework . This framework can be fitted over the soles of climbing boots , strapped on tightly and used whenever ice or hard snow has to be ascended . Where boots would slip , the crampon spikes hold firm . As for food . usually the subject of much debate and calorie figuring on Alpine expeditions , Riggs and I worked it out over a few cups of coffee . Including a thousand feet of nylon rope , our food and equipment weighed 1500 pounds . It cost us $200 to ship the tot to Peru . We took only one formal step , and that was a wise one . We secured the sponsorship of the Institute of Geographical Exploration of Harvard University . Thathelped immensely in smoothing our way with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind as well as the climbing . To make our climb , we had to hit Peru during the dry season , which extends from June to September . Riggs and I arrived by plane on June thirteenth  --  treated , en route , to a spectacular view of Yerupaja , towering above its surrounding peaks 100 miles north of Lima . It looked awfully cold and awfully far away . By the twenty-third of June all of us were assembled in Lima . After a bitter struggle with Peruvian red tape , we got our food out of customs  --  the importation of foodstuffs being strictly forbidden , due to the shortage of dollars in the country . We added two caretakers for our Base Camp , Don Juan Ormea , an ornithologist at the Peruvian National University , and his son , Tomas , an expert at bagging birds . Jack Sack , a reporter for the Harvard Crimson , came along to help set up a two-way radio which was to keep us in touch with Lima ? and which actually worked for ten seconds all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lima , where he spent days vainly awaiting word of our progress and finally had to come in to base camp for news . The Butcher was still a long way from us , but his defenses extended far down toward the coast . We penetrated the first of them , in the two-and-ahalf-ton truck we had borrowed from a United States Army mission at Lima . We had to pass through a valley infested with a deadly , localized disease known as verruga peruana . Five thousand construction workers on the Central Railway of Peru perished of this disease  --  a particularly unpleasant one which causes the lymph glands to swell up , produces excruciating pain , and finally death within a few days . Natives are immune , but foreigners almost invariably succumb . The bacteria are carried by a tiny , almost invisible sand fly which is abroad only during a few hours after sunrise and before sunset . Just as we were well into the area , our fan belt broke . We had no spare . We frantically thumbed down every passing vehicle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day was wearing on , the time for the flies to come out was approaching , and we were still staggering along the valley floor . We would chug up a steep grade for half a mile , and then wait fifteen minutes or the boiling engine to cool . Often one of us would sit on the hood of the truck , reporting on the state of the engine . " It is n't boiling any more , " an observer finally called back cheerily . He was right . It was n't boiling any more , because it was out of water . We got just to the edge of the valley , having taken eight hours for the trip and having exposed ourselves to every fly in the countryside , when the motor finally quit . We spent the whole night of June twenty-seventh in a 14,000-foot pass , expecting any minute to feel the first symptoms of verruga peruana , and not until the evening of June twenty-eighth did we approach road 's end at the town of Chiquidn , twenty miles west of Yerupaja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us contracted verruga peruana , though all of us save Austen and Graham had picked up some other kind of a bug and ran fevers between 100 and 103 . At last , on July third , after recuperating in Chiquiiin , we managed to gather together seventeen burros and set out for the base of Yerupaja up a narrow mountain trail . It took us two days to cover twenty-five trail miles , and we had gone as far as our animals could . We decided to set up our Base Camp there , at 13,400 feet . It was a magnificent site . We pitched three tents at the upper end of Lake Jahuacocha . Above us loomed the awe-inspiring ice horn of Nevado Jirishanca ( 20,000 feet ) and the terrible precipices of Nevado Rondoy ( 19,300 feet ) with only the summit of Yerupaja peeping out over the tumbled rocks of Rassac Ridge . Nowhere in the great central backbone of this Cordillera do the connecting ridges drop below 18,500 feet . This is undoubtedly the most formidable chain of peaks in the world , excluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther to the north , is child 's play , by comparison  --  or woman 's play , since the first ascent is reported to have been made by Annie Smith Peck , a Smith College professor , in 1908 . The mountains were impressive enough , but what really gave us pause was the cornices that adorned them , some of the most monstrous to be found in any mountain area . Great scrolls of snow and ice , built by winds blowing steadily from the Amazon Basin , they had formed on the lee , or western , sides of the ridges . Some of them projected horizontally more than 100 feet into the blue mountain air  --  millions of tons of snow , supported only on the inner side , ready to break loose without warning . Take a look at the cornice on any office building . Imagine that it 's constructed of insubstantial snow instead of well-cemented stone , and you 'll understand why we had some prayerful thoughts . To climb Yerupaja , we first would have to spend days beneath these horrors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man 's weight can bring down a cornice in a flash . You have to guess where the rock of the ridge begins , and try to follow that invisible line . If you fail ? well , that 's why Dave Harrah nearly fell to his death , and why Jim Maxwell had to jump to save his own life . Cornices were to blame in both cases . So , before we started to climb , we looked hard at the cornices , and we looked at the ice avalanches thundering down over the precipices of Rondoy , and at night , when we could not see them , we could still hear them . Big mountains , such as Yerupaja , often are walled off by lesser peaks . We had to surmount the north ridge of Rassac Peak , which lay between us and our destination , in order to get to the base of the southwestern ridge of Yerupaja , the only one deemed safe for an ascent . That involved a 5000-foot climb in five miles . It sounds simple , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules could travel still higher than our first pack train had gone  --  fresh mules , accustomed to picking their way along narrow mountain paths . Dave and Austen found a way , and we were able on July ninth to take three strong mules and their owner , Naptali Sombrano , up nearly to a pocket of boulders and grass at 15,200 feet on the side of Rassac Ridge . Here we established Boulder Camp . Reconnaissance had located a continuation of our route , through broken cliffs and ledges , high above the glacial waters of Laguna Solterahanca , to the floor of the great northwestern glacier of Yerupaja . We were so bucked up by our prospects that we neglected to pitch a tent , so the result was that it snowed an inch that night . We were three cold and wet climbers ? Dave . Graham Matthews and I. Dave and I pulled out at 8:30 on the morning of July tenth , carrying all that would be needed to establish our next highest camp ? a two-man tent , two sleeping bags , air mattresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of that long and tedious search for routes that always slows up an expedition . In the movies a group of mountain climbers may start right up a mountain without worrying about preliminaries . In real life you have to spend days working out your route , toting loads that almost break your back , and sitting out stormy weather in glum boredom far lower down the mountain than you 'd Iike to be . It was that way on Rassac , a thoroughly nasty sort of ridge chopped up into minor peaks , gulleys and tilted cliffs . It took us six hours to find our way through these , marking a route with piles of stones to indicate the way to those who would follow . We came out around the edge of the ridge and found a good site for our next camp at 16,100-feet elevation . Climbers get a special reward in the form of scenery nobody else ever sees from close up , and Glacier Camp was worth all the effort it took . We were actually high above the glacier , looking out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dave was to develop a theory that you should eat a limited diet at high altitudes  --  such dismal things as crackers and jam , hot tea and cereal . But , inspired by the view and optimistic , we dined that night on canned veal , baby beef liver , Finnish cheese and mincemeat . Theory or no , we had seen to it that there was plenty to eat . The following morning , July eleventh , we worked our way half a mile and 800 feet upward through broken cliffs to make sure that a route could be forced onto the glacier and above to the base of the southwestern ridge . What we saw was encouraging , but what we found when we returned to Boulder Camp was discouraging . Graham was feverish , too weak even to descend to Base Camp . Chuck Crush was too worn out by his fever to go higher , and Jim was determined to stay below and establish radio communication with Lima , sharing Base Camp with ailing Austen . Thus it was up to Dave and me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cola low pass at the bottom of the southwestern ridge . On the morning of July twelfth , with another camp on our backs , we set off over the ridge and reached Glacier Camp in about three hours . We slept there - the night of the twelfth , and the next day climbed out onto the shattered , broken floor of the glacier , first putting on crampons , tying ourselves together with 150 feet of nylon rope and unsheathing our ice axes . Our point of contact with the glacier was near the top of an icefall . A glacier , after all , is a river of ice moving slowly downhill , perhaps only a few feet a year . When a river drops down a steep incline , you have rapids or waterfalls . When a glacier does the same thing , you have an icefall . Great towers of ice hung over our heads as we climbed . Deep crevasses , yawning chasms in the snow so deep that we could n't see to the bottom of them , made us move with caution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged on a relatively level snowfield leading up to the col , like a huge and snowy lap rug on the mountainside . Above us hung the cornices on the giant western face of Yerupaja . At one point a mammoth section of the face itself had given way . A million or more tons of ice had swept down across the floor of the snowfield . It had happened once , and it could happen again . Under a withering sun , we kept on slogging upward . Great blocks of ice stuck out of the snow ? chunks that could have crushed a man as if be were a fly . These had slid down from above . The rising sun , melting the ice , might bring more of them on our heads , but there was no other way up . It was not until 2:30 P.M. that we finally reached the col at 18,800 feet . When you are carrying forty pounds on your back , after that sort of trip ? with the constant prospect of ice tumbling down from above , and with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and take a long rest . Which we did . The south side of the col was alarmingly steep and the snow was soft and treacherous . We found a better spot , considering our limited choice , some twenty feet below and to the north of a crest . Here was a bergschrund , a cleft in the ice which is always found at the upper end of a glacier . The snow below a bergschrund moves downhill , though slowly . The snow above , replenished by frequent storms , stays firmly in place , and the result is a crack . The upper lip of the hergschrund , a projecting piece of ice , had fallen in at one spot , filling the cleft and providing a site for a tent . At one side , however , a mass of ice towered out above us . Dave bet me that the bottom would drop out before the top fell in , but I wagered on the multi-ton sword of Damocles over my head . Both of them creaked all night as we tried to sleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wager . Psychologically , we were all set to climb the mountain as soon as we set up one higher camp . The Butcher , however , had other plans for us . Sickness continued to dog our footsteps . I struggled down to Base Camp on July fifteenth with a high fever . By the seventeenth all our camps were well stocked with food , but one obstacle after another kept us from moving on up the mountain . Gusts of wind screamed around the col , rattling the tent , sometimes blowing at an estimated eighty miles an hour . Dave contracted indigestion , and Austen Riggs , six feet seven inches tall , was having trouble maintaining circulation of the blood through his great length . Three times Dave and Austen tried to start up the mountain , and got nowhere . Finally , on July twentieth , Dave carried two loads up about 600 feet above camp . The next day , reasonably well recovered , I went up to rejoin Dave at Col Camp . The strong winds had died down and everything seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked our way up to the two loads , climbing that far without a rope . Above us , the whole mountainside was a mass of crevasses , spidery lines in the snow . Overhanging and unstable cliffs of ice loomed above us , but none of them had fallen during Dave 's stay at Col Camp . so we climbed with confidence . It was good footing , but as steep as a barn roof . We were traversing , moving diagonally across the slope , and we had to place our crampons with care , bending our ankles outward so that our bodies remained vertical while our feet assumed the same angle as the snow . That 's a trick of climbers , and it certainly worked for us . The temptation , on a steep slope , is to lean inward , an almost sure way of guaranteeing a slip . We held our ice axes between us and the slope , using them for balance . In case of a possible slip , we could dig in the sharp point at the lower end of the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , if that did n't work and we began to slide , we could reverse the ax and dig in the curving , pointed head of the ax . An ice ax is built for such emergencies . The head of the ax , on one side , is shaped like an adz , for scooping footsteps in hard snow . The other side comes to a point , for chopping steps in ice . This sort of climbing might frighten the wits out of an inexperienced man , but we were used to it from our past experiences in the West . By noon , threading our way upward , we reached a level space barely large enough for a tent . Below , the snow dropped away steeply ; above , an overhang of ice bulged out about five feet . Dave , emulating a human fly , swarmed up alongside this overhang , drove a tubular ice piton ? a round metal spike , hollow inside , which freezes solidly into the ice  --  attached the rope to it and slid down to our platform . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing to do at this altitude . We were 20,600 feet up in the sky , and about 400 feet below the crest of the Yerupaja ridge , a long knife edge leading toward the summit . Shortly after dawn , well chilled by a sleepless night , Dave and I started up toward the summit . Since we had not eaten for twenty-four hours , it took me only a few minutes to realize that I could n't make it ; that I would have to replenish my strength with food and drink below . At Col Camp I was glad to turn over my end of the rope to Jim Maxwell , who was feeling fine . I managed to get down to Glacier Camp , but for several days Dave and Jim were pinned down by high winds and snow . The Butcher was brewing more trouble . On July twenty-eighth , we could see them advancing over the west face from Col Camp toward High Camp , and then there was no sign of activity until July thirtieth . The winds blew up as they climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to their tiny tent . The mountain , it seemed , was playing cat and mouse with us . I was alone at Glacier Camp . Above me the wind was thundering continuously , and the clouds were tearing themselves to fragments on the great peaks . But at 0:00 A.M. on July thirty-first I caught sight of the climbers . Nearly a vertical mile above me , I saw two figures moving upward . The final bid for the summit was now under way . The climbers continued upward . As they hacked their way up the last ice cliff before the crest of the ridge , the clouds swept down and swallowed them . Above 20,000 feet , the storm had spread its great gray wings . And then it was night and there was nothing to do but wait . Chuck , Austen , Graham and I were by now sharing two tents at Glacier Camp . " Something is wrong , " we decided late the next day , when we still saw no sign of anyone descending to High Camp . " Tomorrow morning we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can raise anyone by shouting . If not , two of us will go up to Col Camp and spend the night there . Next day the col party will go on to High Camp . They can display an orange flag if they need more help . The rest of us will watch from below . " ' The next morning we climbed slowly up the glacier . Clouds still scudded across the peak . We shouted . There was no answer except the muttering of the wind and the echoes from the ice walls . There were tracks of new avalanches across the route between Col and High camps . Could they have been trapped , Pat  --  srary 13 , 1951 in a sudden fall of snow and ice ? We went on up the glacier and shouted again . This time we could hear a muffled reply . At least we thought we could . We passed almost directly under High Camp and shouted once more . The wind died down for a minute , and this time we could hear clearly . It was Dave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He repeated his call three times . That 's the international distress signal , in use universally among experienced mountaineers . " We 're coming ! " we shouted back . There was no time to lose . Chuck , we decided , would stay on the glacier to watch for anyone coming down from above . Austen Riggs would go up to Col Camp and keep hot tea brewing . Graham Matthews and I would stop at Col Camp for the night and go on to High Camp the following morning . We hurried up to the col , and were just finishing supper when suddenly we heard the cry for help again . Slowly and painfully , Dave and Jim were descending from above on frozen feet . They were shattered men . " We 've got to get down to Glacier Camp tonight , " Dave was almost sobbing when we reached him . " We 've got to get off the glacier tonight . If we ever take our boots off , we 'll never get them back on . We 've got to get down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was convinced that he was going to lose both feet . Jim was worn out . He could n't face the trip to Glacier Camp . So I descended with him to Col Camp , while Dave hobbled painfully on to Glacier Camp with Austen and Graham . That evening , for the first time since we reached the Cordillera , the sunset was a bloody red . In the darkness that followed , Jim told of the climb . It was relatively easy , he said , until they reached the top of the summit ridge . The giant cornice , which draped itself out over the western face , had split at the crest of the ridge , opening a crack 30 to 100 feet deep . The climbers had no choice . They descended into its depths . Sometimes the crack was wide above them . At other times it narrowed and closed over them , and they advanced through a tunnel . Great masses of ice had fallen in from above , and these had to be climbed over . Once Jim dropped through the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a desperate effort , and then looked down into the hole . Below him was only inky blackness . Finally , this nightmare crack ended and they emerged on a ridge twentyfive feet wide , walking on top of the cornice , trying to stay on the line of the ridge . Through the mists there loomed up a giant pyramid , 300 feet high , plastered with thin ice and loose snow , an almost impossible obstacle . But there was a way out . Along the extreme left edge of the tower there was a small rock rib covered with snow , poised over the dizzy slopes of the western face . It was n't a safe route , but when you 're trying to bag such a summit you have to take chances . Very deliberately and very slowly , they made their way up this rib . Dave was ahead , whenever possible braced , with the rope around his hips , to hold Jim in case of a slip . In cold fact , if Jim had fallen , Dave would have been yanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpened . Slopes of smooth ice and jagged rock fell off at sixty to seventy degrees from the horizontal . Tiny cornices protruded over the edge of these walls . By comparison with the pyramid it was a stroll to the summit . At five in the afternoon , they reached their objective . It had taken seven hours to go less than a quarter mile . I have said we were an informal party . We deliberately neglected one of the formalities dear to the heart of mountain expeditions . It is customary to unfurl a flag , the national emblem of your particular country , when you reach a virgin summit . The Nazis were great hands for that , always taking pains to tote with them a swastika flag of prodigious size . We did n't even send along a flag the size of a pocket handkerchief with Dave and Jim . We did n't have one to send . We were climbing Yerupaja as sportsmen , not as representatives of the U.S.A. , but the mountain staged its own display for us . Just as Dave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped below the crest . They could see the whole Cordillera . They shook hands solemnly , took a few photographs and started back down the ridge . Jim Maxwell is an amateur cameraman , and a bug on high-altitude pictures . I do n't blame him for that , although his zeal for photography nearly killed him . A hundred feet down the ridge , Maxwell paused for a picture . Generally , in a delicate spot such as the ridge of Yerupaja , the climbers belay each other . In other words , at least one of them is braced to hold his companion in case of a slip . Both Dave and Jim were tired and in a hurry . Harrah did n't bother to jam his ice ax into the snow or to wind his climbing rope around it . That would have secured Jim against a slip and possibly made life pleasanter for Dave a moment later . " I heard a cracking sound , " Dave told me . " I saw the snow open between my feet and felt myself hurtling down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die , ' I thought . I had lime , though , for a f6w reflections on the concept of hubris , the ancient Greek concept of wanton disregard of natural order which plunges a man to doom . These reflections lasted only a second . Then I felt three awful squeezes around my middle , where I was tied to the rope , one squeeze after the other . I was a ball at the end of more than 120 feet of elastic nylon , bouncing up and down . " My ribs felt like jackstraws . Jim shouted that he could not help me . I climbed ten feet straight up on the rope until I could reach a ledge , and then I spent the best years of my youth clawing my way back up the ice slope . With one hand I dug my ice ax into the rubbery ice . With the other I hooked onto tiny projections with an ice hammer , which has a hook on one side . I ' do n't know how long it took me to crawl over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What happened above as Harrah tumbled through the cornice ? " I saw the snow give way , " Maxwell told me . " I grabbed up my ice ax , took a couple of steps over the top of the ridge , flopped down in the snow there , drove my ice ax into the snow , put one hand on the ax to brace myself , and then felt the first of three violent tugs . I could n't have held on if there had been a fourth tug . I would have gone over the edge too . What saved us both , I guess , was the fact that the rope cut a deep gash in the snow on the ridge . That took some of the dead weight of Dave 's body off me and absorbed the worst of his bounces . " Fifty feet farther down the ridge it was Maxwell 's turn . He put one foot onto a hidden cornice . The snow broke from under his foot , and he jumped back just in time . By then both climbers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashlight and they had to move with painful slowness . At midnight they were only at the western end of the ridge , unable to go farther or to find their way down to High Camp . They crawled under a chock stone , a block of ice wedged into the great cleft on the summit ridge . There was space enough to curl up there . Dave thawed his socks over a candle flame , while chatting cheerfully about the possibility of rock climbing with artificial feet . In the morning when the sun rose , they made their way down to High Camp . They brewed hot lemonade on a gasoline stove , rolled up in their sleeping bags at eleven o'clock and rested for twenty-four hours . That next afternoon they saw us and we saw them . The climb was over , but we still had to get the cripples out to civilization . It was August fifth , three days later , before they both got down to Base Camp . We strapped Dave on a mule  --  he could n't walk by then ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on to the Anglo-American Clinic at Lima . Jim 's feet did n't trouble him quite so much . He rode out with the rest of us to Chiquisin on August tenth , waiting until we had dismantled all our camps and loaded the equipment on mules . We were all back in Lima by the thirteenth of August , but the doctors did n't amputate Dave 's toes for about two weeks . Dave remains undaunted . He knows that it will be many months or even years before he can balance and climb well without toes . But he said , " I 'll get a special pair of boots made , so I can climb without my toes . I 'll be back in Peru to try another mountain . " And he 'll do it , I know . So , for that matter , will the rest of us . We have another unclimbed peak in mind , perhaps a tougher one even than Yerupaja . I come from Winnetka , Illinois , which bears no resemblance to the ' mountain villages of the Alps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornell repeatedly have asked me why we want to climb such peaks as Yerupaja . The answer may be simple : To satisfy a natural human curiosity about the unknown . To pit yourself against the great forces of nature , and o win  --  that 's an achievement . It 's sport , it 's fun , and it 's something to remember with pride . The Indians , tilling their fields as we came out from Yerupaja , are less surprised about that sort of thing than most Americans . " Did you get to the top of El Carnicero ( The Butcher ) ? " they wanted to know . " And is it really the highest mountain in the world ? " THE END
