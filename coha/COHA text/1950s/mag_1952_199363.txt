The hue &; cry over Owen Lattimore , the professor and publicist who played an influential role* in the shaping of U.S. Far Eastern policy , is part of a greater clamor of alarm : What U.S. mistakes led to the Communist conquest of China and the assault in Korea ? Who is responsible for the mistakes ? <P> Last week , as Lattimore testified in his own behalf before a panel of inquiring Senators , the U.S. learned a good deal more about the professor and a little bit more about the how &; why of mistakes in the Far East . <P> Witnesses Against . The public examination of Lattimore 's record goes back to 1950 . After Wisconsin 's Senator Joe McCarthy charged that Lattimore was a " top Soviet espionage agent , " the Senate Tydings committee held hearings and gave the professor a ringing clearance . But not everyone was convinced that the last word had been said . Since last July , a Senate subcommittee on Internal Security , headed by Nevada 's Pat McCarran , had been going over the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness , ex-Communist Louis Budenz , definitely called Lattimore a Communist . <P> Another witness , former Red Army Intelligence Officer Alexander Barmine , said that his Russian superiors referred to Lattimore as one of " our men . " <P> Documents were produced from the files of the Institute of Pacific Relations to show pro-Communist influence on Pacific Affairs , I.P.R. magazine edited by Lattimore ( 1934-41 ) . <P> Presidential Aspirant Harold Stassen , Ex-Diplomat Eugene Dooman , Professors William McGovern , Kenneth Colegrove and Karl Wittfogel variously testified that Lattimore , Far East specialist and Director of the Walter Hines Page School of International Relations at Johns Hopkins , followed a line favorable to the Communists , and that his ideas had powerful backing in the State Department . <P> The Defense . To rebut this testimony , Lattimore came last week before the McCarran subcommittee with a 50-page statement that bristled with some of the angriest denunciation ever directed by a witness to a congressional inquiry . Lattimore 's statement ( released to the press before he took the stand ) categorically denied that he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on U.S. policymaking and said that actually he stood for containment of Communism , Point Four and peace . It berated the McCarran inquiry as " stacked " against him , accused it of launching " a reign of terror " against U.S. diplomats . Not since the late Harold Ickes had any polemicist turned on more derisive invective . <P> Lattimore called McCarthy the " Wisconsin whimperer ... a graduate witch-burner . " He raked Budenz as perjured and immoral , Stassen as " irresponsible , " the Nationalist Chinese as " driftwood on the beaches of Formosa . " He even flailed away at people who had not appeared before the committee ; for California 's Senator William Knowland , who believes the Nationalists should get more U.S. support , Lattimore picked up a Communist-favored sneer , " The Senator from Formosa .
