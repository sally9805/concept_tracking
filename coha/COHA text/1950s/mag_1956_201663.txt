" When I am no longer there , I do not know what will happen to Germany , " Chancellor Adenauer once said . Yet the sturdy shepherd of postwar Free Germany has long refused to designate a political heir , because to do so suggests his own withdrawal from the scene . Last week , politically beleaguered , the old ( 80 ) Chancellor gave in to the pleadings of his Christian Democratic followers and agreed to install a No. 2 man . The heir : For eign Minister Heinrich von Brentano , 52 , who will soon be made Vice Chancellor , will also remain in charge of the Foreign Ministry . <P> The move , when consummated , will put scholarly , competent Heinrich von Bren-tano in a commanding if not certain position to lead the Christian Democratic Party once Adenauer retires or dies . A tense , chain-smoking bachelor of solemn mien , Brentano is the scion of a Frankfurt family that for two centuries has produced philosophers and professors . He is a connoisseur of wines , a lover of highbrow talk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political eloquence , is an indifferent orator himself , although a good lawyerlike diplomat and bargainer . Although Brentano is one of the founders of the C.D.U . party in Hesse , he lacks the organized political following that some CDUers have , may never get to be Chancellor if the Christian Democrats fail to heal disunity in their ranks and check the growing appeal of the Social Democrats . <P> <P> In other maneuvers to check the trouble in his coalition , Chancellor Adenauer last week also decided to drop several ministers , including Defense Minister Theodor Blank , pale , plodding ex-trade-union leader who was under fire for his handling of army recruitment and equipment . Slated for the defense job is Atomic Affairs Minister Franz Josef Strauss , burly Bavarian right-winger who has coveted Blank 's job for six years , was leader of the successful fight to cut the West German conscription term from 18 to 12 months . His cur rent goal : tactical atomic weapons for West Germany .                 @ @ @ @
