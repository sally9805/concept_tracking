The Sound of Music-with Richard Rodgers supplying the music , Oscar Hammerstein the lyrics , Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse the libretto , and with Mary Martin as the star-provides " What 's in a name ? " with at least one answer : " A $2,325,000 advance sale . ' ' The show itself , in accordance with Rodgers and Hammerstein 's desire not to repeat themselves , goes to Austria at the time of the Anschluss for its story , to the famous Trapp Family Singers , who dramatically escaped from the Nazis ' clutches . Besides Captain Georg von Trapp , there were his seven children and their governess , a young novice from a neighboring abbey , who taught the children to sing , won their love , and married their father . As musicomedy , The Sound of Music combines the cloister and the kindergarten . nursery rhymes and Nazi salutes . <P> It is Composer Rodgers who meets the challenge best . With easy versatility , if no great distinction , he has written perky ditties and part songs for children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing , nice music for lovemaking , a swelling processional , a kind of hallelujah chorus . But , in general , the show 's virtues are marred by its weaknesses . For one thing , Rodgers and Hammerstein do repeat themselves : governess , children and children 's papa seem at moments the twins of The King and I. And The Sound of Music suffers badly by comparison , has less swing , less gaiety , less piquancy , less the very air of musicomedy . <P> The show 's pervasive fault is that , instead of offsetting sweetness with lightness , it turns sticky with sweetness and light . Though often attractive , the abbey scenes come off too pretty ; though sometimes fetching , the children 's scenes come off too cute . Even Mary Martin , however deft , comes off a little too lovable . The milk of human kindness is not enough for The Sound of Music . It insists on the syrup , till even the Nazis seem mere bad goblins in a fairy tale . <P> As a result , a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **34;12284;TOOLONG kind of world . In spite of a triangular love story , there is not one tantrum ; in spite of seven Trapp children , not one brat . Surely even an unexceptionable family show can be more fun : The Sound of Music ends by making its warmheartedness as cloying as a lollipop , as trying as a lisp.
