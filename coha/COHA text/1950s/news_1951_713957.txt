txt Beau Brummell 's Loss of Natty Hat Leads to His Arrest as Jewel Thief " Mr. Griffin , " one of the slickest gem thieves in New York police annals , was seized by detectives yesterday . Later they said he had admitted recent jewel thefts here . It was " Mr. Griffin " who , wan the air of a man-about-town , and the sartorial perfection to match it , robbed Schlumberger , Inc. , a fashionable jewelry store at 21 East Sixty-third Street , of gems worth *40,000 last Feb. 16 , and then repeated the offense on March 13 , getting four times the previous haul . True to type , " Mr. Griffin " encompassed his own downfall by his fastidiousness in attire . On his first call he had worn a gray homburg hat , and it was his casual manner in asking a woman employe to remove a stain from it , while he posed as a customer , that had quieted suspicions as to his intentions . Last night , detectives at the East Fifty-first Street station dieclosed that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a better make . Having twice successfully robbed Schlumberger 's , " Mr. Griffin " made the mistake of trying it again . This time a Pinkerton detective was behind the store 's locked door , refusing admittance to all who could not properly prove themselves . " Mr. Griffin " left hurriedly , and in doing so dropped the hat . It was picked up by the police , who asked the manufacturer to identify the store it had been sold through . They did and the hat store management picked out an old photograph of Arthur Chesler , 34 years old , who was listed as living at the Plaza Hotel . Like " Mr. Griffin , " Chesler was just under six feet tall , addicted to natty dressing and the possessor of a neatly trimmed mustache . The police then called upon one of Chesler 's wives  --  for he has had // three  --  and she suppied a recent photograph , which looked even more like " Mr. Griffin . " She also supplied the information that her former husband had married for the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included a reception at the Plaza Hotel . Through the information then in hand the police were able to close in rapidly . They learned that Chesler rented a green convertible Oldsmobile , for $135 a week , in which he drove about town , and that he was wont , to meet a brother , Harry Chesler Jr. , in an office at 163 West Twenty-third Street . At 5 P. M. yesterday Capt . Frank Robb , Lieut . Francis Murray , and Detectives Rudoph and James were waiting in the street at the Twenty-third Street address  --  they had been waiting off and on for quite a long time  --  when the green convertible appeared , with Chesler at the wheel . " Keep your hands on the wheel ! " Captain Robb ordered . " You 're under arrest . " With perfect calm Chesler replied , " What do you want me for ? " Pistols Found in Car The answer was for one of the detectives to slip a handcuff over Chesler 's right wrist . The precautions proved justified , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front seat  --  and another 45 , also loaded , on the back seat . Chesler at first denied everything , but after several hours of questioning agreed " to cooperate " if the police would buy him sandwiches and coffee . He then admitted , the police said , that he was , in fact , " Mr. Griffin , " and that he came of a family that owned landed property in New Jersey . He has several college degrees and has served ' both in the Navy and the Merchant Marine , he told ' the detectives . In the Feb. 16 robbery " Mr. Griffin " telephoned Schlumberger 's before going to the store . Mrs. Florence Gallo , the bookkeeper , thought she remembered his name as a customer . He entered the place , which occupies the entire parlor floor , at 4 P. M. " Oh , Mr. Griffin ? " said Mrs. Gallo . " Yes , " he said . " By the way , would you be so kind as to help me remove a stain from my hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his time ? forty-five minutes ? in studying the stock . Finally he selected a diamond engagement ring . His excellent manners made such an impression that Nicolas Bongard , a partner in the firm , " treated him like a thousand-dollar customer , " as he told the police later . " Mr. Griffin " held gems up to refract , the daylight , squinted at the facets through a magnifying glass and otherwise played the part of a bona fide customer . But when he was alone with Mr. Bongard he suddenly whipped out a pistol and announced the holdup , his manner changing completely . He scooped up his loot in unmounted diamonds , and left without hurrying . He told detectives last night that he had disposed of the loot in Mexico . On his second intrusion ? on March 13 , he came in without preliminaries , holding a revolver . This time , he worked with nervous haste but still showed some care in his selection of jewels . Apparently piqued by newspaper stories that he had missed much of value the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The police quoted Chesler as giving his occupation as " actor-artist . " They said he had been planning to rob Jay Howard , jewelers , of 62 West Forty-seventh Street , and Mrs. Harrison Williams of 1130 Fifth Avenue , of what he confidently hoped would come to a total of $1,000,000 in loot , when he was arrested . They also said he had mailed back to Schlumberger 's about $5,000 worth of stones " which he could not use . " His family 's estate , they said , is at Succasunna , N. J. The police said Mrs. Gallo and Henri Rappicad , also an employe of the store , had positively identified Chesler as the robber . Gives Data on His Life Chesler typed out a biography of himself for the police . Born in Newark , N. J. , thirty-four years ago , he was graduated from the Amundsen High School in Chicago in 1932 , he wrote . In 1936 he got his B. A. at the University of California , where he studied journalism .
