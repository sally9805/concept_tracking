When Miriam , aged 6 , first appeared at Babies Hospital in Manhattan , there was not even a name in the medical dictionaries for what ailed her . She had repeated attacks of vomiting ; reflexes like the knee-jerk were dulled or lacking ; her hands and feet were blue and cold ; she perspired so heavily that her bedclothes had to be changed soon after she fell asleep ; her blood pressure skyrocketed and plummeted inexplicably ; when she had a temper tantrum , which was often , she broke out in red blotches . But her strangest symptom sounded like something out of a fairy tale : no matter how hard she cried , there were no tears . <P> Gradually , Pediatrician Conrad Riley and a team of other specialists at Babies Hospital ( part of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center ) collected a handful of other cases showing most of Miriam 's symptoms . The one that appeared invariably was the absence or extreme scarcity of tears while crying . Another thing the doctors noted : all the children so afflicted were of Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , was reported only last week . ) <P> Painstakingly , Dr. Riley and his colleagues sought for causes and cures of what they named dysautonomia ( disorder of the automatic nervous system ) . From operations on the living and autopsies on children who died of infections , they ruled out adrenal tumors or physical damage to the brain . So far , they have found no cause , but there is no doubt that the disease runs in families , and susceptibility may be transmitted by both parents through a recessive gene . <P> So far , the doctors have not even a clue to a possible cure . A new and versatile drug , chlorpromazine , helps to control the attacks of vomiting that might otherwise last for several days each week . Beyond that , the best that the doctors can do is help the parents to establish a rigid routine in which the unhappy children can feel secure , with a minimum of occasions for emotional outbursts . Parents of dysautonomia victims have banded together to exchange notes on their children 's progress and hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for research . <P> Last week , as Dr. Riley counted a total of 35 proved cases in the New York metropolitan area ( with reports indicating a dozen more across the U.S. and Canada ) , the parents ' group met to press its claim for a state charter . After incorporation , the parents hope to raise more money to help the doctor-researchers find ways to help their mysteriously afflicted children .
