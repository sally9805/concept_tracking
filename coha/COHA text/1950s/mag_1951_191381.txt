FAMILY REUNION ( 146 pp. ) - Ogden Nash-Little , Brown ( $2.50 ) . <P> Ogden Nash , whose books have sold more than 1,000,000 copies , is probably the only writer of doggerel who has made a good thing , as well as a career , of giving calculated affront to poetry . The difference between Nash and his imitators is that somewhere in the cunningly dislocated gears of his lines he imprisons a patented point of view . It was observable in one of his earliest verses ( sold to The New Yorker , in 1930 ) , which began : <P> I sit in an office at 244 Madison Avenue And say to myself you have a responsible job , havenue ? <P> He delights in the domestic confusions and job hazards of a composite American male who is made up of equal parts Caspar Milquetoast and Mr. Blandings . <P> His touch with a bottle opener is sure , <P> But he can not help you get a tight dress over your head without catching three hooks and a button in your coiffure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can always be sure they 'll find Ogden Nash coming to their defense in rubber-legged rhyme : <P> <P> It does n't mean , my boy , that they ought to be in an asylum like Nijinsky the dancer , <P> It only means that they got into the habit of talking to themselves at home because they themselves were the only people they could talk to and get an answer . <P> <P> Nash may seem gleefully ready with complaining gibes at his white-collar victims of 20th Century living , yet in the end his motto reads : Homo Americanus , right or wrong , but my boy . <P> Family Reunion is Nash 's own scissors &; paste job , selections from his books which he himself can still read " without visibly wincing . " His hero , the distraught male , lurks everywhere , but Nash is here saluting the American family , which consists , by his definition , " not only of children , but of men , women , an occasional animal , and the common cold . " Nothing delights him more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Men and women everywhere would have a lot more chance of acquiring recreation and fame and financial independence <P> If they did n't have to spend most of their time and money tending and supporting two or three unattractive descendants . <P> <P> But few real poets have written more fondly about their own children : <P> <P> Roses red and violets blue , <P> I know a girl who is really two . <P> Yesterday she was only one ; <P> Today , I think , will be twice the fun . . . <P> Kiss me again for a lucky start , <P> And Happy Birthday , with twice my heart . <P> <P> This does n't mean that Parent Nash does n't understand the nature of his offspring : <P> <P> Innocent infants have no use for fables about rabbits or donkeys or tortoises or porpoises , <P> What they want is something with plenty of well-mutilated corpoises . <P> <P> And in a clutch , he 's quite prepared to throw his weight around : <P> <P> Well , you may be a genius , child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In spite of which , and nevertheless , <P> I could lick you yet , I guess . <P> <P> Like his own long-suffering , middle-class hero , Nash has his inexplicable ups &; downs , of the spirit as of the body . Some days he feels like a million , but life is a transient thing and no one is more sharply aware of it than Poetaster Nash : <P> <P> My little dog ten years ago
