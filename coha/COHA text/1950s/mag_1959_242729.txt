Physicians who are overconfident of germ-killing wonder drugs are living in a fool 's paradise where their patients may die . This is a favorite theme of Boston 's Dr. Maxwell Finland . Most doctors have rationalized that , although the sulfas and antibiotics let some resistant microbes slip by , they save so many lives that their occasional failures stand out more . The " increase " in such cases , they argue , is only relative , not real . Last week Dr. Finland attacked this defense . In his saddest jeremiad yet , he asserted that the antimicrobial drugs have caused an actual increase in severe infections and deaths from some hitherto harmless or uncommon germs . <P> <P> To document his conclusion , Dr. Finland told the Association of American Physicians , he and two colleagues ( Dr. Wilfred F. Jones Jr . and Research Technician Mildred W. Barnes ) spent three years poring over the records of 10,000 patients who had severe infections at the time of death in Boston City Hospital . The researchers covered 24 years , beginning with 1935 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1937 ) . Deaths caused by bacterial infections in the bloodstream dropped steadily until 1947 , they found . Since then , the rate has stayed low or dropped further for deaths caused by pneumococci and the dreaded streptococci-the organisms most vulnerable to sulfas and antibiotics . But in these twelve years there has been an absolute increase in deaths from other bacteria . <P> Among the worst offenders , said Dr. Finland , is Pseudomonas aeruginosa , or the " blue-pus organism , " which nowadays crops up more often and with greater virulence . Surprisingly , another problem microbe is Aerobacter aerogenes , found naturally on many food plants and in water and milk , as well as in man 's digestive tract . Once rated almost harmless , it is now a killer . In sum , optimists who think it is old-fashioned nonsense to talk about fatal " blood poisoning " are wrong . There are now more deaths from septicemia than there were before the antibiotic age , said Dr. Finland .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
