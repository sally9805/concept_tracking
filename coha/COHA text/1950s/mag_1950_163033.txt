" This world will at last come into a time of peace , " the Premier of Alberta said last week . " The earth will be as full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea . " <P> As he does every Sunday , Premier Ernest Charles Manning had stepped out of his role as boss of oil-booming Alberta , and assumed his other position as head of the Prophetic Bible Institute in downtown Calgary . To some 250 people , who had braved 12-below-zero weather to hear him , the pale , slender politician preached in a twangy , compelling voice . Calgary 's radio station CFCN carried his weekly Back to the Bible Hour to the rest of Alberta . <P> Pupil &; Master . Ernest Manning 's blending of religion and politics had its beginning one Sunday afternoon 23 years ago . He was a Saskatchewan farm boy when he first heard a broadcast from Calgary by William ( " Bible Bill " ) Aberhart , radio evangelist . Two years later , after listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enroll as a student at Aberhart 's Prophetic Bible Institute . <P> Night after night , big , hardy Bill Aberhart and the frail farm youth studied together , first the Scriptures , then more worldly books . When the depression was at its height they read Maurice Colbourne 's Unemployment or War , expounding the theory of Social Credit for the redistribution of wealth , as originated by England 's Major Clifford Douglas . Aberhart and Manning decided it was the answer to Alberta 's problems . <P> In 1934 the two converts naively tried to sell the Social Credit theory to the Alberta government . When they were laughed off , they resolved to form their own party , campaigned up &; down the province at political rallies that opened with prayers and hymns . Depression-hit Alberta voted the Social Crediters into office with 51 of the 57 House seats . Ernest Manning , at 27 , became Minister of Trade and Industry under Premier Aberhart . <P> Soon after they took office , the Social Crediters tried to get started on their currency reform plans , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults . In 1937 the Dominion government stepped in , ruled that a province had no right to tamper with the banking system , and the Social Credit payoff never got out of the dream stage . When Bill Aberhart died in 1943 , Social Credit 's House membership had dropped to 35 . <P> Crops &; Oil . But both Alberta and Social Credit began to undergo amazing changes soon after Manning became Premier . Record wartime crops put agriculture back on its feet . New wartime industries provided a market for Alberta coal . Premier Manning was scarcely responsible for all Alberta 's good fortune , but Albertans gave him credit for making the most of it . In the 1944 election , they returned Manning 's party to its alltime high of 51 legislative seats . Just when the war boom began to peter out , the great new oilfields at Leduc and Redwater surged in . Manning smothered the opposition with another landslide in 1948 . <P> With prosperity , the Social Credit philosophy did an about-face from starry-eyed radicalism to steady-eyed business . After ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the province 's debts , issued new bonds and began backing his word with payments .
