The Case for Mr. Parkhill I T WAS a miserable evening . All day long the rain had come down , in sudden , driving shafts , the way it used to descend upon Camp Quinnipaquig , the summer lie had spent there as a counselor . Mr. Parkhill put on his rubbers and his burberry , opened his big black umbrella , and sloshed through the streets . It was only two blocks to the little restaurant on Ninth Street , and when he got there he ordered half a grapefruit , the clam chowder , and the steamed Maine lobster . He desserted on a delectable deep-dish apple pie , and , because it was a special occasion , drank two cups of Sanka . It was his birthday . He had received a lacy birthday card from his Aunt Agatha , mailed , as it was each year , so as to arrive exactly on date , and containing , as it did each year , a crisp five-dollar bill with the tart instruction : " To be spent on something foolish . " Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other letter he had received ( and what a surprise that had been ) was from Mr. Linton , headmaster of Tilsbury : Dear Parkhill : The other night Mrs. Linton and I were reminiscing about past boys , and as we browsed through the old school annuals we came upon your photograph ( the year you were awarded the Ernestine Hopp Medal for School Spirit ) . When Mrs. Linton reminded me of the time you astonished us all , as a freshman , by parsing that sentence from Cicero during tea , we laughed merrily . The only other boy Mrs. Linton remembered so well was Wesley Collender ( ' 33 ) , who placed a copper contrivance in the fuse box at Farwell which intermittently expanded and contracted so that the " lights out " bell rang on and off , on and off , for a goodly ten minutes before Mr. Thistlewaite could ascertain the cause , and effect the remedy . Thistlewaite is no longer with us . He is , I believe , at Claremont or Carmel or some such place in the western states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , Mrs. Linton called my attention to the birth date under your picture . " Why , that is next Tuesday ! " she exclaimed , and indeed it was . 1 extend , accordingly , our felicitations , and express our joint wishes for , in lognernii urns , " many happy returns . " Faithfully yours , Amos Royce Linton It had been awfully nice of Mr. Linton to write . Mr. Parkhill could not help feeling touched . The last time he had seen " Old Molasses , " which was what the boys privately called Mr. Linton , was six years ago , when his class had presented the school with a fine , carved newel post for Modley Hall . Mr. Parkhill remembered the first time he had gone back to visit Tilsbury . It was the year after he had received his B. A. When Mr. Linton had asked him what he was doing now , Mr. Parkhill told him he had taken a substitute teaching post , just for the experience , at the American Night Preparatory School for Adults . " Parkhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " what on earth is that ? " It is a night school , sir . " " College entrances ? Cram courses ? That sort of ? " " Oh , no , sir . This is an elementary school . " " A what ? Speak up , Parkhill . " " An elementary school , sir , " Mr. Parkhill repeated , raising his voice . " For adults . " Mr. Linton must have got hard of hearing , for he had gazed at Mr. Parkhill steadily for a moment and mumbled something that sounded like " Good Godl " But that could not have been it ; that was not at all like Mr. Linton ; it was probably " Great Scott . " Mr. Parkhill often found himself thinking back to that little episode . He could understand that a man like Mr. Linton had no way of knowing what a fine institution the American Night Preparatory School for Adults really was . After all , Mr. Linton had led a rather sheltered life : Exeter , Harvard ... He wondered , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named our leading institutions of higher learning as " Yale , Princeton , Hartford . " Tilsbury . . . What a different world that had been . What a different world it was . Mr. Parkhill felt a rush of pleasant , almost poignant , memories : that lovely campus , so tidy , green , serene , composed ; the broad river that overflowed its banks in the spring ; the school pond on clear winter clays , a burnished white mirror ; the path across Main Quad , that none but lordly seniors were permitted to use .. . Those were happy days in a happy world , a world ten thousand miles and years away . Occasionally Mr. Parkhill caught himself wondering what it would have been like if he had returned to Tilsbury as a master . ( Mr. Linton had never even sounded him out on that , to be frank about it . ) Life was so curious . Who would have thought that the teacher whom Mr. Parkhill had temporarily replaced at the American Night Preparatory School for Adults would never return ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Parkhill recalled how Aunt Agatha used to ask him , whenever he visited her , if he intended to spend the rest of his life " among those people in New York . " Aunt Agatha , who had never even set foot in New York , did not understand the special rewards adults provide someone who regards teaching not as a job , but as a mission . He had once had a little fun at Aunt Agatha 's expense by saying , " Why , Aunt Agatha , just as your father brought God to the heathen , I bring Grammar to the alien . " Aunt Agatha never brought the subject up again after that . " Miss , " Mr. Parkhill called . The waitress , who had done everything well except wait , slouched toward him from the kitchen . " Check , please . " ( For some reason , Mr. Parkhill remembered the night Mr. Kaplan , chivvied by his foes , who demanded that he explain the " R.S.V.P. " he had , in a reckless burst of elegance , tacked onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vill you plizz ? ' " ) Mr. Parkhill paid his bill , put on his coat and his rubbers , stepped into the street , and opened his umbrella . The rain was , if anything , worse . He began to walk quite briskly . He could hardly wait to get to the school . Sometimes , when he entered that old , unprepossessing building , he felt as if , like Alice , he was walking through a looking-glass , into an antic and unpredictable world beyond . ISS GOLDBERG ... Mr. Scymzak . Mrs. Rodriguez ... " As Mr. Parkhill called the roll he could not help noticing that Mr. Kaplan had not yet arrived . The seat in the exact center of the front row , that seat directly in front of Mr. Parkhill 's desk , was empty . When Mr. Kaplan occupied that place , he seemed to loom out like a mountain , blotting out the rest of the class ; and when Mr. Kaplan was not in that seat , as now , it seemed a good deal emptier than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Mr. Wilkomirski .. ! It was not simply that the corporeal Mr , Kaplan was missing ; a certain point of view was missing , a magnetic pole , a spirit that expressed itself every moment the class was in session  --  with a gesture or a sigh , a whisper or grunt , a cluck , a snort , a gloat , a sneer , an approving " My ! " or an admonishing " Tskl " , a commanding 48 THE CASE FOR MR . PARKHILL " Aha ! " or a triumphant " Hau Kay ! " Mr. Kaplan 's " Hau Kay ! " often sounded like approval from on high . " Miss Mitnick . . . Miss Gidwitz . . . Mr. Kap ? " The voice of Sam Pinsky cut the fateful name in half . " Mr. Keplen asked me I should say he is onawoidably ditained . For maybe hefenarr . " Mr. Parkhill 's long years in the beginners ' grade had equipped him to translate " hefenarr. " without the slightest break in his stride , into " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put the attendance sheet to one side . " Well , class , suppose we devote the first part of the evening to  --  Recitation and Speech . " Smiles , grins , and dulcet affirmations issued from the Messrs . Plonsky and Marcus , and the Mesdames Gursky and Tomasic : they loved Recitation and Speech . Groans , moans , and piteous suspirations drifted out of Mrs. Moskowitz and Peter Studniczka : they hated Recitation and Speech . " May I remind all of you , once more , to speak slowly , carefully , enunciating as clearly as you can . Recitation and Speech can be one of our most valuable ? " " It gives me goose-dimples , " wailed Mrs. Moskowitz . " From prectice you will learn , " attested Miss Ziev , gazing at the diamond ring with which Mr. Andrassy had re-pledged his troth . " I should live so long ! " Mrs. Moskowitz fanned her many chins with a notebook . " Now , now , Mrs. Moskowitz , " said Mr. Parkhill with a smile , " nothing ventured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note from Mr. Linton , Emma dolare docei experientia leaped into his mind . How appropriate : " Experience wrought with pain teaches . " He noticed the hand of Oscar Trabish in the air . " Yes ? " " What it means ? " " I beg your pardon . " " What it means ? " Mr. Trabish repeated . ( Mr. Trabish was a cleaner-and-dyer . ) Mr. Parkhill cleared his throat . " What does ? er  --  what mean ? " " Those words you just gave . About adwentures and games ? " " Ah ! " Mr. Parkhill could not help exclaiming . " I said , ' Nothing ventured , ' not ' adventured , ' Mr. Trabish , ' nothing gained , ' not  --  er ? games . ' It is a saying . It means that if we never try , how can we hope to succeed ? " " Psssh ! " cried Mr. Pinsky , eyes closed , slapping his cheek with his palm . " Will . Mr. Keplen be mat he was n't here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not ' mat , ' " said Mr. Parkhill earnestly . " And it really would be better to say that Mr. Kaplan will be ' disappointed , ' or ' sorry , ' instead of ' mad . ' ' Mad ' means insane , or  --  er  --  crazy . " " Exactly the woid for Keplan ! " grunted Mr. Plonsky . " Wait till he comms before you insult ! " said Mr. Pinsky indignantly . Miss Caravello gave a derisive laugh . " Ifa Kaplan is scratch , Pinsky holler Ouch ! ' Ifa Kaplan is tickle , Pinsky makes ' Ha , hal ' " M. Pinsky turned to Carmen Caravello and tried to bestow upon her that glare , compounded of ice and fire , with which he had often seen Mr. Kaplan freeze the blood of his enemies . " You look like Cholly Chaplin , not Hymie Kaplen , " Mr. Blattberg snorted . " Mrs. Yanoff , " Mr. Parkhill called quickly , " will you go to the front of the room , please ? " A cantata of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Yanoff always wore black , though Mr. Yanoff was far from dead . ) She moved her chair , removed her glasses , smoothed her hair , soothed her morale , and proved her mettle by answering a question no one had asked : " So what 's to be afraid ? " " Sore ! " " Soitenly ! " " Just stend op and talk ! " the sympathetic gallery sang out . " So what 's the woist can hcppen ? " asked Cookie Kipnis . " The woist can happen is NI make four-fife mistakes , " sighed Mrs. Yanoff . This union of courage and stoicism brought a medley of praises from the pit . " Good fa you , Yanoff ! " " That 's a spirit ! " Even Miss Mitnick , the shyest of gazelles , murmured , " Bast wishes . " Mrs. Yanoff marched to the front of the room with stately tread , placed one hand on the desk for support ( it looked for a moment as if she were reeling , but she was only twisting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip , and , in a surprising baritone , a voice before which both man and beast might quail , thundered , " Mary had a little lamb , with fleas white like snow ! " M R. PARKHILL sank into a chair at the back of the room . He saw Miss Gursky poise pencil over notebook , on the alert for error ; he saw Mr. Scymzak put his hand over his eyes , the keener to attend ; he saw Mrs. Moskowitz , reprieved from recitation , slide down her noiseless ways to somnolence . Recitation and Speech had , unquestionably , begun . " This little kindergarten pome , " Mrs. Yanoff announced , " is learned by  --  by all the little kitties in America . Just like my little goil , Hinda , age tan , also learned it . So why I am taking valuable time in Racitation and Speech to mantion this simple nurse 's rhyme ? " " Why ? " tiny Mrs. Tomasic promptly chirped . " Because the would would be a batter place all arond if grownops behaved wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Congriss would be more like kindergarten , would maybe be less greft , crime and violence ! Humans : remamber children ! " And with that exhortation , her face flushed with both exertion and exaltation , Molly Yanoff marched back to her seat . She barely had time to regain it before hands were bobbing up and down like buoys in a squall . " Thank you , Mrs. Yanoff , " said Mr. Parkhill . " Now  --  er  --  discussion . " Mr. Trabish opened the post mortem by observing that Mrs. Yanoff had used " god " instead of " girl " and " woild " instead of " world . " ( Mr. Trabish had come a long way since his initiation into the beginners ' grade . ) Miss Shimmelfarb remarked that Mrs. Yanoff had " used ' tan , ' which is for color , instead of ten , ' which is for aitch ! " Stanislaus Wilkomirski deplored the fact that Mrs. Yanoff kept saying " kitties " when she obviously meant " more than one children . " Miss Caravello leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na  --  ve panacea for strife : anyone familiar with either children or kindergartens , Miss Caravello hotly observed , anyone not bemused by false sentiment , knew that our little ones would " chops off da heads " d all within reach if but possessed of the weapons and provided with the opportunity . " Cynic ! Skaptic ! Cynic ! " hissed Olga Tar-nova , thrice , then lamented , " You got no faith in moo ? In God ? In human soul ? " Miss Caravello cried " Name of the name " in Italian , and Miss Tarnova shot back an impure rejoinder in Russian , before Mr. Parkhill could impose an uneasy peace . ( Tolstoy versus Machiavelli , he thought with a certain fascination . ) " Let us limit our discussion to Mrs. Yanolf 's English , " he said earnestly . " There was one interesting mistake  --  in pronunciation  --  which has not yet been mentioned . It is most important . It occurred in Mrs. Yanoff 's very first sentence . " His students dived deep into memory to recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain . " The sentence began , " hinted Mr. Parkhill , " ' Mary had a little lamb . . " The class wandered through the caverns of " Mary had a little lamb " ? to no avail . " Did anyone notice how Mrs. Yanoff completed that quotation ? " Mr. Parkhill asked hopefully . No one seemed to have noticed how Mrs. YanolI had completed that quotation . " Well . . . " Mr. Parkhill moistened his lips . " Mrs. Yanoff said that Mary 's little lamb had fleas ' as white as snow ! " He stressed the " fleas " quite emphatically . " Maybe it was a bleck lcmb ? " ventured Fanny Gidwitz . " In New York snow is not white ! " Mr. Matsoukas , yearning for Arcady , declared , " That is not what 1 mean , " sighed Mr. Parkhill and stepped to the board , where he printed : FLEECE FLEAS But the assembled scholars did not break into the familiar responses to revelation : not a single " All " or " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary 's little Iamb , " said Mr. Parkhill earnestly , " had a ' fleece/ class , not ' fleas . ' " He went on to delineate the disasters which might follow the replacement of the sibilant with the fricative . " Why , the entire meaning of a word , or a sentence , or an idea , can be radically altered if one says ' zzz ' when one means sss , ' or sss ' when one means ' zzz . ' " " You hear ? " whispered Cookie Kipnis . " Imachin , " breathed Mr. Guttman . Mrs. Moskowitz was snoring softly . 50 THE CASE FOR MR . PARKHILL " For example ... " On the board Mr. Parkhill printed : PEAS PEACE " Ah ! " s and " Ooh ! " s and a reverent " Holy smoky ! " from Mr. Wilkomirski , who was a sexton , greeted " peas " and " peace . " Mr. Parkhill struck again , while the pedagogical iron was still hot . " Or these words . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A niece and a pair knizz is som difference ! " " Just on accont one little latter ! " " Sss ! Zzz ! " went one group of students . " Zzzl Sss ! " went another . The room buzzed as from a swarm of energetic bees . " And sometimes , class , " Mr. Parkhill plowed on , exhilarated by success , " two words are spelled alike , exactly alike , yet are pronounced differently and have entirely different meanings ! " This , alas , was too much for the beginners ' grade . " Ilanh ? " cried Mr. Marschak incredulously . " No , " groaned Rochelle Goldberg , and consoled herself with a bonbon . " Same word , same spell , no same mean ? " was the way Peter Studniczka put it . Mr. Parkhill 's chalk fairly flew across the slate as he printed : CLOSE CLOSE He turned to the class : " Now these , for instance , are two entirely different words ! " At this point Mrs. Moskowitz , returning to sentience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Mr. Parkhill 's emphatic " two entirely different words , " and released a heartrending " Oy ! die . I 'll plain die ! " ' " Close , ' " said Mr. Parkhill anxiously , " is an adjective , which means near . But ' doze , ' pronounced with the ' z , ' is a verb , which means to shut , as in ' Close the door ? ' " S I F in some perfectly timed dramatization in reverse , the door was flung open . All heads turned . There , his clothes dripping , his face wet but his smile incandescent , his glistening hair wreathed in a sort of halo from the light in the corridor beyond , stood " Mr. Keplen ! " cried Sam Pinsky . " Et lest ! " grinned Fanny Gidwitz . Not all his comrades greeted Hyman Kaplan in such joyous accents . " About time ! " scowled Mr. Plonsky , squinting at his watch to see what time it actually was . " You had to stop maybe on the way at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You arriving or leaving ? " inquired Miss Gursky . Mr. Trabish announced , " Mr. Kaplan is n't Late ; the class is early ! " Mr. Kaplan suffered these petty taunts nobly . " I could n't find fest vat I vanted , " he said mysteriously . " An ' texis are scerce like a chicken 's toot . " " Good evening , Mr. Kaplan , " said Mr. Parkhill dryly . It was just like Mr. Kaplan to enter a room that way . Any other student arriving this late would have courted invisibility , opening the door like a mouse , entering on tiptoes like a thief , creeping to the nearest vacant seat , speaking only if spoken to  --  and then only to mumble some agonized incomprehensibility . Not Hyman Kaplan . He could not even arrive late without endowing it with the attributes of a world pre-mitre . He made his tardiness an occasion that somehow called for public rejoicing . Mr. Parkhill noticed that Mr. Pinsky was signaling to Mr. Kaplan with surreptitious flip-pings of his hand , accompanied by clandestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaplan merely nodded with a certain insouciance and made not the slightest move to enter the room . " Do come in , " said Mr. Parkhill , not without a tinge of sarcasm . " Axcuse me , " said Mr. Kaplan ; but his expression was not at ail like " excuse me . " ' ' You blockink de dask . " Mr. Parkhill could hardly have been more astonished . He had indeed moved , without think-ing of it , from the blackboard to the side of the desk nearest the door ; but why that should impede Mr. Kaplan 's passage from the door to his seat , a path entirely unobstructed by Mr. Parkhill or the desk , Mr. Parkhill could not for the life of him comprehend . " Mr. Kaplan , " he began frostily , " I believe ? " He never finished the sentence . For the moment he turned , Mr. Kaplan lunged toward the desk , whipped a large object from behind his back , placed it on the desk with a flourish , and cried , " Soprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( now that Mr. Parkhill thought of it ) , erupted into salutations and applause . " Congrejulation ! " " Happy boitday ! " " A hondritt more ! " Even Mrs. Moskowitz , returned from hibernation , sang out : " De present is from all ! " Mr. Parkhill felt his neck getting warm ; a flush crawled up his cheeks . So that was why Mr. Kaplan was so late ... and why he had made so odd an entrance .. and why he had seemed so unapologetic . Ile had been shopping ... But how in the world had they found out ? Mr. Kaplan was pointing to the parcel on the desk . " So open op . " " Let all have look , " called Mrs. Rodriguez . " Could be teacher already has it , " Dostoevsky 's daughter intoned in her customary premonition of doom . " Impossible ! " Mr. Kaplan glowered . Mr. Parkhill realized that they were awaiting his every word . " 1 ? er  --  well , class ? " He cleared his throat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what to say ? " echoed Miss Ziev in delight . " Do n't say . Enjoy ! " called Stanislaus Wilkomirski . Mr. Kaplan raised his hand imperially . " Procidd , Mr. Pockheel . " Mr. Parkhill fumbled with the wrapping on the parcel . It was gold-colored , with a bow of white ribbon the size of a cantaloupe , and wet , which made it singularly difficult to remove . " Reep it ! " " Pull , maybe . " " Cot ! " " From de site ! " He removed the cantaloupe and the ribbon , and before the gold-colored paper came off the parcel , Mr. Parkhill suspected what was contained within . An attach ? case . He pulled the last , damp strip of paper away . It was . An attach ? case . " Pssh ! " cried Mr. Pinsky , slapping his cheek in ecstasy . " Is dat beautiful ! " " Use in bast of halth , " called Miss Goldberg , reaching for a nougat . " Bella ! Bella ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaplan passed his lighthouse beam across the ranks before him and inquired , sotto Imre , " How 's abot mine choice ? " " Fine ! " " I got ta admit ! " " Poifict ! " Mr. Kaplan accepted their accolade and signaled for silence again . All eyes converged on Mr. Parkhill . He wiped his palms . " Well , class , this is really very kind ? " " Mr. Pockheel , " Mr. Kaplan cut in with the pained air of a Brahmin forestalling some ghastly breach of protocol , " de acknowledgink comms efter de prezantink ! " " Oh , " said Mr. Parkhill . " Excuse me . " M R. KAPLAN faced his confreres , raised his arms to shoot his cuffs rather more ceremoniously than usual , inclined his head in the gracious manner of the Queen Mother distributing prizes at some rustic bazaar , and orated : " Distingvished titcher of beginnis ' grate of Amarican Night Prap School for Adolts , prod mamhers of de cless . . . " ( Mr. Parkhill wondered why it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . ) " Tonight ye have a fine , a foist-cless occasion . Soch occasion is corn-mink only vunce a year to eny man , an ' netchelly also only vunce a year iven to our lovely titcher ! " Mr. Kaplan paused for the applause he deemed appropriate at this juncture ; it came ; it departed at a wiggle of Mr. Kaplan 's forefinger . " Ve all like boitdays  --  especially odder pipple 's ! " Mr. Kaplan bestowed a glance of rebuke upon Mrs. Rodriguez , with whom he had once locked horns over that vanity which impels women to tamper with chronology . " So tonight ve vill tsalebrate Mr. Pockheel 's , in a briff ceremonia . Ve got no program , ufcawss . Still an ' all ? " " Make short , in Gott 's name ! " Mr. Plonsky broke in , then turned to face the rear wall in a gesture of supreme disgust . " The Declaration Constitution did n't take so long , " exclaimed some secret member of the Plonsky-Blattherg cabal. 52 THE CASE FOR MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Miss Mitnickl " " Rose Mitnick ! " " Speech from Miss Mitnick ! " came a dozen rebel cries . Olga Tarnova waved her perfumed handkerchief . " You 'll gat Mitnick. " said Mr. Kaplan with an expression that signified there is no accounting for human folly . " So now , fallow-students of heginnis ' grate , to prezant de prazent , givink rizzons an ' full description , ye vill hear Fromm de odder mamber of de Boitday-Prazent-for-Mr. - Pock heel Committee ! " The loyal friends of Rose Mitnick cleaved the air with their plaudits and turned toward their Guinevere . ( Mr. Plonsky half-turned . ) But Miss Mitnick , skittish as a fawn under ordinary circumstances , now see : ned totally indistinguishable from her background . She had slumped deep in her chair , her skin the color of oatmeal , her eyes stricken with panic . " Mitnick , " called Mr. Kaplan . The wan maiden made a strangling sound ; her lips were open but her tongue was paralyzed . " Milnick ! " called Mr. Kaplan urgently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got stage-fried ! " cried Fanny Gidwitz . " Svallowed her tong ! " mourned Miss Kipnis . " Miss Mitnick , Miss Mitnick , stand op , Miss Mitnick ! " moaned Mrs. Moskowitz . It had the cadence of a dirge . " Somebody slcp her hends ! " suggested Cookie Kipnis . " Make ' Boor " " Snep fingers ! " " Could be her shoes are too tight , " ventured Mr. Blattberg , who sold footwear . " She nidds at lease a 5-B . " The hollow tones of Olga Tarnova rose above the others . " Wonce I saw octress , had scemilar choke-in-troat . Eight minutes . In Rossia . In weenter . By lohver 's funeral . Was sod , sod . " ( Sometimes Mr. Parkhill thought Miss Tarnova could not so much as say " Good morning " without invoking some image of tragedy on the frozen steppes . ) Mr. Kaplan was staring at Miss Mitnick with as much horror as she was gaping at him with terror . " Mitnick , " he called , pleading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Pockheel ! " No other tocsin could have penetrated Miss Mitnick 's benumbment . She rose , an automaton ? ashen , trembling , clutching her handkerchief ? fixed her eyes in a jellied glaze on a point in the middle of Mr. Parkhill 's chest , and with muffled voice plunged into the fire : " On behalf of beginners ' grade and all students in it , I prcsant this little key ? " Miss Mitnick stopped . " ? this key ? " she gibbered , blinking her eyelids . " Key . . . hey . . . " Mr. Kaplan snapped his fingers , reached into his pocket , and pulled out a red ribbon from which two tiny keys dangled . " Two keys , " he whispered . " Make plural . " Miss Mitnick took the ribbon , held it out stiffly and completed her ordeal : " I presant these keys to now open the guaranteed genuine leather , full-lined , solid-brass-hinges  --  the case for Mr. Parkhill ! " Now it was done . Applause . Delight . Felicitations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He coughed . " Thank you . 1 ? er  --  am most grateful . It 's very kind of you , of all of you . Thank you ever so much . " As he fitted one of the little keys into the lock , he noticed for the first time that the case was initialed . The initials were " M. P. " M. P. ? How strange . " M. P. " stood for " mounted police , " or " Member of Parliament . " But his initials were not M. P. His first name did not even begin with " M. " He heard the rain splattering on the window , and the distant city noises with their ubiquitous intimation of the raffish . At Tilsbury , the peepers would herald each spring in night-whistlings so constant and so melodious that none who first heard them could believe his ears . For some reason Mr. Parkhill suddenly recalled the odd expression on Mr. Linton 's face that time he had first told him about the American Night Preparatory School for Adults . Then Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up . The faces that loomed before him were rather larger than life , it seemed : Mr. Kaplan , Miss Mitnick , Miss Tarnova . Pinsky , Plonsky , Caravello . They seemed unified , for once , in most unfamiliar concord . And it was clear to him , of a sudden , why the initials on the case were " M. P. " Obviously . They always called him " Mr. Parkhill. - What reason was there , indeed , to use his first name ? Why , he could hardly remember the last time anyone had addressed him by it .
