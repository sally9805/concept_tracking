In his 81st year , William Heard Kilpatrick is still a formidable figure to U.S. educators-a courtly , silver-haired scholar who next to John Dewey has been the nation 's foremost apostle of progressive education . Some schoolmen have revered him and some have damned him , but all have felt his influence . Last week scholars and educators from all over the U.S. assembled in a Manhattan ballroom to celebrate his fourscore years . And last week , in a new biography by ex-Student Samuel Tenenbaum , *readers could learn just what his influence has been in the U.S. school system . <P> Fame &; Flurries . The son of a Baptist minister , William Kilpatrick first began to be known after he joined the staff of Columbia University Teachers College back in 1907 . But even before that time , he had already proved that he was a rebel at heart . As a grammar-school principal in Georgia , he had stirred up flurries of controversy by doing away with report cards and never punishing his pupils . Later , as a professor of mathematics at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy by admitting that he did not believe in the Virgin birth . After a three-day theological trial before the trustees , he was forced to resign . Some months after that , he headed north to Columbia . <P> At Teachers College , Rebel Kilpatrick found a permanent home at last . " Everything seems to center here , " he once wrote , and to a large extent he was right . Under the leadership of such men as Philosopher John Dewey and Psychologist <P> Edward Thorndike , the era of the modern pedagogue had begun . The traditional classroom was being attacked from all sides . Like Dewey , Kilpatrick held that there are no philosophical absolutes , that " criticized experience is the final test of all things . " That being the case , education had to be designed anew . <P> Action to Action . The important thing about learning , Experimentalist Kilpatrick insisted , was not the subject but the child . He saw no point in mere textbook education which , fed to passive students , " reduced man to mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , said he ; and therefore education must be based on action , every action leading to better action : " Thinking , unless it works , is n't worth anything . . . " <P> Over the years , educators began to listen closely to the live &; learn philosophy . And so many students ' fees poured into Teachers College because of Kilpatrick that he came to be known as the " Million Dollar Professor . " In school after school , teachers began to turn away from traditional subject matter , adopting in its stead the Kilpatrick " project method . " His books were translated into seven languages ; " activity programs " began cropping up in classrooms all over the world , stressing creation over memory , interest over coercion , how to think over what to think . <P> But in spite of such widespread acceptance of his theories , William Kilpatrick soon found the pendulum swinging the other way . At 80 he remains an incorrigible rebel , but in revolt against a counterrevolution , started by men like the late William C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Hutchins . His critics in education have long sought to repeal him , insisting that in trying to breathe life into the schools , he has merely blown away their substance .
