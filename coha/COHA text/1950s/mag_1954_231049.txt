Agricultural Castelfranco ( pop . 20,000 ) is one of the Reddest districts in the Reddest province ( Modena ) of all Italy . It unfailingly elects Communists to the major offices and contributes to the region 's big Red plurality in national elections . But in Castelfranco recently , some 66 of the community 's 1,500 registered party members turned in their party cards . Last week one of the defectors explained why . <P> " To be a Communist has become too much of a luxury , " said ex-Comrade Angelo Bardi . " It is n't only the party dues 200 lire a month , it 's all the contributing that comes afterwards . Every day someone from the party comes begging for contributions-for L'Unita , for the funeral of persecuted citizens of some country I do n't know , for help for jailed comrades , for comrades who have just got out of jail , or for a gift for Comrade Secchia Italy 's No. 3 Communist . They solicit contributions for Indo-Chinese comrades , for Chinese guerrillas , for bigger cooperatives , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell'meetings , for striking French miners and all kinds of other causes . Last year I paid out 25,000 lire $40 in contributions . How can I possibly give so much when my annual income is only 170,000 lire $272 ? I just can not permit myself such luxuries as belonging to the Communist Party . I have a wife and two children , and for six months of the year I can not find work . " <P> The party tried to talk Angelo out of his decision . " All kinds of people came to see me . They talked big words like ideological deviationism . They even tried to scare me . But I told them I did n't know anything about ideology and that I joined the party only because they said they would help poor people like me . When I saw that was n't so , I quit . "
