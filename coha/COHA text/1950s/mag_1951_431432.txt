 | THE MAN WHO LICKED CANCER By A. E. Hotchner The NAVY perhaps means more to Lt. Commander Edwin Miller Rosenberg than to any other seafaring man now in service . He talked about it in a tone of unconcealed devotion when I visited him aboard the destroyer Vogelgesang , of which he is skipper . As I listened to his incredible and inspiring story I studied him : handsome head , trim body , resolute eyes . No one would suspect that here was a man who at 32 had fought off four attacks of cancer . A man who was told five years ago that he had but two weeks to live . Miracle ? Not in Rosenberg 's estimation . Even as a small boy in Idaho , Rosenberg wanted to go to Annapolis and become an officer in the Navy . All through school in Rock Island , Ill .. , he prepared himself for the Academy . He had no pull , but he stalked every important person in town . I lc sat in outer offices , wrote letters , managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his zealous campaigning the town became convinced that it would be unpatriotic not to send young Rosenberg to Annapolis . His Congressman recommended him for appointment . Rosenberg was graduated from the Academy a few days after Pearl Harbor , and assigned to the USS Omaha as the most junior of ensigns . In three years of combat he learned his job well ; everything about the ship fascinated him . " All I 've ever wanted out of life , " he says , " is to be a good naval officer , and I knew that that meant learning everything  | about the Navy , including air . " Lieutenant Rosenberg left the Omaha and went to Dallas to start ( light training . His wife , whom he had married in t9.42 , went with him . Rosenberg was in his final course at nsacola when one Sunday morning he was stricken with a violent o mach-ache . He ran a fever of 104 grces , his right side was red and ollen , and he was in acute pain . lie tentative verdict at the naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten days the fever subsided , the swelling disappeared and he went back to flight training . In January 1945 he got his Navy wings . However , while running an obstacle course , he hit his groin and the ensuing attack was even more serious than the first one . High fever , backache , nausea ? DOW he knew he was a sick man , but he was determined not to be put out of action . He was aboard the aircraft carrier Rudyerd Bay when the war ended . In constant and severe pain , he ould not stand straight and was losing weight and energy . The ship 's doctor was worried , but Rosenberg was bent on staying with his ship until it was decommissioned . The Rudyerd Bay was moth-balled in 1946 , and Rosenberg entered Chelsea Naval Hospital in Boston . Two days later surgeons removed a tumor from his right side . Then they told him the grim truth . The groin tumor was malignant , and they had found another tumor inside a kidney . They were going to perform a cystoscopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' pain ' to me , " Rosenberg says , " and immediately t think of that cystoscope . They certainly separate the men from the boys with that one . " After the cystoscopy , a naval doctor came into Rosenberg 's room . " What I am going to tell you is not easy , " he said . " But I think you 'd prefer it right from the shoulder . That kidney tumor is cancerous . I 'd say you have about two weeks to live . In cases like yours , radiation is used . We 're going to send you to Brooklyn Naval Hospital where they specialize in cancer . " Later the doctor came back to ask Rosenberg if he would like legal help in drawing up a will . That afternoon Rosenberg way ; wheeled into a medical class as an exhibit of " cancer that will in all probability be fatal . " The lecturer said , " Young men like this ca n't have much more than a two- , threeweek life expectancy . " " By the time I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosenberg says . " I sent for the doctor . Listen , ' I said . All day people have been saying , " Poor Rosenberg , no hope for him . " The way I see it , hope is a thing for me to determine , not medicine . You just do your best for me and let me do the hoping . You say radiation is the one chance  - -  - well , let 's get down to that X-ray machine , so I can get back to active duty . What the hell 's this fear that gets everybody the minute they ' hear the word cancer ? ' " " I know how you feel , " the doc-  | tor had replied , " and you 're right about not wasting time ? we 'll give you an X-ray treatment before you leave tonight for Brooklyn Naval . But you better be set straight about one thing ? even if you should overcome the cancer , you 'll never be able to stay in the Navy . No cancer patient ever has . " " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosenberg had said . When the doctor left the room , Rosenberg bowed his head and prayed , silently and intensely . For in prayer Rosenberg , a devout Lutheran , has always found strength . " No man should try to assess another 's hope , " he says , " until he has heard his prayers . " In the weeks that followed , at Brooklyn , Rosenberg underwent constant radiation . Each day , dye was pumped into the kidney so that the cancer could be studied . After each treatment he was violently sick . Yet not once did he discuss his illness in anything but positive terms with his wire , who was constantly at his side . Nor was any lawyer consulted to put his affairs in order . In three months the " miracle " was achieved . The doctors marveled at the X-ray plates which showed That the malignant tumor had disappeared . Rosenberg felt fine . He asked to be returned to active duty . But the policy of the hospital 's survey board was to put cancer patients on the permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Give me a chance to pick up my life where I left off . " The board compromised : take a 30 day leave , and then they would study the results of a thorough physical examination . At the end of the leave he reported to the hospital , confident of his fitness . But the Navy 's medicos found a new cancer  --  in his neck . When he was back in the hospital for X ray treatment , Rosenberg 's candle of hope with-its wick of prayer burned just as brightly . The cancerous tumor was contained , then gradually diminished , finally was obliterated . This time , however , the survey board was firm . So , in September T946 , Rosenberg appealed to the retirement board in Washington . " I 'm too good a naval officer to be retired , " he pleaded . " If I live only a year , at least the Navy will have gotten that year 's service out of me ? otherwise they 'll be paying me retirement money and getting nothing for it . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possibility .  | Tie statistical chart gave Rosenberg . in estimated life expectancy of six months . " Enjoy your last days with your family . " " What am I , a statistic or a human being ? " Rosenberg demanded . The board was sympathetic . He should take up the matter with the final authority , the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery . For the next six weeks Rosenberg practically lived in the M &S; offices . He finally got an interview with a captain who advised him to go to Florida and lie on the sand . " I ca n't sit around and wait to die , " he said . His perseverance paid off . He was sent to Bethesda Hospital for a checkup ? if he passed he would be returned to sea duty . Rosenberg prayed as never before in his life . At Bethesda he endured another cystoscopy , submitted to a long series of tests . The tests disclosed that ? for the fourth time ? he had cancer , in the same region as the first one . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time he was again declared okay . But he knew the retirement that had been slapped on him was final . It had been a heartbreaking fight . He had lost . He rented a house in Annapolis and got a job teaching in a private school . Within a year he had wangled an assignment teaching seamanship and navigation at the Naval Academy . Each year , on the anniversary of his retirement , he wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Navy , telling him what good shape he was in and asking to be recalled to active duty . But the only way this could happen was to have a special law passed . For weeks Rosenberg haunted the Senate Chamber . One day during a recess he met Senator Hickenlooper . When the Iowa Senator heard his story , he promised to introduce the necessary bill . On July io , 1950 , the unprecedented legislation came up before the Senate Committee on Armed Services . Rosenberg was asked if he wanted to make a statement . He talked from his heart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost overcome with emotion , " the Navy is my heart and soul . There is nothing else in life that I care to do . I do not think it is right for the country to support a healthy man for doing nothing , and I think that by putting me back on the active list it can obtain a competent naval officer . " I am confident that with the Lord 's help I have about 3o more years of service that I am willing to contribute . " The bill was eventually passed by the Senate . Painstakingly , Rosenberg repeated the same process of determined persuasion to get the bill passed by the House . The President signed it on August 22 , 1950 . After completing refresher courses , Rosenberg was assigned to active duty aboard a destroyer . When I interviewed him , his ship had returned to Norfolk after months in the Mediterranean . " I am a well and happy man , " he  | told me . " I have a nice home here in Norfolk , a lovely wife and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best ships afloat . " When the newspapers carried the story of my recovery , I received mountains of letters from people all over the world . They begged me to give them the cancer cure I had used . I wrote every one of them : believe in yourself , and in the Lord ; that is the cure , if you want to call it that . The man who gives up hoping is a victim ; the man who hopes can conquer . When I was at Brooklyn Naval Hospital I talked to hundreds who came into the wards ready to die , scared by a word ? cancer . " I asked them if they knew how to pray , and if they did n't I prayed with them and helped them to learn . Pretty soon they had built up their morale , and cancer was just a disease . Some of those men did die , but many of them lived , perhaps be cause they had grown stronger than their fear . There was that morning at Chelsea when the doctor suggested I send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sent for a lawyer , I 'm sure that I would be dead today . "
