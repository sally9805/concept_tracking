In exile in Illinois , Formosa 's ex-Gov governor Dr. K. C. Wu has grown increasingly violent in denouncing the Chiang Kai-shek regime he once served . " Formosa has been perverted into a police state , " he cried shrilly in Look . Last week China 's most respected scholar , Dr. Hu Shih , onetime ( 1938-42 ) Ambassador to the U.S .. entered an emphatic rebuttal . It was all the more forceful because Philosopher Hu <P> Shih , a stout anti-Communist and longtime supporter of Chiang Kaishek , has himself long been an open critic of the Kuomintang . <P> Writing in this week 's New Leader , Hu Shih was particularly scornful of K. C. W7u 's implication that the political and military situation was good while he was governor of Formosa ( 1949-53 ) , but that it has deteriorated tragically since . <P> " The fact is , " said Hu Shih , " that Formosa was far from the rule of law and democracy in those early years of 1949-51 ... and only in the last three years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater measure of civil liberties and the rule of law than at any time in the past . . . Freedom of speech and the press is now shared by all who have the moral courage to speak out . . . Elections have been and still are quite free . In the recent May 2 elections , the Kuomintang candidate for mayor in the capital city of Taipei . . . was overwhelmingly defeated . " <P> In discussing freedom of the press , Hu Shih knew whereof he spoke : he had lent his name to the critical fortnightly , Free China , which Wu conceded to be an exception to his accusation . Hu Shih 's retort : Whoever heard of a police state that permitted " exceptional " freedom ? <P> Then Philosopher Hu Shih turned to K. C. Wu 's own conduct in exile . For a scholar who measures his words , his judgment was scathing : " The battle for freedom and democracy has never been fought and won by craven , selfish politicians who remain silent while they enjoy political power , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , smear their own country and government , for whose every mistake or misdeed they themselves can not escape a just measure of moral responsibility .
