txt ? Iraq 's Premier visited Damascus today to confer with Syrian leaders and King Saud of Saudi Arabia . In effect this was a public gesture of reconciliation between Baghdad and Damascus . Tonight Ali Jawdat of Iraq , President Shukri al-Kuwatly of Syria and King.Saud sat down to a gala Arab feast in the main hall of the Syrian Parliament building , with the flags of all the Arab countries hanging overhead . At the head table with them were Sabri el-Assali , Syria 's Premier , and Nazim Kudsi , Speaker of Parliament . Mr. Jawdat ended his talks in Damascus and left for Beirut , Lebanon , after telling reporters that Syria and Iraq " have now arrived at a complete understanding , " The Associated Press reported . Last Iraq Visit in 1955 The last visit of an Iraqi Premier to Damascus was early in 1955 , just after Iraq and Turkey had signed the mutual defense treaty that became the basis of the Baghdad Pact organization .

Syria refused and since then has joined with Egypt in violent opposition to that defense alignment as an " imperialist instrument . " Diplomats here were puzzled to know just what could have persuaded Syria and Iraq to make the gesture of reconciliation today .

Soviet Aid Some persons suggest that it is evidence of Arab willingness to accept Syria 's tie with the Soviet Union and give it their blessing . Moscow recently undertook to supply the Syrians with arms and economic aid . To others there is more logic in the idea that King Saud , who arrived here yesterday , believes a tightening of the bonds among the Arabs is the way to avoid losing Syria from the family . King Saud began playing a prominent role in Arab policy when he visited the United States at the beginning of this year .

King Saud came back from this trip with reassuring statements about his confidence in ' President Eisenhower and the people of the United States . His influence became so strong at the moment of crisis between ' Jordan and Syria last April when King Hussein dismissed a number of leftist officials in Jordan , that it caused a bitter reaction in Syria . Remarks made by Syrian officials were so critical that King Saud withdrew his ambassador for some weeks . and nearly broke off relations with Syria . That was patched up with explanations . but without the ' degree of satisfaction originally asked by the Saudis . By his current visit , however , King Saud is informing the world that unity among the Arabs is his foremost aim .

For nearly three years the two countries have been living in a state of strained relations and periodically accusing each other of hostile plotting . Syria , it is believed , may have a little of the same feeling because of the uproar that has been aroused by her new agreement with the Soviet Union . From a general Arab viewpoint , this public demonstration of cordiality . among three of the leading Arab states strengthens their position in world affairs .
