The French worker-priest movement , one of the century 's most exciting and most debated religious experiments , finally died last week after long illness . <P> To win back France 's Communist-led , largely unchurched working classes , the French cardinals in 1943 founded the " Mission to Paris . " Specially trained young priests began to take jobs in factories to pursue their evangelizing mission more effectively ; wearing overalls , they held fulltime jobs , said Mass and performed other pastoral duties during off hours . By 1953 , it was obvious that something had gone wrong : of almost 150 worker-priests , some 20 had married and left the church while others had joined Communist unions or Redline causes . Pope Pius XII sternly limited les prtres-ouvriers to three hours of factory life a day , but only a handful submitted ; others left the church , and only 25 continued in their mission , eventually won limited approval from their bishops . <P> De-Christianized ? Last spring Maurice Cardinal Feltin , Archbishop of Paris , asked permission from the Vatican 's Holy Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome came a firm no . Last week , as French cardinals and bishops met in Paris to discuss the situation , the Holy Office 's confidential directive was published in Le Monde ( after an obvious leak , perhaps from a disgruntled French prelate ) . <P> Speaking for the Holy Office , Giuseppe Cardinal Pizzardo agreed that the church must try to recapture the French workers ' allegiance ( although he noted stiffly that men who received the " sacred and indelible mark of baptism " could not be considered totally " de-Christianized " ) . But , continued Pizzardo , " it is above all through words that the priest must testify , and not by manual labor accomplished among workers as if he were one of them . . . Work in factories or shops is incompatible with a priest 's life and aims . " Even if a worker-priest could find time to say Mass and perform his other duties , he would still spend time " on manual labor that should be devoted to sacred studies ; he is also plunged into a materialistic environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chastity . He is made to think like his fellow workers in union and social matters and becomes enmeshed in the class struggle . " <P> Upside Down ? In place of the worker-priests , the Holy Office recommended the formation of secular institutes composed of priests and laymen . Under the instruction and guidance of the priests , said the letter , the lay apostles could carry on the mission in the factories . <P> There were signs that the French hierarchy , traditionally jealous of its independence from Rome , was disgruntled by the sharpness of the Vatican 's order . " Rome could tell us to stand on our heads and of course we would , " said one church official in Paris , " but even upside down we would hold fast to our own view on what is at stake here .
