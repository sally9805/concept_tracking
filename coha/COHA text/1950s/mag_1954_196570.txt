Telephones jangled all over Washington within a few hours after the Post last week headlined on Page One : A-SUBMARINES HELD UNFIT FOR BATTLE NOW . <P> Among those trying to find out about the story were Defense Secretary Charles Wilson , AECommissioner Lewis Strauss - and President Dwight Eisenhower . Cause of the excitement was a deliberate " leak " from the office of Rear Admiral Lewis S. <P> Parks , the Navy 's chief of information and distinguished submariner in World War II , who should have known better . <P> A Parks aide and fellow submariner , Commander Slade Cutter , onetime Annapolis football hero ( he kicked the field goal that beat Army 3-0 in the 1934 game ) , was the direct source of the leak ( " Hell " said an old Pentagon hand , " that was no leak , it was a fire hose " ) . The inside dope from the Parks office , as splashed out in the Pentagon pressroom : the atomic submarine Nautilus is really unsuited for combat ; it is too big , too expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an afterthought ; its sonar equipment will not work at high speed ; it has no safety features . All the criticisms were either false or distorted , and some of them were ridiculous as well . <P> A Brassbound Attempt . Veteran Pentagon newsmen recognized the story for what it was : a brassbound attempt to strike at Rear Admiral Hyman G. Rickover ( TIME , Jan. 11 ) and his Nautilus . But a relatively inexperienced United Press reporter used the story . He quoted " a Navy spokesman , " viz. , Cutter , as saying : " The Nautilus is strictly a test vehicle . I doubt if she will ever fire a shot in anger . " <P> When the story appeared in print , Strauss , Wilson and the White House raged . The White House called Strauss : Why , it wanted to know , is a Navy spokesman making destructive remarks about the boat which the top defense minds , including the Navy 's best submariners , to say nothing of the President himself , have unqualifiedly approved . <P> The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its christening next week aggravated the offense . Secretary Wilson , as the man in whose bailiwick the trouble had started , was madder than anyone . <P> A Radish-Red Admiral . Wilson called in a whole task force of top Pentagon personnel for a blistering , table-thumping session which started with midday lunch and ended after 6 p.m . Frequently during the afternoon . Wilson tapped with thumb and forefinger on a memorandum written by Parks and Cutter which , like the U.P . story , described the Nautilus as a " test vehicle . " But a radish-red Admiral Parks stoutly denied that he had leaked the story . <P> The next day , Slade Cutter got Navy orders to go full speed astern . He had to endure the humiliation of going into the Pentagon pressroom and " leaking " the news that the Nautilus was indeed combat-worthy . When newsmen sniggered at his straight-faced efforts , Cutter said : " Well , that 's the party line , anyway . " <P> All in all , on the eve of the atomic revolution in seapower , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
