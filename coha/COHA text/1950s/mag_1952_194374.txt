The first effects of the new Kremlin twist-back to Popular Fronts-was felt in Greece last week . There , with a national election only a week off , the Communists were switching to middle-of-the-road political parties . The orders came via " bandit radio " from Rumania , with the voice of exiled Communist leader Nicholas Zachariades telling Greeks to vote for Premier Nicholas Plastiras ' National Progressive Union of the Center in the Nov. 16 general election . While naming Plastiras " a traitor ... an enemy of the people and an agent of American-ocracy , " Zachariades said Communist voters must aim at " getting the highest possible democratic concentration , " particularly on local slates . The reason : " The Communists personally despise the executioner , Papagos , much more . " <P> Collapsing Coalition . Despise was hardly the word . The Communists mortally hate and fear aging ( 68 ) Field Marshal Alexander Papagos , who in 1949 , with U.S. help , defeated the Communists on the battlefield . Greece 's No. 1 military hero ( commander in chief of Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Greece 's No. 1 political leader but for a personal quarrel with King Paul . His Greek Rally Party polled the largest number of seats in the last election , but the King snubbed the Field Marshal and handed the government to a coalition of Plastiras Progressives and Venizelos Liberals . The coalition fell to pieces when it became apparent that it could govern only with the tacit support of the crypto-Communist Democratic Union Party . <P> <P> Last week John Passalides , head of the party-line Democratic Union , called on Premier Plastiras , who has recently suffered two strokes . Said he : " Without entering at this moment into any criticism of what you have done or failed to do . . . I hereby propose . . . for the sake of democracy and the nation , that we cooperate in the coming elections . " If Plastiras was embarrassed , he did not show it . He did not formally agree to accept Communist support , but his election propaganda took a sharp , easily recognizable turn : it charged the opposition Greek Rally Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal Papagos ( who fought and beat Mussolini 's armies in 1940 and was imprisoned by the Nazis for two years ) was angry , but not so furious as the newspapers supporting him . Said Athens ' Apogevmatini : " If the United Center should gain power through Communist support , Papagos will not permit you to climb to power . " At week 's end Papagos had to tone down his supporters ' exuberance : He would stand by the election results whatever they were , he said . Actually the Communist switch , aimed so nakedly at taking over the machinery of the middle-of-the-road parties , may do the Papagos forces more good than harm .
