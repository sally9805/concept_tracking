Macbeth did not strikingly differ as a production from the Old Vic 's competent , rather than brilliant , Richard II and Romeo and Juliet . But it so much more powerfully reverberated as a play as to offer greater rewards . And much of its strength lay in what had been the earlier productions ' weakness-the title roles : despite limitations , Macbeth and his lady made a striking pair . <P> Any competent Macbeth may be expected to convey the rushing theater , the rising drama of the first three acts and the intense poetry of almost all the play . The Old Vic did both things and something more . It communicated what is so ominous , so Oedipus-like , in the prophecies that by seeming to shield Macbeth from Nemesis only speed him toward it . And it caught the play 's feudal , barbaric , night-lighted atmosphere , the sense of a haunted world no less than a haunted man . <P> At such harder tasks as countering the terrific fourth-act drop in pressure , or achieving truly tragic stature for Macbeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic enough figure of evil , and at moments a man of intense , Hamlet-like imagination . But the difference between the two men that Saintsbury noted-that Macbeth can never leave off whereas Hamlet can never begin , so that Macbeth is increasingly ruthless and consistently unremorseful-is what makes Macbeth not easily tragic . Rogers could not convey what might make him so : an awful sense of alienation , of that <P> Honor , love , obedience , troops of friends I must not look to have ; <P> of the hideous price , even should he succeed . <P> Coral Browne 's Lady Macbeth also lacked depth , and failed in the sleepwalking scene . Yet , if theatrical , she was often commandingly so . And the two together went far beyond mere partnership in crime . Theirs was a fierce connubial bond that helped humanize a woman who all but lacks humanity and a man who all but loses it . <P> <P> Major Barbara , on any basis of talent , is certainly major Shaw . Seldom was G.B.S. so fertile and brilliant-though he seldom so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on this mask and that , turned to this side or the other , came closest to a complete about-face . Here , in exalting a great munitions-maker , Socialist Shaw fired , as never so fiercely again , on his own ranks . The real weakness of Major Barbara is not that Shaw went ideologically into reverse , but that he went intellectually clean off the road . <P> The play 's essential conflict , or confrontation , is no less vital than it is fascinating . Opposed to the Salvation Army 's idealistic , intransigent Barbara , a saver of souls , is her hardheaded munitions-making father , Andrew Undershaft , a destroyer of bodies . But the savers of souls , Barbara learns , are kept in funds by the destroyers of bodies . She further learns that her Merchant-of-Death father is an absolutely model boss , who regards poverty as the greatest of crimes and to thousands has proved a Bringer of Life . <P> Undershaft 's moral value does not stop with his offering one of the most trenchant of all indictments of poverty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute positions , in his showing how good and evil must always jostle and even beget one another . But Shaw , with his new non-reformer 's zeal , turns extremist .
