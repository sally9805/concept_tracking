Dawn on a dueling ground in the woods of France . A FRENCH OFFICER and his SECOND are at one end of the dueling ground , KORSAKOV and IBRAHIM are at the other . IBRAHIM holds his hat in hand , brimming over with fresh cherries . A cloth is wrapped around his head to cover a scar from a wound . KORSAKOV Ibrahim , I beg you , put off this madness . Do n't fight . Do n't do it . HANNIBAL I will have that man 's discretion or I will have his life . KORSAKOV What gossip can any man make that 's worth taking his life ? Or maybe losing your own ? HANNIBAL You know , Korsakov , that this is more than just a matter of my own honor . KORSAKOV Ibrahim , you poor fool . What do you need with that kind of honor . You 're too good for that . Why do you persist in dueling ? It 's endless , Ibrahim . HANNIBAL What is it brother ? Have you never done this before ? KORSAKOV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time is the hardest . Listen Korsakov . You hear the birds singing ? And smell how heavy the dew is . The sun will be up soon . Can you feel your heart beating ? Feel the blood rushing through your veins ? My mouth is dry , my stomach upset , my hands are shaking . I have nowhere else to go now , but oblivion . Yet somehow , I feel confident , cheerful , energetic , unafraid . I stopped to pick these cherries from the trees . I have a taste in my mouth for cherries . Would you like some cherries , Korsakov ? p. 3 KORSAKOV No , Ibrahim , I have no stomach for cherries . I have no stomach for this . This is madness . How can you risk your life , or maybe kill a complete stranger over a woman you can never have . A married woman and a nobleman 's wife no less . HANNIBAL Because it gives me pleasure just to be in the same room with her , to look at her , to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? KORSAKOV He only slanders her because she spends her idle hours with you . This has nothing to do with her . It 's your reputation he 's after . He only wishes to make a name for himself . HANNIBAL Then we shall carve it out for him in blood . FRENCH OFFICER Well are we ready ? Can we begin now ? You were already late . We thought perhaps you had lost your pistols , and were still at home sharpening your spear . The FRENCH OFFICER &amp; THE SECOND laugh HANNIBAL Sorry . I was picking cherries off the trees and lost track of the time . SECOND Before we begin I must ask you gentlemen to reconsider . Is there any possibility of reconciliation between you ? HANNIBAL No . None . FRENCH OFFICER On that we agree . p. 4 KORSAKOV Gentlemen , I warn you . This man is the protege of Peter the Great , the Czar of Russia . FRENCH OFFICER Then the Czar will have to find some other black , sooty toy to amuse himself . A monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so red and ripe now , so delicious . Would you like one ? FRENCH OFFICER No thank you . I would rather put a pistol ball in your heart . SECOND It seems there can be no peace between you . Therefore let me read you the terms of the duel . " The terms of the duel between the parties . . . HANNIBAL Mention no names . It is the indiscretion and misuse of names which brings us here . I do n't care who he is . Describe him as nobody . You may indicate me as anybody . But there will be no names . SECOND The terms of the duel between parties who must be nameless . The terms and the rules , they are simple . You will go to your places and stand your ground . On the first command you will cock and ready your weapons . On the second command you will aim your weapons . When I drop this handkerchief , and it touches the ground , consider that the command to fire your weapons . Once the two parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will begin again , and again , until the affair of the duel has been satisfied . Are there any questions ? Gentlemen , take your ground please . Ready ! Aim ! SECOND drops a white handkerchief . IBRAHIM and THE FRENCH OFFICER aiming at one another prepare to fire . Blackout . Spotlight on the handkerchief . Lights up on the home of Countess Leonora in Paris . IBRAHIM picks up the handkerchief . ENTER COUNTESS LEONORA p. 5 COUNTESS LEONORA Ibrahim my love , my heart . HANNIBAL Where is everyone ? COUNTESS LEONORA They 're all inside , listening to him go on and on about one thing or the other . Oh , how I 've missed you . HANNIBAL Leonora , we have to talk . COUNTESS LEONORA I do n't want to talk , I do n't want to think , I just want to feel you . HANNIBAL Listen to me Leonora . I met a young French cavalry officer in the field this morning . COUNTESS LEONORA Not another duel ? You 're not hurt are you ? HANNIBAL And it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glove . COUNTESS LEONORA Tell me you 're not hurt . HANNIBAL He insulted you . COUNTESS LEONORA Ibrahim , how could you ? I begged you , never to defend me . A scandal will dishonor me more than any insult . Or what if something should happen to you ? I do n't want you risking your life for my sake . HANNIBAL A soldier 's world is not polite society . A pistol ball was the only way to assure his discretion . COUNTESS LEONORA Is he dead ? p. 6 HANNIBAL What does it matter ? It only proves that I have to go . COUNTESS LEONORA Go ? What do you mean you have to go ? Go where ? HANNIBAL I 've received a letter from the Czar . He wants me to return to Russia . COUNTESS LEONORA But the Czar has sent you these letters before , and you did n't leave then . HANNIBAL Sooner or later your husband is bound to discover us . What if he should call me out ? COUNTESS LEONORA He would n't dare . He knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fate always has a hand to play in these things Leonora . But whatever it is , whatever his fears , whatever his feelings , he 's a gentleman . He has no choice . He must protect his honor . COUNTESS LEONORA Then you must refuse him . HANNIBAL My honor is as precious to me as his . My honor is all I have . What else is there to stand between me and complete oblivion , but my honor ? I have neither a title or lands . I receive an allowance like some fop . I 'm the Czar 's Negro . I can barely claim my own name . My uniform is thread bare . I 'm wretched . And this society , this frivolous society persecutes , pitilessly persecutes everything it claims it will allow in theory . It 's just a matter of time before that cold , pompous derision , the insinuations , the deceit , will catch up to us . And what will become of us then ? Then you will become ashamed of me . Of us . Then your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEONORA Fascination ? You ca n't really believe that I could ever feel that way ? About you ? I thought you knew me . It is n't fascination . I love you Ibrahim . You , for yourself . HANNIBAL Then how can you pretend that baby in there , that changeling is your son ? You and the Count . While to stop a scandal , our boy lives some miserable life somewhere , with some peasant woman , who we do n't even know who she is . COUNTESS LEONORA Please Ibrahim , do n't make me talk about him . Do n't make me remember our son . I do n't want to think about him . I ca n't . And I can barely look at that child in there now as it is . And the Count is convinced it 's the spitting image of him . HANNIBAL I saw him today . COUNTESS LEONORA You saw him ? Who ? Our son ? HANNIBAL Yes . I went there just after the duel . COUNTESS LEONORA How is he Ibrahim ? HANNIBAL He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hovel in the worst part of Paris . I found him suckling at his new mother 's breast . He 's not as dark as he was when he was a born . He 's a little fawn colored now . His hair is curly and he has your eyes . I named him Abrashka . COUNTESS LEONORA Abrashka ? What kind of name is Abrashka ? p. 8 HANNIBAL It 's a Russian name . COUNTESS LEONORA Ibrahim , I was in despair , in utter misery . It all seemed so hopeless . We were going to be ruined . There was nothing else we could do . I know you think it was frivolous and capricious of me Ibrahim , but a woman must secure her future in any way she can . But that has nothing to do with love . HANNIBAL There it is Leonora . Do n't you see ? You can not leave your husband . You 're safe . You have nothing to gain by being with me , and I have everything to lose . COUNTESS LEONORA We just have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be more discreet this time . HANNIBAL Leonora I have to go . COUNTESS LEONORA But why do you have to go ? And what will I do when you 're gone to half savage Russia ? What will I think about , or look forward to , or dream of , if not for you ? Of all the things that stand between us , why must you always put yourself in our way ? Why do you behave as if it were just you ? As if you 're the one who 's always alone ? HANNIBAL Because I am always alone . An aloneness both vivid and terrifying . It 's all I 've ever known . We must see that Abrashka has an allowance . COUNTESS LEONORA Yes Ibrahim . I will see to it . My maid knows where the woman lives . We will see that he is provided for . Oh , what will become of you my little Abrashka ? p. 9 COUNT L. Off Stage Leonora ! COUNTESS LEONORA Coming ! COUNT L. Off Stage Leonora ! ! COUNTESS LEONORA Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . ENTER THE MARQUIS MERVILLE MARQUIS MELVILLE Ibrahim . I did n't see you come in . Welcome . Countess , your husband has been calling for you . COUNTESS LEONORA Excuse me , Ibrahim . EXIT LEONORA . MARQUIS MELVILLE Look at her . Is n't she lovely ? Of course she 's no longer in that first flower of her youth , but still , she 's a beautiful woman . You know the story as well as I do . She came out of the convent and was married off to the Count when she was only seventeen . She 's never learned to love him , and he makes no effort to teach her . Remember what I told you before , Ibrahim ? That love without hopes or demands is more certain to capture a woman 's heart than all the calculations of seduction . Well , was I right ? Did you have her ? HANNIBAL Careful what you say from here on , Marquis . I happen to be a very good shot . MARQUIS MELVILLE Yes , so I have heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . The pistol ball shattered his wrist , so I 'm told . To shoot a wavering hand at twenty paces , it 's remarkable . And that 's not the only reason that you 're the attraction of Paris . Why I imagine you get more invitations to Parisian salons than Montesquieu or Fontenelle , or even that young upstart Voltaire . All the ladies of Paris wish to be the hostess to " Le Negre du Czar . " Yet he is always here . Why ? p. 10 HANNIBAL I envy men who are in no way remarkable at all . I consider insignificance a blessing . That gentleman who presented me with his glove and who is now left handed , he also took an offensive interest in the affairs of Le Negre du Czar . MARQUIS MELVILLE Forgive me , Captain Petrovich , but I am very proud to be a coward . I was only trying to say that I think the Countess has enchanted you . COUNT L. ( off stage ) Ibrahim ! Marquis ! Come have a look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's have a look at our new baby boy . IBRAHIM and MERVILLE go inside . A MAID SERVANT holds the baby for all to see . COUNT L. The whole of the ritual of fatherhood was bereft me . No running for the doctor , no pacing in the halls , no distress , none of it . The Countess is in the agonies of labor , and I 'm off shooting ducks in the countryside . MARQUIS MELVILLE Well , I should at least hope you were there for the conception . COUNT L. Yes Marquis , I seemed to have benefited from only the best of it . Welcome Ibrahim . I did n't see you come in . I was just about to tell Korsakov and Madame DuBois how you stood in for me at the birth . p. 11 MARQUIS MELVILLE Ibrahim , what a thoughtful fellow . Very accommodating . And extremely attentive to the Countess . But tell me , Count , how is it you were duck hunting while your wife is giving birth ? COUNT L. It was Leonora 's idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least little thing distresses her . The sight of blood ? The thought of her in pain ? I would have been altogether useless and in the way . MARQUIS MELVILLE Indeed , you may have . MADAME DUBOIS Is n't he beautiful , Korsakov ? I 'll wager you were like that once . You are a little like that now . KORSAKOV You are so wicked Madame DuBois . MADAME DUBOIS Oh , how you flatter me , Korsakov MARQUIS MELVILLE Congratulations , Count . You are a lucky man . A beautiful wife , a lovely new baby , wealth , influence , your home and your honor intact . What more could you ask ? COUNT L. Thank you , Marquis . Darling , come have a look at our son . COUNTESS LEONORA I see him quite enough , darling . Let our friends have a chance to look at him . COUNT L. Here , Nurse , let me have him . Jean Paul , come and see Ibrahim . Remember Ibrahim , Jean Paul . p. 12 HANNIBAL He 's a fine looking boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A captain in the artillery . He 's a Russian soldier in the French army . He 's a Negro , godson of the Czar . COUNTESS LEONORA Count , please . COUNT L. I 'm sorry , Ibrahim . I did n't mean anything . Here hold him . Hold Jean Paul . MARQUIS MELVILLE Seems as if there is a new man born in Europe . Would n't you say Ibrahim ? Tell us , which of the happy couple you think he resembles the most ? MADAME DUBOIS Speaking of something new , Captain Petrovich , shame on you . Why did n't you tell us that your good friend Korsakov was such a marvelously talented person ? I did n't know he was a handsome young poet . KORSAKOV Thank you , Madame DuBois , but I am not really a poet . I am an improvisator . An improviser . MADAME DUBOIS An improviser ? An improviser . An improvisator . Oh , it sounds so stimulating . KORSAKOV Yes , you see my poems are all extemporaneous inspirations of the moment . The spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone in the air , we can never catch them again . I never write them down . All I require is your participation . My audience is my muse . Simply give me a theme . A hidden secret . A lost desire . Some wild , wanton thought lying deep in your mind . And I will improvise a poem of it . We will need pen and paper . Write down your themes , and we will then have Madame DuBois pick one out by lot . THE MAID SERVANT dispenses quill and paper , and the GUESTS write down their themes . p. 13 MARQUIS MELVILLE Ibrahim , you are very quiet tonight . You 're not yourself , my old African friend . Countess Leonora , do you remember the first time I introduced you to Captain Petrovich ? COUNTESS LEONORA Yes Marquis , I do . You were rude as usual . He introduced poor Ibrahim as Peter the Great 's Negro . I told Ibrahim not to be shocked , he often introduces me as if I were the Count 's property . COUNT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not my property . MARQUIS MELVILLE Louis XIV ate with his hands , we all could do with more manners . But still , when you met , there was a look in your eyes , the two of you . COUNTESS LEONORA Count , do n't you see how awkward Ibrahim is . Jean Paul is only an infant . COUNT L. Yes , I suppose a baby is an awkward thing in a soldier 's arms . Do you want to hold him Leonora ? COUNTESS LEONORA Yes , give him to me . I 'll hold him . COUNT L. Give Jean Paul to the Countess , Ibrahim . COUNTESS LEONORA Thank you , Ibrahim . HANNIBAL Yes , Countess . MADAME DUBOIS Well , Korsakov , you have your themes . May I choose your improvisation now ? p. 14 KORSAKOV Yes , of course . MADAME DUBOIS chooses a paper from an urn and gives it to KORSAKOV . KORSAKOV The theme on this paper is , " Cleopatra and her lover " . Would the writer please explain this thought to me. ( pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme ? MARQUIS MELVILLE Well , if no one will confess , neither will I. But I will suggest what it might be . Cleopatra was like a queen bee to her lovers . Was n't death the price of her love ? Yet there were lovers who did not hesitate to pay the price , for the sake of their passion for her . KORSAKOV Yes , I see . Thank you , Marquis . ( KORSAKOV composes his thoughts and begins . ) Twilight O ' morning twilight O ' golden twilight When comes the dawn The dew is heavy , my heart is beating My blood is rushing , all fast and warm This day in the shade of a cherry tree A young love dies with the death of me This is the price for love I 'll pay My life like a trifle , I 'll throw away And give it to her , a small gift from me A life that was for her to command Even though she could never see That she held a life in the palm of her hand Better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild and sweet Then to see her grow a gray haired girl Who crushes dreams beneath her feet And while the darkness crawls around me This summer morning in the wood I know that the dark is only dark To be conquered by the good . p. 15 MADAME DUBOIS Wonderful , Korsakov . Very good . KORSAKOV Thank you , Madame DuBois . COUNT L. Excellent . Astonishing . MARQUIS MELVILLE Bravo . Bravo , Korsakov . Bravo . KORSAKOV Thank you COUNT L. You are truly a man of inspiration , Korsakov . Poets labor for weeks to write such verse , and yet you take another person 's thoughts barely formed in their own thinking and make music of it . It 's astonishing . Leonora ? Ibrahim ? How did you like it ? You both seem so distracted this evening . You 've both barely said a word . How did you like Korsakov 's improvisation ? COUNTESS LEONORA Beautifully done , Korsakov . KORSAKOV Thank you , Countess . HANNIBAL It was very good , Korsakov . Thank you . KORSAKOV Thank you , Ibrahim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibrahim . Is there something the matter ? HANNIBAL I have sad news . At least the news is sad for me , in any case . I have orders from the Czar . I leave for Russia tonight . COUNTESS LEONORA Tonight ? p. 16 HANNIBAL Within the hour . COUNTESS LEONORA Jean Paul is waking up . Take him , nurse , before he starts to cry . COUNT L. This is sad news , Ibrahim . MARQUIS MELVILLE Tragic . Most unfortunate . COUNTESS LEONORA Tonight ? In an hour ? I had no idea you were leaving this soon . Through IBRAHIM 'S speech , we are transported from Paris to St. Peterbsurg in Russia . HANNIBAL Please . This is difficult enough . I ca n't stand goodbyes . Usually I just go away . I was going to write . I had n't the courage to tell you all until now . But I wanted to thank the Countess for her pure , spontaneous soul . Her passionate devotion and her boundless tenderness towards me , I shall never forget . When I first came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going from one ball to the other . You see , I was born in Abyssinia , a land where the night air is too sweet to sleep in , and my brother Korsakov and I , we are Russians , and we Russians can dance forever . But it 's difficult being a foreigner . You stand out . Everyone immediately thinks they know who you are . And once they see you , they will never accept anything else about you other than what they think they see . It was only in Countess Leonora 's salon that I found friendship , and a place to be myself , and not Le Negre du Czar . I will not dishonor myself with tears . These memories must last me for a long time . Perhaps forever . Memories to carry me on the long journey ahead . Memories to carry me through memories . Through France , the Austrian Netherlands , the Holy Roman Empire , Saxony , Poland , and from Prussia , to the Russian frontier . And then on to St. Petersburg , a journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . It 's just turning autumn now . The thick woods of birch trees along the River Neva are wearing their winter shadows , and in the orchards at Oranienbaum , the apples are falling to the ground . St Petersburg . In the heart of my homeland , Holy Mother Russia , where they will welcome me like a prodigal son . Bring me the rest of my baggage footman . p. 17 THE SERVANT / IVAN I do n't know that I should , sir . HANNIBAL What ? THE SERVANT / IVAN My instructions from the Czar were to bring you here . There was nothing said about your baggage . Enter PETER THE GREAT . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Aha , Ibrahim ! Ibrahim Petrovich Hannibal . How is my godson ? Look at you . It seems not long ago you were no bigger than a pig , and now look at you . A handsome young man from abroad , and a captain no less . Paris was good to you ? And the women ? The women ? And dueling ? I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to tell me all about it . THE SERVANT / IVAN Shall I bring in this man 's baggage , your highness ? CZAR PETER THE GREAT Beating THE SERVANT / IVAN with his cane . Yes , you lout . This man is a gentleman . He 's my godson . Is this how you treat him , as if he were a Turk ? THE SERVANT / IVAN No , your majesty . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Are you hurt ? THE SERVANT / IVAN No , your majesty . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Striking THE SERVANT / IVAN again . What ? p. 18 THE SERVANT / IVAN Yes , your majesty . It hurts . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Well , let that be a lesson to you . Bring in Captain Petrovich 's baggage . And be careful you do n't strain yourself . THE SERVANT / IVAN Yes your majesty . THE SERVANT / IVAN exits . CZAR PETER THE GREAT That servant is a fool . But I love him . . . . And your wound . Your wound in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A good wound is a good honor . Wear it proudly . Do you still carry those pistols I gave you . HANNIBAL Yes , godfather . I practice everyday . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Without practice the steady hand loses its cunning . Still a good shot , I 'll wager . Where are they ? In this bag ? . . . . Oh , they are beautiful , are they not , Ibrahim Petrovich ? Still want them ? HANNIBAL Yes , godfather , I do . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Are they loaded ? HANNIBAL Of course , godfather , I was crossing the frontier . Enter THE SERVANT / IVAN with bags CZAR PETER THE GREAT Good . Choose . It 's tight in here , so we 'll have to settle for ten little paces . Close range , that takes nerve . Give me your back . You there , put down those bags and count off ten paces . p. 19 THE SERVANT / IVAN But , your majesty . . . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Count ! THE SERVANT / IVAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money I sent you sufficient ? THE SERVANT / IVAN Two . . . HANNIBAL Yes , godfather , most generous . THE SERVANT / IVAN Three . . . CZAR PETER THE GREAT The letter I sent you , Ibrahim . . . THE SERVANT / IVAN Four . . . CZAR PETER THE GREAT I did not intend to put the least pressure on you . THE SERVANT / IVAN Five . . . HANNIBAL I know , godfather . THE SERVANT / IVAN Six . . . CZAR PETER THE GREAT I would never forsake my protege . THE SERVANT / IVAN Seven . . . HANNIBAL Or I you , godfather . THE SERVANT / IVAN Eight . . . CZAR PETER THE GREAT It is completely up to you whether you remain in Russia or not . p. 20 THE SERVANT / IVAN Nine . . . HANNIBAL I have decided to come home , godfather . THE SERVANT / IVAN Ten ! CZAR PETER THE GREAT Good . THE SERVANT / IVAN Turn ! PETER turns and aims . CZAR PETER THE GREAT I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IVAN Aim ! HANNIBAL I would die before dishonoring you , godfather . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Welcome home , Ibrahim Petrovich . Enter MENSHIKOV , LIZA and NATALYA . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Alexander ! You are just in time . We were just about to shoot holes into each other . My trusted advisor Prince Alexander Menshikov , you know my godson , the little Negro page Ibrahim Petrovich . Now , he is a Captain returned from France . I wish you not to quarrel with him . Besides , he 's the best shot in this room . MENSHIKOV Captain Petrovich HANNIBAL Prince Menshikov . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Liza ! Come ! Bring your friend . Come you little fresh roses , come . Liza , do you remember the little Negro boy who used to steal apples for you , from my garden in Oranienbaum ? Well , here he is. p. 21 HANNIBAL You still seem very shy , and very full in your cheeks . Like an apple . Are you still fond of apples . MENSHIKOV Liza is my wife . LIZA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still get little boys to go into the Czar 's garden to fetch them for me . This is my friend , Natalya Gavrilovna . Natalya , this is an old friend , Ibrahim Petrovich Hannibal . RZHEVSKY It is a pleasure to meet you , sir . HANNIBAL On the contrary , the pleasure is all mine . Had I but remembered that there was such beauty in Russia , I would have left Paris long ago . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Listen to him . Has my godson been to Paris or not . Are you , Ibrahim ? Ready to drink and get yourself drunk ? There is plenty of malmsey wine and vodka ! I want to make a toast to Ibrahim . Aha , godson , welcome home to Holy Mother Russia . LIZA Tell us all about Paris , Ibrahim . HANNIBAL I wish I had a good report of Paris . As always the outward show of the Parisian gentlemen is serene and harmonious , pious , yet witty , courageous and disdainful of passionate excesses . But , in truth Parisians are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke of Orleans lives only for amusements and pleasure . The orgies of the Palais-Royal were no secret in Paris . There is greed , dissipation , low moral standards and squandered estates lost at the gaming tables . p. 22 LIZA It sounds perfectly terrible . His majesty must take us all there at once . What else Ibrahim ? HANNIBAL There are balls every night , and operas , and satirical vaudevilles everywhere . RZHEVSKY And what do they wear ? HANNIBAL Wear ? Why , they have less things underneath their dresses than Russian women do and their neck lines are very low . RZHEVSKY Touching her breasts . Oh . HANNIBAL Even lower still . RZHEVSKY Oh . MENSHIKOV And did you like Paris , Captain Petrovich ? HANNIBAL Yes , I liked Paris very much . MENSHIKOV Then why did you leave ? HANNIBAL To come home . MENSHIKOV To come home ? HANNIBAL Yes , to come home . It marvels me , every time people ask me , " where are you from ? " , and I say Russia . And they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . But I am Russian . This is my homeland . LIZA I remember when we were children , the games we used play , in exchange for your apples . They were always imaginary adventures in far off lands . Strange , magical , mysterious places . Happiness is so easy when you 're a child , and still sometimes we waste it . That was your homeland when you were a boy . A little boy 's memory of home , that 's where your home is Ibrahim , with that little boy . p. 23 HANNIBAL Well , then home and that little boy are gone . Russia is my homeland now . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Well said , godson . The reason he left Paris was because it was my order . Now , I want to make another toast . To the newly promoted Ibrahim Petrovich to the rank of Lieutenant-Captain in the Artillery Company of the Preobrazhensky Regiment . In which I myself am only a bombardier . LIZA Congratulations , Ibrahim . HANNIBAL Thank you , Liza . RZHEVSKY All the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most kind , Natalya Gavrilova , kind as you are beautiful . MENSHIKOV nods his head . HANNIBAL Thank you Prince Menshikov . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Ladies , you must leave us now . I wish to speak to my godson in private . No , you stay Alexander . But , ladies you must go . LIZA , and NATALYA bow and EXIT CZAR PETER THE GREAT So , what has really made you finally return to Russia , my godson ? Certainly not my letters bidding you to come home . HANNIBAL Your last letter touched me deeply , godfather . p. 24 CZAR PETER THE GREAT Yes , especially since you were spending your mornings thinning out the Parisian army . HANNIBAL Excuse me , your majesty ? CZAR PETER THE GREAT I have heard from the Duke of Orleans . He says you have made a habit of shooting his officers . HANNIBAL Only in defense of my honor , godfather . CZAR PETER THE GREAT You sound like an aristocrat . What did they do ? Call you names ? HANNIBAL One in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the Czar uses to amuse himself . CZAR PETER THE GREAT What ? And you killed him of course ? HANNIBAL No , godfather , but he will have to learn to shoot a pistol and use his sword with his left hand now . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Good . He will suffer to tell others that Russia will not be dishonored . But come now Ibrahim , tell me straight brother . What was all of this dueling all about ? HANNIBAL It 's difficult for me to say , godfather . I simply seemed to be drawn into them . I have been called out either because I am a Russian , or because of the color of my skin . The pretexts were many , but they all amounted to the same thing . p. 25 CZAR PETER THE GREAT Were these Frenchmen really offending you , or was it your pride ? HANNIBAL There is something in what you say , sire . But I could hardly be the one to know , because it was always a matter of honor . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least until now , when I have only just stopped . CZAR PETER THE GREAT And make certain that it has " stopped , " brother . There will be no dueling in Russia . The penalty for the survivor is death . HANNIBAL You have my word , godfather , my dueling days are no more . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Good . We have great plans for you , Ibrahim . But first we must teach you about politics . After more than twenty years of war , we now have peace . All those years of defeat after defeat by the Swedes , they have finally taught us how to defeat them . Once we were the nobodies of Europe , now we are among the family of nations . Now when the monarchs of Europe consider the balance of powers , they must put Russia on the scale . The Baltic is open to us now . We have a window to the sea . Livonia and Estonia are ours . Poland is our cousin . France and Prussia are our new allies . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the moment . The Turks are a formidable enemy , Ibrahim , a nation of men who all look like you . The ambassador who stole you from the Turkish palace is getting very old and feeble . You have some knowledge of the place . You would make an excellent ambassador yourself . But that is for the future . For now I want you to take over as the engineer for the fortifications at Kronstadt . We must be as powerful in peace as we were in war . And it will do good for our fat , lazy nobles to take their orders from an Arab . It will teach them a lesson . Show them how a subject earns his place . p. 26 HANNIBAL Yes , sire . Thank you . CZAR PETER THE GREAT You will need a place to yourself . We will set you up were you lived in summers as a boy , in Mon Plaisir . Would you like that ? HANNIBAL Yes , sire . Thank you . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Menshikov , you will excuse us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem out of spirits and melancholy . You make chit-chat like a Parisian . Tell me straight , what is the matter ? HANNIBAL Nothing . Everything is perfectly fine , sire . I 'm glad to be home . I look forward to my new duties . I could wish for nothing more . CZAR PETER THE GREAT You must never be too satisfied , Ibrahim . It will kill your ambition . Now out with it . What is it that 's troubling you ? Is it your lover in Paris ? Countess Leonora ? You miss her ? HANNIBAL My lover , sire ? CZAR PETER THE GREAT Come now , Ibrahim . I am the Czar . I have informers everywhere . It 's the Czar 's business to know everything . If she were just any French woman , you could bring her here with us . But for a subject of mine to break up the marriage of a favorite of the Regent of France , is not good for Russia just now . p. 27 HANNIBAL I had no such intentions , sire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREAT Good . Now , if this is why you are depressed , I think I know how to cheer you up . That young girl who was with Liza before , Natalya Gavrilovna , did you like her ? HANNIBAL She was very charming , sire . CZAR PETER THE GREAT And beautiful . HANNIBAL And beautiful . CZAR PETER THE GREAT And modest and poised . HANNIBAL And smart . CZAR PETER THE GREAT You go too far , brother . But , who knows , perhaps she is smart . How would you like to get to know her better ? HANNIBAL That would be very nice , sire . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Then you shall have her . We will marry her to you . HANNIBAL Marriage ? But , sire , the girl , she does n't even know me . And her parents , how could they agree to a marriage with a complete stranger . CZAR PETER THE GREAT A girl must obey her parents , and they must obey me . I will take care of the parents . The girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great Lykov and Rzhevsky families . Marrying Natalya will give you a title and land . p. 28 HANNIBAL But godfather , how could they except someone like me , in such a family ? CZAR PETER THE GREAT Why not ? There 's nothing amiss with you . They will be honored by whatever match I choose . What a curious thing to say . It 's just as I thought . Paris has softened your brain . That is why I 've brought this gentleman here to teach you something Ibrahim . I hope you have n't forgotten your old duties . Take up that slate and an abacus over there , and have a seat . Menshikov ! ENTER MENSHKO MENSHIKOV Yes sire . CZAR PETER THE GREAT I am informed by the Governor of the Ukraine that there are as much as fifteen thousand serfs missing from our tax rolls . Are they all in the army ? MENSHIKOV No , your majesty , there are no new recruits in the Ukraine . Not fifteen thousand . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Well , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy four kopecks for each of the fifteen thousand serfs . How many kopecks is that , Ibrahim ? HANNIBAL Over a million kopecks , sire . CZAR PETER THE GREAT A million kopecks ? Menshikov ? MENSHIKOV Your majesty ? p. 29 CZAR PETER THE GREAT You know everything that goes on in St. Petersburg . You have informers . Do you know who this thief is ? This traitor who is robbing Russia ? Perhaps he 's the new owner of the old Mazeppa estate . There would be fifteen thousand serfs on the Mazeppa estate . If we find who is the new lord of Mazeppa 's estate , we may have ourselves someone to hang . Do you know who he is ? You do n't have to tell me his name . Just tell me that you know who he is . MENSHIKOV All right , I confess . It was me . The serfs are mine . I took Mazeppa 's estate in payment for his debts . All right taxes . I took his land , why not ? I work for the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no expense . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Where are the serfs now ? MENSHIKOV The serfs are all over . Some here in St. Petersburg , some are at my palace in Moscow , some in Riga , they 're everywhere . And I have n't paid taxes on a single one . Not a soul . I confess . But , before you punish me , just remember what Yaguzhinsky said , when you threatened to hang him and all corrupt officials . " So you wish to be alone , sire , without any subjects but the serfs ? " My Lord , everyone does it . Everyone . Why punish me ? CZAR PETER THE GREAT Everyone ? You must be careful I do n't ask you who they are . You will remember that I did hang Yaguzhinsky . Here , take my staff Ibrahim . I want you to cane the Prince . And if you do not lay it on him hard , I will have the Prince cane you . Place your hands on the chair , Menshikov . Menshikov , you are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IBRAHIM begins to cane THE PRINCE on his bottom ) I have made you Most Serene Prince ! Duke of Izhora ! Count of Dubrovna , Gorki , and Potchep ! Sovereign of Oranienbaum and Baturin ! General , admiral , governor of St. Petersburg . You , a pastry cook ! And you steal from me ! PETER stops IBRAHIM with a wave of his hand . Let that be a lesson to you . Ibrahim , mark Prince Menshikov down for a million kopecks. p. 30 MENSHIKOV Forgive me , sire , but you will remember that I 'm giving a small gathering at my palace , in a month or two , to celebrate the coming of our Russian winter . I should like to invite Lieutenant-Captain Petrovich . I would be most honored if he would attend . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Yes , brother , it would be good if you were there . HANNIBAL Yes , Prince Mensikov , I will come . Thank you . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Leave us for now , Alexander . I will see you later . MENSKIKOV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a formidable enemy . He was humiliated . And of course he will not take his spite out on me . His invitation was a declaration of war , you know . HANNIBAL Why did you do that , godfather ? CZAR PETER THE GREAT Because in certain matters , I must do with you as I have to do with all the Russian people . Drag you into the modern world , kicking and screaming . There is a great war within this peace we are having . And , as in war , you must secure allies , hold what ground you have , and look to the future . Besides , it is putting people at each other that gives a Czar his power . With Menshikov for your enemy , you will have to be a very careful soldier . p. 31 HANNIBAL Sire , I am happy in your majesty 's favor and patronage . I pray God that I may never outlive my Czar and benefactor . I wish for nothing more . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Listen to me , Ibrahim . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stranger here to everyone but me . What if I should die tomorrow ? What would become of you then ? You must get settled while there is still time . Find support in new ties . Be allied to Russian nobility . That is why you must marry this girl . HANNIBAL Sire , I was just a young man when I went to France . I really am a stranger here . I need time to think . To get settled . CZAR PETER THE GREAT I will give you time to think . In the meantime I will get Liza to probe the girl . Very discreetly mind you . We will arrange a few meetings and the rest is up to you . You have been to Paris , you know what to do . HANNIBAL As you wish , sire . CZAR PETER THE GREAT I do wish it . Look , Ibrahim , godson , brother . There are men like Prince Menshikov , who was nothing more than a pastry cook and pie seller on the streets . These men rule worlds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right time . This is that time for you . HANNIBAL Yes , sire . I see . BLACK OUT p. 32 Act 1 , Scene 2 LIGHTS UP ON The study at Mon Plaisir . IVAN This is the study . The fireplace works best here . It 's the warmest room in Mon Plaisir . HANNIBAL Yes , I know . The Czar is my godfather . And as a boy , in summers , I lived here . And often slept in this very room . Why you can see the Gulf of Finland through those windows . IVAN You lived here with the Czar ? HANNIBAL Is that strange to you ? IVAN No . It is as you say , sir . But it has always been my understanding that Mon Plaisir was for the strict use of the Czar 's family and only his closest friends . HANNIBAL I say he is my godfather man . Is this the new uniform ? IVAN Yes it is . HANNIBAL " Yes it is , my lord . " IVAN Yes it is . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me try it on . IVAN It does n't seem to suit you somehow . HANNIBAL Truly ? Listen , whenever you utter even a single word to me , you will follow it by the words , " my lord " . If this should become tedious for you , you may use " master " in its place , with a few " sirs " to give your speech some variety . Or Captain Petrovich . Your expressions will be about me and what I want , and how you are immediately about to accomplish that end . Is that clear ? p. 33 IVAN It does n't seem to suit you somehow . . . my lord . HANNIBAL What is your name ? IVAN My name is Ivan , my lord . HANNIBAL And where are you from , Ivan ? IVAN From Moscow , master . My family belongs to the Moscow estate of Prince Menshikov . HANNIBAL Menshikov ? And how came you to the Czar ? IVAN He saw me one day . He thought I was bright , and he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any idea , why the Czar has sent you to me ? IVAN No , my lord . The Czar is my master . I but obey his wish . HANNIBAL I will tell you why . The Czar wishes you to learn how to be more respectful to a Russian officer . IVAN May I speak freely , my lord ? HANNIBAL Yes , go on . IVAN You will forgive me , my lord , but a uniform does not make the man . I am Russian , which you are not . This is where I was born , and my family , and all their families before them . You can not become a Russian , you must be Russian to be worthy of the name . IBRAHIM goes to the pistol case and with powder , cap , and ball he loads the pistol . p. 34 HANNIBAL You are very proud , my friend . You are also , so very young . I have had many an early morning with proud boys like you . But being a peasant lackey , who has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly know your geography . Russia goes east to the Chinese Empire , south to the Ottoman Empire , west to Europe , and north to the ends of world . What it is to be a Russian shrinks and grows with time , my friend . Time . A thing which I could take from you , within a flash . Do you understand me , sir ? ( aiming his pistol at IVAN ) THE SERVANT / IVAN Yes my lord . THERE IS A POUNDING ON A DOOR IVAN Someone is at the door my lord . HANNIBAL Then you must go answer it . IVAN Yes my lord . IVAN EXITS IBRAHIM SMOLDERS IN HIS ANGER ENTER IVAN IVAN Forgive me , my lord , but a gentleman is waiting to see you . He refuses to give me his name . He says that it 's a surprise . IBRAHIM again aims at IVAN as KORSAKOV ENTERS . KORSAKOV Ibrahim , my friend , you must have more servants than you need to shoot them just because they ca n't keep an old friend from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing in St. Petersburg ? KORSAKOV Paris was n't as much fun after you left , always the same old thing . Here , I have a gift for you . HANNIBAL What is this ? KORSAKOV A book of my improvisations . Madame DuBois became my patron , among other things . She dragged me to every salon in Paris to do my improvisations . And do you know what ? She wrote them all down . Everyone . And then had them printed and sold in bookshops . And in the salons they demanded to hear my improvisations from this accursed book . I stopped being an improviser of fresh verse , and became a reader of yesterday 's tired , over worn words HANNIBAL I wish I had this book with me these past few months . It would have been like having you here . . . . You may go , Ivan . IVAN EXITS KORSAKOV So , what do you do , to keep yourself from dying of boredom in this barbarous St. Petersburg ? Do they have an opera house , at least ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salon . All we do here is work , sleep and drink Vodka . Let 's have a glass of vodka , Korsakov . A toast to your return to Russia . KORSAKOV Vodka . I ca n't believe it . . . . To tell you the truth Ibrahim , the reason I returned was because , like you , I received a letter from the Czar . Not a personal letter , like yours , but an official letter signed by some clerk . It seems they are rounding up all of the noblemen 's sons who were sent abroad for education . Remember , when they made us go , I did n't want to leave . Now , they want us back and I did n't want to return . I was never coming back here . p. 36 HANNIBAL But , Korsakov , this is your home . KORSAKOV This is n't my home . It 's just a place where I was born . I feel like a complete stranger here . I always have . And now after six years away , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a foreigner here . HANNIBAL I know . I feel the same way . KORSAKOV You could get out . You could go . HANNIBAL Go where ? KORSAKOV You could go back to where you were born . To Abyssinia . You must still have relatives there . HANNIBAL What would I do there ? I know less of that place than I do this . I would be even more of a stranger , in an even stranger way . KORSAKOV We 're trapped . HANNIBAL You must not look at it that way , Korsakov . The Czar has divested all distinction . In his court there are Germans , Poles , Dutch , English , me , a pastry cook . Today in Russia it dose n't matter whether we 're noblemen or foreigners . Whether we 're rich or we 're poor . What matters is how we serve , what we do . Deeds are our birthright now . KORSAKOV I do not doubt what you say , Ibrahim . But for me the fact is , that if I did not return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . My father is very old . I am just a poet . I can not support him . Without my pledge to the Czar , he would die in poverty . And therefore , for the sake of a life who has given me life , I am trapped in Russia . You must help me , Ibrahim . If I am to be trapped here , do n't let it be in the army . I would rather be a supercilious clerk in Siberia than a soldier in the army . p. 37 HANNIBAL What do you want me to do , Korsakov ? KORSAKOV Intercede for me . As a favorite of the Czar , get me a position where I do n't have to compromise my principles as a devout coward . HANNIBAL Of course , Korsakov . I 'll see what I can do . We 'll start working on it tonight . KORSAKOV Tonight ? HANNIBAL Yes , tonight there is a celebration at Prince Menshikov 's palace . The Czar will be there . I 'll introduce you , and simply tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solider . I 'm sure he 'll grant you something that 's not in the army . KORSAKOV Oh , thank you , Ibrahim . Thank you . HANNIBAL Anything for you , Korsakov . So , how is Paris ? KORSAKOV Our Paris friends send you their greetings , and they are sorry you are not with them . Otherwise it 's always the same old thing in Paris . There is no news except , the Countess sends you this letter . HANNIBAL And how is the Countess ? KORSAKOV Naturally , at first she was very much grieved by your departure and wanted you back at all cost . Then she gradually took comfort and found herself a new lover . p. 38 HANNIBAL A lover ? KORSAKOV Yes . Can you guess who he is ? HANNIBAL Who ? KORSAKOV The licentious Marquis Merville . HANNIBAL Merville ? It is n't true . It 's a lie . It has n't been more than a few months since I 've been gone . KORSAKOV Do you find it strange ? Do n't you know that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nature , to be grieved for very long ? Life goes on , Ibrahim . HANNIBAL It goes on endlessly , Korsakov . KORSAKOV You must n't take it so hard , brother . One can not rely on a woman 's fidelity . Those who do n't care or bother about it , are lucky . HANNIBAL You know , Korsakov , when the Turks attacked Abyssina and they stole me up , I watched my sister drown in the River Mareb , trying to swim after me . As a child , seven years old , before I was bought by the Czar 's ambassador , when it was fashionable to have clever little Negro boys at court , for a year I was the plaything to all the bored sultanas in the Sultan 's harem . Yet I still do n't know women . And now it seems that I am to be married . KORSAKOV Married ? p. 39 HANNIBAL Yes , to Russian nobility . A girl , named Natalya Gavrilovna has been promised to me by the Czar . Promised ? Did I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give away a pet cat . I do n't even know her . KORSAKOV Then you really are trapped . HANNIBAL Have you a place to stay ? KORSAKOV No , not yet . HANNIBAL Then , you must stay with me . KORSAKOV Thank you , Ibrahim . I would like that . Look , I see you have no thoughts to spare for me now . We 'll talk later to our heart 's content . If you 'll just point me the way , I 'll go and freshen up from my journey , and leave you to your letter . HANNIBAL Thank you , Korsakov . Ivan ! ENTER IVAN . IVAN Yes my lord . HANNIBAL Put this gentleman 's baggage in the room next to mine . IVAN Yes , my lord . KORSAKOV I 'll see you later , Ibrahim . Do n't forget to call on me for the gathering at Prince Menshikov 's . HANNIBAL I will call you , brother . KORSAKOV and IVAN exit . IBRAHIM reads the letter as we hear the voice of LEONORA. p. 40 COUNTESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since you 've been gone , the days are so long and so lonely . I miss so much your arrogant , aristocratic airs . Your anger , so loose and wild and sincere . The touch of your skin , the texture of your hair . Your sighs and your kisses . Once you said that my peace was more precious to you than anything . But how can my peace be precious when you are gone from me . I know that you were angry that I tried to detained you , to keep you from leaving me , and that you are very disappointed in me and the choices I have had to make . But , I want you to know , that in losing you , I lose the last joy in my life . And so goodbye my precious , my peace , my only friend . Think of me sometimes , and write to me from time to time , even though there is little hope of our ever seeing each other again . With all my heart , your ever loving Leonora . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IVAN Excuse me , my lord HANNIBAL What is it ? IVAN The Grand Duchess awaits your pleasure . HANNIBAL Grand Duchess ? Liza . Of course , show her in . ENTER LIZA . LIZA Ibrahim Petrovich Hannibal , shame on you . How could you be so cruel ? And to an old friend . You have been gone away for years , and in all these months since your return you have n't come to call on me , not even once . And now , I am the one who must sacrifice her pride and come to see you . Why should you be so angry with me ? p. 41 HANNIBAL No , not in the least Liza . Never could I be angry with you . LIZA Do you remember when we were children ? I did all I could do to get you to steal apples for me from the Czar 's garden , until I had more apples in my room than were on the trees . I adored you then . I adore you now , and this is how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive me . LIZA Well , only if you satisfy my curiosity . It was interesting to hear the things you had to say that first night about your years abroad . What was it like for you there in Paris , Ibrahim ? HANNIBAL Paris ? Paris was not very interesting . Always the same old thing in Paris . LIZA It seems interesting to someone who 's never been anywhere , but between St. Petersburg and Moscow . I envy you , Ibrahim . You 've been around the world . Seen so many things and had experience . HANNIBAL Thank you , Liza , but much of it was not very alluring . LIZA You must lie to me , Ibrahim . Tell me that every moment was completely and utterly romantic . That the only reason you returned , was because your happiness was more than you could bear . HANNIBAL It 's true , there were things I could no longer bear . And happiness was among them . Happiness is a very fickle mistress . p. 42 LIZA Yes , but she travels easily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in another . HANNIBAL I suppose that 's true . I 'll only be too glad when I put all of that past behind me . LIZA Not all the past , I should hope . Dreams and memories seem to me to be very useful things . They take you places you can not go , and places you dare not . They are there when you 're alone , and for a time can make you forget unhappiness ever existed . HANNIBAL You are still such a dreamy girl , are n't you , Liza ? LIZA It will be interesting for you to live here in Mon Plaisir once more , surrounded by your boyhood memories . You may come to see yourself as a completely new and unexpected person . HANNIBAL That is what I hope for Liza . We shall see . LIZA Well , enough about the past . I have news for your future . At the Czar 's behest I 've spoken to Natalya . HANNIBAL Spoken to Natalya about what ? LIZA Do n't worry , Ibrahim , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about you to feel her out . And she finds you fascinating . HANNIBAL Fascinating ? And what does she mean by fascinating ? p. 43 LIZA She thinks you are very good looking . And when I told her about all the hardships and adventures in your life , she was in awe . She kept saying it , " fascinating " . HANNIBAL I do n't understand Liza , what does she mean by fascinating ? LIZA Well , Ibrahim , she 's a young girl . She finds you attractive . She likes your manner and your appearance . HANNIBAL My appearance ? Liza , you 're being naive . LIZA It is you who are being naive , Ibrahim . Whether it is some fat Count , or some old , withered and aging Duke , or whoever it is , Natalya 's marriage will be arranged . Appearances are the least of her problems . Natalya would be very lucky to have you for a husband . HANNIBAL I do n't know , Liza , all this thinking about the future . I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . LIZA Right now your future is that the Czar means for you to marry Natalya for your own good . Still Natalya is very young . She 's just out of the convent . She has no experience . You will have to teach her how to love you , and you will have to wait for your pleasure until she learns . But , you are a man , a man of the world . You may look to other , more experienced women , until she does learn . p. 44 HANNIBAL You mean take a lover ? Marry Natalya and take a lover ? I could n't bear it . Liza , the intrigue would suffocate me . LIZA There are things far more suffocating than intrigues , Ibrahim . Life itself can be suffocating Sometimes we think too much about the future , and forget the moment . I think that people 's attraction for each other should be explored . Do n't you ? Obviously , there 's a reason for it . A connection , a need , something we want to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to share our confidences and to be tender with . I 've never had that with anyone , but you Ibrahim . I loved you then , I 've loved you always , I love you now HANNIBAL Liza , I do n't know what to say ? It 's not that I do n't want you . It 's just that I do n't know what I want . When you and I were children , playing together , touching each other , we were young and did n't know what we were doing . What could we have known about love ? You were destined to be a Duchess , and me , the Czar 's Negro . We are grown up now Liza . LIZA Men live in such perfect worlds . Ibrahim , listen to me . The wheels are in motion . There is no turning back for you now . I 've had the rare honor of having breakfast with my prince this morning , my husband and your good friend Prince Menshikov . And between his scrawling on bits of paper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was about you . He wanted to know about all your habits and your curiosities , your ambitions , your fears . He means to thwart you , Ibrahim , by whatever means within his power . And he has that power Ibrahim . The same power he has over you , as he has over me . We must be allies , Ibrahim . We must be friends . p. 45 HANNIBAL I have n't been home but for a few months , and it seems like everything I 've gone through before . Life is is nothing but duels and intrigues and war . I want no quarrel with Prince Menshikov , or you , or the Czar . I just want to come home . I need some peace , some time to think . LIZA And the Czar intends to stimulate your thinking . His majesty insists that at my husband 's gathering tonight , that everyone should dance the minuet . The minuet is very popular with the Germans these days . And as Natalya 's father hates the Germans , he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she will be disgraced . And therefore the Czar has ordered her to come to you and learn . HANNIBAL To come to me to learn the minuet for tonight ? LIZA She 's just outside , waiting in my carriage with her dancing master now . He 's a Swede , and they could hardly know how to do the minuet . HANNIBAL Liza , what are you doing ? LIZA I 'm trying to help you , Ibrahim . I 'm trying to be your friend . I 'm trying to tell you that , whenever you need me , whatever you need me for , I 'll always be there . I 'll go and get Natalya now . LIZA EXITS ( A PAUSE ) ENTER NATALYA. p. 46 RZHEVSKY Lieutenant-Captain Petrovich , thank you so much for taking the time , and being so kind as to teach me the minuet . I 'm sure you , who have been to Paris , must find it astonishing that a young lady of good family has no knowledge of such an elegant dance . But I assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Father simply would n't allow me to learn it . He thinks it 's just another vulgar habit we 've picked up from the Germans . Father is so old fashioned . But tonight , tonight the Czar himself , insists that I dance . Father was very grave about it at first . But how could he refuse the Czar . And so here I am . HANNIBAL It is an honor . But where is Liza ? I thought she was with you . RZHEVSKY The Grand Duchess has much to do to make ready for tonight . She sends her regrets . She looks forward to seeing you tonight and says that she was leaving me in very good hands . Her carriage will await us later . And it is a very fine carriage too . Oh , I almost forgot . This is my dancing master , Gustav Adamych . HANNIBAL Gustav Adamych ? RZHEVSKY He 's in the service of my father 's estate . ADAMYCH A pleasure to meet you my lord . HANNIBAL What 's wrong with your leg , Gustav Adamych @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my lord , a Russian hole . I was a soldier in the Swedish Army at the battle of Poltava . I was on the wrong side that day , and now I play music and teach dancing in St. Petersburg . HANNIBAL Better to live a long life as a crippled dancing master , than among your dead brothers in arms on the field of Poltava . ADAMYCH You have a very good point , my lord . RZHEVSKY Well , shall we begin . Gustav , watch closely , in case I forget any of my steps . ADAMYCH Yes , my lady . HANNIBAL The minuet is very simple really . We begin third position , left foot forward . Bend at the knees . Rise and step to the right . Bend again . Rise and step left . To the right . To the left . Good . Now , imagine the music and follow me . It is important that we look at each other at all times . And it is fashionable to engage in conversation while dancing . . . . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom in the minuet for the lady to choose a partner from among her admirers . As graceful and beautiful as you are , I 'm sure you have many admirers from which to choose . RZHEVSKY Well , there is Prince Dolgoruky , but my Aunt Tatyana says he is much too proud . Then , there are Shagin and Troekurov , who Auntie says are much too infected with the German spirit . Miloslavsky , she thinks is rich but stupid . And then there is Yeletsky , but Aunt Tatyana will have none of him . p. 48 HANNIBAL You are very popular , Natalya . Even more popular that your Aunt Tatyana . And which of these gentlemen do you prefer ? RZHEVSKY I am in complete agreement with my Aunt Tatyana . Were it my choice to choose , I would have none of them . If I could choose for myself , I would rather someone who was tall , dark and graceful , dashing and brave . A military man I think HANNIBAL Forgive me , but I thought we were speaking of dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it a game of love . How else is a young girl to know a man before they become husband and wife ? HANNIBAL And what if the Czar himself , should make this match for you ? RZHEVSKY The Czar ? Choose a match for me ? I would n't know what to think . Yet , if the Czar should make the match , what could I do but say yes . No , it 's too incredible . Father would be overjoyed . Aunt Tatyana would be ecstatic . Oh , please , Captain Petrovich , you must choose some other topic of conversation . This one is making me forget my steps . HANNIBAL Are you all right ? RZHEVSKY Yes . Only just let me catch my breath . IBRAHIM sits NATALYA in a chair . p. 49 HANNIBAL Gustav . There is water on the desk . GUSTAV brings the water to IBRAHIM . HANNIBAL Here , drink slowly . RZHEVSKY Lieutentant-Captain Petrovich , why do you wear that cloth around your head ? HANNIBAL This ? This is the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy in Abyssinia , in Africa . My mother weaved it for me . It used to fit around my waist . Now , it covers a wound , a scar from the war with Spain . RZHEVSKY Has n't it healed ? HANNIBAL Yes , but the scar is very ugly . RZHEVSKY May I see it ? HANNIBAL The scar is hideous , Natalya . RZHEVSKY Let me look . I wo n't be afraid . IBRAHIM removes the cloth . RZHEVSKY Oh , Ibrahim , how you must have suffered . HANNIBAL Getting the wound was less painful than being in a Spanish prison . They were particularly unkind to me . But that is long past now . Listen , Natalya , may I speak freely ? RZHEVSKY Yes Ibrahim , of course . ENTER KORSAKOV. p. 50 KORSAKOV Oh , I 'm sorry , Ibrahim . I had no idea you had company . And such beautiful company indeed . I only came down , because I thought it must be time to go to Prince Menshikov 's . HANNIBAL Not at all , Korsakov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I present my good friend Korsakov . RZHEVSKY Korsakov ? KORSAKOV Yes , Korsakov . And congratulations mademoiselle . RZHEVSKY Congratulations ? For what ? KORSAKOV On being betrothed by the Czar to my good brother here , Ibrahim Petrovich Hannibal . NATALYA faints . BLACK OUT @x A DRAWING ROOM ADJOING THE BALL ROOM IN THE MENSHIKOV PALACE KORSAKOV I 'm sorry Ibrahim . I had no idea . HANNIBAL It 's not your fault . How were you to know that she did n't even know she was engaged to me . KORSAKOV She was bound to discover it sooner or later . Under the best of circumstances it still would have been something of a shock . HANNIBAL Yes , that the sight of me makes her faint . Is this how I am to live my life ? I should have never come here . I should have stayed in Paris . KORSAKOV You were not so well off in Paris as here Ibrahim . HANNIBAL At least in Paris , I was free to defend myself . Here , nothing is real . I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll take this chance to intercede for you . ENTER PETER &amp; GAVRIL CZAR PETER THE GREAT Gavril Afanasyevich , my godson Lieutenant-Captain Ibrahim Petrovich . And who is this ?

HANNIBAL Thank you , prince . CZAR PETER THE GREAT You must call on your future father-in-law tomorrow . And make certain that you gratify his nobleman 's pride . Leave your carriage at the gate , and walk through the courtyard . Talk to him about his service to the state , how he defended the palace from the Streltsi when the Czar was just a boy , how it was his musket ball that struck Charles at Poltava . All you have to do is listen to him , and you will make a lasting impression , I assure you . p. 56 HANNIBAL Godfather , if I may be so bold . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she favors me .

MENSHIKOV So , Ivan , how is it having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , my lord . MENSHIKOV Well , here is a little something that might help to serve your spite . I want you to take this letter to my footman . He is to deliver it to the commander of my Horse Guards Regiment in Moscow . It is for the release and transfer of a soldier named Valeryan . My footman is to personally see this soldier and tell him discreetly that the love of his life is about to be married to the Czar 's Negro . Then we shall see if the young have any character . And if our aristocratic African duelist is as hot headed as he is hot blooded , we will have him in our snare . It 's time he felt the Czar 's wrath . Now go . IVAN EXITS ENTER LIZA . MENSHIKOV There is my lovely wife . Did you come to ask me to minuet ? LIZA It is expected of us . MENSHIKOV I thought you would be dancing with your old Negro friend , Hannibal . LIZA He already has a partner . MENSHIKOV Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czar has just betrothed her to him ? p. 58 LIZA Oh , what a surprise . MENSHIKOV It seems more like a pity to me . LIZA A pity ? Why a pity ? MENSHIKOV A pity for such a lovely girl to be married to a Negro . LIZA Would you prefer her to be married to a German ? MENSHIKOV I like Germans . Germans are white . LIZA It is easy to see , my lord , why you dwell on such distinctions , as judgements of personal character and true honor are complete mysteries to you . MENSHIKOV You seem to champion the Negro . Perhaps you are right , and soon we are all destined to be close friends . LIZA I think not , my prince . LIZA EXITS ENTER GAVRIL and TATYANA . MENSHIKOV Congratulations , Gavril Afanasyevitch . And you may expect many more surprises in the weeks ahead . MENSHIKOV EXITS RZHEVSKY Congratulations ? Surprises ? What is he talking about ? RZHEVSKY I do n't know what he means . He was here when I was talking with the Czar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me aside . Guess what he wanted . p. 59 RZHEVSKY My dear brother , how should I know ? I have no idea . Has he offered you a governorship somewhere , or an embassy ? RZHEVSKY No . It concerns Natalya . RZHEVSKY Natalya ? No ? She 's getting married , and the Czar is her match-maker . Am I right Gavrila ? Why are n't you happy ? You should be shouting to the roof . The Czar my niece 's match-maker . Who is he ? For whom did the Czar ask for Natalya 's hand . RZHEVSKY Who is he ? That 's just it . You would never guess in a million years . RZHEVSKY What is it Dolgoruky ? Shagin , Troekurov ? Oh , I hope not Troekurov . Miloslavsky ? Who ? RZHEVSKY No , none of them . RZHEVSKY Who is he then ? RZHEVSKY The Czar 's godson , Ibrahim Petrovich . RZHEVSKY The Negro ? You will kill her . The very sight of him is too much for her . You will kill her . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? RZHEVSKY He is no commoner . This man was the son of a sultan . So he was stolen , what of it ? It 's the fortunes of war . Of all the foreign monkeys that have come from abroad , he 's more of a man than any of them . And what will the Czar say ? How am I to refuse the Czar ? He promises us his favor , his protection . We are under his authority , and we must obey him in all things . p. 60 RZHEVSKY You will kill her . Kill her ; do you hear me ? RZHEVSKY Say what you will , I do n't intend to quarrel with the Czar . RZHEVSKY Oh dear God , what will become of the poor girl . Lord help and preserve us . Enter PETER , IBRAHIM , KORSAKOV , MENSKIKOV , LIZA , and NATALYA . PETER has KORSAKOV by the scruff of his neck . CZAR PETER THE GREAT You are caught , sir , you are caught . You have done wrong . You did not follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Menshikov , fill me the Goblet of the Golden Eagle . HANNIBAL He did n't know , your majesty . CZAR PETER THE GREAT That is no excuse . This man is suppose to be a poet , yet he does n't know a thing about polite society , such as ours . He did not make the three bows in the proper fashion when he took it upon himself to invite Natalya to dance , when in the minute this right belongs not to the gentleman , but to the lady . Or to whomever I may choose . The Goblet Menshikov . MENSHIKOV gives PETER a huge goblet filled with vodka . . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Now , I want to hear one of these poems you make up on the spot , and you must wash it down with this goblet of vodka . I am sure it will inspire you . Think of the end of your improvisation as down in the bottom of this goblet . And you may rhyme if you wish . Come on monsieur , drunk up . Let us hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How came you to my hand I thought I had enough of you I merely came to dance ( Gulp ) Your first taste was bitter Bitter to the end And as you trickle down my throat I hope you 'll be my friend . ( Gulp ) Your second taste no better No better than the first And my stomach is beginning to tell me It 's going to get a good deal worse ( Gulp ) Oh , to the bottom of this glass I ca n't wait to go . This liquid once was made to pass From one damn dangerous potato . ( Gulp ) What is the number , three or four Or have I already gone past Oh hell , who cares about the count Let 's have another slash . ( Gulp ) Somehow this one 's different I must be near the bottom of the cup And all of you are looking strange You can barely all stand up ( Gulp ) I wonder what I 'm thinking I have the urge to bark I 'm getting drunk from drinking And everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lights up : The sitting room of the Gavril 's home . The adjoining room is Natayla 's bedroom . LIZA is sitting with NATALYA. p. 62 RZHEVSKY Has it been two weeks since Prince Menshikov 's party ? My how the time passes . You and Natalya looked very handsome together . HANNIBAL Yes , Natalya dances very well . She learns quickly . RZHEVSKY Yes , and I 'm afraid the fault is mine . I tell you , Lieutenant-Captain Petrovich , young people are spoiled beyond words nowadays . Young girls play the fool , and we encourage them . I ca n't seem to oppose these whims to learn foreign dances and wear these absurd German fashions , which seem to be worn for nothing more than for good people to laugh at . RZHEVSKY People ca n't help but laugh , and feel sorry for these silly young girls today . With their hair done up as if they wanted castles on their heads . Their stomachs so laced in , it 's a wonder that they do n't break in two . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them forever . Veritable martyrs , the poor dears , they can neither sit , nor stand , nor draw breath in those dresses . RZHEVSKY We Russian gentlemen have long since had our beards shaved and been forced to put on skimpy French jackets ; it 's no use in complaining about woman 's frippery . RZHEVSKY That 's not what you say when Natalya orders new gowns every month , and throws away the one she 's scarcely worn . In the old days a granddaughter used to inherit her grandmother 's sarafan . Now , a young mistress wears a gown one day , and her maid wears it the next . p. 63 RZHEVSKY Yes , it is a pity that the sarafan , and the hair ribbons , and the women 's head dress are all gone now . RZHEVSKY You must realize , Lieutenant-Captain Petrovich , it is difficult nowadays for husbands to keep their wives in hand . Wives have forgotten the words of St. Paul , " Woman revere your husbands " But no , they think of nothing but fine clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm in young ladies attending the assemblies , madame ? With whom would the gentlemen dance ? RZHEVSKY What is the harm ? Why , it is unseemly , sir , for a Russian noblewoman to be in the same room with tobacco smoking Germans and their rude servants . To dance and talk until all hours of the night with young men ? And not with their relatives mind you , but complete and perfect strangers . Why , it 's dreadful . It 's the ruination of our Russian nobility . RZHEVSKY I do n't care for the assemblies either . You may at any moment run upon someone who is drunk , or may be made drunk yourself , just for other people 's amusement . Would n't you say that was true , Korsakov ? KORSAKOV Touche , sir . You have hit the mark . RZHEVSKY I certainly hope it was not too hard on you , Korsakov . You were very drunk , I 'm sorry to say but , you were at fault . I do n't approve of the minuet , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to deal with these silly transgressions of decorum quite severely . You were new to us and he wanted to make an example of you , by making you drink that big goblet of vodka , while reciting your poem . p. 64 HANNIBAL Forgive me , Gavril Afayasyvitch , this is all very interesting , but may I know exactly what it is , that has made Natalya ill ? RZHEVSKY A mystery . A complete mystery , brother Petrovich . The doctor said it was nerves , all the excitement and the sudden news . But , day by day she is getting on much better . RZHEVSKY It 's those tight laced gowns . She ca n't breathe , the poor girl . HANNIBAL But how long before I can speak with her ? RZHEVSKY Natalya is still very ill . She 's a delicate girl ; it takes long for her to recover . She was always ailing and infirm as a child . Ever since she lost her mother , the poor thing . We are forever praying for her good health . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a weak and sickly young girl . HANNIBAL I have been patient , Tatyana Afanasyevna , for almost two weeks . If she 's been ill all this time , perhaps it 's something serious . Maybe we should summon the Czar 's physician . Do n't you think that would be wise Gavril Afansyevitch ? RZHEVSKY No , no , brother Petrovich , not at all . Natalya is getting well . Do n't worry , we 'll prepare her and you shall see her this day . Go in , sister and see to Natalya . Make her ready to receive her fiance . p. 65 RZHEVSKY But Gavril , he ca n't go in her bedroom and see her in her night clothes . We 'll have to dress her . And you might as well know this takes considerable time with young girls nowadays RZHEVSKY Go on , sister . Make Natalya ready . RZHEVSKY But , brother . . . RZHEVSKY Please Tatyana , do as I say . RZHEVSKY Very well . TATYANA enters Natalya 's bedroom . RZHEVSKY You must please forgive my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , my sister 's only niece . She only wants everything to be perfect . . . . If I may , Ibrahim Petrovich , could I have a word with you in private , if the good gentlemen here would n't mind ? HANNIBAL Would you excuse us for a moment , brother ? KORSAKOV As you wish , Ibrahim . I 'll just go and have a pipe in the hall . RZHEVSKY Thank you , sir . KORSAKOV exits . RZHEVSKY I almost hesitate to tell you this , Ibrahim Petrovich . And on my honor as a gentleman , what I 'm about to tell you is something I in no way approve . But while Natalya was sick , in her sleep , in her delirium , she called out the name - Valeryan. p. 66 HANNIBAL Valeryan ? RZHEVSKY Yes . He was an orphan who was brought up in this house . His father was in the guards . He was one of the Czar 's foreign mercenaries . A German . He saved my life during the Streltsi rebellion . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that damned German wolf cub , his son . He and that Swede , Gustav , nearly blew up this place , firing off a toy cannon in this very room . For two years now , he 's been off to the army . Natalya burst into tears saying goodbye to him . Sister love I thought . He , of course just stood there like a stone . It struck me suspicious at the time . Up to now she has n't mentioned him . I thought she had forgotten all about him . But it seems she has n't . But do n't worry , it 's all settled . I assure you , Natalya is pure , and she will marry you . HANNIBAL Is she in love with this boy ? RZHEVSKY Love ? What do young girls know of love ? He 's more like a wayward brother , than anything . HANNIBAL Then why are you telling me this ? RZHEVSKY Because you should know . Chastity and modesty in a young girl are essential . To deceive you , would do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing we have in common , Lieutentant-Captain Petrovich , is our honor . TATYANA appears from Natalya 's bedroom door . p. 67 HANNIBAL Thank you , Gavril Afanasyevitch. . . but it seems you are wanted . RZHEVSKY Oh yes , it 's my sister , my sister Tatyana . Excuse me . Excuse me , brother Petrovich . Forgive me please . I will be right back . Right back . GAVRIL exits with TATYANA into Natalya 's bedroom . Enter KORSAKOV . KORSAKOV Where is he ? HANNIBAL In there with the sister . KORSAKOV I marvel , brother , at your patience . We 've been listening for over an hour to that driveling , stuffy nonsense about the antiquity of the great Lykov and Rzhevsky families . How painful it is for a woman to put on a dress , and that dancing with Germans will give you the plague . Were I in your place , for that old humbug and all of his family , including Natalya Gavrilovna with all of her delicate airs pretending to be sick , I would pick my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at this place . Is this a sitting room for a young girl , or a prison of mirrored vanity ? Surely you 're not in love with this little party dress ? HANNIBAL I 'm not marrying for love . This is for more practical reasons . If she has no positive aversion to me , I 'm going to marry her . KORSAKOV Ibrahim , follow my advice for once . Give up this mad idea . Do n't do it . Do n't marry Natalya. p. 68 HANNIBAL And why not ? What am I supposed to do ? Why should I always live alone , knowing nothing of the joys and duties of fatherhood and family , simply because I was born in another place ? KORSAKOV But it seems to me , that for all this , she has no particular liking for you at all . HANNIBAL A childish objection , Korsakov . I 've given up those charming delusions of love . In this world , it 's enough if she 's innocent and honest . I 've had enough duels at dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow my own set of horns . So I 'll be content so long as she 's true . And perhaps over time , with tenderness , trust , indulgence , she 'll learn to love me . KORSAKOV Listen to yourself . You sound like an old cuckolded husband already . You have n't even married her yet , and already you 're concerned about the girl 's loyalty , and fidelity . Why do it ? You 're the godson of the Czar . Go to him . Talk yourself out of this mess . HANNIBAL I do not wish to go to the Czar for my every whimpering need . But , you do n't understand that , do you ? How could you ? You already come from a noble family . Marrying Rzhevsky 's daughter allies me to Russian nobility , to the land . I 'd have a future . I wo n't be alien in my homeland anymore . The marriage gives me a place with honor . p. 69 KORSAKOV But you , Ibrahim , you with your brooding , suspicious disposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips and fuzzy hair , to expose yourself to the dangers of matrimony in this society of provincialists . It was that way for you , even in Paris . Have you forgotten Countess Leonora already ? Do n't be a fool Ibrahim . What makes you think you can ever have that kind of honor ? IBRAHIM strikes KORSAKOV . HANNIBAL Thank you for your good and friendly advice brother , but you will remember the old proverb , " You need not trouble yourself to nurse other people 's children " KORSAKOV You must be careful , Ibrahim , that you do n't learn the truth of that proverb for yourself . HANNIBAL I already know it . Voices are heard from Natalya 's bedroom . RZHEVSKY He has been coming here to the house for two weeks , and he has n't seen her yet ! He may end up thinking that her illness is a sham , and that we are simply faking , trying to delay and get rid of him ! RZHEVSKY Well , it 's true ; is n't it ? RZHEVSKY The Czar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health ! I told you before I do n't intend to quarrel with the Czar ! Get her ready ! I 'm going out to tell him , he can come in ! You have her ready ! GAVRIL enters the sitting room . p. 70 RZHEVSKY Thank heaven the worst is over . My daughter Natalya , she is much better now . Thank goodness . I 'll take you to your betrothed immediately . She will be so glad to see you . Natalya has been waiting for this moment with all her heart . HANNIBAL Would you please ask your sister to come out . I want to speak with Natalya alone . RZHEVSKY Alone ? This is just not done , sir . We are not Germans here . HANNIBAL You are my future father in law , Gavril Afanasyevitch . I must respect you . But , if honor is the one thing we share between us , then we both must uphold it . RZHEVSKY Very well . Tatyana ! Come ! Let Ibrahim Petrovich go in and see his betrothed . TATYANA enters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Natalya alone , are you ? RZHEVSKY Tatyana , be quiet . IBRAHIM enters Natalya 's bedroom . KORSAKOV Tell us a story , Gavril Afanasyevitch , about your exploits during the Streltsi rebellion . My generation knows so little about the days when Russia was struggling to give us all life . RZHEVSKY Well , if you think so , sir . p. 71 KORSAKOV I do , Gavril Afanasyevitch , I do . Tell us a story . That 's what we 'll do to past the time . Lights focus on Natalya 's bedroom . HANNIBAL I am sorry that you are so ill , Natalya Gavrilovna . RZHEVSKY Thank you , Ibrahim Petrovich . I am much better now . HANNIBAL Good . Good . I was worried . I 've been coming every day for the last two weeks to see you , but you were still very ill . RZHEVSKY That 's very kind of you , Ibrahim Petrovich . HANNIBAL Not at all , I was concerned . After all , when you first got sick , it was at Mon Plaisir when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been coming down with something . HANNIBAL Yes , you must have . . . Yet , people say that you became ill when you heard that our marriage had been arranged . RZHEVSKY I am not ill because of you . HANNIBAL Listen , Natalya , it is the Czar who says this marriage is arranged . And since he commanded it , I 've come here every night for a fortnight to see you . And every night I think of it , marriage . It seems like such a long time , such a long way , all of our lives . And we hardly know each other . . . . . You must look at me , Natalya Gavrilovna , I could be filling your eyes for a long time . Do you want this marriage ? p. 72 RZHEVSKY Yes . HANNIBAL My appearance is not disagreeable to you ? RZHEVSKY No . HANNIBAL Look at me ! RZHEVSKY No . . . . . your appearance is not disagreeable to me . HANNIBAL If it were not the Czar 's wish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czar 's wish . HANNIBAL What if it were not the Czar 's wish ? RZHEVSKY But it is . HANNIBAL Since it is the Czar 's wish , then is my appearance disagreeable to you ? RZHEVSKY What the Czar wishes has no influence on your appearance . I only want to know when you wish to marry me . HANNIBAL And I want to know , if you wish to marry me , Natalya Gavrilovna . RZHEVSKY Why are you doing this ? It is the Czar 's wish , and as everybody else , I wish to please the Czar . What do you want from me ? If you do n't want to marry me , then why are you here ? I 'm only a country girl . I 've never even been to Moscow . I ca n't even read or write . That is the way it is with us young girls in Russia . We have n't any other life than to be women . What do I know ? p. 73 HANNIBAL Why did you come to see me the night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minuet ? RZHEVSKY It was Liza 's idea mostly . It would have been a horrible shame not to have been able to do the minuet where the Czar was in attendance . Why , the Czar commanded it . Commanded me . Liza said that you could teach me . I told her I would do anything not to be humiliated . HANNIBAL And what about that night we first met ? RZHEVSKY I came because you had just come from Paris . And yes it 's true I wanted to see you because I was curious . I wanted to meet the Negro of the Czar . HANNIBAL And did I meet your expectations ? RZHEVSKY Yes . You are dark and have wooly hair . HANNIBAL Wooly ? Come , feel it , Natalya Gavrilovna . Take it in your hands . It 's not woolly , it 's hair . And did this darkness and this wooliness scare you ? RZHEVSKY No . It scared me that you had been to Paris , and knew what women wore underneath their dresses . HANNIBAL You were easily shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me straight Natalya Gavrilovna . Tell me the truth . Do you love another ? If the Czar 's wish could be the same as Natalya Gavrilovna 's wish , what would the Czar 's wish be ? p. 74 RZHEVSKY Lieutenant-Captain Petrovich , can I count on you ? HANNIBAL You have my word of honor . RZHEVSKY I do love someone , but it 's no use . It 's hopeless . Hopeless to think I could marry the boy I love . Father would never allow it . And do you know why ? Because the boy I love , is a German . Enter VALERYAN . VALERYAN So , at last I meet the creature in the flesh . You are the very monkey I came to see . HANNIBAL Who are you ? VALERYAN I am the man who is for you , little tree ape . ENTER GAVRIL , KORSAKOV , &amp; TATYANA RZHEVSKY Get out ! Get out of my house ! Valeryan , get out ! HANNIBAL Valeryan ? KORSAKOV Come , Ibrahim . Let us leave this place . VALERYAN How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero of the Streltsi rebellion , sire your daughter with a gorilla who will give you grandchildren with tails ? KORSAKOV Come , Ibrahim , let 's go . RZHEVSKY Do something , Gavril Afanasyevitch . Our lives are being ruined before our very eyes . p. 75 RZHEVSKY Quiet sister . Take care of the child . VALERYAN Are you a man , sir ? KORSAKOV Why do n't you just settle down , young man ? VALERYAN Is this fop the owner of your tongue ? HANNIBAL No , he is my second . He hands me my pistol every time some bastard bores me . KORSAKOV No , do n't do it , Ibrahim . VALERYAN Your second ? Yes , I accept . HANNIBAL No , it is I who accepts . I am the one who is insulted here , and being the injured party , the ground and the rules belong to me . Who will be your second ? VALERYAN Gustav . Gustav Adamych . ADAMYCH No , young master , please . VALERYAN Gustav Adamych will be my second . Weapons ? HANNIBAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let this pass . Ignore him . I will take care of this . VALERYAN Place ? HANNIBAL In the woods , the clearing in the grove of apple trees near Mon Plaisir. p. 76 RZHEVSKY Please Ibrahim Petrovich , do n't shoot my Valeryan . I 'll marry you , whatever you want . VALERYAN Time ? HANNIBAL Dawn . IBRAHIM exits . KORSAKOV I advise you to make your peace with this world tonight , for you are most assuredly a dead man , young sir . I wish you would save us all the trouble and apologize . KORSAKOV exits . RZHEVSKY Valeryan , you fool . VALERYAN Stepfather , Natalya and I are in love . RZHEVSKY Valeryan ! VALERYAN Natalya . NATALYA and VALERYAN embrace . RZHEVSKY Lord , help us and save us . RZHEVSKY We 're ruined . Ruined . Ruined . Blackout . Lights up . p. 77 Act 2 , Scene 2 A dueling ground in the Russian woods . Lights up on KORSAKOV . Enter IBRAHIM eating an apple . HANNIBAL Is he here yet ? KORSAKOV No . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wo n't come . HANNIBAL He 'll come . He 's young . He 's in love . They always come . Apple Korsakov ? KORSAKOV No thank you , Ibrahim . I have no stomach for apples this morning . HANNIBAL How is it , your second time , Korsakov ? KORSAKOV No better than the first , I 'm afraid . I could n't sleep . The waiting was driving me insane . Yet I wished that the dawn would never come . I kept thinking to myself that this may be the last day that I will ever see my friend . HANNIBAL The world is a dangerous place , Korsakov . It could be true for any day . KORSAKOV Is your honor so important to you ? HANNIBAL It 's not that honor is so important , Korsakov , it 's simply all I have . KORSAKOV There is something I must tell you , Ibrahim . HANNIBAL What is it , Korsakov ? p. 78 KORSAKOV During the night I went for a walk to try and settle my nerves . But since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else for me to go but to come here . Tonight in this wood , I realized that I have not been a good friend to you brother . After Valeryan called you all those awful names , " apes and monkeys , " it struck me that for a brief moment , just before that , I treated you practically the same way . And this may sound utterly naive and simple minded to you , but it has occurred to me that you must endure this sort of thing all the time . I did n't know , Ibrahim . I did n't realize . I would have been more careful , but in truth I do n't want to be careful , with you . I want to be carefree with you . You are my friend . But I know now that I have betrayed you with careless advice , and then stood by and did nothing while you were dishonored . Ibrahim , I know I have insulted you , and you may demand satisfaction from me at your pleasure . HANNIBAL You know , Korsakov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and something within me , are always at odds . I can not tell when it is I who is restraining myself , from when I am being restrained by the world . Who put me in these chains ? Bound me to this skin ? This flesh ? Was it me , or some others ? Is it inside or is it out ? I swear , I honestly can not tell you . But there are times when I have moments truly noble . Where you grapple with your fears so severely , until you suddenly realize that these may be the last moments of your life . Then that life becomes fuller , more alive . More real . My title now is Lord of the duel . My estate spans for twenty paces over this ground . My future lies in the speed of a musket ball , and the fact that I happen to be a very good shot . What does it matter ? There is only oblivion before me now . And if I 'm as good a man to receive it , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I have no quarrel with you brother , because you are my friend . p. 79 KORSAKOV If I am your brother , if I am your friend , then come . Let us just walk away from here now . Here , the penalty for dueling is death . HANNIBAL Death is the penalty in any case . I have nowhere else to go . Between he and I , one of us will leave this ground , and one of us will not . Nothing will live until then . Enter VALERYAN and GUSTAV . VALERYAN I beg your pardon . We seem to be a little late . I am at fault . HANNIBAL You should n't trouble yourself . It will never happen again . ADAMYCH Good morning , sir . And how are you this very early morning ? KORSAKOV Passable , old gray beard , passable . I 'm afraid that I have only had one other experience at this sort of thing . You were a soldier . You must be familiar with the affairs of honor . I would appreciate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Because Lieutenant-Captain Petrovich is the offended party , we must surrender to him the higher ground with his back toward the sun . I 'm sorry young master . VALERYAN It 's all right , Gustav . We must be fair . ADAMYCH Give me your back , sir . Ready ? p. 80 KORSAKOV Ready . ADAMYCH One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten . Ten paces . This marks spot sir . This is where the gentlemen will discharge their weapons . Do you wish for me to make the call ? KORSAKOV No . I 'll do it . Gentlemen , if you please , the rules . " Terms of the duel between Lieutenant-Captain Petrovich of the Preobrazhesky Regiment and Lieutenant Valeryan of the Horse Guards Regiment : The rules . They are simple . You will go to your places and stand your ground . On the first command , you will cock and ready your weapons . On the second command you will aim your weapons . On the given signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired their weapons , and there is no result , we will begin again and again , and again , until the affair of the duel has been satisfied . Gentlemen , take your ground please . IBRAHIM and VALERYAN take their ground . KORSAKOV What do I do now , Gustav ? ADAMYCH Just give a signal , sir . Something they can see , a wave of your hand , a drop of a hat . KORSAKOV takes a handkerchief from his pocket . KORSAKOV When I drop this handkerchief , gentlemen , you may fire . Ready . Aim . Enter IVAN . p. 81 IVAN Hold your arms , by order of the Czar . HANNIBAL So , it 's you Ivan . IVAN They are here , your majesty ! Enter PETER with pistol in hand . CZAR PETER THE GREAT And what do you think you are doing , Ibrahim ? HANNIBAL I am learning your lessons about politics , sire . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Politics ? HANNIBAL Yes , sire . Politics . That great war within this little peace we are having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Czar . Otherwise why are you here ? CZAR PETER THE GREAT Is this how you are loyal to me ? How you keep your word ? How you betray me ? HANNIBAL No one is more betrayed here than me , my sovereign . I did not heed your good advice , and was not a careful soldier . I have been unworthy of you . And I am here to correct that fault or pay the price . CZAR PETER THE GREAT There is n't any such price to pay . I told you before , there 's no dueling in Russia . The penalty for the survivor is death . HANNIBAL Then you shall have to do your duty , sire . p. 82 CZAR PETER THE GREAT I did not mean for this to be my lesson to you , Ibrahim . HANNIBAL Then perhaps , godfather , this will be my lesson to you . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Very well then , do n't let me interrupt you gentlemen . Please , continue on . Korsakov . KORSAKOV Yes , sire . CZAR PETER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't wear . And I have greater means than you . That 's extravagance . You must be careful I do n't quarrel with you . KORSAKOV Yes , sire . Gentlemen , when I drop this handkerchief and it touches the ground , you may consider it the command to fire your weapons . Ready ! Aim ! KORSAKOV drops his handkerchief . Frozen in fear , VALERYAN aims . IBRAHIM awaits his fire in the height of contempt . VALERYAN shoots and misses HANNIBAL ( Raising his pistol ) Wait ! Stop ! Hold where you are ! Stand your ground sir . It 's my turn to fire . I still have the last shot . VALERYAN prepares himself . He turns his body sideways and folds his arms across his chest , making himself the smallest possible target . IBRAHIM fires , and VALERYAN falls . The CZAR aims his pistol at IBRAHIM . p. 83 CZAR PETER THE GREAT It is I who has the last shot , brother . Look at what you 've done , Ibrahim ? You have just killed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godson of the Czar . A Czar is not just a man . He is the state . And as the state he must keep all of his parts . But if he must lose any part of himself , then he must be the one who cuts it off . When you are wrong , I must punish you . You know this . You could n't have won , so why did you do it ? Why ? HANNIBAL Life is hard being your ward , my Czar . All you want to give me , and all I want you to give me , we can not have . I must have that for myself . I have my own laws . CZAR PETER THE GREAT You are speaking in the heat of the moment , Ibrahim . HANNIBAL A moment is all I have . And the good future you mean for me is bleak and bitter . Your good future , and your good intentions will ruin me . I can not give you what you want . I want to , but I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ungrateful ? If you do not give me good reason Ibrahim , I will shoot you where you stand . HANNIBAL Have no fear , godfather . I will stand my ground . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Stand your ground ? The ground on which you are standing is mine . p. 84 HANNIBAL No , godfather . This ground is mine . CZAR PETER THE GREAT You are talking treason , Ibrahim . You , who I raised as a little boy , you are speaking treason to me ? HANNIBAL It is no treason , godfather , but I am not your little boy anymore . CZAR PETER THE GREAT Is that so ? Well , as you say , then I shall have to do my duty . ( Aiming his pistol at Ibrahim ) And now , what is this lesson you were going to teach me , hey ? HANNIBAL ( Leaning into the pistol barrel ) How to live . Blackout .                        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
