The Sailor A Story by Walter Macken Drawings by Orel Zell Tucker liked Jingo . The examiners been only too happy to pass Jingo . Everyone was for him . Everyone said if only he could get his exams he would make a great doctor . When the news spread that Jingo had got his second , everyone nearly broke out flags . Great news , everyone said ; now if he can do the next four years in eight , it will be all right . He was everybody 's friend . Except mine . I hated Jingo at this moment as we walked home in the cold dawn . Jingo was humming . All the singing was in my head . I wanted to be sick . Jingo 's freckles stood out on his pale face . His eyes were as clear as if he had had twelve hours ' sleep . He shoved out his chest . He banged it . " It 's a great morning , " Jingo said . " Does n't it make you feel good to be alive on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lungs . He did n't even cough . " The curse of the God of drunkards on you , Jingo , " I said . " What 's wrong , Mac ? " he asked , clapping me vigorously on the back . " Pain in the craw , boy ? What you want is a cure . " " Please , Jingo , " I said , " do n't strike me . Do n't talk about cures . I want to go home and be sick and go to bed . " " Bags , " said Jingo . " Have to have a cure . " " Where do we get a cure , " I asked , " at five-thirty in the morning ? Are n't we after being forcibly ejected from three pubs since midnight ? I just want to go home , Jingo . I 'm sorry I ever met you . I 'm sorry you ever got your second Med . I hope you never get another exam or if you do that I am in China when you get it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jingo . " Never mind . We 'll rattle up the Sailor . The Sailor is a good sport . The Sailor 'll give us a cure . " He turned away from the promenade beside the sea where we walked in toward the cluster of the town . The dawn was looking at us from over the sea with a cold steely eye . Every time I put my feet on the pavement somebody hit me on the head with a mallet . Into the town we went and over the way and down by a row of shops facing the river . He stopped at a door there . He raised a knocker and banged loudly . " S-sh , for God 's sake ! " I said . The knocker reverberated again . " The Sailor wo n't mind , " said Jingo . " The Sailor is a good sport . " I wondered why Jingo had lived so long . That was his way . The direct approach . You either murdered him or gave in to him . A window shot up . A large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed . A red face with a heavy gray mustache . Two red eyes glaring down at us . " Ah , Sailor , me oul pal , " said Jingo up to him . " Let us in for the love of God and give us a cure . We 're corpsed . " " Where the hell do ye think this is ? " the Sailor asked in a rich booming voice . " D'ye think this is Lourdes ? " " Ha , ha , ha , " said Jingo , heartily . " ' At 's a boy . " The eyes looked at me . " That thing looks dying anyhow , " said the Sailor . " All right , Jingo , I 'll let ye in when I get into me drawers . " The window banged down . T 44 HERE you are , " said Jingo . " Did n't I tell you ? " I was too far gone to rejoin . I leaned against the wall . Jingo had to shake me out of a sleep to get me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these nice unfashionable ones where you sat on a barrel or stood on your legs and felt at home . The Sailor was a vast man . The ceiling was n't low but he was n't very far away from it . His bulk was huge , emphasized by the stripes in his shirt shoved into his pants . " A nice bloody hour of the mornin ' , " he was grumbling as he pulled the corks , " to get a fella out of his bed . Somebody 'll slaughter you someday , Jingo . " " More power to them , " said Jingo . " Did you hear I got me exam , Sailor ? " " I did , " said the Sailor . " A bloody miracle , I said , when I heard it . You must have somebody prayin ' for you . " " It 's brain , " said Jingo , " pure brain . Here 's to all the sailors that go down on the vasty deep . " He swallowed his beer . A small boy with fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a bucket of hot ashes . It was heavy for him . " Will I throw them into the river for you now , Grandfather ? " he asked . " No , no , Paddo , " said the Sailor lifting the flap and coming out . " I 'll do that meself . You 'd be frizzled . " " Hello , Paddo , " said Jingo . " Hello , Jingo , " said Paddo . " What ye doin ' in at this hour ? " " We came to see the doctor , " said Jingo . " He 's the medicine man . Giving us medicine he is . " " That 's not medicine , " said Paddo . " That 's beer . " " Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings , " said Jingo . " Do n't mind him , Paddo , " said the Sailor going out with the bucket . I watched him cross the road and empty it over the low wall into the river . The light ashes rose in a cloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , moving ponderously . Jingo had Paddo up on the counter . He was a nice little boy , about five years old . Jingo was drawing faces for him in the spilled beer on the counter . Jingo had a way with kids too . The Sailor came back and closed the door . " That fella , " he said to me , " will get his last exam the day I put ass or tip in the Atlantic Ocean . " He went in behind the counter . This remark interested me . " Do you like the sea ? " I asked . He looked closely at me . Then he relaxed and came over . " Why do you think they call me the Sailor ? " he asked . " Presumably , " I said , " because you were . " " No , " he said . " That 's what they are like around here . They always name you the opposite of what you are . I never put a foot in the sea in me life and I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's easy , " he said . " I was born way out beyant where they live by boats . I saw me father come back one time on two planks and a belly of sea water in him . I had one brother that never came back at all , and an uncle . " He paused then . I could see that picture clearly . " I said I would never let the sea get me . So I came into this town . I worked in a shop . Then I started this place of me own . Where could you get farther from the sea than here ? " " I see what you mean , " I said . He rubbed the counter with a cloth . " I have three sons , " he said then . " One of ' them is Paddo 's father , the eldest one . What do you think they went and did ? " " They went to sea , " I said . " That 's right , " he said . " They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other two fish the bay out there in their boats . So you see , I warned them . I told them . But they would n't listen . They are safe so far . But it wo n't get me . You understand that . You get my point , mister . " " I do , " I said . I did . He is a nice man , the Sailor . Why does or how does Jingo get to know only the real nice people ? I felt I had known the Sailor for years . The Sailor was Biblical . In a few sentences he told you the story of his life and it was all there in a clear honest face . " So Tong , Paddo , " Jingo was saying . " If I had a bob I 'd give it to you but I have no money and my friend there has to pay for the medicine and he has no money left . " " Yes I have , " I said . " I have ninepence . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats with it . Right ? " I inquired of the Sailor . " Right , mister , " said the Sailor . He smiled a big smile at me . I felt that we were friends . I felt I had really had a cure . We went home to bed . I WAS going out of the hospital getting into my coat . I had a date . I was late for my date . She was redheaded and punctual . " Doctor , " said the Sister stopping me . " An emergency . Down near the boats . They are putting oxygen into the ambulance . " I said a bad word . " Tut , tut , " she said . " Only six months qualified and he talks like a doctor already . " I ran for the ambulance . I was fuming . I was thinking about the temper of my redhead and how she could scorch you with silence or speech . * ? We went through the town fast . We went down to the fishing boat quays . I was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They looked around as the ambulance stopped . bending ground . very sad . " It 's Paddo , " he said . " Poor oul Paddo . " The fair hair was clinging to the narrow face . All the water was out of him . He was wearing a red jersey that was dark in color from the water . Short pants and his legs and feet bare and brown . " We 'll try the oxygen on him , " I said . " It 's no use , " said Jingo , bending and taking the light body up into his arms . " I was coming home from college . I 've been at him ever since . They were playing in the boats . He fell over . They did n't miss him until it was too late . " The tide was in . It was a high tide . It was bearing the black boats high . It was calm sea and clear , the top of it littered with things it picked up as it came in . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jingo moving toward the ambulance . He stopped there as the Sailor came 36 through the crowd . He looked into Jingo 's eyes . Jingo was too late hiding the look in them . The Sailor came over . He looked down into the hanging face of the dead boy . He put out an enormous hand and laid it gently on the smooth skin of the boy 's face . " Oh , Paddo , Paddo , " said the Sailor , and great gobs of tears poured out of his eyes like rainwater on a pane of glass . " Get him in , Jingo , " I said becoming official . Jingo brought him in and placed him on the stretcher . " You can come , " I said to the Sailor . That broke a lot of rules . We went away . Jingo and he sat on the other side as I put the oxygen mask on the boy 's face . I heard the Sailor sobbing . " Shush ! Shush ! " said Jingo . He quieted down . I pumped oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . He was too dead . " Ye do n't know why I cry , " said the Sailor . " I do n't cry for the reason ye think . I cry because I am a selfish man . I love my Paddo , better than my own sons , and here I look at him now and ye know the thought that comes to me . It is a terrible thought . Always I have been afraid of the sea . Someday , I say , the sea will get you . I say it will never get me , but deep inside here I am afraid of this . The jinx is on me . And now the sea gets Paddo and I think , well that 's what it is . The sea takes Paddo and it will not take you . Christ forgive me for a sinful man . " " Shush man , you 're wild , you 're wild , " said Jingo . " I think I must tell his mother . I must tell his father . I see their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of me empty life without that fair laughing boy in it , and at the end of my thinking there is the other thought . You have paid off the sea with Paddo . " " For God 's sake , Sailor ! " Jingo shouted . The oxygen ruffled the fair drying hair of the boy . I T WAS six o'clock in the morning . It was a cold bitter morning . I could n't look the morning in the face unless I half closed my eyes . We were walking home , Jingo and I. Jingo was as sober as a judge . ( Has this wise saw ever been physically tested ? ) The reason Jingo was as sober as a judge was that he was drinking orange crushes . " Here , Mac , " said Jingo , " gim me your hand . " I did n't , he took it . He rubbed the palm of my hand against his coat . " You have now the honor , " he said , " to be rubbing Doctor Jingo . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do you remember , Mac , the time I got my second Med , we walked along this promemade , you and I , after celebrating ? " " How can I remember that far back ? " I asked . " That must be eight years ago . All I remember about that morning is hoping that I 'd be in China if ever the day came that you got your final . " The odd part of this was that I was in China . I had been a doctor on a boat for two years . 1 was in China until two months ago . I come home to the home town for a brief holiday , and what happens ? I walk into Jingo 's final . " What you want is a cure , " said Jingo , " and I know the very man who will give us a cure . " " The Sailor , " I said . " The very man , " said Jingo . " How is the Sailor ? " I asked . " The Sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jingo . " I say the Sailor , and you remember a huge man who would shake floorboards . " " No , " I said , " I remember a big man crying over the body of a boy . " " So you had n't forgotten , " he said . " There arc some things , Jingo , " I said , " that you never forget . " " Well , " he said , " I see the Sailor very often ever since . How many years ago is that ? Say four . Every year that passes the Sailor has become four times smaller . Wait until you see him . " " I think I 'd like to not see him , " I said . " I think I 'd prefer to remember him as he was . " " You know the fixation he had , " said Jingo . " About the sea . About Paddo taking the curse from him . He was always such an honest man . There is n't a sinner in the town now who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several balls of malt . The Sailor has taken to the drink . " " Let 's go home another way , Jingo , " I said . " Let 's not pass by the Sailor 's . " " No , " said Jingo . " I promised him . The day I got the final I was to go to him until he rubbed my coat . " We turned the corner . I was thinking out of the past of the Sailor emptying the ashes in the river and coming back and saying something about Jingo getting his final exams the day he dipped ass or tip in the sea . " There he is , " said Jingo pointing . T HE light was in the sky . Away in the distance we saw the figure of the man leaving his door and going over to the wall with the bucket in his hand . Even from here the change in him shocked me . He was a small man . He did n't walk ponderously with weight , but slowly with bowed age . We walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and the cloud of ashes leaving , and then thebucket did n't come back but went on and the little man 's legs went over the low stone wall and he followed the bucket into the river . Jingo ran . I ran . I had to close my eyes . The pounding of my feet was exploding in my head . It was a very swift river and very deep . It turned left at the bridge and joined the sea . We ran toward the junction . jingo was far ahead of me . I saw him flinging his coat away and leaping over the wall . I shouted , " Jingo , for God 's sake , come back ! " I ran on . My heart was bursting . Inside the bridge there was a round where the wall of the river met the wall of the sea . It was grass covered . I threw myself full length on it . I saw Jingo to my left in the water . He breathed deep and dived . I saw his taut wet trousers as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him , " he said pulling at something . I held out my hand . " Catch , catch , Jingo , " I shouted , " for the love of God ! " I did n't look to the right . Here the sea and the stream of the main river were meeting and clashing . It was a maelstrom there . Every time the sea came in it was like that . A terrible lashing of white foam . If Jingo gets into that he will have been a doctor for a day . His wet hand caught mine as he was being swept past . I held it with my hand . I held it with my two hands . " He 's slipping , slipping , slipping , " Jingo shouted . " Let me go . Let me go , Mac . " I did n't let him go . I held on with my two hands . Out of the corner of my eye I saw a mass of white and black that rose to the surface of the thrashing water and then sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big fish on the end of a weak line . If I let him go he would never come back . He shouted up at me , his teeth bare , gripping . He tried to strike up at my face with his free hand . I held on to him with my eyes closed . After a time he became quiet . He reached his free hand for the top of the quay wall . I rose to my knees . He came free . The water dripped from him . His freckles stood out on his pale face . He walked past me . He ran to the middle of the bridge . He looked where the river had been conquered by the sea . The sea was retreating after its ephemeral victory . It was carrying booty with it . " How right he was , " said Jingo . " How right he was . " He rested his head on his clenched hands .
