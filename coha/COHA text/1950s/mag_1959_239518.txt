Only a year ago , almost every available inch of wall space in Algiers sang the praise of Charles de Gaulle , but last week , on the first anniversary of his being called to power , the city was in a different mood . Though 50,000 people gathered in the forum to hear speeches , they were mostly Moslems , whom the French soldiers can mobilize for shows with quiet efficiency . " Shout ' Algerie Franfaise ! ' " cried an officer from a psychological-warfare unit , but he got only feeble response . Behind him a captain rattled off a steady stream of orders to his men scattered through the audience . " Phantom Two to Phantom : when the speaker shouts ' Algerie , ' you shout ' Franfaise ! ' Shout ! Shout ! Do n't just stand there like sticks of asparagus . " <P> In Constantine , 200 miles to the east , still seething over the killing by F.L.N. terrorists of three French youths and the kidnaping of a young girl ( TIME , May 18 ) , French settlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vent to their anger at De Gaulle by jeering a column of weary soldiers returning from a long search in the hills for the kidnapers . And in Algiers , a mob of 500 students shouting " De Gaulle to the gallows ! " ran afoul of truncheon-swinging police . " Unprovoked police brutality , " snapped bearded Pierre Lagaillarde , who led the storming of the Government General Building a year ago . " There were no seditious remarks . " But what about the cry of " De Gaulle to the gallows ? " a reporter asked . " Its meaning may be seditious , " replied Lagaillarde . " But there are good reasons for putting it into words . " <P> Shut Up or Get Out . For such extremists , the " good reasons " are that one year of De Gaulle has meant the election across Algeria of 15,000 Moslem municipal councilors , the promise of massive economic aid , and a regal contempt for those settlers who want an outdated " Papa 's Algeria , " i.e. , an Algeria run comfortably by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . <P> Of their hero generals of the first May 13 , only Paratrooper Jacques Massu was still on hand , and he last week pointedly renewed his allegiance to De Gaulle . General Raoul Salan now has the innocuous post of commandant of Paris , and 1,500 other officers have been transferred out of Algeria . De Gaulle 's Governor General , Paul Delouvrier , constantly reminds the Ultras that " policy is made in Paris , even for Algiers , " last week bluntly told " those who would divide us " to " shut up or get out . " The Ultras are still strong enough to spoil a birthday , but not to wreck a government . <P> Brothers or Comrades . Some of the settlers now recognize that the Frenchman 's only hope in Algeria is to share it with the Algerians as equals . But the most significant change to have come about during the year is in the army . Purged of its extremists , it is now a thoroughly efficient fighting force that steers carefully clear of politics . It seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algeria ) as almost as great an obstacle to an Algerian solution as the rebels themselves . Last week , after a series of clashes between his soldiers and the local Ultras , the commanding officer in Constantine plastered the town with posters : YOU WILL CALL THE MOSLEMS
