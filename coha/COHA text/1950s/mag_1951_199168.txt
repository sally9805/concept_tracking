At 34 , Dr. Giovanni Pauletta was head of all microbiological research at Carlo Erba , Milan 's big chemical-pharmaceutical company . Recognized as one of Italy 's topflight microbiologists , he was one of the first to study penicillin mold in Italy , had written widely on antibiotics . Dr. Pauletta 's colleagues also knew him as a dedicated and fearless experimenter who had used himself as a guinea pig hundreds of times . But the doctor never talked much about his experiments . " He was a very modest man , " his colleagues said . <P> One morning last week , Dr. Pauletta walked into his office and called his assistant , 28-year-old Dr. Angelo Cresseri . He showed him a bottle of colorless liquid marked " Glutaril cas. 20% . " It was a new formula , said Dr. Pauletta . He filled a large syringe with the liquid and ordered Assistant Cresseri to give him an intramuscular injection in the thigh . <P> No one at Carlo Erba knew exactly what the new formula was . Pauletta had reported only that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guinea pigs with favorable results . <P> Dr. Pauletta 's assistant gave him the injection and turned back to his desk . Ten minutes later he heard violent , racking coughs . Pauletta was grasping his throat as if choking . He blurted out , " Call Dr. Banderali , " and lost consciousness . The doctor gave him artificial respiration , injected two doses of heart stimulant . An ambulance rushed him to a hospital where his chest was opened , his heart massaged . Nothing helped . Within an hour after the injection , Dr. Pauletta was dead . <P> What was glutaril cas. 20% ? At week 's end , the police had not yet succeeded in getting an analysis of what was left in the bottle . Dr. Pauletta 's colleagues guessed that it might be an antibiotic of the chloromycetin group . They were helping police sift through the dead man 's papers , to see if Dr. Pauletta had left any notes about it .
