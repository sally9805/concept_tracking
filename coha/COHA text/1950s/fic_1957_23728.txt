THE CUB Story by CHRISTINE WESTON Drawings by Bernard Perlin ? T HE BIG rains were over and up here in the high Himalayan air things had a freshness reminiscent of spring , except that now in September the pink and purple primulas which grow in these valleys had gone and with them the begonias and dark red cyclamen , and a kind of pale lavender orchid flowered instead , and on the open slopes and meadows great patches of pearly everlasting which have a warm , aromatic scent . A tiger cub , stepping from the shadow of the tree-line on to a spur overlooking a small valley and a stream in spate flowing through it , paused to look around him , and to listen . The sun shone full upon him and lie Look fire in its incandescence , all orange-red and black , his growing ruff white as the papery flowers among which he stood , and dozens of small white moths flew up out of the flowers and did a kind of sun dance around his head . His mother was dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a village several miles from where the cub now found himself , and the villagers had shot her . The blast of the shot followed by their mother 's death throes had frightened her two cubs into headlong flight , and so probably saved their lives . For two days they wandered hungry and with no very clear idea of where they were , then they stumbled on a jungle cock with a broken wing , and as much from an instinct of play as from hunger , stalked the bird , and in a simultaneous rush fell to fighting between themselves , filling the air with miniature roars and flying leaves , but the female , cuffing her brother into subjection , had made off with the prize , her tail in the air , growling like a teakettle . The cub did not sec his sister again . Alone , he ambled through low-growing oak forests and through aisles of pine trees , and the sun falling between the branches striped the ground in light and shadow , so that at moments it would have been difficult to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternating air , detaching himself from the protective backdrop and melting into it again , his round , rosette-like feet soundless on the scented ground . There was plenty of water so he did not suffer from thirst , but he was hungry and had not yet mastered the lesson his mother had been in process of teaching him and his sister when she died  --  the lesson of killing for food , although the instinct was there , reverberating in his belly and in an occasional nervous twitching of his tail . The day after his sister 's triumphant exit with the jungle fowl , the cub found a nest of mice and joyfully slaughtered the lot and ate them . He felt better , but mice were after all hardly more than an appetizer , and now as he stepped from the trees and stood in the sun among the white everlastings he felt hungry and gave vent to a small , querulous whimper , and a shudder ran down his spine like the ripple of a wave , ending in a convulsive twitch of his tail . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a vista of the surrounding hills , THE green in the washed September light , under a chalk-blue sky with a single white cloud in it , like a white rose . In the distance , to his left and across the valley , the cub heard sounds . Human voices and the lowing of a calf , and these he recognized as somehow belonging to his immediate past and directly connected with the events that had sent him and his sister tumbling into the jungle at his mother 's death two days ago . He growled again , but there was no loud noise to frighten him , and obeying sonic freakish impulse he turned and bounded down the hillside toward the valley floor and the stream which he could hear rushing among the stones . It was a different world from the one he 'd just left in the white heat of the open sky . The air was coo ! and dense with shade , the water made a lively noise among the stones , and a family of long-tailed magpies , spying him , set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his way down a small footpath toward the stream , moving with the loose-jointed gait of a young creature , his coat seeming still too big , his head and paws out of all proportion to the rest of him , The magpies chattered furiously and one made a daring swoop over his head , but the cub merely twitched the end of his tail and went on down to the stream , where he crouched and began to drink . The water was green and clear and he could see his reflection quivering under the slight disturbance made by his tongue as he drank . Then he suddenly stopped drinking , but kept his head lowered just above the stream and stared in amazement at something directly under his eyes . There , beneath the smooth tug of the current , on the floor of a semicircular pool formed by surrounding rocks , a small brown bird was calmly walking , bobbing its head , and as at home in that peculiar element with three feet of water roofing it in , as the cub was in his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream . The cub staved motionless , water dripping from his whiskers and falling back into the pool . His eves , round gold grottoes fissured with a darker gold , followed the crazy motions of the water ouzel below him , and the magpies , fascinated by his sudden immobility , arranged themselves in a watchful row along their branch , and fell silent . The water ouzel disappeared in the flurry of a small cascade between some rocks , and the cub , overtaken by a lunatic excitement , growled and went charging up the bank and began to tear round and round in the bracken , chasing his own tail , stopping to pull himself stiff-legged on all four feet , fur on end , cars laid back , spitting fury at some imaginary enemy , while the magpies in an ecstasy of rage fled to the higher branches , there to perch and peer fearfully at this dauphin of the jungle and his incomprehensible antics down there among the ferns . Tiring of his game , the cub clambered up the slope and found a large flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tail to the tree trunk and his head pointing toward the stream and the footpath which ran alongside . Sunlight flickered on his body , painting it into the background so you might have stepped on him in that delicately shifting light and shade , or mistaken his head for some species of giant orchid , intricately designed as it rested motionless on his paws . A dragonfly came to rest on a nearby leaf and for a moment the cub stared at its emerald body and blobby turquoise eyes , then he went to sleep . 1 T IS N'T as if we had much choice , " the man said " He is a good boy and his father owns four buffaloes beside cows and pigs . In addition , they have two acres of land and three fruit trees  --  an apple , an apricot , and a plum . Our daughter could do a lot worse than marry Buddhu 's son . " He took his axe from its hook on the wall , and squatting on the mud floor of the tiny one-room hut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had previously spit . His wife crouched in the doorway , grinding spices for the day 's meal . Her silver bangles clinked as she worked and she kept her headcloth pulled down so it partially covered her face . Her hands were tough and dark from work and exposure , and the skin looked like the bark of a tree . Her bare feet were hard also , cracked and splayed out trOm incessant walking and from carrying heavy loads . She was not strong and no longer young , but she had neither the encouragement nor the leisure to brood about it . Her two older children were married and lived at a place called Haidwani , two days ' journey on foot and by train , and she never saw them and hardly ever heard from them . Now she was thinking about her youngest child , Putali , aged ten and recently betrothed to Buddhu 's thirteenyear-old son , who lived with his parents eight miles away in the village where the cub 's mother had been shot . Putali herself was completely indifferent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which so far she had been told little . Squatting under the medlar tree beside her father 's pumpkin patch , she was at the moment cornplete/y absorbed in trying to extract a leech from the nose of her pet calf , whom she had named Pyaree , which means Love . The leech had taken up its abode in the calf 's left nostril and had so far resisted all Putali 's efforts to pull it out . The calf was no help . Three months old and orphaned a month before when his mother had been carried away in a landslide during the heavy rains , he had become Putali 's sole preoccupation . He was spoiled , flighty , and unpredictable , permitting Putali much in the way of blandishment and abuse , but drawing the line at allowing her to tamper with his nose . Stretched on the grass and tethered between two stakes , the calf watched her delicate pliant hands come at him with a pair of chimtas , or tongs , and immediately began to thrash about , twisting his head out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the sounds , accompanied by Putali 's shrill laughter , that the cub had heard when he stood on the spur overlooking the valley and the stream which ran a little distance below and out of sight of Putali 's home . Putali 's mother glanced up from her grinding and saw the two young creatures under the medlar tree , the calf milk-white , Putali 's scarlet skirt spread around her on the grass where she squatted before the calf , her blue headcloth flung back , revealing the honey skin and dark gray eyes . A pretty child , the mother thought , with a catch in her breath . The prettiest child by far for miles in these lonely bills . And Buddhu 's son was said to have a weak chest and asthma , and even if his parents were well-to-do and seemed agreeable to this match , who was to say what manner of people they really were , or how they would treat this high-spirited bride once she was under their roof ? " I do n't know , " the woman murmured sud-denly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . " I do n't know . " " You do n't need to know , " her husband replied , shortly . " Everything is arranged . I have arranged it , and you should be glad . It is n't every family who can offer so much and who would be willing to take a girl with little for dowry except the clothes she stands in , a couple of brass cookpots , and a bull calf . " The woman was silent . She knew that there was no argument , that everything had been arranged , as he said , and that he and the boy 's father had clone the arranging , and that she should he glad . It was n't every family who could offer as much as Buddhu had offered in exchange for a healthy and vigorous girl with a complexion the color of honey and the only pair of gray eyes , probably , in the entire district . But the woman was not happy . Pulling her headcloth lower over her face she went on grinding spices while her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional angry glance at her , and beyond her at the figure of his daughter and the calf , a concentrated group of blue and scarlet and pure white under the leaning heat of the sun , under a single whitc cloud like a white rose in the chalk-blue sky . The man said presently : " She wo n't have to go yet , anyway . There is plenty of time . " " She will go when she is ready , " the woman answered from behind her veil . " She will go when she is ready , and that may be any time . You know how it is . Any time . " " There is no pleasing you , " the man said bitterly . " What have our other children done for us ? They do n't even write . " " They never learned . " " They could send word , and a little money . They have more than we . Now here is this chance for our youngest to make a good marriage , and you sit there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang up suddenly , his face dark with anger , and carrying the axe made his way out of the but and across the little clearing which was all he owned besides the but and a buffalo and the bull calf , and without speaking to Putali , who looked up as he passed , he disappeared up the hillside to the tree-line to cut wood for the evening 's requirements . Putali , bored by her unsuccessful efforts to extract the leech from her pet 's nose , untethered him and came slowly toward the but as she heard her mother calling to her . The calf trotted after her , as he usually did when she was not trotting after him . The woman watched them approach . They glowed in that strong light , all life and color , and she thought : " It is such a brief time ! " Putali stood on the grass outside the door and her mother said : " Take these cookpots down to the water and wash them . Wash them prop-erly , using sand . How often do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't get the leech out . I can see it inside his nose , but he wo n't even let me try . Bawls , and even tries to butt me . Lucky he has n't got horns , or I 'd be dead . " And she laughed , showing her shining teeth . " When you 've washed the pots thoroughly , rinse them so there is no sand left inside . You remember what happened to our teeth last time ? " " Crunch crunch ! " Putali said , laughing . " Give me the pots and make them shine like Pyaree 's eyes . " S H E took the cookpots , stacking them on her head on one another , and the calf followed her as she made her way down the worn white thread of a path which led from her door to the edge of the stream . Putting the pots on the bank Putali gathered up her skirt and tucked the ends into her waist band and waded a little way into the water , which felt like ice around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water 's edge and watched her as she gave the pots a preliminary rinsing , then poured sand into them and keeled them , standing with her feet inside and using her hard little heels as twisting this way and that , the noisily alongside . When the pots were scoured and rinsed she turned them upside down to drain on the grass , and , duty done , waded farther upstream in search of the lavender orchids which grew there , and for the small mottled snakes which are harmless and quite easy to catch . Coming to the pool where the cub had drunk , she peered into it in hope of seeing the water ouzel , and there he was , walking about unconcernedly on the stones under the smooth flow of the stream , and Putali watched him , amused . She had once tried to catch him , but he 'd vanished , and all she got for her pains was a noseful of icy water which made her sneeze . The call followed her along the path on the edge of the stream to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue on the other side , and in a sudden access of independence he went romping over the bridge to the opposite bank and along the farther path out of sight . " Pyaree ! " Putali shouted , and started across the bridge in pursuit . " Pyaree , come back ! " The cub , waking from his slumber , sprang up , then fell into a half-crouch in the shadows , his eyes catching the slanting rays of the sun as it filtered between the leaves . He saw the calf gamboling along the path below him , and , with the instinct of most young things to follow something else , leaped noiselessly from his hiding place and went in pursuit , his tail , like the high in the air , his round infantine feet soundless on the tightly packed earth . " Py-ar-ee ! " wailed Putali , flying after the calf , her scarlet skirt standing out like a sail behind her . " Pyaree , you devil ! Come back ! " The calf paid no attention . The air was warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing a scent of pearly everlasting and a promise of untouched grass . He kicked his heels as he heard Putali 's voice , now fading , now gaining , coming up the path behind him . Putali rounded the corner and saw the cub in full cry after the calf , and the sight brought her to an abrupt halt . Then picking up a stone she ran after them , not calling now , but furious and concentrated in face of the danger to her pet . The calf came to a small washout where water from the hillside had gullied out the earth on its way to join the stream . Feckless and easily diverted , he whirled and almost bumped head-on into the cub , and for a second the pair stood nose to nose , staring at each other in amazement . Then the cub turned tail and came scampering down the path with the calf after him , and Putali saw them coming and sprang up the slope to let them pass . The cub tore down the path , ears back , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone gripped in her hand , dropped down on to the path again and raced after them , screaming . Her mother , boiling lentils for their evening meal , heard the noise and sighed , thinking : " Let her play . There is not much time . Let her enjoy life while she can still call it her own . " The cub in his turn came to an obstruction in the path where a large boulder jutted out from the hillside , and here he turned , fur on end , the tip of a pink tongue , wet , clean , infantile , showing between his black lips . The calf slowed to a demure walk and again they faced each other , nose to nose , and there Putali came on them , her face crimson front running , the stone clutched in her hand . " Pyaree ! " she screamed , and flung the stone at the cub , missing him . " Pyaree ! " The cub spat , then growled , and Putali , half intimidated and half carried away in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calf after her , the cub after the calf . Putali ran with such speed that she missed the stone bridge and kept going , hearing the calf galloping behind her and the magpies screeching overhead . The meadow opened up white and level and full of a warm scent , and here calf and cub separated , one going right , the other left , leaving Putali standing alone , panting , the white flowers reaching halfway up her scarlet skirts and her blue headcloth trailing down her hack . " Pyaree , " she called softly , seeing him at a little distance , negligently sampling the aromatic leaves . And then she went into that high-pitched , seductive cry of herdsmen in this part of the world , the " La la la ! " echoed and reechoed among the surrounding hills . T HE CUB had disappeared , and at first the calf pretended not to hear his mistress , but her voice was insistent and alluring ; it spelled darkness , home coming , warmth ; it spelled a handful of raw sugar mixed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did n't obey he was apt to get his tail well twisted and feel the impact of Putali 's heel on his rump . Slowly , taking his time , he moved toward her , when the cub , lying in wait among the everlasting , sprang up in front of him , and off they MAGAZINE went , round and round among . the raspberry bushes , bounding through the white expanse of flowers which made a dry rustle like starched muslin against their bodies , under a cloud of little white moths which rose and fell and glittered like mica in the sun . Putali armed herself with more stones and went after the calf , whose turn it now seemed to he to chase the cub , which she could hardly see because , more versatile than his playmate , he had once more hidden himself among the flowers and was waiting , head on paws , for the calf to find him . " La ! " cried Putali . " La la la ! " And " Ah ! " chorused the hills in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping toward her through all that scented whiteness , and when he was within reach Putali sprang forward and seized him round the neck , holding him fast despite his kicking and bawling . " I 'll teach you , " she gasped , and cuffed him soundly . " I 'll teach you ! " She got hold of his tail and took a turn of its silky tassel round her wrist . The calf twisted and strained to get away , but she kept him headed back towards the path , and as they went the cub rose slowly out of his hiding place and gazed inquiringly after them , sneezing once from the dust of the flowers , which had got into his nose . He was rather tired from the game , but hated to have it end , and after a moment 's hesitation he walked out of the meadow on to the path in time to see Putali and the calf as they crossed the bridge of stones and disappeared among the trees on the other side of the stream . Disappointed , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream and drank , then made his way back to the place where he had been resting earlier , and there he lay clown and began to clean the fur on his chest and forearms , his tongue making a slight rasping sound , and the magpies came back and sat on a branch and watched hint intently , their blue tail feathers hanging stiffly downward . On her way hack to the but Putali picked up the cookpots and carried them to the door , then flung herself on the grass and began to laugh . " A cat , " she said . " A cat as big as this ! " she gestured . " A big , big cat ! It chased Pyaree and me and I had to throw stones . . . " She laughed helplessly , with only a faint , remembered disquiet . " I thought it might hurt Pyaree . As big as this , it was ! In the meadow , with the white flowers . " " No doubt , " said her mother . She was used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every DEPARTURE : day . " No doubt . But I am glad to see that you got the pots properly cleaned this time . " She looked at the child whose scarlet skirt spread on the grass like a flower fallen from some celestial tree . " You might as well get the habit of doing what you 're told . You 'll find it easier in the end . " " You should have seen it , Perhaps it was a dog . I 'm not sure . It looked like a cat . A big cat . " " There is food if you are hungry , " the mother told her . " You must be hungry after all that running about and screaming . Come inside and eat . " Putali was hungry . Growing fast , growing more beautiful every day , she could not remember a time when she was not hungry , Picking herself up she went into the hut , and the calf , kicking free of the straw rope with which she had carelessly hitched him , made his way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side , and went vaguely in search of the cub . The magpies saw him and were quiet . They knew the calf and were not in the least interested in his existence . Then the cub heard the neat little footsteps tapping along , and immediately forgot all about his toilet . Moving with infinite stealth , he crept to the edge of the rock and peered over . The calf was walking slow , trailing his broken rope , and the cub waited with MARK VAN DOREN DEPARTURE : SEPTEMBER ears pressed flat against his head , his eyes round and unwinking . All in a line on their branch , the magpies craned a little forward to watch . A shudder ran down the cub 's spine , starting at his shoulders and rippling to the end of his tail , which curled back on itself in a single convulsive spasm , then became still . The calf walked up the path and when he was directly below the rock where the cub was waiting the cub gave a leap and landed on the calf 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the silken white neck . For a moment both lay there in the gently moving shadows while the magpies screamed and fluttered above them , then the cub let go his hold and stood up , and for a moment the calf lay still , his black eyes wide open , staring at nothing . The cub waited , wondering perhaps why the calf did n't want to play , and in a minute or two the calf moved and tried to rise , but the cub sprang on him and struck him with his paw , and the calf lay down and did not move again , a channel of blood the color of Putali 's skirt running from the wound in his throat . The cub growled , then bent his head and sniffed the blood . He stuck out his tongue and tasted it and a great shudder went through him and he growled on a different note , standing over the calf , and suddenly , for the first time , understanding what the game was about . HE HAS driven away , and with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much As I look for this morning ; and see on the lawn  --  Look , leaves fallen , and dry to the touch . More titan warns green , than lazy long growth , Went down the cool hill with him only last night . I am here , he is there : it is each , it is both Things sicken me now with their secret delight ; As if it were good to devour an old heart ; As if it were pleasure to leave in its place A dry , small mind whose meagerest art Will be to remember his hands and his face : How he did this , and how he said that , And how he was angry for part of one day ; As if it were better to sit where he sat Than to have him still here and deciding to stay .
