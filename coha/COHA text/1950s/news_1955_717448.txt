Sixty thousand boys and girls from 10,850 high schools in all the states spent two hours seeking the right answers for 115 brain-teasing questions . The stakes were high  --  but so were the odds . Only 400 scholarships are , to be awarded , making this a 1,500-to-1 conest . But the prizes will average $3,500 for a four-year college education . The awards may even go as high as *8,000 depending upon the needs of the individual student . Each winner may choose his college and will get free tuition , board , room , travel and maintenance . This was all part of the National Merit Scholarship Screening Test , the lamest independent ptogram of its kind in American education . The project was set up recently with a $20,500,000 grant from the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation . Funds // have been added by the Sears , Roebuck and Time-Life Foundations .

The 1,400 next-highest students will get certificates of merit . Their achievements be sent to various colleges , which means that they , too , may end up with awards . Moment of Taking Plunge Promptly . at 9 o'clock yesterday morning , the tests began . Only the upper 5 per cent of the senior class was eligible . In this city , 1,921 seniors from 136 private , public and parochial high schools sat with sharpened , dark-blue electrographic pencils , waiting for the word " go . " Forty-two boys and girls , with high school averages of 93.16 or better , awaited the " get-ready " signal at the Bronx High School of Science . The scene was typical of similar situations over the country . " Let 's go ! " said Dr. Bernard Manson , director of guidance at the school . The three proctors took their stations . The test was designed to measure certain verbal and quantitative abilities related to success in college . It contained enough difficult questions to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The " hard " questions were intended to measure the pupil 's ability to reason quantitatively ? to relate , compare , estimate and symbolize . To wit : " ( 1 ) In a certain factory the ' rate of absenteeism for the sixty male employes is 10 per cent and the rate for the forty-five ' female employes Is 33 1/3 per cent . What is the rate of absenteeism for the factory as a whole ? ( check one ) . In other questions , the students worked on charts and graphs . They were asked to interpret data and to draw inferences . For example , one chart gave the seasonal changes in the population of a bird community . A careful analysis of the graph and line drawings would tell when the birds would be in their sanctuaries .

" In the field of language an Americanism is generally regarded by the English as ipso facto obnoxious , and when-a new one of any pungency begins to force its way into British usage the guardians of the national linguistic chastity belabor it with great vehemence and predict calamitous consequences if it is not put down . If it makes progress despite these alarms , they often switch to the doctrine that it is really old English and search the Oxford Dictionary for examples of its use in Chaucer 's time ; but while it is coming in they give it no quarter . Here the unparalleled English talent for discovering moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproar over a word sometimes ends as a holy war to keep the knavish Yankee from undermining and ruining the English Kulture and overthrowing the British Empire , The cmsade provides abundant sources of humor . Not infrequently a phrase denounced es an abominable Americanism really originated in the London music halls and is unknown in the United States . And almost as often the denunciation of it is sprinklered with genuine Americanisms , unconsciously picked up . " The English seldom differentiate between American slang and Americanisms which are of legitimate origin and in respectable use : both belong to what they often call " the American slanguage . " It is most unusual for an American book to be reJiewed in England without some reference to its strange and ( so one gathers ) generally unpleasant diction . The Literary Supplement of The London Times is especially alert in this matter . It discovers Americanisms in the writings of even the most decorous American authors , and when none can be found it notes the fact , half in patronizing approbation and half in incredulous surprise .

( A ) British English contains less slang than American English . ( B ) British English is lacking in humor . ( C ) The absorption of Americanism into British English is inevitable . ( D ) British English is no longer a growing language . ( E ) The alertness of literary critics has preserved the purity of British English .

She plans to be a high school teacher of biology . " There was too much math in the exam , " one pupil complained . " Not at - all , " retorted another , " too much English , if anything .
