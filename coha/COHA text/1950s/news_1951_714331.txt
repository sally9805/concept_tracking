txt The federal Corrupt Practices Act , Eparticularly as it governs political campaigns , urgently needs to be rewritten . It is outdated . It is full of loopholes which have developed since it was enacted . It is lax at some points , too stringent at others . It causes officials to wink at abuses of the law because it fails to take account of the sharp increases in the costs of conducting present-day election campaigns . Fortunately , a Senate Elections subcommittee is investigating current campaigning practices , and since its inquiry is under the fair-minded guidance of Senator Guy M. Gillette ( D ) of Iowa and Senator Margaret Chase Smith ( R ) of Maine , constructive proposals for changes in the law ought to be forthcoming . At present the subcommittee is examining what happened in the Ohio senatorial election of 1950 , and from the testimony thus far taken it is clear that what happened in Ohio shows that the Corrupt Practices Act of 1925 is not adequate in 1952 . A A 1-It needs to be stated at the outset that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings against either GOP Senator Robert A. Taft or his Democratic opponent , Joseph T. Ferguson , and that nothing has emerged tobelittle in any way Senator Taft 's 431,000-vote victory . Much that happened was beyond the knowledge of the principal candidates . But in the whole area of expenditures the campaign appears to bear little relationship to what is required by the 1925 law . Democratic witnesses alleged that some $5,000,000 was spent in the campaign to elect Senator Taft . Mr. Taft himself estimated ? the expenditures at $1,800,000 . The Republican witnesses alleged that at least $15,000 , - 000 was spent in the Ohio campaign in behalf of Mr. Ferguson . Mr. Ferguson himself estimated the expenditures at $800,000 . The fact probably is somewhere between these high and low figures . What concerns the Senate committee is that no firm accounting seems to be available anywhere  --  the facts just are not establishable . All the expenditures have not been reported according to law  --  by either side ; all the contributions have not been reported according to law  --  by either side . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " to put it as mildly as Senator Smith did the other day . The Democrats faked a picture showing Senator Taft and Communist Earl Browder together  --  an egregious unfairness . A pro-Ferguson labor pamphlet charged that Senator Taft was against public housing and cited that he voted for legislation which omitted any public housing provision . It carefully overlooked that he had introduced a public housing measure , had been praised by President Truman for his initiative , and had cast his final vote only after his efforts to include public housing had been defeated . The Ohio Republicans publicly charged that the Political Action Committee of the CIO , which was working against Senator Taft , " was conceived in communism , had Communist midwives assisting at its birth , and was carefully nurtured in its formative period by Communist teachers . " When Willis D. Gradison of Cincinnati , Senator Taft 's campaign manager , was asked about this statement at the Senate subcommittee hearing , he replied : " I certainly could n't back it up . " A A A Senator Mike Monroney ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $5,000 limit on individual campaign contributions , that individuals who give more than $100 be required to report their own contributions , and that the cost of political advertising be not deductible from income tax unless the advertising is " signed by the individual contributors with the approval of the candidate . " There is no doubt that congressional and presidential campaigns need updated legislation .
