The high tide of Protestant missions that once swept across the seas may seem to the unchurched an ebbing effort in a world of Communist persecution and colonial nationalism . But the tide is higher than ever , according to a new report by the Missionary Research Library . There are at least 10,000 more U.S. and Canadian Protestant missionaries at work around the world than there were in 1950 , and the total figure of 25,058 is more than four times as large as at the turn of the century , when the ' ' missionary era " seemed at its height . <P> The extra missionary stream comes from the smaller fighting sects rather than the old established churches . Example : the Seventh-day Adventists , with a membership of only 291,567 in the U.S. , have the most missionaries of all-2,000 men and women , including missionaries from the U.S. and other home bases , in 184 countries . And the Christian and Missionary Alliance ( membership : 87,663 ) has 822 missionaries abroad , or twice the number supported by the Protestant Episcopal Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First among the North American Protestant mission countries is now India , with 1,883 from the U.S. and Canada ; next comes Japan , with 1,549 . The Near and Middle East can claim only 2.96% of the total missionary force . Protestant women missionaries now outnumber the men by three to two .
