RO ... pg . 19 Letters to The Times Inquiring Into Inflation Senator Explains Aim of Hearings on Consumer Price Rise To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have read your editorial " Administered Prices " appearing in The New York Times.of July 3 with a great deal of interest . I am entering on these hearings with no preconceived notions except , one -- and that one is that the kind of inflation we are presently having will not succumb to the traditional monetary and fiscal controls because . it has not succumbed to them . We embarked op the s3-called " tight money policy , " the traditional deterrent to inflation , many months ago . But according to the most recent report of the Bureau of Labor Statistics the Consumer Price Index reached a new high in May , nearly 20 per cent above the 1947-49 average .. This was a record high for the ninth consecutive month , and was ' the fourteenth month out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase . Perhaps the increase would have been even greater without the " tight miney policy . " But it is also possible that the " tight money policy " had no effect at all , or only a negligible effect . The present inflationary picture ? which your editorial dismisses A a " moderate rise in prices " but which is far from moderate ? is further complicated by the fact that all prices have not risen to the same extent , ' nor indeed have all prices even participated in the ' advance . Uneven Behavior Thus , as I pointed out in my opening statement at the hearing , between May , 1956 , and May , 1957 , the wholesale prices of processed foods as a group have risen , but those of farm products have gone down . While prices of metal and metal products have increased , prices of lumber and wood products have fallen . And in the two groups which have shown the greatest increase ? ( 1 ) fuels and lighting , and ( 2 ) machinery and motive products  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity and declining production . Thus these increases certainly were not dictated by the laws of supply and demand , which the " tight money policy " is designed to affect . What are the reasons for these differences in price behavior ? How can prices go up in the face of declining demand and excess capacity ? To what extent are the increases centered in administered price industries ? To what extent are wage increases responsible ? To what extent are they associated with the long-time increase in economic concentration ? ( A forthcoming report of this subcommittee will show that between 1947 and 1954 the 200 largest manufacturing corporations increased their proportion of total value waded by manufacture from 30 to 37 per cent . ) Setting of Prices In what proportion of our economy are prices set automatically , by the unseen hand of competition , and in what part are they set by the conscious and deliberate action of corporate managers who have the power to set prices at alternative levels ? What should public policy be toward this power ? These are questions upon which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate ' the editorial caution with which you view our efforts in this field , because they are all questions on which many violent and preconceived notions exist . I can only say sincerely that as far as I am concerned I shall approach this problem in as scientific and nonpartisan a manner as I am capable of , for I believe this to be a field in which the paramount questions are those of sound public policy . I shall not prejudge the administered price . problem , and I trust in turn you will not prejudge the conduct of our hearings . ESTES KEFAI5VER . Washington , July 9 , 1957 . Meaning of Chinese Characters To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your author of Topics of The Times on July 7 embarked on treacherous waters when he started playing with the romanization of Chinese characters . The " tse " of Kung Fu-tse ( correctly Kung Fu-tzu ) has nothing in common with the " tse " of Mao Tse-tung . The first means son and by extension philosopher . The second means " marshy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisten , soak " - ( verb ) . - Hence Tse-tung might be rendered ' " to ' inundate the . East , " although I anr sure his parents never dreamed of such an interpretation back in 1893 . L. CARRINGTON GOODRICH , Department of Chinese and Japanese , Columbia University . New York ; July 8 , 1957 . . Fumes From Buses TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : . , The letter published . July ! 8 from the - Acting . Commissioner of the Department of Air ' Pollution Control , hi answer to : an earlier- letter Of complaint ; ' seerni to express the smug satisfaction of an official sitting comfortably behind . official . statistics . There is no doubt that the figures ' the Acting . Commissioner quotes are correct . But if they are correct as given with so little . obvious results of improvement in one small part of the job  --  fumes from buses  --  then the cost to the city ' of salaries . to . thirty.inspectors . Must . be enormous . May I. suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department should ? 1 ) e required to ride to and from their jobs on city buses as part of their official duty . I feel certain that this department would not Olen have to wait for complaints until they reach official notice . In this hot weather the fumes coming from buses as they start and leave bus stops , especially on the Fifty-ninth Street , the Seventyninth Street and the Ninety-sixth Street crosstown lines , may even fumigate the inertia of official smugness .

TO THE EbITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : - In an Associated Press dispatch dated July 6 a worried spokesman for the American automobile industry stated that the factor or factors - causing the unprecedented ' demand " for " small foreign cars " is " not at all-clean " I would Say that size has more to- do with their populArity , than anything else . ? ? Thousands of intelligent ' AMerf. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barge-like land cruisers , got to look like circus-wagons. - Practical people are sick of having to navigate the Detroit monstrosities iii traffic , wasting hours trying to li cate a parking space sufficiently large . Why . should : they endure it when they can get a- car that handles easily , fits into ' their garage:without trouble and  --  does n't cost ' a. $ much to buy or run ? . - - LOUIS W. SNOWDEN . New York , July 8 , 1957 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YoRK TIMES I have had occasion before to question " the accuracy of certain statements in some of the editorials of The New York Times pertaining to the Middle East . One can understand that a paper is entitled to its own opinions , but when it comes to= " facts , " then an honest editor will either record them correctly , even if they are not in line with his poiicy , or will refrain from writing on the subject . The statement to which I take exception is that appearing in " For Middle East Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitherto the Arab states have preferred to see the refugees remain in camps on Israel 's border in order to keep enmity against the . new state alive and to have ready ' recruits for guerrilla warfareagainst it . " In the first place , not one single " refugee camp " is located anywhere : near the border . The Arab states are being falsely accused that they oppose the resettlement of the refugees to cover up for Zionist perpetuation of human suffering . Henry Labouisse , director of U. N. R. W. A. for Palestine , has repeatedly informed the United Nations that " the outstanding factor which continues to condition refugee attitudes and to influence the policies of Near East Governments in this matter is the strong desire of the refugees to returr. to their homeland . This feeling has not diminished during the year , and its strength should not be underestimated . " ? U. N. Supplement No. - 15 ( A/2978 ) The attitude of the Arab states to the refugee problem was explicitly expressed before the U. N. Ad Hoc Political Committee and sufnmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these words : " The Arab countries would be quite prepared to welcome all the refugees who preferred to stay out of . Israel , but they have no power over the overwhelming majority of ' - refugees who want to go back . The door to peaceful negotiations was still open through the good offices , . : . of the Palestine Conciliati4 Corn- . mission . " As one of the million Arab refugees , let me make myself clear : I will never accept resettlement outside my own home in Jerusalem and will continue to insist on my full rights as an individual human being - ? in the same way that citizens of this country will not tolerate interference with their personal rights and prerogatives . And that goes for the other refugees . It is futile to harp on the " refusal of the Arab states . " The press in this country will do well to look the problem . straight in the face and tackle it strictly in accordance with United States principles of justice and the right of the individual to his property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . SAM HADAWI , The Palestine Arab Refugee Office . New York , July 8 , 1957 . For Colorful Paper Money TO THE EDITOR OF THENEW YORK TIMES : The identical color of United States dollar bills is very confusing to strangers , especially if their eye -- sight is not 100 per cent . - The world knows the Americandollar " greenback , " but why not give the other denominations different colors , even if it takes years to make the change-over ? As suggestions , perhaps the $5 , $10 and $20 bills could be printed in , say , blue , red and yellow , respectively , This would simplify values for tourists and visitors , supply a happy vernacular such as " bluebacks " and " redbacks " and would .. please American citizens , who like everything new . The appearance of your currency is obsolete . As old ' notes . are called in - for replacement why not mike the new issues colorful ? COLIN M.
