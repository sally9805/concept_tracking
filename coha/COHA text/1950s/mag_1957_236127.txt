Much of the current worry over the state of the economy can be crystallized into a single concern : Will the consumer keep on buying , or will he succumb to the notes of pessimism and tighten up his purse strings ? By the healthy ring of the nation 's cash registers last week , it was clear that the consumer has not suffered any recession jitters . The Federal Reserve Board reported that department-store sales for the previous week jumped 7% above the 1956 level , and that for the month ending in mid-February , sales increased in all but one of the nation 's twelve major purchasing zones . <P> One reason for the consumer 's confident spending is the fact that he is so well heeled . The U.S. Department of Labor announced that the net spendable earnings and the buying power of factory workers rose in January to record levels for the month ( though still slightly below the alltime peak of December 1956 ) . Though the cost of living is rising ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , millions of workers will keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts . <P> The consumer has shown some reluctance to buy certain goods , e.g. , sales of major appliances are off slightly . The big question now is whether this reluctance will carry over into new car sales , which regularly enjoy a big spring upsurge-though it failed to materialize last year . Auto manufacturers confidently produced an estimated 578,370 cars in February , 23,000 above last year 's rate , and intend to continue high production into March . Though General Motors ' sales are lagging and Chevrolet production is being cut this week , Ford and Chrysler are happily filling the gap , using heavy overtime to boost production . ( Chrysler has already shipped 10,390 Imperials for 1957 , more than all it sold of the 1956 model . ) This year so far auto manufacturers are keeping inventories firmly under control so that even if a warm-weather upsurge fails to develop they will not be caught with last year 's heavy stocks . But optimism is still far stronger than caution . Said a Chrysler official : " Our real worry is that we wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring demand . "
