At one grim stage in the struggle for Triangle Hill , American wounded flowing down the south slopes were fired on by Communist mortars and wounded again or killed . Some of the walking wounded were using their rifles for crutches . One grey-haired lieutenant colonel who had gone out on an artillery reconnaissance found himself leading a charge , died in the enemy trenches . <P> Triangle Hill is just north of Kumhwa , on the east face of the " Iron Triangle " ( Kumhwa-Chorwon-Pyongyang ) . Two miles east of Triangle is Sniper Ridge . Beyond them to the north towers a much higher peak called Papa-san ; the three together form a strong Communist bastion on the rugged central front . Last week the 31st Regiment of the U.S. 7th Division attacked Triangle , while South Koreans of the 2nd ROK Division stormed Sniper . <P> The first day 's assault on Triangle went badly , and the 7th 's doughfeet were pinned on the steep , sandy slopes . Eventually they drove the Chinese off the top and dug in behind barbed wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway . Thus protected , their machine-gunners mowed down wave after wave of counterattacking Chinese . Their mortar-men put smoke shells on Papa-san to blind the enemy spotters there , and U.N . planes blasted the Chinese assembly points . This week the Reds drove the Americans and ROKs back in a desperate night counterattack ; but when day came , the U.N . troops won back most of the lost ground . <P> Meanwhile , on the Iron Triangle 's west face , the brave and weary ROK 9th Division was mopping up on White Horse Hill ( TIME , Oct. 20 ) . The South Koreans had found that they could hold the crest if they kept the Chinese off the neighboring knobs ; and the enemy was holding by his fingernails only to three knobs , known as the Three Sisters . The Koreans tunneled under the Three Sisters , laid massive charges of TNT , and blew the knobs and most of the Chinese on them to smithereens . After that , White Horse seemed secure . <P> Fighting flared up last week at other points along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory ( TIME , Aug. 25 ) , at places called Finger Ridge and Iron Horse . Correspondents who saw last week 's battles reported severe U.N . casualties-especially in U.S. dead and wounded on Triangle Hill .
