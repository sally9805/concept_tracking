WASHINGTON , June 2 ? The Supreme Court of the United States ruled , 6 to 3 , today that President neuman 's seizure of the steel industry to avert a strike violated the Constitution by usurping the legislative powers reserved to Congress . The President bowed promptly by directing Secretary of Commerce Charles Sawyer to release the properties to their private owners , and the United Steelworkers of America , C. I. 0. , went on strike . As a result of the walkout the . Government ordered a halt in deliveries of steel from retail warehouses to consumer goods producers in an effort to conserve steel for defense needs . Authorities said the action was directed at preventing a drain on warehouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Manufacturers who ordinarily receive steel from warehouses will continue to do so , they added . No order was issued against steel exports . The Supreme Court justices who voted to uphold District Judge David A. Pine 's order dispossessing the Government were : Hugo L. Black , Felix Frankfurter , William 0 . Douglas , Robert H. Jackson , Harold H. Burton and Tom C. Clark . Dissenting were : Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Justices Stanley F. Reed and Sherman Minton . Founding Fathers ' Action Cited The court ruled in effect that when the President seized the steel mills he seized the lawmaking power , because only Congress could authorize the taking of pd . vete property for public use . " The Constitution did not subject this law-making power of Congress to Presidential or military supervision or control , " said the opinion of the court , written by Justice Black . " The founders of this nation ' entrusted the lawmaking power to the Congress alone in both good and bad times , " it added . " It would do no good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hopes for freedom that lay behind their choice . Such a review would but confirm our holding that this seizure order can not stand . " Chief Justice Vinson , writing a vigorous dissent , declared that the President 's action to keep steel flowing was warranted by the world emergency . " History bears out the genius of the founding fathers , who created a Government subject to law buf not left subject to inertia when vigor and initiative are required , " the Chief Justice wrote . Vinson Criticizes Majority " As the district judge stated , this is no time for ' timorous ' judi ? cial action , " he declared . " Buf neither is this a time for timorous executive action . " Chief Justice Vinson said the majority of the court , not the mi ? nority , was seeking to amend the Constitution . He declared : " The broad Executive power granted by Article II to an offices on duty 365 days a year can not , it is said , be invoked to avert disaster . " Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress recommending action . Under this messenger-buy concept of the office , the President can not even act to preserve legislative programs from destruction so that Congress will have something left to act upon . " The court , contrary to a widely // held expectation among lawyers , grasped the Constitutional issue firmly and interpreted it without equivocal language . It might have disposed of the case without reaching the ultimate question ; indeed , it is the practice of the judiciary to do so whenever possible . The court acted with unusual speed . Legal controversies often take years in their course through the three levels of the Federal judiciary . This decision came less than eight weeks after the President seized the steel mills . The seizure took effect on April 9 . The district court granted the steel companies ' injunction against seizure on April 29. - The Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the injunction the next day . The Supreme Court accepted the case the same week and heard oral argument on May 12 . In the three-week interval since argument was heard , the justices wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Each of the six justices in the majority wrote concurring opinions . Only Justices Reed and Minton refrained from writing . The history-making case hereafter will be known to law students and lawyers as Youngstown Co. v. Sawyer . Opinions Take 2 ! /2 Hours Delivery of the opinions took two hours and thirty-five minutes . The court convened at noon and Chief Justice Vinson announced that , contrary to custom , the admissions lof attorneys to practice before the Supreme Court would be deferred until later . Usually that is the first order of business . Justice Black started reading the opinion of the court at 12:01 . It I was comparatively brief , and he finished about 12:15 . Justice Frankfurter followed with his concurring opinion . He spoke for thirty minutes and scarcely referred to the printed page , except near the end of his opinion . He did not follow the precise language of his opinion . He used the expression once , " almost a suckling knows that , " but the context was not clear . At another point Justice Frankfurter appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted at length from a 1914 brief of John W. Davis as Solicitor General of the United States . Mr. Davis had argued for the steel companies in this case , and Chief Justice Vinson turned his 1914 phrases against him . Justice Frankfurter said " I do n't understand the relevance of quoting the brief of a lawyer in a case * with the well-known astigmatism of advocates . " Positions in Past Recalled Chief Justice Vinson also cited the positions taken by Justices Jackson and Clark with respect to the President 's powers when their were Attorneys General . Referring extemporaneously to Justice Jackson in what was taken to be friendly sarcasm , the Chief Justice remarked that changing one 's mind is " evidence of strength . " At that point Justice Black turned and caught Justice Jackson 's eye two seats away and grinned , at him . Justice Jackson reciprocated . The Chief Justice continued to refer to Justice Jackson 's position as Attorney General in the seizure of the North American plant in June , 1941 , when Mr. Jackson was Attorney General . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seizure then as vigorously and as forcefully " as he ordi- , narily does now . " The lawyers caught the inflection on " ordinarily " and there was a spontaneous burst of laughter . Justice , Jackson joined in it . Chief Justice Vinson was delivering his opinion when the court 's regular luncheon hour of 2 o'clock arrived . He continued until he finished at 2:35 and the court then recessed for thirty minutes . Clark in Different Approach The differences among the six majority opinions were mainly differences in emphasis , except Justice Clark 's . He said he concurred in the judgment , but not the opinion , of the court . He used a different approach to the same conclusion , declaring that the President 's reservoir of nonstatutory powers was not available to him when Congress had provided statutory procedures . Justice Clark referred particularly to the plant seizure provision of the Selective Service Act . He expressed skepticism of the Administration 's contention that it had complied in substance with the intent of the Taft-Hartley law 's eighty-day injunction provision by persuading the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burton , who was most interested during the argument in the President 's nonuse of the Taft Hartley injunction , came to no conclusion on that point . He grounded his position on the non-existence of , statutory support for the seizure . Justice Jackson 's Views Justice Jackson saw a tendency of Congress to abdicate its powers . He wrote : - " But I have no illusion that any decision by . this court can keep power in the hands of Congress if it is not wise and timely in meeting its problems . A crisis , that challenges the President equally , or perhaps primarily , challenges Congress . " If not good law , there was Iwordly wisdom in the maxim ' attributed to Napoleon that the tools belting to the man who can use them . ' We may say that power to legislate for emergencies belongs in the hands of Congress , but only Congress itself can prevent power from slipping through its fingers . " Justice Douglas , too , referred to Congress , though not so pointedly . " The Congress , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare , " he said . " Justice Frankfurter declared that Congress ' had consciously withheld seizure power from the President . Here and there in the opinions reversing the President there were friendly expressions directed to Mr , Truman the man , and the justices seemed to be saying that this was a decision for the ages and must be viewed impersonally . Justice Frankfurter , for example , said : " It is absurd to see a dictator in a representative product of the sturdy democratic traditions of the Mississippi Valley . The accretion of dangerous power does not come in a day . It does come , however slowly , from the generative forces of unchecked disregard of the restrictions that fence in even the most disinterested assertion of authority . " Again , in concluding , Justice Frankfurter said , " It is not a pleasant judicial duty to find that the President has exceeded his powers and still less so when his purposes were dictated by concern for the nation 's well-being , in the assured conviction that he acted to avert danger . " Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of checks and balances , for ' the distribution of power among the three branches of ? government . It is a price that today may seem exorbitant to many . Today a kindly President uses the seizure power to effect ' a wage increase and to keep the steel furnaces in production . Yet tomorrow another President might use the same power to prevent a wage increase , to curb trade unionists , to regiment labor as oppressively as industry thinks it has been regimented by this seizure . " Justice Jackson said : " I am not alarmed that it would plunge us straightway into dictatorship , but it is at least a step in that wrong direction . " Chief Justice Vinson stressed the emergency aspect of the seizure . " One is not here called upon even to consider the possibility of Executive seizure of a farm , a corner grocery store or even a single industrial plant , " he said . " Such considerations arise only when one ignores the central fact of this case  --  that the nation 's entire basic steel production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government seizure . " The Chief Justice recounted the seizures made by Presidents , beginning with President Lincoln through World War II . He dwelt extensively on the Midwest oil seizure cases , which Mr. Davis , the steel companies ' present chief counsel , argued effectively for the Government in 1914 , and on the North American Company seizure without statutory support before the Pearl Harbor attack . " The Attorney General ( Jackson ) vigorously proclaimed that the President had the moral duty to keep this nation 's defense effort a Hgoing concern , ? the Chief Justice wrote . " His ringing moral justification was coupled with a legal justification equally well stated I* * He quoted at length from I Attorney General Jackson 's opinion at the time . 1949 Clark Letter Cited The . Chief Justice also referred in a footnote to a letter written by Attorney General Clark , now Justice Clark , informing the Senate Labor Committee in 1949 that in his opinion the emergency powers of the President were " exceedingly great . " Justice Jackson met the North , American issue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft production in that case was a Communist insurrection , that the plant was under direct contact with the Government to supply defense items , that man , agement.acquiesced in the seizure , and that many of the employes were at the gates trying to work . Justice Jackson observed : " The North American seizure was regarded as an execution of Congressional policy . I do not regard it as a precedent for this , but , even if I did , I should not bind present judicial judgment by earlier partisan advocacy . " Arthur Goldberg , Counsel of the ( steel workers union , in a state ' meet after the decision emphasized that the court had ruled only on seizure , on which the union had taken no position in the argument . He added : " The court did not decide , as the steel companies had urged it to do , that the President should ' have used a Taft-Hartley injunction against the union . The United Steelworkers of America believes that the union 's contention before the court and the public that the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been vindicated by the failure of any one of the justices of the Supreme Court to accept the companies ' Taft-Hartley argument .
