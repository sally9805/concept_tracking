The suit , which was thrown out by Judge Walter J. LaBuy in Chicago last December , charged that a substantial stock ownership gave the du Pont interests control of General Motors . This resulted , the Government asserted , in a gigantic combination in violation of the antitrust laws . The Justice Department appealed the juage 's ruling , and the high court agreed to hear the appeal . A date for arguments will be set later . In another action , the Supreme Court turned down a Government re4uest to fix Louisiana 's seaward boundary at three geographical miles from its shore .

Stock Disposal Sought The Government 's suit sought to comple the du Pont companies to dispose of their stock interest in General Motors and withdraw from any controlling ' position in its affairs . The magnitude of the case is illustrated , by estimates that the combined ' resources of the two industrial , groups total more than $5,000 , - 000,000 . Some lawyers describe the case as . the biggest antitrust suit ever tried in this country . Justice Tom C. Clark and John M. Harlan did not participate in the du Pont-General Motors case . Justice Clark was Attorney General when the suit was instituted in 1949 . Justice Harlan , while in private practice , was one of the many lawyers retained by . du ? Pont in connection with the case . The Government 's suit charged originally that the du Pont company , General Motors , the United States Rubber Company ; two holding companies , a bank and individual members of the du Pont family had engaged since 1915 in a conspiracy to restrain interstate commerce and trade in a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Motors and United States Rubber .

Since March , 1918 ,  --  the Government asserted , the du Pont interests have owned at least 23 per cent of the General Motors stock . Since 1923 , " du Pont officials and persona closely affiliated with that company have served in important posts in the General Motors organization , " the Government charged . ' This stock . ownership and close working relationship between the two . huge concerns , according ' to the Government , gave the . du Pont . interests " working control " over General Motors . It exercised this control , the complaint charged , to obtain preference over its competitors in ' the sale to General Motors of products that it manufactures .

The motor company 's purchases from du Pont , he said , were the result of its , independent judgment , not pressure or domination by du Pont . The same was true of the arlrangement by which General Motors gave the du Pont companies exclusive right to exploit far their own  --  benefit the motor company 's chemical discoveries , the judge declared . The Government argued , in its ' appeal brief filed in the Supreme Court , that Judge LaBuy 's judgments were erroneous . The main purpose of the du Pont interests in acquiring General Motors stock , according to the Government , was to obtain preference over competitors in the sale of its products to General Motors , not just for profitable investment , as stated in Judge LaBuy 's opinion .
