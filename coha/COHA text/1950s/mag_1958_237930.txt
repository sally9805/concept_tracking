The Pabst Brewing Co. has sponsored so many TV boxing matches that its name has practically become synonymous with fighting . Last week Pabst reluctantly sponsored one more fight-the first proxy fight in its 94-year history . The ring was a igth-floor hall in Chicago 's Merchandise Mart . In one corner was short , pudgy Pabst President and Chairman Harris Perlstein , wearing grey suit , tan shoes and grey tie . In the other , the challengers : Robert and David Pabst , the grandsons of the Pabst founder , Fred Pabst , and Otto and Carl Spaeth , son and grandson respectively of the founder of Premier Malt , which bought out Pabst in 1932 . <P> The Pabst-Spaeth group blamed Perlstein for the fact that the company has dropped from No. 1 in 1949 to eighth among U.S. brewers , last month reported a loss for 1957 of $2,871,200 . The stock has dropped from 32 to 4 . Fearing for their 25% share of the stock , the Pabst brothers enlisted the aid of the Spaeths to unseat Perlstein as president at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang last week , Perlstein swarmed all over the opposition , won an easy knockout . His slate of directors polled 56% of the votes cast . After the count , the vanquished did not even get the chance to speak ; when David Pabst tried to make a statement for the record , Perlstein cut him off-in the interest , he explained , of a brief meeting . <P> Behind the fight was a longstanding feud between Perlstein and the Pabst family . Perlstein was president of Premier Malt when it took over the old Pabst Corp . in 1932 in anticipation of Prohibition 's demise . He became president of the new Premier-Pabst Corp. , and Fred Pabst , son of the founder , later became chairman . Perlstein led the company through its period of greatest growth and profitmaking , saw it reach its biggest year in 1949 with a sales peak of $168,994,000 . But Perlstein soon found himself hurt by his own success . Hit hard by the steadily flattening beer market , Pabst sales slid steadily . To make matters worse , Perlstein drew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get more family members into the business . <P> When Fred Pabst retired in 1954 , leaving the company without a Pabst as an officer for the first time in 90 years , the Pabst family increased pressure on Perlstein to bring in a new man to run the company . Perlstein brought in as president Marshall S. Lachner , a vice president of Colgate-Palmolive Co. , kept the chairmanship for himself . But Lachner failed to halt Pabst 's sliding sales , and in 1956 , for the first time in its history , the company showed a loss . Last fall Perlstein got Lachner 's resignation , took over as president as well as chairman , began reversing many Lachner policies . One new policy suited Lachner . Perlstein insisted on a severance contract providing Lachner with more than $3,000 a month through 1961 , so long as he makes no criticisms of the Pabst firm or its officers during that time . So far , Lachner has kept prudently mum .                  @ @ @
