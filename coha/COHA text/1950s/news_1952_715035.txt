The session lasted an hour . Hiss faced George G. Killinger , chairman of the federal parole board and former head of the army clemency and parole board , ' who has been listening for three days to parole petitions of more than 100 convicts . The two men had never met before . Record to Remain Secret The only others present were a stenografer , w h o recorded Hiss ' appeal and the ensuing questions and answers , and a prison official . Waiting reporters and photografers were not even permitted to wait outside the receiving gate . T1 ? 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Killinger said . Therarwere no dramatics , according to reports . Prison confinement does not appear to have shaken the stoicism of Hiss , who maintained an iron composure from his first congressional committee hearing in 1948 until the final jury verdict of guilty on Jan. 21 , 1950 . He used his legal and diplomatic training , polished in the highest Iiillingcr left and His . international circles , to present his appeal with skilled restraint .
