When General Motors ' Buick Division plucked its $20 million account from the hands of Manhattan 's Kudner Agency after 22 years of going steady ( TIME , Jan. 6 ) , Madison Avenue buzzed that <P> Kudner might soon have to return every token of its romance with G.M. Kudner hoped not . Though the agency lost nearly a third of its billings with Buick 's departure , it still had hopes of holding on to its remaining General Motors ' accounts ( which made up nearly 40% of billings ) , immediately announced a change in top command . Last week Kudner knew the worst-all reconciliation had failed . Out went two more G.M. accounts , Frigidaire and the G.M.C. Truck and Coach Division , billing about $9,000,000 a year . <P> G.M. 's gradual departure from Kudner was due in part to dissatisfaction with the agency 's recent handling of G.M. accounts . Yet some Detroiters attributed the falling-out to the very closeness of their long relationship . As they told it , the longtime friendship between former Kudner President J. H. S. Ellis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had to grin and bear it as Ellis went over their heads to Curtice with his problems . When Kudner fell into disfavor with Buick , other division heads called an open season on the agency , aware that Curtice , who is scheduled to retire next year , would be hard pressed to defend it . As of last week , Kudner had only four small G.M. accounts worth some $6.000,000 left-Fisher Body , Allison Engine , Cleveland Diesel , Detroit Diesel . Madison Avenue was taking bets on which would be the next to go , and who would pick up Frigidaire and G.M.C. Truck . One leading possibility : McCann-Erickson , which gave up Chrysler to take over Buick. is anxious for a crack at the rest of G.M. 's big business-though it would have to give up its Westinghouse account to take on rival Frigidaire.
