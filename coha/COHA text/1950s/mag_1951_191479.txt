The U.S. was moving swiftly last week to set up an air screen in a neglected sector : North Africa ( see map ) . By agreement with France , the U.S. would put an estimated $30 million and some 20,000 men into French Morocco . Six enlarged and reconstructed bases , plus one new field , to handle all types of U.S. fighting aircraft , would be ready by midsummer . <P> Another agreement with Britain , almost completed , provided for improvement and U.S. use of R.A.F. bases protecting Africa : Bengasi and Castel Benito in Libya ; Habbaniya and Shaibah in Iraq ; airfields around the Suez Canal ; Amman in Jordan ; Cyprus and Malta in the Mediterranean . With the new bases , a U.S. plane taking off from Cyprus , for example , would have to fly only 1,500 miles to Moscow , 1,000 miles to Baku . The U.S. already held giant Wheelus Field near Tripoli ( also being enlarged ) , and an airbase at Dhahran in Saudi Arabia . <P> The French agreement had been signed in December , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press from a Paris official last week . No time was being lost . Bulldozers had already been unloaded in French Morocco , the first group of engineers was on the ground , ships laden with airfield equipment were en route . The seven Moroccan fields were at Port Lyautey , Marrakech , Casablanca , Meknes , Rabat , Kourigha , Nouasseur . The incoming Americans would find the flat , sparsely wooded terrain ideal for military aircraft bases , but would run into difficulties with the heat ( 120 in the summer shade ) and the housing ( very tight ) . <P> Moroccan shopkeepers began hoarding luxury goods and hiding their perfumes in happy anticipation of free-spending G.I.s . But there was a more realistic brand of rejoicing . Said a French official on the spot : " This proves that Morocco is considered a bastion of Europe . "
