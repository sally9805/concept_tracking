In Washington this week , the Foreign Ministers of France and Britain will meet with the U.S. Secretary of State to ponder the state of the Western World . A " poor man 's Bermuda " was what Washington wags called it , for this was a last-minute substitute for the conference of the Big Three leaders which was called off by the illness of Winston Churchill . The foreign secretaries will meet in less dramatic fashion in an air-conditioned room on the eleventh floor of the old State Department Annex . But their mission is just as important : to reinvigorate a taken-for-granted alliance that has shown signs of wilting in the hot , unexpected gusts of the Soviet " peace offensive . " <P> The agenda for the conference : <P> 1 ) Trends in the Soviet Union . <P> 2 ) Developments in Germany . <P> 3 ) Western Europe 's defense ( NATO , EDC , etc . ) . <P> 4 ) Korea . <P> 5 ) Indo-China . <P> The answers to all five turn on the interpretation of one : widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eying the headlines on troubles in Hungary , East Germany , Czechoslovakia and Rumania , are vaguely aware of a chance to exploit the Reds ' weakness and strike a blow for freedom . The question is where and how , and answers are not yet forthcoming ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . Europe , by contrast , seems more relieved than challenged . Far from seeking ways to press the West 's advantage , the French in particular seem to regard the Soviet " thaw out " and the East German uprising as further proof that the Red army is in no shape to invade Western Europe . As a result , the French are in even less of a hurry today than they were six months ago to agree to a European army and West German rearmament . The West Germans , too , are less inclined to accept Konrad Adenauer 's stern insistence that they must join arms with the West before they can think of negotiating with the Russians for a unified Germany . Chancellor Adenauer faces the toughest election of his life in September . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions to make .
