After two miles the field remained a moving mass of color , half a dozen horses still in contention coming up to the final hedges of the $50,000 Temple Gwathmey , the richest steeplechase in the world . Then , as if he were tired of company , a steel-muscled brute named Neji shouldered his all-but-impossible impost of 173 lbs. , sailed over the last jump like a larking colt , sprinted down the Belmont stretch and won by seven lengths . <P> The performance was no surprise to anyone-not to the chalk players who had watched Neji win Belmont 's Grand National just the week before , nor to Alfred Patrick Smithwick , who is the chestnut champion 's pilot , nor to his brother Daniel Michael Smithwick , who nursed Neji into shape for the race of his life . These days the only steeplechase surprise is when a horse handled by Pat and Mike Smithwick is shut out of a big purse . <P> The brother act was bred to the sport in the fox-hunting country around Monkton , Md . Like their father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were earning their living as show-horse trainers while in their teens . In 1950 some friends bought them an Irish mare that showed signs of speed , and they took their stable to the races . To eke out their small winnings . Pat , the smaller of the two ( he carries a solid 160 lbs . on a 5-ft. - 11- in. frame ) , peeled off poundage and learned the rough art of the jumping jockey . Mike sharpened his skills as trainer . Both of them did so well that last season Pat was the country 's leading steeplechase jock , and Mike was chosen by Mrs. Ogden Phipps to take over from her retiring trainer , Pete Bostwick . <P> Among other horses , the Phipps stable had Neji . But the top jumper of 1955 had pulled up lame after the Midsummer Hurdle Handicap of 1956 and seemed to be through with racing . It took all Mike 's talents to make the horse whole . This year his perseverance , combined with Paddy 's skill in the jockey 's irons , has paid off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , is already steeplechase horse of the year . Barring injury , the big chestnut has a long career ahead in which to build on his earnings of $233,625-only $1,600 less than Elkridge , alltime steeplechase champion .
