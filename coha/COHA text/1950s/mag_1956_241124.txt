Out of the shadows behind the Speaker 's chair , a tall , lank figure made his way to the front bench , flopped down , and put his long legs up on the table . Sir Anthony Eden was making his first appearance in the House of Commons since his collapse at the height of the Suez crisis . Some Tories put up a polite cheer . One or two rose but hastily subsided when they realized no one else was joining them . Other Tories sat mutely staring straight in front of them . The Labor benches kept a stony silence , leaving the Tory welcome starkly revealed in all its thinness . <P> In succeeding days , Eden coped doggedly with a barrage of harassing questions from the Opposition , a lonely man flanked by a depressed and worried party . Like hounds worrying a fox , Laborites pressed their charge that there had been collusion between Britain . France and Israel in the attack on Suez . <P> Eden parried and dodged , then said flatly , thumping the dispatch box angrily : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dishonorable activity is completely untrue , and I must emphatically deny it . " Liberal Leader Joseph Grimond , still not satisfied , demanded to know whether the government could categorically deny that it had had information that Israel was going to attack Egypt . The House rang with cries of " Answer , answer . " Finally Eden got to his feet . " There was not foreknowledge that Israel would attack Egypt-there was not , " he insisted . " But there was something else . There was-we knew it perfectly well-a risk of it , and in the event of risk of it , certain discussions and conversations took place , as I think was absolutely right ... " <P> All week long Eden assured his fellow Tories that the country backed him , insisted that he would have no misgivings about winning a general election even if it came tomorrow , but was determined not to call an election for two years . His optimistic thesis was jarred by a by-election to fill the seat of ex-Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anthony Nutting , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melton Mowbray is in the heart of Toryland , a section of fox-hunting squires and prosperous Leicestershire farmers . In the 1955 election , Nutting , who lived in the district , won 61% of the votes . This year , as added insurance , the government sent down a batch of top-level speakers to plead the Tory case . At week 's end the returns came in . The Tory candidate ( the woman head of a pottery works in distant Yorkshire ) won the seat . But the Tory vote had dropped by an alarming 7% , the Tory majority from 1955 's 10,780 to a modest 2,362.
