When Rome 's picture weekly , La Setti-mana Incom , hit the newsstands last week , Italians took one look at its cover and rushed to buy . Although Ingrid Bergman has permitted no photographs of herself and child , Incom 's cover showed a joyful Ingrid cooing to her newborn babe in a hospital room , while Roberto Rossellini , the doctor , the nurse and even the Madonna ( from a painting on the wall ) seemed to beam with approval . Incom 's teasing caption : " The Strange Story of This Photograph . " <P> Inside , Incom told the story , which would not have sounded strange to readers of New York 's old tabloid Evening Graphic. - The picture was a fake-or what Incom called a photomontage . Incom 's editors had cut out the heads from an old photo of Ingrid and Roberto , and with some paste and an artist 's deft strokes , superimposed them , with others , on a photograph posed against the background of a hospital room ( see cut ) . For readers who might feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a diagram showing how they were mated . The stunt paid off . Incom sold a record 260,000 copies , one-third more than its usual circulation . Among the purchasers : Roberto Rossellini , who , in a fine Italian fury , telephoned Incom 's office to bellow that Incom 's general manager , Sandro Pal-lavicini , was a bastard . Two rival picture weeklies were less bold and less convincing-Oggi , with a cover showing Ingrid and Roberto looking fondly at a baby that was obviously several months old , and Tempo , which showed a pensive Ingrid reclining on a pillow . <P> <P> - When Graphic Editor Emile Gauvreau lamented that the judge had barred photographers from the sensational Kip Rhinelander annulment case ( 1925 ) , an artist made a " composograph " -a combination of several photographs-to " show " the courtroom scene with Mrs. Rhinelander stripped to the waist . The Graphic 's circulation jumped 100,000 copies .
