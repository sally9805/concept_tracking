A letter from Mr. Roger Horlick of the Board of Governors of the Happy Knoll Country Club to Mr. Albert Magill , its President Emeritus , regarding the coming-out party given on the club premises by Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey Bledsoe for their daughter . // Dear Albert : I am writing you in behalf of the Board of Governors to ask your help regarding a clash of personalities which at present is rocking the Happy Knoll Country Club . Our problem primarily has to do with Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey Bledsoe , whom you know better than I , and who yesterday were responsible for an emergency meeting of the Board . You are doubtless going to say that the Bledsoes are not the sort of people who could possibly cause such trouble . The Cromley crowd who have been drinking even more over weekends than usual  --  perhaps . The Athertons and the rest of that married group who live in that Beaver Hollow development  --  no doubt , but the Bledsoes  --  certainly not . I know that you will also say , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help with next year 's deficit . This is exactly why the Governors decided that you might care to write him personally instead of our sending him a more formal communication . I may also add , the feeling is unanimous that you should do this , since it was you who were recently most vocal in advising that the facilities of Happy Knoll should be thrown open to young people , and thus it is largely because of you that the Bledsoes used the club last Friday evening for the coming-out party of their daughter , Alicia. // I know you will say that you at least have not forgotten that girls will be girls and boys , boys , and that you can illustrate this by some stories of your own youth and mine which , frankly , are about as outmoded as a T-model Ford . I also recall distinctly how you feel about young Alicia Bledsoe , who is known to her friends as Allie . I recall one afternoon last spring when we were sitting on the terrace by the new bar watching the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention was so drawn to Allie Bledsoe that you expressed the wish that girls in our time had dressed more like her , since then the process of natural selection might have gone on in a more unimpeded manner . You then ended your statement by saying she was " well stacked up . " // I recall I told you to use the language of your age group and added that the younger generation were becoming a real problem at Happy Knoll . In fact , only that day Old Ned at the bar had suggested that it might be better at the young people 's dances to serve young boys of 15 slender shots of bourbon rather than to let them drink it privately behind the bushes of the parking area . This made you indignant . You said that you also had sampled alcohol when you were 15 and if you were 15 again you would repeat and do a lot more besides . It was a pity , you said , that we had not faced the problems of youth as frankly and fearlessly as young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger generation is disillusioned and has lost its sense of security . // Frankly , Albert , I am growing a little weary lately of observing the lengths that young people now go in their search for security . I am also tired of hearing about " lost generations . " If I remember rightly , this phrase started when a young man from Princeton , named F. Scott Fitzgerald , wrote a novel entitled This Side of Paradise in which he revealed that boys and girls , disillusioned by the antiquities of World War I , exchanged furtive embraces in their fathers ' limousines . I reread this novel the other day and found it was very pallid stuff . Ask Allie Bledsoe if I am not right , or stay around for a while during one of our Saturday dances at Happy Knoll where Allie and her contemporaries are seeking for security . // Frankly , there was an unusually vigorous search for security at Alicia 's coming-out party the other night where the latest lost generation , in striving to find itself , not only broke plates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us would bother you about this if it had not caused bad feeling and high words among parents who are solid members of the club . Naturally high animal spirits should be discounted and so should a little malicious gossip . I can also agree that our young people today are under a strain of uncertainty , but I only wish they would remember that everyone else is under a similar strain , especially the Board of Governors of the Happy Knoll Country Club . // The Board resents being blamed for what happened last Friday night . It is not our duty to censor the manners and morals of dancing parties , which should be up to parents . The trouble is that parents also have become demoralized , especially at Happy Knoll . For example , in view of the complaints that were showered upon the Governors regarding events of last Friday night , it was necessary to conduct several purely informal investigations . In the course of these it transpired that several young people , who do not wish their names mentioned , distinctly saw young Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner and remove the silver polo mallets from the hands of the interestingly sculptured riders that decorate the top of the urn of the old Gibbs Polo Trophy that was won by Happy Knoll in 1887 . On learning what had become of the polo mallets , we immediately communicated with Willie 's father , asking that they be returned . Instead of being cooperative , he was furious , not at his son , but at the Board of Governors for insinuating that Willie should have committed such an act . It was also discovered that young Charlie Cromley stole the memorial portrait of old Jerry Farnsworth in his plus fours from the Pendleton Room . When Cromley Sr. was asked to have it returned , he , too , was furious . ( The portrait , in case you are worried , has just been discovered in a drugstore window . ) Then there was what is now referred to as " the scene " by the swimming pool which the Board of Governors decided not to investigate at all . Rumor has it that one of the Gridley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attempted a strip-tease act on the diving board and failed to complete it only because she fell accidently into the water . Simply because of these rumors , Mrs. Gridley , who has always seemed to me formidable , is threatening to sue the Country Club for defamation of character . Bernice , she says , was pushed into the swimming pool by a young man from New Rochelle who should not have been at the party at all . Even so , Bernice did not remove a single stitch of clothing and Mrs. Gridley says that she can prove it . // Well , so it goes . These are only casual samples of a number of curious events that occurred last Friday night . Yet whenever anyone is accused of being concerned with these happenings , it seems that all our young of Happy Knoll are innocent children who scarcely touched a drop of the champagne that Mr. Bledsoe vulgarly offered them . It seems , however , that there were other sinister forces afoot  --  unidentified young men who crashed the party and in particular a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These individuals , it seems , none of whom can be identified , were responsible for all pilferings and all disorders last Friday . // It was the hope of the Board of Governors that this situation could be unraveled at least slightly and that bills for breakage and damage would be cheerfully shared by various responsible parties . This , it appears , is not to be the case . It seems that your poor friend , Mr. Godfrey Bledsoe , must foot the bill alone , which is going to be unexpectedly heavy . This is why we are asking you to write a letter that will break the news to Mr. Bledsoe pleasantly . The suggested draft I enclose will be useful to you largely because of the information it contains . Please feel free to say what you like , but along these lines and in this spirit : // Dear Godfrey : I wish that I might have been with you and Bertha at the Happy Knoll Country Club the other Friday . I hear it was a delightful occasion and you know how partial I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Justice Holmes , I almost find myself saying , oh to be 70 again ! As you and Bertha have often heard me remark , boys will be boys and girls will be girls , no matter what steps one takes to prevent it and I believe that Happy Knoll should have the accent of youth and would indeed be a sad place without it . // If the Friday night party got a little out of hand in the hours of the morning after , this was not your fault and should be attributed only to the informality of the times in which we live and after all , what is a country club for if one can not have fun in it ? Your guests were checked from a list at the door ; you cut down on the champagne supply at midnight and gave orders that none should be served after 2 a.m. ; the club bar itself closed on the stroke of 2 a.m. , and old Ned , who has been a loyal Happy Knoll employee ever since the repeal of prohibition , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment when he assured you that everything was under control and that you and Mrs. Bledsoe could go home . Old Ned , in making this prediction , could not be everywhere at once . In fact , no one can be everywhere at once at a gay debutante party . There was no reason for you and Mrs. Bledsoe to have known that your party was still continuing at about noon on Saturday . You were still asleep when Mr. Bedard , from the front office , attempted to communicate with the Board of Governors , who invited some of your guests , still in vestiges of their evening clothes , to leave the bar and swimming pool . The Governors want me to assure you that they did this with great reluctance because tolerance is one of our Happy Knoll watchwords. // However , it did seem by then that things had gone far enough . As always happens on such occasions , a few repairs must be made to furnishings and grounds and I am taking the liberty of listing some examples so that you 'll not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) Mr. Swivens ' electric golf mobile was discovered in the course of the evening by some of your guests , said not to belong to Happy Knoll . It was run over the 9th , 10th and 16th greens , all of which will need renovation , and the vehicle itself was abandoned on the 14th fairway , almost a total wreck . // 2 ) The large Persian rug in the Pendleton Room was cut into narrow strips which were tied together to form a rope for a tug-of-war game on the tennis courts . The rug is beyond repair . // 3 ) A more than ordinary amount of glass and silverware was thrown into the pool , necessitating a thorough cleaning . // 4 ) A peculiar situation developed at the bar . Old Ned , whose eyesight is not what it used to be , has discovered a number of bar checks signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower , Douglas MacArthur and other notables . The total of these will be available shortly . // 5 ) An unusual interest was taken in the club trophies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared as has the Happy Knoll Bridge Bowl . The gold-plated figure of a golfer has gone from the top of the Happy Knoll Challenge Urn and the silver polo mallets have been removed from the polo trophy . These are small matters but will need prompt attention . // 6 ) The customary allowance for wear , tear and breakage appears to have been inadequate . Two sofas caught afire , one by accident and one on purpose since someone , not a member of Happy Knoll , conceived the idea of building a bonfire to greet the sunrise . This fortunately was checked by Mr. Bedard , but not wholly in time . // 7 ) Pete , the caddie master , who was kind enough to help the house staff during the latter part of the evening , broke his arm in a friendly scuffle . It is doubtful whether this damage comes under the head of workmen 's compensation . // There will be some other items , but I do believe that these are the main ones . We hope you will feel that they indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been termed one of the most active in the history of Happy Knoll and one long to be remembered . // Sometime in the near future I hope you will tell me all about it yourself . As I say , I am deeply sorry not to have been present . Cordially yours , // I think this is about the way the letter should be written . There is no reason for complaint and recrimination . A good-natured calling to attention ought to be enough . Frankly , the whole affair has taught us a great deal at Happy Knoll and we are already considering precautionary measures to be used in future festivities . Live and learn is always our motto , but please get your letter off as soon as possible and please let us know what reply you elicit . // With all best wishes for a continued happy holiday , Yours , as always , Roger Horlick
