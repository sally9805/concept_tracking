From an eighth-grade education in 1940 , the median schooling of adult Americans has risen to 10.8 years ( and will be 12.2 by 1965 ) . Against 95,000 graduates in 1900 , U.S. high schools this year produced 1,500,000 , and half of them are going to college . And out of public schools in every corner of the land have marched armies of the nation 's future leaders . <P> The size of the enterprise is staggering .
