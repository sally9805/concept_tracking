Tic great disparity between the fame of Gerrude Stein as one of the giants of modern literature and the inconsequential number of her published works made up a paradox that outraged her sense of justice and subdued her hopes for lasting consideration through all of the early and middle years of her professional life . Popular reviewers kept her name prominent in the columns of American newspapers , and sometimes even spoke of her with respect instead of quoting her sentences for easy laughs . She seas talked about , listened to , made into a legend . But for many reasons she was not read , and the most important of these was simply that she was not published . Her despair at this neglect brought her at times to a poignancy of expression which normally would he the last thing one might expect from her . " Sometimes I think it would be Mee , " she said , " to sell typewritten copies of me in a store but I do n't know of a store . " While her manuscripts were always readily available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long waited failed to show . Carefully bound , the completed works of more than twenty creative years stood in proud isolation upon the shelves of a Spanish arnmire . Meantime , Ger-trude and her friends made plans , cooked up schemes , and tried angles , enlisting aid from any quarter that might lead to the ransom and rescue of the well-dusted but king-neglected manuscripts . In 1920 , John Lane had reprinted Three Lives in England , and in modest second-round success had whetted Gertrude 's appetite for more . From New York a friend sent advice that echoed the feelings of a hard core of devotees and a few critics : " Last spring I dined with Walter Arens-berg &; Duchamp and we talked of a new book of your things and the best way to put it over etc My opinion was that you ought en print it privately at your own expense and once a thousand volumes were printed they could be said somehow . I think in the end it would pay for itself . You see you are handicapped by writing in a language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mu , for you but no publisher . " When Robert MeAlmon , the young director of Contact Editions and husband of the wealthy English writer Bryher , came within striking distance , Gertrude issued an invitation to tea . But them ccasion MRS only partly social ; Gertrude had business in mind . During the course of talk she suggested that McAlmon publish The Making of Americans in a series of four to six volumes over a period of two years . He responded to the notion that her book might be suitable on the list of his Contact Editions but felt that since the work was all of a piece and offered no obvious divisions for serial presentation , it had better be published as a single volume . Gertrude quickly sanctioned this improvement on her own scheme and promised McAlmon that she would see to it that at least fifty friends bought advance copies . The manuscript was shortly on its way to the press of Maurice Darantiere in Dijon , a firm which had already served the cause of modernism by printing James Joyce 's Ulysses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nightmare for the French compositors . Countless repetitions , minute inversions , infinitesimal variations , all the characteristic tricks and turns of the early Stein were quite beyond them . When proofs came back , Gertrude and her companion , Alice Toklas , were faced with a job that brought them to the edge of despair and blindness . Rereading the book for the first time since she had written it , Gertrude found the experience a mixed pleasure . She was greatly worried that people might think some of the hook 's unorthodox use of tenses , persons , adjectives , and divisions was not to be taken as written but that they would he ascribed to the whimseys of typesetters . " Though it does seem a bit profound to my twenty year older eyes , " site admitted , she was on the whole eminently satisfied with the literary merit of the manuscript as it stood . She toyed with the idea of making certain minor revisions but always found herself reverting to the original way of putting things . In her personal judgment , the long-buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are some pretty wonderful sentences in it , " she wrote to Sherwood Anderson , " and we know how fond we both are of sentences . " The Making of Americans , more than nine hum deed literally transparent and almost unreadable pages , paper-bound , was published finally its September , 1925 , but not before Gertrude 's forwardness had cost her the friendship of the man who published it . In McAlmon 's absence from France she had taken it upon herself , against his instructions , to order delivery of the printed volumes from M. Daranti2re for immediate shipment to New York . When McAlmon discovered this unwarranted intervention , he was angry ? not without reason , Gertrude conceded ? and wrote to her detailing other matters Ile regarded as breaches of their understanding . He felt that Gertrude had done nothing herself to promote distribution of the book , noting that " no evidence of any order has come in through your offices except from your immediate family . " He concluded his letter with accusations and a threat : " Incidentally , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pub ! if your net is of prime hnportance for you you wish the books retained , you may bid f them . Otherwise , by September ? one year aft publication ? I shall simply rid myself of the en- masse , by the pulping proposition . " McAltnon 's threat was never carried out , b his personal relations with her had come to an en Friendship or no , The Making of Americans , tl cornerstone ina er dedicated to unorthodox on the largest scale care ever entertained by a serio writer , was at last available to anyone who cart to buy . In the wide net of literary , romantic , or ha stool relationships that self-exiled Americans ar Englishmen had cast over artist-quarter Paris at its Spanish , Italian , and Riviera suburbs , Robe McAlmon was a ubiquitous figure . His no work as a writer came to nothing much , but I. services as the publisher of Contact Editions as the Three Mountains Press were of cnormo value . Besides Gertrude Stein , authors who work he brought out in editions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hemingway , Ezra Pound , William Carlos Wi Earns , H , D. , Djuna Barnes , and the paint Marsden Hartley , whose Twenty-fire Poems a ; peared its 1923 . Although the expatriate perk tends , today , to be notable mainly for the gee fame of a very few writers and painters , it was period that beautifully accommodated scores marginal artists like McAlmon and hundreds brilliant failures whose ambitions could be kel alive in vicarious enjoyment of the success those who had come through . A.Litnuall Gertrude 's literary success was sti but thinly substantiated by published works , ht social success as a leading figure in the expatria , world was radiant and beyond question . " 0 any mornings , " recalled the social-historia Lloyd Morris , " when the streets of the Rigl Bank were full of people , a hallucination wool sometimes overtake you . From around a corm there appeared the vision of a great Buddha o wheels , erratically charging clown the thorougl fare , divinely indifferent to the fate of more traffic , heedless of laughter or imprecations .

Stein was massive , monumental , majestic ; she ha the grandeur of a major scenic phenomenon . . A summons to her home was an invitation I present oneself to Most Blanc . " ' Through the early and middle twenties , No. 27 Nue de Fleurus had assumed the aspect of some-thing between a court and a shrine . Proximity to the throne , where Gertrude sat with legs crossed , one sandal dangling from her big toe , was touch to be desired by the young men who curried royal favor . There was , in the course of dote , always one among who , unofficially yet with au-thority- , served as major-domo to the royal establishment , while all about him jockeyings for position went on . In the background , over the noise of the teacups , one could hear the sound of rolling heads , the nimble of dead reputations being carted away . Not the least noticeable thing about the salon was the way its dramatis personae changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gertrude and Alice preferred variety in their relationships , and Alice often blithely quoted the jingle , " Give tine new faces , new faces , new faces . I have seen the out Ones . " Gertrude had said for years that she liked to tee people come but , just as much , the liked to see then , go . As a shrine , the atelier was already historical : Hal impressively decked with propitiatory gifts . A patina of fume had settled on the paintings , and the brushings of thousands of pilgrims laud mellowed and polished the heavy furniture . ' Those who did not know and perhaps would not have cared about the ne hierarchical divisions in Gcrtrudc 's retinue catneic to her door as sober and interested as they would come to Sainte Chapelle or Les Inv:dick , . In search of " all sluff Paris had to offer , " they regarded a visit to " 27 " as a visit to an : teadettly where examples of almost every phase of modern painting could be studied at leisure and discussed with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social climate , the paintings re-mained the focal point of interest around which tine deeper life of the salon revolved . Gertrude was continually rearranging the works , featuring new ones , or attempting to revive interest in a said one by pplacingin at position of prominence . She also had her own salon des menses , a small room into which were dispatched paintings she had acquired as white-elephant gills , or had bought by mistake , or in which she had finally lost interest . " I never know when or why a picture suddenly becomes beautiful and loses its quality of irritation , " she said . " There was a time when I had to cover that Ozanne portrait with a glass for no one would believe that it was finished ; it irritated everyone and even angered sonic . Without liking it , I had recognized its quality , and then one day as one turns over in steep ? it became beautiful and I could not see it in the way I had leen it before . " Because of this lively changing attitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salon , which so easily might have taken on the dead air of a museum . While her great collection of paintings gave Gertrude 's salon a specific luster , a number of people , painters among them , felt that she actually knew little about painting and that her taste was , at best , whimsical , Even an intimate like the painter Harry Phelan Gibb , her closest 1Snglish friend , was disturbed on one occasion by a most unexpected reaction from Gertrude . Gibb had scot her one of his works , on the back of which was a sketch of the sort he turned out for calendars and greeting cards as a way of making a living . To his astonishment , Gertrude altogether dismissed the gift painting but said she thought the sketch was very fine . Gibb wrote : " I do n't know what to make of it . The sketch you give praise to was one of illy worst pot-boilers too bad to sell at any price . I therefore used the back and painted the other one . I thought it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together yet I thought I had got just that something out of the commonplace . Then I thought it might amuse you . It never occurred to use you would look at the one on the back . However you have looked at it . You have said what you think and I am left perplexed . " Since both she and her brother had made so much of their pictures ? he in his salon lectures and later in his writings , site in her literary transcriptions of cubism ? many observers came to regard them mainly as theorists , lacking in any real feeling for visual art , whose pictures were Theirpegs on which they could hang hypotheses . Their critics , granting that the Steins had taken up Picasso and Matisse in the very earliest days of their collection , pointed to their later divergent interests , which led Leo away from nearly all contact with modern art and led Gertrude to give support to artists whose lack of talent was an open scandal . In this view , their connection with Picasso and Matisse seemed a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost any other association might have served as well . Many people felt that , even as she sat as pro-prietor in the midst of her collection , Gertrude could not wholly disguise the fact that she was more interested in the individuals who had contributed works to it than she was in the paintings themselves . Her concern , they believed , was with personalities and public success rattler than with actual achievement . They noticed often that she tended to rate aIleW painter 's promise in terms of his resistance to her . An indifferent newcomer was net with indifference , and when Inc was shown to the door his work was banished with him . Throughout her life , Gertrude showed very little interest in the work of artists she did not know , unless they were dead and comfortably separated from her by at least a generation . There was no distant idol in her life at any time , no one beyond her immediate circle toward whom she looked with respect and admiration , unless it were someone as remote from the world of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to be satisfied with self-adulation , knowing , as she said , that in her time she was the only one . Her affection for others was reserved for those whom she could appropriate . Whether or not the world agreed , Picasso was the only painter , Sherwood Anderson was the great American writer , and Virgil Thomson was the greatest living master of prosody . Yet Gertrude 's prestige as an arbiter of painting was not to be dismissed . Her early identification with the career of Picasso had given her the aura of a prophetess , which , in a business way , some dealers Wen eager to exploit , and her appearance at the opening of a new exhibition was considered the first augury of its success . Her entrance was awaited always , and was unfailingly dramatic ; she kept up a running stream of chatter as she moved at will through the gallery and was never without an audience . Holding forth in the center of a hundred paintings , she blessed this work with her popish hands and damned that with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent her a questionnaire in which was the question , " What is your attitude toward art today ? " Gertrude dismissed all pretension . " I like to look at it " was her whole austere . IN HER OWII preserve , perpetually attended by her dark guardian angel with the long earrings , her apparent remoteness caused many people to feel that they might at any moment catch fire from the sacred flame . Something timeless about her seas alternately repellent and attractive . Most of the visitors succumbed to her charm , and any who remained inarticulate about her work easily found words to describe her fascination . When William Carlos Williams , the American poet and physician , came with Robert McAlmon to see her , she gave him tea , then one by one showed him her great collection of unpublished works and asked him what he would do if he were in a similar position . " ft most have been that I was in one of my more candid moods , " Dr. Williams wrote in his Autobiograpky , " or that the cynical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stein 's work seas uppermost in my mind , for my reply was , ' If they were mine , having to many , I would probably select what I thought were the best and throw the rest into the fire . ' " There was a shocked silence . Then , as Mc-Almon recalled , Gertrude became vehement . " No , oh no , no , no , " she said , " that is n't possible . You would not find a painter destroying any of his sketches . A writer 's writing is too much of the writer 's being ; his flesh child . You may , but of course , writing is not your metier , Doctor . " " But Doctor Stein , " said Williams , " are you sure that writing is your metier ? I solve the economies of life through the profession of doctoring , but from the first my will was toward writing . I hope it pleases you , but things that children write have seemed to me so Gertrude Steinish in their repetitions . Your quality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . " This was too much ; the door of the atelier had already closed silently on William Carlos Williams . " I could not see him after that , " Gertrude said . " I told the maid I was not in if he came again . There is too much bombast in him . " But the contretemps did not change Dr. Williams ' deep appreciation of what Gertrude Stein was doing in the way of pioneering new American paths into the overgrown forests of a literature moldy with imitative leaves from the pages of Spenser and Wordsworth and Tennyson . " Having taken the words of her choice , " he scenic , " to emphasize further what she has in mind she has completely unlinked them from their former relationships to the sentence . This was absolutely essential and inescapable . Each under the new arrangement has a quality of its own , but not conjoined to carry the burden of science , philosophy , and every higgledy-piggledy figment law and order have been laying upon them in the past . They are like a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airplane . . . . She has placed writing on a plane where it may deal unhampered with its own affairs , unburdened with scientific and philosophic lumber . " In her own mind , Gertrude was boils the Parisian figure and the foursquare American that she I 've to be . " For one thing , for all of the time I 've been in France , " she said , " I have never been called an expatriate and that is the thing I am proud of . I proved you could be a good American anywhere in the world . " Subterranean currents might be coursing through an evening 's assemblage of personalities , but the overall tone of the salon was one of a strict and formal politeness . Gertrude would seldom tolerate eccentric behavior in anyone but herself and was quick to cut those whose manner was odd , or presumptuous , or snide . But boorishness was never the only reason for a snub . Dullness and conventionality were just as vulnerable . Site preferred , by all odds , the interesting fake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at " 27 " included figures of every conceivable artistic type and temperamental persuasion except plodding earnestness . KATHERINE ANNE Portann , then living in Paris , was harsh in assessing the pretensions of the salon and its fledglings . " Miss Stein herself sat there in full possession of herself , the scene , the spectators , " wrote Miss Porter in The Days Before , " . . wearing thick no-colored shapeless woo/en clothes and honest woolen stockings knitted for her by Miss Tobias , looking extremely like a handsome old . jewislt patriarch who had backslid and shaved olT his beard . " Among the late-comers trying to elbow their way into the lost generation were some W110 , according to Miss Porter , " announced that they wished their writings to be as Gee from , literature as if they had never read a book , as indeed loo many of them had not up to the time . . . . A few of thorn were really lost , and disappeared , but others had just painted themselves into a very crowded corner . " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view her coterie attachments in quite a dillerent light . " Shewas supposed to exert a deleterious inlitielle , on the young , " wrote Harold Acton , " but es far as 1 could see she solved their problems with rare sympathy and common sense . I considered her a excellent critic . To ille she gave sound advice , n though I was neither a disciple or an imitator . I showed her my latest poems and , . . a fable in prose Windt I had just finished , and she saw in them what she was looking far : the rhythmical connexion between my writings and my personality . " The regulars cherished their sense of coterie , yet the group was COntintially riddled with dissension . ' To have paid respects to Gertrude and to have sat with Alice were to have been admitted into the charmed circle of thmc whose pretenses , at least , were interesting and fashionable and to have received the benediction which , a short time past , had been famously granted to l'icasso and Matisse , to Anderson and Hemingway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He did not at once get along very well with Alice , but he found himself in Gertrude 's goad grace simply for having chain to put certain of her works to music . Thomson had for years been one of her admirers , and his understanding of what she was up to was based on firsthand knowledge of her writing . But he was no sycophant , and his objective sense of Gertrude 's personality was as clear as the a/Medan in which he held het for many years . " She expected to be granted the freedom of a man , " he observed , " without allowing anyone to sacrifice the respect due her as a woman . " Whereas there was nearly always some elusive note of patronizing in Gertrude 's clucking attendance upon her mixed brood , this did not extend to Virgil Thomson . She seemed to have recognized his brilliance as a critic and his self-assurance as a composer from the very beginning of their relationship and to have accepted him as an equal . While ' 1 ' . S. Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limited reputation , his stature was already outlined clearly enough to indicate the great range of his ultimate influence . Within the walls of " 27 , " his name had first been mentioned by Ezra Pound . Through a mutual friend of Gertrude 's and E/iot 's , Lady Rothermere , who was financing the publication of the Criterion , which was edited by the poet , an evening was arranged at which Miss Stein and Mr. Eliot were to become acquainted . Gertrude pro- fessed to be but halfhearted in the prospect , but Alice and others told these that this was one young man site should not miss , knowing . Alice wan put- ting finishing touches on a new evening dress that Gertrude was going to wear for the occasion when , unexpectedly , Lady Rothermere and Eliot , along with Jane Heap , the editor of the Little Review , arrived at the Rue de Pleuras . Alice remembered Eliot as " a sober , almost solemn , not so young man who , refusing to give up his umbrella , sat clasping its handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1Vith Gertrude he had a sober conversation about split infinitives and other grammatical solecisms , and her knack of bringing them into her work . Eliot suggested that he would be pleased to have her give him something for publication in an early Sorted of the Criterion . But , be insisted , what he wanted was her very latest thing . As soon as he and his companions had departed , Gertrude sat down and wrote a portrait of Eliot which , since his visit had been made on November 15 , she entitled " The Fifteenth of November . " Eliot accepted this piece but , in spite of his insistence on the freshness of what he might publish , its appearance was repeatedly delayed for nearly two years . The Eliot portrait was merely one in a series of such works in a now familiar method . However , since it was published in an organ as highly regarded as the Criterion , the portrait served to buttress Gertrude 's rapidly solidifying reputation as undermines of traditions and menace to the academies . The pen of Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of established literature , in the center of which , like an ivy-covered Kremlin , stood Harvard University . " If this is literature , " wrote Canby , " or anything other than stupidity worse than madness , then has all criticism since the beginning of letters been mere idle theorizing . If it is literature , then alas ! for literature . Thank Heaven , that there arc still Professor Lowes and Harvards to conserve tradition and guide taste , and to make the world unsafe for eccentricity . To raise the grotesque and the absurd to the plane of the serious is to render a disservice to literature . More , it is to render an insult to intelligence and evoke a curse on criticism . " Gertrude professed to be pleased when , some time later , she heard that Eliot had said in a lecture at Cambridge that her work was " very fine but not for us . " What Eliot actually said was " it is not improving , it is not amusing , it is not interesting , it is not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar hypnotic power not met with before . It has a kinship with the saxophone . If this is the future , then the future is , as it very likely is , of the barbarians . But this is the future in which we ought not to be interested . " While deploring her influence , Eliot nevertheless granted the effectiveness of some of her methods and admitted in a letter to her that he was " immensely interested " in everything she wrote . According to Bravig Imbs , a young novelist fresh from Dartmouth College who served a short term as major-domo , " we were a coterie and most of as young enough to think it very important . We were all going to be great artists and we had all sat with Alice and we had all given our homage to Gertrude . " With an many personalities , Gertrude 's favorite sport , so Imbs said , was the deliberate framing of contretemps , which were apt to result in emotional fireworks . This Machiavellian game took place while she sat " majestically like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but mortal combat she had encouraged among her guests . She was not only ex-treme ! ) , versed in the French art of brouille but had this extra accomplishment of stirring up quarrels between people without ever once stepping into the shadow of blame herself . . . . Alice would always reprove Gertrude for letting herself fall into such temptations , and Gertrude would answer with Juan Geis ' favorite proverb : One must always yield to temptation . " Tfic friendship of Gertrude Stein and Edith Sitwell , which in time became a firm one , began inauspiciously . In 1923 , Miss Sitwell had pub-fished in the Nation and Athenaeum a review of Geography and Plays , in which she said " To sum up the book as far as possible , I had in it an almost insuperable amount of silliness , an irritating cease- less ratite like that of American sightseers talking in a boarding-house ( this being , I imagine , a deliberate effect ) , great bravery , a certain real originality , and a few flashes of exquisite beauty . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gertrude felt that the review was condescending and dis-missed it as but another report from the alien world . A year later , the London Vogue published an article by Miss Sitwell in which she stated that she had spent the year reading almost nothing but Geography and Plays and that she considered it important and beautiful book . Gertrude forgave and forgot . When Edith Sitwell next came to Paris , ameeting was arranged , and one at Ger-trude 's few friendships with anyone she might have considered a peer scat affectionately joined . In later years , Edith Sitwell and her brother Osbert remembered Gertrude mainly for her incorrigible tendency to misinterpret every human relationship with which she came into contact . When Gertrude said that So-and-so was in love with So-and-so but that the emotion was n-requited , or that Mme. X was about to sue M.u Y for slander in a matter involving Mlle. Z , the Sitwells came to the conclusion that they would approach the truth only by assuming just the opposite of Gertrude 's assertions . But their fond-MSS for her as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long-standing . " She is the last writer in the world whom any other writer should take as a model , " Dame Edith wrote , " but her work , for the most part , is very valuable because of its revivifying qualities , and it contains , to my mind , considerable beauty . " Reporting one of their early conversations , she ccalled that of had said , " The difference between Picasso and inferior painters is that inferior painters put in all the leaves on a tree , with the result that you see neither tree nor leaves . Picasso paints one leaf upon a tree , and you see the life of the tree . " In a similar sense , commented Dame Edith , " She throws is word into the air , and when it returns to the ground it bears within it the original meaning it bore before custom and misuse had blurred it . " When Miss Sitwell returned to England , it was upon her urging that Gertrude consented to lecture at Cambridge . When the president of the literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early spring of 1926 , the idea terrified her . She wrote a quick and definite refusal . Hearing of this rejection , Edith Sitwell wrote immediately to say that it was of the first importance that she change her mind , that Gertrude 's " actual presence in England would help the cause " since " it is quite undoubted that a personality does help to convince half-intelligent people . " Contingent upon Gertrude 's acceptance of the Cambridge invitation , Miss Sitwell prodded , Oxford was also about to ask her to lecture . Gertrude did change her mind , but the prospect of a public appearance sent her into an extended period of anxiety . She brooded for days , decided to take elocution lessons from a professor at the Sorbonne , then decided not to . She could make no beginning on what she was going to say until one afternoon in Montrougc when , waiting for a mechanic to finish repairs on her car , she sat on the fender of another ear in the garage and began to write . By the time her Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evplanation . To make sure that she would be stylishly caparisoned , her friend Yvonne Davidson provided her with a stately robe of blue Chinese brocade . The next step was to get the reaction of anyone who might be willing to listen to a preview performance of her lecture . Everyone had ideas ? not on much on the content of the lecture , since no one ever argued with Gertrude about the validity of her thoughts ? but on the manner of delivery . After much confusing advice , and with no belief that she had learned anything , she arrived in London in the grip of a fearful ease of stage fright . Osbert Sitwell , who , she flt , looked like " the uncle of a king , " came to her hotel , extended his sympathy , and tried to help . " He so thoroughly understood every possible way in which one could be nervous , " said Gertrude , that she was " quite soothed . " Tx evening at Cambridge was a resonant suc-cess , and when , at OxIbril a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robe of Chinese blue , she had begun to feel like a prima donna . Harold Act. , who had invited her to address the members and friends of the Ordinary , a literary society , recalls the event in his Memoirs of an Aesthete : " Edith , Osbert and Sacheverell Sitwell accompanied Gertrude as well as Miss Alice Toklas , her inseparable companion , who looked like a Spanish gipsy and talked like a Bostonian . Gertrude had left all her nervousness at Cam-bridge ; it was a fine summer clay and she was ready to enjoy herself . Hcr audience was even larger than I had anticipated and many had to stand . Owing to the critics , the popular conception of Gertrude Stein was of an eccentric visionary , a literary Madame Blavatsky its fabulous clothes , the triumph of the dream and escape from life personified , . with hells on her lingers as well as on her toes , or a mermaid swathed in tinsel , smoking drugged cigarettes through an exaggerated cigarette holder , or a Gioconda who had had her face lifted no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmares of Leonardo da Vinci . Onewas aware of the rapid deflation of these conceptions , as Gertrude surpassed them by her appearance , a squat Aztec figure in obsidian , growing more monumental as soon as she sat down . Wills her tall bodyguard of Sitwells and the gipsy acolyte , she made a memorable entry . " Nobody was prepared for what followed , a placid reading of Composition as Explanation and several word portraits , including one of Edith Sitwell , who sat in near that the portrait could be compared with the original .. . . Though we had heard dozens of lector. , nobody had heard anything like this before . There was no nonsense alsout her manner , which was in deep American earnest , as natural as could be . . . While she read Edith Sitwell 's portrait I glanced at the mode/ . No , I could not see the likeness , nor , apparently , could Edith , for she was trying not to look as embarrassed as she felt .

Gertrude Stein was casting a spell with her litany which might go on for ever and ever amen . " Discussion after her talk lasted for an hour . When so asked her why she thought she meone was on the right track with her unique sort of work , slse replied that it was not a question of what she thought or of what anyone thought . She had been going her own way for twenty years , and now at both Oxford and Cambridge they wanted to hear her lecture . The climax of the evening came with a touch of Gertrude 's wit that left nothing more to be said . In his memoirs , Osbert Sitwell recalls the moment : " I remember . . . a certain commotionarising and some accompanying laughter when .. she remarked Everything is the same and everything is different . ' " Many undergraduates had come to the hall to arose themselves after the lecture at the expense of a writer snidely and angrily derided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But in the presence of this obviously distinguished woman , the wiser of them recognized that there was not much to be done in this line . At the end , two young gentlemen , not so easily discouraged , shot up to heckle her from different parts of the audience : but they asked an identical question : ' Miss Stein , if everything is the same , how can everything be different ? ' In a most genial , comforting manner , Miss Stein replied : ' Well , just look at you two dear boys ! ' "
