txt The Eisenhower Administration overcame the " invincibility " of the farm bloc today as the House of Representatives adopted a flexible system of supporting farm prices . A roll-call vote of 228 to 170 gave President Eisenhower one of his most sweeping legislative victories . The President not only succeeded in chipping segments of the farm bloc away from high , rigid price props but also drew strong support from some bigcity Democrats , who were concerned with high food costs to consumers . After the crucial vote on the program , offered as a compromise by the Administration itself , the House shouted approval of the " single package " farm bill . High Federal subsidies on five crops were eliminated by the rollcall vote ; these crops are cotton , corn , wheat , peanuts and rice . The flexible system calls for supports on the five crops ranging from 82% to 90 per cent of parity prices , depending upon supply and demand . This was adopted after the Administration had retreated from a flexible system of 75 to 90 per cent of parity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 per cent of parity  --  parity being a level calculated to be fair to farmers in relation to their costs . This rigid support , the Administration contended , has been a major cause of the huge food surpluses building up in Federal storage . The measure now goes to the Senate . - House leaders , Including Democrats , foresaw early approval there on the - Administration 's compromise . If : adopted by the Senate , the flexible system would become . effective Jan. 1 . . The Senate Agriculture Committee has voted , 8 ; to 7 , for a one-year continuation of rigid supports . The House Agriculture Committee had voted for high supports , 22 to 8 . In the compromise ,  --  the Presitent retreated from his original position calling for supports at 75 to 90 per cent ' . of - parity . The House turned down such a range yesterday with support from Administration leaders . The major idea in ? the President 's mind in compomising , however , was to get a farm , program " moving in the right directionU ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesmen told the House . Voting for the flexible system today were 182 Republicans , forty-five Democrats and one Independent ; against it were twentythree Republicans and 147 Democrats . Overnight , the Administration picked up more than twenty Democratic Votes while garnering about three more G. O. P. ballots . Many Republican farm leaders had warned that the party would lose control of Congress on flexible supports and lower farm prices in an Congressional election year . President Eisenhower maintained that he thought it was good politic. , to do what was good for the country . Representative Clifford R. Hope , Kansas Republican and leader of the high-supports forces , said the defeat for this group was caused by the defection of wool and dairy segments of the farm states . He is chairman of the House Agriculture Committee . He declined to estimate the political impact of the House decision on his party 's chances in the November election . Representative Sam Rayburn , Texas ' Democrat and former House Speaker , likewise declined to make a political prediction , but said " it will be hard  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Secretary of Agriculture , True D. Morse , hailed the House action as " encouraging " and as a ' move toward full flexibility in the Federal price-support program . He spoke in the absence from Washington of the Secretary of Agriculture , Ezra Taft Benson , who has pushed the Administration 's position from its start . A major share of the credit for the Administration 's victory went to Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts and Representative Charles A. Halleek of Indiana , the Floor Leader . They put the Republican side into line after early fears that the big-city Democrats would " gang up " on them . In addition to the flexible price-support system , other major features of the farm bill in-clude : ( IThe Administration 's recommendation that a modernized parity formula for computing support levels be started in 1956 . However , any drops in the support levels would be limited to 5 per cent each year during a transition period to cushion the economic jolts . ( IThe Administration 's plan for setting aside *2,500,000,000 worth of farm surpluses  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cotton and possibly 400,000,000 bushels of corn ? to be used for a national stockpile and foreign and domestic aid . These surpluses , now in Federal hands , would not be counted in calculating price-support levels . CArise in dairy supports from 75 per cent to 80 per cent of parity , effective Sept. 1 and running to April 1 , 1955 . This sectior , though , also provides direct subsidies to dairy farmers and processors to encourage the disposal of surpluses . Secretary Benson had cut the support to 75 per cent last April 1 after big dairy supplies had piled up under a 90 per cent level  --  with the Government buying any products not going into the market . ( IA provision for a wheat referendum next year . Farmers will vote en whether they prefer rigid supports with acreage controls or a two-price system . Under the latter , domestic consumption of wheat would be stipported but grain for export would move into trade at , the competitive world prices . ( IA direct subsidy program for wool . To encourage production , wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market at competitive prices . The House amended this Administrationbacked program by setting 110 per cent of parity as the limit of the Government 's support . A similar wool bill already has passed the Senate . ' Representative Jacob K. Javits ; Manhattan Republican , pleaded with the House to keep the dairy support at 75 per cent . But the House defeated his amendment on a standing vote fo 102 to 39 . Representative Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. , Manhattan Democrat , supported an increase in dairy supports . He also sought unsuccessfully tohave considered an amendment to compel the Government to divert $100,000 , - ' 000 from subsidy operations to increasing the consumption of fluid milk and other dairy products in the Armed Forces . He also lost on a standing vote of 105 to 93 on a request that the Secretary of Agriculture investigate the spread in milk prices so New York City residents " would know why they are spending three times as much as the farmers get for milk .
