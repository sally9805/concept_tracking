Mister Johnson ( adapted from Joyce Gary 's novel by Norman Rosten ) is a young West African Negro who has become a British government clerk and yearns to be a full-fledged , " civilized , " Christian Briton . But , even in his bumbling and his guile , the sunny-natured , light-fingered , childlike clerk is miles from his models . An orphan of two cultures , he carries a furled umbrella while walking barefoot , with his patent leather pumps hanging about his neck . <P> To be sure , in the thorny matter of getting a road built , it is Mister Johnson who finds the answer-but in so un-British a fashion as to get sacked . Then , in a moment of drunken confusion , he inadvertently kills a storekeeper he is trying to rob , and mercy can find no legal way to season justice . <P> Happy-Go-Unlucky . For more than half the evening Mister Johnson rather recalls The Teahouse of the August Moon , perhaps because Robert Lewis ably directed both plays . There is a like comedy of nationalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a needed road is stalled in red tape , in the other it is a needed schoolhouse ; in one , an engaging young native sage holds forth , in the other it is an engaging young native duffer . But the difference between the two plays ' titles helps explain their enormous eventual difference in tone . Mister Johnson is really , from beginning to end , the portrait of a happy-go-unlucky man , the saga of a culturally displaced person . A comedy of miscomprehension that explodes into sudden tragedy , it is all the sadder for involving no villains , no clash of good and evil , or even of conscious right and wrong . <P> In the play , Mister Johnson 's death has not quite enough of Mister Johnson 's life behind it , and seems , though genuinely moving , a little bit wheeled into place . Yet the play 's great and steady virtue is that Mister Johnson is always flesh and blood and not just a personalized symbol . It is also a great virtue of the production that Earle Hyman plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Mister Johnson 's heartsick British judge and executioner , William Sylvester plays well too , and William and Jean Eckart have evocatively mounted the play . <P> Displaced Narrative . In portraying its altogether central figure , the play resorts , as perhaps it must , to peculiarly centrifugal stagecraft . There are too many episodes that , if vivid , are sketchy , hurried , discontinuous , that seem flashes of ethnic scenery rather than stretches of dramatic mileage . Mister Johnson not only concerns a man who can not keep to the road ; it unfolds its story with almost no road to keep to . It comes off a kind of displaced narrative : as Mister Johnson emerges neither native nor British , Mister Johnson emerges neither novel nor play . But if too fragmented and saltatory , it yields up a memorable human being .
