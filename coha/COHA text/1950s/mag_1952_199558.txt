Five German states , whose names are encrusted with centuries of history , formally disappeared last week . <P> East Germany 's Communist government decided to dissolve these provinces : Brandenburg , once the domain of the Margrave of Brandenburg for whom Johann Sebastian Bach composed his six famous concertos : Saxony , birthplace of Otto the Great , founder of the Holy Roman Empire ; Mecklenburg , once obedient to the Duke of Saxony ; Saxony-Anhalt , which produced Martin Luther and George Frederick Handel ; Thuringia , a center of Luther 's Reformation . <P> The Communists hoped to squeeze satellite Germany tight into a straitjacket stamped with the words " democratic centralism . " The five historic states were replaced by 14 administrative districts . After the East German " People 's Chamber " in Berlin obediently ratified the plan , the parliaments of the five provinces solemnly voted themselves out of existence . <P> Then the Communists tightened the laces in the straitjacket . In each new district , buildings were requisitioned for military and secret police headquarters . The Soviet-sponsored newspaper Taegliche Rundschau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany 's Izvestia . The East German SED ( Communist ) Party paper Neues Deutschland became its Pravda . Strict loyalty checks got under way among staffs of both newspapers . <P> With these moves the Russians hastened the conversion of their East German satellite into a European North Korea .
