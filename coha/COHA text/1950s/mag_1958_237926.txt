For thousands of U.S. car buyers , the secret best kept by dealers is the list price suggested by Detroit . The reason is " price packing , " the skilled and corrupt art by which some dealers boost the cost of accessories-from map lights to automatic transmissions-until the car 's price is several hundred dollars over list . The dealer then generously offers a hefty " discount , " or an inflated trade-in price , giving the customer the illusion that the deal is fantastically good . Last week in Washington , the Justice Department opened an investigation of price packing aimed at indictments under the Sherman Antitrust Act . <P> A federal grand jury began checking into the books of the capital 's Ford , Chevrolet and Chrysler dealers ' associations ; the Justice Department is investigating others throughout the nation . While packing is not illegal when performed by individual dealers , the jury will investigate complaints of dealer associations ' price fixing , which is against the law . The Government suspects that dealers who sell one line are forming area associations to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By agreeing on the size of the pack , they eliminate competition among themselves . <P> Another attack on such chiseling by " a few unscrupulous dealers " is being led by Oklahoma 's Democratic Senator Mike Monroney . He has sponsored a bill requiring that every new car in a showroom be clearly labeled with the maker 's list price . Some Detroit carmakers are privately in favor of the bill as a way of regaining customer trust . <P> The National Automobile Dealers Association is also in favor of the Monroney bill . In addition , it wants carmakers to set a national list price-and disenfranchise dealers who ignore it-instead of the present practice of different list prices in different areas . But carmakers are not yet ready to go that far . Says retired Rear Admiral Frederick Bell , executive vice president of N.A.D.A. : " We think the Monroney bill is a step in the right direction of taking the razzle-dazzle and hocus-pocus out of auto pricing .
