By unsegregated plane and Pullman , in segregated buses and in Jim Crow railroad coaches , delegates of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People descended on Atlanta , capital of the Deep South . They met in the Deep South for the first time since an earlier convention in Atlanta in 1920 . Thirty-one years had made startling changes in both the N.A.A.C.P. and Atlanta . <P> Unlike the earlier convention , which had met quietly in a small church in the city 's Negro district , most of last week 's sessions were held in the city 's marble-front municipal auditorium . The 781 delegates and their wives were officially welcomed by Mayor William B. Hartsfield , who showed a spirit rare in Southern officeholders by greeting them as " distinguished guests , ladies &; gentlemen . " <P> No Trouble . The 1920 convention had taken a defensive stand by deploring lynchings ( 65 that year , against 2 in 1950 ) and pleading for more civil rights . Last week such speakers as Author Lillian Smith , Dr. Ralph Bunche and N.A.A.C.P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hammered away at the convention 's main theme : End Segregation Now ! They had met in Atlanta to dramatize their fight against segregation , but , unlike Communist groups , did not defy it in practice just to stir up trouble .

One bus driver , who seemed more confused than indignant when two girl delegates , one white and one colored , entered his bus and sat together , called for a cop . After the policeman spotted the convention badges worn by the girls , he instructed the driver to go ahead and say nothing . The city 's segregation ordinance was also quietly set aside so that delegates could hold a dance at a local dance hall . <P> Police Escort . Atlanta 's largest nonsegregated audience since Reconstruction days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prizewinner Bunche , which closed the six-day convention . He lashed the Senate for failing to pass Civil Rights legislation , said bluntly : " I can never be fully relaxed in Atlanta , fine city that it is ... since I abhorracial prejudice and its evil end products , discrimination and segregation . I can find more than enough of that far to the north . . . Among those heroic men fighting for the freedom of all of us in Korea are many American Negroes . But not one of these Negro heroes , even if he wore the Medal of Honor , could rent a hotel room in Atlanta . Yet any non-Negro , even if he were a deserter , a traitor or a Communist conspirator , could do so ... Equality is all the Negro citizen demands , and I am positive that the Negro will never give up this struggle until he achieves it . . . " After Dr. Bunche 's speech , a white police escort rushed him to the airport . It was the first time in Atlanta 's history that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
