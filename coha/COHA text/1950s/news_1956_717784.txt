txt Long-range bombers have not been outdated by missiles guided electronically to their targets , Donald A. Quarles , Secretary of the Air Force , said today . Mr. Quarles , concerned that public impressions of the weapons picture are ' completely out of perspective . " gave assurances of United States alertness in a talk before the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce . He said the United States is giving " top priority " to development of an intercontinental ballistic missile . However , added , both the United States and the Soviets have bombers capable of outperforming present missiles . Conventional bombers , said , can do " a better job of strategic delivery for sonic time to come than anybody can hope to do with ballistic missiles . " Quick Retaliation The Air Secretary said that nobody , including the Soviet Union , is " going to start a war because they have this kind of weapon unless they can sec a way to avoid destruction them-:elves . " He added that the United States presently has and will continue to have the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with such devastation to the aggressors that by no stretch of the imagination could they expect to improve their situation by launching the attack . " Mr. Quarles had told a New York audience last night that the Soviets have " the most numerous armed force in the world . " He described Soviet air-atomic progress as . posing a serious threat to current United States leadership in these fields . He said the Soviet . Union has roughly the same number of engineers and natural scientists as the United States , and is producing others at a much faster rate . Precision Bombing " They have developed and will soon have substantial numbers of long-range jet bombers capable of delivering atomic weapons on the United States , " he said . The Soviets already have enough light and medium bombers with sufficient range to hit United States bases overseas , Mr. Quarles stated . With these bombers the Soviets can deliver atomic bombs " with more precision than we expect them to achieve with a ballistic missile for a long time to come . " The United States also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of A-bombs " for some time to come , " he added . As for missile development , he said , the United States is working not only on intercontinental missiles but also on " air-breathing guided missiles " that will he at least equal to the ballistic missile , if not better . in range , accurac , y , and load-carrying capacity . Mr Quarles explained that ballistic missiles are sent up above the earth 's atmosphere and carry their own supply of oxygen for their motors . missiles that travel within the atmosphere are " air-breathing . " Gordon N. Converse . Staff Photographer Donald A. Quarks The Air Secretary has been insisting that ballistic missiles will not revolutionize warfare , no matter what country excels in their development . " We have gotten this thing completely out of perspective , " Mr. Quarles said . " We have scared our people to death about something that is , to be sure , a horrifying weapon . " But , he added , " nobody is going to start a war because they have this kind of weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves . And the addition of this weapon to their arsenal , whether or not we have it . will not avoid destruction to themselves . " Mr. Quarles cited the problem of keeping experienced people in the Air Force as one area " on which we must focus more attention . Solution Essential . ' ' I am convinced that no new weapon that we could devise would contribute as much to the efTectiveness of the Air Force as would a solution to our problem of attracting and keeping qualified people . ' ' he said . He added that the pay raise passed last year was - an important step in that direction . But it . was not enough . " He cited the need for improved housing near air bases and more realistic medical and other benefits for dependents and survivors of Air Force personnel . " We must get away from the concept that it is reasonable to expect a serviceman to accept benefits well below the civilian standards , " he said . Although this ' ' could be all right in wartime , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business one that can meet outside competition . "
