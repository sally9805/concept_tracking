txt // thing to be freely approached and recreated by themselves . They have lost the joyful , playful urge of their early youth to shape things into new forms and have become , instead , selfconscious onlookers . This , however , is not the fault of the individual but seems to have been caused by the social changes in life . The Origin of Abstract Art . When , in the great art periods of former times ? say , in the Middle Ages ? an artist painted a Madonna , he was immediately understood by everybody on account of the common , established social and religious background of his contemporaries . Today we are living between two civilizations : the old one went to pieces , the new one is just in the making . An artist of today can be understood only by a clique , not yet by the whole community , as the spiritual content of our civilization is not yet so firmly settled that it may be clearly symbolized by the artist . This may give us also a clue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today whose discoveries have so deeply influenced architecture . The community , being deprived of the old standards of social and religious ideals , confined the artist to isolation . He lost touch with the life of the community . His way out of this dilemma was his attempt to concentrate on the very medium of his art , observing and discovering new phenomena in space and color , and abstaining from any literary content in his work . Naturally , art became severed from the life of the people . That is what we have to face today . Balance Between Experience and Book Knowledge . I am convinced , though , that in every human being there are artistic faculties ; the deeper values of life , however , are being impaired today by putting the emphasis of our existence on secondary considerations : business as an end in itself and this // or that practical occupation . The " trade-mentality , " so to speak , has superseded the desire for a balanced life as it informed former periods . Our whole system of education is directed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as the happy playtime of the child is over he becomes confined to only one sector of life , losing more and more his innate connection with the totality of life . Discrepancy between occupation and vocation is seriously increasing . The courage to venture into other fields of human experience has vanished in our specialized system of production with its almost exclusively material aims . No doubt education has suffered considerably from our overestimation of material aspects and of a one-sided intellectual approach . Good education , aiming at preparing the individual for a creative attitude and for equipoise in life , must certainly lead him beyond mere fact information and book knowledge into direct personal experience and action . We must give our young people more opportunity to acquire such personal experience during their educational training , for only if we make them " find " facts by themselves can knowledge turn into wisdom . It is characteristic of the current trend that most influential educational plans published in recent years treat the visual arts rather casually , not at all as a discipline belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten that , since time immemorial , creative esthetic disciplines in the arts have always generated ethic qualities . We are too overconfident of the benefits from intellectual training . Art , being the product of human desire and inspiration , transcends the realms of logic and reason . It is a field of interest common to all , as beauty is a basic requirement for civilized life . The true aim of all education ? too often forgotten , however // ? is to stimulate enthusiasm toward greater effort . I am convinced that " safety first " is a foul slogan for a young man . The idea of personal security , being in itself an illusion , breeds irresponsibility and egoism . It is a mere materialistic conception . No durable result in any trend of education can be expected without a dominating ideal , the human or social component of which has to direct the professional one ? not vice versa . Although such an aim may appear self-evident , it has become extremely rare in today 's educational practice . Surely a student must be fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamers , secluded from the world , is hardly imminent today . The overemphasis on factknowledge , on intellectual reasoning has obviously carried our generation astray . It has lost touch with the totality of life and with its social implications . Intuitive quality ? eternal source of all creative action ? is being underrated . We see our youth mistrusting their own instincts and denying everything which can not be conclusively reasoned . In my opinion they should , instead , be encouraged to be heedful of their emotions , learning to control rather than to subdue them . They need spiritual guidance beyond professional practicalities to develop their own creative substance , not only their intellect . The greater the spiritual aims , the better youth will conquer material difficulties . When intuition has found food , skill develops most rapidly while routine alone can never supersede creative vision . Highest reality can be given shape only by a being who has comprehended sublimest unreality . // B. CURRICULUM Creative Design . In all great creative periods , architecture in its highest embodiment has been the dominating mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore believe that the architecture of the future is destined to dominate a far more comprehensive sphere than it does today . Today our architectural education is far too timid , overemphasizing scholarly discipline and almost solely directed toward the so-called " Fine Arts " and toward the past . An esthetic conception , so to speak , has fatally displaced a creative conception of art . Creative art and history of art should no longer be confused . " Creating new order " is the artist 's task ; that of the historian , to rediscover and explain orders of the past . Both are equally indispensable , but they have entirely different aims . Successful teaching of creative design can not therefore be handled by historians but only by a creative artist who is a " born teacher . " The architect of the future should create through his work an original , constructive expression of the spiritual and material needs of human life , thus renewing the human spirit instead of rehearsing thought and action of former times . He should act as a co-ordinating organizer of broadest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeds in integrating thought and feeling , bringing purpose and form to harmony . If we expect the future architect to be as many-sided as that , what must his preparation be ? Art in the Nursery . If we start from the conviction that each healthy individual is originally capable of producing form , the optical sense should be developed already in early // childhood . We must remember that the child 's urge to play leads to experiment and invention , source of all sciences and of all arts . Training must be started therefore in nurseries and kindergartens , giving the children abundant opportunity to build , model , draw and paint in a very free form , as in play , which is intended to attract the child and to stimulate his imagination . Art in School . Creativeness in the growing child must be awakened through actual working with all kinds of materials in conjunction with training in free design . Throughout the whole duration of the school manual skill and form perception are to be trained simultaneously by " building " ( with actual materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometrical drawing . But this is important : no copying , no elimination of the urge to play , i.e. , no artistic tutelage ! The whole task of the teacher is constantly to stimulate the child 's imagination and his desire to build and draw . The child 's drawings and models must not even be corrected , for his power of imagination is too easily irritated by grownups if we impose our own wider knowledge too much upon him . Knowledge of facts is indispensable , of course , but it must be taught with sufficient respect toward the younger being 's specific imagination , which differs from our own and which tends to find new expression . Imperceptibly guiding the child during the very difficult transition from play to work , the teacher ? besides giving it the scientific facts and technical advice ? must encourage him again and again by trying to stimulate his indigenous inspiration . Professional Training in Design . Upon leaving school , the young student ? planning to become an architect or designer ? has arrived at that crossroads where a decision is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher education or to go directly into professional training . Here he urgently needs most thoughtful and careful advice . Is his character , his talent , his vision , his perseverance so strong , so promising that he should aim at becoming an independent architect or should he train himself rather to be a skilled draftsman ? In order to diminish the number of false decisions made in this respect a sort of qualification test should be passed by all ? a test of creativeness and power of imagination . All those students , who , possessing artistic talent , have passed the qualification test at the beginning of their training also those who started first in a technical school ? should then be offered a higher training in universities and schools of design . Method of Teaching . For this part of his training consistency of approach in his studies is imperative . Overwhelmed by the profusion of contradictory opinions about the world at large as they are offered by institutions of higher learning he is in danger of becoming apathetic or cynical unless his educators present him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum which should not change its direction until a certain maturity is reached and a conviction has been formed . The objection that such a consistent method would be too onesided is not valid , for only he who has understood really well one way of thinking will be able later to compare it to other ways of thinking and to select elements from them intelligently for his own creative attempts . The teaching of a method of approach is more important than the teaching of skills . It should be a continuing process which must grow concentrically like the annual rings of a tree . In all its stages the scope should be all-embracing instead of sectional , increasing slowly in intensity and detail in all fields // of discipline simultaneously . The integration of the whole range of knowledge and experience is of the greatest importance right from the start ; only then will the totality of aspect make sense in the student 's mind . He will easily absorb all further details and place them where they belong if he progresses from the whole to the details , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start the student off into a creative effort toward integrating simultaneously design , construction and economy of any given task with its social ends . Obvious as this demand appears to be from an intellectual point of view , educational experience has shown that it takes years to bring the student into the habit of simultaneously conceiving all three ? design , construction and economy ? as an inseparable and interdependent entity . The reason for the widespread sectional approach in architectural education seems to be the overemphasis on intellectual academic training and the resulting lack of opportunity for experience in field and workshop . I can not see why knowledge alone should be made the primary object of education , when direct experience is just as indispensable as a basis for subsequent training . Paper has become too exclusive a medium of exchange . The book and the drafting board can not give that invaluable experience gained by trial and error in the workshop and on the building site . Such experience should therefore be interwoven into the training right from the start , not added on later , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For practical experience is the best means of guaranteeing a synthesis of all the emotional and intellectual factors in the student 's mind ; it prevents him from rushing off into " precocious " design , not sufficiently weighted down by the know-how of the building process . No doubt the fatal // separation between craftsmanship and academic learning during the development of the machine age has split architecture from building . The problem of how to co-ordinate both ? scientific knowledge and field experience ? is crucial in our educational system . I will try to outline , therefore , a plan which might help to correct these present deficiencies , starting off first with a suggestion for a more scientific approach in design . The general indolence of people toward the arts and architecture and the prevalent methods of education in design seem to be interdependent . Through improved education people should be encouraged to believe again in the basic importance of art and architecture for their daily lives . But so long as we consider the problems involved to be a matter of individual feelings which can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not expect them to be recognized as basic for educational progress . The spiritual implications of art in society are to be redefined and , with the help of the scientists and using their methods of precision , the social and psychological components of art ? not only the technical ones ? are to be determined by a distinct order of values and meanings . Common Denominator of Design . Basic order in design needs first of all a denominator common to all , derived from facts . A common language of visual communication will give the designer a foundation of solidarity for his spontaneous expression in art ; it will free him from the sad isolation from which he is suffering at present since , in a socially disrupted world , we have lost the common key for understanding the visual arts . // In music a composer still uses a musical key to make his composition understood . Within the framework of only twelve notes the greatest music has been created . Limitation obviously makes the creative mind inventive . In architecture the " golden means , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangulation " of the Gothic builders give evidence that in the past also optical keys have existed , serving as common denominators for the working teams of early builders . For a long period , however , no common denominator has guided our expression in the visual arts . But today , after a long , chaotic period of " l'art pour l'art , " a new language of vision is slowly replacing individualistic terms like " taste " or " feeling " with terms of objective validity . Based on biological facts ? both physical and psychological ? it seeks to represent the impersonal cumulative experience of successive generations . Here roots true tradition . Language of Vision . In modern architecture and design there is a reawakening toward a language of vision . We are able today to feed the creative instinct of a designer with richer knowledge of visual facts , such as the phenomena of optical illusion , of the relation of solids and voids in space , of light and shade , of color and of scale ; objective facts instead of arbitrary , subjective interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never become a recipe for making art . The artist 's inspirational spark transcends logic and reason . But a language of vision derived from old and new discoveries in science controls his creative act . It provides simultaneously the common key for understanding the artist 's message and // transforms its paradoxical content into visible terms of expression . Yet before it can become common to all , it must be made valid through general education . This goal can not be reached by theoretical knowledge alone ; it must be combined with continuous practical experience . Emphasis on Practical Experience . Emotional faculties can not be trained by analytical methods but only by creative disciplines as in music , poetry and the visual arts . Making is certainly not a mere auxiliary to thinking . It is a basic experience indispensable for the unity of purpose within the creative act . It is the only educational means which interrelates our perceptive and inventive faculties . If we compare teaching the arts of design in the past with our present methods of training , the discrepancy becomes apparent at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprenticeship in workshops ? today , from the platonic drafting board . What used to be an auxiliary only for the maker of things ? paper design ? has become the central discipline of the designer . This shift of emphasis from learning by doing to intellectual discipline is typical of the present educational methods in design . But can an architect become a master of his craft without previous experience with tools and materials , without the know-how of an illuminating experience in building and making ? Should architectural education then be separated from its present academic framework ? Many architects would agree with a decisive turn toward greater emphasis on practical experience . I , personally , have grave doubts as to whether the present bookish climate of universities can offer at all a healthy breeding ground for architects . The impact of industrialization on our profession has been so decisive that the // young generation of designers should be trained in close touch with the building industries and with their laboratories . As such a desirable change develops slowly , however , I shall attempt here to outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities , aims at balancing academic learning by direct experiences in the workshop and on the building site . Experimental Workshop and Preliminary Design Course . A continuous training of basic manual skill in experimental workshops combined with disciplines in the fundamentals of surface , volume and space , and of composition ? derived from objective findings ? must be developed on all levels of general and professional education . Both the reinstatement of workshop practice and the introduction of scientific courses leading to a common language of visual communication are basic requirements for successful teaching of the arts of design and especially of architecture . This training should start with a general preliminary course aimed at co-ordinating the elements of handwork and design . As the beginner does not yet know the relationship in which he stands to the world at large , it would be wrong to put the " trade " idea or any specialization at the beginning of his training . In his natural readiness to grasp life as a whole a student should first get a comprehensive view of the vast field of possibilities for expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not sufficient as a preparation . Drawing and painting are certainly most valuable means of self-expression , but paper , pencil , brush and water color are not enough to develop the sense of space so necessary to freedom of expression . The student should be introduced first , therefore , to three-dimensional experiments ; that is , to the // elements of " building , " i.e. , composition in space with all sorts of experiments in materials . For example , observing the contrast between rough and smooth , hard and soft , tension and repose , will help the student to discover for himself by exercise of his hands the peculiarities of materials , their structure and textures . Working with materials , the student begins simultaneously to understand surface , volume , space and color . In addition to technical skill , he develops his own form language in order to be able to give visible expression to his ideas . After he has absorbed the elementary studies , he should then be ready to attempt compositions of his own invention . The aim of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide professional skill . Its success will depend greatly on the qualities of the teacher who , by encouraging and stimulating , must release the student 's own imagination , must oppose with objectivity any reproduction or imitation of other people 's conceptions , including his own . The student will then experience his own ability for making creative short cuts which go beyond his preceding intellectual research . Such a training will give confidence and independence and will thus enhance the productiveness and speed of any subsequent professional training . Professional Training . After such preliminary experience the professional designer can then start his specialized curriculum from solid ground . Still he will need the workshop and the building site all along , to relate his design to the realities of materials and techniques . It is then that he will realize that his knowledge of the language of vision , his skill in construction , in draftsmanship and representation are all indispensable implements for expressing the all-important social end of his creative effort . // Field Practice . In educational practice , the best means of preserving the unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to as many realistic experiences as possible . The problems given should be built up on real conditions , suggesting an actual site and calling in a " client . " The more the collaboration between teachers and students resembles office practice , the better . Visiting buildings under construction , manufacturing plants , research institutes will stimulate the student 's imagination and strengthen his understanding of making and building . But most important , he should work as an apprentice on a building under construction or as an assistant to its clerk-of-the-works , in order to learn to cope with the elements of the building process , the assembly of building parts and the potential frictions between the various subcontractors . How can a student understand flashing and roofing via the drafting board , or the economical and technical problems involved in the sequence of the building process merely from drawings ? In practice only , closely observing the procedure of executing a building from drawings , will he gather experience which will make sense to him . Knowledge collected by others and handed out to him theoretically remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn by experience only and not by authority . Every student , before applying for a professional degree , should therefore see a building being constructed from start to finish ; such experience should be made obligatory . In addition to such field practice , graduate schools should run a laboratory workshop in connection with a sample collection . Here , experiments should be made by teachers and students together for the finish of interior and exterior parts of buildings ? textures and colors ? and of their relations in // space . As the practical part of the architect 's profession is highly technical , he should be given opportunities for experimenting and testing similar to those given to students of medicine , biology and chemistry in their laboratories . History of Art and Architecture . Studies in the history of art and architecture , intellectual and analytical in character , make the student familiar with the conditions and reasons which have brought about the visual expression of the different periods : i.e. , the changes in philosophy , in politics and in means of production caused by new inventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his own previous exercises in surface , volume , space and color ; they can not by themselves , however , develop a code of principles to be valid for present creation in design . Principles have to be established for each period from new creative work . History studies are therefore best offered to older students who have already found self-expression . When the innocent beginner is introduced to the great achievements of the past , he may be too easily discouraged from trying to create for himself . As soon as he has found his bearings , however , through selfexpression in workshop and studio , history studies are a welcome means of refining his thinking without luring him into an imitative attitude . These studies should be started in the third year , instead of in the first year of training . I sum up my conclusions for a transitional approach in architectural education : 1 . The architect is to be a co-ordinator ? a man of vision and professional competence ? whose business it is to unify the many social , technical , economic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect has to recognize the impact of industrializa54 SCOPE OF TOTAL ARCHITECTURE tion and should explore the new relationships dictated by the social and scientific progress . 2 . In an age of specialization , method is more important than information . The training of an architect should be concentric rather than sectional . In essence it should be allinclusive throughout its duration , gaining in certainty of approach ? that is , in clearness of thought and in the knowhow of its realization . It should aim at teaching the student that it is through a creative attitude and independence of conception that he will arrive at basic convictions , not by accepting ready-made formulas . Most essential is the unity of educational purpose . Man is to be the focus ; his spiritual and material needs in relation to the life of the community should determine all stages of the student 's training . 2a . The approach toward any kind of design ? of a chair , a building , a whole town or a regional plan ? should be essentially identical not only in respect to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The common ideal to which all are addressed should be emphasized above their material and technical means of realization ; for all products of design are to be part of the organic whole , part of our man-made environment in town and country . 3 . Three-dimensional conception is the basic architectural discipline . Methods of stimulating interest in visual expression in all fields of the plastic arts must train the student first to see , to perceive distance , and to grasp the human scale . Such disciplines are indispensable for acquiring the instinctive sureness to organize three-dimensional space and to conceive it simultaneously in terms of structural efficiency , economy of means and harmony of appearance . // 4 . Knowledge will come to life only by individual experience . Therefore , designing and building the drafting board and the job ? should be closely related on all levels . Field practice should not be added on as a separate experience , after an academic training of several years ' duration has been completed . It should be an integral part of the curriculum itself . 5 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the students the elements of construction and of " building " by developing three-dimensional exercises to be carried out with materials and tools . At the same time a design course , incorporating actual problems , should focus all activities of the group on the social aim of improving the life of the community . Elements of planning are to be included in these comprehensive initial studies . 6 . In the second and third year , the design-and-construction studio , supplemented by field experience during the summer vacations and by activities in a laboratory , will correlate further experience with the broadening knowledge . The term " field experience " does not refer to work in an office , but to practice directly in the field , as an assistant to the foreman or the supervisor . This field experience ? not less than six months ? should be made obligatory for any professional degree in architecture . It should include also acquaintance with the building industry . 7 . Construction should be taught as part and parcel of design , for both are directly interdependent . Equal emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted so long as he is deficient in either one . Design and construction problems should be related to actual conditions regarding the site and the requirements for the use of the building . They should // be approached as inseparable from the problems of the community which include the all-important factors of economy . 8 . The students should be trained to work in teams ? also with students of related techniques ? in order to learn methods of collaboration with others . This will prepare them for their vital task of becoming co-ordinators of the many individuals involved in the conception and execution of planning and building projects . The nature of teamwork will lead the students to good well-co-ordinated architecture rather than to flashy " stunt " design . 9 . History studies should be started in the third year rather than in the first , to avoid intimidation and imitation . They should help the maturer students to analyze the origin of masterworks of the past and to show him how the architectural conception of a past period , as evident from the remaining examples , resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production . 10 . Teachers should be appointed only after sufficient practical experience of their own , both in design and building . The trend to engage young men as teachers who have just completed an academic training is harmful . For only teachers with broad experience can muster the desirable resourcefulness so necessary to stimulate the student consistently all along . The best education can offer is stimulation , for it makes the student eager to use his own initiative . Every teacher in architecture and engineering should have the right to private practice , for this alone can replenish his resourcefulness . Without such opportunity , he is bound to dry out rapidly and then withdraw to an " authoritative " platform . 11 . Schools of architecture of smaller size ? say , with an enrollment of 100 or 150 students ? are more efficient than // large ones . The most valuable intangible of a school , an intensive " atmosphere , " results from mutual participation of faculty and students in all activities ; this is easily lost in oversized schools so adverse to intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on the number of students per teacher . An architect 's training calls for individual coaching in order to help the student on terms adapted to his own personal talent and state of development . An overburdened teacher will be lost to all of his students . The desirable number of students per teacher should be twelve to sixteen at the most . The emphasis in all my arguments is on the creative factor . That is , that a program of search rather than research makes the creative architect . Such a program , I believe , will lead our potential architects from observation to discovery to invention and finally to an intuitive shaping of our contemporary scene . 5 ? Appraisal of the Development of Modern Architecture* TODAY we are in a position to prove conclusively that the outward forms of modern architecture are not the whim of a few architects hungry for innovation , but the inevitable conse-quential product of the intellectual , social and technical condi-tions of our age . It has taken a quarter of a century of earnest and pregnant struggle to bring these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structural changes when compared with those of the past . I think the present situation can be summed up as follows : a breach has been made with the past which enables us to envisage a new aspect of archi-tecture corresponding to the technical civilization of the age we live in ; the morphology of dead styles has been destroyed and we are returning to honesty of thought and feeling ; the general public , which was formerly indifferent to everything to do with building , has been shaken out of its torpor ; personal interest in architecture as something that concerns every one of us in our daily lives has been aroused in wide circles ; and // the lines of future development have become clearly manifest throughout Europe . But this development has encountered obstacles : confusing theories , dogmas and personal manifestoes ; technical difficulties and finally the dangers arising from formalistic will-o ' - the-wisps . The worst of all of these was that modern architecture became fashionable in several countries ! Imitation , snobbery and mediocrity have distorted the fundamentals of truth and simplicity on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " fitness for purpose equals beauty " have deflected appreciation of the new architecture into minor and purely external channels . This one-sided characterization is reflected in that frequent ignorance of the true motives of its founders , and a fatal obsession which impels superficial people to try to relegate this phenomenon to one isolated province instead of perceiving that it is a bridge which unites opposite poles of thought . The idea of rationalization , which many people aver is the outstanding characteristic of the new architecture , is only its purifying role . The other aspect , the satisfaction of the human soul , is just as important as the material . Both find their counterpart in that unity which is life itself . The liberation of architecture from the mass of ornament , the emphasis on the functions of its structural members and the quest for concise and economical solutions , only represent the material side of that formalizing process on which the practical value of the new architecture depends . What is far more important than this structural economy and its functional emphasis is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for whereas the practical side of building is a matter of // construction and materials , the very nature of architecture makes it dependent on the mastery of space . The transformation from manual to machine production so preoccupied humanity for a century that instead of pressing forward to tackle the real problems of design , men were long content with borrowed styles and formalistic decorations . This state of affairs is over at last . A new conception of building , based on realities , has developed ; and with it has come a new and changed perception of space . The very different appearance of the numerous good examples of the new architecture which already exist exemplify these changes and the new technical means we now use to express them . How far has the struggle progressed in the meantime , and what parts have the various nations played in it ? I will begin with the precursors of the prewar era , and confine myself to contrasting the actual founders of the new architecture up to 1914 : Berlage , Behrens , myself , Poelzig , Loos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a brief balance of their joint achievement . The governing factors in my choice will be , not the esthetics of the buildings concerned , but the degree of independence and creative achievement with which in these buildings their architects have definitely enriched the movement . With one exception this choice is based not on paper projects , but executed designs : a consideration which seems to me of some importance . Germany played the leading role in the development of the new architecture . Long before the war the Deutscher Werkbund had been formed in Germany . At that time such an outstanding leader as Peter Behrens was not a strange or isolated phenomenon . On the contrary , he already had a powerful backing in the Deutscher Werkbund , a body which // formed a reservoir of the forces of progress and renewal . I well remember the animated discussion at the Werkbund 's public sessions during the Cologne Exhibition of 1914 which so many foreigners attended ; and the publication of the first of the Werkbund 's well-known yearbooks at about the same time . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first comprehensive insight into the movement as a result of drawing up a sort of inventory of the existing state of architecture . Between 1912 and 1914 , too , I designed my first two important buildings : the Fagus Factory at Alfeld , and the Office Building for the Cologne Exhibition , both of which clearly evince that emphasis on function which characterizes the new architecture . During this same prewar period Auguste Perret was the leading personality in France . The Theatre des Champs Elysees in Paris , built in 1911-13 , was designed by Perret in collaboration with the Belgian Van de Velde , who was then living in Weimar and working in close contact with the Deutscher Werkbund . Perret 's chief title to fame is his extraordinary constructive skill , which altogether surpasses his gifts as spatial designer . Although more engineer than architect , he indubitably belongs to the founders of modem architecture , for it was he who succeeded in freeing architecture from its ponderous monumentalism by his audacious and wholly unprecedented forms of construction . Yet this great pioneer for long remained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned . In Austria , Otto Wagner had built his Post Office Savings Headquarters in Vienna at the turn of the century . Wagner dared to expose plain surfaces entirely free of decoration and moldings . Today , it is almost impossible for us to imagine what // a revolution such a step implied . Simultaneously Adolph Loos , another Viennese , began writing those articles and books in which he set forth the fundamentals of the new architecture , and building that large shop in the Michaelplatz , immediately opposite the Hofburg in Vienna , which so inflamed the passions of a population accustomed to Baroque forms . In 1913 Futurism was launched in Italy , of which St. Elia , who unfortunately died in the war , was one of the leading adherents . At the 1933 Triennial Exhibition in Milan his memory was invoked by Marinetti , the founder of Futurism , as one of the great originators of the new architecture . St. Elia wrote astonishingly accurate anticipations of the ideology of the coming architecture , but he never had a chance to carry out any practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street remained a paper design . In Holland development was slower . Berlage , De Bazel and Lauweriks , who based their work on anthropological premises , had reanimated the use of geometrical systems in design , and had also , in emulation of those important English pioneers , Ruskin and Morris , inspired a revival of handicrafts . A romantic mystical school continued in Holland until well into the postwar decade . It was in 1917 , three years after the Cologne Exhibition , that the group known as " Stijl " was formed , of which Oud and Van Doesburg became the leaders . In 1914 the most advanced buildings in Holland were Berlage 's office buildings and De Klerk 's housing blocks . In the United States the revival of architecture had begun as far back as the eighties , simultaneously with the development of a new constructional technique . Root built a brick skyscraper in Chicago in 1883 . About the end of the century Sullivan ? Frank Lloyd Wright 's far too // little recognized master ? constructed buildings of this type which are epoch-making , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the functional doctrines of today . We must not forget that it was Sullivan who wrote , " Form should follow function . " Intellectually speaking , he was more articulate in his ideas than Frank Lloyd Wright , who was later to inspire so many European architects in both a spatial and a structural sense . Later on , and more particularly in the postwar period , Frank Lloyd Wright began to manifest a growing attachment to romanticism in his lectures and articles that was in sharp contradiction to the European development of the new architecture . At the present moment the Americans have the most fully developed constructional technique of any nation in the world ? as I had an opportunity of seeing for myself in the course of my investigations in the United States . But in spite of Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright and a very highly developed technical organization , their artistic evolution has remained in abeyance . The intellectual and cultural background necessary for its preparation does not as yet exist . This outlines the most important development in the period prior to the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new architecture blossomed forth simultaneously in several centers . The most organic and continuous progress was made in Germany , where the leaders of the movement were all moving spirits in the Deutscher Werkbund , and a wide circle of supporters was soon found to share their views . In 1919 the Bauhaus was founded at Weimar , and later on its practical influence on housing developments in the cities with its marked social effect became apparent . Thereafter the movement began to be welcomed by public authorities 4t large . // In Holland the " Stijl " movement began to take root ; Oud , Rietveld , and Van Loghem built their first buildings , and the City of Amsterdam its extensive housing estates . The " Stijl " movement had a marked effect as propaganda , but it overemphasized formalistic tendencies , and so provided the impulse that made " cubic " forms fashionable . The structural concepts of the new architecture are now beginning to oust the theories which inspired the Dutch Modernists . About the same time , the French-Swiss Corbusier , who had studied for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1916 he was still using pilasters and cornices , but shortly afterward he started to edit L'Esprit Nouveau , and to produce architectural and literary work of an astonishingly wide scope which made a profound impression on the young generation in every country . But in contrast to Germany , where a whole following had sprung up in and around the Bauhaus , the movement in France developed only as the purely person concern of a few individuals ; and people in general remained indifferent , with the result that no new school arose as a logical result of their activities . Switzerland produced a number of capable architects after the war who considerably influenced the movement , more particularly in regard to town planning . The Stockholm Exhibition of 1930 was an important success for the new architecture in the Scandinavian countries . England 's contribution has been confined to housing and town planning ; but Sir Raymond Unwin 's ideas and the English garden cities have influenced the whole European housing movement . Bourgeois accomplished useful pioneering work in Belgium , and has taken a successful part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been formed in Czechoslovakia , Poland , Spain and England ; while a very active Japanese group exists at Osaka . In the United States , the Austrian Neutra and the Dane Lonberg-Holm , who have made their home there , and who are both men of outstanding initiative and energy , are carrying on the movement . The younger generation of Americans , some of whom studied at the Bauhaus , are slowly beginning to find their bearings and evolve their own formal components . The appearance of co-operative working groups , to which I have just drawn attention , is characteristic of the latest development of the new architecture . In countries which might be supposed to have least in common with one another similar free organizations of young architects have been formed , roughly speaking , on the Bauhaus model , who collaborate in practical and experimental work . I consider this co-operative principle particularly promising , and very appropriate to the spirit of our age ; especially when these groups include engineers and economists . Such groups ? when led by men who possess the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit ? are a guarantee for the thoroughness and many-sidedness of the work produced , as each member inspires his fellow . But groups of this kind must be founded on a voluntary basis . It is impossible to run them within the usual frame of rules and regulations . An international organization based on the same principles called " Les Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne " ( CIAM ) was formed in Switzerland ; to which twenty-seven national groups have since adhered . The objects of the congress are to pool the experience of the different countries , and to co-ordinate the results so as to provide practical data and sound directives for town planning and to insure their // recognition and adoption in the various countries . This orientation of the congress work is not , of course , accidental , but represents a direct continuation of the original principles of the new architecture applied to the larger unit of the town . The conception which the new kind of architect has of his calling , as that of a co-ordinating organizer , whose business it is to resolve all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in a comprehensive unity , has inevitably extended his researches beyond the house to the street , from the street to the more complete organism which is the city itself ; and ultimately into the wider field of regional and national planning . I believe that the future development of the new architecture is bound to embrace these wider spheres , and concern itself with all their congruent details ; and that it must inevitably progress toward an ever fuller conception of the province of design and construction as one vast indivisible whole whose roots are embedded in life itself . In the face of these proofs of the genuineness of the movement no one who takes the trouble to investigate its sources can possibly still maintain that it is based on an antitraditional obsession for technique qua technique which blindly seeks to destroy deeper loyalties and is doomed to lead to the deification of pure materialism . The order by which it seeks to restrict arbitrary caprice is the result of a most thorough social , technical and artistic investigation . I believe that our conception of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since respect for tradition does not imply an esthetic preoccupation with bygone forms of art , but is , and always has been , a struggle for essentials ? that is to say , a struggle to get at what is at the back of all technique , which is forever seeking visible expression with its help . 6 . Archeology or Architecture for Contemporary Buildings ? * ARCHITECTURE is said to be a true mirror of the life and social behavior of a period . If that is true , we should be able to read from its present features the driving forces of our own time . There is conflicting evidence , however . If we compare current public buildings ? for example , the " classical " charac-ter of the National Gallery in Washington ? with the con-temporary character of the new group of buildings for the United Nations , a deep-seated controversy becomes apparent . We will find an even more puzzling discrepancy if we observe the current state of collegiate architecture , which is hound , of course , to influence the next generation growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition or the Georgian tradition or should it fulfill the requirements of new college buildings by using " modern " means of expression unpreju-diced by any period design ? And , if this last trend seems to have become more prevalent in recent years , why is that so ? What is happening to tradition ? What stand will finally be // taken by responsible educators ? These questions seem to touch the very roots of our civilization , laying open both its weaknesses and its virtues . Good original architecture depends just as much on an understanding public as on its creators . Vasari tells the revealing story of Brunelleschi 's cathedral in Florence and how the entire population participated in its development . People get the kind of architecture they are ready for , and tendencies in education which foster either creative habits or imitative habits are decisive in forming their attitude . One of the consequences of our purely analytical and intellectual approach to education has been the habit of teaching the visual arts by historical and critical methods of appreciation and information instead of by participation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has generally displaced a creative conception of art . Here , then , we find the very reason for the timid attitude so often shown when the architectural character of new college buildings has to be decided upon . We seem to have forgotten that there is an opportunity to make architectural history for ourselves and to have buildings designed in unmistakable terms of our own period . What we need is a new code of visual values . So long as we flounder about in a limitless welter of borrowed artistic expression , we shall not succeed in giving form and substance to our own culture , for this implies selective choice of those artistic means which best express the ideas and spiritual directions of our time . The impact of environment on a young man during his // college years is certainly decisive . If the college is to be the cultural breeding ground for the coming generation , its attitude should be creative , not imitative . Stimulating environment is just as important to free the student 's creative talent as vigorous teaching . Accordingly , the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So long as we do not ask him to go about in period clothes , it seems absurd to build college buildings in pseudoperiod design . How can we expect our students to become bold and fearless in thought and action if we encase them timidly in sentimental shrines , feigning a culture which has long since disappeared ? The physical and spiritual functions determining the design of a building are interdependent . They are both part of our present life . It is an anachronism to express the physical functions with the newest technical means but to express the spiritual functions by borrowing a historical shell from the past . Such an attempt confuses the art of architecture with applied archeology . Genuine architecture of organic growth implies continuous renewal . As history shows , the conception of " beauty " has changed along with progress in thought and technique . Whenever man imagined he had found " eternal beauty , " he fell back into imitation and stagnation . True tradition is the result of constant growth ; its quality must be dynamic , not static , to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vantage point , I now look at my own immediate problem in hand ? the design of the new Graduate Center for Harvard University ? and contemplate the way in which these structures can be made into a vital link between the historic mission of a great educational institution and the // restless , inquisitive minds of the young men and women of today , I know that it can not be done without enlisting the student 's wholehearted emotional response as well as by paying due respect to the specific architectural tradition of Harvard University . What now is this tradition ? Harvard 's " Yard , " so familiar to many sons of this country , shows a sound basic theme of architectural design which has been reverently kept throughout the centuries by almost all the architects who have contributed individual buildings ; a composition of quadrangles , varying in size and confined by individually different buildings , offers a sequence of arresting surprises in space . This spatial theme fulfills an ancient requirement of the art of architecture ? namely , to balance artfully the building masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience and sense harmonious space and scale . The buildings themselves , however , though each is an integral part of the whole , do not " match . " Harvard 's most famous architectural bequests , built during three centuries , could hardly differ more strikingly in their enriching contrasts of forms and colors . Yet they all conform to the noble spatial pattern of the Harvard Yard . Careful study of this existing pattern of open spaces and structures has therefore become the starting point for the design of the new Harvard Graduate Center . For here lies the inherent tradition of the Yard ; its timeless pattern may well be interpreted again today in new terms of architecture , valid for present-day life . There is no need to emulate the " atmosphere " of this or that period . New buildings must be invented , not copied . The great periods of architecture in the past have never imitated the // periods of their forefathers . In one and the same famous building we can find , side by side , the characteristic shapes of the Romanesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copying to be found in order to preserve an external " cosmetic " uniformity . Unity was expressed by adherence to the given spatial order of existing buildings , not by imitating their veneers ; exterior conformity was never mandatory in the past . Only our esthetic preoccupation with bygone periods has forced the " classical " facade on hundreds of college buildings built in the industrial age . I believe that a different approach is needed which would seek to interpret by a new architectural expression the great changes which have taken place in our time . For instance , it is a challenging problem in modem architecture to make use of repetitive standard parts , but at the same time to organize these parts in groups which vary in appearance . In the Graduate Center we strove to break the monotony which might have resulted from repetitive fenestration by changing the direction of the dormitory blocks as well as the design of their ends and links . This has resulted in a variety of different views for the onlooker . We have also learned that the human being needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert . To produce such a stimulus for him contemporary artists and architects try to create the illusion of motion . The confining , cagelike Georgian windows which in their time were necessary due to limitations in the manufacturing of glass have been supplanted by large window openings and undivided glass panes . These permit us to make sections of outdoor space a part of the total architectural composition which does not stop at walls as in the past , but produces the // illusion of a continuity of space in motion . This new relationship of interior spaces to the infinite reaches of the outdoors is a characteristic new achievement of modern architecture which consciously or subconsciously must influence everybody 's mind . Building with elements of the handicraft periods in an age of industrialization is becoming more and more a hopeless task , which either bogs down in financial difficulties because of the paucity of skillful labor needed or ends in a lifeless fake product of industrial origin . We can not go on indefinitely reviving revivals . Architecture must move on or die . Its new life must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields during the last two generations . Neither medievalism nor colonialism can express the life of the twentieth-century man . There is no finality in architecture ? only continuous change . ? 7 ? The Architect Within Our Industrial Society* BACKGROUND Analysis . In my analysis I anticipate that architecture as an art starts beyond the demands of construc-tion and economy on the psychological plane of human existence . The satisfaction of the human psyche resulting from beauty is just as important for a full , civilized life , or even more so , than the fulfillment of our material comfort requirements . The emotional blocks which bar the development of more organically balanced living must be met at the psycho-logical level , just as our practical problems are met at the technical level . Is the maker of the rose or the tulip an artist or a technician ? Both , for in nature utility and beauty are constitutional quali-ties , mutually and truthfully interdependent . The organic form process in nature is the perpetual model for every human cre-ation , whether it results from the mental strife of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all still have before our mind that unity of environment and spirit that prevailed in the horse and buggy time . We sense that our own period has lost that unity , that the sickness of // our present chaotic environment , its often pitiful ugliness and disorder have resulted from our failure to put basic human needs above economical and industrial requirements . Overwhelmed by the miraculous potentialities of the machine human greed has obviously interfered with the biological cycle of human companionship which keeps a community healthy . At the lower level of society the human being has been degraded by being used as an industrial tool . This is the real cause for the fight between capital and labor and for the deterioration of community relations . We now face the difficult task to rebalance the life of the community and to humanize the impact of the machine . It dawns on us that the social component weighs heavier than all the technical , economic and esthetic problems involved . The key for a successful rebuilding of our environment ? which is the architect 's great task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the dominant factor . But in spite of the effort of quite a few of us , we obviously did not yet find the spiritual bond to hold us together for a concerted effort at establishing a cultural denominator strong enough to becalm our fears and to grow into a common standard of expression . The artists among us must grow impatient for such a synthesis , which would make whole what is now still unhappily disconnected . We can not deny that art and architecture had become an esthetic end in themselves , because they had lost touch with the community and the people during the industrial revolution . The external embellishments of a building were designed mainly to outdo those of the neighboring building instead of being developed as a type fit to be used repeatedly as a unit // in an organic neighborhood pattern . The emphasis on being different instead of searching for a common denominator characterized our last generation of architects who dreaded the antihuman influence of the machine . The new philosophy in architecture recognizes the predominance of human and social requirements and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfill these very requirements . If we look backward into the past we discover the curious fact that a combination of both , a common denominator of form expression and individual variety was in evidence . The desire to repeat a good standard form seems to be a function of society , and that was true long before the impact of industrialization . The designation " standard " as such has nothing to do with the means of producing it ? the hand tool or the machine . Our future houses will not necessarily be regimented because of standardization and prefabrication ; natural competition on the free market will take care of individual variety of the component parts of buildings , just as we experience today a rich diversity of types for machinemade everyday goods on the market . Men did not hesitate to accept widely repeated , standard forms in the premachine periods of civilization . Such standards resulted from their means of production and from their way of living . They represented a combination of the very best many individuals have contributed to the solution of a problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy blend of technique and imagination , or rather a complete coincidence of both . This spirit ? though by no means its dated forms ? should be revived to create our own environment , with our new means of production , the machine . But if they are not constantly checked and renewed , standTHE // ands become stagnant . We know now that it is a futile attempt to try to match standards of the past , that our recent obsession with the idea that new buildings must always match existing ones betrayed a terrible weakness of our time , a silent admission of spiritual bankruptcy , for which there is no other example in the past . After the revolution in our own ranks , which has brought clarification , we seem to be set for a new creative effort . So it might be appropriate to investigate how far our professional framework fits the condition of our time , which I have tried to outline . Let 's see whether the gigantic shift in the methods of production has been sufficiently recognized by us . For we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and as we are not living in a period of sweet contemplation and security , we should reconsider our basic principles , for there are certainly some disturbing facts we can not disregard any longer . In the great periods of the past the architect was the " master of the crafts " or " master builder " who played a very prominent role within the whole production process of his time . But with the shift from crafts to industry he is no longer in this governing position . Today the architect is not the " master of the building industry . " Deserted by the best craftsmen ( who have gone into industry , toolmaking , testing and researching ) , he has continued thinking in terms of the old craft methods , pathetically unaware of the colossal impact of industrialization . The architect is in a very real danger of losing his grip in competition with the engineer , the scientist and the builder unless he adjusts his attitude and aims to meet the new situation . Separation of Design and Execution . Complete separation of design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8o SCOPE OF TOTAL ARCHITECTURE today , seems to be altogether artificial if we compare it to the process of building in the great periods of the past . We have withdrawn much too far from that original and natural approach , when conception and realization of a building were one indivisible process and when architect and builder were one and the same person . The architect of the future ? if he wants to rise to the top again ? will be forced by the trend of events to draw closer once more to the building production . If he will build up a closely co-operating team together with the engineer , the scientist and the builder , then design , construction and economy may again become an entity ? a fusion of art , science and business . I will be more specific and reveal my target : The American Institute of Architects at its 1949 convention added to the mandatory rules of the Institute a new paragraph which reads : " An architect may not engage directly or indirectly in building contracting . " I have very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the separation of design and construction . Instead we should try to find an organic reunification which would return to us the mastery of the know-how in building . Of course , the intention of this mandatory paragraph has been a good one , namely to block unfair competition . But I am afraid that it represents merely a negative veto and does not try to solve our dilemma constructively . Let us not deceive ourselves as to the strength of our present position in the eyes of our clients . The average private client seems to consider us as members of a luxury profession whom he can call in if there is some extra money available for " beautification . " He does not seem to consider us as essential for the building effort as the builder and the engineer . // If you think I exaggerate , look at the facts in the U.S.A. : More than 80 per cent of all U.S. buildings are being built without an architect . Average income of the architect is less than a bricklayer makes in the East . People generally do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define it , and we have not been able sufficiently to clarify the issue . When a client is in the building mood , he wants to buy the complete building for a fixed price and at a definite time of delivery . He is not at all interested in the question of the division of labor between architect , engineer and contractor . Since he senses subconsciously that it is rather artificial to keep design and building so wide apart , he usually concludes that the architect may be the unknown " X " in his calculations , in terms of money as well as time . And what else can we expect ? Are we not in an almost impossible position , having to meet a set price , though we have to start almost every commission with a kind of research and laboratory approach ? Compare that with the long process in industry from paper design to test model to final product . In our field of design we have to absorb all the cost of research ourselves , for with us the model and the end product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost unsolvable task , particularly because it is subject to changes caused either by the client or by public agencies ? We often question the soundness of the business angle of our activities when we realize that the greater the ingenuity and the harder the work we devote to reducing costs , the more we are penalized by lesser payment . The client on the other hand assumes that it must be in the material interest of the // architect to increase the building cost deliberately , since this would also increase the architect 's percentage fee . So he often tries to settle for a lump sum fee . Of course we have to oppose that tendency of the client , as it is quite unfair to us , but that does not solve the ticklish problem in either direction . Here indeed is our greatest ethical dilemma . It often causes distrust on the part of the client , because of its inherent injustice to both parties ; it even keeps many clients from seeking our service altogether . Example of Industrial Designer . This does not happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for his initial service to develop the model , plus royalties from multiplication of the product . He benefits from the success of his work not only financially , but also in stature as a legitimate member of the team to which he belongs , along with the scientist , the engineer and the businessman . This process , developing more and more in industry , is carrying the previously isolated artist-designer back into the fold of society . I am convinced that a similarly co-ordinated teamwork will also become the trend within the building industry . This should give the future architect , who is by vocation coordinator of the many activities concerned with building , once more the opportunity to become the master builder ? if we are only willing to make the necessary changes in attitude and training . Of course , whether he shall be able , personally , to reach the high historical aim of his profession to integrate through his work all social , technical and esthetic components into a comprehensive , humanly appealing whole , that will depend on his creative vision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the master depends of course on his performance within the collaborating team . He can not claim leadership as // such , for the best man in a team should lead . But the historical mission of the architect has always been to achieve the complete co-ordination of all efforts in building up man 's physical surroundings . If he wants to be faithful to this high mission , he must train the rising generation in conformity with the new means of industrial production instead of confining them to a training at the platonic drafting board , isolated from making and building . Industrialization and Prefabrication . The machine certainly has not stopped at the threshold of building . The industrialization process of building seems only to take longer to complete than it took in other fields of production , since building is so much more complex . One component part of building after another is being taken out of the hands of the craftsman and given to the machine . We have only to look at manufacturers ' catalogues to become convinced that already an infinite variety of industrialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradual evolutionary procedure , the hand-building process of old is being transformed into an assembly process of ready-made industrial parts sent from the factory to the site . Furthermore , the proportionate percentage of mechanical equipment in our buildings is steadily increasing . Prefabrication has penetrated much further into the building of skyscrapers than into residential building . But , to be honest with ourselves , we must admit that only relatively few of us architects have directly taken part in influencing and performing this great change , or in designing those component parts which we all use in building . It is the engineer and the scientist who have been instrumental in this development . That is why we have to speed up to regain lost ground by training our young generation of architects for their // twofold task : ( 1 ) to join the building industry and to take active part in developing and forming all those component parts for building , and ( 2 ) to learn how to compose beautiful buildings from these industrialized parts . This presupposes , in my opinion , much more direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contact with industry and builders than our usual training provides . The coming generation of architects must bridge that fatal gap between design and building . To begin with , let 's stop squabbling about styles ; every architect owes it to himself to defend the integrity of his design effort . What matters to the profession as a whole is to close ranks , to do some hard thinking together , and then to come to constructive decisions as to how we may reopen the gate leading into the field of building production for the benefit of the younger generation of architects . They are beginning to lose confidence in the trusteeship character of our professional setup and in its logical result : the self-appointed prima donna architect . Architects in the future will refuse to be restrained from a natural urge to take actual part in a team effort with the industry to produce buildings and their parts . The emphasis , I believe , will be more and more on the team . Teamwork . For years I have been personally concerned , through my activities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they leave school and enter into practice . I have seen them make valiant attempts to establish themselves independently , and I have seen them more often resign themselves to work indefinitely as draftsmen in large offices which offer little or no chance of exercising individual initiative . It is sad to see so much youthful energy and talent dry up by the slow attrition of our more and more centralized working // system . Democratic concepts can not easily survive the assaults of our increasing mechanization and superorganization , unless an antidote is used which may protect the individual in his struggle against the leveling effect of the mass mind . I have tried to find such an antidote by introducing my students in Harvard , besides their individual training , to the experience of working in teams . This has become a valuable stimulant to students as well as to teachers who were all equally unacquainted with the advantages and difficulties of collaborating in groups . Now they had to learn to collaborate without losing their identity . This is to me an urgent task lying before the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all our endeavors to create an integrated society . In our particular field there is no book of rules for such collaboration , unless we go back as far as the Middle Ages to study the working teams of the great cathedral builders . Most striking within the organization of those building guilds was the fact that until late in the eighteenth century every craftsman on the job was not an executing hand only , but was permitted to put his own design into his part of the work as long as he abided by the master 's guiding key of design , which was the secret , geometrical auxiliary of the building guilds , similar to the keys in musical composition . Preconceived paper design hardly existed at all ; the group lived together , discussed the task and built their ideas . Compare this with our present conditions . We are expected to put all our design ideas , unto the last screw , into drawings and specifications . Then an army of workmen has to execute our design . We are hardly permitted to make any changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or imagination properly to judge the effect of every detail of // his preconceived design ; even less so the more he stays aloof from the practical process of building and making . Nor has the workman of today any chance to contribute to the design of a building . Since the time of the building guilds , collaboration among men , which would release the creative instincts of the individual instead of smothering them , has not been practiced much and we find very little knowledge about the basic requirements which made such teamwork possible . It is so unknown today in our profession that it is apt to be even viewed with apprehension , because the ideology of the past century has taught us to see in the individual genius the only embodiment of true and pure art . It is true that the creative spark originates always with the individual , but by working in close collaboration with others toward a common aim , he will attain greater heights of achievement through the stimulation and challenging critique of his teammates , than by living in an ivory tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under any circumstance , even against heavy odds , but if we want to raise the average performance , teamwork becomes essential to sharpen and improve the individual contribution . The conditio sine qua non of true teamwork is voluntariness ; it can not be established by command . It calls for an unprejudiced state of mind and for the firm belief that togetherness of thought and action is a prerequisite for the growth of human culture . Individual talent will assert itself quickly in such a group and will profit for its part from the cross-fertilization of minds in the give and take of daily contact . True leadership can emerge when all members have a chance to become leaders by performance , not by appointment . Leadership does not depend on innate talent only , but // very much on one 's intensity of conviction and devotion to serve . Serving and leading seem to be interdependent . Our time is probably as rich as any in original talent , but too often this is doomed to spend itself in isolated accidental bursts of creativity because its message is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could reclaim the individual genius for his natural task , i.e. , to work as a Primus inter pares ? first among equals ? instead of in exalted isolation , a much broader basis for understanding and response could be formed . Certainly good intention alone is not sufficient for building up a team . We have to relearn methods of collaboration . It takes considerable time to acquire certain habits which seem indispensable for fruitful teamwork . I discovered that it was first of all imperative that every participant of the team must tell the other members right from the start what he is thinking and doing in a continuous mutual exchange . But even if everyone has the best intention to proceed that way in the beginning , it takes quite a while to train oneself to this end . Then this exchange becomes indispensable , as it places the different individuals in the right place within the collaborating team and , of course , everyone likes to do what he is particularly fitted for . Research then grows quickly , and a variety of opinions develops into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the flood of so many objective problems that have to be solved , the natural vanity of the individual is slowly drowned . The task grows gradually above the individual , who finally hardly remembers who initiated this or that part of the idea , as all their thoughts resulted from mutual stimulation . The stature of the individual grows under this voluntary collective effort of the team . As democracy obviously hinges // on our ability to co-operate , I want the architect , as a co-ordinator by vocation , to lead the way toward developing the new technique of collaboration in teams . The essence of such technique should be to emphasize individual freedom of initiative , instead of authoritative direction by a boss . Experi-menting with teamwork keeps one resilient and flexible and its methods are probably more adaptable to the rapid changes of our time than the boss-employee relationship . Synchronizing all individual efforts the team can raise its integrated work to higher potentials than is represented by the sum of the work of just so many individuals . I should like to leave no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for future building must certainly reach into the field of production . Increasing specialization needs ever growing co-ordination . To accomplish the first of the twofold tasks of the future ? the development of the component building parts ? the archi-tect needs to build up a team with the scientist and the manufacturer . His second task ? the design of finished build-ings from such component parts , and their actual assembly on the site ? should be solved in a closely integrated collaboration between him , the engineer and the builder in direct contact with industrial methods and research. * It is quite obvious that we as individual architects have no facilities to test new materials and new technological methods , and even less to control our wealth of new technical potentialities the way the // master builder of old controlled the crafts . In order to become more effective again for the whole process of building , we need the team and the production tools of industry . But we should not assume that our self-determined privilege to act as leader of the team will be accepted per se @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk to join the team as equals and then to show by way of our own performance whether we shall be able to act as first among equals and so finally to change that rank order of public esteem in the architect 's favor . The essential difference of our industrialized society compared to a society of handcraftsmen rests upon the distribution of labor , not upon the tools used . A complicated textile machine represents only a refinement of the early hand loom . But it marks a change of principal importance if the entity of a working process is handled by one and the same craftsman , or if it is subdivided into many fragments , each of which is being put into the hands of another worker , as at the assembly line . It is this atomizing effect of the subdivision of labor which has exploded the coherence of the premachine society , not the machine itself . I confidently hope that organically built-up teamwork will gradually give us back that essential connectedness which is indispensable for a unity of effort . I have merely tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come . One of the two roads appears rough but wide and full of venture and hope . The other narrow one may lead into a dead end . I have made my personal choice where to go , but being along in years , all I can do is to urge those who represent the next generation to search for a constructive solution how to correlate again design and execution in their future practice by direct participation in industrial and building production . g0 SCOPE OF TOTAL ARCHITECTURE For I can not convince myself that it shows a lack of integrity when a young architect and a young builder decide to join hands in order to build up a complete modern service ? both design and building execution . We should instead actively encourage such a natural combination . I have been asked whether it would not leave the client high and dry when he is deprived of the trustee control of his architect . My reply is that we do not need trustees for buying our everyday goods ; we select them on account of the good reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see any difference as to buildings and their component parts . Of course , I know that the task of reconciling design and execution ? which should be inseparable ? will still meet a great many difficulties which can only be slowly solved in practice . But it is always a change of attitude first which precedes any implementation of a new course of direction . This proposal I certainly do not think of as a cure-all for the ills that beset our profession . Nobody knows yet which measures will have to be taken to protect it against unfair competition , while at the same time giving the green light to those who want to take creative part also in the production itself of buildings and building parts . All I propose to do in today 's state of fluidity is to keep the door open to a new set of problems , and knotty ones at that , which are the result of the impact of industrialization and must be solved by the new generation of architects . 8 . Architect ? Servant or Leader ? * MODERN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? it is new growth coming right from the roots . This does not mean , however , that we are witness to the sudden advent of a " new style . " What we see and experience is a movement in flux which has created a fundamentally different outlook on architecture . Its underlying philosophy knits well with the big trends in today 's science and art , steadying it against those forces which try to block its advance and to retard the growing power of its ideas . ' What Constitutes a " Style " ? The irrepressible urge of critics to classify contemporary movements which are still in flux by putting each neatly in a coffin with a style label on it has increased the widespread confusion in understanding the dynamic forces of the new movement in architecture and planning . What we looked for was a new approach not a new style . A style is a successive repetition of an expression which has become settled already as a common denominator for a whole period . But the attempt to classify and thereby to freeze living art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , into a " style " or " ism " is more likely to stifle than 91 // to stimulate creative activity . We live in a period of reshuffling our entire life ; the old society went to pieces under the impact of the machine , the new one is still in the making . The flow of continuous growth , the change in expression in accordance with the changes of our life is what matters in our design work , not the hunt after formalistic " style " features . And how deceiving a precipitate terminology can be ! Let us analyze , for instance , that most unfortunate designation , " The International Style . " It is not a style because it is still in flux , nor is it international because its tendency is the opposite ? namely , to find regional , indigenous expression derived from the environment , the climate , the landscape , the habits of the people . Styles in my opinion should be named and outlined by the historian only for past periods . In the present we lack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . As humans we are vain and jealous and that distorts objective vision . Why do n't we leave it , then , to the future historians to settle the history of today 's growth in architecture and go to work and let it grow ? I 'd like to suggest that in a period when the leading spirits of mankind try to see the human problems on earth as interdependent , as one world , any chauvinistic national prejudice regarding the shares claimed in the development of modern architecture must result in narrowing limitation . Why split hairs about who influenced whom when all that really matters is whether the results achieved improved our life ? I dare say that we are all much more influenced by each other today than architects of former centuries because of the rapid development of interchange and intercommunication . This should be welcome as it enriches us and promotes a common denominator of underARCHITECT ? SERVANT // standing so badly needed . ( I tried to encourage my students to let themselves be influenced by ideas of others , as long as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them new life in a context that represents their own approach to design . ) Search for Common Denominator Versus Ego Cult . If we look back to see what has been achieved during the last thirty or forty years we find that the artistic gentleman-architect who turned out charming Tudor mansions with all modern conveniences has almost vanished . This type of applied archeology is disappearing fast . It is melting in the fire of our conviction that the architect should conceive buildings not as monuments but as receptacles for the flow of life which they have to serve , and that his conception must be flexible enough to create a background fit to absorb the dynamic features of our modern life . We know that a period piece of architecture could never satisfy such a demand , but it is just as easy to create a modern straitjacket as a Tudor one ? particularly if the architect approaches his task solely with the intention of creating a memorial to his own genius . This arrogant misapprehension of what a good architect should be often prevailed , even after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were searching for new expression in design would even outdo the eclecticist by striving to be " different , " to seek the unique , the unheard of , the stunt . This cult of the ego has delayed the general acceptance of the sound trends in modern architecture . Remnants of this mentality must be eliminated before the true spirit of the architectural revolution can take root among the people everywhere and produce a common form expression of our time after almost half a century of trial and error . This will presuppose // a determined attitude of the new architect to direct his efforts toward finding the type , the best common denominator instead of toward the provocative stunt . Preconceived ideas of form , whether the outcome of personal whims or fashionable styles , tend to force the stream of life in a building into rigid channels and to hamper the natural activities of the people therein . The pioneers of the new movement in architecture developed methodically a new approach to the whole problem of " design for living . " Interested in relating their work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual unit as part of a greater whole . This social idea contrasts strongly with the work of the egocentric prima donna architect who forces his personal fancy on an intimidated client , creating solitary monuments of individual esthetic significance . The Client . By this statement I do not mean that we architects should docilely accept the client 's views . We have to lead him into a conception which we must form to fit his needs . If he calls on us to fulfill some whims and fancies of his which do not make sense , we have to find out what real need may be behind these vague dreams of his and try to lead him in a consistent , over-all approach . We must spare no effort on our part to convince him conclusively and without conceit . We have to make the diagnosis of what the client needs on the strength of our competence . When a man is ill he certainly would n't insist on telling his physician how to treat him , but , if we expect such trust from our client , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accorded to the medical profession . If we have not been competent enough to deserve being trusted , we had better make sure that we are in the future ? in design , in construction and in economy , as well as in the social conception , which // embraces the three other components of our work . If we neglect to make ourselves highly competent in all these fields , or if we shun responsibility in leading the way , we resign ourselves to the level of minor technicians . Architecture needs conviction and leadership . It can not be decided upon by clients or by Gallup Polls , which would most often only reveal a wish to continue what everybody knows best . Machine and Science in Service of Human Life . There is another argument going on which , distorting the aims of modern architecture , needs clarification . We hear : " The modern accent is on living , not on the machine , " and Le Corbusier 's slogan , " The house is a machine for living , " is old hat . With it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement as men of rigid , mechanistic conceptions , addicted to the glorification of the machine and quite indifferent to intimate human values . Being one of these monsters myself , I wonder how we managed to survive on such meager fare . The truth is that the problem of how to humanize the machine was in the foreground of our early discussions and that a new way of living was the focus of our thoughts . To devise new means to serve human ends , the Bauhaus , for instance , made an intense attempt to live what it preached and to find the balance in the struggle for utilitarian , esthetic and psychological demands . Functionalism was not considered a rationalistic process merely . It embraced the psychological problems as well . The idea was that our design should function both physically and psychologically . We realized that emotional needs are just as imperative as any utilitarian ones and demand to be satisfied . The machine and the new potentialities of science were of greatest interest to us , but the emphasis was g6 SCOPE OF TOTAL ARCHITECTURE not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the machine and science in the service of human life . Looking back , I find that our period has dealt too little with the machine , not too much . What Is Regional Expression ? Another confusing factor in the development of modern architecture is the appearance now and then of deserters from our cause who fall back on nineteenth-century eclecticism for lack of strength to go consistently through with a rejuvenation from the roots up . Designers turn back to features and fancies of the past to be mixed into the modern design , fondly believing that this will create greater popularity for modern architecture . They are too impatient to reach their goal by legitimate means and so they only conjure up a new " ism " instead of a new genuine regional expression . True regional character can not be found through sentimental or imitative approach by incorporating either old emblems or the newest local fashions which disappear as fast as they appear . But if you take , for instance , the basic differ-ence imposed on architectural design by the climatic conditions of California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity of expression can result from this fact alone if the architect will use the utterly contrasting indoor-outdoor relations of these two regions as focus for his design conception . Here I should like to mention one problem that all archi-tectural schools have in common : as long as our teaching centers only around the platonic drafting board we are perpetually in danger of raising the " precocious designer . " For it is almost unavoidable that the lack of practical experi-ence in the field , in the crafts and industrial processes of build-ing leads at least some students to an all too ready acceptance of current style ideas , fads and clichts . This is the consequence // of an all too academic training . Therefore , any opportunity to go into the field and to take part in all or any phases of the building process should be readily grasped by the young designer as a most essential discipline to establish balance between knowledge and experience . Service and Leadership . But you might say , " What has this to do with the topic of this article : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already implicit in what I have said before , is simple : put an " and " in place of the " or . " Serving and leading seem to be interdependent . The good architect must serve the people and simultaneously show real leadership built up upon a real conviction : leadership to guide his client as well as the working team entrusted with the job . Leadership does not depend on innate talent only , but very much also on one 's intensity of conviction and willingness to serve . How can he reach this status ? I have often been asked by students what I could advise them to do to become independent architects after leaving school and how they could avoid selling out their conviction to a society still pretty ignorant of the new ideas in architecture and planning . My answer is this : Making a living can not be the only aim of a young man who should want above all to realize his own creative ideas . Your problem is , therefore , how to keep the integrity of your conviction intact , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . You may not succeed in finding a position with an architect who shares your approach in design and who could give you further guidance . Then I would suggest you take a paying job wherever you can sell your skill , but keep your interests alive by a consistent effort carried on in leisure hours . Try to build up a working team with one or two friends in // your neighborhood , choose a vital topic within your community , and try to solve it , step by step , in group work . Put ceaseless effort into it , then someday you will be able to offer the public , together with your group , a well-substantiated solution for this problem , for which you have become an expert . Meanwhile , publish it , exhibit it and you may succeed in becoming an adviser to your community authorities . Create strategic centers where people are confronted with a new reality and then try to weather the inevitable stage of violent criticism until people have learned to redevelop their atrophied physical and mental capacities to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discern between the vital , real needs of the people and the pattern of inertia and habit that is so often advanced as " the will of the people . " The stark and frightening realities of our world will not be softened by dressing them up with the " new look " and it will be equally futile to try to humanize our mechanized civilization by adding sentimental fripperies to our homes . But if the human factor is becoming more and more dominant in our work , architecture will reveal the emotional qualities of the designer in the very bones of the buildings , not in the trimmings only ; it will be the result of both good service and good leadership . Planning and Housing CIAM 1928-1953* DURING the twenty-five years of its existence I have been a devoted member of the CLAM . Now it seems fitting that I express myself as to what this international stronghold of architects and planners has meant to me during the long fight for a new architecture . The most important was the fact that in a world full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of architects felt the necessity to rally in an effort to see the many-sided problems that confronted them as a totality . The decision to put this conception of totality above all limited objectives has determined our attitude , our convictions , our faith . It is this idea that acted like a magnetic force under the most diverse conditions and among groups of widely different national and racial traditions . It started in Europe , but today it reaches to the four corners of the earth . That has enriched us . The fact that the racial or national genius of different countries often tends to be preoccupied with one particular approach to our common adventure in living to the IoI // exclusion of others makes us feel how badly we need the corrective stimulus of other forms of living , emphasizing different values . For instance : it seems that the youngest generation in the U.S.A. ? down to the five-year-olds ? is wholly fascinated by the problems of the conquest of outer space . They watch breathlessly as the scientists of the world are beginning to chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in settling our earthly affairs . Their imagination is looking for new frontiers , almost unmindful of the confusion and derangement created during this ardent dash toward the unknown . Brought face to face with the problems and blessings of those parts of the world that we call " the underdeveloped countries , " we find their cultures have often given us a clearer insight into the deepest motives of human living than the complicated civilizations that we have created for ourselves . At this point we sometimes seem to regret the loss of their ancient roots and ties even more than they do themselves , but it would be a great mistake to think that they could preserve their integrity if they did not take part in the evolutionary process that binds us together now . The one thing they usually remember more distinctly than any of us is the fact that man lives also for the pursuit of happiness and I wish there would be more research by architects into what exactly are the prerequisites for this thing called " happiness . " There was a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonleaking roof was the most important requirement for happiness , but we have since found out that though it may stop the rain , it does not necessarily create a happy human climate . I want to affirm , therefore , that I believe the creation of 7 // beauty and the forming of values and standards to be the innermost desire of a human being and that this moves him more deeply and more lastingly than the satisfactions of comfort . In our daily struggle to put that nonleaking roof over the heads of unsheltered millions we forget this too easily . CIAM , I confidently hope , will go on fighting for its original conception of totality with man as the measure for all our problems in planning and architecture . I O. Sociological Premises for the Minimum Dwelling of Urban Industrial Populations* THE over-all progress in housing design during the years fol-lowing the First World War reveals that development of the minimum dwelling has reached a stalemate , evidently because deep-rooted changes in the social structure of nations which require the establishment of new standards in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not received adequate attention . Determination of these changes in society must be the starting point for any work in this direction . Recognition of the evolutionary development of man 's biologi-cal and sociological life processes must lead to a definition of the task at hand ; only after this has been accomplished will it be possible to solve the second part of the problem , the estab-lishment of a practical program for realizing the minimum dwelling . The history of sociology is the story of man 's gradual evolu-tion from the wilderness through barbarism to civilization . // The late German sociologist Muller-Lyer , * whose scientific results are referred to , distinguishes between four major legal eras of human society : The era of kinship and tribal law The era of the family and family law The era of the individual and individual law The future era of co-operatives and communal law He establishes these as the successive phases of gradual social refinement . A detailed examination of these phases is useful because their regularity shows clearly that certain phenomena in modern society which are regarded by many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a society which is in the process of stratification . In prehistoric times the individual is only a member of society ; his actions are purely social . The individual is not yet awakened . The first signs of beginning individualism manifest them-selves in the subjugation of woman by man . The patriarchal family arises and persists up to the formation of our modern industrial state . The subjugation of woman is followed by the enslavement of man by the ruler . Stratification of society into lords and serfs liberates the ruling class so that it can devote itself to higher cultural problems . The masses are trained to labor , but the rights of the individual are suppressed . Rule by force in the warring state is followed by rule by money in the industrial state . In both states the propertied class rules , the masses become impoverished . The industrial state , inspired by increasing scientific knowledge , develops more advanced methods of production . The exploitation of Io6 SCOPE OF TOTAL ARCHITECTURE nature offers the possibility of a life worthy of culture for all . Egotistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual becomes the aim of the state and the structure of society the means for its achievement . Thus the concept of the tribe and the patriarchal family evolves into the ideal of an independent individual and finally into that of a future communal union which transcends the individual . Inspired by the economic life of nations , the idea of rationalization is today growing into a major intellectual movement in which the actions of the individual are gradually being brought into beneficial relation with the welfare of society as a whole , a concept which transcends that of economic expediency for the individual alone . From the motive of " reason , " social consciousness arises . This evolutionary process is paralleled by changes in the structure and significance of the family . The patriarchal family was characterized by supreme sovereignty of the family head . The wife lived in intellectual sterility and subjugation , and the children , even when grown up , were subordinated by absolute obedience to the will of the family head . Relatives and serfs , later the servants , apprentices and journeymen , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-sufficient microcosm , the unit of production and consumption in the state . The eighteenth century marks the flight of serfs from the feudal master household to the free cities . The number of small families with their structure of parental sovereignty increases . With the spread of the concept of the rights of the individual , the family progressively surrenders its functions to the // state and thus the importance of the family unit in the sociological picture gradually decreases . The invention of the machine leads to the socialization of labor . Goods are no longer produced for one 's own needs but for the purpose of exchange within the society . One product of domestic industry after another is wrested from the family and transferred to socialized industry . The smaller unit , the family , thus loses its character as a self-contained productive unit . With the progressive emergence of the individual the human birth rate decreases , in a manner analogous to phenomena observed in other forms of life , and it decreases in all civilized countries . The will of the individual , armed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth control for reasons of predominantly economic nature . Within the span of one single generation the two-child pattern is established in all the civilized countries . On the basis of surveys in the European countries and in America , the average family may be assumed to comprise 4.5 members . This number is averaged over urban as well as rural districts . The average family size in larger cities is below 4 throughout . According to determinations by the German census bureau ( 1928 ) , the birth rate in Germany was 35.6 per 1,000 population in the year 1900 , and 18.4 per 1,000 population in the year 1927 . It had thus decreased to a mere half . Nonetheless , there is still a birth excess of 6.4 per thousand . In other civilized countries the decline in birth rate and the resulting decrease in family size progresses at a similar pace . The birth rate in the various countries decreases with increasxo8 SCOPE OF TOTAL ARCHITECTURE ing industrialization , but there is still an excess of births in them all . In the patriarchal system the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state places a portion of the children 's education in the hands of specially trained pedagogues in public schools . It thus intrudes into the relations between parents and children and regulates them according to the views of society . It establishes social security laws to provide insurance for old age , disease and physical handicap and thereby gradually relieves the family of its responsibility to care for the aged , the sick and the handicapped . Whereas the sons in a patriarchal family inherited their father 's trade , this caste system is dying out and the vocational castes which supersede the birth castes promote early departure from the parental home . The individual 's mobility increases with the increasing transportation facilities , and the family is thereby diffused and diminished . The patriarchal relationship between the family head and the journeymen , servants and apprentices is replaced by financial relationships as the barter economy is displaced by the financial economy . The activities of the family have become too limited to occupy all its members . The family domicile has become too expensive and too confined to shelter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free servants , but with the progressive socialization of labor their number gradually decreases as more and more of them escape the family yoke to seek personal freedom and independence in industry . In most European countries today the demand for domestic servants exceeds the supply by a factor of two . In the United States the shortage of domestic help is already causing families to move into hotels , // in which the domestic chores of the small family are economically centralized . The confined dwelling is also losing its suitability for social intercourse , and intellectual inspiration is sought outside the family circle ; the number of restaurants and clubs for men and women is increasing rapidly . The rented apartment is replacing the ancestral family home , attachment to the home town ceases , and a new era of nomad individuals begins , fostered by the rapid development of mechanized transportation . The family is losing its home just as the tribe lost its territory . The cohesive power of the family is yielding to the rights of the individual citizen of the state . The conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employment at will , and population mobility is increasing tremendously . Most of the former family functions are gradually being assumed by society , and the importance of the family decreases despite its continued existence , while the state as such becomes institutionalized . Past development thus shows steadily progressing socializadon of former family functions of legal , pedagogic and domestic nature , and thus we perceive the first beginnings of a communal era which might someday displace the era of individual rights . One further phenomenon has a decisive effect on the structure of the modern family . As the family era was ushered in by the rise of man , so the individual era is characterized by the awakening and progressive emancipation of woman . Woman 's duty of obedience to man vanishes , and the laws of society gradually grant her rights equal to those of men . As the family transfers numerous domestic chores to the machinery II.O SCOPE OF TOTAL ARCHITECTURE of socialized production , woman 's sphere of domestic activity shrinks and she looks beyond the family for an outlet for her natural need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . In turn industry , rejuvenated on basically new foundations by the machine , shows woman the impractical nature of her domestic hand labor . Recognition of the shortcomings of the individual household awakens thoughts about new forms of centralized master households which partially relieve the individual woman of her domestic tasks by means of an improved centralized organization which is capable of performing them better and more economically than she can perform them herself , even when she applies all her efforts . The growing shortage of domestic help further emphasizes such desires . In the hard battle for subsistence faced by the entire family , the woman seeks ways of gaining free time for herself and her children while participating in gainful occupations and liberating herself from dependence upon the man . Thus the process does not seem to be motivated exclusively by the economic plight of urban populations , but it is the manifestation of an internal drive which is connected with the intellectual and economic emancipation of woman to equal partnership with man . The organizational structure of such master households for single men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newlyweds or for ideological and economic communities of various forms is connected intimately with the problem of the minimum dwelling . It is of course true that even in the present age , for which our practical work is intended , all forms of human society , old and new , continue to exist side by side ; it is quite obvious , however , that one form predominates at any given time ; the SOCIOLOGICAL PREMISES FOR MINIMUM DWELLING 11 I importance of the individual and his independent rights today overshadows that of the family as a sovereign unit . The rise to independence of the woman dissolved a powerful family bond ; the forced marriage of old has practically vanished , and France in the days of the Revolution already considered marriage legally as merely a contract between citizens , which implies the right to divorce ; woman finally achieved suffrage and thus political equality with man . Liberated from the limited horizon of the household , she extends her influence to cultural spheres . The increasing independence achieved by woman produces modifications of a fundamental nature in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compulsory institution sanctioned by the state and the church , it evolves gradually into a voluntary union of persons who retain their intellectual and economic independence . Economically speak-ing , the family is reduced to the functions of reproduction and breeding selection . The stronger the organization of the social contract , the smaller the sphere remaining to the family . In its trend toward collective thinking , the institution of individual-ism is following the path pursued by its forerunner , the institu-tion of family supremacy . The evolutionary development outlined above is reflected by the following statistics , furnished by the German census bureau : In addition , according to information from physicians which it is difficult to obtain statistically , the number of abortions has increased substantially : 1I2 SCOPE OF TOTAL ARCHITECTURE The ratio of the number of gainfully employed women to that of gainfully employed men ( 1920 ? 21 ) : According to information supplied by the Prussian district census bureau for Berlin in 1925 : Of 5 women above age 20 , only 3 are married . Of 3 gainfully employed persons , 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married women , 1 is gainfully employed . Of 5 single women , 4 are gainfully employed . Of 2 gainfully employed women , 1 is simultaneously a housewife . In 1927 46% of all dwellings in Germany have only 1 ? 3 rooms . Policy-making government agencies charged with housing administration find it necessary , first of all , to observe the trends of social development , because the most difficult phase of their activity is the correct numerical estimation of the extent to which these general developments will progress within the population of their jurisdictional area . Only after formulation of this estimate are they in a position to distinguish between the numerical requirements for resolving both the older , familiar types of housing shortages , wherever they are still pronounced , as well as the newer , more individually differentiated needs , and to assign suitable housing to both groups . Almost all districts are still basing their policies of urban housing procurement to an excessive extent upon the old familial form of life , a pattern which by itself is no longer // capable of describing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of a number of apartments in the form of a centralized master household has become necessary in order to lighten the burden of gainfully employed women and thus preserve them for marriage and reproduction . The sociological facts must first be clarified in order that the ideal minimum of a life necessity , the dwelling , and the minimum cost of its production may be found ; in view of the change in underlying principles , the program for a minimum dwelling can naturally not be solved by simply reducing the conventional , larger apartment in number of rooms and effective area . An entirely new formulation is required , based on a knowledge of the natural and sociological minimum requirements , unobscured by the veil of traditionally imagined historical needs . We must attempt to establish minimum standards for all countries , based on biological facts and geographic and climatic conditions . This approach is in the spirit of the impending equalization of life requirements under the influence of travel and world trade . The problem of the minimum dwelling is that of establishing the elementary minimum of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that he be able to fully develop his life functions without experiencing restrictions due to his dwelling , i.e. , a minimum modus vivendi in place of a modus non moriendi . The actual minimum varies according to local conditions of city and country , landscape and climate ; a given quantity of air space in the dwelling has different meanings in a narrow city street and in a sparsely settled suburb . Von Drigalski , Paul Vogler and other hygienists observe that , given good conditions of ventilation and sunlight , man 's requirements of living space from the biological viewpoint are // very small , particularly if the space is correctly organized for efficiency ; a graphic picture of the superiority of a small modern apartment over an obsolete one is provided by the comparison offered by a well-known architect between an ingeniously arranged wardrobe trunk and a crate . However , if the provision of light , sun , air and warmth is culturally more important and , with normal land prices , more economical than an increase in space , then the rules dictate : enlarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on food rather than heat . Just as it was formerly customary to overestimate the value of food calories in comparison with that of vitamins , many people nowadays erroneously regard larger rooms and larger mtments a the desirable aim in dwelling design . To allow for the increasing development of more pronounced individuality of life within the society and the individual 's justified demand for occasional withdrawal from his surroundings , it is necessary , moreover , to establish the following ideal minimum requirement : every adult shall have his own room , small though it may be ! The basic dwelling implied by these fundamental requirements would then represent the practical minimum which fulfills its purpose and intentions : the standard dwelling . The same biological considerations which determine the size of the minimum dwelling are also determinative in regard to its grouping and incorporation into the city plan . Maximum light , sun and air for all dwellings ! In view of differences in the quality of the air and the intensity of the light , an attempt must be made to establish a numerically defined lower limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and air can be calculated for given local conditions . General quantitative regulations which fail to allow for differences , as they exist at present , are useless in many cases . To be sure , it is the basic aim of all urban building codes to ensure light and air for dwellings . Every new building code has surpassed its predecessor in striving to decrease the population density and thereby to improve conditions of light and air . However , all means employed thus far for decreasing population density are based on the concept of the permanent , close-knit family . The only ideal solution was thought to be the single detached dwelling , the one-family house with garden , and on the basis of this aim the excessive population density of cities was combatted by limiting building height . However , this aim is no longer adequate today , as sociology shows , because it satisfies only a portion of the public needs , but not the needs of the industrial population , which is the primary object of our investigations . The internal structure of the industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multistory apartment house , and finally toward the centralized master household . The healthy tendency to progressively decrease the population density in cities is in no way endangered by this new form of dwelling , since the population density of a zone can be controlled without limiting the building height by merely establishing a quantitative ratio of dwelling area or building volume to building lot area . This would pave the way for a vertical development of the multistory apartment building . Whereas the detached one-family house is more suited to the needs of other , wealthier population classes which are not under consideration at present , the large apartment building satisfies more nearly the sociological requirements of present-day industrial populations with their symptomatic liberation of the individual and early separation // of the children from the family . In addition , the large highrise apartment building offers considerable cultural advantages as compared to the walk-up apartment house with a small number of floors . For a comparison in the case of alternating parallel blocks of apartments with north-south orientation and having blocks of varying height ( two to ten floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c , d . The results derived from this comparison ensure that the large high-rise apartment building will have the biologically important advantages of more sun and light , larger distances between neighboring buildings , and the possibility of providing extensive , connected parks and play areas between the blocks . It thus appears necessary to develop the well-organized high-rise apartment building technically , incorporating in its design the ideas of the centralized master household , i.e. , to develop gradually the centralization and specialization of the domestic work associated with the small family . Such a large apartment house does not represent a necessary evil accompanying a period of regressive decay , but a biologically motivated , genuine residential building type of the future for urban industrial populations . The objections of one-sided defenders of houses against the idea of the residential skyscraper on the grounds that natural instincts attach man to the ground are without biological foundation . Modern urban industrial population is derived directly from the rural population . It retains its primitive standard of living , which frequently even decreases , instead of developing expanded requirements corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt its housing requirements to its old form of // life appears regressive for the reasons described and altogether incompatible with its new form of life . Previous experience in the various countries reveals that there is a gap between the cost of producing dwellings and the average income of the families . It is thus not possible to satisfy the housing requirements of the masses within the framework of a free economy . As a result , the state is beginning to relieve the family provider of a portion of his responsibilities in this respect as well and to gradually equalize the discrepancies caused by present rent levels with the aid of subsidies and other measures . Indeed , the construction of low-cost dwellings offers little temptation to industry and banking , whose natural tendency it is to derive maximum profits from production and investments . Since technology operates within the framework of industry and finance and since any cost reduction achieved must first of all be exploited for the benefit of private industry , it will only be able to provide cheaper and more varied dwellings if the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare measures . If the minimum dwelling is to be realized at rent levels which the population can afford , the government must therefore be requested to : 1 . Prevent the waste of public funds for apartments of excessive size , while facilitating the financing of the construction of minimum dwellings , for which an upper limit of apartment size must be established . 2 . Reduce the initial cost of roads and utilities . 3 . Provide the building sites and remove them from the hands of speculators . 4 . Liberalize as far as possible the zoning regulations and building codes . I18 SCOPE OF TOTAL ARCHITECTURE On the average , one-quarter of the income is considered a tolerable rent . It will have to be determined whether or not the program to be planned can be realized within the scope of actual rent levels . However , present-day minimum requirements of apartment hunters , which are a result of impoverishment , should not serve as a criterion for establishing the minimum dwelling if an absolute , biologically motivated result is to be achieved ; it would therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income of the average family . Instead , the properly established standard , the " rationed dwelling , " must become the minimum requirement of every gainfully employed person ; it then is up to the community to find means for making this " rationed dwelling " accessible to all the employed . I I. Houses , Walk-ups or High-rise Apartment Blocks ? * WHAT is the most rational building height in the grouping of low-cost dwellings from the viewpoint of city planning ? To clarify the problem , it seems expedient to first define more closely the concept " rational . " The term literally means " according to reason , " and thus in the present case it implies not only economic considerations , but primarily also those of psychological and sociological nature .
