Twelve hundred atomic scientists tucked away their well-filled notebooks , exchanged goodbyes and headed home from Geneva 's Palace of Nations . After 13 veil-lifting days of give and take , the first International Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy ( TIME , Aug. 22 ) was over . The talk had shed new light on every facet of peacetime atomics , from prospecting for ore to H-power . The last major debate : the biological hazards involved in nonmilitary use of the atom . <P> The " producers " of radioactivity ( reactor men and weapons makers ) maintained that , with proper precautions , there was little to worry about . But from the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission 's huge Hanford plutonium plant near the Columbia River in Washington , came a plain-spoken report of how even the tightest precautions have some leaks . Radioactive wastes from Hanford , e.g. , phosphorous , got into the river in water that had been used to cool the Hanford reactors . The waste was first absorbed by diatoms , tiny simple-celled plants , then by the larvae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiophosphorous concentration 100,000 times the normal amount . <P> Even young birds , particularly swallows , showed radioactive concentrations 500,000 times greater than normal after feeding on diatom-eating insects . Some animals , e.g. , jack rabbits , were also affected after eating grass that had been irradiated , probably by particles escaping from Hanford 's chimneys . None of the present radiation is dangerous , thanks to AEC precautions , but if the radioactive material in the Columbia were allowed to reach the maximum level considered safe for ordinary drinking water , fish from the river would soon be unfit for food . <P> To radiation " consumers " ( geneticists and physicians ) , the possible hazards of the atomic age were of grave concern . Even the most cheerful geneticists admitted that no certain " safe threshold " of radioactivity has yet been determined . Any increase in world radioactivity may upset the delicate balance in the number of damaging mutations that the human race can stand and cripple future generations . Said the AEC 's John C. Bugher : " We are running a risk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive side , Geneva loaded the scientists with new ideas . Said one U.S. official : " You ca n't rub that many good brains together without getting sparks . " Among the many sparks : <P> NEW REACTORS . British , Dutch and U.S. scientists spelled out almost to " do-it-yourself " simplicity the operations of their most advanced reactor designs . Chief among them : AEC 's Brookhaven liquid-metal fuel reactor , powered by circulating molten solution of uranium in bismuth , in a " blanket " of thorium-bismuth compound ( **52;10997;TOOLONG ) . The thorium breeds U-233 , which is recycled as fuel , making fuel costs " negligible . " <P> EXTRACTING FUEL . New techniques , for extracting thorium and uranium from ordinary granite were revealed by U.S. scientists . One ton of granite would yield uranium and thorium with the energy equivalent of ten to 15 tons of coal .
