26 . WIZENED workman watched Americans trying a locked door in the Kurihama barracks of the Japanese National Police Reserve , frowned , spread his hands and decided to be helpful . All the way down a hall , he ran after a khaki-clad back which might have the key . And as he scampered , he shouted , " Oi , heitai-san ! Anno-ne ! " Which translates , " Hey , soldier ! " Of course , the little man was confused , and it can be proved by the book . The khaki belonged to a Japanese police patrolman , not a soldier . There are no Japanese soldiers , only police reservists , 75,000 of them . And the fact that they live in soldiers ' barracks , march like soldiers , train like soldiers and actlike soldiers is a pure coincidence , nothing more . But it does confuse a lot of people . General Douglas MacArthur informed the Japanese Government of his ideas for a national constitution in 1946 . Among them was this statement : " War as a sovereign right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instrument for settling its disputes and even for preserving its own security . . . no Japanese Army , Navy or Air Force will ever be authorized and no rights of belligerency will ever be conferred upon any Japanese force . " The constitution subsequently adopted by the Japanese Diet and approved by Allied occupying forces picked up this statement almost word for word in Chapter II , which reads : " Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order , the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes . In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph , land , sea and air forces , as well as other war potential , will never be maintained . The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized . " All Japanese armed forces had been disbanded prior to that time and their entire equipment ? guns , planes , tanks and even uniform stocks  --  destroyed or turned over to Allied ( Continued on Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continued from Page 57 ) It was barely dawn when Maegon came into view , and the dockside was barely stirring as the Daffodil took up her old place , but with such a difference , beside the overhanging freighter . Within an hour Matthew Fletcher and Kim Lhee , with Alan Pratt and Li Wu , were at the Government Building , seated before a transmitting set , recording . Kim Lhee began , in his own language , telling that the New Zealand correspondent had returned to Maegon . He kept his voice unemotional , he did a beautiful job of broadgasting as he , by omission , allowed listeners to guess the story that lay behind the news . Then , in English , he introduced Matthew Fletcher , who clasped the microphone between his hands as he spoke . " Hello , Australia , " said he , trying to keep casual . " Hello , New Zealand ; hello , Americans . This is Matthew Fletcher introducing Alan Pratt . In a day or so , while Alan is still hopped up with whatever it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not talk , but was talked through , we shall be back in Melbourne , where Alan will be able to tell his story . Now , for a moment , here is Alan Pratt . " And the faltering voice of the correspondent came over the air , over the free air ; and as he spoke his weakness began to go from him , and all over the world the radio stations picked up his first free message . As his voice grew clearer , and as the joy that was in it became more audible , even in the first few moments of the broadcast , he began to sound like one who had returned from the dead ; or from the worse than dead . His voice , then at Maegon , and later from Melbourne and Auckland , gave people a feeling that freedom wan sweeter than life ; that , as a ship to a sailorman , as a child to its mother , can give joy , that joy must be earned by caring . More than the poets have done , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , began to rouse people , like so many Daffodils , from grimy lethargy , so that the tide turned and lifted them also . THE JAPS ARE MARCHING AGAIN ( ( eoin ' . d front Page 26 ) governments . Japanese munitions factories were closed down and retooled for civilian manufactures or abandoned . The nation was not even permitted to make sporting firearms or ammunition of any type . American occupation forces used some Japanese army and navy installations . The remainder were torn down or left idle . Only the metropolitan and rural police-95,000 in one and 30,000 in the other  --  were left as peace-keeping organizations , and even these were redesigned to eliminate military influences . As a disarmament job , it was as nearly complete as any in modern history . Japan operated no airplanes , military or otherwise ; no large ships which by the wildest stretch of imagination could be converted to war uses ? with the exception of a few mine sweepers occupied in clearing away mines the Japanese themselves had laid in their harbors  --  and no factories which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure reasons , began carrying pistols  --  American-made .95 's  --  a little over a year ago , for the first time in their history . Otherwise , the disarmed situation remained static until the outbreak of the Korean war . Then , almost overnight , American occupation forces all but vanished from Japan . Combat units got immediate orders and even housekeeping soldiers ? typists , clerks , cooks and casuals  --  were hurriedly transferred to beef up understrength line companies . Huge areas of Japan were left with no protection whatever except isolated rural policemen , who operate singly or in such small groups that the force never can bring important strength to bear quickly at any one point . A couple of regiments of any invading force could have walked into Tokyo without serious land interference . In this potential emergency , a new directive was issued by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers , which said , in part : " I have visualized the progressive development of law-enforcing agencies adequate to the maintenance of internal security and order and the safeguardi ng ofJa pan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I authorize your government to take the necessary measures to establish a National Police Reserve of 75,000 men and expand the existing authorized strength of the personnel serving under the Maritime Safety Board by an additional 8000 men . " This Coast-Guard-type organization already had 10,000 men . The result was startling . All over the four Japanese islands highly colored posters appeared on the walls of police stations and municipal buildings . The most striking was an overblown figure of a young Japanese wearing a khaki uniform somewhat similar to that of Australian soldiers . On his left arm was a red , yellow and blue shoulder patch ? a dove on a shield . Above the right shirt pocket was a series of gold-cloth bars , another bird figure and a pair of stylized chrysanthemums in metal . The cap repeated the bird emblem and was short-billed with a high crown  --  a cap very familiar to any American infantryman who ever fought against Japanese naval " special troops " in World War II . Across the picture spread huge Japanese characters which translate : " Defend the Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed to " those who are capable of leading men and also have considerable social experience or special technique ... and must be strong in health and have a rightthinking mind . " For the 75,000 places available in the new National Police Reserve , 375,000 applications poured in to recruiting offices set up by the rural police . The recruiters were able to hand-pick their rookies , and did so . Half of those accepted were veterans of the Japanese armed forces . Sixty per cent had been farmers in the uneasy years after the war . A quota of youngsters in their teens brought the average age down to about twenty-three years . Most of the ex-army men had been sergeants , warrant officers or in the lower commissioned ranks . Virtually all Japanese officers above the rank of captain were barred from this and other government employment under purge orders affecting all former " professional " officers . By an odd order of circumstances , 3200 of these barred officers were " depurged " ? the manufactured words are those of Japanese newspapers published in English  --  on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them would end up in the new police reserve . But reserve officials immediately announced that the depurging had come too late . Both enlisted and officer ranks in the new organization were already full . Keikichi Masuhara , a lifelong police official with experience in Formosa and Malaya , took over as civilian director general of the reserve . And elegant Keizo Hayashi , vice grand steward of the Imperial Household and a former prefectural governor , became uniformed head of the force . Both appointments were made by the prime minister in the presence of the Japanese Emperor . Masuhara holds his job at the pleasure of the prime minister , but Hayashi is unlikely to be affected by political changes . The 75,000 eager recruits were immediately distributed to twenty-nine encampments scattered all the was from Hokkaido ? the chilly norther , island nearest Siberia ? to Southem Kyushu , where an officers ' training school was set up on the small island of Eta . Seventy-five thousand American carbines were distributed , along with combat boots made by Japanese manufacturers on American models  --  and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be rebuilt for smaller Japanese feet . Summer and winter uniforms , blankets and mess equipment completed the issue . Likelylooking candidates , mostly army veterans , were appointed acting officers . But they carefully were given nomnilitary titles ranging downward from " superintendents " in four classes through " inspectors " in three more , as commissioned men . Then grades descended through sergeants and patrolmen in various classes in the noncommissioned ranks . Teams of three or four American officers and a few enlisted men were detailed from new arrivals in Japan , the recovering wounded from Korea and the few remaining occupation troops to advise on a training program at each camp . An American basic infantry manual was translated as a guide for drills . Intelligence tests were offered to all recruits who wished to try for permanent officer commissions . The organization is just four months old as this is written , and most of the men have been in camps for more than seven or eight weeks . Here at Kurihama , 3000 of them occupy an old naval academy 's excellent buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and specialists at the National Reserve headquarters in Tokyo ? another old academy . Several thousand occupy American installations on Hokkaido ? the American troops that built them are fighting in Korea  --  and others are scattered wherever the reserve could find room . Sendai , in Northern Honshu , has half a dozen camps . Still more are being prepared for use by the reserve when and if the Americans come back from Korea to claim their own barracks . All enlisted men live on the posts , but a few officers have family quarters in nearby villages . Men drill or work a forty-eight-hour week . Their uniforms , at first puzzling to occupation personnel and Japanese civilians , are now fairly familiar during week ends on the streets of Tokyo and other cities ? but not in the expensive restaurants . Re- a week-end pass might have gone scotfree  --  except that his elderly mother , half his size , hauled him up to the reserve-camp gate , literally leading him by the ear , and turned him over to his sergeant . But gradually the reserve is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early organization snarls are eliminated . The hard core of army veterans is beginning to have a definite effect on morale and discipline . Considering who they are , this is not surprising . Mankichi Hara , a handsome temporary officer , may he a little more than typical . He knows a trifle about barracks life , having put in nine years as enlisted man and warrant officer in the Japanese Army . As a sergeant in 1943 , he took four men up a hill in North China and came down again with a fair-sized bag ? 250 Chinese prisoners ? from an army then commanded by Mao Tse-tung , present premier of Red China  --  five heavy machine guns , fifteen light machine guns , ten mortars and ? a hundred rifles . For this feat , he was recommended for the Sixth Order of the Golden Kite , one of the most prized Japanese army medals . However , such medals normally were actually awarded only when the hero returned to Japan . Hera was in an army which surrendered to the Chinese in 1945 and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did get his medal . Nevertheless , he found four years of operating a vineyard very dull . " I missed the army life , " he says . " Things did n't seem natural without it . " So he volunteered for the reserve in spite of the fact that he has a wife and two children at home . Perhaps more typical is Inspector First Class Akira Yamagami , a muscular former second lieutenant in the Japanese cavalry . He now proudly wears a pin signifying that he was in the first class to graduate from the reserve 's staff school in Tokyo . At twenty-nine he not only is a veteran of the war in North China but after the Japanese surrender became an instructor for the Chinese Nationalist Army , then mayor of his own village in Japan 's Hyogo Prefecture . But although he , too , had a family and owned his own land , he volunteered at the first call for the reserve . Apropos of nothing in particular , during an interview with me he suddenly said that he still thought horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Asiatic continent . The roster of veterans in the reserve goes on like this endlessly . One staffschool student was a captain ? " I got better pay then " ? in an army-engineer battalion in Southeast Asia . Here at Kurihama , Soichi Okada does n't need too much basic-drill instruction  --  he was six years in the army , fought in Canton and Malaya and also was recommended for the Order of the Golden Kite for swimming the channel to Singapore to set up the first Japanese communications when that British bastion was under attack . He came into the reserve , he says , " because I wanted to get more training in communications equipment . " Ex-Warrant Officer Hachiyo Fujihara could have worn the Order of the Rising Sun medal in the Japanese Army , where he served nine years . At thirty-three he is glad to be back in uniform , with or without medals . " At home , " he says , " I was a storekeeper . I did n't like it . " The curriculum at the Tokyo staff school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior training at the basic officers ' school on Kyushu , is designed to make them the real leaders of the reserve . On the day this reporter looked in on classes fifty students were bent in deep concentration over notebooks . The first four questioned were ex-captains in the army . An American major , with the help of a huge chart and an interpreter , was explaining the exact functions of a combat-engineer battalion in the United States Army . After an hour , the class took a tenminute break . Then a second United States Army major quickly ran through the functional organization of a combat signal company and its relation to a division . Both officers were questioned repeatedly over such confusions as the Japanese translation for " message center " ? which came out as " intelligence-collecting center " ? and the exact function of what in English was a " construction platoon , " but in Japanese meant " building platoon . " Both lecturers and interpreters also struggled with the additional problem of giving all the duties of first lieutenants to inspectors first class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the classroom during the lectures was the dull rhythm from the drill ground outside , where 1000 * * * * * * * * * * .1 strapless evening gown is one type of holdup that never lack ? , witnesses . ? HOWARD HAYNES . * * * * * * * * * * clerks-to-be in squads and platoons were marching forward and to the rear under the harsh commands of training officers . This , then , is the Japanese National Police Reserve-75,000 quite capable young men , many combat-trained , armed with carbines and scattered over the four islands of Japan , which are directly in the path of communist aggression in Asia . In a hemisphere full of rumors and outright lies  --  such as the communist claim that Japanese soldiers were used in Korea  --  the existence of this three-month-old force is one reality . That it continues to exist in spite of the fact that the pay is poor , that any of the men can quit when they want to , and that morale remains high in spite of such communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight as an army in Korea , perhaps indicates something about Japanese character . What its existence really means is debatable . Hayashi , with many words and considerable waving of long fingers , says in effect , " The purpose of this organization is to create an example for Japan . This will be the model for the nation . " On the other hand , Sylvia Crane , a Saturday Evening Post representative who speaks Japanese , is disturbed by a small detail . Asking questions of a pair of recruits , she was answered in Japanese phrases which used the diminutive endings . Oversimplified , this meant that for the first time in four years , Japanese men spoke to her as they would to any Japanese woman  --  and any woman is their obvious inferior . It was not necessarily insulting , but close to it . An elderly Japanese gardener also shakes his head , and the gist of what he has to say is , " Well , I suppose it 's necessary , but I do n't like it . It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic . " This reserve , " he says , " might maintain order in Japan if the Americans left . But only for a little while . Japan is a small country , subject to influences from both sides of the Pacific . The reserve could maintain order for only a little while . " But this is a year of realism in the Orient . This is the year when a Japanese gardener  --  the same who deplores the existence of the reserve  --  can listen to stories of atrocities in Korea and bow to his American employer . He says , " You should have sent the Japanese to Korea . We understand how to deal with matters like that . " This is also the year when the whole Western World is beginning to realize exactly how few are its friends in the Orient and how many its enemies . For that reason , if for no other , the reserve is not so embarrassing to anybody as it would have been a year ago . Of course , it would be distinctly embarrassing for the Allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have an army again , to admit to the Japanese now that they need one , and quickly . But , as this is written , no such bald admission is necessary . The Japanese Reserve is a 75,000-man police force without a military title in it . That it has no very clear police duties is beside the point , and its interest in such matters as combat-engineer battalions can be passed off as only a technical oddity . These are patrolmen , and the only thing really necessary is to explain that clearly to the husky young men in the barracks at Kuriharna ? to explain that they never , never must be called soldiers . Not even if they are willing to answer . The creation of this curious police force naturally caused a lot of loose ? and some tense  --  talk in these islands , so a good deal of official explaining was done . During a recent question period in Parliament , Premier Shigeru Yoshida declared that Japanese " can not be permitted " to volunteer in the Korean war . The wording of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later Yoshida said that his government would adhere to the " nowar " constitution and " will reject any command from a foreign power to rearm . " Still more debate followed , and Yoshida finally suggested that the Western powers might consider making Japan " the core of their defense against communism " in Asia if and when the country becomes thoroughly democratized and is regarded as a " reliable ally . " All this parliamen Lary circumlocution did n't do a great deal toward clarification of the situation  --  as is so often the case with official explanations . When the reserve first was organized , drill sergeants found that their squads picked up instructions literally . So intense young Japanese were marching ? with the ineradicable goose step  --  and keeping time in English : " One , two , three , four . " But that , along with other early mistakes , has been corrected . Now on the drill field at Kurihama ? and on others at twenty-eight other camps throughout the Japanese islands  --  the squads march woodenly by , counting in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shi ; ichi , ni , san , shi . " It is a curious and guttural sound when 1000 men make it . Listening , it is easy to imagine that you are hearing the rebirth of a terror which once overran most of Asia or the still-small voice of a new hope for a continent otherwise lost . Or both .
