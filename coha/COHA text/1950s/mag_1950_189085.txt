The German people knew that U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy had recently gone home to discuss Germany 's problems with U.S. officials . They did not know that he would return to Germany with an important policy statement . <P> This week in Stuttgart , McCloy spoke before an audience of 1,400 at the opening of a new Amerika-Haus . His speech was a milestone in the development of the U.S. attitude toward Germany . Said McCloy : <P> " No one ... is charging the Germans with the responsibility for Hitler 's crimes . . . No one demands a beating of the breasts or a scene at Canossa. * But what I do expect is an end to the arguments of those Germans who would not only deny their own guilt , but also seek to place the responsibility for the consequences of that guilt exclusively upon the shortcomings of other peoples ... I want you to know that such utterances . . . call to mind what people are now disposed to forget , that is , the amazing docility and acquiescence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> After this blunt reference to recent statements by German leaders in the dispute with France over the Saarland ( TIME , Feb. 6 ) , McCloy said : " Agitation of foreign issues , however tempting , can not distract attention from vital domestic issues and from the pressing need for domestic reforms . <P> " We Americans are not here exclusively to feed the German people and promote economic recovery . . . Our main purpose is to help Germany achieve political recovery . . . That is my answer to those who occasionally say that we have no right to mix in the political problems confronting this country . " <P> McCloy 's policy program was presented in nine points : <P> 1 ) Germany should be politically integrated into a free Europe . <P> 2 ) Germany should " share fully in free Europe 's economic benefits and correspondingly assume its obligations . " <P> 3 ) " There will be no German army or air force " ; German security is to be protected by cooperation with the rest of Western Europe . <P> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations , should have the widest freedom . . . " <P> 5 ) The U.S. is opposed to the resurgence of those ultranationalistic or anti-democratic forces which might threaten the peace of Europe . <P> 6 ) " All constructive efforts to help toward the goal of the unification of Germany on a democratic and federal basis will be made . " <P> 7 ) The U.S. will continue to aid Berlin . <P> 8 ) The U.S. intends to foster free trade through " decartelization , and deconcentration of industry . " <P> 9 ) The U.S. will see that property confiscated because of " Nazi racial and political discrimination " will be either returned or compensated for . <P> " Germany can readily acquire a position in the world by giving the sign of a regenerated spirit . . . We will work with and support the efforts of those who honestly and sincerely seek to accomplish that purpose . On the other hand , we shall not hesitate to use all our power and influence to expose and counteract any subversive influences which condone or encourage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
