txt The divergences between Western Europe 's military estimates of requirements and civilian estimates of possibilities of payment never have been clearer than at the - nresent time . The failure of the North Atlantic Council to produce a concrete military program for 1953 at its last meeting shadowed the press conference given by Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway Jan , 5 . General Ridgway , in what he called " A new look at old problems , " described his high command 's progress as " highly encouraging , " but " not satisfactory . " The vital task of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe is twofold : To provide that vitally important- factor for the 14 NATO countries , a backing of force for any negotiations and as a deterrent to aggression , as well as to defend all the peoples and lands of the alliance , should such aggression come . The general *said that all the pressing problems confronting SHAPE stem from these two basic tasks . " There is no substantial disagreement on the nature of our military problem , " he continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when certain of them be tackled . " Outside Military Scope These differences of opinion , according to General Ridgway , are in themselves encouraging , but many of them arise from political , economic , financial , and social elements that " are outside the purview of the military command . " " We here at SHAPE , however , are fully conscious of the force of these elements and of the burden that is borne in sharing our vital tasks , " he said . This question of differences between civilian and military views was pointed up by the recent cut of some 50 per cent made by the NATO Council in the military estimates for the fourth slice of the military construction program . Yet when one looks at that slashed program , it is still clear that NATO is doing an enormous amount of vital construction of airfields and roads , port installations and radar stations , jet fuel pipelines and barracks for the forces of the new alliance . The general 's verdict of " highly encouraging " is therefore comprehensible enough , Gap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clarified , The original SHAPE estimates for such programs are worked out in conjunction with the civilian staffs representing the council . One ? would have thought , therefore , that these staffs also were sufficiently informed of the economic and financial position of the various allies to enable the final military program to bear the hallmarks of a combined and hence practical outline of a concrete program . The recent NATO ministerial Council meeting with its postponement of most decisions and its slash in expenditure undoubtedly has left a gap in the steady progress SHAPE has hoped for . Lisbon conference goals for 1953 , tentative it is true , are now so far off the earlier goal that 1953 probably will see some 62 divisions instead of an expected 90 , General Ridgway , whose replies to questions indicated once again his supreme consciousness of being subordinate to civil governments , and his natural diplomacy , neverthe.ess made it avi . dent that he personally is pinning his hopes for further concrete discisions on the spring meeting of the council . -       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
