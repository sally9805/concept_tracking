After four years of retirement and reflection , Clarinetist Artie Shaw was back in the music business last week , at 43 . He mounted the bandstand at Manhattan 's jazz-bent Embers , looked unsmilingly over the jabbering crowd and spoke into the microphone : " Ladies and gentlemen , I 'd like to remind you that it 's almost axiomatic that music sounds better against silence . Not dead silence-just enough so that we can hear ourselves play . " It might have been the old Artie Shaw , the one who called jitterbugs " morons " back in 1939 . <P> The clatter continued , but Shaw turned to the group he calls the Gramercy Five ( nostalgically named after his 1940 recording combo ) , stomped out a beat and began to play . For a while he sounded like a musical D.P. , playing as if he could not decide between his old swing style and something considerably more jittery and " progressive . " He mixed old Shaw favorites ( Begin the Beguine , Frenesi ) with such new Shaw originals as Overdrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the late one , the little band began to perk up . Vibraphonist Joe Roland bent over his instrument like a chef over a hot stove . Guitarist Tal Farlow , who had gazed vaguely into space as he played , began to take an interest in the way his fingers rambled up &; down the fingerboard . Clarinetist Shaw began to interpolate light-hearted musical comments on his own flights-the raised eyebrow of a grace note , the shrugging arpeggio , the delayed take , the impudent echo . His glum face relaxed into smiles , and the crowd began to hear the new Artie Shaw . <P> Artie is , he says , both older and wiser . With his balding head now shaved ascetically , he is far from the distraught young hero who deserted his bandstand and disappeared into Mexico 14 years ago , and far , he says , from the compulsive husband who married and divorced six times. * Part of the change , Artie thinks , came from thinking a lot of things out in a self-analytical autobiography , The Trouble With Cinderella , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.Y . In the book , he described his zooming rise from Manhattan 's Lower East Side to the top of what he called the musical " dung heap , " and bared his confrontation of an ageless question : Where am I ? <P> The mere writing apparently cleared the Shavian atmosphere , and now he speaks quite calmly about his early phobias . " Of course I was contemptuous of the crowds , " he says . " I was so insecure I thought they were yelling for something that was beneath contempt . The same thing goes for my marriages : I felt that any woman who loved me could n't be any good , or she would n't want me . Now I think I can build a real marriage , and I think I am . And now , I can play what people want me to-but I play it the way I feel it . " <P> The well-adjusted Artie came out of his retirement last spring for a brief but money-making tour through the Southwest , and " found myself liking to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , that he is already scheming the way he did in his youth , this time to tour colleges in a double bill with the Gramercy Five and a classical string quartet . " I found I could keep up with what the kids were doing , " he says . " Hell , I was n't sure , you know . Lots of us , as we grow older , find we ca n't . " <P>
