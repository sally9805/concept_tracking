txt COURT GUARANTEES FILMS FREE SPEECH ; ENDS ' MIRACLE ' BAN OPINION UNANIMOUS ' High Tribunal Reverses State Appeals Bench in ' Sacrilege ' Case . OVERTURNS OWN DECISION Denies , as Held 37 Years Ago , That All Motion Pictures Are Business Pure and Simple ' Text of decision and concurring opinion in part , Page 14 . By ** WOOD Strectel to Tam NS. , You , . Tosco . WASHINGTON , May 26 ? The Supreme Court today unanimously decided that motion pictures were entitled to the constitutional guarantees of free speech and a free press . In doing so , the court reversed the New York State Court of Appeals , which had banned the showing of the controversial picture , " The Miracle , " on the ground that it was " sacrilegious . " The picture , which was produced in Italy by Roberto Rosselini , husband of Ingrid Bergman , is the story of a simple-minded Italian peasant woman who is seduced by a stranger she believes to be St. Joseph . She imagines her child is miraculously conceived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position it had held for thirtyseven years . In 1915 the court had ruled in an Ohio . ease that . the exhibition of movies was a " business pure and simple , " and not to be included in the constitutional guarantees . Today the court announced : " We conclude that expression by means of motion pictures is included within the free speech and free press guaranty of the First and Fourteenth Amendments . To the extent that language in the opinion in the Ohio case is out of harmony with the views here set forth , we no longer adhere to it . " " Sacrilegious " Held Indefinite As to " The Miracle , " the nine justices found that the word " sacrilegious " as embodied in the New York law was a vague andandefinite test , too susceptible to various meanings to constitute a satisfactory standard . The court stated : " In seeking to apply the broad and all-inclusive definition of ' sacrilegious ' given by the New York courts , the censor is set adrift upon a boundless sea amid a myriad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those provided by the most vocal and powerful orthodoxies . New York can not vest such unlimited restraining control over motion pictures in a censor ? ' Both rulings for the undivided court were written in a ten-page opinion by Justice Tom C. Clark . An extensive concurrence by Justice Felix Frankfurter , joined by Justices Robert H. Jackson and Harold H. Burton , discussed in detail the definition of " sacrilegious , " and said that students would despair of finding the meaning attributed by the New York court . Opinion Is Bounded While censorship of motion pictures in various states may be affected by the Supreme Court decision , Justice Clark apparently took pains not to outlaw controls of all kinds . " Since , " he wrote , " the term ' sacrilegious ' is the sole standard under attack here in the New York case it is not necessary for us to decide , for example , whether a state may censor motion pictures under a clearly drawn statute designed and applied to prevent the showing of obscene films . " That is a very different question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments a state may not ban a film on the basis of a censor 's conclusion that it is tacrilegious ' . " Justice Clark said also that the guarantees for freedom of speech and a free press did not mean that the Constitution " requires absolute freedom to exhibit every motion picture of every kind at all times and all places . " Clothing the exhibition of motion pictures with the Constitutional pledges brought heart to // film interests that had begged that the Supreme Court take advantage of the case of " The Miracle " to express itself . The impact of the Clark opinion will now be carefully studied to ascertain how far the power of state censorship boards Will continua Argued in the Supreme Court April 24 , the case of " The Miracle " has attracted wide and acute interest . Tne film , anathema to millions of Roman Catholics , Ivas barred from exhibition in New York in February , 1951 . A committee from the New York Board of Regents , Justice Clark related , found there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Court of Appeals held against Joseph Burstyn , Inc. , distributor of the film . At the outset Justice Clark described three points of appeal by Mr. Burstyn . But , the Justice proceeded , the Supreme Court needed to consider only the argument that the New York law " is an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech and . a free press . " The justice recited the history of the Ohlo case and the Supreme Court 's coincident pronouncement that movies were merely " business " enterprises , with no just claim for constitutional protection . Pointing out then that the Supreme Court had constantly extended the barriers against hampering free speech and a free press , he said the case of " The Miracle " was the first affording a chance to include films . He dismissed arguments that motion pictures could not enjoy constitutional protection because they were business enterprises . Likewise , he held that movies should not be barred from these privileges because some persons said the films might sometimes exercise evil influences , Each Expression Different In the opinion , Mr. Clark found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise rules governing any other particular method of expression . " Each method , he continued , tended to present its own peculiar problems . " But the basic principles of freedom of speech and the press , like the First Amendment 's command , do not vary , " he declared . " Those principles , as they have frequently been enunciated by this court , make freedom of expression the rule . There is no justification in this case for making an exception to that rule . " Under such a standard as " sacrilegious , " Justice Clark ruled for the court : " The most careful and tolerant censor would find it virtually impossible to avoid favoring one religion over another , and he would be subject to the inevitable tendency to ban the expression of unpopular sentiments sacred to a religious minority . " Further on , the Justice said that from the standpoint of freedom of speech and the press , " the state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them which is sufficient to justify prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , " he continued , " not the business of Government in our nation to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a particular religious doctrine , whether they appear in publications , speeches , or motion pictures . " Spellman Objections Noted The concurrence by Justice Frankfurter detailed the vigorous objection of Cardinal Spellman of New York to the showing of " The Miracle . " " The vast apparatus of indices and digests , which mirrors our law , affords no clue to a judicial definition of sacrilege , " the concurrence also stated . " Not one case , barring the present , has been uncovered which considers the meaning of the term in any context . " Justice Frankfurter cited " a few examples " to show what difficulties , he said , could face a conscientious censor or motionpicture producer or distributor in determining " what the New York statute condemns as sacrilegious . " These " examples " described how one religious group or another Might be offended by specific details of motion pictures . Concurring in the judgment of the court , Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent states fra setting upl plans to deal with motion pictures . " Assuming , " he said , " that a state may establish a system fort the licensing of motion pictures , an ' issue not foreclosed by the court 's opinion , our duty requires us to e , : amine the facts of the refusal of a license in each case to determine whether the principles of the First Amendment have been honored . This film does not seem to me to be of a character that the First Amendment permits a state to exclude from public view . " Cour Fight Long The Supreme Court 's decision marks the culmination of some two and a half years of legal procedure involving the film , " The Miracle " and film censorship in general through municipal , state and Federal courts . The Italian-made drama starring Anna Magnani as the peasant who is seduced by a stranger whom she believe to be Joseph , opened at , he Paris Theatre here Dec. 11 , 1950 , as part of a tri-partite omnibus feature collectively titled , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were banned Dec. 23 by Edward T. McCaffrey , City License Commissioner , who found the offering " officially and personally blasphemous . " On Dec. 30 Mr. McCaffrey lifted the ban when warned that State Supreme Court Justice Henry Clay Greenberg was about to sign a temporary injunction . Early in January , 1951 State Supreme Court Justice Aaron Steuer ruled that neither the commissioner nor any other municipal officer had the right to interfere with the showing of the film . Cardinal Spellman then called on every Roman Catholic in the United States to boycott the picture and any theatre showing it . The theatre was picketed and the management was notified of several threats to bomb the house . Early in February the license to exhibit the picture was revoked in a unanimous finding by the State Board of Regents on the ground that it was " sacrilegious , " Mr. Burstyn , who was supported in his campaign by various religious and civic groups , brought the issue before the Appellate Division of the State Suprerne Court , which upheld the Board of Regents ' ban . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appeals , after which it was prepared by Ephriam London , Mr. Burstyn 's counsel , for consideration by the United States Supreme Court .
