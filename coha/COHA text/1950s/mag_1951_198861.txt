Tom Dewey went to Washington last week . Officially , he was responding to an invitation from Harry Truman to report on his trip through the Far East . After Dewey 's car had made two wrong turns finding the entrance , he entered the White House for the second time in his life , * spent 40 minutes with the President , and pronounced it " a very pleasant talk . " <P> His statesman 's chore done , it became obvious that Tom Dewey was also on urgent political business . He rushed up to Capitol Hill , got a quick lunch and a round of political handshakes , then headed for the office of Pennsylvania 's Senator James Duff . In the 1948 Republican Convention , Jim Duff had declared bitterly that he was " for anybody but Dewey . " But now the two had one thing in common : they both liked Ike . <P> A Genuine Draft ? To Duff 's office came other Ike men : Massachusetts ' Leverett Saltonstall , New York 's Irving Ives , Kansas ' Frank Carlson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and a talk with Eisenhower , and they discussed his news . <P> As Scott reported it , the conversation had gone like this : he had told Eisenhower , " We are acting without any thought of patronage or reward . . . But we are up against the boys in the political engine room who are offering all kinds of patronage , from postmasterships to U.S. attorneys ' posts to all and sundry who will back their man . " All Scott asked on behalf of Eisenhower supporters was " an assurance that the rug wo n't be pulled out from under their activities by any contrary statement from overseas . ' ' <P> Eisenhower replied indirectly , according to Scott . He said : " I 'm engaged in a terribly important job to myself and the free world . I took that job at considerable personal risk . If there are people at home who feel that a cause is worth pursuing , then they ought to be willing to accept whatever risk is incident to making that fight for that cause . ' ' Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk which speculated that Ike would feel impelled to accept the nomination if a genuine move to draft Ike developed . That article reflected his position , he told Scott . <P> " We 're All For Him . " The conferees knew well that genuine political drafts are not created without heat . They decided that it was time to warm up the campaign . Too many Ike supporters were nervously eyeing the Taft bandwagon , well filled with professionals who have a lot of delegates and a yearning for a " real " Republican who will put on an all-out campaign without " me-tooing " the Fair Deal . Ike supporters needed reassurance , and with Scott 's news , Dewey &; Co. decided they could be given reassurance . Emerging from Duff 's office , Tom Dewey publicly planted himself before the waiting reporters , in the role of chief Ike-booster . Had the talk been about Ike ? Dewey admitted freely that it had . " We are all for him , " said Dewey . What if Ike was too busy to run ? " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jim Duff added a vigorous agreement : " What the hell do you think I 'm doing ? Wasting my time ? " <P> Next day Dewey saw Scott for a long talk , then flew back to New York . Clearly , the campaign for Ike was beginning to roll , and Dewey was pushing it hard .
