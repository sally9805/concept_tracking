txt Following a spectacular exposure today of what he calls a busy bookmaking den at 224 Summer Street , Boston , Dwight S. Strong says Police Station No. 7 in East Boston " is not the only precinct that needs attention . " Mr. Strong is executive secretary of the New England Citizens Crime Commission . He says Boston Police Superintendent Francis J. Hennessy has had information about conditions at the Side Door Caf ? on Summer Street and its nearby betting headquarters since late July when Mr. Strong advised him of the situation in a registered letter , to which he received a prompt reply . " I am absolutely convinced , " says Mr. Strong today , " that we have some good policemen in the Boston police force who are trained and equipped to do something about illegal bookmaking activities . " I feel these men are not being pu . to work and that the top officials are responsible . " No Orders Issued ? In many other cities . Mr. Strong says . police chiefs issue orders that any policeman who observes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of any such order in the Boston Police Department , " he declares . He says his undercover agents have known since last December about what he charges is a flourishing gambling business at the Side Door Cafe . He has photographs taken by a concealed camera with infrared film to document their findings . In Mr. Strong 's July 21 registered letter to Superintendent Hennessy , he said : " We respectfully anticipate in- vestigation and appropriate action to prosecute such large-scale entrenched gambling as appears to exist . .. . " Mr. Hennessy 's July 23 reply stated : " Thank you for your letter of July 21 , 1959 , in which you enclosed a list of alleged bookmaking establishments in Boston . " Please he assured we we-conic receipt of this information in order that investigation may be made and appropriate action taken by this department . " Mr. Strong indicates that both his agents and plainclothes policemen observed during the following days brisk gaming business at the designated area . However , he says that to his knowledge " before or after Superintendent Hennessy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been closed for one working day . " Other Centers Cited Mr. Strong says that his July 21 letter included the names and addresses of " several places " in the South Station area where he charges that smaller gaming activities are going on . " So if police want to do something about it , " he says . " they have got other places they can work on . " The whole picture of illegal gambling which has sprung to light since last Friday 's raid by United States Internal Revenue Service agents on what they term East Boston bookie centers. says Mr. Strong , suggests the necessity for corrective legislation . As iL now stands in Boston , he says , the police commissioner is not a police officer and if there is failure to enforce the law . he can not he held responsible . " This , I think , " says Mr. Strong . " should be changed to make him officially and legally responsible . " His second recommendation is to remove authority from the Governor to appoint the Boston police commissioner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause the commissioner to be responsible to the Mayor . Bet Placed Yesterday ? In this way , the budget of the Police Department would be subject to the Mayor and the city council as are budgets of other city departments , he says . For nearly a year Commissioner Sullivan has resisted City Council efforts to control his budget . Yesterday afternoon the commissioner announced top-tobottom changes in the East Boston Station No. 7 . He also established a new unit at headquarters to fight gambling throughout the city . While this was going on in his office , a local news reporter was placing a horse bet at the Side Door Caf ? , according to the Bocton Herald today . Mr. Strong says he hopes police officials will do more than just create a special squad to work out of headquarters . He was at the Side Door Caf ? at 6:30 this morning and reports that bookie operations there appear to be " cleaned up . " He says he hopes this is permanent and not just cessation for a couple of weeks . He says " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect that the police will do something about this on a continuing basis .
