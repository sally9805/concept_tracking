With every American and most of the world 's citizens , we were keenly distressed to learn of the President 's illness and join in the hope for his early and full recovery . There is , however , one aspect of the President 's ill ? ness on which we dissent from the outpouring of - press , ? radio and TV comment . On all sides it is said that the illness could not have occurred at a more desperate time : there are the NATO meeting in Paris , the missile race , the messages to be prepared for Congress , the conferences with Congressional leaders , the budget and a host of other pressing matters . To make things worse , three of the President 's " strongest " advisers ( Humphrey , Wilson and Brownell ) have left the Cabinet . The moved most commentators to voice demands for " action , " strong leadership and special " team work " expedients to make up for Mr. Eisenhower 's absence . But is there ever " a good time " for the President to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any time its occupant is ill or out of the country or unable , for any reason , to bring his maximum powers to bear on the problems requiring his attention , it is unfortunate and can , of course , be dangerous . But we reject the sugges ? tion that at this moment a " crisis " exists of such magnitude as to require extraordinary measures . Of the various reasons cited to prove that such an emergency does exist , the pending NATO meeting appears to be the most compelling . But is it imperative that the meeting be held on December 16 ? Is it even ? desirable ? For weeks , now , we have been told that the ? Administration has not shaped up a program , that the policy-makers are faced with a cruel deadline . We have been told , too , that the Administration is " shopping for ideas . " By clear inference we have been told that the American delegation would probably have to " play by ear " in Paris . In other respects , also , the timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neville Chamberlain has a British ' Prime Minister suffered such a disastrous decline in prestige as Harold Macmillan has experienced in the last three months ; seldom has one commanded ? so little respect at home or abroad . On the evidence of recent by-elections , the Tories have lost the support of the electorate but , at the same time , the Labor opposition has failed to put forward a convincing alternative program . France has another caretaker government , weak , , insecure , vexed by problems . West Germany 's frigid reaction to Mr. George Kennan 's proposal for military neutralization of a reunited Germany is another indication that the present might not be the best time to hold a NATO meeting . As to the missiles race , The Nation is opposed to " crash " programs , which would only add to existing tensions , without first exploring the ' possibilities of negotiation . Nor is there any apparent reason why we should try to reach the moon before Christmas . What we need , abbve all , is a new policy . New policies seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-war period , American policy has too . otten been improvised to meet some " crisis " of the moment . Now is ' not the time for action , but for stock-taking , reassessment , a restatement of goals and objectives . We need a new program for peace , not an intensification of cold-war military policies . Nor are the domestic problems , urgent as they are , of a character that require emergency action .. While there is no crisis at the moment of a gravity that requires desperate expedients , it is always possible that hysterical comment might conjure such a crisis into being . To the President 's other burdens should not be added the task of coping with a national semi-hysteria precipitated by those who simply repeat what everyone is saying as well as by those who seem sincerely to feel that the times justify panic . In short , the emergency is less the President 's illness  --  grave as that is  --  than the possibility that his condition might engender , or be used to manipulate , a national mood of fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists . Time for a Turn On all sides there is evidence of impending change in key national policies ; witness the willingness to increase defense spending , to lift the debt ceiling if necessary , to ease fiscal restrictions as by cutting the discount rate , to resurvey defense needs , to take up the question of federal aid to education , to place more emphasis on basic-science research , and so forth . Struggling hard to capture the new mood , editorial writers have been putting a severe strain on familiar terms . In some quarters , the mood is characterized as a " national turnaround " ; in others it is called a " turnabout . " Apparently there is an attempt to suggest more a willingness to change than any actual radical shift in direction , to imply that the changes which impend are somehow more significant than any specific developments in the post-Sputniki- weeks would indicate . For example , we are told that the pew mood is not to be measured in terms of dollars or brawn but is , instead , " a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the new mood implies a general willingness to consider alternative policies , it ' is a hopeful sign ; turnabout or turnaround , it really does n't matter , so long as there is a general recognition of the need for a turn . What is needed is a policy , a plan and a program for peace . If , as Mr. C. L. Sulzberger has pointed out in a series of penetrating columns in The New York T211161 , it is indeed time for a change in policy , if we have " allowed our policy to become synonymous with anti-communism " ? which is , of course , no policy at all  --  then we commend C. WrightMills 's article ( page 419 ) in this issue . If the Administration is really " shopping about for ideas , " here is a packaged program that makes sense . Dream of an Egghead Among the proposals which Edward Teller made to the Senate Preparedness subcommittee last week was the long-range one of developing in the public a more respectful attitude toward the nation 's scientists ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as " highbrow " curiosities . Mr. Teller is right  --  we should stop laughing at our great brains  --  but meanwhile the great brains themselves do little to earn our serious attention . The week before Mr. Teller spoke , eight of our ' leading scientists ( the group included two Nobel Prize winners ) met at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York to help celebrate the centenary of Seagram 's whiskey by forecasting what the world will be like a hundred years from now . As they see , it , we shall be able to pick the sex of our children and decide whether we want them singly or in litters ; there will be no disease of any kind ; we shall eat vegetable steak and it will be delicious ; earth satellites will deliver the mail ; there will be gambling joints in outer space ; gifted individuals will contribute their seed to sperm banks for the improvement of future generations ; all physical labor will be performed by machines ; we can live much longer , if that is thought desirable . But how shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our neighbors , what ideals shall wehonor , what beauty shall we see , what gods shall we worship and what will the words " love , " " truth " and " honor " mean to that generation of super-gadgeteers ? The scientists do not say , and would probably protest with some show of righteousness that these are not matters about which they are competent to speculate . Perhaps not , but Mr. Teller says that we must respect them , and how can you respect men who do not immediately think in such terms when the future is proposed to them ? The future of the human race resides in its humanity , not in its ability to construct honeymoon motels on Venus . And until our scientific geniuses get that through their superior heads , they have earned no more than our amused curiosity . Angry Man Mayor George ' Christopher , of San Francisco , is an angry man . On the basis of three separate assurances from Governor Goodwin Knight that the field was clear , Christopher announced himself as a Republican candidate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , the blow came : Knight himself became a candidate and Christopher was left with his big-money support gone . " A stab in the back , " the Mayor called it . After a hasty return and a quick consultation with advisers ( who advised him to get out ) , he decided to make a fight for it . The announcement was less of a surprise than its phrasing : The average voter has been let down by a few people calling the shots from the back room . It has disillusioned the members of the Republican Party . It 's about time those few people started to consider they are reckoning with a man who makes up his own mind . I would be violating every tenet of good , decent government if I let that small group dictate to me . . . . I will go up and down the state ? . . . and tell the people the truth about some things that have n't been brought out yet . If this would ruin the Republican Party , it is their decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of candidates in this state , it is time they learned about it . Glaring at reporters , the Mayor added : " They have ? stripped everybody involved in this of his personal dignity . I would lose mine as well if I were to withdraw now . " - One reads these words with wonder . " Makes up his own mind , " " tell the people the truth , " and especially " personal dignity , " are phrases one had forgotten might be associated with a Republican from California . Mr. Meany 's Brinkmanship With the crusading enthusiasm of a Carry Nation , Mr. George Meany continues to purge unions from the roster of AFL-CIO . At present unions with a total membership of three and a half million  --  almost a fourth of the total claimed by the federation  --  have been fingered as likely prospects for ultimate expulsion . Nor should it be forgotten that perhaps a million organized workers were outside AFL-CIO when the merger took place . Now , no one suggests that Mr. Meany should condone unethical practices ; The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took cognizance of them . But a word of caution seems appropriate . If Mr. Meany continues to act as though each disclosure of corruption confronted him with but one option , namely , to purge the offending union , we predict - that he will thin the ranks of the AFL-CIO to a degree that he does not anticipate . Some evidence of corruption or other unethical practices can be discovered in many more unions than have been investigated to date , and the disclosures may be expected to continue as long as Mr. Meany is willing to act as a disciplinary arm of the McClellan committee . This is not , we suggest , the way to strengthen democratic practices in labor unions or to fight corruption . Somehow one suspects that Mr. Meany is the victim of a fallacy embedded in the Code of Ethical Practices adopted by AFL-CIO . A more modest approach would have been to define certain " unethical practices " which would not be tolerated , rather than to set forth a code which ambitiously undertakes " to protect the labor movement from all corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick reflexes are being exploited to weaken the labor movement  --  and not , it need scarcely be added , by those who have the best interests of that movement at heart .
