The Gump family have been galumphing along in their daily comic strip for over 30 years . They first appeared in the Chicago Tribune . Chinless , blowhard Andy Gump , his long-suffering , last-wording wife Min , and their billionaire Uncle Bim became as familiar to millions of newspaper readers as the neighbors , and Andy 's anguished cry for help ( " O , Mini " ) was a byword of the ' 30s . When a minor character called Mary Gold was heartlessly killed off ( the first U.S. comic-strip figure to die ) , thousands of readers protested . <P> The Gumps were conceived , named ( after a favorite family expression , " Do n't be a gump " ) and lovingly nursed by the late Captain Joseph M. Patterson , publisher of the New York Daily News and president of the Tribune-News syndicate . For turning out the immensely popular strip , the syndicate paid Cartoonist Sidney Smith a record $150,000 a year . The Gumps survived Smith 's death in 1935 ( Cartoonist Gus Edson has drawn it ever since ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a number of newspapers dropped the strip . <P> Last month the Chicago Tribune evicted The Gumps from their original home . To replace them , Publisher Bertie McCormick , who mortally hates and fears the British , last week was running a comic strip from London 's Sunday Graphic . The newcomer : Artist William Timym 's Caesar , the wordless adventures of a dog of dubious paternity.
