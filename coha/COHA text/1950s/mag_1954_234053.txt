Night driving is risky enough , warns St. Louis ' Dr. Paul W. Miles in the Archives of Ophthalmology , but colored glasses or tinted windshields can make it downright dangerous . The big trouble : the loss of visual acuity because too much light is cut out . <P> Taking plain and colored glass in turn . Dr. Miles lists their effects . If ordinary daytime vision is 20/20 , then visual acuity at night , through clear glass , is cut to 20/32 . A popular " night glass " of light yellow reduces visual acuity only to 20/34 . But Dr. Miles found that a second popular shade , pink , cut visual acuity to 20/40 . Finally , a green windshield reduced nighttime acuity to 20/46 , but in combination with the pink glasses , it slashed vision to a deadly 20/60 . <P> Dr. Miles 's advice : green filters for sun glare should be lifted out of the way at night , and colored glasses should be left in the glove compartment .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
