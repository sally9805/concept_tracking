One night during his conducted tour through Communist China , Editor Frank Moraes of the Times of India was kept awake by mosquitoes . " You know , Chang , " he said playfully to his interpreter , " the mosquitoes . . . sucked my blood . From today I shall call them landlords . " <P> " No , " retorted Chang somberly . " Call them American aggressors . " <P> Everywhere Moraes went as one of India 's cultural delegation to China , the story was the same , he wrote last week in the New York Times . <P> From the seemingly sagest adults to the small children , reported Editor Moraes , the bloodstream of China has been seriously infected with the propaganda germs spread daily from Peking : " America is Public Enemy No. 1 . From billboards and posters , through the press , film and radio , in incessant speeches and slogans , the U.S. is reviled as an imperialist and an aggressor . Even the mild-mannered Madame Sun Yat-sen chuckled with glee when drawing our attention to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacterial bug . ' " Moraes noted that Chinese who speak English with an American accent are nervous about where they got their education ; he met one Columbia-educated Chinese interpreter who , while favoring American-style clothes and flaunting an American fountain pen , carefully made it clear that she had " hated every minute " of her stay in the U.S. <P> Moraes found the Chinese Communists ' propaganda about American bacteriological warfare in Korea to be " clever and not ineffective . " Since the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan , he wrote , " Asian opinion has been particularly sensitive to the use of unorthodox weapons of war " and susceptible to the belief that the Americans are now using other Asians-the Communists in Korea - as guinea pigs for another horrible weapon . The Peking germ-warfare exhibition fills three large halls , with exhibits of parachuted cylinders allegedly full of germ-carrying insects , and maps showing where the Americans dropped pests 804 times at 70 points . An American-made phonograph plays over &; over the " confessions " of two captured U.S. airmen . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , " Editor Moraes decided , " are the twin props of Communism .
