txt The powerful Democratic organization of Hudson County is preparing for what is tantamount to a revolt against the leadership of Gov . Robert B. Meyner . An influential county leader explained today that a " showdown " with the Governor may be expected momentarily . He attributed the situation to Mr. Meyner 's " indifference " toward the wishes of party leaders on the county level . The Governor 's failure to provide ample patronage and other policies promulOated by him , the county leader added , are important contribut-1 ing factors . A similar undercurrent of party dissension , less uronounced than in Hudson , is rapidly rising , to the surface in many other , counties , including Essex and , Mercer . Before long , ' political observers believe , it is bound to result in a test of the Governor 's strength within the party . He has repeatedly made it clear that he is the undisputed leader of New Jersey Democrats . However , twice in the last two weeks he suffered rebukes at the hands of his own party .

Mr. Meyner , although not present , had repeatedly pleaded that no such plank be inserted . Discussing the convention , a member of the party 's high command declared today : " I think John Kenny Hudson County leader was serving notice on Meyner and George Brunner state chairman that they had better listen to Hudson . I 've never seen a steamroller operating in the open before . It was definitely a show of Hudson strength . " The Hudson spokesman stressed that his county organization would hereafter take a stand on all major issues independent of any policies laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " is going to support immediate state aid to schools whether Mr. Meyner likes it or not . Hud- son County has been quiet long enough . Now we are going to act and act in Hudson County fashion . " Asked if the county was irked because of a lack of state patronage , he replied , " The Governor has no patronage problem , becaus ! he does n't give any patronage . " Of the twenty Democrats in the Assembly , nine are from Hudson . Two prominent county leaders voiced opposition to the rebellion in party ranks and sought to minimize its importance . They pointed out , as has the Governor , that his slowness in making appointments was designed to assure that only qualified men would be selected . They also emphasized that the failure of party leaders to " bury their gripes " and to follow the leadership provided by the Governor might well result in Democratic defeats at the November elections .
