We made it all right , But the Great Danes were seven feet tall when they stood up , and they had four legs . The news photos showed me on my knees with a leash around my neck , barking back at the dogs and the inevitable bevy of pretty girls . The girls were holding off the four-footed Danes and my press agent was holding me , It was a draw . No one got so much as a nip . But three days later I was in bed with a skin rash , and when a specialist examined ma , he said , " Victor , you 've got a dog rash . You 're one of those rare people who are allergic to Great Danes . " To this day even the words " Great Dane " make me itch . The daily routine in our Danish home was far different from what it is in almost any American family today . I am sure there are thousands of American boys and girls rebelliously plunking a piano or sawing away on a violin because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the music in our house was not there as a duty or a social veneer . It was a presence . You could feel it . My family lived in a six-room flat in an old stone building . The street was solid with these brick and granite battlements , much as you see them in the Bronx now , and the neighboring families were store and office workers , government employees or perhaps people who owned a little business . My father , Bernhard , who was 62 when I was born , was a stocky , patrician man with soft white hair and an imposing white mustache . His life , and ours , too , was dedicated to the masters of music  --  Liszt , Wagner , Mozart , Beethoven and the others  --  and their portraits lined the wall of his oak-paneled study . He taught violin and viola  --  Viola learned fast , too -- and he was active in the Royal Opera Orchestra almost to the day of his death . My mother , Frederikke , a kind , happy and remarkably busy woman until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished pianist , and often played duets with my father . I have been told that I began pecking at the keys when I was two years old , and my parents soon decided that I had a marked talent for music . In fact , the marks still show . They let me pound the piano whenever I wished , and my mother taught me to sing a few simple little Dan ish folk songs . One day my father came home with a tiny violin . " Here , Victor , " he said , " I will show you that you can also make lovely music with a violin . Hold it the way I do . " He tuned his own violin , tucked it under his chin and began to play very slowly . " You see , " he said with a paternal smile , " it is quite easy . " " But , father , " I said , " you flatted one of those notes . " My father lowered his violin . His face turned red and his mustache bristled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been playing this instrument for fifty years , and I wo n't have a five-year-old boy correcting me . Now get out ! " I did n't stop to argue . I ran from the room and I never touched a violin again until the day Yehudi Menuhin came to play in Copenhagen . I did n't have a ticket and I could n't afford to buy one . So I borrowed my father 's violin case , after carefully removing the instrument , and went to the stage door of the concert hall . " Orchestra , " I said . They let me in , but during the intermission they counted heads and threw me out . My father retrieved his violin case and said sarcasti tally , " Next time try getting in with an empty piano crate . " But I loved the piano , and within a year I was studying with Olivo Krause , of the Royal Music Conservatory . My father eventually saw the humor and the justness of my brash remark about his off-pitch note , and when the Copenhagen newspapers interviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , " It has made me very happy in my old age to hear my son play , If he keeps at it he may turn into a pianist after all , " There may be a few people around the country who , after watching me perform , will conclude I did n't keep at it , Dictionaries plainly define a pianist as one who plays the piano . I usually play the piano very well . I have been known to start and finish a composition . But the other things I do with pianos are n't mentioned in dictionaries . I have seen them defined in newspaper music reviews , but those gentlemen have their opinions and I have mine , What I want to say is this : I do n't think any pianist or any entertainer in the world has had more fun with pianos than Victor Borge . The piano is really a marvelous instrument and few ? ( Ckwriouted front Page 63 ) people aPPrecitftits versatility . it 's very useful for boiling eggs , for instance . I just play the Minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first talking piano . The piano had a thick Germanaccent and I carried on conversations with it every night during a long run at the Waldorf in New York . Both voices were mine , of course . The guttural Barge voice came from a tape recording inside the piano , andi had it timed so the pauses were long enough for me to talk back . A few ill-tempered piano teachers said I should n't have done this to the instrument of the immortals , but I said I was only trying to explain what happened to Weber and Fields . Over the years I 've played pianos standing , sitting and lying down . I have attacked them  --  or so it is said  --  with fingers , knuckles and elbows , but I usually play with two hands because it goes faster that way . In Pittsburgh once I was bitten by a piano . The music rack clamped down on my fingers and the wound took two weeks to heal . I had a lot of fun with this subject one evening when my friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him I could even tell time with a piano . " Ridiculous , " he said . " Wait , Basil , " I said . " I 'll demonstrate . " I leaned over the piano and banged out a few crashing bars from a Sousa march . Suddenly there was a thunderous pounding on the wall of the adjoining room , and a man 's voice growled , " Stop that noise , you idiot ! Do n't you know it 's one-thirty in the morning ? " I turned to Basil and said , " You can set your watch by that . " Later on , we turned this incident into a skit for one of my radio shows , and it 's been used by other performers now and then . I learned long ago that pianos are not the same everywhere . I have played pianos in Kansas and Colorado that must have been hauled there by oxcart . I sat down in front of a beautiful white piano in Cleveland not long ago , played one cadenza and had the name plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in Berlin to play for American troops , no one could find a bench . The soldiers made one for me in their shop . In Zanesville , Ohio , the theater people supplied a bench obviously built for a midget . I sat on eight copies of The Saturday Evening Post and just did reach the keyboard . That Steinway was so ancient that I ad-libbed , " This piano was made by Steinway and Sons ' father . " The quip drew such a roar that I have used it regularly ever since , The gag , that is , not the piano . I bought a moving van not long ago and now my own piano goes where I go . All this was not what my father had in mind , I 'm sure , when he paid for my lessons . My boyhood was a consuming apprenticeship in traditional music . There was a crisis now and then , but I never felt chained nor could I say , as other artists have complained belatedly , that I was robbed of the fun of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imagined that I was one of my favorite conductors . Toscanini , perhaps , or Bruno Walter . I had an old crystal radio with a headset , and when a symphony or an opera was to be broadcast , I got the score out of my own library and had it ready . had my own baton , and sometimes I was there for hours , scolding the drummer for missing a cue , rapping the oboist on the knuckles or , in one instance , heaving an ash tray at the flute player when he got a little behind , It barely missed my brother , who was sitting in a chair with no instrument , pretending to be the first violinist , This was vivid make-believe , indeed , but before I was fifteen I had memorized the scores of some twelve operas and symphonies . Looking back on that period now , my mind seems like one of those new television cameras which can show four or five scenes simultaneously . In one corner I can see my mother scurrying around a schoolyard trying to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize me because I had been doing an imitation of Al Jolson , one of my early heroes , and had smeared my face with black shoe polish . In a second corner of my screen I can see my father coming home and finding me warming my hands over a roaring fire . That made him very angry , because we did n't have a fireplace . Another view might cover the somewhat frantic day when 1 dropped a pail filled with ice on my index finger , and for a while my parents thought I might lose it . The doctor came and Left two kinds of pills  --  one for pain and the other for sleep . Late one evening , when the pain seemed terribly acute , I reached out in the dark and swallowed all the sleeping tablets . My mother , who was working in the kitchen , had a psychic feeling that something was wrong . She found me turning blue in the bedroom and got me to the hospital in a hurry . The doctor pumped out the drug and told my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have been dead . " My older brother , Sven , who is sitting across from me as I tell this story , has his own disrespectful postscript for this incident . " Too bad , " he says . " I would have been the sole heir . " But in this case even trouble taught me something . The doctor suggested to my mother , as delicately as he could , that I had probably tried to commit suicide with the sleeping pills . He sent me to a farm sanitarium specializing in nervous breakdowns , and there , for the first time . I encountered ( a ) psychiatrists and ( b ) chickens . When I saw what a chicken could do all by itself  --  and this is certainly something for people to think about  --  I decided that someday 1 would have a farm of my own . Now that I have a farm in Connecticut , I wonder if I should n't have stuck with the psychiatrists and let the chickens mind their own business . I remembered the Danish psychiatrists years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . Maybe it had something to do with my assets . My books show that I took in $90.358.87 in 1949 and that when the year ended I had exactly $391.72 cash in the bank , That was enough to depress anybody . Then along came Stan Anderson , of the Cleveland Press , with a column lamenting the fact that I did not have a radio or television show of my own , He bracketed me with Abe Burrows and said , " Maybe ABC and NBC will need forgotten men like these . " I was as blue as Kentucky grass . Somebody up there most love me , I said . Finally one of my well-balanced friends in the radio business came to the house one night and said , " Victor , you do n't need ABC or NBC . What you need is psychiatric help . " " No , " I said . " What I need is CBS . " I was then living in Chatsworth , north of Hollywood , along with such other forgotten people and neighbors as Lucille Ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was mayor of Chatsworth , and one of the privileges of the office was getting cheery letters from pretty fellow politicians like Mayor Ann Blyth , of Toluca Lake . I had nothing to lose except my mind , and I had already lost that , so I made an appointment with an expensive Los Angeles psychiatrist . I survived a couple of sessions , and then the doctor said , hand ing me a bill , " There 's nothing I can do for you , Victor . But oh , boy , what you 've done for me ! " 1 have n't consulted a psychiatrist since , no matter what you may have heard to the contrary . It is probably unnecessary to add that since that first experience in Copenhagen I have also shied away from sleeping pills . I 'd rather stay awake . From time to time , as I travel around the United States , friends and strangers both ask me at what point I first added humor to my piano performances . Actually there was a series of precipitating incidents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously ill with a high fever . On a doctor 's advice , my mother had put me in a bathtub of ice water to reduce my temperature , When the doctor came , he put a stethoscope on my chest and said , " Victor , I want to listen to your lungs . I want you to say thirty-three . " I said it , and the doctor h'm'm'm'med to himself . " Now say thirty-three twice , " he said . " Sixty-six , " I said . He jammed the stethoscope into his pocket and gave my mother a dour look . " I did n't know you had a comedian in the family , " he said . " 1 guess he 'll live no matter what you do . " My father , who had puckish qualities of his own , used to take me along when he visited sick friends in the hospitals . " You seem to have a gift for making people laugh , " he said . " and that 's good medicine . " In school the students invariably chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expense . In the Copenhagen boys ' clubs I was usually the idea man for all sorts of skits , burlesques , monologues and other forms of entertainment . I soon learned a basic principle of humor . I did n't know exactly why people howl when you fail into a mud puddle or have your face plastered with custard pie . It has been suggested that we feel embarrassment for the victim and that our laughter really reflects sympathy . Others say that a lot of us have a cruel streak and use ridicule as a weapon . I found that neither is true . Humor habits . The late Percy Grainger unwittingly learned this at a concert some years ago in Scranton , Pennsylvania . He strode on stage that evening , glanced at the piano and frowned when he saw that the instrument was not placed at the angle he liked . He clutched one corner of the piano and lifted it with straining muscles . He got it up an inch or two and suddenly one of the legs fell off . Grainger stared at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The audience was convulsed , and there was pandemonium until the stage hands , momentarily hypnotized by this disaster , rushed out and replaced the leg . Patrick Flannery , an attorney friend of mine in Wilkes-Barre who was there , reports that Grainger recovered his aplomb and never had a more responsive audience in his life , I wonder if it later occurred to Grainger that the accident was an unexpected but welcome informality and therefore enormously humorous , I must admit that my first experience with this kind of fun was also accidental , and painful . I was invited to a dance of some social significance , and one of those present would be a certain girl . I wanted to impress her , and I was wearing my first dinner jacket . I was running for a streetcar when a taxi swished past and spattered me with winter slush . It was too late to turn backt:and so I went on to the party and sat miarosely in the kitchen trying to wipe my muddy clothes . Before long , the girl found me there  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Why , Victor , you 're a mess . " " No , I 'm not , " I blurted . " It 's just make-up . I 'm going to tell a story on the piano , about a musician who drank too much and became a great symphony conductor . Tell me when you 're ready . " I went through with this impromptu skit , and apparently other youngsters were not only convinced but convulsed . It was the first ad-lib performance of my career and the fat , or maybe it was the ham , was in the fire . I have since decided that the art of ad-libbing is like having a loaded gun in your hand when a thug comes up with a slingshot and demands your money . I am not often caught unarmed . Indeed , I faced one situation in which the wrong quip could have been awkward , I was playing the Wedgwood Room at the Waldorf one winter evening when a waiter slipped me a note which read : " Lauritz Melchior and Jean Hersholt both at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big names from the stage because it breaks up the timing of my show , Moreover , if you mention one celebrity 's name and overlook another , you are tactless . In this instance , however , both visitors were old friends and fellow Danish-Americans , and I solved it by saying : " I have the privilege of introducing two great Danish artists whose talent has given so much pleasure to millions of Americans . I honestly do n't know in what order to introduce them , So , I 'm sure that Jean Hersholt wo n't mind if I mention Lauritz Melchior first . " It was an earlier ad-lib of sorts that marked my first public performance as a pianist and showed which way the twig was bent . Or cracked , if you like , I had been studying four years or so with the famous pianist , Victor Schibler , and one day he greeted me with overwhelming news . I - was being given the honor of playing the Rachmaninoff C Minor Piano Concerto with the Copenhagen Philharmonic Orchestra , and Schibler was naturally anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then fourteen years old and , I must say , unabashedly confident . But i do n't know what got into me the night of the performance . I was doing very well in the second movement when I came to a long trill , played with two fingers in the upper register . I looked over at the string section and saw a bunch of old men furiously carving away on their violins . There were a couple of thousand people in the audience , and I imagined how they had rushed home from work , scrubbed their hands and faces , struggled into their stiff black suits and climbed on crowded streetcars for a cultural evening , Half of them were falling asleep , and the other half sat gravely , like witnesses at an execution . It suddenly dawned on me that the whole thing was extremely funny . I winked at the first row , and some of the women tittered . The conductor , a solemn , gray-haired man named Schnedler Petersen , heard this unseemly sound and nervously stepped up the beat . The orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripple of laughter . I stopped playing , got up from the bench and walked over to the podium . I turned Petersen 's score back three pages , returned to the piano and continued . The auditorium exploded and the concert ended on a higher note than even Rachma ninon had dreamed of , Even at fourteen those bursting bubbles of laughter were intoxicating , and thereafter , as much as I loved good music , I could never again be completely serious during a concert . Perhaps Comedy in Music , as I later called my Broadway show , was born that night . As I reconsider this escapade I conclude that I am a man of impulse . And a man who has n't yielded to an impulse now and then is no man at all . You may achieve immortality , or you may be the forgotten man of 1949 , as I was , but the odds are in favor of a gain . i 've been wanting to pass along this advice to Gov . George M. Leader , of Pennsylvania , and this seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hershey , Pennsylvania , last spring for five nights , during which time we took in 545,000 for a new box-office record . We drew more customers than South Pacific , which also had packed houses , but I did n't have a big company , and so I was able to put 300 seats on the stage . I made some mocking remarks about my being in Her-she , a female town , and said I was going to round up some pioneers and start a rival community for men called He-him . After opening night I received this letter from Governor Leader : Dew- Mr. Borge : Last esening my wife , some friends and myself were priyileged to be part of your audience in " Her-she , " a female town . It was one of the most pleasant evenings we have spent for quite awhile . I controlled my desire to go backstage to meet you , for 1 knew anyone who must sustain such a pitch of wonderful humor five nights a week , with a few matinees included , deserves all the solitude he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come back to friends . I Sincerely yours , GEORGE M. LEADER Gosernor P. S. : I 've been a poultryman most of my life and I will enjoy learning about " Cornish Hens " someday . Frankly , I wish Governor Leader had surrendered to his desire to come backstage and hear more of my sustained pitch . I 'm a poultryman too . I raise Cornish hens in Connecticut . I sell them under the trade name of ViBo . There must be lots of people in Pennsylvania who 've never eaten a Connecticut Rock Cornish hen . Who knows , maybe I would have taught the Governor our secrets in raising the world 's finest Rock Cornish hens , and made him a competitor ! In that case , I 'm sure the ancestors of our prize stock would have turned over in their gravies . When I bought Vibo Farms in Southbury , Connecticut , an old-time poultryman said to me , " Borge , you 're crazy . What do you know about raising Cornish hens ? " " Nothing , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I suppose that many men through necessity must control their impulses . What they do must be done with finesse and what they say must be expressed with delicacy and consideration . It is like a doctor who finds himself obligated to tell a patient of a serious illness or a hypochondriac there is nothing wrong . In either case , whatever the doctor 's impulse , he must color his story to make the truth more attractive . Having followed my impulses in this way brought me to the point where on December II of last year I received a check for 5150,000 for a one-hour solo appearance on television . And that was , as the famed columnist Earl Wilson quipped , " without answering one question . " However , you must realize my disappointment when 1 learned that another performer by the name of Needles made 5123,450 for two minutes , three and two-tenths seconds at the Kentucky Derby . But it is not for one hour or for two minutes that the money is paid . It is for a lifetime of accomplishments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needles . The same is true in becoming successful in any field . Although I have played the Cotton Bowl in Dallas and Soldier Field in Chicago , I have never played the famous Derby in Kentucky . So you see . I still have far to go . There was one other urge  --  I ca n't call it an impulse because it did not come on the spur of the moment  --  and it is perhaps the most important of all . I had always wanted to go to America . It took me thirty-one years . And , as grim as it may sound , I probably would not have done it without the help of disaster . I believe there are times when a man is born , and then reborn . For , as I have said before , I was really born on August 28 , 1940 , the day I arrived in New York as Victor Borge , musical immigrant .
