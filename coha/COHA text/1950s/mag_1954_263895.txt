A standard chore in biological laboratories is weighing the experimental animals ( e.g. , mice and guinea pigs ) to record their rate of growth . Biologist David Marshall Prescott , 27 , of the University of California does this chore too , but his experimental animals are amoebas , and they weigh only ten billionths of a gram each . <P> The weighing is done in a complicated apparatus whose essential part is a tiny glass tube closed at one end and trapping a bubble of air . When this " Cartesian diver " is properly weighted , it floats midway in a column of water , and slight changes in water pressure can make it sink or rise by compressing its bubble . <P> To put an amoeba on his scale , Dr. Prescott waits until one of his stock has just divided into two new individuals . Working with a powerful microscope , he picks one of them up with a hairlike suction tube and delicately transfers it to a minute cup on top of the Cartesian diver . It can not escape , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By measuring the pressure that will keep the underwater Cartesian diver on the zero line , Dr. Prescott can weigh his captive amoeba at all stages of growth . When the amoeba has doubled in weight , it generally divides into two " daughters . " <P> Dr. Prescott is the first to weigh the growth of individual amoebas , but he is not tending his microscopic livestock as a mere stunt . He has already discovered something new : that amoebas generally grow for about 20 hours . Then for the next four hours before they divide , their weight does not increase . This scrap of information , gathered so laboriously , is considered important in the study of cellular growth , including the growth of cancer cells in the human body .
