After his first major TV appearance , John Cameron Swayze eagerly phoned his wife Tuffie . " How did I look ? " he asked breathlessly . Said Turner " Like you were dead . " A bit dismayed , Swayze got rid of most of the television make-up he had been wearing , added a toupee to thicken out his sparse thatch , set himself to cultivating an air of friendly animation . In three years , these simple measures have helped to propel brisk , 45-year-old Newsaster Swayze into a bigger-than-TV prominence . His Camel News Caravan weekdays , 7:45 p.m. , NBCTV ) now has an audience of some 5,000,000 , rates as one of the liveliest news shows on television . Each 15-minute program begins with Commentator Swayze 's crisp delivery of he latest news bulletins . As he talks , the camera may switch to an animated war map , or a newsreel film of U.S. troops in action . Sometimes there is a quick jump to Washington , London or Rome for filmed shots of political headliners and recorded interviews . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Seville to Seoul-the show goes to Chicago for the weather forecast with the help of a big weather map . Most of the background tricks are no novelty to TV audiences . What gives Camel News the edge is smooth production and Commentator Swayze 's knack of tying the whole show together . <P> Never Say No . His job on Camel News is only one of John Cameron Swayze 's many current enterprises . An ex-newspaperman ( Kansas City Journal-Post ) and radio newscaster , he first made his mark in 1948 , during the presidential conventions in Philadelphia . TV was then still feeling its way and cordially welcomed a commentator like Swayze , who was both durable and willing ( " I never said no to anything " ) . From the solid success of Camel News , he moved on to become a permanent panel member of NBC 's Who Said That ? ( Mon. 10:30 p.m. ) , where he dazzles his audience with a seemingly encyclopedic memory of current hews events . <P> Actually , Swayze is more eager beaver than elephant . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times and the news weeklies avidly , clips whatever seems interesting and restudies his quotes before going on the air . On Sundays , he acts as M.C. of another NBC-TV show called Watch the World , a series of filmed subjects aimed at children . <P> Never a Pundit . Swayze is also getting some belated recognition from the two mediums in which he worked for 20 years . Early this year , McNaught Syndicate hired Swayze to do a column called " New York , " now appearing in 50 newspapers-a sentimental and often arch performance which reminds some readers of the folksy prose of the late O. O. Mclntyre . And last week , Swayze signed with Sponsor Raytheon ( TV sets ) for a 15-minute radio news program starkly entitled John Cameron Swayze ( Sun . 3:45 p.m. , NBC ) . <P> No pundit , Swayze leaves big political thinking out of all his shows , likes to concentrate on human interest stories . Says Swayze : " Leaving people feeling good-that 's my role . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
