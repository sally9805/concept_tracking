Despite settlements by Kaiser Steel Corp . and two other small steelmakers , the steel strike is biting deep into the U.S. economy . Steelworkers have lost $1.1 billion in wages ; steel companies , $3.3 billion in sales ; the Government , $710 million in taxes ; the nation , 30.9 million tons of steel production . The Commerce Department estimated that the rate of the gross national product dropped $3.5 billion in the third quarter . An index of the eight key economic barometers fell farther in the first three months of the strike than during the first three months of the 1957 recession . The U.S. faced widespread shutdowns in industries that depend on the basic metal . <P> Stoppage for G.M. By the end of last week , General Motors had laid off 185,000 production workers across the U.S. Following nine Chevrolet assembly plants previously shut down , G.M. halted all production of Pontiacs , Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs , closed down all but one Buick plant . By the end of this week , General Motors production , now at a mere trickle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 workers in ten plants , by week 's end will be forced to lay off many more . Ford cut back to three-and four-day weeks to conserve its dwindling steel supply into December . Suppliers suffered with the auto companies ; Chevrolet has canceled orders affecting most of its 26,000 suppliers . <P> In October , as a result of the steel shortage , the auto industry operated at only 77.8% of its planned 646,200-unit level ; in November it is planning only 290,000 units , the lowest schedule for the month since 1946 . Even an early resumption of steelmaking would not help the industry in November , because of the time needed to fabricate the steel into auto parts and fill supplier pipelines . Faced with an auto shortage , buyers rushed to the showrooms . Dealers sold almost as many new cars in the first 20 days of October ( 338,465 ) as they sold in all of September , and sales for the last ten-day period were running 20% over the previous ten days . Some dealers took advantage of the scramble to hike prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were commanding full list prices . <P> Icy Trouble . Layoffs were spreading in other industries . At General Electric 's appliance park in Louisville , 28% of the 11,000 employees have been furloughed . Caterpillar Tractor has laid off 12,000 . <P> Even after the steel strike ends , industry will face a host of other problems . Companies that have exhausted their inventories will have to wait for new stock before they can resume production , even then will need several days to get their plants humming again . Moving ore to steel plants is almost certain to be a problem . The Great Lakes ore fleet , most of which is idled by the strike , has little more than a month left before the lakes freeze over , may not be able to supply enough iron ore to keep the mills operating until spring . Even if the steel firms decide to use more-costly rail transportation , not enough cars are available to move all the ore they need-and cold weather freezes ore in the cars , makes it more difficult to load and unload . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects will be felt long after the strike itself is just an unpleasant memory .
