Mack ( today immediately , or that President Eisenhower remove I him . Representative John B. Beri net of Michigan said that Congressional hearings- hid " demonstrated beyond doubt " the commissioner 's " unfitness . " However , at his news conference , the President , who appointed Mr. Mack to the commission in 1955 , declined at present , to judge the case . Mr. Mack is a Democrat . Ready for Appearance I Meanwhile , Mr. Mack , the central figure in charges and counter-charges about alleged " loans , " " pay-offs " and " illegal influence " in an important television decision , remained silent . The commissioner was reported preparing for a scheduled appearance tomorrow before the Special Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight . It will be his first opportunity to answer formally the accusations of " personal , official misconduct " laid against him by the investigators . For the third day the subcommittee questioned Thurman A. Whiteside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was asked about the many and various ways he had sought to help the commissioner financially . He has testified that over " many years " he had made available " directly or indirectly " thousands of dollars to Mr. Mack . Mr. Whiteside also testified that he talked as a " friend " to Mr. Mack many times to help a subsidiary of National Airlines obtain a license for Miami 's television Channel 10 . Voted to Grant License Mr. Mack voted with a majority of the commission to grant the license to the subsidiary , Public Service Television Corporation , against the recommendation of a commission examiner . Even though the subcommittee has not yet heard Mr. Mack 's side of the case , Mr. Bennett said it was " clear " that the commissioner 's financial and business association with persons interested in the Channel 10 case " were such that he could not properly sit in judgment on the case . " The Michigan Republican said that if Mr. Mack refused to resign , or if the President found he did not have the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand by Mr. Bennett , L .. e of Mr. Whiteside 's severest questioners , followed a statement yesterday by Representative Oren Harris , subcommittee chairman , that he believed both Mr. Whiteside and Mr. Mack to have violated criminal statutes in Federal law . Today Mr. Harris told , the subcommittee in Mr. Whiteside 's presence that he believed the United States Criminal Code had been violated in the Channel 10 case . The chairman said he wanted to call Mr. Whiteside 's attention to two " very important " sections . One provides fines of I$5,000 and a year 's imprisonment for anyone convicted of influencing the " due and proper administration of the law . " The second provided even stiffer penalties for persenS conspiring " to X'defraud the United States or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose . " Mr. Whiteside , from the witness table , protested the chairman 's reading of these sections of the code . He said he had done nothing to make the criminal sections applicable " to him . Widespread interest in the investigation led to President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conference with reporters this morning , if he felt Mr. Mack " should resign or be fired . " " Well , I have no ? judgment at this time because the evidence , so far as I know , is in the process of being concentrated , " replied the President . The President asked reporters to " remember " that a President , ' make appointments in agencies , including the F. C. C. , for a designated term , and " the only way he the appointee can be removed is for cause , so therefore , I assume that would be by a trial of some kind . " He did not indicate whether he had an " impeachment " proIceeding in mind . Whether the President has the authority to remove from office an appointee to any of the " independent " regulatory ! agencies is a question the subcommittee has been studying . The present investigation of F. C. C. pressures is . part of a broad study of six big administrative agencies . The President abruptly cut off questioning on another matter related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter written by Sherman Adams , the Assistant to the President .

" Very naturally , my staff would want to get any additional information that I need , " ? General Eisenhower said . When the reporter tried to pursue his questioning " along that line , " the ' President said : " I do n't want anything more about that . " Mr. Adams wrote a letter dated in 1954 to Murray Chotiner , a former campaign adviser to Vice President Richard M. Nixon . He said that at Mr. Chotiner 's request he had talked to the then head of C.
