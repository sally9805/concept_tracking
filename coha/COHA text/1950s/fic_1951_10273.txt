" The artist never puts on his canvas just one pure color . He un-derpaints . " " What 's that ? " Larcom asked , much interested . " Suppose you want blue . First you put on maybe some brown . Then some green . Some red . Perhaps a touch of white . On top of it all goes the blue . So that when you look at it , the blue sparkles . Like real nature . But all the time you were meddling around with brown and red , that 's what you were after . That blue . " Larcom considered this for a moment and said , " So you writer blokes collect a bunch of ideas . And all the time it 's something else you 're after . " " What 're you after now ? " " A story . " " The one I told you ? " " Perhaps . " " But why are you interested in the Jew ? " " I 'm not . I 'm interested in you . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm sure of it . " " What do you want to know ? " " Why did you go into the jungle to track down a man you 'd never seen ? " Larcom leaned back in his chair and studied the Guadalcanal night . He thought a long time , wondering which of the many veils that covered him he might with impunity remove . Then , with a gesture of supreme disgust , he waved his hands toward the government men assembled in the bar and said , " Who could talk here ? Among these spies ? " He led me along a silent road and onto the planks of the Honiara wharf , where we sat with our feet dangling over . He said , " I mind when there were a hundred ships in those waters . They 're still there , on the bottom now . " " I served here , " I said . " The Lunga region was like a city . " " We must have been here at the same time . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . One night I came into this pier with some copra . I took my money and went into the bar . All I heard was the govern/ment officials laughing about this rich American . Right then I began to like him . Because when the government boys laugh at a man .. . he 's apt to be all right . " " That 's why you wanted to meet Fietelbaum . " " No . That came later . " " When ? " " Toward the end of the evening one of the government men said Fietelbaum must be crazy . Trying to find the body of his son after these years . That was when I knew I must help him . " " Why ? " The thin planter spoke very slowly , selecting his words with care . " If I had a son ... dead for a country I did not love . . . I should not want him to lie ... nameless ... alone ... forgotten . . . " " What do you mean ? A country Fietelbaum did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . " How could he say he loved your country ? Sometimes Americans are n't very kind to little round men with thick hair who have to elbow their way to the top . Fietelbaum 's own son had to change his name . When other rich boys escaped the draft , his boy had to go . When he went to Washington and pounded on Army desks , they laughed because he was a funnylookingfigure . He had no reason to love America . " " So you went out to help him . " " Yes ! " Larcom cried belligerently . " You happy men who 've known all the good things , you wo n't understand this . But a man can grow to hate the world he must live in . " " What happened when you found Fietelbaum ? " " Simply that from then on the men in the bar "  --  and he made a jabbing stab in the darkness as if all his enemies were that night clusteredin the Honiara bar  --  " they had two of us to laugh at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely determined to find that wrecked plane . " " Why did you feel that doing so would somehow . . . vindicate you ? " Larcom stopped abruptly and sucked in his breath . " Never thought of it that way . Now you mention it , I guess it did play a part . Revenge on all the stupid men who came out here to torment me . " " Torment you ? " I repeated.  |p202He  ignored the question . " Fietelbaum had a scrawled map sent him by another pilot in the boy 's squadron . It showed a river and a mountain with an X where the plane went down . There was also an arrow pointing to the mountain : Late sun looks like gold . ' " Now I gasped . For that was where he had found the germ of his ridiculous yarn . Here he had been , involved in some story of massivegrandeur  --  the outcast fighting in his heart against the smaller men who belonged  --  but he could not see that . No he had to make up some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never know Larcom , for he immediately proved my speculation false . He said , " When I saw the mention of gold I knew where the boy 's body must be . You see , I 've been planning this story of mine for years . Thirty years ago I came back to Guadalcanal in total despair . I would have destroyed myself , but one afternoon I too saw the golden mountain . " " Did you find the wrecked plane there ? " " Yes . " I waited for him to add something , but his report of the Fietelbaum case was ended . " Now that 's out of the way , " he said briskly , " we can get on with the book . " " I 've got to think it over , " I parried . To my surprise this satisfied him and he rowed off to his schooner , where Vata reached down with immense hands to pull him aboard . The bar was now closed , so I could not return there , but I was so involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone . So I made my way through the silent tropical darkness and up the steep hill to the plateau where the government officials live . There the cool breeze refreshed me and I saw that a light still burned on Dennison 's porch . " You must forgive me , " I apologized . " Only too glad ! " Dennison cried , combing out his moustache and puttering about to find London magazines and a bottle of gin . We sat facing the glorious sweep of stars and dark ocean and distant shadowy islands . " All they actually found , those two , " he said with an involuntary shiver , " were some buttoms and a cap brim . Still , that satisfied Fietelbaum . " Casually , as if to imply that I had no real interest in Larcom , I observed , " This Larcom . A queer duck . "  | " Very . Always fighting with the government . I must say I bear him no grudge . You see , I happened to be the only one who did not scorn him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ah , yes ! A most dismal affair . One of those things that can sour a man for life . " " Such as ? " " When Larcom first arrived on Guadalcanal . . . about 1913 I 'd say . . . pitched right in , you know . Very fine worker . But four years later he faced the inevitable island problem . He needed a woman . " " He take a native wife ? " " No fear ! Not he ! A vessel put into Tulagi en route to Sydney , and since Larcom knew some young ladies there of good breeding , he went back to test his luck . " " Did one of the Sydney girls agree to marry him ? " " Never got to Sydney . Boat put into Noumea . It was the hell hole of the Pacific . Convicts , prostitutes , murderers . It was a vile place , Noumea . " " Larcom lose his money ? " " Much worse . He lost his heart . A convict 's woman . Married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larcom 's agony became clear . The stiff British families had refused him admittance to their homes . There had undoubtedly been scenes whose scars became evident whenever he spoke with contempt of " the government men . " " You guessed it , " Dennison said , bustling about for some ice . He interrupted his account by showing me a newly bound volume of the Oxford Book of English Verse . " Quite a decent job , what ? " he asked . " How did Mrs. Larcom react ? " " We were quite convinced that she was a French prostitute , which of course she was , and no one would speak to her . When she entered the stores  --  there was silence . We British can be very cruel , you know . " " How long did that last ? " " Not long . This girl Renee had known a much different life . The beer halls , the wild excitement of Noumea . One day a ship put into Tulagi . An American freighter picking up copra . She ran off withp204one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So that was the end of Mrs. Larcom ! " " Indeed it was not ! If it had been as simple as that Larcom might have recovered . After all , many men lose their wives . No , as the ship was leaving , Renee appeared on deck stark naked . She screamed horrible insults at everyone . She had dug up all the island scandals and aired them in frightful words . The sailors cheered her on , and in that way she left Guadalcanal . " As Dennison related this his hands began to twist and after a moment he said quietly , " She did not even spare me , although I alone had spoken to her . She knew that I was in love with the Governor 's wife . Naked , she hurled this information at the waterfront . I have always suspected that was why I did not progress in the service , as I had planned . " Dennison shook his head gravely as he recalled the ancient debacle and I asked , " Why did Larcom stay here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Habit . " " So he lives with his bitterness ? " " Men do the same in Liverpool . " From the querulousness in Dennison 's voice I knew it was time to leave . By some odd shift the conversation was no longer Dennison and I probing Larcom ; it had become Larcom and Dennison protecting themselves from the stranger . Yet when I stumped down the hill , when I saw below me the shadowy suggestion of Honiara mysteriously new , forever primitive , I felt a great twisting in my heart . Somewhere in the story of Larcom there was a core of meaning , that terribly precious jewel that all writers seek . So I hurried down the dark road , past the barracks , past the new post office with the bright intertwined GR , and onto the frail wharf . Before me unfolded one of the imperative sights of the world : a jungle night with stars aloft , a tropical sea with shimmering iridescence , dim islands rising in the distance , a boat with lights . In that moment I understood all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could speak with Melville and Rupert Brooke and Louis Becke . How distant the schooner seemed , how remote from time . " Haloo ! " I cried . " Haloo there , Larcom. "  |p205There  was no sound in reply , not even an echo . There was no motion , no new light . " Haloo , Larcom ! " On shore , among the dark huts , a light showed . An immense black figure appeared beneath the bending palms . " You ? Master ? You want get ship ? " " I 'm seeking Mr. Larcom . " Breathtakingly , before me loomed Vata . " Master Larcom he no stop long ship . He stop long shore . " He put his hands to his mouth and gave a long , mournful cry . We listened in the darkness and could hear only the lapping of water on the sea-shelled coast of Guadalcanal . Mysteriously Vata announced , " Master he come . " I looked ashore and there appeared the angular form of Larcom . I was drawn to it mightily , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall figure at the other end ran to meet me . " Larcom ! " I cried . " By God , it 's you ! " As if we had needed each other we met midway along the wharf and shook hands eagerly , as if we had not been talking less than three hours ago . " I wanted to see you , " I blurted out . " Everything 's settled , " he announced joyfully . " It was remarkable . When I got back to the ship it all came crystal clear . " " What did ? " I asked eagerly . " The plot for our story . " " Oh , " I said . He ignored the disappointment in my voice and babbled , " I never understood about writing books until you mentioned using many colors to get the right one . My story was too drab . Now it 's fixed . " " How ? " I asked , disgusted that I had been diverted back to the old channel . " I have a wonderful idea to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just this . We go back to Brooklyn . " " What do you mean ? " . " Like before . I said the young Marine was from Brooklyn . You said you could n't talk Brooklyn . All right . When you get back , visit Brooklyn and listen how they talk . It 's very distinctive . "  |p206Something  warned me that I ought to stop Larcom right there , but he was quivering with volcanic emotion . " The boy 's from Brooklyn . But that 's not all . No , sir ! Because you see . . . his mother used to live on Guadalcanal ! " He stepped back to invite my comment . What could I say ? TentativelyI asked , " How does that help the story ? " He gripped my wrist with terrible strength . " Do n't you understand ? " he half screamed . " The lad 's mother lived on this island ! All the time he was growing up she used to tell him stories about it . Then he comes back and recognizes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him save his company because he knows where a certain river is . His mother told him all about it ! " He stopped and asked in a hoarse , hopeful whisper , " Would n't that make any book successful ? " " How did his mother get from Guadalcanal to Brooklyn ? " " I thought you 'd ask that , " he said gleefully . " You see , it 's simple . She was the wife of an explorer . Like the Martin Johnsons . She was out here . " He waited . " Well ? What do you think ? " I had to be honest . " Your made-up story . . . it 's pretty bad . But your real story . . . " " What do you mean ? " he asked sharply . " The story about you , " I said . " About your Noumea wife . How she ran off to Brooklyn . The lonely years that followed . And then your sense of identification with Fietelbaum . If you are willing , Larcom , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped away and said , with furious venom , " You idiot ! You damned stinking fool ! You 've guessed none of it right . I 'll write the book myself . " Quivering with fury he left me , but as he reached the launch he turned in anger and shouted , " So you think I felt a bond of affection for Fietelbaum ! Ask your tattle-tales at the bar what I did to Fietelbaumwhen his plane left . " Then he added derisively , " You bloody dreamer ! " I was furious with myself for having caused an open breach with this man who had wanted me as a friend . I returned to my shack and lay most of the night staring at the single light on his schooner , riding in the mists of Iron Bottom Bay . In the morning I hurried over to the Chinaman 's for coffee , andp207since there were no white men abroad at that hour I tackled the Chinaman as he fried the morning ration of Spam . " You know Larcom ? " " Sure , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Fietelbaum ? " The Oriental face burst into a sunny smile . " Sure , he good fella too much . Each day he rent my jeep . Twenty-five dollars ! Whoopee ! " " Were you at the plane when Mr. Fietelbaum left ? " " Sure ! He give me twenty-five more dollars drive him there . " " Was Larcom there , too ? " " Yes . " " What happened ? " The Chinaman looked back at his skillet and would say nothing . I downed my battery acid , asked him about Hong Kong and then asked again , " What did Larcom do ? " " He bad fella too much ! He come up with paper in hand . Check for thousand dollars . " " Where 'd he get it ? " " Mr. Fietelbaum send it to him . For helping find son in jungle . " " Then what happened ? " " Larcom tear check in small pieces . Push them in Mr. Fietelbaum'sface . " " Did Larcom say anything ? " " He swear . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn money for work like that . Police drag him away . " " What did Mr. Fietelbaum do ? " " Tears come to his eyes . He run up to where police hold Larcom . " " Then what ? " " Mr. Fietelbaum  --  he good too much  --  he stoop and kiss Larcom on hand and say , Forgive me . ' " " Why did he say that ? " I pressed . " Maybe they know something together , " the cook suggested . " They good friends , because when Mr. Fietelbaum grab his hand , Larcom cry , For God 's sake , no ! ' Then he run away from police and we not see him many months . " I left the smelly restaurant and walked along the dusty roads of Honiara until the government offices opened . Then I burst in onp208Dennison and cried , " I 'm sorry as hell I kept you up last night . But sometimes I get fixations . Terrible , gnawing ideas . Ninety-nine of them are a waste of time . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , old fellow ! " the expansive clerk said , sucking his moustache . " Used to do a bit of watercolor myself . Many an essay before you strike the thing . " " I 'm trying to piece together some things Larcom has told me . Under what circumstances did he go to Sydney ? " " The most astonishing , I sh 'd say . " " Such as ? " " His son , Raoul . " " Son ? " I echoed . " Yes . The French whore left him a baby when she absconded . He was the pride of Larcom 's life . Fine chappie . I taught him Latin . He won a bursary in Australia , and I must say I felt rather proud . " A native messenger appeared and said , in perfect English , " Sir , the Governor has asked me to inform you that he is still waiting for those reports . " " Oh , dear ! " Dennison cried . " Oh , dear me ! " He grabbed up a sheaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off like a schoolboy . In a moment he returned and said apologetically , " Very methodical , the Governor . " Quickly he added , " What we need in the tropics , of course . Very methodical . " " Why did Larcom go to Sydney ? " I asked . " Ah , yes ! In 1939 the lad volunteered to join the British Army . Larcom used all his savings to go down to see the boy off . He was a grave sight when he left here . A Chinese tailor in Tulagi made him a proper suit . He looked abominable . But even those of us who despisedthe man had a moment of compassion when we saw him go grimly forth to say farewell to Raoul . " " Why do you say compassion ' ? " " Because Larcom hated England . He hated what the English systemhad done to him . Yet he knew that Raoul had no such feelings . The boy loved distant England , and with a willing heart he went to fight for a land he had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " For once in his life he behaved like a decent man . He did not try to dissuade his son . " I left Dennison 's neat office with a new knowledge of Larcom , the lonely man whose life had been tied up with his son , but I was not prepared for what happened as I stepped out into the road , for there was the tall planter , waiting for me with a greasy notebook under his arm . " You must read this , " he said . " I lied to you that first night . BecauseI have the novel all written . What I really wanted was for you to touch it up and find a publisher . " He insisted that I sit right down on a log  --  the bar was not yet open  --  and read his masterpiece . I opened the cover and read the title page : The Mountain of Gold . I turned the page and there , beautifully handlettered , was the inscription : To Raoul , With Love . The first paragraph read as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realize that ere long he would be plunged into the depth of one of the most big adventures ever recorded in the history of mankind . Harry McGonnigle was a fine , handsome , upstanding young Marine pilot who knew no fear . His country was at war and who was he to stay cowardly at home even though his father objected at the idea of his son fighting a war , especially airplanes ? " Then came a freshly inked insert , added the night before : " I forgot to say that Harry 's mother once lived on Guadalcanal . " Resolutely I handed the manuscript back to Mr. Larcom . I think he saw in my eyes the inescapable conclusion that it was hopeless . " So it 's no good ? " he asked bluntly . " That 's right . " " What 's the matter with it ? " " It 's hard for me to say . Maybe an illustration will explain . You 've heard of Alexander Dumas ? The Three Musketeers . Well , one day a young man came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a novel ! ' Dumas asked , You have a good plot ? ' The young man kissed his fingers and exclaimed , A plot that is all excitement . Charactersthat breathe . Settings that bedazzle the eye . And the suspense is truly unbearable ! ' Dumas clapped him on the shoulder and cried , Good ! Now all you need to make it a novel is 200,000 words . ' " For the first time in our acquaintance Mr. Larcom laughed . " You mean I do n't have the words ? "  | " That 's right . " Now he really guffawed . " You should get a job telling people bad news . You make it palatable . " " The bar 's opening , " I said , and we had a couple of whiskeys . We had a rare hour together , the tension of the book no longer coming between us , and I was inspired to say , " You must not regret the hours you spent writing your book . It has been like a medicine for you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It prepared you for when Fietelbaum arrived , looking for his dead son . You could sympathize with him , having lost your own boy in the war . " With great control Larcom put down his glass . Coldly , in a colorlessvoice , he said , " You are still an idiot . Raoul was not killed in the war . He served throughout with great gallantry . " " Then what happened to him , Larcom ? You must tell me , for Raoul is now eating away your heart as his mother did during those long years of bitterness . " " There is nothing to tell , " he said austerely , preparing to go . " Do you know where he is ? Now ? " " Yes . In Jerusalem . " For a moment I was bewildered . I was so close to the truth about this man that I could not bear to see him leave . " Larcom ! " I called . " Wait a minute ! " " Good-bye , " he said in his ashen voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I cried , but he started off for the wharf . I ran along beside him saying , " Do n't go like this , man . In these days you 've come to know me as a friend . Do n't pull the veils of bitterness and hate about yourself again . " " What is it you want ? " he demanded , but in his voice I could hear that he wanted to talk further with me . I said , " There 's a powerful story . In you . Think of the Americans to whom Guadalcanal is a sacred name ! " " I offered you a story , " he said , hammering his notebook with his fist . " You turned it down . " " But tell me just one thing . " " What ? "  | " Why did you track down Fietelbaum ? What impelled you ? " Again there came the weighty pause . Could he trust me ? Would I understand ? Then the decision : " There is no explanation . " With that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted . " Damn it , Larcom , you must n't run away like this . You 're no outcast . You 're a passionate human being . Do n't let the clerks of this island ... " Contemptuously he said , " You 're still guessing . " And within ten minutes he had cast off the schooner and was coasting down the gloomy shores of Guadalcanal , seeking out the plantation to which he had brought his French whore , from which he had sent his Englishson . I never saw him again . But on the last day , as I waited for my plane in the blinding heat of Henderson Field  --  that empty , sanctified strip of coral  --  the Governorof Guadalcanal came to bid me good-bye . Apsley-Grieve was the perfect symbol of all that Larcom had hated : cold , aloof , opinionated , capable , relentless in enforcing Englishmoral and social systems . He bowed stiffly , said he hoped my stay had been profitable . Then he surprised me by adding apologetically , " You know , sometimes we feel we hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national shrine , not ours . " I tried to counter with some felicity , but he interrupted . " Damned sorry if that bounder Larcom annoyed you . But please discount any unfavorable reports you heard about his treatment of your countrymanFietelbaum . . . I mean , the scene here at the Field . . . Most distressing , you know . What I mean to say is , he cursed Fietelbaum and tried to strike him in the face . Well , point I 'm making , poor devil 's to be excused . What you must bear in mind is something that 's not generally known . While Fietelbaum was in the jungle searching for his son , Larcom got news that his son ... Raoul , you know . . . Splendid chap . . . Apple of the old man 's eye and properly so . Raoul was murdered while on duty in Jerusalem . The Stern Gang , you know . " Apsley-Grieve 's cold voice was like the gray report of history . " What happened then ? " I asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that murderous Vata . Swore he 'd assassinate Fietelbaum . But when they finally met , some kind of miracle took place . Queer fish ,  |p212Larcom  . Beat the bush for two months till he found all that was left of Fietelbaum 's son . Some buttons and a cap brim . You see , the cable had reported that after the bomb explosion in Jerusalem there was no trace of his own son , Raoul . No trace at all . "  |p213DURING  THE WAR men who served on the bad islands had two unquestioned beliefs . When the Americans left , the local people would revert to the old somnolence . And the jungle would quickly devour everything that we had accomplished . Espiritu Santo is a good place to test these two theories . In the early stages of war , Santo was our biggest base . In 1942 we landed ships at the edge of a jungle so dense that it even invaded land which was uncovered at low tide . In two months we had a flourishing city that soon grew to a population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had more public services than many American cities . A telephone system with seven exchanges and 570 distinct distribution boards , a superb interlocking teletype network , a radio station , miles of fine roads , forty-three movies , a PX department store , industrial shops of all descriptions , an optical laboratory , four huge hospitals , a mammoth steam laundry , and on the edge of everythinga full-fledged Masonic temple ! At one end of this vast installation there were a few homes occupied by Frenchmen , and a few grubby tropical stores . Farther out were the hovels in which indentured Tonkinese slept after working the plantations . And beyond them , in the bush , lived some of the world 's most primitive savages . How did peace affect these people ? A visit to postwar Santo is a revelation ! Along the foreshore stretches a newborn tropical town of about fifteen hundred . There 's a hotel , a half dozen tailors , two barbers , a shoemaker , two movies and a dance hall . The town , called Luganville , probably sets a record in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never more than one house deep . It is terribly inconvenient , since the postoffice is three miles from the business center . Automobilesare a necessity and gasoline is 8o  --  a gallon . Says one resident , " In Luganville everywhere is on the outskirts of town . " A social and economic revolution has occurred in Santo . The Tonkinese have been set free and now have all civil privileges . They wo n't work for planters , whom they hate , and they wo n't patronize the established stores because they have opened shops of their own . They run the taxis and own the barbershops . They arep214ingrained in Santo life and the white men foresee another Pacific tragedy . Like the Chinese in Tahiti and the Indians in Fiji , the Tonks seem destined to oust the natives . The black men have also changed considerably . Those about Luganville now wear tailor-made shorts ( $2.25 ) and T-shirts ( 85  --  ) . They work a few days and then knock off for a good time . Although the law forbids it , the Tonkinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the road are common . Some of the natives have bought trucks , which they run as taxis for their friends , filling the trucks to the last inch with singing , shouting , arm-waving blacks . Even in the deepest jungle the American invasion had an effect . Stone-age families now have gasoline drums for water , army blankets , and cartridge cases to be used as trunks . The white man has profited from the material comforts which he has newly gained . He often has two cars , a refrigerator , two or three big quonsets and all sorts of Yankee odds and ends . In addition he usually has a couple of thousand American dollars stashed away , less than the avaricious Tonks , but still a good nest egg . Life in Santo is delightful , free , riotous , happy . Take the Club Civile , for example . The officer 's mess at the P.T. base has been completelyrefurnished and enlarged . The paneled ' walls have been waxed , expensive paint has been used to make the dining room a medley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows . The food is terrific ! At dinner you sit in an upholstered chair at a table with a bright red cloth . Before you , amid the sparkling glassware , is a nest of plates . Navy silver , brightly polished , is lined up . The soup is split pea with croutons baked in oil . The second course is a local fish , cooked in wine and served with a delicate French sauce . The next course is a brief one , asparagus in oil and vinegar . Now you are down to two plates and the main dish arrives : steak with golden French fries and a chicory salad . Red wine is served , and there are five cruets with different condiments . For dessert you get a French cheese or a piece of pastry , followingwhich , if you wish it , a liqueur . Probably no American town of 1,500 could provide such a meal . The game room has a poker table with a green felt cover , darts , bridge tables and a bar . A lounge , which stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass and provides a magnificent view of the channel . After a sojourn in British islands , one aspect of life at the Club Civile is arresting . People of all colors belong . There are Melanesian half-castes , Martiniques of high color , and tomboy Tahitian girls . It is disturbing to remember that in a British colony these people would live beyond the pale , despised by whites , hated by natives . Although I have not settled in my mind what the relationship between Pacific races should be , I feel , when I see the uninhibited happiness of a French gathering , that brotherhood has been attained . But to see Santo at its boisterous best you must go to the movies . In a huge quonset by the sea , a full-fledged cinema operates with an American projectionist , Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films and individual wooden seats . There is a show each Wednesday and Saturday , with some talk of a Sunday matinee . Europeans pay 400 , Tonkinese 320 , and natives  --  who would never be allowed near a British cinema-210 . The house is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole place roars with laughter at comedy or shrieks with delight at scenes of really violent disasters . The main feature starts and then , at some critical point , the lights come up and everybody scrambles outside to the refreshment bar . Here six waiters dish up beer , ice cream , cookies , soft drinks and candy . An old Tonk woman in a peach-basket hat tosses down a lemonade while across from her a native in blue-duck shorts gulps a beer which some white has bought for him . The intermission lasts about forty minutes and then the show continues . On Saturday nights , when the movie ends , the seats are pushed back , jazz records are played , and everybody has a whale of a dance till 3 or 4 in the morning . The proprietor of this amusement palace is one of the great charactersof the Pacific . On Guadalcanal I complained that I had n't seen an alligator . My host consoled me . " Do n't worry . At Santo you 'll see Tom Harris . " Actually , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's knocked about the island for thirty years , been thrown out of same , been a trader for Burns Philp  --  known as Bloody Pirates  --  and bought up plantations . He has a face like Punch , a belly laugh like Falstaff.  |p216He  was a wonderful friend to the American forces who alternated between raiding him for selling grog to enlisted men and awarding him letters of commendation . He knew most of the important figures and has a treasured batch of war correspondence : December 18 , 1943Dear Mr. Harris : Admiral Sherman is playing golf this afternoon on the Santo links , and if it is not too much to ask could we have a couple of your boys as caddies ? We will pick them up at 3:10 . A. F. HOWARDNow launched in a new career as impresario , Harris has built up a solid aesthetic philosophy . " The best plot is a man , a horse , a villain and a lost mine . My people do n't go for this talk-talk society stuff . One of the worst flops I ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bellboy . But give us a good Western ! My word , they tear the place down . A good chase , with some revolver play , is about the best , although hanging from a cliff is good , too . I guess the finest picture I ever saw was Winners of the West , a thirteen-part serial . The Europeans ridiculed it at first , but by the fourth episode everybody on the island was trying to get in . They stood outside and looked through the doors . When a scene ended with the hero about to be killed , the noise was so great it deafened me . Europeans yelled louder than the natives ! " Harris says the only other really good picture is one with airplanes , although he will go for a gangster picture if it has enough gunplay and murder . " But , " he insists , " what we need is Westerns ! " It is interesting to speculate that considering all the people in the world , perhaps the only universal dramatic form ever conceived is the formalized Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the States , the people who really love movies prefer two men on horseback , galloping over the desert , firing at each other . Harris has also evolved a new theory on intermissions . " My plan is to have them as long as the customers will buy anything . This eight-minute stuff is ridiculous ! I give my people twenty-five minutes , maybe thirty . If they seem to be spending well I allow them upp217to three-quarters of an hour . In this way they go back to the feature in a good frame of mind . They 're not hungry . " The American projectionist came to Harris by chance . Ray Jenkins is a quiet , balding fellow from Hollywood . He 's 30 years old and of all the troops who were stationed on Santo  --  perhaps half a million at one time or other  --  he 's the only one who came back . " I like the climate and the people , " he says . During the war he spent two years at Ship Repair , about a quarter of a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santo is like Southern California , except it 's damper . If you take enough quinine you do n't have any trouble . " Since all newcomers neither French nor British must opt which of Santo 's two legal systems he will live under , Ray has chosen to be a Britisher . " They 're more like us , " he says . The business of having two governments  --  called the Condominium and universally burlesqued as the Pandemonium  --  is one of the most fantastic phenomena in the Pacific . Imagine the New Hebrides with a population of less than 45,000 having two complete governments in which every office in the one is duplicated in the other ! There are two systems of money , French and Australian , two types of postage stamps , a French system of law in favor of the planter , a British code which protects the native . The comic-opera confusions are so hilarious they practically justify the exorbitant expense . Says a British planter , " Suppose the British try to make me do something . I run right away to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , Have you surrendered the islands to the British ? They 're making a monkey out of you . ' So the French get mad and protect me . French planters do the same thing with the British . " Another reports , " At a murder trial I was an assessor , a cross between a civilian judge and a juryman . There was a French judge who did n't speak English , and an English judge who did n't speak French . The interpreter would ask the native a pidgin question , then translate it into French for the French assessors and into English for the rest . The French judge wished to question the native 's reply , so he asked a question , which was interpreted to the English judge and then put into pidgin for the accused . And the interpreter never really understood the native , who did n't know what all the fuss was about . We hung him anyway . He was undoubtedly guilty . "  |p218Yet  ridiculous as this farce is , it was once justified . France and Britain faced each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbance might cause a complete rupture . Therefore a compromisewas reached over the New Hebrides , and this may have saved the peace of Europe . Certainly it helped preserve the alliance of these two powers against Germany in 1914 . Today the Condominium is indefensible . " In fact , " says Tom Harris , " there 's only one good thing about the system . Neither governmentcan ever levy an income tax ! " Like most islanders , he thinks the New Hebrides should be turned over to the French . Two problems may force booming Luganville back to the decay which Americans predicted . The first , strangely enough , concerns jeeps . The cliche symbol of the South Pacific used to be a palm tree by a lagoon . Now it 's an over-age jeep bounding along bumpy roads . What will happen when they wear out ? On every island Chinese make new cover tops , but no spare mechanized parts can be bought from the United States because of dollar trouble . Many predict that after a splurge of fun , the islanders will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second headache is money . Where is it going to come from ? Copra plantations are rotting because there is no labor , and a substituteeconomy has not been discovered . For the present everyone is taking in his neighbor 's wash , spending the American dollars scrounged during the War . When this ends , what ? In the meantime the people of Santo are having a whale of a time . It 's good to see the New Hebrides happy , for in the past they were perhaps the most infamous blot on white civilization and certainly equal to the African slave coast , since the crimes of the Hebrides were committed after a public conscience had stopped the African trade . Originally these islands contained a million natives , some say more . Each valley supported its villages where cannibals ate only grown men killed in battle . Now the population is about 40,000 . One island dropped from 12,000 people to 256 in a few decades . By and large , the great numbers of dead were killed by white men . Three brutally vicious practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planned introduction into difficult islands of new diseases . A freebooter would catch a native , wait till he caught either measles or whooping cough , and then plop him onp219some island . Sometimes in less than a month 50% of the population would die , mainly because they lay in sea water to subdue their dreadful fevers , a practice which worked with malaria but not with the new plagues . And when the ships got back to Australia , the captains would narrate in public their cleverness in getting even with natives who were not willing to become slaves . Second was the slave trade , called blackbirding . Ships prowled the islands kidnapping natives into virtual slavery on the sugar fields of Northern Australia , where the practice was protected and encouragedby colonial laws . A neat trick was to bolt a huge water tank to the bottom of the hold . Large bunches of natives were asked to shift it and were ridiculed when they could n't do so . More boys were called to show the white man . Then the hatches were lowered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia . This happened as late as 1901 . On one such ship the shanghaied blacks created a disturbance , so the crew opened the hatches and spent the night firing rifles into the mass of slaves . One man held a light so the others could aim . They killed sixty and severely wounded sixteen , all of whom were tossed overboard on the grounds that " they would have died anyway . " And a civilized court in 1872 dismissed charges because a black man could not testify against a white ! The third cause of depopulation was the sandalwood trade . Southernislands in the group had the great misfortune to contain this aromatic tree which commanded such a high price in China . A completelycraven group of outlaws stormed ashore to get it . They murdered , burned and forced the natives into jungle slavery . The sandalwood islands never recovered . Naturally the natives retaliated . Today there is an island known as Erromango of the Martyrs . Here six missionaries , one after the other , were clubbed to death , yet other missionaries ultimately stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pacific missionaries have been a bane , but all their excesses are outweighedby the fact that in the New Hebrides they alone tried to redress the crimes sanctioned by the public . Native memories are long , and there is still resentment against the white man . Today it is reflected in the Jon Frum movement . This remarkable society was founded as the result of religious confusion . A new religion entered the islands and made great promisep220in order to lure natives from the old . They went , but soon found that each church was defrauding them so they reasoned , " All the time we go to John the Baptist . Now we go from him . " Hence the name . The movement is militant , obstructionist and confused , another of the native ferments that are spreading across the Pacific , some directed by Communism , others , like Jon Frum , not . If Americans guessed wrong about the effect of war on the people of the New Hebrides , they were equally wrong about the jungle . It has not reabsorbed the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that led to the remote swamp where men were trained in jungle fighting . Many quonsets are standing in their old positions and look pretty much as they did five years ago . The air fields , exceptBomber 2 which has been torn up , are still used , and NAB ( Naval Advanced Base ) is a thriving Tonkinese village , incredibly dirty . Where buildings have been torn down the jungle has rushed in and covered the sites , but for the most part the tropical obliterationAmericans predicted has not eventuated . The word jungle , say the purists , should never be used . It has an emotional coloring and no precise meaning . The scientific term is " the tropical rain forest . " This term accurately describes most of the so-called jungles of the South Pacific , for they are not the frightful places that many would have us believe . Most often the rain forests are composed of very tall trees which form canopies over land that is rather fun to travel . The rain forest is much more like a warm Canadian woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests that are like beautiful parks with no undergrowth , others that seem to be cathedrals with sunlight slanting through the rose windows . Brilliant birds fly through the solemn spaces , and I am always struck by the silent majesty of such sanctuariesand agree that to call them jungle is misleading . But there is another kind of rain forest ' that is neither inspiring nor majestic , and the vast forests of Espiritu Santo are in that category . Here each tree is burdened with parasites . The sky is never seen , the ground never free of crawling growth . Malignant vines clutch at the intruder . Extensive swamps suck down his feet , and the atmosphere is rank . Let me explain just what the Santo forest is like . At the end of a road there is a cascade which was much enjoyed by American troops . From this road a trail leads to a spot some four hundredp221yards above the waterfall . Once I used that trail and came to where I could hear the cascade tumbling down . I was inclined to cut across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but an Army officer with me felt we had not the time for such a trip , so we retraced our steps to the highway . The next day three men followed that same trail , came to the same spot , heard the noisy waters . They took the short cut , and when they had gone fifty feet from the trail realized that the going would be tough . Great vines impeded their way ; dense growth of all kinds hemmed them in ; so they decided to return to the trail , but in that short distance they had become lost . For two days they tried to gain the cascade . They could hear it sometimes , but from which direction the sound came they could not tell . If they climbed a tree to survey the ground , they could never get above the tangled canopy . The nights were fearful . Insects of all kind attacked them . Mosquitoesflocked about their faces . There was an armadillo-like millipedesix inches long that exuded an alkali which ate away the skin wherever it touched . Thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tore at them with inverted fish hooks . There were prickly vines , itch plants , poisonous leaves . If they stepped upon a fallen log , it crumbled into dust . If in stumbling they scratched themselves on the rotten wood , the sore festered in six hours and might not heal for six months . They could not drink the water . They could not see the stars . And if they infected one of their thousand bites they ran the risk of blood poisoning . At the end of the two days one of these boys was dead . Another was out of his mind , and the third had stumbled into a coastal village . Through all their experience they were within three miles of 100,000 men . Perhaps the purists are right . Perhaps such malignant forests , so poisonous to men , are technically no different from the more clement forests where one may stroll with pleasure . But it seems to me there is a word in our language for the forests of Santo , and I shall use it : JUNGLE . Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Santo jungles . Three times we found the men . Toward the end of my second visit to Santo , I was beginning to think that I knew at least the outlines of tropical life . I had lived on dozens of rough islands , gone into the jungle as I wished , and sharedp222many experiences with people who live in the hot lands . But I was about to encounter an aspect of equatorial life that taught me how little I really understood . It started one evening at six . I was walking along the beach when a great pain shot through my eyeballs as if someone had beaten me on the head with a club . I staggered for a moment and the pain subsided . For more than an hour nothing happened , and then at dinner I felt the connecting tissue in my joints collapse . My limbs seemed to be hung onto my body with flapping wire . I had never before experiencedanything like this and sat very still , waiting until I could regaincontrol of my muscles . All that night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became raw and I heard ringing sounds in my head . In the morning I was taken to the hospital , where I turned in a fancy temperature that pleased the nurse and scared me . I had malaria . On my mission up the Watavihan River I had acquired the often-fatal Guadalcanal fever . The pretty white mission hospital in Santo is run on the principle that the human bottom is a pincushion . As one famous beachcomber said of it , " They shot me from every angle . " Still , it was interesting to be sick in pidgin : The shirt is to be taken off ? " Lipt him up calico . " The tongue looks better now ? " Ah , he good fellow too much . " I rediscovered the adage that the only perfectclimate for a human being is bed , and I settled back to some of the most patient care I had ever known . But as I lay in bed I thought : I shall get over this quickly with modern medicine , but not five miles from here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melanesian savage is inoculated at birth and never discovers what a malaria-free life might be . The shaking comes , the pain behind the eyes , the great fever . The naked man huddles in his hut and does not complain , for all men have fever . At forty the savage is an old , old man . At forty-five he is usually dead . His most prized possession was the tattered blanket he once found in a dump . It had been his only medicine . There is a more dreadful aspect of malaria . If the dead corpuscles coagulate in the brain , death is instantaneous . But even then the worst has not been said . Usually the dead corpuscles do not attack thep223brain . They crowd into the kidneys . Then the patient , who thinks he has merely another case of fever , urinates and reels back in horror . The urine is smoky black ! He has blackwater fever . In racking pain he dies , his kidneys dissolved , his head a receptacle of molten lead . There are now medicines which cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease , once described as " the only way the islands had of striking back at the white men who had debauched them , " is still fatal if treatment is not prompt . And in the jungle , where there is no medicine , the native always dies . Americans did much for Santo , and all the inhabitants admit it , but we left one harrowing scar that will never be forgotten : Million Dollar Point . At the east end of the island there was a huge coral pit , later converted into a dump . When the war ended all new rolling stock was moved into this dump . There were tractors , uncrated new jeeps , earth-moving machinery , ambulances  --  anything you could think of on wheels . The Frenchmen eyed this collection enviously . Overtures were made to buy it , but always at the last minute the deal fell through . The French say the Americans were afraid to follow orders . The Americans knew the French were stalling , sure they would get the lot for nothing . A deadline was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms were about 8  --  on the dollar . So a ramp was built into the sea and bewildered mechanics climbed aboard the great earth-moving monsters , the road graders , the heavy trucks . Ignitions went on . The engines coughed , and the giant processioncrawled along the ramp . At the last moment the mechanics jumped free and the lumbering dinosaurs of modern industry plunged into the sea . There was a hiss as engine blocks cracked , and a rising column of water standing for a moment like a monument in a weird graveyard . The wealth was gone . A British subject says , " It continued for days . Those warehouses of canned food , the cloth , the tools , and most of all the jeeps ! There were men who watched with tears in their eyes . Million Dollar Point , we call it . Not even the Americans could explain what they were doing . One day they oiled the engines carefully . The next they threw them into the sea . How could governments permit such a thing to happen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made the most profound impression on me . There are lovelier islands , true , but the main reasonp224why I like Santo is its zany life . On the day I left I was entertained at lunch by the commissioner for native affairs , the resident liaison officer of the British Government , the collector of taxes , the chief of immigration , the administrator of housing , the commandant of the army garrison , the secretary of the council , and the protector of French interests . It was a small luncheon , because all of the above officials were one man , a delightful French philosopher I had once known in Tahiti . As the plane came he sighed mournfully and said , " You must be very sorry to leave so happy an island . Where everybodydances and gets drunk and the chief of police never makes a fuss . " He was also the chief of police , and he was right . I was sorry to leave.  |p225A  social and economic revolution has occurred in Santo . The Tonkinesehave been set free of their indentures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sent from Efate to investigate a ratherastonishing report which had reached the British half of the Condominium Government . I proceeded aboard a small schooner which fortunately was putting in at the very plantation I intended visiting . At dawn two mornings later I caught my first glimpse of La Fecondite , the famous establishment of Jean Perouse , who was the cause of my embarrassing inspection . La Fecondite was well named , for great copra plantings ran right to the water 's edge , except where a belvedere had been built over the fringes of a placid bay . There a fine pavilion stood with iron chairs and a long table , where diners could enjoy their dinner in the evening while they watched the lights along a superb reach of channel . Behind the belvedere stood an imposing house , built in the colonial style with many verandahs , and behind it clustered a half dozen small red-and-white cook houses , card rooms , dining quarters and American refrigerator units . Deeper in the jungle , beyond a small stream , were ranged forty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were the famous cacao groves that had made Jean Perouse a wealthy man . He had given us trouble before . During the war , American MilitaryPolice were constantly raiding La Fecondite , and Perouse was charged with almost every kind of offense . We discovered , however , that he maintained good relations with American commanding officers , so that as fast as the M.P . ' s arrested him , the responsible officers set him free , and it was in this way that he assembled the finest collectionof American heavy equipment in the Hebrides . But it was not regarding material things that I was seeking M. Perouse . I left the schooner , climbed the steps to the belvedere andp226proceeded to the main house . There I was met by a ruddy faced man of fifty-five , well preserved , handsome , hearty in what one might call the British fashion . He spoke to me first in French , but , since I am only adequate in that language , promptly switched to English . I was brief . " M. Perouse , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are harboring on your plantation a young woman who is  --  shall we say ?  --  wanted in Australia . " He appreciated my candor and greeted me with a disarming grin . " Come in , Mr. Crompton , " he said . " Would you be averse to a whiskey so early in the morning ? " He was most generous and led me to a large room exquisitely furnished in bamboo , where he placed a full bottle at my elbow . Then he apologized and asked me to excusehim for a moment , since , as he explained , he always tried to listen to the morning news from Los Angeles . The radio was dull that day . You know , the usual dreadful stuff from America . Gangsters killing people and strikers rioting . When it was finished he said , " Rather boring , Crompton , but I did get to like the damned Americans when they were here . Now what can I do for you ? " " About the Australian girl , " I reminded him . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she be sent back to Australia . " M. Perouse laughed heartily and said , " Old man , you 're too late . Your pretty has flown the coop ! She returned two weeks ago . " This rather took me aback , but I said , " How in the world did she ever get up here in the first place ? " " Simple , " he laughed contentedly as he recalled the incident . " I live here alone . That is not good . So I wrote to a trusted friend in Sydney and said , Surely there must be some pretty girl down there who would enjoy a long vacation on a real tropical island . ' To my surprise , and I may add satisfaction , Phyllis arrived on the next plane . " I have to admit that I gulped and asked , " What ? " " Yes , " he said frankly . " There are many lonely men in the world . Even more lonely women . I could afford to pay the plane fare , so what was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . She spoke English ? " " But naturally ! Fine girl , too . Not well educated , perhaps , but a fine girl . Sang soprano . "  |p227I  hardly knew what to say . I 've lived in the New Hebrides long enough to realize that no Englishman will ever completely understand the French mind . Of course , that wretched affair at Oran when we had to sink the French fleet did n't help , either , but the more I study the French the more convinced I become that their way of life is certainly not appropriate for decent Englishmen . I said , " So the girl Phyllis Crump has returned to Sydney ? " " Yes , Mr. Crompton , she has . " I asked for a few additional particularsabout this most irregular affair and then , since the schooner had not yet left the channel , I proposed to rejoin it and thus save several days of unpleasant travel . But as I was about to go there was a commotion outside the house and M. Perouse asked to be excused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned with a scrawny Tonkinese foreman . " This is Nguyen Bo , " he said , introducing the Oriental to me as if he were a gentleman . " I 've heard of Nguyen , " I said , for this was the Tonkinese who was causing the French Government so much trouble about the repatriation claims . " Better stop with us , " Perouse suggested . " You may be interested in this . " " If you 'll excuse me , " I said , not wishing to be involved in any way with the Tonkinese problem . The French had brought these Orientals into the New Hebrides years ago under an ironclad agreementto repatriate them to Tonkin when their indentures were discharged . Now , faced with postwar troubles in Tonkin and having no ships , the French were autocratically extending the contracts . It was an ugly situation in which I , as British civil servant , must express no opinion . But M. Perouse insisted . " Forget the schooner . I 'll drive you down to the wharf . Sit down , Nguyen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Tonkinese , that he presented his case admirably . He said , as I recall , that his people were willing to go on working for the French under certain conditions . More rice , a pig a week for each ten families , whitewash for the huts and pay in cash . The critical point , however , was their freedom to work for whom they wanted , even if it entailed travel from one island to another . M. Perouse told Nguyen that he considered the terms reasonable ,  |p228but  that the French were inflexible on two of the points . No pay in French money . No freedom to leave present contracts . Nguyen said , " But you accept the terms , do you not ? " " Of course ! " Perouse said . " Have n't we always got along together at La Fecondite ? " " With you , yes , " the Tonkinese promptly replied . " But the Gov-ernment ? " " The Government ? " M. Perouse shrugged his shoulders . " The Government is always wrong . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In times of change all governments are always wrong . " Nguyen then asked , " What are we going to do ? " Perouse replied , " Those that work for me have no complaint . The rest must be patient . " Nguyen said , " Not much longer . Soon there will be trouble . " " Nguyen ! " Perouse shouted . " Do n't be a fool . Because if trouble conies I shall side with the white men . Remember that . " " With you no trouble , " the Tonkinese leader insisted . " With the Government , yes . " There was a moment of tension and then M. Perouse laughed . " Well , I warned you . " Nguyen laughed , too . " And I warned the French Government . " I report this conversation in detail so that you will more clearly understand what happened later . Specifically , however , on that day there was no ill will between the men , and in the presence of Nguyen Bo , M. Perouse said to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This was decidedly improper for him to have said and I told him so . " M. Perouse , " I protested . " And you , too , Nguyen . You must consider that I was not present at this discussion . Officially I know nothing about it . " This time I rose in earnest , but as Nguyen Bo left , a native rushed up in a jeep crying , " Mastuh ! Plane he come ! " " I 'll be damned ! " the hearty Frenchman cried . " Come along , Crompton . Important business ! " He pushed the black driver out of the jeep and after I had managed to climb aboard  --  what a horrid vehicle !  --  he drove like mad along his coral road . I noticed , when the dust permitted me to look , that his establishment was the only one in these parts actually cleared and in full production . He had wire fence to keep his cattle in , sev/eral American army trucks , six quonsets and an ice plant . I asked him how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " I can always get coons or Tonks to work for me . I give them good pay and extra rice . " It seemed that we would miss the plane 's arrival , for as we neared the edge of his plantation we were blocked by a road grader . " Where did you get that monstrous thing ? " I asked . " Handsome , is n't it ? " he asked with much pride . " I got that for teaching a fat American colonel how to shoot flying fox . " I affected not to have heard this , but M. Perouse slapped me on the shoulder . " Come , my friend , " he said . " Your country and mine , they did great things together in the old days . Now , for a while , we are finished . It is the time of the Yankees . Look ! Anyone who can build a machine like that deserves to rule the world  --  for a few years . " I simply refused to acknowledge such blasphemy and by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain  --  I shall not speak for France  --  is undergoing present difficulties , occasioned I must say mostly by a Labor Government , but I should never wish it said of me that even in the darkest days did I for one moment believe or even fancy that what we have known as British leadership could decline one jot or tittle . M. Perouse accepted my rebuke , not graciously , perhaps , for he stopped pointedly by the grader and patted it fondly , saying , in French , " My little sweetheart of the fat colonel ! " Then he plunged his foot down on the accelerator and we fairly bounced along . " I must n't be late , " he chanted . " Not today of all days . " We arrived at the seaplane base just as the PBY came in for a very wet landing . When the tug went out to unload the passengers there was a moment of great commotion , following which a girl of about twenty stuck her head through the hatchway , screaming , " Hiya , Monsoor ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who looked as if she had n't bathed in three days , peered at the dock and shouted , " Coo ! That 's him in the helmet ! Yoo hoo , Monsoor Peroose ! " I am ashamed to add that the distasteful picture was completed by M. Perouse , who jumped up and down shouting , " Flora ! Gracie ! Over here ! " The next half hour was a nightmare . The two girls made a great noise as they came ashore , each with a cheap guitar . They were , I will concede , rather pretty in a vulgar sort of way . During the firstp230five minutes they informed M. Perouse , whom they had never met before , that Phyllis Crump had skipped out on a Dutch steamer before the police could catch her . " Phyllis was a darling , " the redheadedgirl , Gracie Dalrymple , said . Then the other regrettable person , Flora Keats , laughed and said , " Phyllis thought this was the best island in the world , Monsoor . " " It is ! " Perouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all fairnessI must explain that these girls were Australian and not English . In the next four or five months we heard many reports about M. Perouse and his two visitors . Each week-end there was a gay party at La Fecondite . The girls became famous as guitar players and , I am ashamed to add , as consumers of practically all the alcohol the French could provide . Yet strange as it seems there were no reports of obnoxious drunkenness , but you must remember that French officials are notoriously lax in checking upon such details . That was the way things continued for about half a year . In Efate we British took no official notice of the girls , because M. Perouse lived under French law , and it was no concern of ours what he did to wreck the morals of his community . Many persons have made fun at the expense of the Condominium Government , but I am proud to say that this spirit of laissez-faire of which I have been speaking has permitted two great nations to live side by side in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think is no small accomplishment , even though I do sometimes feel the amity has been preserved principally through the willingness of us British to overlook some fairly irritatingbehavior on the part of the French . For example , about this time two Tonkinese workmen on an island near La Fecondite were murdered , and since only Frenchmen were involved , there was some dissatisfaction when I was dispatched from Efate to inquire into the particulars . It was not a pretty story ; indeed it was not . A brutal French planter had decided that the Tonkinese were being pampered , so on his own recognizance he had cut the rice ration . The Tonks had protested and in the confusion of argumenttwo men were killed . No one could say who had done the shooting , so no one was charged with the murders . French gendarmes moved onto the small island and evacuated all Tonkinese to the mainland , where M. Perousc hired them at the wages they requested . He issued a double ration of rice and spentp231long hours with Nguyen Bo , explaining what rights the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I participated officially in all negotiations , and much as I had to deplore the way M. Perouse lived , I was nevertheless impressed by the scope of his thinking and by his fair play . At times he seemed more like an Englishman than a Frenchman . While the negotiations were in progress he insisted that I stop with him and I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that never during my entire service in the New Hebrides did I enjoy myself so much . La Fecondite was a most charming place . It had curtains at the windows , polished floors and wonderful food . Normally I do not drink wine with my meals , but M. Perouse offered such excellent vintages that I could not refuse . At first I found it awkward to sit at the same table with Gracie and Flora , but under M. Perouse 's kindly tutelage they had lost much of the garishness I noticed that first day at the plane . I recall two aspects of my stay with special pleasure . The singing was magnificent . The two girls each played the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied their hearty voices the result was rather pleasing . Planters came from many miles to attend the musical evenings , and I shall pass over without comment the fact that occasionally one of them spent the night , nor do I think it proper for me to discuss what seemed to be the arrangements betweenM . Perouse and his two guests . The second reassuring aspect of my stay was the substantial work accomplished by my host in bringing to the attention of all French planters the critical nature of the Tonkinese problem . Once he had Nguyen Bo meet with four Frenchmen who up to that time had been adamant in their refusal to consider any contract revision . Occasionally , much against my will , I was brought into these meetings and I recall vividly a speech by M. Perouse , in the course of which he reasoned , " We are all seeking the good life . Each of us calls it by some different name . My father conceived it as Liberte , Egalite , Fraternite . Our English friend here calls it fair play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . But we had better find out . " An official who had served in Indo-China said haughtily , " The only reasoning they understand is a rifle jammed down their throats . " This infuriated M. Perouse , who called for Nguyen Bo , but thep232official said he would leave La Fecondite that night if he were forced to discuss anything with a damned Oriental bastard . M. Perouse looked at him sadly and said , " Our English cousins once said that about Indians . Now it 's the Indians who wo n't talk with the British . " The French official jumped to his feet . " Am I to understand , M. Perouse , that you are willing to release the contracts ? " " No ! " Perouse cried sharply . " By God , I 'm not willing to release these men . I made a fortune out of the yellow devils and if they were stupid enough to honor the old contract I 'd make another . " Then he dropped his voice and said , " I am not willing to release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for a few francs . " There was a moment of silence and the f onctionnaire asked , " Who spoke of murder ? " " Anyone who thinks he can keep backward races backward much longer . " I could have cheered M. Perouse for that statement , but of course it would have been most improper for me to have done so . As a matter of fact , I would subsequently have been disgusted with myselfhad I publicly approved the man in view of what was to happen next day . M. Perouse called for me right after breakfast and said , " Mr. Crompton , I have a most difficult problem and I must enlist your aid . " " Certainly , " I said , for I was beginning to like the cut of this man 's jib . " It 's about money , " he said . At this I gasped , for he was reputed to be wealthy , whereas I made only a few pounds . . . Well , since it 's a matter of public record I make four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with prices what they are is truly inadequate . " I 'm sorry , " I said with what I hope was honest frankness . " I did n't mean a loan , " he laughed . " I mean I want to buy some pounds to be delivered in Sydney . " " That 's not difficult , " I assured him . " How many ? " He replied , " I want each of the girls to have a thousand pounds , clear . " " The girls ? " I gasped . " Yes . They 're going home . On today 's plane . " He became veryp233melancholy and rang for the servant to bring the girls in . I immediatelybegged to be excused , but he would n't hear of it . Gracie and Flora appeared in their best dresses , and M. Perouse said , " Girls , I 've arranged with Mr. Crompton for each of you to get a thousand pounds when you land in Sydney . " Flora kissed M. Perouse and Gracie kissed me , adding , " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike being called by my first name , but we had all enjoyed such a splendid time at La Fecondite that I did not protest . I was , however , totally disgusted and even outraged by what happened next . M. Perouse made a little speech in which he said , " I am desolate about your departure , but as I explained I am at heart a Frenchman and much as I love the English language I am not at case in it . As I grow older I want to have French things about me . French wines . French songs . The good French language of my youth . " Then all three of them began to weep , M. Perouse too . I was humiliated , but still I had n't heard the worst , for he added tearfully , " I have a Marseillaise girl coming up on the next Trapas plane . " The girls cried some more and said they hoped he would be very happy . When they boarded the seaplane , the girls screamed back to the crowded deck , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightfully by shouting , " Thanks for the thousand quid , Herbert ! " I considered trying to explain to those on the dock that I was not giving her the money , but everyone was weeping , so I said nothing . At this point I was willing never to see M. Perouse again , for I could scarcely countenance the things he did , and this matter of throwing out the Australian girls to make way for a Marseillaise was so absurd as to be revolting , and not solely because the losers happened to be of British stock but rather because it seemed an offense against the decencies . In fact , my association with M. Perouse had corrupted me to the point where I was beginning to think that a man need merely wave his hand and beautiful girls would come running , but I reflected that my host 's three million francs probably had a lot to do with it . Much as I wished to leave La Fecondite , my Government directed me to report further on the likelihood of fresh labor troubles , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thisp234chap Nguyen Bo . Again I took pains to remind him that the British Government was not officially involved , in that the French were solely responsible for Oriental affairs , but I did let him know that I was interested in the problem so far as basic justice was concerned . Nguyen Bo , when interviewed alone , was an astonishing person , astonishing . He weighed not over eight stone , had black teeth from betel juice , sharp little eyes and a nervousness one does not customarilyassociate with Orientals . It was his living quarters , however , which affected me most . As you know , when the Tonkinese were first brought into our islands the planters devised a cheap , rapidly constructed type of housing for them . A lozenge-like foundation thirty feet long and eleven feet wide was built of coconut logs and coral . Across the middle a solid wall was erected , creating two living spaces fifteen feet by eleven , each with a curved lip . Into every one of these halves a complete Tonkinese family was moved , and since to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hordes of yellow people lived in unventilated squalor . Although I am more aware than most of the many stupid mistakes we English have made around the world  --  for example , many of my superiors have , I am ashamed to say , been very ordinary men  --  I do not honestly believe that in any colony of ours we would have permitted this particular offense against human beings . Nguyen Bo 's half-lozenge was a revelation . It was whitewashed , very clean , most orderly and withal somewhat attractive . He said , " My wife , two daughters and three sons live here . " I could say nothing . He went on to tell me that his people were still pressing for the same points , which he did not bore me with by repeating . He said there was no disposition to cause trouble , but that some of his friends had spirited out a long report to the United Nations at Lake Success . I tried to hide my surprise and asked if the French knew of this and he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how an unlettered Tonkinese , smothered in a jungle , could have heard of the United Nations , let alone submit a report . I questioned him directly on this and discovered that it had been smuggled out by Gracie Dalrymple . She was the redheaded girl from Sydney . " She could n't have written it , " I argued , for lovely as Gracie 's singing voice was , I doubt if she could write her own name.  |p235Thereu|pon  Nguyen assured me that it had been written in French , from which I deduced that Jean Perouse himself must have been the author . Nguyen Bo would not confirm my guess and begged me not to mention it to anyone else , lest it reflect discredit on the Frenchman as a kind of traitor to his class , and this is the first time I have divulged my belief , although subsequent events have more than substantiated my rather shrewd deduction . As I was leaving the lozenge there was a great commotion about the big house of La Fecondite and I saw to my amazement that a piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the last Morinda and must have cost a fortune . As I watched its progress through the door , M. Perouse rushed out with a cablegram and cried , " Danielle said there was only one thing needed for her complete happiness . A piano ! " " Who is Danielle ? " I inquired . " La Marseillaise ! " he cried ecstatically . Then he showed me the cable . Danielle said that since she had never before been in the South Pacific , and since the trip out was a very long one  --  this was a most remarkable and expensive cable , sent collect  --  and since she feared loneliness she was bringing along another girl who sang with her in the cafe . But they had to have a piano ! On the next Trapas the two girls arrived . They were tall , sparkling-eyedand very French . Danielle was the prettier of the two , but Alceste had the finer sense of humor , a trait which I prize greatly . Even before they landed they completely captivated everyoneon the dock , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been . Danielle played the piano competently and Alceste joined with her in delightful French songs , although I must in all fairness say that their voices were somewhat pinched in comparison with the fine , strong voices of the Australian girls . All the unattached young Frenchmen of the island , and some of the attached ones as well , made La Fecondite their headquarters , and even though the French girls did not accept me with quite the openhearted friendship the Australians had extended , I nevertheless grew to consider myself a member of the household . I may add that I now kept my luggage at La Fecondite , where M. Perouse had kindly allocated me a permanentroom . The big event naturally was Bastille Day , a typically French holi/day , but one in which all men of good will can properly join , since a triumph of human freedom in one corner of the world is a triumph everywhere . I therefore decided to stay for the festivities and on July 12 guests began to assemble from many plantations , but I saw with alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the planters said , " Sooner or later there 's going to be trouble , " and he intimated that he and his friends would know what to do . An entire room was set aside for alcohol , to which I am addicted in moderation , not to the point certainly of being an embarrassment either to myself or others . The day of the thirteenth was spent mostly in drinking , since it would have been ungracious to have launched formal festivities before all the guests had arrived . That evening , at the close of a long and pleasant day in which I must say I upheld my half of the Condominium , I was recovering in the belvedere , where the cool breezes helped clear my head , but I looked up the channel and saw a most distressing sight . From a nearby island two large canoes had set out for the upper reaches of La Fecondite . At first I assumed they were filled with natives bringing in more fish or chicken for the feast next day , but as I studied the craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Tonkinese ! I watched for some moments and saw two rather clumsy barges , each jammed to the Plimsoll line with Orientals . Seeking not to alarm anyone , I left the belvedere quietly and found M. Perouse , in a rather intoxicated condition , beating time while Danielle sang French cabaret songs . With some difficulty I got him to his feet and asked the girl to leave us alone for a moment . " M. Perouse , " I whispered . " If I can judge correctly , more than two hundred Tonkinese have converged on La Fecondite . " He looked at me , first with rather bleary eyes and then with increasinglysteady ones . " Mr. Crompton , " he said slowly . " Are you sober enough to drive me a few miles ? " " Certainly , " I said , for although I may not have covered myself with distinction as a government official in the New Hebrides , I must honestly admit that I have yet to find the Frenchman who has ever , as the Americans say , " put me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Around us the jungle seemed to resent our coming . Long runners of vine slipped across the road and our headlightscast weird reflections on huge leaves . As we drove , M. Perousep237became quite sober and said , " Crompton , I hope I have n't let you in for something messy . Are you armed ? " " No , " I said . " Good , " he replied . " I prefer them to see that I have no weapons . " We now started to overtake straggling Tonkinese workmen , each carrying some kind of implement , but none , as far as I could see , with guns . When they first saw the jeep they stared in open animosity , but when they discovered that it was M. Pcrouse they watched our progress with passive masks . We came at last to a large coconut grove where several bonfires had been lit . The smoke , curling upward , was grotesque . M. Pcrouse left the jeep , a stocky , handsome figure of a man . He went right up to a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments he called me over to verify some points . I said that La Fecondite was filled with planters who had assembledto celebrate Bastille Day . I assured them that the French had not collected an arsenal for an attack upon the Tonkinese . " We saw guns ! " they replied . " A few , " I said . " Like you , the Frenchmen are frightened . " " Can we believe that ? " " Look for yourselves . We are not armed . " One of the Tonks cried , " But what about the jeep ? " A dozen men ran over and ransacked the car , finding only a bottle of vermouth which M. Perouse had forgotten . " You can have it , " he said , and for a moment there was a bit of merriment to relievethe tension . But as the Tonkinese passed the bottle , there was a sound of rifles in the distance and in a moment Nguyen Bo rushed up in a truck . " They are attacking our huts ! " he shouted . Immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Perouse and me . " Nguyen ! " Perouse shouted , but the noise was so great that the Tonkinese leader did not hear . So each of us shouted and finally he came to where we were held prisoners . " Nguyen , " M. Perouse pleaded . " If trouble has started only you and I can stop it . Please work with me . " The little man reflected for a moment and said no . The French had begun this .. .  | " How can you be so sure ? " " Only the French have rifles . " " But look over there , Nguyen . Four of your men have guns . " " M. Perouse ! " the wiry man interrupted . " It is the Tonkinese who are dead . I know , because one of them was my wife . " There was a deathly silence as this news passed among the enragedworkmen , but Perouse would not be deflected from his purpose . " All the more reason , my friend , why you and I should preventmore shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wizened little foreman . " Nguyen , " he said quietly , " we must go . " We climbed into the jeep while four Tonkinese with rifles hung onto the frame . Nguyen said they would kill us if there was any trickery . To this M. Perouse did not even reply . We reached the northern end of the Tonkinese hovels to find the entire population in a state of hysteria . Some drunken planters had detected the passage of many workmen through the jungle . The Orientals were challenged and some fool discharged his rifle . A Tonkinesewas killed , perhaps a planter , too . Then a group of planters had rushed out of the big house and had begun to shoot wildly . Two more Tonkinese were killed in the native huts , one of them Nguyen Bo 's wife . Now there was desultory firing in the distance . Nguyen and Perouse studied each other . Finally the Frenchman said , " My friend , this had to happen . You and I know that . Now we must stop it . " He left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying could help prevent bloodshed , while he and Nguyen , followed by the four riflemen , started down the trail on foot . At the top of his voice Perouse kept shouting , " My friends ! Hold your fire ! " I last saw him going forward , his hands in the air , pleading for a truce . It was not until next day that I learned what happened . As the six men approached the plantation a Frenchman cried , " Perouse , you stinking traitor ! " Some enraged fool shot into the crowd and killed Nguyen Bo , whereupon the Tonkinese riflemen aimed at Perouse , who fell into the dust of the very plantation he had spent years in perfecting . I shall gloss over my own experiences . When news of the tragedy reached my guards I was beaten a bit but I suffered no real harm . After two days I was released , and when I staggered back to La Fecondite my heart stopped for a moment.  |p239The  Tonkinese had fired one corner of the big house . The Frenchmen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of life and the ambulance driver said , " It was a very bad night . All Tonkinese are under arrest . We have issued guns to the white men . " At the hospital , the doctor said there was nothing wrong with me except bruise and shock . He said he would , however , keep me with him for some days as a precaution . I was led to a small room , where to my amazed delight I found Jean Perouse propped up in bed . He was badly wounded , a portion of his face having been blown away . But with one unbandaged eye and one corner of his mouth he grinned . Through jaws wired together he said , " We accomplished little , old man . " We lay there for many days because it seemed that one of the kicks at my kidneys had caused a minor infection . M. Perouse said that he had never understood why people could not live together peacefully . He told me that only one good thing had come out of that terrible night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He explained that a report had reached the United Nations and in self-defense the French Government had revoked the law . He added that the piano had been wrecked and that he was consideredto be a traitor by his countrymen , none of whom came to see him . I said I could not understand such a judgment against a man who was obviously acting in the common good . He laughed and said , " Times change and opinions follow . In a year it 'll be forgotten , because this time I was right . " Tears came to his cheek and I thought that his ostracism had cut deeper than he admitted , but he said , " The worst blow is that Danielle and Alceste have not even bothered to visit me . Who can blame them ? They must believe what their friends say . Danielle is marrying a planter in Efate . Alceste is singing in Noumea . " He folded his hands and seemed so dispirited that I forebore remindinghim that the Australian girls Flora and Gracie would never have deserted him that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British custom to do so . I did not see M. Perouse again for nearly a year . Then it became my duty to deliver some papers to him regarding the arrest ofp240Phyllis Crump in Singapore . It seems she had with her four French railway bonds which had been traced to La Fecondite , from where she must have stolen them . I had been instructed to deliver the documents in person , since the complaint had to be signed before a witness , and as soon as I entered the gates to La Fecondite I felt my spirits rise . There was the same clean wire , the scraped roads , the well-tended cacao with its leaves glistening in the sunlight . At the Tonkinese quarters new whitewash had been applied and all the middle walls had been ' knocked out so that each family could have double space . I must admit that I found petty pleasure in the fact that whereas all other plantations seemed to lack labor , my friend  --  for I have grown proud to call M. Perouse my friend even though his inheritedpatterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed . La Fecondite flourished . Damage had been repaired and the very sight of this productive land made my spirits soar , but as I stood there surveying the scenes I had grown to love , I heard a strange sound from within the house , as if a once-fine piano were being played out of tune . I listened for some moments but could not discern what it was that I was hearing . Finally I knocked on the door , and the haunting sounds stopped . M. Perouse appeared , and for a moment I suffered an involuntary shock , for the left side of his face was a nasty scar . He sensed my discomfort and ran his hand across the scar , saying , " It does n't hurt , Crompton . I was fortunate . " He took me into his spacious living room , which was more polishedand attractive than ever . I came immediately to the point , as is my custom on official visits , and showed him the reports from the Singapore police . He studied them casually and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . " Four railway bonds , " he laughed . " All these many papers about four railway bonds ! Which I gave to the young lady . " I was unable to dissuade him from this story and said that I would have to have a sworn deposition from him to that effect . " But naturally ! " he said with great affability . " - Write what is necessary and I 'll swear to it . " I could not myself take such a light view of legal procedures which in their day have saved many innocent lives and helpedp241preserve the civilized decencies , but I composed some lies which sounded plausible and he signed them . Then we needed a witness to attest the signature and he said , " Some of the French planters will be coming out tonight , but let 's get the business finished now . " Ile rang a bell and a native girl appeared . " You run catchim Quoyn , " he said . I was dreadfully embarrassed when the Tonkincsc arrived , an intelligent-lookingyoung man who was introduced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to inform M. Perouse that in a Singapore court the signature of some unknownOriental named Quoyn would be worse than useless . It would prejudice the deposition . I never saw M. Perouse so infuriated . He jumped up and stormed at me , " Do we never learn ? Why do we die ? Why do we bother to try to make the world a better place ? So that some judge in Singaporecan say Mr. John Doe is an honorable name because it is commonin Liverpool , but Quoyn is not , because the damned stupid judge ca n't pronounce it ? " I have not repeated his exact phrasing , which was shocking even to me . The upshot was that he grabbed the depositions and would have destroyed them had I not said , " M. Perouse ! If you do not send the clearance , Miss Crump may get a long jail sentence . " I can see him yet . He stood there , a man terribly disfigured , his entire body trembling with rage . Slowly he dropped the papers and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tonkinese to Quoyn , who smiled and left . He was silent for a long time and said , " Thank you , my friend . The very least I can do for Phyllis is to get a decent French signature . She was a very good girl , Phyllis . She sang like a thrush . " Night came on and we sat there . In the dusk he said , " I think we shall never learn . Crompton . We have a new fonctionnaire now , straight from Paris , a man with an unbelievable record for courage against the Nazis . Yet he says unofficially that what we should have done was shoot our yellow bastards right and left when we had the chance . " He poured a stiff brandy , which I must say I appreciated . Then he became more relaxed and said , " Yet look at us a year after the big affair ! A few have lost money . None of us can order the Tonks about as we used to . But by God everyone has a better life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crompton , you never liked music much , but are you up to some now ? " I protested that on the contrary I enjoyed music very much , providingit was n't that blatant American jazz , and that I would relish some right then . I rose to tune the radio but he said , " No ! Never use that if the real thing is at hand . " He called for the servant and said , " You can tell the girls to come in now , " and from the interior of the house appeared two beautiful little Tonkinese girls whom I judged to be about twenty and eighteen . They were dressed in European style , but with Tonkinesehairdo . He introduced them and said we were ready for some music . In a manner which betrayed their familiarity with the house , for in fact they lived there , the girls went to a cupboard and produced two odd instruments that I had never seen before . With tiny hammersthey began to play the strange , elfin music I had heard earlier that afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose beautifully placid faces did not change expression as they tinkled forth a new tune . " You 've got to acquire a liking for it , " my host said . " The girls ? " I whispered . " Who are they ? " " The daughters of Nguyen 13o , " he replied . " They were orphans , you see . It was the least I could do for an old friend . " He listened to more of the music and then said he would like them to sing . They laughed nervously and said they did not like to perform beforestrangers . " Crompton 's no stranger ! " he cried emphatically , slapping the younger girl on the bottom . As their thin reedy voices blended in an old French song he sighed and whispered , " If you seek the good life , Crompton , you must be prepared to accept many new things . "  |p243N  EW ZEALAND is probably the most beautiful country on earth . The official school history says that when Richard John Seddon , the great Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place even than God 's Own Country . " The New Zealander finds it difficult to believe that there could be a better land than his , either on earth or in heaven . He is always ready to boast of four national distinctions . " We have a land of unmatchedbeauty . ( True ) We have demonstrated that two races of different color can inhabit one land in peace and honor . ( True ) We showed the world how to pass social legislation for the good of all . ( True ) And today we enjoy the highest standard of living known by any nation . ( False ) " As regards the first claim , the natural beauty of New Zealand is difficult to believe . Its two islands , no larger than Colorado , combine all types of alluring scenery , all kinds of climates . Consider what you could see in one day 's travel . At the northern tip of North Island you find a dazzling tropical beach sixty miles long . ( New Zealanders call it Ninety Mile Beach . ) It ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marlin and swordfish . Farther south are prehistoric sub-tropical forests with towering kauri pines that took 1500 years to mature . In the center of North Island is a brooding desert surmounted by three majestic volcanoes , one or the other of which seems always to be active , spouting lava ash by day and beacon fires at night . At Rotorua the wonders of Yellowstone Park are challenged , for here geysers play , mud pools bubble and hot waters tumble down over colored terraces . On the west coast you will see Mount Egmont , rising in beauty , the perfect snow-capped cone of a dead volcano , cloud wreathed and pointed like Fujiyama . But in New Zealand you always say , " Fujiyama looks a lot like Mount Egmont . " Now you leave the North Island and fly south across Cook Strait , where vast mountains sank into the sea until only their tips remained aloft . Here earth and ocean mingle in astonishing beauty , varied , twisted , glowing in the sunlight.  |p244Ahead  lies South Island , where the real beauty of New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , perpetually glaciated , with huge fingers of ice reaching almost into the sea . Nearby are the Southern Alps , immense rows of jagged peaks beneathwhich nestle dozens of wonderful lakes , each serving as a mirror for some great range of mountains . On the coast , near the glaciers , you find dramatic evidence of New Zealand 's turbulent geological history . During millions of years this land rose and fell repeatedly . When it lay under the sea , sand covered it . When it was thrust upward , limestone deposits collected . Finally the resulting rocks were forced high into the air , where howling winds eroded the sandstone layers and left tall rounded pillars of limestone wafers piled one upon the other , appropriately called The Pancakes . And then , since New Zealand scenery is completelyprodigal in its wonders , the hungry Tasman Sea ate huge caverns beneath The Pancakes into which tides roar , bursting upwardthrough crevices and shooting thin strands of spray high into the air . Farther south lies Milford Sound , first and finest of the fjords . Cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks . High waterfalls plunge from mountain plateaus directly into its waters , and jagged bays probe into dark forests . At the head of one such indentation Sutherland Falls leaps nearly 2,000 feet down into a solemn glen , one of the superb waterfalls of the world . Almostinaccessible , it is reached by means of a difficult trail labeled on maps " The World 's Finest Walk . " Along ten casual miles I counted forty sheer granite cliffs , each at least Boo feet high , three of them dropping precipitously for more than a thousand feet . I also saw at least 200 waterfalls , some of them hundreds of feet high . One unnamed one  --  there are so many wonders in this part of New Zealand that they are not even recorded  --  fell 300 feet and then leaped backward , borne aloft on surging currents of air . Another zigzagged eight times to get down a cliff face . A third fell some hundred feet , then dashed upon a huge projecting boulder which split the fall and threw each half high into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grecian horses plunging into battle . At no point in the ten miles did I fail to see at least three waterfalls . Frequentlymore than ten were visible . And this was in the dry season ! In the same ten miles there were other spectacular phenomena sop245far unnamed : a cataract that had gnawed its way sixty feet through solid rock , leaving at the land 's surface a gorge only 36 inches across ; a tiny lake of perfect ultramarine ; a balanced boulder bigger than a cathedral ; a walled valley hidden in circles of granite cliff . And often above me flamed that most brilliant tree , the pohutukawa , at the end of whose branches grow massive clusters of scarlet flowers , so that sometimes the forest seemed to be on fire . On even the best maps the land south of Milford Sound is marked UNEXPLORED . New Zealand has dozens of fjords still to be opened to travel . It has hundreds of natural wonders still to be discovered . One who knows the region said , " For the rest of this century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would astonish the eye . " Proof of this came dramatically in 1949 . New Zealand is geologicallya recent land and has few animals that resemble those found elsewhere . It does , however , have some that arc unique . Among those still living is the kiwi , a long-billed , flightless bird that has become the national symbol . ( New Zealand fighting men are Kiwis . ) Now almost extinct , the kiwi is famous for two qualities : it feeds by stomping its feet over worm holes to imitate rain , thus luring the hors d'oeuvre into position ; and it lays an egg of ridiculous size . If a hen were to do comparatively as well , chicken eggs would be 14 inches long and would weigh three pounds each ! The most famous of New Zealand 's extinct creatures was the moa , a gigantic bird that towered above the heads of men who liked its rich meat so much they exterminated it about 15o years ago . ( There 's a great fight on about this , some scholars maintaining that moas were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds was the notornis , a beautiful turkey-like creature with blue-green feathers and a brilliant red toucan-like bill . The last one was seen in 1898 , a previousspecimen having been eaten by shipwrecked sailors some years before . Then in 1949 some explorers in the wild southern valleys came upon a family of notornis that had miraculously survived . Cautious investigators probed the area and discovered perhaps fifty of the handsome fowl . A surge of excitement swept across the scientific world and other expeditions were hastily outfitted . Warned the Government : " It is ridiculous to call these excursions moa hunts . No moa could possibly be alive in New Zealand . " But the scientistsp246point out that there used to be a dwarf moa and in most bars you can get even money that sooner or later a moa is going to turn up in those southern valleys marked UNEXPLORED . The first human beings to see this compact wonderland of New Zealand were a mysterious unidentified people who left carvings on the walls of caves . Scientists are divided as to whether these rude artists were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose history is terrible to contemplate . Profoundly peaceful , they outlawed war and settled arguments by play-duels , the mock battle ending whenever a contestant cried , " Behold ! I bleed ! " For centuries they lived in quiet peace . Then the warlike Maoris fell upon them , killed the men , carried off the women . In 1930 there was only one Moriori left alive . He was a grotesque fellow , Tommy Solomon , weighing 588 pounds . He liked to ride horses and always carried with him a small ladder by which to mount . In 1933 Tommy Solomon died , completely wiping out a distinct human race of which it was said , " They were gentle , therefore they per-ished . " The Maoris , who took their place , were certainly not gentle and they are not even close to perishing . They won New Zealand by some of the bravest exploits in maritime history . About the year 900 an intrepid Polynesian named Kupe drifted down to New Zealand from Tahiti and on his return established in Polynesian memory a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1350 a great fleet of canoes migrated from Polynesia and brought permanent settlers to New Zealand . Regarding this hegira more specific information is recorded than is known about Columbus ' voyage some 150 years later . Today each Maori tribe traces its ancestry back to one of the original canoes and takes its name therefrom . For example , the Tainui tribe can relate proudly that the canoe Tainui was 70 feet long , captained by Hoturoa , that it sailed on the fourth night of December in 1350 , and that " Taikehu was in charge of the great paddle Huahuaterangi . " The name of each paddler is remembered , plus the fact that the canoe 's priest turned out to be a thieving rascal who ran off with Hoturoa 's daughter . Even the chant that kept hope alive is recited : " Seek ye the way ! Though the distance be great , though the way be long , keep thy course , 0 son ! Across the waters is thy path . "  |p247The  Maoris were wonderfully capable settlers , and are today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker , perhaps because of intermarriage with native tribes . They are more healthy , for their climate is better . And they are more gifted in self-government , because they stood boldly toe-to-toe with English invaders and slugged it out to a standstill . The Maoris were never totally defeated , so a sagacious treaty was devised whereby two vastly different civilizationscould live together in mutual respect . The spirit of this Treaty of Waitongi still animates relations between Maori and Pakeha , as the white man is known . At the time of signing a native chief exclaimed , " The shadow of our land goes to Queen Victoria , but the substance remains with us . " Surely one day the Maoris will merge into the white stream that engulfs them , but for the present they cling boldly to their Maorihood , slowly acquiring the skills and tricks necessary for survival in a white man 's world . In the meantime they have a good life . They elect their own members of Parliament , who vote the straight Labor line because it was Labor that passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Maoris call this the Stallion Fee . ) Maoris can marry whites , live where they wish , enter whatever professions they prefer . As proof of their citizenship they fought with renowned braveryin both world wars , marching to battle singing their " Maori Battalion Song . " But you do n't live long in New Zealand without discovering that the Maori-Pakeha relationship is not all pleasant . A good deal of hypocrisy obscures realities . Many Maori villages are in fact slums . Sensitive Maoris confide that they never really feel at ease among whites , who shout public acceptance but practice private ostracism . As one complete realist said , " White men do n't marry our girls much any more , because Maori brides no longer inherit huge landed estates . " Even so , the relationship between brown and white in New Zealand is far superior to that between black and white in America . And the Maoris have a good time ! At elections they often vote six or seven times if they particularly favor a candidate . They are great practical jokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of an enemy , thus signifying , " The flesh of your ancestors is caught in my teeth . " As a learned judge of Maori land disputes reported , " If Maori A claims land that once belonged to B 's family , there isp248one bit of evidence that supersedes all others . Can A prove that some ancestor of his killed and ate B 's ancestor ? If so , the land clearly belongs to A. " Maoris have only vague concepts of private property . " The first Maori up in the morning is the best dressed . " It is not uncommon for a man who has bought a fine hat to give it ungrudgingly to the first friend who admires it . Says the white man : " The New Zealand Maori is the finest man on earth . But do n't lend him anything ! " There is one aspect of Maori culture that is a sheer delight , one of those perfect art forms that haunts the memory with true loveliness . Young Maori girls , dressed in knotted cord blouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging poi balls , made of compressed rushes tied to strings . ( Short poi , six-inch strings ; long poi , eighteen inches . ) In delicate rhythms , sometimes brushing their skirts so as , to yield an extra beat , teams of girls execute prolonged and intricate drills . On festive days they do the canoe poi . Then , with each girl whirlingtwo short poi , they seat themselves upon the ground so as to represent their tribal canoe . In back of them a chief rushes up and down flourishing a greenstone club and urging them on . Somewhere in the shadows an old woman stands , chanting through blue-tattooed lips some wild Polynesian account of the great migration . Nov , in their canoe , the girls make the poi balls fly . At first it seems nothing , merely another dance . Then slowly the poi take on the rhythms of the sea . Shoulders begin to weave as if hands carried great paddles . The chief rants and cries . Always the mournful woman chants in her husky voice . Now the poi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping against the body . The entire audience is sailing in that ancestral canoe and the night is tense with the sound of the poi balls . Suddenlythe woman moans . In silence the girls fall backwards , as their ancestors had once collapsed from near starvation . There is now no sound but that of the mysterious poi balls , echoing the tiny slap of waves against the historic canoe . Then the chief shouts . The old woman screams the last measures of the chant . The girls revive , and the trembling poi balls leap to a beat of joy . And there is no one in the room who can not see that early vision of The Long White Cloud ! The white men who share New Zealand with the Maoris are allp249of British stock  --  English as far south as Christchurch , Scots the rest of the way  --  and no matter for how many generations a family has lived in New Zealand , everyone still speaks of going I- form , and they proudly insist , " We are more English than the English . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from England has led them to cling tenaciously to every fragment of their English ancestry . This has both good and bad results . New Zealand has a more homogeneous population than any other major country , and in the last war only four illiterate New Zealanders were found . On the other hand , gifted young people tend to run away front their own land , back to the security of England . Katherine Mansfield , the gifted storyteller , David Low , the cartoonist , and Lord Rutherford , the atomic trail blazer , are only three of thousands who fled their homeland . Every outstanding prime minister has been born outside New Zealand , and it is interesting to read the boast carved into the beautifulmemorial church at Cave : " 1928 . It is noteworthy that all the men engaged in the building of this Church were British-born . " This yearning for the womb of England combined with life in a vivid new land has resulted in a nation which is most conservative in social life yet completely radical in social legislation . This discrepancy can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1840 , so that New Zealand is the youngest of nations . These settlers came from conservative , Victorian Englandand they tolerated no nonsense about " brave new worlds . " It was their proudly expressed determination to transfer " old societies to new places , " and a conscious plan was devised whereby settlers could be kept within sacrosanct social levels , ranging downward from " wealthy gentry of good family " to the laboring lower classes . As late as 1857 one of the gentry begged New Zealand to avoid the errors of the United States democracy and to follow instead a systemwhereby men of property and intelligence ruled as they deemed wise . To this end the price of land was rigged abnormally high so as to prevent laborers from catching a foothold on the social ladder . During one depression an arch-conservative government saw nothinglamentable in the flight of more than 100,000 New Zealanders to Australia , where they could find land and food ! Reaction was inevitable , and under Richard John Seddon , a forcefulimmigrant workingman who rose to be Prime Minister , Newp250Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beingin the forefront of social legislation . Federal votes for women , universal suffrage , forced arbitration of labor disputes , old-age pensionsand a nationwide system of child care were all first provided in New Zealand . From a nation established for the benefit of wealthy men , the country expanded into what it still is : a workingman 's paradise . There were , however , temporary retreats from Seddon 's program , and in the early 1930 'S a bewildered and incompetent conservativegovernment could think up no way to fight the depression . Listen to what a workingman has to say about that period . Tom Neill is now over 6o and has retired to a small farm in the South Island . He is a tall fellow , handsome and mystically convinced about the rights of labor . In his small cottage , immaculately clean , he lives on a government pension and helps his vigorous wife take care of his chickens . His home contains a kind of altar : the glowing fireplace above which hangs the portrait of an unpretentious man in a black suit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i z . In a cheese factory . Five in the morning till six at night . Seven days a week . Often we had to work till ten or eleven at night , but our wages were the same . Three dollars a week and no overtime . Later on I became manager . Then I worked daily from six till nine at night . I had an accident and lay in hospital a long time . I lost every cent I owned and could never get started again . " Mrs. Neill serves a tea of hot scones , six kinds of cake , and thick cream . She says , " I worked at home till I was 31 . Then , thank God , Tom found me and took me away . My parents could n't give me any pay because they earned none . I was never away from the farm till I was i8 . The only entertainment I can ever remember was church lantern slides , mostly upside down . I went to town once a year , but until I was past 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend on myself . " Tom continues . " When the depression came I got a job shoveling a ditch . There were two men working in our gang , strapping blokes they were . I noticed they always ate their lunch to one side . I , beingolder , said , Look here ! Eat with us ! ' And they were ashamed to come over , for all they had was boiled potato skins . The meat of the potato they left at home for the kiddies . " Tom unclenches hisp251hands and says , " I tell you , the rich man 's government had only one thought . Get us unemployed out of the cities so we would n't create riots . The prime minister said , Labor has taken the cuts without protest . Give them another . ' " Tom has cruel memories of the depression but soon the anger leaves him . He looks up at the portrait over the fireplace and says , " That simple workingman up there threw the government out and set up a Labor cabinet that saved this nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Savage . I was near defeated when he came to power . I can still hear what he said in those first days : The Government will pay Christmas benefits to all needy families . ' " The social services provided by Savage 's determined ministry are remarkable . There is an old-age benefit with liberal allowances plus a superannuation income for anyone who can not otherwise qualify . There is a widow 's benefit , an orphan 's benefit and a family allowanceof $1.50 a week for each child up to 16 years of age , extendable if needed . There are benefits for coal miners and for chronic invalids . There is unemployment insurance and a hilarious Emergency Benefitwhich was explained in this way : " Suppose your wife is in love with another man . You wo n't agree to a divorce , so they burn down your store . Obviously you 've suffered a catastrophe . The store I mean . But you 're not covered by any of the preceding benefits . That 's where the Emergency Fund comes in . " Recent governments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , even though never wounded , are aging prematurely . " Every New Zealander receives free a complete medical service , including doctors , surgeons , drugs , certain patent medicines , hospitalization , maternity care , X-rays , massage , nursing  --  and artificial eyes and limbs at one-fifth cost . But to understand the spirit of social legislation in New Zealand you must read the directions regarding soldiers ' pensions : " Boards are instructed that when contradictionsappear in records , the claimant shall receive benefit of any doubt . " The cost of this security is very high , not in money , for the deductionsare modest . A man with a wife and one child pays on a $3000 salary $275 social security and $36o income tax . ( In the United States he would pay $45 for social security and $185 inp252income tax . It is rather the cost in restrictive legislation that seems paralyzing . Consider the case of Mr. C. G. Moore , a happy and popular haberdasher in Greymouth . Mr. Moore must have his shop open at 9:00 A.M. and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay open till 6 . Hours are set by the Government . The wages he can pay his help are stated in law and he must not deviate from them . Recently he got into trouble because the Government found he was paying a foreman less than prescribed . He pointed out that he allowed the foreman a commissionon volume . Then he really was in trouble , for that put the wage above the legal limit ! Mr. Moore 's son works for him and must by law belong to a union ; he may not work voluntarily at night . Hours for tea and lunch are legal matters , as are vacations . A government inspector may visit the shop at any time and call for more heat , less heat , more clean towels , more space for drinking tea . And a rigid fortyhourweek is mandatory . The prices Mr. Moore may charge are set by the Government , which also insists that the books be kept according to their system ( double entry ) and be available for inspection at any moment . To buy stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must apply for an import license , and the Government lists what may be bought and where . A woman in Greymouth recently read about a hayfever remedy made of rose petals . Unthinkingly she sent a letter to Australia , ordering some . When the medicine arrived the Government impounded it and raised the merry devil about sending money out of New Zealand without permission . If Mr. Moore had some money in London he would have to leave it there , since the Government must maintain a favorable balance in Britain . Same applies to any money he might have in Australia . Severalyoung girls in Greymouth married Americans during the war . Their mothers may not visit them unless " the New Zealand girl has a child and the grandmother is over 65 , " when the Government may permit foreign travel . If the Moores want to build a home , the Government will issue a permit if the house does not exceed 1300 square feet of floor space . If they wanted to sell the house they have , the Labor Government would say what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twenty-four chickens , she must register them with the Gov/ernment , which will buy the eggs at its price . It is little wonder that New Zealand voters finally tossed Labor out by a resounding majority . Yet it would be a grave mistake to interpret this as a retreat from liberalism . Before the election the new prime minister pledged that he would alter none of the basic laws . If he were to ( 10 so , it is probablethat his party would be thrown out of office within a month . New Zealand is still a liberal country . What the new party did was to lift some of the onerous restrictions . Like Michael Joseph Savage before them they gave the people a Christmas present : unlimited whipping cream for private use . Mrs. Moore promptly mixed up some Pavlova pies , which she had n't been able to make for years under the Labor Government . Into a sugared shell she poured thick cream , covering it with a double meringue , maraschino cherries and brandied peaches . I am happy to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful taste in my mouth I said , " C. G. , you 've made a lot of money . You have a son to watch the store . Why do n't you travel ? " He thought a moment and considered the good , easygoing life he had . " Where would a man want to go ? " he asked . The typical New Zealander is rather shorter than the average American , and slimmer , too . He wears gray flannel trousers , an expensivesleeveless sweater , and a trim sports coat . ' When he dresses up it 's in a stiff , high-breasted dark suit with vest , which he never discards , even on sweltering days . He is quiet , modest , eager to defendhis honor and addicted to dreadful jokes : " Q. What jumps from branch to branch and wears a bowler hat ? A. The manager of ten chain stores . " Along with the Spaniard , he is probably the most conservative white man still living . He is rarely at ease in public with his wife , whose new-found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he invariably refers to girls by initials , leading to the impassionedmessage I saw scrawled in schoolboy writing within a carved heart : " T. Davies is nice . " He abhors American boasting but indulgesin what might be called reverse-braggadocio : " Although the author would not dare to presume even the scantiest knowledge of the subject , yet he must confess to a not altogether inconsiderable experience in the field . " He badly overuses such words as frightful , beastly , wretched , horrid , miserable and awful . If he has a trivialp254headache he will say proudly , " Really , I 've got the most frightful head , " whereas if he actually has a splitter he 'll say , " Rather a nasty twitch . " But do n't fool yourself . When he says that , he wants sympathy ! He is most unsentimental , which probably explains why there has been no first-rate art of any kind produced in New Zealand to date . Yet he can become maudlin if you mention the gallant All Blacks , two famous Rugby teams ( all-black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massacred the opposition . He speaks softly , using precise English even on road signs : TWO DECEPTIVE BENDS . He is troubled by the intrusion of Australian and American speech forms , yet he himself has many odd expressions and would be astonished to learn that anyone else thought them amusing . Food is never delicious ; it 's beautiful . A good fried fish with lemon butter is apt to be especially beautiful . Assume is often pronounced with an h ; controversy is accented on the tro , capitalismon the pit ; food is tucker ; a man 's wage is his screw . Thirteen , fourteen , etc. , are pronounced with d 's , as thurdeen . Uncertainty is expressed by a drawled " Ah du n no , " and you never speak with a man ; you have a yarn to him . Anything good is wizard ; you do n't make sandwiches , you cut them ; you never go to the hospital , you go to hospital ; and the refrigerator is invariably the frij . Nor does the New Zealander often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , " and " Ah yes , " the latter sometimes being pronounced yay-yissss . There are four sure ways to infuriate a New Zealander . The first is to call his land New Zillan . The second is to confuse the islands . If he 's from North Island you must say , " Those South Island blokes are pretty stuffy . " If he 's from the South you say , " Auckland men are all right , but they seem a bit unsound . Too American . " The North Island is progressive , Labor , industrial and butter . South Island is Conservative National , agricultural and sheep . North Island is the smaller , the less beautiful , the more developed and the more heavily populated , with two-thirds of the 1,700,000 total population . ( Detroit 's population is 1,838,000 . ) South Islanders pride themselves on being better educated , more loyal to England and more substantial in all ways . For many years South Island 's conservative substantialitywas recognized by giving it a bonus of several seats in Parliamentbeyond those its population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auckland area alone has as many scats as all South Island . The third way in which to invite trouble is to confuse New Zealand with Australia . They lie 1400 miles apart and it takes three days by ship to get from one to the other . They have no political connections except loyalty to a common king and membership in the Commonwealth . Actually , New Zealand is much more like Canada than like Australia , whose goods may not enter without permission . Each country uses pounds-shilling-pence , but the New Zealand coinage is worth 25% more than the Australian . New Zealand has no separate state governments ; Australia has a federationof six states plus an immense federal territory , plus an over-all national parliament . Furthermore , Australia has thirty times as much territory as New Zealand and five times as many people . But New Zealanders claim that they are better educated , read more books and have a greater per capita wealth . Australia has much the better radio stations ; New Zealand much the better newspapers . New Zealanders call Australians Aussies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed by Captain Cook , " thus forming , " says the Australian , " the parent stock from which the present inhabitants have sprung . " The two nations have a common defense policy and an agreement , The Anzac Pact , defining their common policies in the Pacific ; but even so relations became badly strained when Englandand America hailed the popular song " Now Is the Hour " as Australian . It 's a Maori folk song , and any New Zealander will put up his dukes if you claim otherwise ! But the one unforgivable offense to a New Zealander is to speak disparagingly of the Crown or of the tie to England . King George VI is the personal King of New Zealand . ( He also happens to be King of England . ) The devotion of New Zealanders to the Royal Family is unique . Country newspapers carry in their society columns casual items like this : " Today Queen Elizabeth poured out the tea for a bricklayer 's wife , a stoker 's wife and a dairy worker at a gathering at Sandringham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princess Margaret served the wives of a verger , a motor mechanicand a farm worker . " Yet New Zealand has suffered two inconsolable tragedies regardingthe Royal Family . Edward , Prince of Wales , loved the land andp256was the most popular visitor ever to tour the islands . His betrayal of the Crown has left a lasting hurt , and although people rarely speak of him , it is obvious that he has wrenched their loyalties . In 1942 the clerk of a crowded hotel could call querulously to the manager , " Would it be proper , do you think , to let American soldiers occupy Prince Edward 's suite ? " He had stopped there one night two decades ago . No king of New Zealand has ever visited his Dominion while ruling , although several have while still serving as Prince of Wales . In 1949 King George planned to do so , but illness prevented the tour . It is difficult to comprehend what this postponement meant . In Christchurch all buildings on the Square were to have been cleaned . With the King not coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main street was to have been repaved for the Royal limousine . Now it is still bumpy . Plumbing was to have gone into hotels that had none , carpets into bare hallways , and paint onto race-track stands . All New Zealand was going to get a face lifting , but none of it was completed , for the King was not coming to see . In early 1950 plans were announced for a substitute tour in ' 52 . New Zealand went wild with joy , and the old plumbing diagrams were dusted off . New Zealand pays no taxes to England , is completely free of laws passed by the British Parliament , has its own coinage and is free to exclude British goods if it secs fit . New Zealand enjoys a national existence completely free of English domination , except that curiouslyshe prefers to use the Privy Council in London as the supreme court of appeal . Yet the love that binds New Zealand to England is immeasurable . When Britain went to war in 1914 , a Conservative New Zealand prime minister declared war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister did the same . To have acted otherwise would have been unthinkable . When peace came , New Zealand gave hungry Britain an outright gift of $28,000,000 , then allocated almost all butter , the best beef and the finest mutton to the motherland . The number of food parcels still mailed each week is enormous . I met an old woman who takes a tin can , packs the bottom with lard , fills it half full of fresh eggs , pours in more lard , tops it off with a slab of bacon and sews it into a stocking for posting to London . Then she herself eats oatmeal.  |p257Few  Americans appreciate the tremendous sacrifices made by New Zealand in the last two wars . Among the Allies she had the highest percentage of men in arms  --  much higher than the United States  --  the greatest percentage overseas , and the largest percentage killed . She rushed the cream of her manhood into Africa and Crete and Narvik and Singapore . Then she watched helplessly as the Japs crept down the islands until only the miracle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were overseas that even women were conscripted into labor corps and told where they must work . Many American families learned how terrible it was to have men overseas for three years . New Zealand men were gone five years , or more . Bernard Freyberg was born in England of undistinguished parents and soon emigrated to New Zealand , where he became a dentist . He was not too successful and quit to serve as a mercenary soldier under Pancho Villa . While in the Mexican desert he heard that England had gone to war . Rushing across the Atlantic he joined the New Zealand forces in London in time to serve at Gallipoli , where under intense Turkish fire he swam the Hellespont towing a barge full of flares which lighted the way for invasion . Later , in France , while suffering from four bullet wounds , he led three forlorn charges and in a fourth took a fortified village . Later he performed other wild feats and won all the medals a soldier could win . He was hailed by Sir James Barrie , a specialist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . " Now he has returned to New Zealand as the personal representative of the King , a post previously held by titled nobodies . Even the conservative press applauded the appointment , observing , " Sir Bernard is a happy choice , even if somewhat revolutionary . " Today when Freyberg stands stiffly at attention during public functions he is often attended by a stumpy , square-jawed chap who is generally conceded to have been the bravest soldier in World War II . Charles Upham was a schoolteacher , but his behavior under fire seems incredible . Once he rose from a raging attack of dysentery to lead his men against insuperable odds , " thus becoming the first skeleton ever to win the Victoria Cross . " In fact , he is the only fightingman ever to win two Victoria Crosses in a row , and he was even recommended for a third ! But the generals said halt : " Three would be too many , even for a New Zealander . " When he returned homep258his nation offered him a gift of $30,000 , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of the blokes who did n't get back . " Now he tends cows on his small farm , a quiet , sawed-off chap who might serve as the model for the typical New Zealander we 've been talking about . The nation lives by trading agricultural products to Great Britain . The first Merino sheep were landed by Captain Cook in 1773 , and within a hundred years the wool industry supported the country . Smart scientists discovered that New Zealand 's grass could be the world 's best except for a lack of cobalt in the soil . Now the blue mineral is added each year , sometimes by airplane , and the pasturage is spectacularly rich . Great sheep ranches , called stations , run Merinos on the sides of mountain ranges . Lilybank is typical , a station of 70,000 acres and 6,000 sheep nestled between 10,000-foot peaks at the head of a superb lake . In the fall ( April  --  June ) the Merinos are mustered out of the mountains for eye clipping  --  so they can see  --  and belly stripping  --  sotheir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the rounding up teams of three comb the mountains . Top man walks along the slopes at the 7,000-foot line , tossing stones at the sheep to keep them moving downhill . He signals his two companions by setting fires on mountain peaks , and upon him depends the thoroughnessof the muster . During winter ( July  --  September ) the men of Lilybank do the hard work of a sheep station . Sometimes on foot , often on snowshoes , they snow-rake , or scuff tracks through blizzards so that sheep can follow them to caches of feed . Fortunately , the Merino has learned to live through snow that would kill other sheep and has the good habit , if totally stranded , of eating wool off the backs of other sheep to stay alive . Even so , during a winter of bad snow Lilybank may lose up to 25 per cent of its flock and in 1895 lost every one . In spring ( October  --  December ) Lilybank becomes a flowering wonderland , and since Merinos lamb best when left alone , the men rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . In Summer ( January  --  March ) the shearing takes place . Since the climate is rugged , all shearing is done by hand so as to leave about an inch of wool to warm the sheep . This is slow work , for a strippingmachine could handle 16o sheep while hand clippers take carep259of too . But since few Merinos are ever sold for meat , careful clippingis the most important part of the year 's work . The profit would be greater if it were not for the kca , a magnificentnative parrot with a two-inch scimitar beak and a passion for sheep fat . In teams the keas hunt down ewes . A big bird will dart down , fix his talons in the wool and then slash his beak deep into the ewe 's back muscles . The terrified animal starts to dash about , whereupon the rest of the team screams with infuriating joy . Again and again the cruel rider shifts position and slashes at the back until the agonized sheep falls prostrate , when the keas strip off the kidney fat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station hands will track a kea crew for days . Today the dairy industry of North Island has passed wool in national importance , and many New Zealanders predict that soon huge refrigerator ships will run between Auckland and San Franciscocarrying " our beautiful butter north . " But no matter how important dairying becomes , the sheep industrywill always be remembered as the one which gave New Zealand its character . The lore of the top man , tramping the lonely peaks , is strong in New Zealand blood . For example , touching Lilybank on the east , high among mountain passes , is the most famous of stations , Mesopotamia . Here in 186o appeared a scrawny Englishman with $12,000 of his father 's money . He had many wild and moving experiences , including a hundred-mile dash through a snowstorm to the land office where he defended his station against a fraudulent claim , after which " he astonished everyone by working off his excitementplaying Bach 's Fugues for two hours . " He was obsessed by the mountains that fringed Mesopotamia , and from his speculationsconcerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler . The young social dreamer was successful as a station owner and in three years doubled his investment , yet locally he is remembered for the fact that when he built his thatched hut he stupidly placed the thatches upside down so that all the rain ran inside , " an extraordinary thing for so clever a man to do . " New Zealand 's legendary hero also came from the sheep country and gave his name to vast reaches of magnificent upland moors . In , 1845 Queen Victoria visited Aberdeen in Scotland , and the city fathers , wishing to provide an unforgettable feast , advertised for some prime cattle , whereupon an enterprising young Scot named.  |p260John  Mackenzie went from one farm to another and stole the prize steers , delivering them boldly for the Queen 's table . Then he hopped the next boat for Australia . He wound up in New Zealand and disappeared into the unexploredwastelands where sheep were beginning to graze . He became a poetic figure , moving among the great mountains with a mournful bullock and a mute dog . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ferry across . At night he pitched his camp where no men had been before . Soon rich station owners began to miss their sheep , and it was deduced that John Mackenzie was driving them off in thousand-lot hauls . Rewards were offered , but sly John and his dog were too cautious . Then they were caught with more than a thousand marked sheep . The crafty Scot escaped but was captured at the coast as he tried to board a ship . He knocked his jailer out with a length of leg chain and was recaptured only after having a bullet pumped through him . Twice thereafter he broke loose and once he was dragged back to prison trussed up like a pig . Finally the Government decided it would be cheaper to pardon him than to have him wrecking the jail each month , so John Mackenzie was banished from New Zealand , but it is rumored that he sneaked back to his wild upland moors where his ghost may still be seen at times , tramping the barren Mackenzie Country with his silent dog and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impatient with the sheep men . Now the emphasis is all upon manufacturing , with the nation trying vainly to make all sorts of items which common sense would tell her to import from either England or Australia . ( Any importationfrom America is inconceivable at present . ) The result is close to economic stagnation and has resulted in a marked decline from what was once " the highest standard of living yet attained by all the people of any nation . " The competition for labor is ridiculous . Employers must bribe help to work and are lucky if beginners stay long enough to learn a trade . Consider one advertisement of thirty-nine lines , begging girls to come to work . Twenty-five lines relate to the bonus system , the newly decorated tea room , provisions for time off , assurance of constant radio music during working hours plus the plea , " Bring your parents with you if you would like their opinion of the workingconditions . " The ad ends : " What Girl Could Ask For More ? "  |p261A|p|parently  many do , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free permanent waves , daily carfare , taxis home on late nights , tickets to the movies twice a week , and  --  illegally -- an extra two weeks ' pay above vacation pay if the girls will consent to report to work on Monday after the annual holiday ! A totally inadequate labor force plus a rigid 4o-hour week means that New Zealand is underproduced in everything except mutton , butter and wool . For example , the country has immense deposits of coal , yet coal is often imported from Australia or even the United States . There is abundance of wool , but carpeting is simply not available . There are fine forests , but no lumber ; great wealth , but not enough homes . At Foxdown Farm near Timaru I watched Bob Ford work 1200 acres , run 3200 Romney sheep for mutton and ioo Aberdeen-Angus cattle for beef . He had no hired help . Could get none . Bob and his wife worked fourteen hours a day , seven days a week . They made a pile of money , but they were burning themselves out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living has drooped pitifully . In ten homes where husbands earned what would be $8,000 a year in America , only one wife had both a refrigerator and a washing machine . In three of the homes there was neither , yet both husband and wife desperately wanted both . None available . Until recently New Zealanders refused to believe that their living standards had slipped . Then , in 1950 , they played host to the Empire Games , which brought newsmen from all parts of the Commonwealth . The result was some of the most shocking criticism a countryhas ever had to absorb , and all of it delivered by members of the family . An Australian : " I get an over-all impression of gloom and depression . All public services are shockingly out of date . " A Londoner : " Even our English cities , with austerity and restrictions , are immeasurably more cheerful , better equipped and better servicedfor out-of-town visitors . " Another Australian : " The transport system is painfully obsolete . " A Canadian : " New Zealand does not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than third-rate in Vancouver . " Another Canadian : " Service in stores and shops is poor . Goods are shoddy . . . If this is a vicious indictment of Auckland as a tourist town , it is vicious only because it is the only honest impression one can take away . " An American : " In five days I visited five cities and could not find a single hotelp262room . I slept in dingy rooms or in none at all . What was disturbing was that hotel clerks were outraged that any sensible human being should simply step up to a hotel desk and expect a room ! " New Zealand was shocked by the reports of its friends . In the discussions that followed this seemed to be the common explanation : " Everyone 's got it too easy . We 've all got minimum wages , social security . Nobody gives a hang . " Actually , many thoughtful New Zealanders have known for a long time that their socialistic paradise would n't stand up under careful scrutiny . There is much that is truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only very hard work will eliminate the latter . The question then arises : " Who will do the work ? " New Zealand is dangerously underpopulated . ( World average 41 per square mile . United States 48 . Japan 532 . New Zealand i6 . ) Steps are being taken to increase immigration , but the fact that New Zealand is exclusively British means that only British immigrants are welcome . In Dunedin a committee facing this problem seriously passed the three followingresolutions : ( 1 ) Our population lack is critical . Something must be done . ( 2 ) But since we are of British stock , only British immigrantsshould be sought . ( 3 ) And since Australia is so much worse off than we ( less than three to the square mile ) let 's wait until they get all they need ! Tragically , of every hundred Englishmen who do arrive as immigrants , as many as forty go right back home . Their reasons : no houses to live in ; the beer is too weak ; we ca n't stand those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon . Because of the fortyhourweek , no stores of any kind  --  except fruit , candy , hot food  --  may open on Saturday . You can not buy groceries , meat , milk , or bread . No haircuts , no doctor visits , no dentist , no shoes repaired . You can buy gasoline only in proved emergencies and then from only one station in each city . You also need an emergency to warrantsending a telegram after i 2 noon . Telephone and train services are curtailed . Few restaurants are open . Life comes to a deathly standstill . The best description came from a workingman : " We have two Sundays a week , except that on Saturday we have horse racing . " The result of knocking two full days out of every week , plus working only about thirty-three hours out of the forty-hourp263week , is that economic production has inevitably deteriorated . It is quite possible that the social legislation of Seddon and Savage has reached the point of diminishing returns . Yet I myself can not wholly subscribe to the harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wonderfully pleasant . Each home has a garden of glorious flowers . Evergreen trees abound and make the landscape lovely . The sea is always available and no home can be far from mountains and clear lakes . New Zealand food is superb , even if the cooking is apt to be pretty dreadful . There are , however , five unique delicacies : soup made from sauteed toheroa clams , pronounced by the Prince of Wales to be " the finest soup ever made , " an understatement ; grilled mutton bird , a baby sea fowl whose parents cram its rubber belly with so many fresh fish that it can not move , so that when it is cooked it tastes like chicken with a streak of trout ; Colonial Goose , which is strong mutton sliced wafer thin and served with onion stuffing and an almost black gravy ; the best little tea cakes in the world ; and whitebait . Gourmets can go into trances over a mess of fresh whitebait , pitched into a batter of whipped eggs with a touch of onion and fried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in New Zealand is appealing . In addition to the two Sundays there are frequent stops for tea , a willingness to yarn at any time , plus an unbounded hospitality . New Zealand childrenare kept in school uniforms till they are seventeen or eighteen on the theory that if a boy is in knee pants till that age he wo n't be in a hurry to mature into a criminal . The plan works , for the crime rate is low . The care of children has always been a special New Zealand concern . In the late nineteenth century , Truby King , a childless doctor at a mental institution , became fascinated by his hobby of feeding pigs , on whom he developed scientific nutrition tables . After adoptinga waif he found that his pig principles worked equally well on humans , and within a few years he had pioneered child-care centers under the direction of the Plunket Society , so named after the wife of a Governor-General . Later , young girls were encouraged to study child care and today Karitanes  --  named after the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of " Helping the mother and saving the child . " When a Karitane reports , and they are in great demand , she assumes sole charge of thep264child and soon she has it gurgling and fat . Karitanes are neither nurses nor servants . They usually marry young and make wonderfulmothers . To them is given much credit for the fact that New Zealand babies are unusually healthy . Actually , all young things seem to grow fabulously in this country . Animals have been brought here from all over the world , and because New Zealand had no natural predatory creatures , introducedanimals have multiplied enormously . American deer increased so freely that now the Government must hire cullers who roam the valleys shooting does , whose carcasses are not even gathered . The rabbit is a national pest , having made deserts out of much of the South Island . Goats , pigs , opossums , sparrows , hawks and even wallabies ( midget kangaroos ) have all found New Zealand a bonanza and are now pests . Even plants run wild in this fertile land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years the magnificentyellow shrub was a national menace , engulfing whole fields like a sweeping golden flame . But there was one introduction which has made New Zealand famous wherever sportsmen gather . The rainbow trout was brought down from Canada and the United States . Instantly it took to the cold , dashing rivers where no predators fed upon its young . Soon the famous game fish grew to gigantic size and New Zealand becameknown , quite properly , as the Sportsman 's Paradise . To see this wonderland at its best you must stop a while at Alan Pye 's Huka Lodge , at the northern end of Lake Taupo . Here , beside the swift-flowing Waikato River near a gorge where waters roar between rocks , Pye has built a fisherman 's retreat that can have few equals anywhere . In a homey lodge he serves remarkablemeals : fresh chicken , trout for breakfast , all the eggs you can eat , steak , always two immense desserts with four pitchers of cream that has to be ladled out . Nearby a thermal spring pumps mildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evergreens so that fishermen and their wives can go bathing nude . But food and hot baths are not the attraction at Huka Lodge , for in the river and in Lake Taupo abound monstrous rainbows . The average fish caught at Pye 's weighs about seven pounds , and each will feed four people . Above the fire are two mounted beauties that tipped the scales at more than 12 , but Pye himself , a red-faced , weather-bitten Irishman  --  all famous New Zealanders were bornp265somewhere else  --  says , " Those fish are not to be regarded . The champion picked out of this river was 26 pounds . And mark you , the flesh was firm . They are n't lazy , the New Zealand trout . " For years Pye has conducted a running feud with the Tongariro crowd upstream . They fish the legendary Tongariro River , termed " the most perfect reach of trout water ever known , " where each pool bears a famous name : Vera 's , Swirl , Nursing , Stump , Log and Mud . Pye used to insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has said little , for evil luck has fallen upon the Tongariro pools . To the west three great volcanoes have been throwing torrents of volcanic ash into the air , and prevailing winds have carried it across the river . Its effect upon the superlative Tongariro trout is unpredictable ; for the present the fish have grown sluggish . The water near Pye 's lodge is so far unaffected , but he does not gloat . For if the volcanoes continue to erupt , the ash could well destroy all the trout . In the meantime , Pye provides near perfect fishing for $5 a day , all expenses covered . He also has a remarkable cottage which costs more and which provides the finest accommodation in New Zealand . He will not tell you how he happens to have such quarters , for he has not yet got over the shock of acquiring them . It happened this way . About fifteen years ago a handsome United States naval officer became fascinated by the fishing at Pye 's and prevailed upon Alan to lease a corner of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built and decorated at princely expense . Year after year the young officer , now a full commander , came vacationing to try the trout . When war broke out he served with distinction as liaison with New Zealand forces . Then peace came and with it the shocking news from New York ! The handsome naval officer , this favored man , had been proved beyond doubt to be involved in a worldwide narcotics ring , to which he was himself a slave . By God 's grace he died shortly after the story broke , and now his fishing lodge , more beautiful than ever , stands by the trout-filled Waikato , waiting for other fishermen . I have known New Zealand in many weathers and I have served with its quiet men in most corners of the Pacific . I have never met people more deeply convinced that theirs is the one good land . But whenever I think I understand even slightly what makes this radical/conservative country tick , I am brought up sharp by some new experience . When I started to write this essay I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown to love : placid Christchurch with its English cathedral and terribly stuffy manner . Here on the broad plains of Canterbury I felt that I had come at last to the true meaning of New Zealand : English forever , reluctant to move ahead , confirmed in the defense of human dignity . Then I turned one more corner and stumbled upon the fastest-growing religion in conservative Christchurch . There it was ! A store-front chapel with the pastor 's Model T Ford parked outside and on the walls the mystical words : PEACE ! PEACE ! PEACE ! FATHER DIVINE !  |p267New  Zealand rushed the cream of her manhood into Africa and Crete ; then watched helplessly as Japan crept down the islands . THE LAST TIME the family ever met together was in Augustof 1939 , when father returned to New Zealand for Barbara 's wedding . He brought the Nestor into Wellington Harbor , where a great fuss was made over the British warship , for a spirit of great excitement then pervaded the country . That very night he boarded the South Island ferry and experiencedthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toss upon the first waters he had ever sailed . A stranger approachedhim as he stood by the rail and said , " My apologies , sir . But are n't you Captain Harry Neville of Christchurch ? " Neville immediately stiffened to discourage familiarity and grunted that he was . The stranger slapped his arms together in the cold wintry breeze and asked , " Shall we be giving Jerry hell again ? " Captain Neville was not a tall man , but when he drew back his head in British Navy style and stared down his nose at the intruder , the latter could do nothing but apologize for his inquisitiveness and go below . His place , however , was taken almost immediately by a very thin woman who cried , " It 's Captain Harry Neville ! You home for Barbara 's wedding ? " He ticked his braided visor and indicated that her guess was correct . The woman laughed and said , " I 'll wager you 've never met the young man . Let me assure you , Captain , he 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , against his will , relaxed and asked , " You know the boy ? " " Know him ? " she echoed . " He 's my nephew ! " With due modesty she assured the captain that Barbara 's intended husband came from one of Christchurch 's finest families . She said , " Mark 's handsome , like his father . You would n't know his father ,  |p268but  he was my brother . Mark attended a very fine school . " She dropped her voice modestly and added , " In England , you know . " Then she asked apprehensively , " Surely , there wo n't be another war , will there ? " Captain Neville stared at her precisely as before and in some confusionshe left . For more than an hour he peered into the darkness of Cook Strait . He loved this turbulent water . Even its name was clean and simple . Had a good English ring . As a boy , upon this ferry , he had decided to strike for a commission in the Royal Navy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also knew that the best New Zealand men had always struck for the Navy , the real Navy that is , the Royal Navy out of London and Plymouth . He had made it , an awkward little tow-headed youth from New Zealand competing with the best young men of England . Then , in the succeeding years , he had often returned to New Zealand , always to sail across Cook Strait to his home in Christchurch . It was on this ferry that he had heard of Anne 's birth during the First ' World War . Later , he had been chasing Count Luckner through the South Pacific when he got the leave during which his second child , Barbara , had been conceived . In years of peace he had often left his various commands to spend some time with his family at Christchurch , so that his wife teased him with a quiet joke . " Nine months after Harry 's leave there 's bound to be a new child . " " Navy tradition , " he had growled . " Dammit , Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They had named their first daughter Anne , after Harry 's mother . The second child was Barbaraafter Sara 's sister . Having started with the alphabet , Sara , who believed in omens , insisted that the third child be Christopher , the next Delia , and the baby Evelyn . At first this nonsense had offended Harry Neville , but on distant stations it helped him to keep the children straight , and during the night watch he could run down the family in order . Anne was his favorite , tall , serious , reserved . Barbara was the energetic one and it was appropriate that she should be the first to marry . Christopher was a good lad , but Harry never mentioned to his family the secret disappointment he felt in Kit . He had hoped the boy might follow him in the British Fleet , but Kit had n't the ability . He was n't stupid . Harry was first to insist that Kit was n't stupid , but he was n't top-flight either , and the home fleet could accept only the cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ragtag and bobtail in Captain Harry 's judgment . Next there was Delia . . . He always stopped at her name . She was the glorious beauty , but no one could ever be certain of Delia . She would be eighteen now , he figured , and vaguely he wished that it were Delia rather than Barbara who was being married , because everyone knew that Barbara could take care of herself . Then he broke into a quiet chuckle . Evelyn ! Bright , happy , outspoken , born long after the others . Any father would be proud of such a child . He had last seen her as a pig-tailed girl of eight gravely telling him that Edward was now king and that every good Englishman owed strict allegiance to their new King Edward . A seaman presented himself , saluted , and said that the ferry captain , hearing that Captain Harry Neville , R.N. , was aboard , wished to extend the hospitality of the bridge . At first Neville was disposed to send his regrets , but he felt that as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drew his greatcoat about his shoulders and stamped up the ladder . " Cap'n Neville , " he mumbled , saluting . The ferry captain was in no way obsequious . " Shall we be having trouble with the Boche ? " he asked directly . Now Neville felt himself to be talking with an equal . " Jerry 's acting a bit stiff , " he said cautiously . " Knows he ca n't whip us , but his aircraft might knock us about a bit . " " Very determined adversary , the Boche . " The two sea captains nodded sagely and then Neville excused himself and turned in . The morning was clean and fair . He hurried on deck to greet Littleton Harbor , a deep , winding volcanic cut in the side of a massive hill . It was , he thought , the best harbor he knew . The harbor of Christchurch . In great excitement he piled his gear aboard a creaking train that tunneled through the hill to deliver the ferry passengers to Christchurchproper . When the whistle blew and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for getting home in troubled times was very good , but when he finally stood before his family  --  all five children and sniffling Sara  --  he was as coldly erect as they had always remembered him . Sedately he shook hands with his wife and then planted a kiss on the forehead of each of his four daughters . With a brisk snap he shook Christopher 's hand and said , " I see you 're in the Army . "  |p270His  son laughed . " Had n't brains enough to get into the so-called senior service . " Captain Neville froze to attention . He had always been repelled and offended by Army jokes against the Royal Navy . " I would be pleased , " he said , " if you would not use that ridiculous phrase . " " Oh , Father ! " Barbara protested . " Sometimes the Navy is a pain in the neck . " Captain Neville stared at his daughter . Less than a year later Barbararecalled this look when word reached Christchurch that Harry Neville 's light cruiser Nestor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier German from the convoy routes . True , both the Nestor and its captain had been lost , but many navy letters reached Neville 's family , and each said the same thing : " We who knew Harry never anticipated that he would do other than preserve the best traditions of his service . " His death was a terrible blow to his wife . Sara Neville had never been a strong woman , but she had been so dedicated to her husband that she had always conserved her energy for his infrequent visits . Then she blossomed into a gay sprite , chaffing him , idolizing him , drawing him out about his various exploits . But when he left she relapsed into pregnancy and invalidism . It now became apparent to the family that she would never recoverfrom her husband 's death . The Nevilles lived in a modest cottage in Ferrymead , a suburb chosen because it overlooked a broad and salty estuary . When they were young , the children had gazed upon this arm of the sea , imagining that they were in contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after day , staring vacantly at the ocean which had played so powerful a part in her life . There was an extended family discussion as to whether Anne or Barbara should assume responsibility for the home at Ferrymead , but since Anne had a good job in a Christchurch store , it was decided that Barbara should become the mother , for although she was married she had no home of her own . Her husband had behaved as New Zealand men will . Shy , brave , morbidly attached to England where he had been educated , Mark Forbes had volunteered for duty on the day Germany marched into Poland , and now he served in Africa.  |p271So  his wife Barbara took over the cottage at Ferrymead and purchaseda large map of Europe  --  plus the north coast of Africa  --  and on it she followed the fortunes of war , guessing at where Mark might be . They had known each other only briefly , had lived togetherless than a month , and Barbara sometimes had a feeling of unreality as she placed a slender pin to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housemother only a few months when Christopher , too , left New Zealand . At twenty he was a cocky , witty lad quite unlike his father . He astounded his sisters on his last night at home by leaning back with his feet on the ottoman and announcing , " Anne , when you quit work tomorrow I want you to walk along Colombo Street and assure all the sheilas that Kit ' 11 be home before long . " Anne frowned and said , " That 's a most beastly word , Kit . " " I agree , " he laughed . " But all the same , you give the sheilas my message . " At the station when Christopher left , Anne said , " Now behave yourself , Kit . Remember that people will know you 're Father 's son . " " You remember to tell the sheilas ! " Kit teased , and Anne sniffled in her handkerchief , whispering to Barbara that she was worried about Kit , he was so irreverent . Barbara did n't worry about Kit . She worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no young men , preferred knowing none . That night Barbara wrote to Mark in Africa : " I 'm sure no man can ever understand how a girl feels when her older sister is determined to stay an old maid . Anne is one of the finest girls I 've known . She was the one who saved me . As you pointed out , I have a beastly temper at times , but it would have been unbearableexcept for Anne 's patient instruction . If I 'm even fifty per cent civilized it 's because of her . That 's why it hurts me terribly when I see her shutting up her life like an old house by the sea , closing it against a winter that might never end . Then I think of you , Mark , and of how you saved me from becoming such a person , and I am forever indebted . When I move your straight and very erect pin about at night , guessing where you are , I love you very , very much . "  |p272In  the morning after this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting married , but Anne blushed deeply and said she would have thought that Barbara would have had other things to worry about . This rebuff , and others , made Barbara wonder if Anne were deficient in emotion , but this likelihood was dispelled when news arrived of Christopher 's death at Narvik , in Norway . Barbara was not at home when the telegram arrived , and the full brunt of it fell upon Anne . She guessed at once that either Kit or Mark had been killed and for a moment she held the message in her hand . Then , with a deep breath , she ripped it open and devoured the contents in a glance . Quickly , as if caught spying on death , she refolded the telegram and pressed it back into shape . Young Kit was dead . The sheilas on Colombo Street should know of this . Everyone in Ferrymead should know that happy young Kit was dead . Carefully she stuffed the telegram into her pocket and then dressed for the street . Barbara met her at the door and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before you go , help me with these packages . " Then , seeing the dull look in her sister 's eyes she asked , " Anne ! What 's the matter ? Is it Mother ? " She dropped her packages and dashed into the front room where she saw with relief that her mother was still staring at the estuary . " Afternoon , my darling ! " Barbara whispered , patting her mother 's white hands . " Hello , Anne , " the wandering woman said in a very tired voice . She could no longer differentiate among her children . " I was afraid you were ill , " Barbara said . " I 'm all right . " Relieved , Barbara returned to the kitchen , but there she saw Anne staring at her from the doorway , the scattered packages still on the floor . " What is it , Anne ? " she cried . Anne took the telegram from her pocket and carried it , like a ghost , to the kitchen table . She let it fall and then sank into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumbled . " He 's dead . " Barbara unfolded the message with shaking hands and read it twice . She put her hand to her forehead and muttered , " Narvik ? Narvik ? We had n't even a pin at Narvik . " She went to her map and searched vainly for the unknown name . " It 's not on the map , " she said.  |p273At  this Anne began to cry , asking , " What does it matter where they die ? They 'll all die in some horrible lost village . " " Oh , Anne ! Please ! " " It 's all right with you , Barbara . You do n't seem to have any feelings . " " Darling ! " Barbara cried , falling to her knees beside her stricken sister . " I lie awake at night and pray . I know what terror is . I 've prayed for Father and Kit . " " And one by one , " Anne sobbed . " One by one they 'll be lost . What is this meaningless business about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is meaning to it , " Barbara whispered . " Why ? How ? Our men running off to die in Norway and Africa . . . " She stopped and looked up in horror . " Oh , Barbara ! Forgive me . I 'm sick with fear . " " We have a right to go on hoping that there is meaning to it , " Barbara said , hiding even in her own mind the word Africa . " Have you told Mother ? " " No , " Anne said . " Will you tell the others ? " Barbara said that she would , and forthwith started to get supper . She found this kitchen , with its warm and cheery fire , its table soiled with much use , a comforting place to be in time of death . There had been much life and goodness in this kitchen , and she had grown to understand why women came to look upon the least attractiveroom in their home as home itself . " Please God , " she whispered to herself as she worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mark . " Immediately she shivered as she thought of telling Delia and Evelyn about Kit 's death . But when Delia burst into the kitchen , with a fine happy grin there was no thought of death . " It 's happened ! " she cried . " What has ? " Barbara asked , lighting a burner for tea . " I 'm engaged ! " Delia shouted , twirling about the room . She stopped suddenly and asked , " Is n't anyone pleased ? What 's the matter with you two ? " Quickly Barbara caught up the telegram and said , " We 're delighted , Deel . Are n't we , Anne ? But who 's the . . . " She stopped , embarrassed that she should have to ask the name of the man to whom her own sister had become engaged . " Who 's the lucky man ? " she asked weakly.  |p274Delia  sensed the impropriety of her announcement and stuck out her thin , firm chin . Raising her blonde head defiantly she said , " Cobber Phil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the insult by crying , " Cobber Phil ! He 'll be a jolly sort to have about the house . " But not even Barbara could force any real enthusiasm into her congratulations . She knew Cobber Phil , an uncouth , unwashed , very un-English young man who had knocked about Australia a bit  --  whence his name  --  picking up the worst color of that strange land but none of its character . No one liked Cobber Phil , except possibly Delia , and if Captain Harry had lived or if Sara Neville were in possession of her mind , a man like the Cobber would never have been permitted to enter the house . But war had denuded New Zealand of decent men , and Barbara said , " Cobber 's a jolly sort . " Then followed a cruel , silent moment during which each sister in the kitchen understood exactly what the other felt . Barbara , sensing this to be a critical moment in Delia 's life within the family , laughed and said , " We 're happy for you , Deel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , as if this easy question would permit Delia to swing back into normal small talk about the wedding , but Anne broke the spell by asking acidly , " Yes , when will the marriage be ? " Delia flushed and snapped at her critical sister , " What 's bothering you , Anne ? You parading the fact you hate men ? I do n't . " " I know you do n't , " Anne said , adding unfairly , " and the only thing wrong with me is that Kit 's dead . " Delia stared at Anne for a shocked second and then held out her hands to Barbara . " I 've been so afraid about Kit . Ever since Father . . . " She sat down dazedly and brushed her hair back from her forehead . " What shall we do about Evelyn ? " she asked . On the spur of the moment Barbara said , " You 'd better tell her , Deel . You 're closer to her than we are . " So when Evelyn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne from the kitchen . They could hear the little girl crying and Anne said , " I do n't like leaving Evelyn with Delia . " " Why not ? " " The less Deel has to do with the child the better . "  | " I agree , " Barbara said . " But Delia needs us very much right now . " " There 's no good worrying about Delia , " Anne said . " She 's lost . " " Oh , Anne ! How rotten ! Even to think that . " " Wait , " Anne said . " You 'll see . " To her surprise Barbara caught Anne by the shoulders and whisperedharshly , " Look here ! Delia is going to be married in this house . You and I are going to be nice to Cobber Phil and make him think he 's one of us . It 's our only chance to save Delia . . . from .. . well , from becoming a very unpleasant person . " It was hard for the Nevilles to stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his own stories and called Anne " old girl . " He was the kind of New Zealander who made the girls regret their ancestorshad left England . With no knowledge of English ways and no command of the English tongue , he leaned back in Captain Neville 's old chair , plopped his feet on the ottoman and offered free advice to Lord Wavell as to the conduct of desert warfare . Now even euphemisms were surrendered . Anne stormed one night after Cobber Phil had advised her how to knit socks , " The only reason I tolerate that boor , Barbara , is to keep my sister off the streets . " This time Barbara did not argue back . There was considerable relief , therefore , when Cobber Phil was drafted and sent to garrison duty in Singapore . " A fine spot for him , " Anne said when the ferry had left . " He 's so far from the fightinghe ca n't do anybody any harm . " She did , however , comment on a fact that she was sure Barbara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased as the rest that her husband was finally off to war . As a gesture Anne brought home a cheap little map of the Pacific and a very bright red pin which indicated the Cobber in Singapore . He sent illiterate letters reporting that " the Chinese girls who came down from Shanghai are very immortal . " Delia laughed and said , " That Cobber ! " She said she was happy he 'd drawn Singapore instead of Africa . For it was now that the New Zealand armies started the great oscillating battles across the desert . The pins in Barbara 's map moved with sickening speed toward Alexandria , then with bounding fervor back toward Tobruk , and in one such surging battle Mark Forbes was killed . When the news reached Ferrymead , Barbara was half-alerted for it , but she found that no one could be totally brave when such in/formation was afoot . It was , actually , more than she could bear . At first she tried behaving normally with her sisters , but it was no use . She threw her hands over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her grief embarrassed Anne , who excused herself and went back to the store . It was Delia who took over . She led Barbara to a sofa and covered her with an afghan . Then she sent Evelyn to school and returned to kneel by her sister . " You 'd better get to your job , " Barbara warned . " I 'm chucking the job , " Delia said , straightening the afghan . " You 're what ? " " Do n't get excited , Babs . It 's just that Christchurch ... It seems so awful . " " I know . " " The men all away . Dying in places you 've never heard of . " " It 's all for a purpose , " Barbara insisted . " Daddy was no fool . " She paused and added , " Neither was Kit . . . nor Mark . " " Did you lie awake at night . . . wondering ? " " Of course I did , Deel ! " " You never liked Cobber Phil much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We did n't know him well , " Barbara evaded . " I did n't know him , either . Lately I 've discovered that I hardly feel married at all . " Barbara was frightened . Quickly she said , " When Cobber comes home all that will change . He 'll live here with us . . . " " He 'll have to , " Delia confessed . " He 'll never keep a job very long . " " That 's all right ! " Barbara insisted . " He 's a lot of fun . And the family 's got to stick together . " She held Delia 's delicately beautiful head in her arms , and for a moment the two girls recaptured the old fellowship they had known as youngsters , when they sailed small boats on the estuary while Anne stood on shore nervously predictingcatastrophe . Delia said , " You were right . I see it now . Cobber Phil 's a ridiculousman . How could I ever have married him ? " Barbara asked , " Are you taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " " I 'm going to Wellington . The Navy Office . "  | " But Deel ! ' Wellington ! Why ? " " Because I ca n't bear Christchurch another day . " " Darling , listen carefully .

I wo n't be frozen in Christchurch . I wo n't ! " Barbara rose on one elbow and placed her arm about Deel . " What has happened ? " she asked soberly . Delia started to cry into the crook of her sister 's arm . " You would n't understand . It 's the terrible loneliness of Christchurch . Of all New Zealand . A country without men . You walk down Colombo Street after tea . All women . Nothing but Kit 's sheilas . It 's like suspendinglife for two years . And it 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank back upon the sofa . What Deel had said was true . A nation without men . They had slipped away quietly at first , the professionals like her father , then the willing young heroes like her brother , next the gallant ones like Mark , and finally even the ne'er-do-wells like Cobber Phil . They had been sucked out of the valleys and the seaports , leaving behind a civilizationthat was ugly and barren . It was a brave civilization  --  chin up , old girl  --  but it was barren . Barbara contemplated her next remark for a long time . It might sever Delia from the family permanently . On the other hand , it might be just the word of caution that would save the girl . " Deel , " she said cautiously , " I think you 're going to Wellington because there 'll be men there . Deel , you 're terribly attractive . Do be careful , darling . " Delia rose from the floor , brushed off her dress and said nothing . She was twenty , not so tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had naturally blonde hair which she wore short about her exquisitely molded head . Her very thin lips were parted in a hesitant smile which showed her very white teeth . But Barbara noticed only how translucent Delia 's skin was , how perilously near the surface her blood vessels were . Impulsively Barbara rose from the sofa and embracedher sister . " Deel , " she whispered , " do be careful . With so many of us dead , you are the one person left . . . " But before Delia could escape Christchurch the entire Pacific explodedwith the terrifying abruptness of Pearl Harbor . At first therep278was a flush of joy when it was realized that at last America had to join the battle , assuring ultimate victory . But this elation changed to a cold and creeping fear when it became apparent that Japan was going to conquer , almost unopposed , the islands north of New Zealand . Day by day , with horrible speed , like a spider dashing down upon its prey , the Japanese swept south , almost to the gates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thousands of men had been slaughtered or forced into jungle labor gangs where they died without medicine . The Government officially informed Delia that Cobber Phil was missing . Anne said , " Most missing men . . . that is , if they are n't at sea .. . Well , anyway , most missing men turn up safe , Deel . " Barbara , who knew that Cobber 's disappearance might be a boon to her sister , elected to say nothing , but then was astonished at her callousness and said , " I think Cobber will be all right . I think he 'll be back here with us some day . " There now seemed to be always that aching pain in the kitchen at Ferrymead as the Japs came closer and closer . There was a special agony in New Zealand at this time because of the fact that her defenselessness had been caused by her own gallantry . Captain Harry Neville 's Nestor might have helped oppose the Jap fleet , but it had been sunk in the South Atlantic , protecting England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had died in the desert defending Alexandria . Kit was dead in Norway and even the Cobber was lost in Singapore , defending God knows what . At home there was nothing . Nothing . The days of that dreadful autumn were rainy , cold and dismal . Barbara tried her best  --  in the house of five women and no men  --  to keep spirits alive . She baked special goodies for their teas , instituted a program of reading each night at least four poems from The OxfordBook of English Verse , but the love lyrics were so lacerating to the heart that by common consent this was stopped . And week by week the Japs came closer . The great tenseness of the time was broken by Delia 's abrupt departure for Wellington . She did not even bid her sisters good-bye , but fled the lonely cottage by the estuary . And then titanic hope burst like a mighty spring flower all across New Zealand . The First Marine Division landed from America , andp279with it came astonishing stores of equipment , superb young men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world nothing quite like this . To be sure , supporting armies had often landed on allied lands to help local forces , but never before had a strange army come to take the place of every available man . Never before had all the military population of a nation gone off to blazing foreign fields in support of a friend , only to have the enemy sneak down upon the undefended homeland . An impassioned sigh of deliverance went up from New Zealand . They saw in the powerful and handsome FirstMarDiv the flower of American strength , comparable to the acme of New Zealand strength that had been the first to leave for Africa . It was always the finest men who left home first in time of war , and New Zealand recognized this fact . The Neville girls would never forget their first sight of the Americans . Evelyn , then fourteen and an increasingly lovely child , came bursting into the kitchen screaming , " You should see them ! " " Who ? " Barbara asked quietly . " The Yanks ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , prosaically , she said , " Well , it 's about time . They 've been about it long enough . " The two girls bundled their mother up so that her feet would not freeze and then they slipped off to the city , where they found a convoy of military trucks in the central square . Lounging upon them were the tallest , cleanest-teethed , smilingest men Barbara had ever seen . Against her will tears came into her eyes and Evelyn teased , " You silly ! What are you crying for ? I think they 're cute ! " This chance remark was Barbara 's first warning . And when she looked up from drying her eyes to find that one of the Americans was making signs to Evelyn , she whisked her sister home and said , " Look here , young lady . There 'll be no making signs at soldiers . " Evelyn laughed at the warning but nevertheless appeared in the kitchen some time later with the startling news : " Four girls in Ferrymead are pregnant . " " Evelyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're pregnant , " Evelyn replied . " Do you suppose they 'll marry the Yanks ? "  | " No , " Barbara said simply . " That 's what so terrible about war , Evelyn . They do n't usually marry . " Articles of complaint began to appear in the newspapers concerning the conduct of the American troops and one night Anne came home flushed and trembling . " A great oaf ! Could n't even speak the language . Pestered me in the store and then grabbed me as I was leaving . Leered at me and said , You and me would be terrific in the hay , baby . ' I 'm going to call the police ! " " Please , Anne . This is war . " " That 's no excuse . " " No , it is n't an excuse . But it is an explanation . " " Barbara ! Are you condoning these barbarians ? Do you think New Zealand men are behaving like that in London ? " " Yes , " Barbara said firmly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anne 's disgust with the Americans became complete when word trickled back to Ferrymead that Delia was living with a Marine in Wellington , and soon Barbara became aware that a shocking change had taken place in New Zealand life . Daughters of impeccable familiesbegan to contract strange alliances with American soldiers . For more than thirty months there had been no men in the land , and here were dashing young fellows with free and easy ways and plenty of money . It was indeed more than average human beings could tolerate . Anne heard from a friend in Auckland that the New Zealand Government had made an arrangement with the American generals whereby mothers of illegitimate children would be paid allowances deducted officially from the father 's military pay . This callous decision shocked the nation and some older men even banded together and administered thrashings to individual Americans . One night Anne said , " That delightful Kennery girl is going to have a baby . The world I know seems to be vanishing . Just a little while ago Daddy and Mums and all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation is disintegrating . I wish the Americans would leave and never return . " And then , just as Anne 's antagonism threatened to become general , the Americans did leave . They headed north to a jungled island that would soon acquire an immortal connotation both in America and New Zealand : Guadalcanal . There were few households in either the North or the South Island that did not know some American boy who now fought onp281that desolate island . When the casualties were posted they were read , sometimes , more eagerly in Auckland and Wellington than they were in New York or Dallas . Then , as the Yanks secured their foothold on Guadalcanal , the second American invasion of New Zealand began . In many ways it was worse than the first , for it was deeply emotional , more hopelessly confused . From the feverish jungles of Guadalcanal , where there were no remedies for malaria , the sick and wounded were evacuated to New Zealand . Flyers who had been boldly aloft for five times the prescribednumber of hours limped down to Wellington for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the south came Americans who were simply worn out . They brought with them an intolerable arrogance . Having fought a very dangerous war , they were sure no other soldiers from countrieslike New Zealand had ever done so . In bars they shouted , " You ought to be goddamned thankful we saved this godforsaken wreck of a country . Where were your men ? " And from the jungles came Americans who had seen no women for three months . They met New Zealand girls who had seen no men for three years , and if the girls were happy to see strangers who had saved the country from Japan , they were known as pigs . Bright , confused and hungry girls like Delia were pigs . The burden of these insults fell very heavily on Anne . Americans would come in to buy underwear at one of her counters and they would say , " I want something frilly for a pig about this broad . " Then they would poke their fingers through the imitation silk and complain , " Why in the States you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At first Anne tried to explain that for nearly four years her country had been at war , that everything had been sent to England ; but she stopped when the Americans asked , " Why should you send stuff to England ? Why should you knuckle down to their king ? Do n't you New Zealanders have any guts ? " Anne therefore felt a surge of patriotic joy when news reached Ferrymead that Cobber Phil was living . A prisoner in Malaya , he scrawled a naive letter which he had smuggled through the lines : " Im all right . Left leg gone . No pain . Beat the yella bastids . Youre Cobber . " She said , " I 'm going to take this to Delia . I 'm fed up with Christchurchright now . Too many Yankee heroes . "  |p282She  left on the ferry one stormy night and was feeling battered about when she checked in at Delia 's hotel . She found the Prince George crowded with important-looking Americans and considered , for a moment , leaving , but instead she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Anne had seen in the stuffy Christchurch hotels . It was big and clean and modern , decorated in light colors . Delia was dressed in excellent new clothes and wore her hair long , with a ribbon in back . The girls embraced with nervous uncertainty and Delia started to comb her hair . " Are you visiting in Wellington ? " she asked casually , sitting on a big double bed which dominated the room . " No . I brought some news . " " For me ? " Delia asked suspiciously . " Yes . " " From Singapore ? " " Yes . " " Cobber ! He 's alive ! " " Yes . Lost his left leg , but he 's alive . " " Thank God ! " the younger girl cried . " He 's a strange little guy , Anne , and you never liked him . . . " " I 'm growing to understand him , " Anne said quickly . " I 've prayed for that crazy little man every night , " Delia said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Compared to the Yanks , he is . " Anne sucked in her breath and went to the window . " We were thinking . . . Barbara and I , that is . . . We were thinking that now you might want to come home . " " I ca n't , " Delia said . " But what about Cobber ? " " I think Cobber 'd understand , " Delia said nervously . " God , Deel ! What 's happened to you ? " " I do n't think you would understand , Anne . " The older girl felt dizzy and sat in an expensive armchair . She pressed her forehead to control herself and then said slowly , " You do n't seem like the same girl , Deel . I 've never told Barbara , but word 's come to Christchurch that you 've been living with Americans . Not just one . Different ones . . . " Delia rose from the bed and paced the room , clutching at her own shoulders . " It 's impossible to understand  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you and Barbara very much . I 'm only twenty-two . Cobber 's been away  --  how long ? He 'll stay away God only knows how much longer . I know you do n't like Americans . They 're not English and all that . But I would crawl on my knees to get to America  --  with almost any one of them . " " Delia ! You must n't ... " " But I 'm married and they 're going off to the islands . We sec one another until they sail . " Anne was shaken by Delia 's hopeless confession . " You must be careful , Deel . Wo n't you please come home with me ? " " No . " Anne was about to deliver some kind of ultimatum when the door hanged open and a tall , broad-shouldered man burst into the room shouting , " Hiya , Baby ! Poppa 's back ! " Delia , forgetting Anne , dashed across the room and leaped into his arms . " Andy ! You made it ! " And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " the stranger shouted . " I told the commandant he could damned well . . . " He saw Anne and stopped . " Who 's the queen ? " " Oh , this is my sister . Anne , this is Andy . " The American dropped Delia on the bed as if she were a toy doll . f lc cocked his hands on his hips and studied Anne . " Deel said she had a sister , but she did n't say the sister was a goddess . Divinely tall et cetera . " Delia laughed and said , " Do n't believe anything this galoot says . " " Galoot ? " Anne asked . " That 's Yank for cobber . " The American grabbed Anne by the arm and said , " This cobber insists you have lunch with us . " Then he stopped and studied a moment . " Whaddaya think , Deel ? Safe to take a queen like this down among them wolves ? " " I think , " said Deel , " it 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What do you mean ? " Anne asked . " The J.P.B. has everything sewed up in Wellington , " Deel explained . " Maybe one of the chairborne heroes will ask you to visit their club . " " What 's the J.P.B. ? " Anne asked  |p284As  they picked their way through the crowded dining room Andy looked sourly at the array of handsome , polished , importantlookingAmerican officers who filled the tables and whispered , " That 's the J.P.B. Joint Purchasing Board . They buy everything that 's edible for the troops up north . They are Mister God . " When they were seated Delia said , " They 're the desk soldiers . Andy 's a fighting man , so they do n't like him much . " But this time Andy seemed quite attractive to the J.P.B. men . One after another spoke overeffusively to him and finally , as he had anticipated , a particularly suave and well-fed J.P.B. man sat casually at the table and said , " Good old Andy ! When are you chaps pushing out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " Andy said , " This is Miss Anne Neville , of Christchurch . " " Lovely city , Christchurch ! " the J.P.B. man said . " Most attractivein New Zealand , I think . I stayed there when I was buying potatoes at Timaru . I especially liked the square . Say ! Why do n't you three have lunch with me ? " He led them to a special J.P.B. section , where the food was better and where ration books were not needed . " Call me Bill , " he said . Delia came directly to the point . " I was hoping to show my sister the officers ' club . " " Why not ? " the J.P.B. man assured them . " In fact , I 've been working too hard lately and I was planning to take the afternoon off . How 'd you like to tour the city with me ? " Out on the street the J.P.B. man whistled and an enlisted Marine drove up with a polished Buick . Bill said the man could have the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's surprise , he held the car door open until she got in . This had never happened to her before . Ill at ease in a car with left-hand drive , she started on her tour of the city . Once she looked into the mirror and saw Delia , with tears in her eyes , staring at the American who rode beside her . They were pathetically in love and she looked straight ahead . " Our work is pretty grueling , " the J.P.B. man said . " Contact with the public all day long . True , we get three pounds a day to live on ... " " You mean one man gets three pounds a day ? " Anne gasped . " Yes . But we have to buy many things out of that . And then the gooks try to . . . " He stopped abruptly . " I 'm sorry , Miss Neville.  |p285I  apologize for using that word . You see , I work with the dockhandssometimes . . . " At tea time he pulled the Buick up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed so much money . There were slot machines , all kinds of drinks and expensive gifts for girls . " ' This is for you ! " Bill said , giving Anne a carton of American cigarettes . When she refused them he said , " We get them for practicallynothing . A deal we have on . " After tea he turned on the juke box and carefully held her chair while she rose . She could never remember having seen a New Zealanderdo that for a girl , and when they got back to the Prince George a bellboy arrived with a bouquet of roses , the first flowers she had ever received . The card read , " Roses for a lady who does n't need them . Bill . " At dinner , Anne , somewhat breathless , noticed the J.P.B. men carefully . They were polished men , not like the boors she had met in the store at Christchurch . They wore spotless uniforms , highly polished shoes and clean smiles . She particularly noticed that they did n't speak in loud voices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buick , two Maoris became confused . One stopped to let Bill pass , but the other kept moving and had no choice but to bump ever so slightly into Delia . Instinctively , like an infuriated animal , Bill shot out his right fist and knocked the offending Maori down . " Do n't knock into white girls , you damned nigger ! " he cried . When she got back to Christchurch Anne could not explain exactly what had happened next . " All I recall is that suddenly thirty or forty New Zealanders . . . Barbara , I was never so proud of New Zealanders in my life . One of them shouted , You 'll not call our Maoris niggers ! ' There was a terrible fight . " " What happened ? " " I think my J.P.B. man would have got away . But I tripped him ! " " Cheers ! Then what ? " " Then you 'd have been surprised . Oh , Barbara . " She bit her lip and started twice to explain . Finally she sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so terribly , horribly sorry for Deel . " " For Delia ? " " Yes . Poor little Deel . Because in the morning her Marine sailed.  |p286They  had known he was going but they they did n't tell me . He had taken a big risk to get away from camp . It was to have been a perfectdance , one last night . " " What did he do ? " " What could he do ? He jumped into the fight and helped the other American . " " What happened ? " " The military police arrested him . He was taken back to camp for discipline . Deel never saw him again . " Barbara sighed and poured her sister a fresh cup of tea . " I thought you were going up to Wellington to give little Deel the devil . " " I do n't know what 's happening any more , Barbara . Deel and her American were pathetically happy together . And I wrecked their last night . That 's all I know . " She also knew that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Maoris , and when she finished reporting to Barbara she sat down and wrote a bitter letter denouncing such behaviorand sent it to the Christchurch paper . She said she hoped that for the good name of her country , every New Zealander would publicly rebuff any Americans who tried to introduce race discrimination . Her letter had a surprising result . Early next morning an olive-drab staff car stopped before the cottage and a young Marine lieutenant inquired for Miss Anne Neville . He doffed his cap , bowed and said , " I 've come from Headquarters . . . to apologize on behalf of the Marine Corps . " " What for ? " Anne asked . " Come in . " " Your letter . In the paper . The General was outraged . See . " He handed Anne a mimeographed notice which began , " Yesterday a New Zealand citizen complained , with reason , of American behavioron a delicate and important subject . " The young man said , " It 's been distributed to all units , Miss Neville . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed her : " If any further instances occur of disrespect to Maoris , severe disciplinary action will follow . " He coughed nervously and said , " Actually , America appreciates deeply the courtesies your country has extended us . We know ourp287intrusion is bound to cause minor frictions . We regret that , indeed we do . " " Thank you , " Anne said . " Thank you very much . " " The General wanted to know if you wished to make a specific complaint . " " No . I 've forgotten it . " " I 'm glad , because if you named names the General would just about massacre them . " " I do n't want that . I wrote in anger , but it 's all over now . " " I 'm really glad , because I can appreciate your resent Incur better than some . I was educated in England . New Zealand is very much like England . " " You were ? " Anne cried . " Oh , Barbara ! The lieutenant says he was educated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat with her sister . " Anne and I were educated there , too , " she said . " Father always said a naval officer did n't make enough to live on , but he 'd see we went Home for schooling . " " I knew some splendid New Zealanders at Oxford , " the American said . " Were you a Rhodes Scholar ? " Anne asked . " Yes . I live in Oklahoma and the competition was n't too keen there . " " You went to Oxford ! " Anne repeated . " Barbara , let 's have some tea ! " " Oh ! " Barbara cried . " Look at the clock ! " " Have I been keeping you ? " the lieutenant asked . " Gracious ! I 'm late ! " " Could I drive you ... " The next two months were like an aching , lovely dream . During every free hour Anne Neville and Richard Bates were together . He spoke endlessly of his days at Oxford and she queried him about out-of-the-way towns she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " My memories of Home are very persistent , but I have never felt that my life would be as meaningful in England as it is here . " He laughed and said , " It 's the same with me . I prized Oxford but it was Oklahoma I really loved . " His effect on the cottage at Ferrymead was electric . He took mastp288of his meals there , and the three girls were delighted to have a man to care for , and a very decent man at that . Evelyn brought him the paper . Barbara fed him too much food , and Anne ransacked the cellar for odd books he might like to see . In the evenings they often sat together , the four of them , with Mrs. Neville in her own mysteriouscorner , talking and having a rare time . Frequently he took Anne to some military dance or other and late one night Evelyn jumped into bed with Barbara and poked her in the ribs . " Babs ! " the youngster cried . " You 'd never believe it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Iceberg Annie ! She 's out front necking her head off . " " Of course I believe it ! " Barbara said sharply . " Now get to bed . " " I think it 's wonderful ! " Evelyn said . " Our Annie and an Ameri-can ! " " Get out of here ! " But when the child had left , Barbara crept to the window . Below , in the staff car , she could see Anne in an eveningdress , kissing and talking and talking and kissing . Barbara thought it was very appropriate , very warm and appropriate . During the next few days Evelyn turned the conversation constantly to love . What did Lieutenant Bates think of all the marriages that were taking place in New Zealand ? Did Lieutenant Bates see the story about the Wellington girl who had taken one look at her husband 's home in California and hurried right back to New Zealand ? Finally the American pushed his chair back from the tea table and said , " I was going to ask Barbara if it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be the most concerned . Have I your permission ? " " You bet ! " Evelyn cried . Barbara , acting as mother , asked when Richard thought the marriageshould take place . He said he 'd have to get special permission from Admiral Halsey , but that such permission was being granted to Marines who might be sailing north . The next days had an autumnal beauty about them . Bates spent most of his time at the cottage , and the three sisters accepted him as a member of the family , as if he were already married . Once he asked Barbara if she would like him to bring along a Marine who might like to meet her . She said no , explaining that she did not yet feel like a woman again . " I 'm sort of an ageless mother . Or a newp289bride . I keep thinking that my husband is going to return at any moment . " She added , " It 's very curious what war does . " " I know , " Bates said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of calling everyone here a gook . I could never have done that in peace time . " " When are you going to marry the gook ? " Evelyn asked . " Halsey has n't acted upon my request , " the Marine replied , " but it ought to be soon . " But before the wedding could take place the FirstMarDiv shipped out . They left , Anne thought , willingly and yet with a premonition of catastrophe . They were in the bars and movies on Wednesday . But by Thursday morning the ships had quietly sailed . Then followed days of silent waiting , breathless expectation before the radio , during which Anne was several times inspired to talk frankly with Barbara , telling her of scorching fears ; but there had always been something about the Neville family that forbade the sharing of secrets , and now Anne wondered if that was not the reason for her mother 's sitting dumbly in the rocking chair . Once she came perilously close to honest talk when she said to Barbara , " There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather glad I 'm going to marry on easygoing American . " But when the name of the island to which Bates had gone was announced , Tarawa , she had an instant intuition that she would never marry him . When the first enormous casualties were announced  --  totalsonly , not names  --  a ghastly pall settled over many New Zealand families and more than a hundred excellent young women like Anne Neville , whose marriages had been delayed by the red tape of war , broke down wherever they were and went sobbing to their sisters or fathers or mothers . Anne said dully , " I 'm going to have a baby . " Barbara continued washing dishes and said , " I think Dick 'll come through all right . " Anne said , " We both knew the ships were sailing soon . Some other island . " Barbara stopped her work and said , " Darling ! You do n't have to justify yourself to me . " Anne said , " I had a strange thought . I was glad that Mother would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  |p290Barbara  laughed . " You underestimate Mother . She knew what war was . One after another . " Anne said , " What should we do if Dick does n't get back ? " Barbara said , " He will . It would be unfair if this family lost anyone else . " As in a hundred similar homes , Anne said , " I 'll have the baby . Right here if you 'll let me . " Barbara laughed again . " Let you ! Whose home do you think it is ? " Anne laughed and said , " You do all the dishes . " Then followed a curious barbarism of war . In anxious America the names of the dead Marines on Tarawa were rushed onto the front pages of village newspapers . There the pictures of dead heroes were displayed in a kind of public agony ; and many small towns that had predicted nothing but disaster for some young no-good now proudly published his picture and nobody in the entire town gave a damn , except that it made their village important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marines were intimately a part of the population , the notice of death did not arrive , for it was unprecedentedto hold that any soldier could have owed allegiance to two different nations . So Anne Neville lived a desperate fear , afraid to call the American headquarters , for she was not married to her Marine . She received an ugly fright one morning when an American staff car pulled up at the cottage . A major in his middle thirties , pompous and plump , knocked at the door and announced himself as Major Harding . " Is Miss Anne Neville at home ? " Anne , in whom pregnancy had started in earnest , felt faint and was unable to speak , but Barbara , standing beside her , said , " This is my sister . She 's Anne Neville . " With extraordinary politeness the major found two chairs . Then , sitting very straight on a third , he said , " You must take this interviewvery seriously . A great deal depends upon this interview . " " Please ! " Barbara said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara the major stared at Anne and asked , " Your age ? " " She 's thirty , " Barbara said . " Please ! " the major said stiffly . " Would Miss Anne Neville please reply ? Born ? " " Ferrymead , " Barbara responded.  |p291The  major carefully placed his pen in his notebook and said , ' ' The record must be precise . And in your sister 's own words . Otherwise we shall be able to do nothing for her . Your father living ? " " No , " Anne said cautiously . " His occupation when living ? " " A captain ! " Barbara exploded . " A captain in the Royal Navy ! " The major wrote rapidly . " That is important ! That 's going to help a great deal . Your religion ? " " Church of England , " Anne said . " I guess that 's what we call Episcopalian , " the major said . " I 'm Baptist , myself . You girls lived here for some time ? " " Thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No ! " " Look , Miss Neville . I do n't like this any more than you do . Besides , I 'm asking your sister . ' Would your minister be willing to swear that you were of good Christian reputation ? " " Yes , " Anne said quietly . The major sighed and smiled at the sisters . " That 's that . Dreadful questions , but I 'm going to break a confidence and say right out that you 're as good as married . " " What do you mean ? " Anne asked . " Miss Neville ! " the major said , rising and extending his hand , " in ten minutes I 'm going to cable Noumea and recommend , without qualification , your marriage to Lieutenant Bates . And in the meantimethe American Government wants to give you this present . " Anne unfolded the parcel and read the book 's title : W.P.A. Guide to Oklahoma . " What 's this ? " she asked . " If you 're going to live in Oklahoma , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be prepared when you get there . And tomorrow night you 're invited to the Young Eagles Club . " " The what ? " Barbara asked . But the major was already in his good-bye spiel . " I think America is very lucky , getting a fine good-looking girl like you . Yes , sir , rules or no rules , I 'm telling you now , you 're practically an American , Miss Neville ! " " Then maybe you could help us ? " Barbara asked hesitatingly . " At your service ! Once you pass the investigation we 'll do anythingwithin reason . We want you to like America . "  | " Anne 's future husband ... Lieutenant Bates ... he 's on Tarawa . " The pompousness and the major-ness evaporated and Harding banged his leg . " Oh , damn it ! " he groaned . " Why wo n't they let us have those lists ? " " Is there any way you could find out ? " " No ! " he snapped . " You 'd think we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us have the lists . " " Is there anything we might do ? " Barbara asked . " Not a damn thing , " the major sighed . Then suddenly he jammed his hat on his head and asked , " Is that the phone , there on the corner ? " " Yes , " Barbara said , leading him to the bright-red kiosk . Major Harding pushed his way in , jangled the hook and stuck his head out the door . " How do you work these damned gook phones ? " he asked . Barbara laughed and said , " They 're difficult . " Then she showed him how to deposit the pennies , and listened as he stormed at headquartersabout the casualty lists from Tarawa . " Damn it ! " she heard him shout , " these are fine girls . The one I interviewed this morning is as fine as any American girl you 'd ever meet . She 's got a right to know . " He slammed the receiver and said , " I 'm disgusted . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what red tape was . " " If you hear , please let us know . " " Let you know ! Sister , I 'm going to cable Halsey direct ! " Before he said good-bye to Anne he whispered to Barbara , " This damned routine is getting me down . Checking on marriages when you are n't sure there 's ever going to be one . " " Have you met this situation before ? " Barbara asked . He looked down at her with the worn-out patience of a businessmantrying to explain to his wife what had happened at the office . " Have I met it ? Lady , the last four marriages I 've investigated , we do n't know whether the husband got through Tarawa or not . " He shook Anne 's hand and then Barbara 's . " You girls were swell . This is a hell of a job they gave me , is n't it ? " He climbed back into the staff car and started forth to interview another Christchurch girl who wanted to marry an American who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rear door Anne said , " Life with people like that might be fun . " Barbara laughed and said , " I thought I 'd scream if he called mep293Lady one more time . Say ! " she said , leafing through the book on Oklahoma . " I thought where you 're going was a city . Look at all this land ! " The next evening Major Harding appeared after tea and said , " The Young Eagles Club is meeting in Christchurch tonight , and with your permission I 'd like to take you in . " " There 's no news about Dick ? " " None . This Young Eagles Club sounds funny , but it 's a good idea . Wish you 'd come along . " " What is it ? " Anne asked . " American Government is very eager that you girls marrying Americans understand your new country . The consul is going to speak tonight about conditions in the western part of the country . " " I 'd rather not , Major . " " I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sec , there 's a lot of fables abroad about our country . We like to keep the record clear . " " Your men brag enough about it , " Barbara interjected . The major turned and spoke directly to her . " You misunderstand ! The Eagles Clubs  --  there 's one in every city  --  try to correct misinformation . After all , " he laughed , " America is n't like you see in the movies . At the Eagles Club we try to tell the truth . " " I 'd like to hear such a meeting ! " Barbara said . Stuffily the major explained , " But you 're not eligible . It 's only for girls who are going to marry Americans . " He led Anne to the staff car and carefully held the door for her . Evelyn said , " If all Americans do that for girls , no wonder they 're such dynamite ! " Barbara asked her sister to sit down . " You 've got to watch your language , Evelyn . " " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean swearing so much as your slovenly way of speaking . Your use of so many American words . " " I sort of go for it ! " Evelyn replied . " But where do you learn such words ? " " I hear the Americans talking . Stores . Places . " " Evelyn ! Have you been meeting . . . soldiers , I mean ? " The younger girl thought for a moment and said , " Well , not meeting , exactly . But I see a certain Yank after school . " " Oh , darling ! You 're only fifteen ! "  | " Lots of girls walk with American soldiers . They 're very nice . " " Look , darling ! You 've been awfully sweet with me , being patient when I acted like a mother . For two more years , Evelyn , believe in what I tell you . Do n't go with soldiers . " " But Iceberg Annie went with one and everything turned out swell . " " Not so swell , maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because Anne is going to have a baby . " Evelyn drew back and stared across the table . She started to speak and then rose slowly and started to help with the dishes . " I 'll do what you say , Mums ! " she laughed nervously . Then she asked , " Will Anne have the baby ? " " Of course ! " " Because I think Dick Bates is alive . " " Of course he is ! " When Anne returned , Evelyn fetched her a chair and the three girls sat about the kitchen table discussing the Young Eagles Club . " It was really amazing ! " Anne said . " There must have been two hundred of us , all planning to go to America . The consul explained how much different America was from the movies . Then the head chaplain from Wellington assured us that America was n't like the movies . And finally the colonel said Americans did n't all have the luxuries you see in the movies . " " Sounds like they only had one record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Barbara asked . " Strangely , no . Because each man so obviously wanted us to like his country . And there was one exciting bit when a big map of the States was brought in . The two Callender girls are marrying Yanks , you know . The consul asked them to stand up . The older girl  --  she 's the one with buck teeth  --  is going to live in California . The one who 's marrying a Catholic boy will live in Boston . The consul asked each girl to stand up front with her finger in her city . Then he said the average American family would be able to visit back and forth between two cities that far apart perhaps once in four years . He said it would cost  --  oh , something like three hundred pounds . Then he laughed and said , So you sisters better give up any idea of nagging your husbands for a visit every summer . Unless your husbandsare rich , like in the movies . ' " " Then he laughed , ha ha ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression everyone was trying to tell the truth . " " That 's easy ! " Evelyn explained . " They know the G.I. 's have lied to lots of our girls and they 're afraid the New Zealanders will tell the truth first . " For the first time in several days Anne laughed . " I think you 're right ! Because one of the girls asked a special question . She said she was marrying a Negro from Georgia and what would it he like in America ? Like marrying a Maori ? " " How did they answer that one ? " Evelyn asked . " The consul coughed , but the head chaplain spoke right up . If I were you , my dear , I would n't go through with such a marriage . ' " Why not ? ' the girl asked . " Because your life will be an intolerable misery , ' the chaplain said . " " It must have been exciting , " Barbara said . " It was , in special ways . I sat beside two girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another praying . " Early next morning the staff car stopped at Ferrymead . The major seemed afraid to get out and Evelyn , watching at the window , whispered to Barbara , " Oh , my God ! " There was a knock at the door and Major Harding said bluntly , " We got the list . Lieutenant Bates was killed . At Tarawa . " It was Barbara who started to cry . Anne simply sat down and stared at the major , who said , " We demanded the lists and we got them . A great many men were killed . " " Thank you , Major , " Barbara sniffed . She indicated that he was to leave . " No , " he said stubbornly . " I ca n't leave like this . People should not be alone at a time like this . " " Please , " Barbara begged . " No , Mrs. Forbes , there 's a great deal I can do for you . After all , your sister is practically an American now . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers back this afternoon , " Barbara said . When he had left , the three girls  --  almost as if by signal  --  started to care for their mother . With unusual attention they bathed and fed her , talked with her about the weather , and placed her chairp296so she could study the estuary . At the end Anne said , " I 'm going to lie down . " Evelyn said , " I 'll be off to school , and , Babs , I wo n't walk with the Americans . " Anne stopped . " What 's this about Americans ? " " Oh , I just met a nice Yank at the store . We 've been walking together . " . " You seem very young , " Anne said in a whisper . " Barbara thought so , too , " Evelyn laughed . " Let 's agree on one thing , " Anne said , taking Evelyn 's two hands . " Let 's agree that if later on you do want to talk with a soldier , you 'll bring him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Evelyn agreed . But when she was gone Barbara said , " Anne ! You 've ruined it ! She agreed not to see any Americans till she was seventeen . " " How silly ! " Anne laughed with nervous uncertainty . " Evelyn 's almost a grown girl . Sooner or later , if the occupation keeps up . . . " " I 'll call the store and tell them you 'll not be in . That you wo n't be in any more , " Barbara said , escaping from a thought which had begun to agitate her mind . " Nonsense , Barbara ! I 'll work like anyone else . " " No . You 'll stay here and watch Evelyn and Mother . I 'll take your job . Now lie down . " As Anne did so she looked up and said , " I do wish that Delia were here . I never understood Delia . " Then she hugged the pillow to her face and made believe she had fallen asleep . Barbara tiptoed out of the cottage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne 's employer . The man growled , " She ca n't just quit . She 's got to clear it with Manpower . " " I 'm taking her place , " Barbara explained . " You 'll have to clear it with Manpower , " the voice warned . When Evelyn reached home that night she said , " See ! I came straight home . " There was a touch of bitterness in her make-believe childishness and Barbara said quickly , " It 's exactly as Anne proposed , dear . If you want to talk with an American soldier , you bring him here . In your own home . " " I thought you said two years ? " " Anne 's proposal was wiser . You see , darling , you 're not grown up yet and you 're not a child . "  | " It 's just that there are n't any boys I know . . . They 've all gone to war . " Barbara was shocked . She had thought of Evelyn always as a child , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing into adulthood as to anyone else . Then suddenly little Evelyn threw her arms across the table and began to sob violently . " What 's happened ? " Barbara cried . " Nothing . just that Daddy 's gone and Kit and your Mark and now Dick . Everyone I 've loved has been killed . " She kepi her face against the table , but her shoulders twisted in a manner that tore at Barbara 's heart . " You 've got to believe that it all adds to some purpose , " the older girl said . " Do n't be so goddamned brave ! " Evelyn sniffed . " Even Deel 's gone ! And I feel like the devil , Babs . " " I know , " her sister argued . " I 've been so concerned about myself I 've forgotten you were growing . . . " Evelyn wiped her eyes and asked , " Where 's Anne ? " " The major and a chaplain came to take her to another meeting of the Young Eagles . They said she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretty soon she 'll be packing a gat , " Evelyn said . The two sisters thought this very funny but Evelyn stopped laughing abruptly and asked , " Gabs ! Could I bring Max home ? You would n't be . . . ashamed of me ? " " No , darling ! Of course not ! " Quickly the younger girl ran to the kitchen door and cried , " Y000 , Max ! It 's all right ! " From the darkness appeared a small wiry G.I. with a uniform that did n't fit too well and sharp , penetrating eyes . " This is Max Murphy ! " Evelyn said proudly . Max said he was from New York City , " Biggest burg in the world . " He fell comfortably into Captain Neville 's old chair and propped his feet on the ottoman . " Would you care for some tea , Max ? " Barbara asked . " Boy ! " he said , picking his teeth . " This is some country . Nothin but tea . " " Do n't you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who desperately wants to like her only daughter 's first beau.  | " Me ? I despise tea . If you ask me too much tea is why the teeth of New Zealand is so rotten . " Barbara gulped . This was a very touchy subject . She herself had excellent teeth , but she had to acknowledge that her countrymen did not . In fact the dental health of New Zealand was shocking , but she thought it ungenerous of Max Murphy to say so . " Tell me , what do you New Zealanders think ? " Max asked . " About what ? " Barbara inquired . " About us Americans coming in and saving your country ? Where was your men ? " Barbara was about to explain , bitterly , where her men were , but she happened to look at Evelyn and the girl was so delighted to have Max there in the comfortable chair , handing out his opinions , that Barbara could say nothing . There was not time enough in the world , she realized , to explain to such Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do was to be patient and hope that they would learn . " It 's a tough war ! " Max continued , wolfing the sugar cookies  --  there was so little sugar in New Zealand that it was always kept for American G.I. 's  --  and trying to blow smoke rings . " You probably would n't believe it , but I been away from home for more than a year ! " When Max left , Barbara asked Evelyn , " Which battles was he in ? " " Oh , he 's never been in any . He 's been stationed in Hawaii . Do n't you think he 's cute ? " " Yes , " Barbara said . That night she prayed that the Americans would invade some new island  --  in a hurry . Reluctantly , however , she had to turn over to Anne the supervision of Evelyn 's dates with Max , for when she reported to Manpowershe was told bluntly and irrevocably that she could not work at Anne 's old job . She must serve as nurse in the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a nurse ! " Barbara protested . " Neither have the others , " the commissioners said . " I 'll appeal . " " The appeal is not granted . " " You handle the appeals , too ? " " We must . This is a total emergency . " " I know , " Barbara said.  |p299The  manpower shortage was so acute that she had to start work the next morning . Her work was so horrifying that she preferred never to speak of it . The hospital matron said , " It 's our only choice , Mrs. Forbes . You 've been married . We ca n't give such work to naive girls . " The bed pans did not bother Barbara , not even when the idiot inmates spilled them along the corridors , but the old amen who had lost their minds completely were such cruel relics of the handsome New Zealand men she had known that sometimes she felt as if she could not work another day . And at night when she got home , there would be Max Murphy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Anne 's baby was born , Max went into the bedroom to see the ugly little girl and returned to his chair soberly shaking his head . In a whispered voice he pointed out that in America nice girls did n't have babies without being married . He said his mother would break his sister 's back if she went around having babies . And furthermorehis older brother would crucify the man responsible ; that is , after his brother got out of reform school he would crucify the guy . Max also reported that he had seen the last brides ' ship leave for the States , and in his opinion most of the girls on board were pigs . Barbara blushed at this , but Max quickly added , " There were also some nice girls like you and Evelyn , but not many . Most of them was pigs . " Barbara would have been unable to stand both Max and the hospital , had not Major Harding begun stopping at the cottage . He came at first to report that Lieutenant Richard Bates had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply to the committeeon illegitimate children she could get a government allowance . " We do n't need that , " Barbara said . The major stayed that night and talked with the girls for a long time . Later , his presence slowed Max down a bit and Barbara once went so far as to inquire if there was any way that Max could be eased out of Christchurch . " I 'll look into it , " the major said . But pleasant as it was to have the stiff and somewhat unsure American officer there  --  he brought immense stores of presents from the PX  --  it was also trying at times . He often spoke of his Chicagop300experiences but inevitably wound up with his impressions of New Zealand . " At first I could n't see this country . What in hell , ' I asked myself , are thesd people doing in Europe when they ca n't even protecttheir own country from the Japs ? ' " " How did you answer yourself ? " Barbara asked , leaning wearily on her elbows . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Empire , and although it seems pretty stupid , I have to respect you . This country has guts . " At other times the major would dandle the baby on his knee and coo , " You 're an American kid , you are . You 're as good as any American baby born this year . " Anne laughed at this when the major was gone and said she was sure he thought exactly like a Nazi : " This Polish baby had a Germanfather , so it 's sacred to the Fuehrer ! " " I 'm too tired to be amused by the supermen , " Barbara replied , but she was pleased when Major Harding insisted that she go to the movies with him . At the door , as Anne and Evelyn were admiringher before she left to join the major in the staff car , she suddenlyheld out her ugly red hands . The nails were broken from scrubbing floors , the cuticle had disappeared in lye and harsh soaps . " I 'd almost forgotten I was a woman , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and brought her a pair of gloves , but in the cinema Major Harding slowly pulled the gloves off and took her hands . His fingers felt the roughness and there was a moment of agonizing suspense , after which he drew the hand to his lips in the darkness and whispered , " You New Zealand girls fight right with your men . " But the cinema was a dreadful bust , because it showed Errol Flynn winning the war in Burma and murmurs of protest rose to sharp cries of derision . Many New Zealanders walked out , and next evening Major Harding waited on the doorstep , poking his head around the corner of the door , asking , " Can an American come in ? " He had the papers , which were filled with angry complaint against the stupidity of the American film . " So help me , " he said . " I never knew there were any British troops in Burma . " " We do n't want praise , " Barbara explained wearily . " Really wep301do n't . But we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's humiliatingto see Errol Flynn . . . " " Thank heavens he was n't an American born ! " Major I larding said . Then , awkwardly , he took a parcel from his pocket and handed it to Barbara . Eagerly she opened it and took out two bottles of an American hand lotion . At first she was outraged , and then her curiosity triumphed and she poured a little on her palm . " I was outside the door last night when you were showing your hands , " he said . " It 's very hard for a stranger to understand a new country . " Barbara laughed and said she hated girls who accepted presents . from the American PX but there just was n't ... She would have cried , but instead she ran into the bedroom and placed the bottles on her dresser . Then she said to the major that she forgave the Americans their PX 's and even their films . There was one American , however , whom she could never forgive . Night after night brash young Max Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delivering his opinions of New Zealand . " Until I rode on a New Zealand train I did n't know what murder was . When the train stops everybody piles out for tea and sandwiches  --  he pronounced it sandwiches  --  and if you get caught in the middle you 're a dead duck . " " We happen to like tea , " Barbara explained wearily . " But why do n't you have diners on your trains ? In America we do . " " Custom , Max . You have diners . We do n't . " " But it 's not diners I 'm worried about , " he said sagaciously , gormandizingthe sugar cookies that Evelyn dutifully brought him . " It 's the disrespect New Zealand men show their women . " " Oh , dear ! " Barbara sighed inwardly . " Here we go again ! The puritanical American ! " " What I mean is , " Max explained , " like when the train stops . Men knock women over to get their tea first . Now in America ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother , but even in the darkened room she could hear Max belaboring the point that in America men respected women . Barbara had noticed this strange obsession before , the frontier-like worship of women coupledwith totally confused attitudes toward sex : women were to bep302idolized , but they must jump into bed if a man whistled , and if they did they were pigs . Barbara tucked in her mother 's blankets and laughed nervously . " I 'm glad I 'm not an American girl . Imagine trying to please Max Murphy . " When she entered the kitchen , Max was saying , " Thing that gets me is the immorality of New Zealand women . They have babies . . . " He looked up and saw Barbara 's unmasked glare . Quickly he changed the subject and said , " You hear the story about the New Zealand waitress who was bragging about her new boy friend ? He comes to me table and orders tea , which I serves very hot . Do you think he pours it in his saucer to blow on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not him ! He leaves it in the cup and fans it real polite , wiv ' his hat . ' " Max doubled up with laughter and Evelyn , delighted to have him with her in the kitchen , cried , " Max ! Where do you get all your stories ? " That was enough for Barbara . " You should n't use that word , Max . " " What word ? Bloody ? " He roared with laughter and said , " In America there 's nothing wrong with bloody . " " In New Zealand there is . " " That 's what 's wrong with New Zealand . . . " " I think it would be better if you did n't come here any more , Max . " Evelyn jumped up and cried , " Oh , Barbara ! " " No need to get sore , " Max said pettishly . " Just because I said bloody . " " It 's not that , " Barbara explained patiently . " It 's just that .. . Well , Evelyn has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hit by a ton of bricks , " Max said in bravado . " I get a hint . I know when I 'm not wanted . " " That 's right , " Barbara said firmly . She scooped up the rest of the cookies and stuffed them in a bag . " You take these , Max . You 've been very sweet to Evelyn . Let us know . . . " She stopped short . She had been about to say , " Let us know if you ever get into any real fighting , " but she knew that in wartime one never goads that wound , not even in fun . " Let us know when you get safely home . " " Ca n't be soon enough for me , " Max said sheepishly . Then he shook Evelyn 's hand and said , " You 're a very good kid . For a New Zealander . "  |p303When  he was gone Evelyn burst into tears and cried , " That was dirty rotten ! I 'm going to see him whenever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling ! " Barbara assured her . " Then why did you send him away ? " Barbara finished washing up the tea things and then sat with her sister . " Surely you and I know that Max was a dreadful person . You know he 's dull . Foolish . A braggart . " Evelyn looked down at the floor for a moment and then admitted softly , " I know all that , Babs . But he 's the only boy I 've ever met . They 're all away . " Nothing Evelyn might have said could have moved Barbara so deeply . She wanted to console her sister , for Evelyn had spoken this day 's truth . Max Murphy was the best boy available . In the happy years when a girl should be knocking about with boys , listening to their boasts , surveying their natures , there had been none in the land ; and now though she was old enough to fall in love , even the first-rate Americans had moved north to the terrible islands . Barbara said quietly , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to see you walking with a very nice boy ? Tommy somebody ? " Evelyn looked up quickly . " Did you think Tommy was nice ? " " Yes , I did rather . " " Oh , I did , too ! " " Where is Tommy ? " " He 's in Italy . " There was an awkward pause and Evelyn started to cry . " Tell you what ! " Barbara said . " The minute Tommy gets home we 'll have him over here . Imagine ! He 'll be able to tell us all about Africa and Italy . " Evelyn wiped her eyes and confessed , " I kissed Max . Several times . " " Was it fun ? " " Yes . . . But I have to admit , he was a terrible drip . " " I thought so . " " He used to tell me every day , If we hadn'ta moved in , this country woulda been sitting ducks for the Japs . Where were your men ? ' Where in hell did he think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara laughed . " Oh ho ! " Evelyn chuckled . " Look who 's telling me about Americans ! Look who was kissing one half to death last night ! "  |p304Barbara  blushed and said , " Major Harding is different . " " I 'll say he is . Tell me the truth ! Are you going to marry him ? " " We 've not discussed it . Probably not . " " Why ? " " I should n't like to live in America . " Evelyn changed the subject . " If you knew all along that Max was a drip , why did n't you say so ? " " Because girls have got to discover some things for themselves . " And next morning the Neville sisters discovered how long their emotions had been imprisoned . For Major Holland appeared at Ferrymead with the news that Max Murphy had insisted upon transfer north . " I guess he had a fight with Evelyn because he told me confidentially that all New Zealand girls were pigs . " " We appreciate your telling us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came out for ! Listen ! " They stood quietly in the kitchen and caught the sound of whistlesblowing in the distance . Then car horns began to whine and Barbara saw women dashing out into the street . " It 's over ! " Major Harding said . " What ? " Anne asked desperately , afraid to form the words . " The war ! The war in Europe ! " Barbara sat down and put her hands over her face . England , their Home , had been saved . The crusade that had seemed so quixotic had ended as her father and husband had said it must end . This was radiant news , and in a moment she joined her sisters in their hectic celebration . Twice Major Harding tried to remind the girls that the war in the Pacific was still critical , but Barbara and Anne would not considerthis . That was America 's affair . Their war  --  the real war , as New Zealanders called it  --  was over ! A great national sigh accompanied by prayers , riots , broken heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Major Harding drove the girls down into the square , where a frenzy developed . After watching what seemed to him an irrational and premature celebration he excused himself . " I feel as out of place as an Englishman at a Fourth-of-July picnic . " Late that night the Neville girls went home , tired and hoarse . Their war was over . Then the first contingent of soldiers arrived from the Italian front . Their transport docked at Wellington and there was somep305talk of flying the South Island troops down to Christchurch , but there was national protest , for it was recognized that a plant disaster , after five years absence overseas , would be intolerable . So the ferry was crammed with Enzedders , and in the morning it arrivedat Littleton . The heroes of South Island marched onto a special train that hauled them under the mountain and into Christchurch , where in the distance they heard a fine skirling sound : the bagpipes of home . Slowly the train chugged to a halt , and the pipes played a lament for the missing dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tobruk , Benghazi , Crete , Cassino swung into the square . They were neither cocky nor victorious nor afraid nor tearful . They were just men who had been away at their jobs for five years . There were not even any cheers , only the click of metaled heels upon the stones and the whispers of women . The Lord Mayor looked straight ahead , and Major Harding , the American representative , saluted stiffly . Then Barbara became aware that Evelyn was crying . The younger girl whispered , " Look , Babs . That 's Tommy . How tall he 's grown . " The next days were like the radiant sun of autumn , when the harvest is in . Tommy appeared at the cottage and sat with his feet on the ottoman , eating all the sugar cookies the girls could bake . Major Harding was wonderful , drawing Tommy out about the war and admitting candidly , " You could never call me a hero , Tom . I sat right here in New Zealand , better fed than I 'd have been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that food ! " Tommy said . " What was it like in Italy ? " Evelyn asked . " A h , that was a tough one ! Even the Yanks were stopped , and they had all the equipment . " " Did you like Italy ? " Barbara asked . Tommy stuffed the last cookie into his mouth and said seriously , " I tell you , Mrs. Forbes , those Italian sheilas were disgraceful . They were so immoral you would n't believe it . " " I can believe it , " Barbara said , pouring some more tea . Evelyn proudly produced a pair of socks she had knitted , but Tommy raised his hand imperiously and announced , " I 'll never wear another knitted thing in me life ! " " I 'd like them , " Major Harding said , so Evelyn gave them to Barbarawho gave them to the major . Then Tommy made a startling proposal . " The Enzed Governmentp306is offering all returned men month passes on trains and planes . They want us to see the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I saw the bloke and he said it would be all right if Evelyn went up to Auckland with me , and we 'd be married at my uncle 's . " " Of course she can go , " Barbara said promptly . Anne asked , " Do you think it would be . . . " " When did you plan to leave ? " Barbara asked . She and Anne took what money they had and bought Evelyn all the things contained in a proper trousseau . They dressed her in a neat tweed traveling suit and had her stand in the kitchen while they admired her . " She 's exquisite , " Anne said proudly . Then Major Harding drove them to the airport , where the young couple climbed aboard the plane . As it rose into the air , Barbara felt as if part of her were flying off , and she thought how apoplectic her father would have been , in his Navy blues , if his baby Evelyn had proposed leaving on a honeymoon , the last day of which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from further contemplation of changing times , for at the airport she had picked up a Wellington paper . For some months past it had been her habit to read the tragic advertisementsthat were beginning to appear in New Zealand papers : " Hennessy , Harold . First Marine Division . Does any New Zealand girl living near Paekakariki have a portrait of my son killed on Guadalcanal ? Family has none . Mrs. K. L. Hennessy , Trafalgar Road , Shaker Heights , Ohio . " Barbara read these strange and shadowy messages with macabre fascination , as if she had written them : " Forbes , Mark . Third New Zealand Force . Does any wine seller in Cairo remember Mark Forbes ? If so communicate his wife . Please , please communicate , for she has forgotten how he smiled . " But on this day she read : " Bates , Richard Gaines . First Marine Division . Did any New Zealand family know my son killed at Tarawa ? If so please communicate with his mother , Mrs. R. D. Bates , Clifton Terrace , Oklahoma City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Anne would not see the message and upon arriving home she hurried to her room and locked the door . Then she wrote a long airmail letter : " My sister would never have told you this , Mrs. Bates , but she has a baby girl.  |p307I  ca n't describe how lovely this child is , nor how elfin-like she resemblesyour son . Lest you surmise this is a trick , let me assure you that Anne 's father was a distinguished captain in the Royal Navy . If you find back copies of newspapers you can read about him and the Nestor in their fight with the Graf Spec . I wish I could send a photograph of your son , but we have none . His memory was so alive with us that we had no need of pictures . " She tried to guess what Mrs. Bates in Oklahoma City would want to know , and the letter ran to three careful pages , ending , " Normally I would not tell you these things in a first letter , but I ta , lost my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you will want to know the truth without preliminary courtesies . " She posted the letter and then reported to the Manpower Commission . She said that with the pressures relieved she hoped she might be excused from further work at the insane hospital . The secretarystared at her icily and asked why she sought this favor . " Because I 'm very tired , and I must stay at home for a while . " To her surprise the secretary stopped scowling and said , " And you 're right ! You girls have done yeoman service . Time you let up . " He whipped out a thermometer and jammed it under her tongue . " You look sick , " he said . But her temperature was normal and he growled , " Nothing but exhaustion . Go home and sleep . " Then he scowled at her again . She stayed about the cottage , hoping to intercept any letters that might come from Oklahoma City , but she was outsmarted , for one morning a dignified gentleman in a black suit arrived and asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six hundred pounds . " It 's from the bank , " he said solemnly . " We received this cable . " He bowed and Anne read aloud : BELOVED DAUGHTER . COMEHOME AT ONCE . BRING CHILD . FUNDS WITH THIS CABLE . MOTHER . When the frocked messenger had gone , Anne broke into tears and cried , " Forgive me , Babs , for not telling you . " " Not telling me what ? " " About my letter to Mrs. Bates . " " What letter ? " " I hate secrets , but shortly after Evelyn left a girl at the store brought me an advertisement in the Wellington papers ... I 've saved it . " She produced a worn clipping : Bates , Richard Gaines . Quietly she confessed , " I was afraid Mrs. Bates might be some horrible ... "  | Suddenly she pressed her hand to her face and cried , " The baby ! How did she know I had a baby ! " She grabbed the cable and read again BRING CHILD . " Oh ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained , Major Harding appeared . He was in high spirits and had a big basket of food . " A celebration ! " " Whatever for ? " Barbara asked . " Our new American daughter ! " he shouted , bowing low to Anne . " Oklahoma 's own ! " " How did you find out ? " Anne asked suspiciously . " Everybody in New Zealand knows ! Boy , you got pull ! " He showed her a telegram he 'd received from the ambassador . REPRESENTATIVEHALLORAN OKLAHOMA DEMANDS IMMEDIATE PASSAGE STATES ANNE NEVILLE CHRISTCHURCH AND DAUGHTER . EXPEDITE . Barbara took the telegram and studied it . It was so American . Somebody had known somebody and somebody had damned well better expedite . She liked the telegram . Sometimes things should be done that way . Expedite . Major Harding was saying , " Now Anne , there 's going to be a lot about America you wo n't like . We do n't treat our Negroes the way you do your Maoris . What I mean is ... " The girls interrupted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies ! " " This is n't a meeting of the Young Eagles Club , " Barbara teased . " And even if your country is horrid , I 'm going , " Anne announced firmly . But a letter from Mrs. Bates indicated that Oklahoma , at least , would not be horrid . She wrote : " If you two had connived to win my heart completely nothing could have succeeded better than your two letters , Anne 's so afraid , Barbara 's so confident . When I finished them I felt I knew you both . I 'm enclosing a picture of our house , because I 've heard that many New Zealand girls have been deceived by Americans . I must warn you that we are not wealthy , but you and the baby need never want . Further , if this wo n't make you ashamed of me , I think it would be best if we made believe that you and Dick were married . I do n't care a hang , but in some ways OklahomaCity is still a small town . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch has been torn down and the place does n't look quite so nice . No help . "  |p309When  Anne 's departure was imminent Major Harding presented her with a toy pistol . " You pack it this way , Babe , " he explained . I le also taught her to snarl out of the corner of her mouth and said that when she met Mrs. Bates she was to drop her bags , extend her arms and shout in a loud clear voice , " Hiya , Toots ! " But later that night Barbara heard Anne explaining to the major that " Oklahoma City is the petroleum center of the world . All the major companies have offices there , Texaco , Standard Oil , Shell . " When Anne finally took the baby and left for America , Barbara experienced a dull heaviness of spirit . It was cruel , she thought , what had happened to her country . First the finest men had left for five years and now the finest girls were departing forever . There could be no healing the wounds New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They might even grow smooth to the exploringfinger , but the under-structure had been damaged . There could be no healing that . It was while in the grip of such melancholy reflection that Barbara called Delia in Wellington , but a man answered the phone and reported that he had the room for the week-end , because Deel was up in Auckland seeing a troop ship off . Okinawa or some place like that , he guessed . Well , wherever the Yanks were going to hit next . So Barbara composed a long letter , filled with information about Evelyn 's marriage and Anne 's departure for America . She concluded , " Now that war seems to be nearing the end they 'll surely find Cobber in one of the prison camps , and I want to tell you again , Deel , that you and Cobber are to live with us . " She added , " That will give Cobber time to find a job , " but the sentence seemed to harass old wounds , so she wrote the last page over again , omitting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered the letter in person . She appeared much thinner and yet more beautiful than ever . " I 'm so glad you invited me down , Babs . It 's hell up there , waiting for news of your man . " " I think Cobber 's all right , " Barbara assured her . " I did n't mean him . Joe 's at Okinawa . " " You must forget these Americans , Deel . " " How can I ? I 've never lived before . " " Cobber 's going to be home soon . "  | Delia brushed the hair back from her forehead and confessed , " How could I ever live with Cobber again ? I ca n't even remember him ! " Barbara sat with her sister and said , " That 's normal , in war , Deel . You know how much I loved Mark ? I can not even remember how he looked . " For more than a week the two girls worked happily about the cottage , not thinking , not worrying . They simply did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's opinion that Anne was the best off of the lot . " A home in America , a baby . And I 'll bet she 'll marry some Yank , too . " " Do you think so ? " Barbara asked . " Sure . Those Americans are hungry to marry girls like Anne . Four of them have proposed to me . " Then the rugged news from Okinawa began to appear in the papers , and the happy interlude at Ferrymead was ended . Deel wept and said , " If Joe 's killed I think I 'll die . " But he got through and on his battle leave finagled a ride all the way to Wellington , where Delia was waiting . When she left Christchurch she said , " I do n't know how this is going to end , but if Joe wants me to come to California as char lady in his restaurant , I 'll go . " The cottage at Ferrymead seemed desolate now , with only Barbara and her infantile mother . The solitude was broken in the evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shawl for Mrs. Neville . Now Barbara started to study him with special care , for it was apparent to each of them that when his duty in New Zealand ended , he would ask her to go with him to America . It was not that they were in love , she reasoned . He had found comfortin the cottage , and when people were over thirty such comfort was almost more important than love . She found John Harding to be a strange assembly of contradictions . He was less winning than Anne 's Dick Bates and much less revolting than Evelyn 's Max Murphy . He was an average American man , unsure of himself emotionally , afraide of women , yet completelyenslaved by them . Sometimes the puzzled look on his face indicated that he knew she was making fun of him , and yet she liked him immensely , for he was also an average American in that he was both generous and kind . In fact they had a fight about pres -- p311ents from the PX . On one memorable evening she had come close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had big-dealed six pairs and delivered them in a gift box . Barbara opened the package and studied the sheer beauty of stockings  --  likeall New Zealand girls she had worn none for five years , despising the black cotton ones released by the Government  --  so she was keenly eager to accept them . But a galling phrase of Max Murphy 's haunted her and she said , " Sorry , John , but I 've decided not to be a chocolate-bar beauty . " Major Harding dropped the package and said , " That 's a hell of a thing to say ! " " I mean just that ! You Yanks have been parading your PX stuff too long . Now you take these stockings . . . " He grabbed her and pulled some papers from his pockets . " PX stuff , eh ? Why , damn it , I spent six months getting these flown out here . And you 're going to take them ! " He picked up the stockings and shouted , " I got them for you because I happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockings away . " And I ca n't acceptbecause . . . well , I 'm beginning to love you . " He laughed and said he guessed he understood . He 'd seen a hundred men fall in love with New Zealand girls , but he never thought it would happen to him . " The fools come down here on leave , and they 're big heroes . Everything is gook this and gook that . Then what happens ? " The major was very fond of hearing himself talk , especially when he could act out several parts , so Barbara asked , " What happens ? " " On the last week they come running to me and cry , Major , can you wire the admiral for special permission for me to get married ? ' " " And what do you say ? " Barbara asked . " I always pour it on . I ask , You ? Married to a gook ? ' " " And they say ? " " They break down and say , Major ! I never knew what love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an embarrassed pause . Then he added with a rush , " I guess they 're getting even with me . Because I never knew what love was till I watched you and your sisters . " " What do you mean ? " Barbara asked , no longer teasing . " I guess it 's what men think about when they think of marriage . People living together and not spending too much money and hav/ing a good , quiet time . You do n't see much of that in America , any more . " Their courtship was interrupted by a cyclonic event which showed Barbara a new aspect of her major . The Japs surrendered , and although New Zealanders took the event rather casually , the Americans in the country  --  wherever more than two were gathered  --  touched off an epic celebration . Major Harding appeared with a nurse at Ferrymead and told Barbara that the nurse would take care of Mrs. Neville while they painted the town . They wound up at a cafe where three other Yanks were drinking bootleg whiskey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making heroic speeches . Major Harding 's was the best . He addressed the crowd in the cafe and said , " You won your war in Europe . Very gallant . We won ours in the Pacific . Now I want every calendar maker here and abroad to print this day in red henceforth . Why ? Not to please us . Oh , no ! America do n't need to be soft soaped , but to remind all the bastards in the world that they can push New Zealand and America just so far . " He glared menacingly about the room for a challenger , but none appeared and he ended feebly , " Print the date in red , that 's all . " " A lovely speech , " Barbara assured him . But the major felt that somehow his effort had fallen flat and he rose with a shout and cried , " I feel constrained to throw a bottle through a window , " and before anyone could stop him he had done just that . The police were called , but some New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , he 'd pay . Next day he appeared red-eyed at the cottage and asked , " Did I make a fool of myself last night ? " " No ! I like you best when you 're all Yank . " " In New York , too , they take a very dim view of bottles through windows . " " Everyone forgave you . " " I 'm glad . Because the news has come , and I would n't like to leave with people ashamed of me . " " Are you leaving ? " Barbara asked carefully . " I 'm sailing home next month . " " You must be very happy . " " I am . The admiral 's given me some leave . I 'm going down top313Queenstown to see the lake . " He blushed and added , " I was hoping you 'd come along . " Barbara evaded the fundamental question by pointing out that she could not leave her mother . " I 've thought of that , " he said . " I 've arranged for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evading . " The real reason I said I woud n't go is that I 'm the New Zealand girl who is n't falling all over herself to run off with a Yank . " The major blushed and said , " I 'm sorry . " He was about to leave when an unfortunate break trapped Barbara and forced her to reconsiderthe whole question ; for Delia arrived from Wellington with the news that Cobber Phil was being flown home from the Japanese prison in Malaya . The official list reported him as blind in one eye from beatings about the face and missing his left leg from gangrene . Delia was pale and immediately asked if Barbara would leave the cottage for a while until she 'd had a chance to talk with Cobber . " Leave us alone for a couple of days . " " What I was suggesting , " the major said . " I 've asked her to come on down to Queenstown . " In spite of her anxiety Delia could not forbear studying the American and she beamed her approval . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And I 've just said that I think Americans in uniform are disgraceful . They think any girl is dying to play around with them . " " I 'm sorry , " the major said . " As you know , that was n't my in-tention . " He left at once and Delia said reproachfully , " You sure washed that up fine . " " I meant to . " " Well , I meant it when I said I wanted to be alone with Cobber . " " What are you going to tell him ? " " Tell him ? Nothing ! I do n't owe Cobber anything . " " But you do ! He 's your husband . " " Do n't be silly . He 's no more my husband than some boy I met five years ago . " " The fact remains he 's married to you . " " That does n't erase what 's happened , Babs . You may as well know it . I 'm asking Cobber for a divorce . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because I 've found the Yanks are my kind of people . " " But Cobber 's a sick man . " " He 'll understand . " " Deel , you ca n't wash away responsibilities like that . " " My responsibilities are with Joe . I 'm going to California . " " Deel , why do you suppose I 've stayed here in the cottage year after year ? Because this was my responsibility . You 'd better find out what yours is . " " And you 'd better figure out what 's best for you , too . This major is crazy about you , Babs . You 'd better go with him now , or it 'll be too late . I 've seen girls in Wellington break their hearts . Too late . " " I do n't run off with Yanks , " Barbara protested furiously . " Well , ten thousand did , and they all have electric washers now . " " That 's horrid ! " " And true . Why mutilate yourself , Babs ? You love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds frightful , Deel . " " It 's a language I like . I 'm going to speak it the rest of my life . " " By God ! You must not do such a thing ! " The sisters argued for two days , and Delia convinced Barbara that she had no desire to be hard or to hurt Cobber or to behave immorally . She said simply , " It 's just that I 've met the kind of men I can respect . The kind I want to live with . " " But you must consider Cobber , " Barbara protested . " I 've thought it all out , " Delia assured her . " And I do wish you 'd leave the cottage , because this is going to be difficult enough , without you here siding with him . " And so , repelled by Delia 's actions , Barbara was driven to reconsiderthe invitation to Queenstown . She was not prepared to say that she wanted to marry the American , and yet she was eager to admit that knowing him had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuptial flight was merely part of the supermanattitude inculcated in all Americans by their prolonged stay among women who had been without men for years . She used one of Delia 's words : " He 's a dope , but he 's a kind and gentle dope . " To her surprise she said to Delia , " But even if I did want to go down there and tell him I 'll marry him , how would I find him ? " " At the Kentish Arms , " Delia said.  | " How do you know ? " " He told me . " " Why ? " " Because I told him you 'd change your mind . " Delia bustled her sister onto the train , and as it pulled southward Barbara became aware of how exhausted the years had made her . Too , she had forgotten the great beauty of her land , and now she lay back and feasted on the swirling valleys , the wild ocean hammeringat the coast , the towering glaciers reaching down from the sky . She felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding years had been meaningful if such a land had been preserved . From time to time she would catch the eye of some New Zealand soldier who had fought long years across the desert and in the fjords , and she would know that he was thinking the same thoughts : here was the great land , here was the realm of beauty . Then she would be jolted from her reverie by a tea stop , when a thousand berserk passengers would catapult from the train to grab massive cups of steaming tea accompanied by soggy biscuits . It was worth a woman 's life to be caught in that hungry eruption , and once as Barbara was smashed back against the wall by a huge farmer coming home from market , she recalled wryly Max Murphy 's insolentdescription of a New Zealand tea stop : " Murder , with cream and sugar . " She laughed and admitted that even Max was right sometimes . . . " The drip . " At Invercargill , cold and barren land 's end , she caught a bus which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fought against the thoughts that assailed her mind . " I am like a woman who has lost all shame and is chasing . . . " She halted that . She was not a woman without shame . She was a woman slowly falling in love with a strange man from an even stranger country . She was going to Queenstown to tell him so . That was all . " If Father could read the history of his daughters . . . " She halted that , too . Captain Neville knew war . He knew war at sea , where the greater agony comes before the ship sails . She thought , " I guess Pops would understand . " Then she sank back and watched the brooding valleys creep high toward the Alps . She would think no more . She was emotionally exhausted . She was therefore unprepared for what she encountered at thep316Kentish Arms , for when she found Major Harding he was accompanied by a red-headed girl who had obviously come along for his last leave . And the girl was wearing nylon stockings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major stood face to face . The red-head understood at once and asked apologetically , " Is this the lady you were telling me about ? " " Wait ! Barbara ! " the major cried . He overtook her at the bridge where the tame trout come to feed , but she turned on him sharply and said , " Go away . I 'll leave on the morning bus . " " She 's just a girl who 's worked at our office . She means nothing . " " Just a pal ! " Barbara cried . " She 's not even sharing the same room with me . " " But she 's wearing nylon stockings . " " You would n't take them . " The scene was revolting to Barbara , but she was caught in its rising tempo , and to her own surprise she shouted , " You brassy conquerors ! You conceited men who think every girl ... " " At least listen to what I have to say ! " " You stupid supermen ! " she cried . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she had followed for hundreds of miles one of the men she was reviling . " Oh , go away ! " she sniffed , seeking for her handkerchief . She turned and fled up the street , finding an unheated hotel with a vacant and musty room . She crawled between the shivering sheets and reflected , " Well , anyway , I 'd have made a rotten American . I have too much sense of humor . " Amused at her own behavior , and congratulating herself on her providential escape , she went to sleep . In the morning she was awakened by sharp hammering at her door and shortly became aware that she was in Queenstown and that Major Harding was outside . She commanded him to go away , but he burst into the room and announced in a frightened voice , " It 's Delia . " She drew a robe about her throat and asked from behind it , " What about her ? " " American Headquarters tracked me down . The police wanted me . " " Oh , God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband came home . From Singapore . And three hours later he killed her . " Barbara sank her face into the robe and tried to stop her cars to the next ghastly sentences : " The police want you to hurry back . He cut off her head with a saber . " Major Harding waited in the hallway until she was dressed . He kept talking to her through the opened door , assuring her that she would have been helpless to prevent the tragedy . That was precisely the wrong thing to say , for when she joined him she was reminded of the fact that if it had not been for him , she would not have come to Queenstown , and if it had not been for other Americans , Heel would not now be dead . " Get away from me ! " she muttered with unconcealed loathing , and she did not see him again until they met in court , she sitting with the Crown 's witnesses , he with the defense . The trial of Cobber Phil Friskett was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder of wives who had consorted with Americans during the occupation , and as such it aroused a bitter and pervading interest . The judge , to whom war had been a chess game played on some distant board , seemed sternly determined to hang the Cobber as a warning to other returning husbands ; but the clamor of the population was all for an acquittal . Barbara , inwardly thanking God that her parents were past knowing what was happening , was one of the first witnesses . She delivered platitudes defending her sister as a fine girl and perjuries defending her as a respectable wife . Other witnesses volunteered the information that Cobber Phil was a man of vile temper who had threatened , in prison camp , to " stab his wife a thousand times if she had played around with them Yanks . " A damning case was built up against the crippled soldier , who glowered hatefully at the jury , and it seemed the man must die when the American officer , Major John Harding , took the stand . Keeping his eyes averted from Barbara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not personally . " It was the other Americans who knew her  --  personally ? " Cobber 's lawyer asked . " Yes . " " How did you become acquainted with her ? " " I was sent to investigate . "  | " Investigate ? " " Yes . That was my job . " " But investigate what ? " " Her marriage . " " Her marriage to Friskett ? ' What interest of yours was that ? " " Not her marriage to Friskett . To a Marine . " " An American Marine ? " " Yes . An American Marine wanted to marry her . " " But she was already married . " " Yes , but she did n't tell the Marine . He applied for permission to marry . " " And you were sent to investigate ? " " Yes . " " Was that customary ? " " Always . " The defense lawyer concluded that this was the spot to make his first point , so he asked , " You investigated all New Zealand girls who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why ? " " Well ... " " Speak up . Tell us why . " " Because we did n't . . . That is , the State Department did n't want ... well , riff-raff . They did n't want riff-raff coming into the coun-try . " " Riff-raff ? I do n't believe I know that word . " " It means , well  --  undesirables . " " Oh ! Undesirables ! The State Department did n't want undesirables ... like . . . say . . . gangsters , or racketeers , or hold-up men , or counterfeiters . Of course you would n't want people like that in America . " There was immediate objection , but the counsel had made his point . Cobber Phil was no longer on trial . It was the Americans who had invaded his home . " Now , Major Harding , what kind of woman did you find Delia Friskett to be ? " " Attractive . . . Intelligent . " " I mean morally . "  | " Well , not knowing she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. , satisfactory . " " What did you think later ? " " I did n't think anything , sir . " " Quite correct . It was n't your job to think . But what did you re-port ? " " That she had been living with a lieutenant before she met the Marine who wanted to marry her . " " An American lieutenant ? " " Yes . " " And before that it was some other American ? " " Yes . " " And another , and another , and another ? " " Yes . " " Speak up , Major . I said three anothers . " " Yes . " " Now I am going to ask you , Major , how many Americans in alldid you report Delia Friskett as having been intimate with ? " Major Harding looked beseechingly at Barbara and said in a lowvoice , " Seven . " " I do apologize , Major , but you must speak up . " " Seven . " There was no sound in the courtroom as the spectators stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealander . But the Crown had its suspicions and asked , " Later on you made acquaintanceof other members of the deceased 's family . Is that cor-rect ? " " Yes . " " Where ? " " Here in Christchurch . " " Did you ever tell them of their sister 's behavior in Wellington ? " " No . " " Is is true that at one time you even contemplated marrying one of the deceased 's sisters ? " " Yes . " " Yet you never told her of your investigation of her sister . " " No . " " I suggest that you did n't because there was no such evidence . Ip320suggest that you , a military man , are lying to protect the defendant , also a military man . " Immediately the defense asked , " Major , why did you not tell the other members of the family what you have told us today in court ? " " Because the other members of the family were not like their sister . " The statement had a terrible finality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobber Phil , the first of the soldier murderers , would go free . As Barbara left the courtroom she instinctively avoided the bench where Major Harding would be , and she walked along the cool and reassuring streets of Christchurch . She was content , now , that John Harding 's testimony had proved her to be a liar . There had been too much killing , and she was glad that Cobber Phil would go free . For more than six years her life had been a hopeless turmoil of death and occupation and victory . Nov the good , clean air of peace was blowing down from the mountains , and for a moment she felt young again , as if she were a schoolgirl bright with promise , walking with pigtails and black stockings to her school . She thought , " I must have been a stupid girl . I certainly did n't learn much . " Then she had a thought that some day the people of Christchurch would understandexactly what this war was about . Someone would write a great novel , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that day she would comprehend , too , but for the present she was tired and would not try . She went into a milk bar , one of those curious innovations made popular during the American occupation , and as she ordered a lemon she mused on how strange it was that the one lasting memento of those violent men were the milkbars where you could buy sweet ice creams . She smiled at the conceit and took from her coat a letter she had skimmed once that day , but only hurriedly . It was from Oklahoma City and it ended , " The strangeness has begun to wear off . Veronica is in pre-kindergarten , would you believe it ? Mrs. Bates and I are sure that some of the women in town have begun to guess that I was never actually married , and you 'd be amused at the clever questions they ask trying to trap me . But once they 're satisfied that I 've been a bad girl they 're perfectly lovely to me . I 'm surprised to report that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really shep321does . A friend of hers has a son , he 's about forty and served with the Air Force at some English base . As soon as he heard my English accent he invited me to the country club , and three weeks now I 've said no , but last night Mrs. Bates said , and I 'm using her exact words , You ought to think about forming some lasting friendships . I wo n't live forever and I 'd feel more easy if Veronica had a solid home to grow up in . ' Then I think she called her friend , because a little while later I was invited to the country club again . And this time I said yes . " Barbara folded the letter carefuly and thought , " I 'll read it again when I get home . " She was tenderly amused at how American Anne was becoming , Anne , the most English of them all . And then as she stepped back onto the sidewalk and started with crushing weariness to walk out to the lonely cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and whispered , " Oh , God ! Do n't let him sneak away to Chicago without seeing me . Do n't let him , God ! "  |p322AUSTRALIA  is the only nation that absorbs an entire continent . Itis a vast country , about the size of the United States . It is also a violent land , often alluring , often forbidding . And it is empty , with no more inhabitants than the city of New York . At dusk , your plane rushes toward Australia , and the heavens come alive with color . The dying sun inflames the clouds . Then , in the darkness , the great empty continent looms up . In the distance , a lighthouse flashes . You can feel the loneliness that engulfs this mighty land . Then suddenly below you explode the million lights of Sydney . On half a hundred hillsides , down many bays , you see the brilliance of metropolitan Sydney , with a population of almost two million . Few approaches to the nations of the world can be so spectacular , so portentous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untold capacities ! Its deserts are more cruel than the Sahara , yet they abound in mineral wealth . Its people are courageous , yet more than two-thirds of them huddle within twenty miles of the sea , while the dead heart of their continent lies barren . Australia is a wonderful land , challenging and empty . Its unknown future inspires the imagination of all who see the lovely cities and the majestic plains . Australia 's future is uncertain because she stands , like a bewildered woman , at the schizophrenic moment . She is bedazzled by flattering choices , frightened by oppressive dilemmas . She has no clear idea of what she wants to become . Formerly an agricultural nation , Australia is now dabbling in manufactures in the dubious hope of becoming self-sufficient . There is an Australian airplane whose pilots , when they went against the Japs , wirelessed Melbourne , " We who are about to die , salute you . " There is a fine Australian car , some talk of a television set . Prices reflectthe older economy . The best filet mignon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , a good suit of clothes , made of Australian wool which has been made into cloth in England costs $85 . An electric mixer for the kitchen is $70 , and a very average refrigeratoris $457 . But a haircut is 180.  |p323Always  intensely loyal to England , Australia now acknowledges that for defense she must rely upon America . This creates a psychic wrench , which is compensated by extra attention and CoatIn sweltering Cairns , only 17 degrees off the Equator , conservative men dress as they would in London . And Sunday is like a PhiladelphiaSunday  --  cubed . Nor can Australia decide what part of the world she belongs to . Up to 1919 , she imagined herself a part of Europe , an English shire once removed . Then came the " Australasian period , " when it was believed that white Australians were destined to guide their teeming brown and yellow brothers to a civilized society . Now Australasia , as an idea is passe  --  even though a major bank is stuck with it  --  becauseAustralians realize that if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiding the white . In the bitter days of 1942 , when Japan was bombing Darwin at will , there was a brief period when Australians thought their destiny lay with Canada and the United States . Now , they 're not sure where they belong . Most important of all , Australia ca n't decide what her system of life should be . People shout for more production , but work about 35 hours a week . They insist that things be modern , but prefer the good old ways of doing things . They are intensely individualistic ( the " Australian boxing glove " is the business end of a broken bottle ) , yet they surrender many enterprises to state socialism , which runs most of them at a loss . And although they must " populate or perish , " they do n't like foreign immigrants ! But they are the most hospitable English-speaking people on earth . To get on in Australia , you must make two observations . Say , " You have the most beautiful bridge in the world " and " They tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first statement will be a lie . Sydney Bridge is big , utilitarian and the symbol of Australia , likep324the Statue of Liberty or the Eiffel Tower . But it is very ugly . No Australian will admit this . The war bride entering San Francisco was typical . The captain of the Lurline said , " Well , girls , here 's your new home . " The brides stared in silence and finally a lass from Adelaide spoke for all of them : " Sydney Bridge is better . " But Sydney Harbor is the finest I have ever seen , and that includes Acapulco . It is a thing of beauty , a fairytale body of water surrounded by little houses with red roofs . It is a superb lake set amid a nest of friendly hills . Long promontories stretch out into the bay and form anchorages which no storm can molest . Three of the land fingers are public parks , so that no matter where you are in the busy harbor , you feel close to country parks . Sydney itself is like London , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their common dependence upon the bridge . As you walk through Sydney , you feel that around the next corner you must come upon open countryside . But the city stretches for miles . Traffic is the city 's curse , because there are no adequate streets . In the shopping district , even the sidewalks are lined with yellow to keep pedestrians from crushing one another . It has been suggested that shoppers walk north on one side of the street and south on the other . As one comedian says , " Apart from the traffic , there 's only one thing wrong with Sydney  --  Melbourne ! " Where Sydney 's streets are treacherous , Melbourne 's are almost unbelievably handsome . Three chains wide  --  that 's 198 feet , three times the width of an average street  --  they are flowering wonderlands , with exotic trees down the middle . The blocks in this beautifulcity of a million and a quarter people are very long , so following Bourke Street you get an alley , Little Bourke . Some years ago , one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best patronized candy shops in the world . Remarkably pretty girls tended them , with about sixpence-worth of stale goods for sale . The customers were always men , and as soon as one arrived , the candy store was closed . Now Little Lon has shops with more substantial , but not more appreciated , supplies . Melbourne claims superiority over Sydney in four respects : its football is rougher , its girls are prettier , its loyalty to England is more constant and its beer is much better . Australians must consume ten times as much beer as they do milk.  |p325Saloons  , called hotels  --  with a crust of bread for a meal and a snarl if you ask for a room  --  are open only from ten in the morning to six . And from five o'clock on , an Australian hotel is like something out of Dante . You 've finished a day 's work and drop into your favorite pub for a couple of quick ones . At the door a blast of foul air , smoke and shattering noise greets you . Around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is jammed a struggling mass of humanity . The barmaids are slinging schooners as fast as their hands will work . They work in a kind of mechanical daze and speak to no one . You stand at the edge of the crowd and start to shout for your pint . No one notices you , so you start slowly to elbow your way up to the bar . Stale beer slops over you . You see a friend and shout at him . He bangs on the bar with his glass and finally gets hold of a pint for you . As he passes it back over the heads of others , some of it spills . At quarter to six , a bouncer begins to bellow in a mournful chant , " Come on boys ! Drink up ! Drink up ! " At five to six , he cries pleadingly , " Closing , boys , closing ! " Men order frantically and those at the bar line up three or four . The bedlam increases . At six , the doors are slammed shut and a frightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please , drink up ! " The lucky ones at the bar toss off one pint after another . In a corner , Tim O'Farrell carefully pours his beer into a growler . In a nation where there is n't enough of anything ( except food ) , beer is the greatest shortage of all . Saloons save their bottled stuff for old friends , so when Tim has a mate in at night , he has to serve whatever stale booze he 's been able to sneak out of the bar . No Australian likes such a system . It is a dreadful travesty on the good fellowship of an English pub . Workingmen guzzle like animals and reel home drunk . Yet whenever late closing is put to a vote , it 's defeated  --  by the women . They say , " Sure my husband comes home drunk . But he does come home . " The other thing Australians love is sport . In number of participants , tennis is the prime game , and the Aussies are convinced they 'll retain the Davis Cup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where combers from the Pacific thunder in , the Australianfamily collects a fine coat of tan . " We 're a nation of pagan sun-worshippers , " complain ministers during the summer months.  |p326Every  beach is protected by Life Saving Clubs , and to see the handsomely outfitted young men parading like wooden soldiers as they go to drill is an exciting experience . R &; R competitions  --  rescue and resuscitation  --  are held throughout the season . " Patients " swim madly to distant buoys , where they " drown . " On the beach a team of five goes through motions as stylized as a ballet . The beltmanrescuer  --  swimslike crazy out to the buoy , while the shore crew play out a long silken rope . Now they drag back the two swimmers and resuscitate the drowned man . On show days , it 's a game . On other days , it saves thousands of lives . Australian beaches have a special problem . The surf is so rough that many dentures are knocked loose . At low tides , the guards collectthem and place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . But in recent years , bums have been slipping in , trying the chompers for size , and walking off with a set that fits . Australia has a strong baseball league , with junior teams who wear uniforms donated by Bing Crosby . It 's amusing to read that " two sides have a fixture as finalists for the major premiership . " Girls play softball . Lacrosse and basketball are popular . Older men play bowls , " but your knee has to crick before you 're old enough to make the team . " On country stations , farmhands use a pitchfork to toss a tenpoundbag representing a sheaf of wheat over a bar . Champions toss it higher than fifty feet . Billiards is a mania with many , and Walter Lindrum was a greater champion in his game  --  pot the ball , scratch off it or carom  --  than Willie Hoppe was in his . The great games are football and cricket . Australians play four kinds of football , each rougher than the other : soccer ( II men , kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle or kick ) ; rugby league ( 13 men , rougher rules ) ; and Australian rules ( 18 men , kick , run , dribble ) . This last is a cross between throwing slaves into the Coliseum and a riot in an Irish pub . Body contact is violent , hospitalization frequent . In fact , Australian sport is a man 's occupation . Papers on Monday are a report of lacerations , who kicked whom , referees ' explanations as to why the riot developed and formal protests . One Rules game in Sydney  --  it 's really a Melbourne game  --  resulted in four fractures , a riot and the public censure of two officials . Even cricket  --  that dullest of games  --  becomes murder when Aus/tralians are involved . For several years England had dominated play for the Ashes , cricket 's mythical Davis Cup , but in the 1920 's one of the world 's most remarkable sportsmen appeared in a small Australiantown . He was Don Bradman , cricket 's Babe Ruth , Ty Cobb and Joe DiMaggio rolled into one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scoring double and triple centuries . He was knighted by the King for having practically murdered English bowlers . But they , got even . In the 1930 's they developed two bowlers of super speed who heaved the ball right at Bradman 's head . When he tried to defend himself with his bat , the English captain posted half his team in the infield . And Bradman popped up . This outrageous sportsmanship was indefensible  --  was n't cricket , you know  --  but there was no rule against it . The Ashes deteriorated into a public brawl . At Adelaide , the English were razzed worse than the Giants are booed in Brooklyn . Books were written and there was some talk of dissolving the Empire . Finally , the rules were changed . You could no longer pack the infield , but by this time Australia had two very fast bowlers and Englandnone . So , in the 1948 tests , Australian bowlers banged murderousshots right at English heads , and more books were written . New rules were proposed , but the Aussies say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Say the English , " Goodness ! They play as if all they wanted was to win ! " Reply the Aussies , " We do . " But to see the nation go mad , you must attend the Melbourne Cup , run at beautiful Flemington Race Track in early November . During the war an Australian stationed in New Guinea found himself in a jungle outpost when the Cup rolled around . There was no one to bet with , so he finally talked a naked savage into backing the favorite for a couple of bob . No self-respecting Australian is ever caught without " something going in the Cup . " The betting mania on this race is unbelievable , for horse racing is the national sport , betting the national vice . Lotteries are popular . State governments use them to support hospitals , and famous ones like The Golden Casket have been running for years . First prize in a big one might consist of two furnished homes , a $3000 sport car , and an income for life . Horse punters  --  as serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlays ) . A Melbourneclerk recently picked eight certain winners in a row and bet $6 all up . He won $65,000 for one afternoon 's work !  |p328But  to see the national spirit at its best , one must visit Oak Park for the August meeting . Oak Park is a cattle station on the vast plains of the north . There is no town , no railway , nothing but a big open space where the maximum amount of fun can be had . People begin to arrive six days before the races . They tent on station land . There 's a dance every night in the wool shed . Women wear their best . Right promptly the men  --  some of them near millionaires  --  start " to lay the dust . " They keep this up for six days , and then the serious drinking begins . From places as far as 400 miles away , people charter planes to see this fabulous meeting . By race time , Oak Park looks like a gold-rush town . Sixteen important bookmakers arrive to place odds on anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the betting is astronomical . A caterer sets up a shack where he feeds two hundred a day . Fellows and girls dance all night and raise hell all day . It 's Australia at the country races ! Reported a friend with a faraway look , " Oak Park ! Never in me life did I see such beautiful fist fights ! " But Australians can also achieve great things in harnessing their mighty land . In the Murray River Valley , they have discovered a dozen ways to use every drop of water they get . Great hydroelectricprojects use the streams as they form . Irrigation is practiced to make utter desert land flourish with fruits and cereals . Then dams store what 's left for fields lower down . In the Latrobe Valley , east of Melbourne , great deposits of brown coal have been uncovered and the wet , not-yet-formed coal is burned in special furnaces that use the steam for power and the dried-out coal for briquettes . The entire valley has become an Australian T.V.A. , a brilliant project with created villages , new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best was one some four hundred miles east of Oak Park . There , on a jungled tableland , I was led to the edge of a precipice and loaded into a swinging birdcage  --  called " The Flying Fox "  --  which swung out over a tremendous waterfall that roared some six hundred feet below me . Wind made the Fox sway sickeningly as spray leaped up from the black rocks below . When I reached the other side , I was taken to a cable car  --  an old coal truck dangling from a single strand of wire  --  and dropped sevenp329hundred feet straight down the cliff to the foot of the falls . It was a superb trip , if one looked up at the water . There was nothing when I stopped but the rock floor of the huge canyon , but I was led behind some rocks and into a deep cave . There , completely protected from any kind of assault , was hidden a complete hydroelectric plant capable of generating 110,000 volts . It served an area of 400,000 square miles , yet even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rock , up gloomy tunnels that sweated as I climbed them . The Australian , like his newer projects , is a powerful man , primarilyIrish and English . His ancestors were petty convicts  --  " Selectedby some of the smartest judges in England "  --  who had to be sent to Australia after the American Revolution had ended the traffic to Pennsylvania and Georgia . The Australian 's May/lower is the famous First Fleet of eleven ships which landed in 1788 . The Australian loves freedom . He has fought for it and established his nation in the face of great obstacles . When Captain Bligh of the Bounty was sent out to knock some discipline into the local lads , they proved too tough for him . They told him to go on back home , and he did so . An Australian journalist , long accustomed to the courtesies of American shops , returned to Melbourne and sought to buy his wife some chocolates . " Do n't have any , " the clerk snapped . " But there 's a box in the window ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands and yelled , " Hi , Mabel ! Come ' ere ! It 's the bloody Duke of Gloucester ! " A railroad crew in Queensland had a boss described as " the finest man who ever drew breath . " But one utterly cantankerous workman set out to lay him low and one day did so . Said the others , " Jake was right . We was get-tin ' to like the boss too much . " When the famous actor , Robert Morley , gave Sydney stagehands the same aloof treatment he had dished out in London and New York , they said nothing . But opening night of Edward , My Son was a riot . Curtains did n't work , the phone behaved disgracefully , and when Morley switched a light , nothing happened . Said one , " We gave him the old Australian handshake . " You 've never been insulted until you offend an Australian . Their scorn is vitriolic . They say proudly , " No bloody barstud can tell mep330how to do anything . But if you 're man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like a bloke who knows the tricks . " Australians prize this arrogance , even when directed against themselves . The journalist who was accused of mistaking himself for the Duke says , " I like it that way . When I was a lad , sheep shearers got three dollars for shearing a penful . And if the owner did n't like the results , he might not pay . You touched your cap , when you spoke to a man with money . Me ? I touch my cap to nobody . " In order to understand Australian labor , it is necessary to visit Broken Hill . You leave Sydney and travel west by fast train . You cross the Blue Mountains and then penetrate desert wastes for hundreds of miles . Names on your map refer only to stops where sheep may be loaded . You are in the Outback  --  the Never-Never  --  where wind rips across empty land . Monotony increases and you seem headed for nowhere . Then suddenly , you see a gaunt mine shaft , and as you approach you find not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many visitors call Broken Hill a miracle . It is . From its jagged crest have been taken multimillion in almost pure silver and lead . It was probably the richest single deposit of wealth ever discovered , and when tailings from silver mining were examined , they were found to contain new fortunes in zinc . In 1905 , a brilliant young engineer from London , described in the official history as " Mr. H. C. Hoover , who subsequently rose to the eminent position of the President of the United States , " establishedprocesses by which the zinc could be won . A closely held company controlled this fantastic wealth . It was named Broken Hill Proprietary  --  world famed as B.H.P. and yearly dividends of more than 1 00% were common . Now B.H.P. has turned its attention to making steel and is the biggest producer south of the Equator , the most powerful corporation in Australia , comparableonly to DuPont or Armstrong Vickers . B.H.P. developed when most men thought that riches existed only to make rich men richer . Australian workmen were not of that opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they established the principle that they were entitled to a substantial share of all profits . Today , Broken Hill is one of the most completely unionized cities on earth . And the unions are considered ideal patterns for others top331follow . There is little labor strife , no wildcatting , no irresponsible outside leaders to wreck production . Credit for this goes to the Barrier Industrial Council , an advisory board to which all unions must belong . It is the sole bargaining authority . It conducts Union Badge Shows , when practically every workman in Broken Hill  --  hairdressers , blacksmiths , bakers , municipal employees , bartenders , reporters  --  displays his union badge . To join one of the good unions in this ideal city , you must ( i ) have been born in Broken Hill ; or ( 2 ) been educated there since the first grade ; or ( 3 ) lived there for eight years . Thus there is no chance for radical outsiders to take over . Says management : " Those we have are radical enough ! " The city is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely close . " There 's legal closing , of course , but it 's open to a fluid interpretation . " The Barrier Council , assisted by the companies , have provided good doctors , a fine hospital , excellent education , race tracks , swimming pools , picnic grounds , honest gambling and public housing . For example , Mrs. Velda Watters , aged 31 , is married to a miner who works underground . She and Cyril were born in Broken Hill , but as a young man he did not fancy mining . He ran away with a circus , but he was gypped out of his pay so many times that Broken Hill stability began to look pretty good . He took a job with Zinc Corporation . The Watters live in a small concrete-block house with a corrugatedroof , which they bought for $11 a month . They are consideringa newer house , which Zinc will finance . They have recently bought a Kelvinator through Zinc at a discount of $32 . They enjoy many industrial benefits resulting from the great strikes . For 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medicine and surgery . For another 14 cents , they get free dental care , but they must pay for any false teeth . At Christmas , they get three-weeks ' vacation with pay and a cheap ride on a Zinc train to Adelaide , where they can rent a seashore tent for 8o cents a week . Cyril Watters makes about $65 a week plus all kinds of recreationalfacilities , a lending library , a pre-school kindergarten for his daughter , plus all the social services which labor has forced the **26;5565;TOOLONG just like you to bring home a present I have no use for , " Peg Callahan said acidly . " But I 'm sure we can use it , " Walt answered earnestly . They were having supper . Peg had cooked frankfurtersand beans . Walt leaned forward and continuedeating . Walt Callahan was a tall and rather thin man of sixty-three , with graying hair , a wearied , kindly face , and soft , blue eyes . His skin was roughened and weather-beaten . Sitting with his shirt sleeves rolled up , he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . She was fifty-three and had straight , black hair just beginning to turn gray , and dark , intense eyes . Her face was beginning to show its age ; her cheeks were slightly sunken , and there were wrinkles and hollows under her eyes . Her fingers were long and talonlike . She was sloppy-looking in an old black dress . " Of all the things to buy , " she said . Walt glanced at her appealingly . " How did you even happen to think of bringing something home ? " " Oh , I noticed it in a drugstore window on Vanp14Buren Street , and I . . . well . . . I thought it would be a nice kind of a little gadget to have in the house , and we can save money with it , too .

" " But , Peg  --  " " You would n't think of bringing home something for me , would you ? " A hurt , boyish expression crossed his face . " But I did bring this for you , for the home , Peg . I thought you 'd like it . " " Yes , and I suppose it will cause me twice as much trouble as it will be worth . " " Well , Peg , if you feel that way about it , I can take it back and get something else . Tell me something you 'd like , and I 'll bring it home to you tomorrow night . " She did n't answer him . He sat with his fork poised , waiting . " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Tell me if there 's anything you 'd rather have for thep15house or for yourself instead of this Little Gem Syphon , and I 'll get it . " " You wanted this useless piece of junk , keep it .

" Oh , nothing , nothing 's the matter . I suppose I expectedtoo much of you . Maybe it 's just the way of expressmen . Maybe no expressman ever thinks much of his wife . " " But I do think of you , Peg . I did when I bought this present , this . . . Little Gem thing . I thought you 'd like it .

I saw it in a drugstore windowlast week , and I was meaning to get it , but I kept forgetting , so this morning I tied a piece of string on my finger to make myself remember it . . . . And I did remember it . " " Your beans are getting cold , " she said curtly . He went on eating . " If you do n't want it , Peg , I 'll bring it back in the morning . "  | " We 'll keep it , " she said . Then she laughed in a rather forced manner . " And you tied a piece of string around your finger to remember it ? " " Well , anybody can forget . I have so much to rememberon the job , and what difference does it make if I do tie a string around my finger as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to get you a ball of twine , and I 'm goingto give you a little piece of it every day to help you remember . " " Remember what ? " " So many things . For one thing , you did n't aim straight and I had to scrub up the bathroom floor again . " Walt gazed off in embarrassment . " I 'm sorry , Peg , " he said humbly . " Go on , Walt , dear , eat your beans before they get cold , " she went on calmly . Walt went on eating . " It wo n't work , I know it wo n't , " Peg said impatiently . " Yes , it will . I read the booklet about it , and it 's easy to work . " " Even if it does work , it wo n't work for you . " " Why wo n't it work for me ? " Walt asked , standing by the table and looking down at Peg.  | " Do n't ask me . I just know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . " " But I always did . And if we had our own home , you 'd see how much I could do . " " You know , Walt dear , everything you do always comes out wrong . If you wash the dishes , I have to do them over again . The last time you washed the windows , I had to hire a man to do the job all over , they were so smudged . " " But , Peg , they were n't , " Walt said sincerely . He remembered , yes , he remembered very clearly , that he 'd done a good job with the windows . " Go on , now , get your Little Gem whipped cream or whatever it is . " " I 'll pour the coffee first and squirt it right in , and we 'll have whipped cream floating on top of the coffee . " Walt went to the kitchen and returned with two cups of coffee , which he set on the table , one in front of Peg and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back to the kitchen again to get the syphon . It was a cylindrical-shaped , chromium-finished bottle with a handle to be pressed . " All I did was to pour the cream into the syphon , screw in the Gold Seal Whiplash , they call it  --  it 's like a bullet  --  and let it cool in the icebox . Now watch and see  --  and , presto , I 'll show you how practical and handy this thingamagig is . " Peg sighed in boredom.  |p18Walt  went to her and , leaning over , held the mouth of the syphon above her coffee cup . " Now , do n't make a splash and shoot it out like a stream , " she said sharply . " Do n't worry , Peg . . . " Walt became confused , hesitated for a moment , and then pressed the handle . The whipped cream shot out . A quick look of disgust and abhorrence crossed Peg 's face . The cream and coffee were splashed on her clothes , on her face , on the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to do it ! " she screamed . Walt stood back , completely confused and awkwardlyholding the syphon . " It was an accident . I 'll clean it up . I guess I pressed too hard or something . " " You 'll clean it up ? " she asked , glaring at him . " It is n't serious , Peg . It 's just a little mess . It was an accident . " " Just a little mess . Look at the wall . You 've ruined my dress . The coffee was hot and burned my face . Just a little mess ? For years , Walt Callahan , you 've been making just a little mess for me . " " Here , I 'll get a rag and clean it up , " he said , turning to hurry into the kitchen . The kitchen was spotlessly clean . He stood in the center of the room , holding the syphon and not knowing what to do . " What 's the matter with you ? You 're as clumsy as a horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted . Then he realized he was looking for a rag . He was afraid he would n't find it . Then he saw one on the side of the sink . He picked it up , started back to the dining room , turned around , stopped , and became almost panicky . He looked at the syphon , which he was still holding . " Well , you can explain to the landlord why his walls are stained , I wo n't ! " Peg announced loudly . He quickly set down the syphon on the kitchen tableand returned to the dining room . " It wo n't stain the walls , Peg . " Peg was wiping her face with a handkerchief . She grabbed the rag out of his hand and snapped : " Let me do it . I 'm always cleaning up after you anyway . " She energetically wiped the few splotches of cream and coffee from the wall . They left a stain . " Mess and dirt and mess and dirt . I never saw a man who was as messy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from morning to night , and there 's no end to it . " She wiped the table , picked up her coffee cup , and went to the kitchen . Walt stood for a moment , ungainly , his long arms hanging at his sides . He shook his head sadly from side to side . Then he went to the kitchen and said , " I 'm sorry , Peg . " " Now the coffee 's cold . I 'll have to heat it again , and it will be too strong . Well , if you keep on drinkingstrong coffee , you 'll get ulcers , and then I supposep20they 'll say I did it . No matter what I do , there 's no end to it . I suppose I might as well give up . " " Peg , I only shot it too hard and got a little coffee and whipped cream on the wall and the table . " " And what about me ? " she snapped , turning around and glaring at him again . " I did n't hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalded me . You could have squirted coffee in my eye and blinded me . " " But I did n't , Peg , and I did n't mean to  --  " " Go get your coffee cup , and I 'll fix things . You should have let me do it in the first place . " Walt brought in the coffee cup . Then he returned to the dining room and sat down , waiting , again shaking his head from side to side.  --  But it was only a little accident , he explained to himself . Peg came in carrying two cups of coffee with whipped cream floating on top . " See , Peg , it does work . It makes whipped cream out of just ordinary cream . And you can make ice cream with it , too , " Walt said eagerly . Peg sat down opposite him and drank her coffee in silence . Walt sat comfortably slouched in his chair , soothed by the music from the radio . There was a soft , sleepyp21expression on his face . But he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Maybe now and then he 'd say something to her , or she 'd talk , and maybe they would talk about the past when they were young and about things they 'd done together , the places they 'd gone , the people they 'd known , and of the days when their kids had been young . Peg was resting quietly now , but she made him kind of nervous , because she seemed sore , and if he went out to the bedroom and tried to talk to her , she might bite his head off or something . She was in one of those silent moods of hers that gave him the jitters . She 'd complained about how tired she was , but she 'd said it in a way that almost made him think it was his fault . Hell , he 'd worked harder than she had today . She had n't had much house cleaning to do , and it did n't take much time to cook frankfurters and heat a can of baked beans , did it ? And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuttle , the Depot foreman , had hardly given him a minute 's peace . But , hell , he did n't want to think of things like that now . He just wanted to sit here in peace . The music . It was soft , the kind of music that used to make him feel sad and want to fall in love when he was young . Hearing it now made him feel lonely . Yes , he was lonely . Growing old , knowing you were spending the last years of your life with your wife should make you and her feel close together . You should be able to understand each other almost without having to say anything . You should feel close , thep22two of you remembering many happy days together and knowing you had each other . That was the way it should be , because that way would make living less lonely , especially in the evenings , like now , because , well . . . because at night you were just fagged out . And the night made you think how the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were on the other side of the hill , the side of the hill that goes down , down . And he 'd like to think of himself and Peg going down the hill together , hand in hand . He guessed that most men felt like this when they started getting old . And he could remember how , time and again , he used to imagine what it would be like when he and Peg began to get old , and the kids would be raised and married and have kids of their own . And now , think of it , the time had come , and he and Peg were old , an old couple . He used to imaginehimself sitting in his chair of a night , just as he was doing at this very minute . And he 'd seen himself and Peg talking and remembering , looking back on things and sometimes chuckling and laughing together , and having a bond of closeness as they would look back and talk about their good days together , and he 'd imagined that these nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best part of life and would give him feelings of being warm and contented inside . But , no , it was n't turning out this way , not tonight , and not on most other nights either , because if it was n't one thing that riled Peg it was another . And , come to think of it , he and Peg had lots theyp23could remember and talk about , like courtship , and the plans they used to make , and dances and walks in the moonlight . God , in those days Peg had been as beautiful as " That Old Sweetheart of Mine . " And then there was that time when both the kids had had pneumonia , and the way it had hit him just as if Jack Dempsey had socked him right flush in the solar plexus . He 'd been no good then , and he remembered going to work on those cold winter mornings like a man in a daze . She 'd been so wonderful , up night and day with the kids , taking better care of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she 'd been most beautiful . That was when the going had been rough , and they 'd pulled through . Now it ought to be easy , and they ought to enjoy the coming on of old age . Why did n't they ? Hell , what was he doing to cause all these rows and fights ? Walt sighed . He remembered , too , how he used to think that when he got old he 'd have Peg by his side if he got sick , and that she 'd take care of him and he would n't feel he was alone . Right now , he felt pretty much alone . God , yes , Peg had been a beautiful girl , and he 'd loved her . He sighed again . The music . It brought back all sorts of memories and feelings , and it made him think of things he 'd wanted to have and never did have . That 's why the music seemed so sad to him to/night , because when he had been young , music and songs like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished they 'd play When You and I WereYoung , Maggie . Lying in bed in the darkness , Peg thought of how , even without reading the booklet of instructions or ever having seen the syphon before , she had used it better than Walt . She could n't understand how he had ever been a teamster and driven a team of horses . He was so clumsy and could n't be relied on . Flow awkward and crude he 'd been making love to her . God Almighty , could she ever forget him , fumblingat his fly and in long underwear or those B.V.D 's men used to wear ? She giggled . She remembered him before his hair was gray , tall and thin and strong , but , God , how clumsy he used to be , and he 'd often made her feel almost sick . She had shuddered , and she had once said something to him about a horse  --  told him that he got into bed like a horse , or something like that . Now she could see that during their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood her , he would n't be sitting in the parlor like a log , paying no attention to her when she was nervous and blue . If he had just the slightest understanding ofp25her , he 'd come to her now . But , no , he sat in the parlorwith his newspaper and the radio , and with that sly , cunning look on his face . She might just as well be living alone as with him . How could she be more unhappy without him ? How ? Why , it was just the same as living alone , except that she had to wait on him hand and foot . She 'd never really wanted to marry him . God , why had she ? He 'd done it , done it to her . That night she 'd cooked dinner for him when her mother and father had gone out . The scene came back to her . Her mother , fat and gray-haired , telling her :  --  The way to a man 's heart is through his stomach .. Mother had wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before then , her mother had tried to get rid of her , to marry her off . And that night when she 'd cooked dinner for Walt , Mother had known . Mother had just about told her to do it . That look in Mother 's eyes . Her mother had done this to her . God , she hated to think this way of the dead , but it was true , it was , it was so . Could she ever forget that look in her mother 's eyes that night ? Her mother , with that look , had told her to go to bed with Walt . Her mother might just as well have made a whore of her . That night at dinner , she should have seen him for what he was . She could almost see him now , sittinglike a log , just as he was now in the parlor , and stuffing himself . He had n't really appreciated herp26then . He 'd broken a plate when he 'd helped her wash the dishes . And then , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that now . The pain , the humiliation of it . What a fool , what an innocent young fool she 'd been . Oh , God , why had it all happened to her ? And now it was too late . Here she was with her ruined life . Oh , why had her life been wasted this way ? How could she go on ? Go on , for what ? Go on until he got weak , and she had to nurse him like a cripple , wash him and bathe him and give him a bedpan the way her grandmother used to for her lazy old grandfa-ther ? She 'd only been a girl when her grandfather had died , but her mother had always talked of it and complained about how her grandmother had had to wait on the lazy old man hand and foot . Mother of God , was this to be her fate ? A Long , Long Trail A-Winding . . . . Even though this song made him sadder , he liked to hear it played over and over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were n't here in this room at all but somewhere else , by himself . He was so sad that he was almost happy in hissadness . . . the Land of my Dreams . . . He was in the land of his dreams , land of dreams in his ownp27mind . . . and . . . marching Down that long , long Trail . . . that 's what he 'd wanted , to march down the long , long trail of life with Peg and to know some of the happiness promised in the song . Yes , the things he 'd wanted in life and had n't gottenwere there in the song . And it made him think of Peg , too , when she 'd been a young girl . Sometimes he used to think of her as his Irish rose . He 'd like to hear that song , too , My Wild Irish Rose . That 's what he used to call her . . . his wild Irish rose . And that line in the song , take the bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long night awaiting until ... . Peg had been a beautiful girl , all right . . . . Good God , what had happened , and why did people change so much ? The song ended . Walt slumped in his chair . The radio announcer was selling something . He did n't listen . He was lost in his own thoughts . He wanted to remember , to think of Peg when she had been his wild Irish rose . God , how proud he 'd been of her and how he 'd thought he was n't good enough for her or worthy of her , and how he was even lousy to want to take her innocence . He remembered how he 'd gone to her house for supper . That was years ago , when he 'd just about come to believe he 'd lost her , and then she 'd invited him to dinner . All day on the wagon he 'd looked forward to the time when he 'd see her , and he 'd been afraid , afraid of what he 'd say and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she 'd turn him down and think him a fool.  |p28That  had been in June , a long time ago , back at the beginning of that long , long winding trail of his . He 'd been young and strong then , and on that day he 'd wrestled boxes , feeling almost as if he were an iron man . And he 'd imagined Peg watching him tossingboxes over the tail gate of the Continental Expresswagon and admiring him for his strength . And , singing to himself , he 'd talked to Nellie , his horse , as he 'd driven her clopping along Canal Street . He 'd thought that Peg , if she would only have him , would give him an incentive , something to work for . God , he 'd thought many things on that day . And , just think , it had been years ago . Walt sighed again . Walt grew nervous when Peg came into the parlor and sat on the big couch opposite his chair by the radio . He glanced guiltily at her and then looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reproduction of an oil painting called " Indiana Sunset " which he 'd won years ago in a church raffle . He thought it was very pretty , but he had n't really noticed it for years . " I was tired , " Peg said in a normal , friendly tone of voice , which surprised him . " I was listening to the radio . " She did n't answer . What should he say now ? Maybe she did n't want the radio on , but a man had to do something at home of an evening , especiallyp29when he could n't talk to his wife for fear of having her jump down his throat . " Do n't you want to listen to the radio , Peg ? They 've been playing old-time songs . " She did n't answer him . " Peg , " he blurted out , " I 'm sorry I was a little bit careless with that syphon . I did n't mean anything by it . I guess I just pressed too hard and it came out too fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and it was n't such a bad  --  " " You always were careless , " she interrupted , " and you never did give me enough consideration . " " Peg , I 'm sorry , I never meant any  --  " " It 's about time you said you were sorry . I was in there for hours and I had to come in here before you 'd say it . " Hours ? That was an exaggeration . But , then , there was no use in correcting her on this . It would only make her sore . " But , Peg , I thought you were sleeping , and I did n't want to disturb you . " " How could I sleep with the radio going ? " " It was n't on loud  --  was it ? " " If it was n't blasting , it was nearly blasting . " " I 'm sorry , Peg . If you 'd only called me , I 'd have turned the dial and made it softer . Here , I 'll do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as he started to rise from his chair . He sank back in the chair.  | " Peg , I 'll try , and let 's forget it . " He waited anxiously for her answer , hoping she 'd say something to show she 'd gotten over being angry . " Just be careful and do n't act like a horse any more or treat our home here like a stable , and we wo n't have any trouble . " " I 'll try , Peg . " She smiled at him . " Come on , Peg , " he said , rising , " slip me a kiss . " She rose slowly and let him kiss her . He huggedher tightly and then looked at her shyly and askingly . He could do it tonight . He could . He knew hecould . He took her by the hand , but as he started to lead her out of the parlor , the telephone rang . Peg rushed to answer it . " Yes , Dorothy , your father 's well . Yes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peg said on the telephone , laughing . She was good-humored now , and Walt felt better , only he wished the phone call had n't come just at this minute . He sat on the bed in their room , waiting . He was uneasy and felt as if he 'd done something wrong . But , hell , she was his wife . Still , look at their ages . At their ages , they should be done with it , should n't they ? But , God , to think that at his age he was n't allp31done below the belt , but now and then could still do it , that made a man a little proud , did n't it ? What would Dorothy think if she knew that her phone call had come just when ? She knew what men were like now . She loved Joe Zarilla , and they were happy . He loved his daughter ; she was a good girl . " And he 's all thumbs , dear , " Peg was saying , laughing lightly . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . . . " Peg laughed again . . . " and he squirted it all over the wall and all over me instead of in the coffee . " Hell , it had n't been that bad . " No , your father , the old dear , he 's not like Joe . Of course , he 's an old dear , but around the house here  --  I have to do everything . I 'm never done picking up afterhim . You would n't believe your eyes if you saw how much work one man can cause . Darling , you just ca n't know how clumsy he is . But , he 's an old dear anyway . " Walt thought that Peg was n't fair in what she was saying . But then , what the hell , since Peg was saying it all in a good-humored way , it was n't so bad . Come to think of it , years ago , he used to be pleased and flattered when she talked about him like this . He yawned . Now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had n't really wanted to , and he was kind of glad he would n't have to . Hell , two weeks ago after it he 'd felt . . . well . . . he 'd felt pretty rotten and as if he should n't have done it . He 'd sometimes felt that way , or moremonth . He wanted to say it , but he could n't just get the words out . He only thought it . He was too hurt to say anything . " Every day , every time you go to the bathroom , you mess the floor . " " No , I do n't . Maybe sometimes I 'm a little care  --  " " I ca n't remember a time since I married you that you did n't . " " Peggy , " he pleaded . She rose and paced back and forth in the room . Over the built-in mantel there was a mirror , and she paused to look at herself in it . He watched her , imaginingthat a drowning man must feel the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she fixed her hair . She did it up in a wild kind of way ; he could n't describe it or tell himself what the difference was , except that she used to fix her hair simply , and now it was curled and puffed and different  --  well , just wild-looking . She turned toward him . " Why do you do this to me ? " " What am I doing ? I have n't done anything to you , Peg . " " You know what you do to me , " she accused , and then she laughed peculiarly . " Peggy  --  let 's not quarrel . " " I 'm not quarreling . You 're always quarreling and criticizing . It 's you . " He was all mixed up. 64 " I would n't treat a dog , Walt Callahan , the way you 've treated me . " " Oh , for Christ sake , Peg , dry up , " he snapped , but not too angrily . It was just that . . . that , well . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , being nagged . " That 's a fine way to talk to me . That 's the kind of a man you are ! " " Well , Jesus Christ , a man does n't want to be nagged day in and day out . Why do n't you let up and not nag me so much ? " " You 're the one who nags . " As he started to answer her , she turned her back on him , shook her hips , and walked about with dainty steps , laughing in a strange , somewhat high-pitched way . " I 'm not one who nags , " she said in a gay falsetto . " I like to enjoy life and feel young . You 're the old lady in this home , not me . " He watched her , nodding his head from side to side . God , was this Peg ? Was this his wife ? Was this the mother of his children ? Was she the grandmother of his grandchildren ? Was she the innocent young Peg he 'd kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She glared at him with burning eyes . He could n't meet her gaze . Peg was changed . She had put makeup on , and he had n't remembered her having it on at supper . Shep66looked really old now . And though he did n't like to admit it even to himself , she looked ugly . Her face was thin . Her complexion was sallow , and she looked unhealthy . She let out a loud , wild laugh and screamed at him . " You know , Tom , there 's nothing you would n't stop at to hurt me . You know , Toni , what you want to do to me ? " He was so hurt , he did n't immediately take in the fact that she 'd called him Tom instead of Walt . When he did realize this , it just mixed him up all the more . Then it came to him that Tom had been her father 's name , old Tom Hennessey . He 'd fallen off an express wagon , dead drunk , cracked his skull , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Walt . " " Who said your name was Torn ? " she asked angrily . " Why , you just called me Tom . " " I did n't . You 're lying . Walt Callahan , how will you ever dare face your God , lying about me as you do , and to my face . Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor . " " But , Peg , what in the name of God are you talking about ? " " Do n't tell me you do n't tell the expressmen all about me . Do n't tell me you do n't drag me down and tell lies about me to the commonest wagonman and chauffeur . " " But , Peggy  --  "  | " Admit it ! Admit it ! If you were a man you 'd admitit . " " Peggy , I have n't been talking . . . " " If you murdered me in cold blood , you could n't have wronged me more than you have , Walter Callahan , " she said with quivering lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for the time to go to bed . Peg was in the bedroom , sewing , making over some of her old clothes . She 'd told him she was doing it in order to save him money , and so she would look nice when they went out together . He 'd wanted to say that he 'd asked her to go out to a movie with him tonight and that she 'd refused , but he had n't because that might have started another quarrel , and he did n't want to fight any more . He just wanted to sit here in peace and quiet and wait until he got sleepy . He was down in the mouth , all right . He puffed on a cigarette and was very careful about the ashes to be sure that he did n't spill any , because Peg was always bawling him out , saying that he was ruining the rugs with the ashes and making her do extra work . He did n't want to give cause for any more trouble tonight . But , Jesus , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only today he was talkingon the phone with Casey , who used to be one ofp68the clerks in the old days and was now a Dispatcher , and Casey mentioned Porky Mulroy . That went back a long time to the 1920 's , when Porky had been Route Inspector . And Casey 'd laughed and said the trouble with Porky was that he had n't worn the pants in his own home . Casey was always saying that about other fellows . But , goddamn it , sitting here alone with himself , could he say that he really wore the pants in his home ? God , everybody who knew Porky was so surprised that you could have knocked them over with a feather when they found out one fine morning that Porky had just picked up and left , throwing over his job and slamming the door on his wife . They 'd all laughed and said Porky had given his wife what she had coming to her , but that they had n't thought Porky had it in him . And then , oh , maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagonman that Porky had a job running a freight elevator and was hooked up with a young cutie and had even lost weight and was happy . When he 'd heard this news , he 'd secretly envied Porky , and he 'd even imagined doing the same thing himself . He could n't have walked out because of the kids , Dorothy and Jack . No , that was n't true . He 'd have been afraid to do it , and would n't even have known how , or how to find some young girl , or what to say to her if he had found one . And he 'd really loved and respected Peg . Yes , he had . But did he still love her ? Hell , he did n't know what he felt about Peg anyp69more , she kept him off guard and off balance so much . He guessed he was just tired and kind of playingout the schedule . Sometimes his feelings made him think of the White Sox or the St. Louis Browns playing out the schedule in September when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered fat Porky Mulroy ? He had n't thought about the Porker in years . It had been like being in another world in the days when he 'd known Porky and they 'd been young bucks on wagons and then in the Supervision . Everythinghad changed since then , even in the express business and the Company . There was much more efficiencynow , and you had to fill out all kinds of forms and papers and reports , and the young fellows on the trucks talked and thought differently from the way he and Porky and the old-timers had in their days . But Porky was the man everybody had laughed at because his wife had worn the pants in their home , and Porky had surprised them all by just up and leaving . It was too late for him to do anything like that now . He suddenly turned and looked to the back of the house . Peg was still quiet . The storm had blown over . He 'd sit here for a while now and think and remember , and then he 'd hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If he ran off , what kind of a job could he get , and he 'd lose his pension , and what could he do ? Maybe he could get some kind of a job like a night watchman or running a freightp70elevator . Old Simon Murray got a job as night watchmanafter going on his pension . But all this was just idle thinking . Who wanted a man his age ? What company or what woman would want a man his age ? A funny nervous feeling was creeping through him . He often had it . Maybe he was getting the jitters . The house was so quiet now . Peg was still in her room sewing , and it was peaceful . But he felt as if it was n't going to stay peaceful , as if something was goingto happen , something was going to happen to him . He knew that only he and Peg were in the house , and yet it was as if they were n't alone . He felt as if he just wanted to run out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughing and you could hear funny stories and laugh right up from your belly . What could he do ? He was getting all knotted up inside himself . Peg came into the parlor with two glasses of beer . " I thought you 'd like a glass of beer , " she said , speaking very calmly . Walt was so startled that he did n't react at first . Then he said : " Gee , thanks , Peg . A glass of beer would hit the spot right now . " He took a drink . It tasted good . He 'd been thirstyp71but he had n't even realized it while sitting here and thinking , and he was thankful that Peg had come in , and that she was friendly again and had gotten all the nervousness out of her system . Only why could n't she get it out of her system on Marty the butcher or the men in the supermarket or Mr. Carlton in the drugstore or the neighbors , or on anybody but him ? " Ah , " he sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can thank me for thinking of you . I always think of you . " " I do , gee , thanks , Peg . It just hits the spot . " " It will relax you , " she said , taking a drink herself . He did n't get that . He did n't think he needed to be relaxed . " Do you remember that black dress of mine , that old one ? " " Yeh , " he said , but as Peg went on describing it his mind wandered and he no longer was listening to her . " Yeh , " he repeated . " You wo n't know it when you see it on me , the way I 'm fixing it up . " " Swell , swell . You know , Peg , you can do things like that mighty well . " " Oh , I 'm not so good . You should see what Mrs. Zorobowski down the street can do . But , Walt , when I finish with this dress , it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . " " Gee , that 's swell . We can go out to dinner the firstp72time you wear it and make it the occasion for a cele-bration . " " Celebration for what ? " " Oh , just to celebrate . After all , Peg , we 're not too old to have a good time . " A few sips of beer had really given him a lift . " There 's nothing to celebrate , " Peg said wearily . Disappointed , he looked at her quizzically . " Walt , do n't you think it 's clever of me to make over an old dress the way I 'm doing ? " " Of course , I do , Peg . " " Well , why do n't you tell me ? " " But I just did tell you . " " Yes , but only after I had to ask you to . " Walt wondered if he should n't make it a rule to give her more compliments . Had n't he made a resolutionbefore supper to be more thoughtful and considerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't show her enough consideration ? When they 'd first been married , of course he 'd danced attention on her , but you change and ca n't be that way all the time , can you ? Well , he was going to be more thoughtful . And he 'd bring her home little presents , and maybe that would help . Only , bringing home that Little Gem Syphon had n't pleased her . He finished his beer on this thought . " Here , Walt , let me get you another glass of beer . " He did n't think he ought to have another one . Too much beer would put on weight . He did n't want to get fat.  | " Oh , I guess one 's enough . " Then he remembered that he had n't said thanks or thank you to her . There he was , right away , right off the reel after making a resolution , forgetting to show her these little attentions . Peg picked up the two glasses and left the parlor . She quickly returned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , as she set one beside him . " Now , drink your beer and do n't sit there sulking at me like a little boy . I only tell you things for your own good . " He smiled . But this kind of talk from Peg did n't really please him . Still , she was being friendly , and she had brought him the beer . And it did taste good , and he did n't feel so down in the mouth now . This second glass would make him feel better , and he could go to bed relaxed and get himself a good night 's sleep . But he 'd better turn in right after he drank it . Getting up at five-thirty in the morning was n't easy for a man his age if he did n't get his sleep . " Walt , I do n't want you to fight with me , " Peg said , speaking with a ring of sincerity in her voice . " Peg , why should I want to fight with you ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you do n't know what it does to me , how it makes me feel . " It did n't make him feel so good , either . He wanted her to know this . But she went on talking . " If you wo n't fight and quarrel with me , and if you wo n't spill ashes and pee on the bathroom floorp74and not be careless , we 'll get along , and I 'll be happy and not have any complaints . " Walt smiled sheepishly . She always made him want to crawl into a corner about that bathroom business , and now and then he did n't aim straight , but , God , she exaggerated it all . Still , he would n't argue with her , because if you once started she could argueback for hours . Like that night , about three weeks ago , when she 'd disputed with him until three o'clock in the morning . He 'd gone to work with only two hours sleep . Jack Hartshorn , who relieved him at four o'clock every day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , saying :  --  What 's the matter , Walt , did the old lady take it all out of you last night ? He 'd grinned , letting Jack believe that was the reason he was so bushed . Sure , his old lady had done him in and taken it all out of him , but not the way Jack had imagined but by arguing with him until his tongue had been almost hanging out . " Tell me , Walt , are n't you sorry ? " Walt did n't want to say it , but it was the easiest thing for him to do . " Yes , Peg . " " And you 're not going to start any more fights with me ? " They drank their beer . It tasted very good to Walt . " Oh , another glass of beer wo n't hurt you in the least , " Peg said . " How about you , Peg ? "  |p75Peg  pointed to her glass beside her ; it was more than half full . Then she took his glass out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wait on him this way , she would suddenly snap at him then and blame him . But she was n't that way now . She was in one of her best moods . Maybe they could have a good time just sitting here and talking . If they did , it sure would be worth it to lose a few hours ' sleep . " Why are n't you always the way you are now , Walt ? " she asked him as she returned with another glass of beer . " But , Peg , I want to be . I do n't want to quarrel . " " And do you think I do ? All I think of is you . I want to take care of you . At your time of life a man needs to be careful about himself , and you know , Walt , you never did know how to take care of your-self . " Walt wanted to talk about other things . This subjectmade him too uneasy . But , still , it did please him to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared for him . Maybe she got so nervous because she worried about him . Of late he 'd been thinking again and again that she no longer loved him , that she did n't care if he did or did n't enjoy any little happiness during the rest of his life . But when she talked this way about taking care of him , well , yes , it did please him mightily , even if it did seem that she was telling him at the same time that he was n't so much of a man.  |p76He  took another drink of beer . And her voice , as she talked to him now , was soft , and maybe there was love in it . Underneath everything else she was still Peg , the girl and the woman he 'd loved . When they were young , he used to love her voice , her voice and her hair . Her voice had seemed so soft and gentle to him , so feminine , and he remembered that secretly he used to call it the voice of love itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronx cheer and the razzle-dazzle , though , from the fellows at the Express Company if he 'd ever told them he had such thoughts ? But her voice did make him remember . She was talking softly to him now , and he was only half listening , and he was feeling as if he might almostbe in a dream , although he knew it was n't a dream , but it was almost like being in a dream , the way he was feeling , with Peg talking to him , her voice seeming soft and , yes , like it was when he first had known her . And he was thinking of her hair , too . When your hair has turned to silver .... There was gray in her hair now , and it was kind of stringy , the black hair that once , once upon a time , he had loved . He used to love to look at it , and to feel it and stroke it and put his face into it and smell it and kiss it . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of beer . " One more beer wo n't hurt you , Walt . It will be good for you , " she said solicitously.  |p77He  wanted to tell her that he had had enough , but he did n't . She left the parlor with the empty glass . Peg had not finished even her second glass . " Peg , I 'm not such a bad fellow , I 'm not , " Walt exclaimed , his voice thick and pleading . He was feeling good , in a good mood . He wanted to talk , wanted to tell Peg about himself so she 'd understand that he was decent , and that he went along as well as the next fellow did , with his shoulder to the wheel . He wanted her to know this . He could n't remember how many glasses of beer he 'd drunk , but it was more than he 'd had in one hell of a long time . But then he was safe . Nothing could happen to him because he was right here in his own home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him about drinking now , as she 'd been sometimes when he 'd gotten tanked up . In fact , she was serving him the beer , so it was all right . Peg was letting him drink . Had n't she told him it would be good for him ? And Peg could put him to bed , and she would n't nag him about it , either , because she 'd told him to do it . Why , she was drinking a glass of beer herself . Peg was n't a spring chicken any more , but , then , he was n't young himself . She had given him the best of her . He did care for her , and that was why thisp78quarreling and haggling and nagging bothered him so much . But they were n't quarreling and fighting now , and they could make up . Peg was in a good mood , and he could see that she did n't mean a lot of the things she said . Why , he and Peg were even havinga good time together right here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few glasses of beer will be good for you , so long as you do n't get sick and pass out , " Peg said , placing another glass on the small table beside him. " 1 'm not drunk . I 'm not gon na get drunk and get sick and pass . . . pass out , " Walt said , speaking slowly but confidently . Peg sipped her beer . Walt gulped his . " Why , after all , do n't I have to get up . . . and get to work early . . . in the mornin ' ? " " I bought all of this beer today , " she said . " I just thought I ought to have it in the house for you . " This pleased him . It proved that Peg did think of him and of what he liked . Peg could be mighty good and sweet  --  yes , she could when she was n't in one of her nervous moods . No , sir , knowing her , he would n't trade her for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he understood her . Walt grinned foolishly . Peg , watching him and noticinghis grin , frowned briefly . " And I bought Schlitz beer , because I know it 's the beer you like best . " Peg looked down at her partially empty glass . She was moving her legs with nervous regularity . He no/ticed her legs . They were still nice and shapely . Yes , she still had good legs . He told himself that he really felt very sympathetic to Peg . After all , she was growing old , just as he was . And was n't it harder on a woman to grow old and lose her looks and her figure than it was on a man ? Yes , it was , it was sadder for a woman . He must rememberthis and make allowances for Peg . After all , words were only words , and when she was a little upset he ought to try to keep cool and wait for the storm to blow over . Because the nervous , nagging Peg was n't really Peg . Peg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the real Peg . " I was thinkin ' , Peg . . . I was thinkin ' we 've gone through a lot together . . . have n't we .. . Peg , old girl ? " He saw the dark look on her face . It frightened him a little . What had he said ? Then he guessed that maybe it was because he 'd called her " old girl . " " It 's been hard on me , and you know , Walt , you have n't always been as attentive and careful as you might have been . " The dark look vanished from her face . Her voice was soft and low and friendly . " I tried to , Peg . I have . I . . . think I can honestly . . . honestly say I tried to be . . . careful and ... attentive and to be a good . . . husband . And I always . . . work , and I think I can honestly say . . . I worked . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to tell Pegp80that now he sometimes felt the years of work and the onset of age . But , the hell with it , the hell with it . Why should he think of this now , when he was having a good time ? Walt drained his glass of beer . Then he looked at the empty glass . He wanted another , but he did n't know whether or not he should have it , and he did n't know if Peg would like it . He did n't dare ask her for fear she might say no . But he had this thirst for another beer . What the hell , anotherglass would n't hurt him . Suddenly he got up and lurched to the bathroom . He determined to aim straight , but he did n't . Panickyand perspiring , he snatched wads of toilet paper and bent down to wipe up the floor where some of his urine had hit . He did n't want her to be telling him about it . It humiliated him . The odor depressed and almost sickened him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends at work saw him now and should know why he was doing this , would n't they lay it into him ? He wiped up the floor sloppily and got more wads of toilet paper and did it over again . He did n't like this , getting some of it on his fingers . He dropped the wads into the toilet bowl , pulled the chain , and anxiouslywashed his hands . Then , after drying them , he saw that all the paper had n't been flushed down . He got panicky and pulled the chain again . He waited tensely . One wad still had n't gone down . He waited in growing panic for the bowl to refill so that he couldp81flush it again . Then he flushed it a third time . The last wad went down . He was safe . He sighed with relief . He shyly went back to the parlor , walking with a slight stagger and trying to think of what he would tell Peg if she asked him questions or criticized him for having been in the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in case she 'd heard the toilet flushing . Peg sat waiting for him , a beaming smile on her face . She had placed another glass of beer on the table beside his chair . " You 're not sick , are you ? " " No , no , not at all . " " You were in the bathroom so long . " " I had to be , " he said , embarrassed . He sat down and , feigning surprise at seeing anotherglass of beer , said : " Gee , thanks for pouring my beer , Peg . " " I thought another glass would n't hurt you . " He need n't have sweated and worried about what Peg would say . " No , it wo n't hurt me . It 's the last glass I 'll drink tonight . And then I 'm gon na turn in . " Peg had n't finished her second glass of beer yet . Walt staggered out of the bathroom . He had n't aimed straight , but , the hell with it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he correctedhimself . He was n't drunk . He could still hold his beer . He was n't drunk . He was just a little drunk . He lumbered into the parlor and dropped heavily into his chair . He tried to remember what he 'd been talking about to Peg , but it had gone from his mind . He 'd been telling her about himself , something importantabout himself . But whatever it was , it had slipped his mind . He lurched as he picked up his glass and gulped the beer in it . He wanted more immediately . " Peg , can I have another glass of . . . beer ? " " You 're drunk already , and you have to go to work tomorrow . Why , your tongue is thick . You 're talking like a drunken man . " " I 'm not drunk . . . just feeling good . " " You ca n't control yourself . You 've been running to the bathroom every two minutes . " " You got to go to bathroom , the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was saying . A puzzled , stupid expression came over his face . Then , and as though with an effort , he said , " Yourself . " " When you get drunk , the real animal , the beast you are comes out , " she said cruelly . " What the hell you talking about ? " " You know what I 'm talking about , Walt Callahan ! You know good and well . " He hiccupped . He knew he ought to go to bed . Go to bed and sleep . Tomorrow . Work . It was late . Late . He was sleepy.  |p83He  hiccupped again . Sleep . He was getting drunk . Getting drunk . He stared at the empty beer glass . He lumbered to his feet . " I 'm gon na . . . have another beer . " She jumped up and snatched his glass . " Do n't you take my glass . " " I 'm only getting you the beer , " she said in an angryvoice ; she was almost in tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , . puzzled . He yawned . He hiccupped . Damn her ! He was going to show her who wore the pants in this family . Trouble with too many women , they wanted to wear the pants . Peg came back smiling . She set the beer down before him . " You would n't have this beer to drink if I had n't thought of you and ordered it today . I paid a boy fifteen cents to carry it home for me . I could n't carry it myself . " " I paid for it . " " I 'll be busy all day tomorrow cleaning up the drunken mess you 've made tonight . " Walt took the glass and drank . He wiped his lips with the back of his hand . " Now , what you say ? " he said , sitting down . He sat , slumped in an ungainly position , with his mouth hanging open.  |p84Lying  in the darkness , on the outside of the bed , Walt smelled of beer and sweat . Peg was beside him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself that she was all he had now . He wanted to make up to her . He wanted to make love to her . He did n't want her to be sore at him . " You 'd still be swilling beer like a pig in the trough if there was any left to drink , " Peg said bitterly . " I only drank . . . drank . . . all I did . " " That 's what I get for my thoughtfulness and consideration . And he gets drunk . I have to sleep with a pig . Why do n't you bring a horse in my bed and let it drop horse turds on my pillow ? " " Peg . . . I love . . . you , " he muttered feebly . " Love ! I suppose you drank so much beer that you 'll wet the bed . " Walt passed out and began to snore . He did n't hear another word she said as she sat up in bed beside him , berating him . The streetcar was crowded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . And how would he get through the day 's work ? He did n't know.  |p85Luckily  , he had gotten a seat . If he had to hang on a strap this morning , he could n't take it . His head ! What a goddamned fool he had been , drinking so much beer . His head ! And it was hard trying to keep his eyes open . The car was bumping along , getting more crowded at each stop . The conductor was barking at the passengers . He had trouble keeping his eyes open . He felt bloated . And his head ! As soon as he got down to the Depot , he 'd send out for coffee . God , why had he done it ? It had n't been any fun . But Peg had let him drink all that beer . Why had n't she stopped him ? Why had n't she just put her foot down and not gone on giving him more ? Peg should n't have let him do it . His head ! He remembered getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and Peg saying something about horses and . . . His head ! Walt fell asleep in the crowded streetcar.  |p86Peg  did n't want to get up and look at the mess Walt had made in the parlor . Cleaning his mess , that was what her life had come to . She did n't know what time it was . She did n't care . She did n't want to get up and face the day . Oh , God , she hated to wake up in the morning . Every morning , waking up to face the day . He had gone to work . Some Express wives got up at five or six in the morning and cooked their husbands ' breakfast . But maybe those wives had husbandswho appreciated it . She laughed loudly , several times . Imagine , she told herself , any expressman appreciatingwhat his wife did for him . But some of them did n't have wives , they had slaves . Was n't that what he wanted her to be  --  his slave ? He treated her like a slave . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , ox that he was , he had wakened her when he got out of bed . And the alarm clock . It rang in her ears . It rang so that she wanted to break it , smash it , smash it to smithereens . She wanted to smash every alarm clock in the world . Every morning , the alarm clock woke her up , and she could n't get back to sleep . She turned over on her side and sniffled . Then the tears came . She sobbed , and her body quivered andp87shook . She moaned . She groaned . She exclaimed loudly : " Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! " She kicked her legs . She flailed her arms . With her thighs pressed together tightly , she lay with her body stretched and taut , and a nameless fear took hold of her . It seemed as though the fears that gripped her were presences hovering in the room . She had goose pimples . She shivered and shuddered , wanting to scream out . She imagined she did scream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seeming presences in the darkened bedroom would speak to her and accuse her . She heard nothing . Walt Callahan stood in his small Dispatcher 's booth , looking at the pail of coffee set before him on the built-in desk . It was cluttered with papers . Outside , the Depot was noisy . It was stacked with all kinds of freight . Trailers and trucks were backed up side by side against the platform . ' Walt often liked to describe this by saying the vehicles were backed against the loading platform ass by ass . Freight handlers were bustling about , lugging , pushing , wheeling , and sorting freight . Wagonmen with uniformcaps were sidling in and out of the freight onp88the platform , talking , standing near their vehicles . Route Inspectors were moving around , giving instructions to their men about the morning deliveries . A tractor backed into a trailer with a clang , hooked it on , and in a moment , its motor sputtering , it was noisily moving out . There was bustle , clatter , shouting of voices , crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all so familiar to him . Most mornings he hardly heard it , or , even when he did , it was almost as if he did n't hear it , it was so usual . Today it beat in on him , and the whole Depot was like one goddamnmadhouse . He hoped the coffee would wake him and pick him up . God , would four o'clock ever come ? Usually , time passed so fast , it flew by . And on those days he did n't want time to fly by so fast , because at the end of the day there was home , going home . He often did n't want to leave because he never knew what Peg would be like . But he felt sick today . The coffee . It was brown . The brown color was pretty . He looked at the coffee . He took a gulp from the small tin pail . After it went down , he held his breath for a moment , waiting to discover if it helped . He looked through the smudgy window of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't know if he could last out the day . His head was still aching , but the aspirin he 'd taken was helping a little . Now it was mostly tiredness . He took another gulp of coffee . How could he get through the day ?  |p89Wearing  her bathrobe , and with her hair tangled and uncombed , Peg was an aging , haggard , torturedlookingwoman . There was no makeup on her thin face . There were hollows under her eyes . They shone brightly , and their gaze was fixed . The lines about her mouth seemed more pronounced than usual , and her hands and wrists looked almost scrawny . She stared into the mirror over the mantelpiece and saw a confused image of a woman younger than herself , with a face less marked by years and sufferingthan her own . She saw a rather handsome face crowned with black hair untouched by gray . She saw round , rosy cheeks and passionate , glittering , dark eyes . She saw herself as a beautiful woman , and in the mirror the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracious . She put her right hand over her face and continued to stare between her fingers for some moments . She hummed the tune of a song with a title and words that she had forgotten . She turned and stared rigidly about the parlor , gazing as though she saw something very interesting . She ran her hand through her hair , mussing it more and making it look even more wild and weedy . She shuddered and trembled with fear . It seemed to her that she was about to do something terrible , and she did n't even know what it was . " Oh , why does n't he hit me over the head and tellp90me to stop it . . . stop it ! . . stop it ! " she cried out plaintively to the empty room . Then she shook her head , and her face relaxed . She was sleepy , half asleep , she told herself . She was only waking up . She had been dreaming on her feet . And last night she 'd had some horrible dream she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dead man and that she was filled with horror . She shuddered as she remembered even this much of her dream.  --  Oh , how can I face this day ? she silently asked herself . And look at the room . It was filthy , worse than a stable or a pigpen . And the odor of tobacco and stale beer was enough to make a woman ill . A newspaper lay on the floor near Walt 's chair , and there were ashes all over the rug . The ash tray on the small table beside her chair was filled , and the one on the table next to his was overflowing , with ashes on the table , too . And there were two beer glasses on one end . She became furious and said aloud : " I 've never seen such a filthy room in my life . " She turned and went out to the kitchen to drink her morning coffee . Walt did n't have time to stop and know how he felt . The morning rush was on , and the Depot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stood in his booth , giving orders to drivers who came and went , talking to Route Inspectors , speaking on the telephone , thinking about the loads he had to get out in order to clean up for the morning . Everything looked as if it were in disorder , but to Walt it was n't . He knew what he was doing , what drivers he would pick for loads , and that in another hour or hour and a half he 'd have the Depot platform clean as a whistleand ready to receive the trailers that would be coming in with transfer loads . He got a kick out of his work , having a whole Depot full of freight to get out , watching and knowing that it would go , load by load , cleaning it out so that the Depot would be cleared and dull and empty . And it was n't as hard as it seemed . Hell , he 'd been dispatching so long that he could just about do it in his sleep . And when he worked under pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or about home and Peg . He lost himself here in these details of work . He saw lots of people , some of them friends of his . He got on well with most of them , did n't have serious trouble with his own drivers , and usually he just felt good here on the platform and in his Dispatcher 's booth . And he liked the noise and activity , the shouts of the billers sometimes rising singsong above the crashing noise of boxes , and he liked to see the platformmen going by carrying and pushing the freight . He got a thrill out of his work . Yes , it gave him a sense of being connected with a big undertaking thatp92was important in the life . of the country , the moving of freight . This morning he was pleased about his work . He was holding up after having come in this morning with a hangover . Everything was going along just as usual . And he was doing his job even though he was fagged out . He 'd pepped himself up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his headache . And , damn it , that was pretty good for a man his age . It was ! Hell , he 'd even thought of calling up and sayinghe was sick and not coming down today . He would have done it except that he 'd been afraid Peg would have been on his tail at home all day , nagging and telling him how drunk he 'd been . He was glad he had n't stayed home . He 'd just have had a lousy day , and maybe Peg would have carried on , telling him how women were stronger than men and she was stronger than he was . That was what she 'd done the last time he 'd been home sick , last winter when he 'd had that touch of the flu . Bobby Dickson , who wrote sheets for him , came into the booth . Bobby was sandy-haired , short , cheerful , and always smiling . " Walt , Mr. Tuttle the Depot Foreman told me ... " " What 's eating his ass this morning ? He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He told me to tell you you 're slipping ! " Walt made a waving gesture of dismissal with his left hand.  | " His old lady gave him hell again maybe for takin ' a pee . " Somehow , he got pleasure out of thinking that Tuttle was henpecked . If they knew here at the Companyhow much he was , they 'd be surprised . " The point is , Walt , I have a message I am instructed to deliver to you from Mr. Tuttle , the .. . say , what the hell is his title again , I plumb forgot it ? " " Depot Foreman . And I know what 's on his mind  --  them two stiffs . Well , here , take this pail and run across the street and get me some coffee and tell him that cars are on the way in to get them . Heinie Mueller promised me he 'd get them for me . " " He always gets this way about getting stiffs delivered . I told him that 's because he 's a brother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What did he say ? " Walt asked , laughing . " He said that if I was in workin ' for him I 'd be out of work . " Walt chuckled . " He 's dead , a brother to a stiff . All right , Bobby , get me the java and tell Mr. Tuttle to find something else to worry about , now that I 've got his two brothers in coffins well provided for . " " Okay , Walt . " Bobby took the coffee pail and hopped out of the booth . Suddenly Walt felt tired and depressed . Hep94dropped onto his chair . Those stiffs he had to get delivered . Some day he 'd be a stiff . That would be all for him , and he 'd just be a stiff , forgotten , except maybe now and then when someone remembered him the way he would now and then remember and think about Patsy McLaughlin and Jim O'Neill and Mike Mulrooney and Billie O'Brien and Gas-House McGinty . And . . . He lit a cigarette to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry back with the coffee . " Mr. Callahan , " said Tommy Gustav , one of his drivers . Walt looked up . " What the hell do you want ? " Walt asked with mock gruffness . " Jesus Christ , I always get the toughest loads . When am I ever going to get a break , Mr. Callahan ? " " Come on , Gustav , come on , quit feeling sorry for yourself . When I was your age , you should have seen the loads I used to haul . And the hours I put in . " " I know that 's maybe so . My old man killed himselfworkin ' in a steel mill , too . But I do n't want that . I believe in progress for a workin'man . " " Hell , and look at the pay you get . God , we did n't begin to draw down pay like you boys do . " " It 's not so much when you have a family . I came down last payday with a dime in my pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , Gustav , what 's your beef ? "  | " I 'm late feedin ' every day . Then I catch hell from Martinov , my boss , because I get on my routes late . I got twenty minutes overtime last night , and he burned my ass off , burned it right clean off me this mornin ' . " " If you did n't jaw so much , you would n't be late gettin ' on your route . Your loads are no heavier than a lot of others I got to dish out here every mornin ' . Boy , my job is to get freight out of the Depot . And what 's your truck for ? " " Well , I do the best I can , and I do n't see why Martinov should burn me . " " Hey , Walt ! How you doin ' ? " a fat driver called cheerfully as he passed Walt 's booth . " Hello , Charlie , " Walt called back with a wave of his hand . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , boy  --  get on the ball , and I 'll see what I can do for you tomorrow mornin ' . And tell Martinov to see me about your mornin ' loads . You work for me in the mornin ' . I 'll take care of him if he burns you up again . Hell , I was dispatchin ' when he was a punk on a single wagon in the old days . " " Thanks , Mr. Callahan . " " Walt 's the name . " " Thanks , Walt . " Walt watched Gustav leave the booth . He was a strapping young fellow , strong and decent , too . What was the kid 's home life like ? Walt suddenly thought of the time when he was asp96young as Gustay . But the phone in his booth rang , breaking into the mood of nostalgia which came upon him . Peg was on her knees , slowly scrubbing the bathroom floor , thinking how she 'd scrubbed it yesterday , and only because of Walt she had to do it all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of his filthy habits . But now the smell was gone . She smelled only soap and water . She liked the smell of soap . It was a clean smell . She liked clean smells because she was a clean woman . But would Walt ever stop ? Did he care how hard she worked ? For twenty years , for more than twenty years , for all the years of their life together , she had asked him , she had pleaded with him , she had begged him and begged him and begged him about the bathroom floor . He did it only to make her get down on her knees and scrub . He had taken ten years off her life and her beauty just by making her scrub the bathroom floor . Her face looked anguished . Her hair fell over her forehead . She perspired . She felt aches in her arms and cramps in her legs . Her knees hurt . She scrubbed the floor forlornly.  --  Scrubbing your piss , she said aloud to the grinning , hateful image of her husband that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Heinie , " Walt said into the telephone mouthpiece , " I had too much beer last night . " " I ca n't do that any more , not on a night when I got to get up and come down here to work the next morning . " " Hell , Heinie , you been up there in that departmentso long you could run things in your sleep . How long you been in the Wagon Department , Heinie ? Since Father Time was born ? " " I been here since I came back from the War in 1918 . " " Jesus , that war . It sounds like the Civil War to me . " " What did your old lady say about you drinkin ' , Walt ? " " She was with me . " " Did she get drunk , too ? " Heinie asked enthusiastically . " No , Heinie , she just took care of me . I had such a good time , though , Heinie , that I do n't mind the hangover , " Walt explained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what had happenedthan what was really so . " And , Heinie , you know I feel pretty chipper despite all I drank . Send over one of your lumber heads from the Department so I can knock on wood . I 'm doing pretty good , Heinie , at my age . "  | " I 'm in good shape , Walt , except for my dogs . How 's your dogs , Walt ? " " Pretty good , Heinie , pretty good . I 'm on them more than you , and they bother me now and then , but not too much . Yep , Heinie , the dogs are holdin ' pretty good . " " I 'm glad to hear that , Walt ; you and I are among the few old-timers left now . " " That 's so . " " And I tell you , Walt , we 're lucky because of our ladies . Your old woman , Walt , and mine are too good to shoot . " Heinie let out a cackling laugh . " When you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you begin to have dogs like an old man 's pecker , the old lady you got makes all the difference in the world , and we got old girls to be proud of . " " Yes , Heinie , I 'm with you on that proposition , " Walt answered . " I took care of your stiffs , too . The cars are on the way to pick ' em up . " " Thanks , Heinie , you 're a prince . And it 'll take Tuttle off my neck . " " Say , is he still livin ' ? " " He 's worse than he ever was , Heinie . " " Well , Walt , any time you need a car to take care of him the way I 'm takin ' care of those two stiffs of yours this morning , you know who to call . " They both laughed . " Well , keep up the good work , Walt . "  | " Same for you , Heinie , and remember me to the old lady . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walt stood in his booth for a moment . An overpowering sadness came upon him . He was thinking of Heinie Mueller . Heinie was growing old here in the Express Company , a happier man than he . And it was because Heinie had a different wife . Heinie , none of the men down here in the Company , knew what his home life was like . He did n't want them to know . They all thought he was a jolly , happy man , and he did n't want them to think anything else , but , still . . . " Walt , you got to come out and see about that trailer load Stoneman 's takin ' to Atlantic , " Bobby said at the entrance to the booth . " Okay . " Walt followed Bobby onto the platform . He still felt despair in his heart . And suddenly he was weak . His hangover was coming back on him . " Mother , you really ought to fix yourself up , " Dorothysaid , as she and Peg sat talking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full lips , and a round , pleasant face . She was beginning to look stout and gave the appearance of being very contented.  | " What is there for me to fix up for ? " Peg asked in an emotionless tone of voice . Dorothy became uneasy . Her mother seemed a littlefoolish , and she looked awful , like the wrath of God . But she told herself she 'd better be careful about what she said , because she did n't want to argue . Her attitude toward her mother kept changing . At times she was angry with her and disliked her . They had even quarreled violently and bitterly . And her mother had been very spiteful and unfriendly when she and Joe had gotten married . But Joe was such an understanding , tolerant kind of person . Then she and her mother had a long , terrible quarrel , but they had made up , and she was glad they had . Now she did n't quarrel with her mother , and if she did , she always felt badly about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now that she was a mother herself , she felt this more strongly . But every time she got to feeling too sorry about her own mother , to thinking she should n't criticize her mother , then something would happen and she would have to control herself so as not to become angry all over again . And a deep , silent resentment of her mother would burn in her . But then she would tell herself it was all past and was best forgotten . You could n't be happy if you kept raking up the past and brooding about it . Sometimes she 'd remember how her mother used to scream at her and nag her when she 'd been a child , and she 'd recall scenes when she thought she 'd even hated her mother . Her motherp101had n't done much to give her a happy childhood . But she really forgave her for everything . But today Dorothy felt genuinely sorry for Peg . She had come over and brought her mother a nice blouse as a present and she had a tie for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least pleased by the gift and had said that Walt would n't look well in the tie . This had disappointed Dorothy . But , despite this , she was determined to be friendly with her mother and to try to cheer up the poor thing . " Your father was drunk last night . I spent all morning cleaning up after him . " " Where did he go  --  out with some of the boys from the Express Company ? " " He turned my home here into a saloon . " " What did he do ? " Dorothy asked . " He turned the parlor and the bathroom into a stable . You 'd think he was a horse and wanted to pass his water wherever he was , just the way a horse does on the street . " " Mother ! " Dorothy exclaimed , shocked . This almost sickened Dorothy . She suddenly remembered that Joe had often said her old man ought to leave that old lady of hers , and that if the old lady kicked off first , her father could always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . You know how hard I worked bringing up you children . " Dorothy was puzzled . She just could not understand how her mother could say any such thing . Afterp102all , she remembered very well how her mother had always nagged and bawled out her father , and given him so little peace , and she remembered , too , many times her father had been kind and had brought home presents and candy for her mother , as well as for Jack and herself . Her father had been very good to all of them . Her mother was just not telling the truth . This pained her . She felt sorry , too , very sorry , to think that her mother got things so twisted up . And she suddenly realized that Mother had always been this way ; she had always had a chip on her shoulder and been too nervous and too inclined to feel sorry for herself , and to expect too much from Father and from others . She just wished that there were something she could say or do . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wished she could only help to make things easier here for her father , and , yes , for her mother , too . " How can a woman live with a man like that ? " Peg asked in a very sad voice . Dorothy recalled that her mother had once asked the same question about herself and Joe . " Mother , a wife has to be sensible . A man has to blow off steam . I know that . Because I know Joe . Joe has got to blow off steam , and so when he does I let him . I get him the beer and I let him drink it . Then he goes to bed , and the next day he feels a littlesorry , and he is even kinder than usual to me and to the children . "  | " Yes , Joe is wonderful , Dorothy ; you have a wonderfulhusband , " Peg said . " Just let Father drink his beer now and then and go to bed and sleep it off . Father never did anyone any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times . All men like a little babying . " " Dorothy , I do nothing else . I have to baby him all the time . You do n't know your father any more . He 's a grouchy old man now . You say those things because I . . . I brought you up to love him . I was on my knees until they were red and raw , I was on my knees until they ached , scrubbing the bathroom floor . " Dorothy was too deeply hurt and saddened to answerher mother . If she were alone now , she would cry . And she was afraid there was no use trying to talk sensibly to her mother . " No , your father 's not well . He 's not well . I do my best to take care of him . I always did my best . Does he care ? Does he appreciate it ? " " What 's the matter with Father ? " Dorothy asked in alarm . Peg 's eyes changed . A sudden light of understandingcame into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and staying up late , drinking the way he did last night , and than having to get up at the crack of dawn is n't good for a man . But it 's not my fault . " " But , Mother , is there anything wrong with Fa-ther ? "  | " He coughed last night in his sleep . What with his coughing and snoring , I did n't get a wink of sleep myself . " " Then you should rest today , Mother . " " Who 's going to clean up your father 's mess if I lie in bed all day ? " " Oh , Mother , please be sensible , " Dorothy said . Her sense of alarm about her father 's health was gone . She decided that her mother had been exaggeratingagain and just getting things wrong . " You can talk after I raised you ! You do n't have to live with him ! You can talk , Dorothy . Because you do n't know . You 'll never know . You 'll never know the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , you expect too much of Father . He was a hard-working man . He still is . He kept one job with the same company for years . My goodness , Mother , what can you expect of a man ? " " You do n't know your father as I do , " Peg said with finality . Then , after a pause , and with strain in her voice , she added , " You 'll never know your father as I have known him . " Dorothy restrained her anger . Peg seemed to sense that she might have said too much . She had said many things to Dorothy about what a brute Dorothy 's husband , Joe , was , and this had caused trouble between her and her daughter , and now she very much wanted Dorothy on her side against Walt . Her children were all she had left inp105the world to live for , her children and her grandchil-dren . " Come , Dorothy , let me make you a cup of tea . " " Oh , do n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . I was just going to make myselfsome anyway , " Peg said sweetly . Dorothy nodded her head . She felt just hopelessly sad about Mother . Walt sat at the counter of the crowded , noisy restaurant , having a bowl of chicken soup . On most days he did n't go out for lunch at all but just sent over for sandwiches and coffee and went right on working . He used to bring his lunch , but Peg had made so much fuss about making it that he stopped taking it so he ' would n't have to hear her talk about it . But ' on his lunch hour did he have to think of that ? He had come here just to get away from the Depot and to , pass the time , hoping this would fortify him for the rest of the day . The soup was just what he needed . When he 'd first looked at the steaming bowl , he had n't wanted to touch it . But the first spoonful felt good , and now he was lapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Catching the eye of the counterman , he said : " Good soup . "  |p106The  counterman frowned . Walt asked himself what that poor guy 's trouble was . There were a number of express drivers in the restaurant , and they and the other customers were talkingand laughing , and the place was very gay . Down the counter from him , one young driver , Dick Tappins , was saying : " Yes , and so the poor sonofabitch is putting all that dough into insurance so his wife will be provided for if he kicks the bucket . We was having beers at the tavern where I go , out my way , and he was telling us . Hell , he 's been telling us this story so damned many times I know what he 's going to say by heart , once he says something about his insurance . So I says to him , I says , Listen , you 'll do without things , break your back working , and then you 'll croak and your wife will be picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that bum will get all the fruits of your labor . ' " Dick Tappins let out a healthy laugh . A couple of drivers beside him laughed with him . Walt grinned and went on drinking his soup . He remembered how he often had laughed like that . He did n't seem to laugh as much nowadays . He guessed that as you started to get on in years , maybe you just lost the ability to laugh as much . But , hell , had n't he been a young fellow once like Dick Tappins , full of beans and energy ? He never thought his life could turn out to be the kind of a life it was . But , then , no life ever did . Only he never thought that thingsp107would be the way they were with himself and Peg . It made you sad . There was more loud talk and laughter . He caught snatches of it and smiled at some of the jokes he overheard . He wanted to swing around on the stool and holler out some jokes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once there had n't been a man in the Express Company who liked a joke better than he . Hell , today the jokes just were n't in him . He felt very lonely in the gay restaurant . Walt was making a determined effort to eat a hot roast-beef sandwich with gravy and mashed potatoes . When you had a hangover , you had to get some food in you and pick up your energy and spirits . He was relieved about one thing , too . Physically , he must be pretty much okay , because he had gotten through the morning , he was putting away a good lunch , and he was starting to feel as if maybe he might be up to par . When Walt saw Stratton , a driver , take a seat beside him , his spirits dropped . Stratton was a decent enough fellow , and did his work well and minded his own business , only he was such a depressed fellow that you did n't want him around . Stratton was small and thin , and he looked har/assed and weazened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair had already begun to grow gray at the temples . " Hello , Mr. Callahan , " Stratton said spiritlessly . " Why , hello , Stratton . Who you workin ' for these days ? " " Mr. Moylan . " " Well , old Troubles himself . He 's still going strong . And how 's tricks with you , young fellow ? " " You 'll never get rich with a family . " " Yes , you 've got a big family . Well , you 'll have supportwhen you grow old . " " My wife 's pregnant again . " " Boy , you never stop . What will this make ? " " Seven . " " And you only making a driver 's salary . I should think you 'd call it a day as far as populatin ' the world goes , Stratton . " " My wife wo n't let me . " " Wo n't let you what ? " " Wo n't let me stop . " Walt laughed . " You got a gal who likes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's against her religion to let me do anything . You 're a Catholic , are n't you , Mr. Callahan ? " " Yes , of course I am . " " Does the Church demand it that way ? " " Well , I 'll tell you , Stratton , I ai n't up much on my catechism , but I stopped and took precautions . "  |p109Stratton  stared at Walt in disbelief . " And your wife let you ? " " Sure , she did , " Walt said breezily . " Gee , your wife must be different from mine , Stratton said . Walt was touched . He was n't the only man in the world who got a rough going from his old lady , he thought to himself . Stratton must have it worse than he did . Look at the poor lad , washed out , dried up , looking as if there was n't any spirit left in him , and he was n't forty yet . " Flow is the wife ? " Walt asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came home from work the other night and the house was dirty and the kids were hungry and crying , and my supper was n't ready . I asked my wife what was the matter She said to me that God had n't told her that day to take care of the kids and cook their supper and my supper . She keeps telling me what God tells her to do and what God does n't tell her to do . " Stratton 's voice sounded hopeless . He talked like a bewildered man . Walt , listening to him , was sur-prised . He did n't like to believe the thought that had come to him as Stratton went on talking about his wife . This poor loogin Stratton must have a crazy wife . God , Peg was n't that bad . No , Peg was n't like that . She knew what she was doing , and she did n't talk to God . Stratton was much worse off than he was . Walt finished his lunch . Stratton just got him down too much for Walt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . He felt sorry for the poor guy , but what could he do to help him ? Christ , what can I do to help myself ? he asked himself . " Well , it 's a tough life if you do n't weaken , " Strattonsaid . " Yes , " Walt said , getting down from the stool at the counter . " Keep your pecker up , lad , " he said sympathetically , giving Stratton a friendly pat on the shoulder . Then , as he walked away toward the cash desk to pay his check , he suddenly reflected that what Strattonhad to do , more than anything else , was not to keep his pecker up . Walt laughed at his own joke but without zest . With a toothpick between his teeth , Walt stood outside the restaurant . Little Willie Collins sidled up to him . He wore an express cap with a badge on it . His face was ruddy and his hair was graying . " Hi , Walt . " " Why , hello , Willie . Feedin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Walt for a moment . Walt knew what was coming . " Walt , when do you think they 're going to call me back ? "  | " Hell , ' Willie , I do n't know . Every year the emphasisis on more efficiency , and it looks as if they 'll keep cutting down the number of Route Inspectors and Dispatchers . " " I know , but no man who knows me does n't know that I got a rough deal . You know how good I was when I was Chief Dispatcher up in the Call Departmentin the days of Patsy McLaughlin . Why , goddamnit , none of the efficiency muckety-mucks in the Main Office ever got a thing on me . They never caught me with my pants down . " " Yes , Willie boy , I know , " Walt said mechanically . " You remember how there was n't a time you called me for a truck that I did n't pull you out of a hole and come up Johnny-on-the-spot with a truck . " Walt nodded . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be to get along with in the old days . But , hell , no use in remindingWillie . Poor Willie Collins was pathetic . God , it was years ago now since the Depression , when Willie was demoted from the Supervision , taken out of Dispatching , and put to driving a tractor under Gas-House McGinty . The two of them had always been at each other 's throats . It had been a big joke how every morning McGinty would call Willie up to his tractor board in the Wagon Department , give him a pail , and send Willie out for coffee just to humiliatehim . And for a while Casey , who at first had been Collins 's clerk , had been Collins 's boss . Casey used to send Willie out for coffee , too . Unexpectedp112things happened to a man in life working for a big : company like this one . " It was n't my fault . It was just that they did n't understand . They did n't know they made a mistake . " " And you were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Convince the muckety-mucks and big-shots ? Of course , I would n't have been bumped off my job if Patsy McLaughlin had been the boss . I was old Patsy'sace . But Patsy had already passed away  --  may the . Lord have mercy on his soul . He was the finest man I ever knew , and I ai n't ashamed to say that I cried when old Patsy died . " There was a catch in Walt 's throat . He recalled how he 'd damned near cried himself when he 'd heard the news about Patsy 's death . Patsy had been like a father to all of them , and working had never been quite the same since Patsy had passed on . Walt felt close to Willie . They had talked and fought on the telephone in the old days . They 'd both started on the wagons , and he guessed they were just old teamsters living in this new world of trucks and tractorsand airplanes and even air express . Seeing Willie brought back these days of his life that were gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then as he did now . And yet those days seemed better , more in-teresting , than these . Yes , he 'd been younger then , and he 'd hoped for lots of things . And Willie , a poor clown , hoping that he 'd be promoted back to his old . job . But , still , he felt close to Willie . He was sad , sadp113for the days that were gone and never would come again , and for hopes and dreams that were gone with those days . " Walt , put in a good word for me with Joe Leonardand Hiram Wolfe . They 'll listen to the word of a man like you , Walt . You 're an old-timer , you 've been in this game for a long time , and they know you know your stuff . " " Well , any time I can do anything for you , Willie , you know I 'll do it , " Walt said sympathetically . " You were always white , Walt , you always were a white man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both laughing at and feeling sorry for Willie . Hell , he knew , and many others in the Company did , too , that Willie could never get back to his old job . The Company just did n't want Willie dispatching or as a Route Inspector . That was the long and the short of it . " You know , Walt , I do n't gripe . I only say that they made a mistake . So here I am , goddamn it , for over fifteen years , for nearly twenty years , driving a tractor , when I should have been doin ' somethin ' better . Goddamn it , I was an ace , an ace when I was the Chief Dispatcher up in the Call Department . Walt wanted to get away from Willie . Hell , this guy Collins would only give him the blues , put him in the dumps . He began to edge away from him to the curb . Willie grabbed his coat and continued : " Walt , you know , it was n't fair what they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bump some of the Inspectors and Dispatchers . Some of them should have been bumped . They were n't fellowslike you and me , with their eyes on the ball , aces . They were just little deuces , that 's all . Walt , I tell you , it was n't fair to do it to me . " Walt nodded . He did n't know what to say to Willie , and Willie was always singing the blues this way every time he could buttonhole anyone to listen to him . Yes , he was sorry for the guy , but what could he do about it ? And , hell , who was or who was n't a Dispatcher did n't seem to make too damned much difference to the Company . He had no illusions about that . They could shove him back on the wagons , just as they had shoved Willie Collins back there in the Depression , and the Company would go right on , and somebody else would do the Dispatching . That was the way it was when a man worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , he guessed , driving a. horse and wagon as he 'd been Dispatching . So , what the hell ! " Do you think they 'll call me back , Walt ? " Willie asked . " God , I ca n't say , Willie . But I sure hope they do . " " Have you ate yet , Walt ? " " Yes , I 'm just going back to work now . " " I 'm feedin ' . " Willie shook hands with Walt . They parted . Walt was glad to be shed of Willie Collins . The guy was pathetic.  |p115He  wondered what Willie 's wife was like . What had Mrs. Collins said to Willie years ago when Willie was bumped from the Supervision ? Had she nagged him about it all these years ? Did Willie leave a happy home for work every morning ? Because if he did , did it matter one snowball in hell if he drove a tractor or if he was in the Supervision ? " Hi , Mr. Callahan , " a driver called . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile and a wave of the hand . Now it was back to the job . Peg 's housework was done . She had nothing more to do but shop . Dorothy had gone . She sat thinking about Dorothy.  --  It must be so . It must be so , she told herself in a tense mood . She decided that it was so . Walt had gone to Dorothyand Joe and talked against her , lied about her , turned them both against her . Dorothy and her brute of a husband were on Walt 's side . The way Dorothy had talked proved that . No one would believe it if they had n't seen it with their own eyes . She would n't herself if she had n't sat looking at her own daughter and listening to her right here in this very parlor only a little while ago . But she knew it was true . Walt had gotten their ear . He must have seenp116them secretly last week on that night when he 'd told her he was playing poker with some of the boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , talking like an old lady , talking against her . She rose from her chair and paced the floor , grittingher teeth as she took long strides back and forth . Lying about a mother to a child . Ah , the two of them had always been like that . They had always been too close . When Dorothy was little , they would laugh and joke and have games together , and , fool that she was with her trusting heart , it had never dawned on her that they were laughing at her . How innocent she had been ! An innocent mother , raising her family , and what was the father doing but acting like a fiend , turning his six-year-old daughter against her own mother ? No wonder Dorothy could only marry a brute like Joe Zarilla . Little wonder ! Now she saw it ! Now she knew it ! All these years he had been against her ! All these years he had been a fiend , and she , so innocent , oh , so innocent . Now the blinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in a mood of rising indignation . When Peg walked into the butcher shop , Marty , the owner , looked away and made a face . His young assistant edged toward the rear so he might escape waiting on her.  | " Marty , you 're the only honest butcher I know , " Peg said . " Why , thank you , thank you , Mrs. Callahan . I 've been in business in this neighborhood for twenty years , and I 've always believed that honesty pays . " " If you only knew the robbery that goes on  --  why is n't something done about it ? " " I do n't know . I like to mind my own business and have good relations with my customers . How 's Walt , Mrs. Callahan ? " She shook her head sadly . " He 's not feeling too well . Age , you know , Marty , age tells . " " Oh , I 'm sorry to hear it . I saw him at Mass two weeks ago , and he was looking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him something he can eat . Do you have a capon ? " " Yes , I think I 've got just what you want , Mrs. Cal-lahan . " Marty turned and nodded to his assistant to get a capon from the icebox in the rear of the shop . " Marty , you pick it out yourself . Your young man here is a fine young man , but I want to do business with you . If I have something to say to Father Kenny , I do n't go to one of his assistant priests , I go to him . You pick it out for me yourself . " " Yes , I was going to look it over , Mrs. Callahan . I 'll get it . " Marty went out to the back of the shop . Peg turned to the assistant.  | " Do n't misunderstand me , young man , I mean nothing against you when I ask Marty to give me his personal attention . " " Oh , no , Mrs. Callahan , I understand . There is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of meat like the boss here . " " I 've been coming here to Marty for years . " She laughed rather strangely . " He knows better than to sell me a tough cut of meat . " Again she laughed strangely . " He once did . Did he ever tell you about the tough cut of sirloin steak he once sold me ? " " No , ma 'm , I do n't think he did . " " Ha , he 'll never forget it , " she said , again laughingstrangely . " He 'll never again sell me steak that 's like a piece of rubber . " Marty returned carrying a capon . " Here 's a bird that is going to melt in your old man 's mouth , Mrs. Callahan , " Marty said to her . He dropped the capon on the scale . " Of course , the way I cook meat and fowl , why , you could n't eat better cooked meat in the best hotelsof Chicago . " " I 'm sure of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has commented to me more than once on your cooking when he 's been in here buying meat or when I 've run into him on the street or at Mass . " " At home , he takes my cooking for granted . Marty , do you take your wife for granted ? " " That 's one thing I better not do , Mrs. Callahan , " Marty said as he cast a professional eye at the scale.  | " I 'd forgive you for that , Marty , " she said . " Now , about this capon , Mrs. Callahan , " Marty began . She lost interest and said : " I 'll take it . " How the afternoon had dragged ! And during these last hours he 'd gotten to feeling more and more pooped out . He 'd think of Peg , too , when his mind was n't on his work , and he 'd wonder what her mood would be when he got home  --  would she be sore , would she nag him , would she be in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink some beer , too much beer , that was all , and why should she make so goddamn much of it ? Hell , when he only did things that other men did he got hell from her , and she sometimes would n't let up , and , hell , it was n't fair to him , it just was n't fair . And what added to his worry was just the prospect of going home and having Peg sit right on his tail . Now , if he could feel sure he was going home to have some peace and could just pitch into bed and sleep , wake up and eat , and just do nothing but have a peaceful night , then it would be different . But , God , Peg treated him almost like he was a sonofabitch , and , hell , he knew he had his faults , but , after all , how was he a sonofabitch ? It had been a tiring afternoon at work , but now itp120was over and he could go home . Go home to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mind would be in a kind of fog , and he did n't want to think about anything . When he hit the street , he would feel lost . He would be surprised by the daylight and particularly by the sunshine . That was the way he felt now . He wanted to do something , and he did n't know what he wanted to do . He 'd walked down here to Clark and Van Buren almost as if he had been in a trance , and he stood on the corner , blinking his eyes . He wanted something to happen to him which would maybe even change his life . He did n't know what it could be . And he was a little disappointed , because he 'd left the Depot and walked here to get his streetcar home , foolishly thinking that something would happen to him and that today would be different from every other day . It was the way he 'd felt when he was young , before he 'd met Peg , and sometimeseven after he had met her and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something could have happened . Look at what happened to fat Porky Mulroy . He wondered how Porky was , and what kind of life Porky had had since leaving the Company and his wife . The noise of traffic drummed in his ears . Funny how the noise back on the Depot platform did n't faze him , but , once out here on the street , it was different , and the noises of the automobiles and trucks and streetcars and the elevated just knocked the thoughts right out of his head . He felt kind of safe and sure ofp121himself at work , and everything seemed more interesting , and he felt he was somebody and was respectedby others , and that he was doing his job good enough , but when he left work for the day he had this lost feeling . Now it was just as if he was nobody . And at home he could n't feel that he was important either , because Peg never gave him credit for anything . Hell , she ought to give him some credit . Like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was around , and Mr. Carver called him Walt and told him he always gave full co-operation . Mr. Carver was distant most of the time and did not have much to say to those in the Wagon Department exceptwhen he had complaints and criticisms of them about getting freight off the platforms , and most of the Dispatchers bitched about Mr. Carver . But Mr. Carver had praised him and called him Walt , and they 'd had a good five-minute chat . There were storiesthat Mr. Carver was going up in the Company , and there must be something behind them , because Mr. Carver had just about as much as told him so and he 'd said , too :  --  Walt , you 're one man I wo n't forget . Hell , some day he might be promoted . That ought to impress Peg . But he did n't know . Walt 's feet still ached . His legs were tired . But he continued to stand on the corner of Clark and Van Buren streets , unable to make up his mind what to do. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he knew he could just roll right into sleep . But he did n't want to go home . And , come to think of it , he often felt much the same when he finished work . And the fine weather , it made him feel down in the mouth . This fine weather just did n't mean much to him at his age . Days like today were made for love . He turned to look at a fine-looking girl who was passing . What a damned inviting piece . But if a man of his age tried to pick her up , she 'd think he was a moron . But , God , how he 'd like to have something like that , just once more in his life . Peg had been his girl . And it had all turned out so that here he was , standing on this street corner at the age of sixty-three and not wanting to take the streetcar home . And anothergirl . Thin , but there was enough meat on her . And the legs . Golly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good legs . And the thin girl 's face . She was a beauty . Some lucky young fellow would get that girl 's beauty . But , no , it was n't just a girl , a piece of tail , he wanted . Hell , he could sneak out and go to a whorehousesome night if it was just that . Only he 'd look funny at a whorehouse , and suppose he went and could n't . Walt became aware of a young fellow , staring at him . He looked down at the sidewalk , abashed . He must be arousing suspicion standing here this way . He felt almost as if this young fellow knew his thoughts . He coughed nervously , not because he hadp123to but because he imagined the young fellow might be thinking him maybe queer , or a moron or something . Then Walt quickly crossed the street to board a streetcar and go home . Sitting next to a window on the . car , Walt realizedhow done in he was . In fact , he was too tired to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . The newspaper usually helped him forget he was going home , and it took his mind away from worrying about the mood Peg might be in . And these last days he had been worrying and thinking and remembering . He did n't know why he was doing this , because , come to think of it , Peg had always been nervous , and she was n't any different now than she 'd been before these last few days . Why did he have it more on his mind now than a month ago or a year ago ? Was something happening to him ? This question , popping into his mind this way , frightened him . He began to sweat under the armpits , and he suddenly felt weak and faint . Christ , was he having a heart attack ? His heart began to pound so that he imagined he heard it . He sat very still in the swaying , bumping car , fearfullyexpecting the pain of a violent heart at/tack . Maybe he would die right in the streetcar . Maybe the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and he was living his last minutes . He could n't think . He could n't pray . He did n't know what to do . He felt far away from the people on the car , as if he were half out of this world , or out of it and all by himself . Was it coming ? He could n't just sit here and wait . But there was nothing he could do . The car rocked on , jerked to a stop . A few people got off . It started . The stores on the street . People on the street going about their business . He sighed , telling himself that he did n't want to die . He could n't hear his heart any more . The heart attack was n't coming now . It had been a false alarm , a foolish fear . This was only a result of his hangover and of being tired . But suppose it had been his time ? It would n't have been so hard to go , so long as he did n't suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or said an Act of Contrition , and with the thoughts he 'd just been having back there on the cornerof Clark and Van Buren . This Saturday he 'd go to confession . He ought to go more often from now on . A man of his age never knew when the call would come . The car swayed , rocked on , and again stopped at a corner . Hell , everybody had to die some day . He was goingto die , and there was no use in his beating hisp125brains out about it . When his time came , he would just grin and bear it and go . Only he did n't want to go ahead of his time , so maybe he ought to go and see Doc Flaherty and get a check-up , and maybe he 'd better watch his smoking and the coffee he drank . Walt slipped down a little in his seat . He 'd try and sleep . That would make him forget . Only if he did , he might pass his stop . What would Peg say if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her he 'd fallen asleep . Walt closed his eyes . When he died , what would his wake and funeral be like , and what would be said at the funeral sermon ? A good man has lived his time and gone to his Father who is above . A man who worked hard all his life , loved his neighbors and performed his Christian duties , provided for his own , and he leaves his bereavedwidow , his children and grandchildren , and he goes to the home of his Father to be judged and to . . . to what ? Walt yawned . And his wake . Would Peg be in tears , or how would she act when he died ? Would she come to see that he was n't such a bad fellow and .. . The car rocked along and stopped again . He opened his eyes , unable to fall asleep . Glancing out the window , he told himself that , gee , it was still light and sunny out , and he thought , gosh , if he 'd only worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! In those days he used to get home at six , six-thirty , or seven o'clock , often tuckered outp126from long hours of work , and by the time supper was eaten there had n't been much time to play with the kids . But now a workingman like Joe , his son-in-law , got home in daylight and did n't work the kind of hours workingmen did years ago . Joe did n't have to work as hard as he 'd worked on the wagons . He was glad of that . It was only one of the ways that things had gotten better . And F.D.R. had done it , pretty much , for the workingman . Peg got sore if he praised F.D.R. , but he did n't know why  --  F.D.R. had n't done her any harm . He shook his head quizzically . Funny , the things a woman got sore about . Peg got sore , too , if he spoke of her as a grandmother . He liked to think of himself as a grandfather . Of course , it was more understandable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it was about F.D.R. There were many things you could think of to please a woman but they did n't always please her . Like his bringing home that syphon . Often things he thought would please Peg just got her sore . Hell , going home used to seem better when the kids were young . He could n't remember too much about the kids , but he was always remembering some little thing . He used to bounce Dorothy on his knees when she was a little tot , or put her on his shoulders and give her horseback rides  --  he always called them that , but most people called them piggy-back rides  --  and he used to be Dorothy 's horse and get down on his knees , and she would drive him . And he remem/bered one Sunday morning after church , he had gotten down on his hands and knees with Johnny and Dorothy . He 'd pretended that he was a horse , and Johnny was driving him , and Dorothy was Johnny 's helper on an express wagon , and Johnny was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cord he pretendedwas a whip , and they rigged up chairs as a wagon , and the kids were getting a big kick out of playing with him . He was having fun and thinking to himself that he was giving the kids a good time , and was doing with them what a father ought to be doing with his kids on a Sunday morning , and then Peg had come in , and , Jesus , how sore she got ! God , he could n't remember all the things she 'd said , but she 'd said so damned much , screaming and shouting and saying he was spoiling the kids , and laughing at him for letting himself play horse and calling him Horsey Walt . Walt yawned . He wished the ride were over with . But , then , once it was , he had to get past Peg . He wanted to sleep , and all he hoped was that she would n't be all set to nag him and not let him . But sometimes she was different and did n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe she would be quiet and in a good humor when he got home . Remembering that Sunday morning so long ago , he still felt that Peg had n't been fair . She had n't been fair . And before it had all ended , Dorothy had been crying , and Johnny had been in a corner , kind of cowering , and he and Peg had been standing therep128in the parlor fighting and yelling and calling each other names and , God , it had just made him want to feel sick , and even remembering it now on the streetcarit almost made him feel sick . My God , come to think of it , there 'd been so many scenes and quarrelsfor years , and so many times that he 'd come home from work not wanting to and feeling kind of nervous for fear that Peg would be riding on her high horse . Letting himself in by the front door , Walt felt apprehensive . Now maybe he 'd have to face the music . But , damn it , he 'd gone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Hello ! " he called , trying to sound cheerful . There was no answer . He made a face . This was n't a promising sign . He started toward the back of the apartment . Peg came out of the kitchen . " Oh , I did n't hear you come in . " " I called as I came in . " " I did n't hear you . " " Well , how are you , Peg ? " " Oh , I 'm tired . I had to clean the house and shop , and I 'm cooking you a supper with everything you like . I thought you 'd need a good meal . "  | " Gee , thanks , Peg , " he said , drawing her to him and kissing her cheek . She was unresponsive . " I bought a capon . I picked it out myself . " " I know it 's going to be good , Peg . " He was grateful to her for not being belligerent . " I 'm tired . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get on the bed in your dirty work clothes . I ca n't wash sheets all the time , and the laundries are getting dearer every day , and I have n't found one yet that does n't lose things or ruin what they do send back . " " I wo n't , Peg , " he said . He quickly went to the bedroom , took off his clothes , and dropped onto the bed . He did n't have to worry about anything . He could sleep until suppertime . His hour or so of sleep had been so sweet . Yes , sweet . And then he 'd taken a hot bath , put on clean clothes , and now it was just as if he had n't drunk all that beef and had a hangover today . He was tired , but it was a kind of pleasant tiredness . He had on clean underwear , clean socks , a freshly pressed pair of pants , and a clean white shirt . He left it open at the collar . And he was shaved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That scare on the streetcar had only beenp130a foolish worry . Maybe his time was still far off . After all , if he was n't healthy , and if he was n't in fair shape , and if his old ticker was n't ticking in pretty good order , why , then , he would n't have been able to get through the day as well as he had , would he ? But he just wanted to forget last night . After all , all he 'd done was to drink too much beer . The smell of food seemed to whet his appetite . And there was the bird , nicely cooked , and the potatoes , the salad , the bowl of gravy . It was a real spread , and he was grateful to Peg for it , and for havinggone to all this trouble for him . " Gee , this is swell , Peg , " he said , gazing at the tableand sniffing . " I hope you appreciate it and realize how hard it was getting this supper ready for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said earnestly . " The food 's getting cold . Carve the capon before your meal is cold . After all the work I did cooking it for you , do you want a cold meal ? " " It wo n't get cold , " he said . He picked up the carving knife and fork . He liked to carve and was proud of how well he usually did it , but Peg never gave him credit for his skill . He began to cut up the capon neatly and with a feeling of real pleasure . " Ca n't you carve any faster than that ? I do n't want to eat a cold meal , " Peg said curtly . " A man ca n't look at a fowl and have it carved . I 'm carving . "  |p131Do  n't carve too much . " " I wo n't , " Walt said , sinking the knife in beside the left leg . " It 's always the same  --  I try my hardest to fix you a nice dinner and to have everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't even care . Dorothy is just the same . She does n't care if she serves warm or cold food . " " It wo n't be cold . Go ahead and serve , and I 'll have the bird carved in a jiffy . " In a moment he looked up with pride and said : " There , it 's all done , and the food is n't cold . " " It would be if I had n't made you hurry . You'dstill be carving . " " You might tell me you like the supper I cooked you , " she said . Walt was eating with real appetite . He looked up , and then , when he 'd swallowed what he 'd been chewing , he said , smiling : " I do . I like it . " " You would n't have told me if I had n't asked . " " But , Peg , I did tell you . I told you I liked it at least four times . " " You did n't . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he could n't understand why she should deny such a simple fact.  | " Do you like the dressing ? " " I sure do . I 've been stuffing myself with it , I like it so much . . . Peg , you 're a dandy cook  --  and a fine wife . " She gazed stonily down at her own plate , picked up her fork , and went on eating . Watching Walt eat with gusto , Peg kept thinking that he swallowed his food like a pig . He was so disgustingat the table that it was hard , very hard , a trial and a tribulation , for her to have to eat with him . He was n't a man because he was n't a human being . He was an animal . How could a woman eat when , night after night , she had to sit at the table opposite an animal like him . Just look at him slobber ! Oh , she was deserving of pity . There was nothing , just nothing she could do , because here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal who looked like a human being and a man but who could n't be called a human being or a man , and there was no use , no use whatever , in even telling him how she felt . He could n't understand . There was a morose expression on her face . She ate slowly . Now and then she glanced up from her plate to see him pushing food into his mouth . She saw how satisfied he was , and thought that his face just lookedp133stupid . Why , it was almost enough to make her want to scream , to get up and run out of the house and go away and never see him again , to make her want to rush to the bathroom and chuck up her food . And she sweated over a hot stove to cook this meal for him . She had gone out to buy the food , full of the best intentions . The care and love and thought she had given to picking out the capon at Marty 's . And before doing this she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees and scrubbing the bathroom floor . And what for ? For him to come home and eat like an animal ? " Peg , if some of them fellows down at the Express Company knew how good a cook my wife was , they 'd just look at me green with envy , green-eyed with envy , " Walt said sincerely . " Are you finished ? " she asked coldly . " Yeh , just about , " he answered , somewhat disappointedthat she did n't react to his praise . " And it was a damned swell dinner , Peg . " " It could have been better . I put too much sage in the dressing . " " Oh , I liked it just as it was . " " I 'm glad that at last I cooked something you liked . " " I always liked your cooking , Peg . " Now she seemed in a better mood . She went on eating , finishing what was on her plate . He sat back , contented and full . He would have his coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p134and  then , a little later , he would go to bed , get himself a good long night 's sleep , and he 'd be feeling tiptop in the morning . But should he tonight ? After all , he was still a man , and , goddamn it , he was proud to think that the old juices were n't dried up in him yet . He tried to observe Peg carefully without making her aware of it . God , he and Peg had been doing it for years and years , almost thirty years now . How many times had they ? " If you 've finished , I 'll get you your coffee . And I bought apple pie . I was going to bake a pie , but I just could n't with the shopping and the housework I have to do , getting down on my knees and scrubbingfloors , and you 'll just have to put up with the pie I bought at Condon 's Bakery . " " That 's perfectly okay , Peg , " he said . " This supper has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's saying a mouthful . But it is n't as much of a mouthful as the supper was , " he said , laughing at his pun . " I hope that syphon works . I put some cream in it. , , " Oh , it 'll work , all right . " " How do you know it will ? " " I just do . " " It did n't work for you . " She pointed to the wall on her right . " The wall is still stained from the last time you used it . " " That was an accident , Peg . I must have just pressed too hard . It worked for you . "  | " Yes , I worked it , " she said triumphantly . She got up , picked up both their plates , and went to the kitchen . He had been on the verge of telling her that he thought he had better skip dessert because he was so full , but he decided he 'd better not , since she had gotten him the pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked . Apple pie was one of his favorites . She might get antagonistic if he did n't have dessert now . And he did n't want tonight spoiled , especially after this supper . He tapped his knuckles lightly on the table ; they 'd gotten through supper so far without any fighting . " It 'll take another minute for the coffee to percolate . When you make coffee in the morning , it 's too weak . I have to make fresh coffee for myself every morning . " " I 'll try to let it perk longer in the mornin ' , Peg . I guess I get too impatient . I 'm sorry . " Peg started clearing away more dishes . He half rose and said : " Let me help you , Peg . " " You would n't know where to put them , you 'd make me twice as much work . " He sat back in his chair . He 'd rather sit here than clear the dishes , and , then , he 'd done his day 's work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard or harder in his life than she had here in the house . A man who worked and provided had a right to sit back/35p136and wait for his coffee and let his meal digest and let his wife clear away the dishes and wash them . That was division of labor . Hell , he told himself , he was n't asking too much just to sit here in peace , have his coffee , and feel .. . well , feel relaxed and content and not to have little things bothering him and weighing on his mind . " Say , that looks swell , " Walt said when Peg carried in a tray with the cups of coffee and pieces of apple pie with whipped cream on them . " It 's the best I could do , " she answered , setting down the tray and serving the coffee and pie . " It 's good enough for me . And say . . . " His voice became enthusiastic . " Say , the syphon worked , did n't it ? " " I made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table at her , puzzled . " Did I squirt any whipped cream in my eyes or on my hair and my face ? " " Why , no , " he said seriously . Then he felt foolish . Was she pulling his leg or was she trying to fight with him. ? " I squirted it carefully . Before you use it again , I 'll give you a lesson on how to make it squirt . " " Oh , I know how to use it now , Peg . "  | " Well , if you want to squirt whipped cream and root beer all over the walls and the floor  --  you 're the man of the house , not me . " " Peg , I only meant  --  " " Go ahead , eat your pie and drink your coffee before it gets cold . " He gave her a hangdog look And then he resolutelyset to eating his pie . He had to get it eaten , or she might go off the handle . And he did n't want that to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his stomach did n't make noises , because she could hear it and might call it to his attention or make fun of him . They were both silent for several moments . The silence made him uneasy . He felt a need to talk . " Oh , I almost forgot to tell you , Peg . " " You never tell me much anyway . " " There 's never a lot to tell , and sometimes when I do try to tell you about some incident that happened at the Depot , or something funny that someonesaid , you do n't always seem to want to listen to me . " " I always listen . You do n't listen to me . " He wanted to tell her of how , five or six nights ago , he 'd begun to tell a story about Mr. Tuttle but she had n't listened . He checked himself . No use remindingher that she had been in the wrong . " Well , what 's the story you were going to tell me ? " she asked rather curtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember what it was he 'd wanted to tell her and became uneasy about it . " Is it so important that you ca n't even remember it ? Maybe you should tie another piece of string on your finger . " " I saw Mr. Carver today . " " Who 's he ? " " He 's Superintendent of Terminals . " " You saw the Superintendent of Terminals ? You work in a terminal and you see the Superintendent of Terminals ? " she commented scornfully . " I did n't tell you yet . " " Well , I 've been waiting for ten minutes for you to tell me . It better be something good . " " But you would n't let me tell you , Peg . " " I suppose I held a knife over you and told you I 'd kill you if you told me about Mr. Carver , the Superintendentof Wagons . " " It 's Mr. Carver , and he 's Superintendent of Terminals , not wagons . " " Well , then , terminals . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when I 've been sitting here just waiting for you to tell me whatever it is you 're trying to tell me ? " " It might be important  --  for both of us . " " Then , for God 's sake , tell me what it is . " " Well , he called me Walt , for one thing . " " Is that what you took so much time to tell me ? " " He does n't call any other fellow in the Super/vision or the Wagon Department by their first name . " " So he calls you Walt , " she said . " It 's not just that he called me Walt . That 's  --  that 's like , well , it 's like a symptom . " " Ca n't you get to the point of whatever it is you are trying to tell me ? " " That 's what I 'm trying to do . He was friendly and stopped to talk with me for about five minutes . " " I thought you worked so hard you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's an important man in the Company , and there are stories going around that he 's going up the ladder , and that 's the point of what I 'm trying to tell you  --  " " Well , tell it to me then , " she interrupted . " I am , if you 'll let me . " " You 've been talking until my coffee got cold and you have n't told me the story yet , " she said with an ironical laugh . " Well , he said he would n't forget me . That means maybe if he does go up , well , some day he 'll promote me . " " He better hurry up . You 're sixty-three already . " " I do n't have to go on my pension until I 'm seventy . " " And so if you do n't grow too old too soon , you might be promoted . " Walt silently finished his pie and coffee . He was too deeply wounded to speak.  |p140Walt  shook his head sleepily from side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a big , noisy yawn . He was glad Peg had told him not to bother about helping her do the dishes . But she could n't say he had n't offered to help , because he had . He picked up the newspaper , looked at it , held it in his hand , but he just did n't have the energy or the interest to read it . He heard his stomach making rolling , digestive noises , and he belched . He was glad Peg was n't in the room to hear . He patted his stomach . He had something of a paunch , not too much , but something . But then , hell , look at Casey . Casey was younger than he was , a damned sight younger than he was . His stomach had stopped making noises now . He slumped slightly in his chair . He let out another yawn . He felt kind of peaceful at last . And that conversation today with Mr. Carver . Suppose Mr. Carver became General Manager and should make him an Assistant Superintendent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game well enough now after all these years . He 'd gone on the wagons as a helper when he 'd only been a kid of seventeen . Next year would make it fifty years in the express business . Almost half a century of work  --  now , that was a record to be proud of and it ought to be ap/preciated . And he could handle a bigger job . He knew he could . Golly , he could just see himself as an Assistant Super , coming around to his old Depot , seeing that goddamned cantankerous foreman , Mr. Tuttle . And having a desk and sitting there and dictatingletters . How would he be at that ? He hardly wrote ten letters a year , but as an Assistant Super he 'd have to dictate letters , and he did n't know how good he 'd be at that . But that would n't be any obstacle . And maybe he 'd come up with a lot of ideas to make things run better , only he would n't go in none for this damned efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could see himself going around to his Depots in a car , checking up and knowing he was liked . Hell , plenty of fellows would be glad if he did become an Assistant Super , and they 'd sincerely congratulate him . And , then , the money . Four-ninety a month . He 'd get one hundred and fifty dollars more a month , and with that he could get a house for Peg and himself . They should have bought one years ago , and if they had , it would be all paid for now . Heinie Mueller owned his own house , and , besides saving money , he got a lot of pleasure out of it . But Peg had been dead set against it . Funny , but she was always dead set against anythingnew or a change . She 'd even been against that syphon . Then , too , his pension would be bigger if he becamean Assistant Super , and he could really live on it when he retired and not have to take another job.  |p142But  maybe he was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not become General Manager . Still , why could n't he be an AssistantSuper ? He sank lower in his chair and yawned again . From the kitchen he heard Peg washing the dishes . He was waiting for her to finish and come in , hoping she would n't be hostile or antagonistic . He nodded his head and continued to sit in a kind of pleasant and soothing stupor . Peg had said something , but he had n't quite heard her right away , because he was just sitting here , just sitting almost as if he was away outside of the world and was someplace else , off all by himself . Then he looked across the parlor at Peg . " I do n't mind it , dear , " she said in an icily sweet voice . " Oh , dear , I was half asleep . " " You always act this way and do n't pay much attention to me , but I 'm used to it . I only asked if you enjoyed your dinner . " " Yes , Peg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal . " He sank back a little in his chair . He did n't want to talk now . He could n't think of anything to say . God , even if he were with an assemblage of the big shots of the Company now , he could n't get up any interest . That was the way he felt.  |p143But  he felt that he had to say something to Peg . She wanted to talk , and if he did n't talk with her and show some interest , she 'd get sore . He knew that it got lonely enough for her , and she did n't have anybody to talk to all day , and he knew that at night a man and his wife who were alone together and gettingold should talk to each other and be sociable , but , God , what could he talk about right now ? It was just as if there was n't any talk in him . He felt that way . Tired-like . Peaceful and tired-like . If they could just sit here , and each of them think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were together , and not have to say anything . . . if they could be like that . But they could n't . Because that was n't the way it was . And , my God , after all these years , he still did n't know how to talk to her so as not to get her dander up . " You 're tired ? " Peg asked . " Yes , I am . I 'm kind of sleepy . I thought I would just sit here a while and think and maybe look at my paper and turn in and hit the hay early . " " Let me get you a glass of beer . It will relax you and make you sleep better . " " No , no , thanks , Peg , I do n't think I ought to drink any beer . " " Well , I 'll get it for you to relax you . " " Gosh , I 'm relaxed , " Walt said . Peg was sitting on the edge of her chair , tapping her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position in little ways , clasping and unclasping herp144hands , looking down at her hands and legs , glancing at him and all around the room .. She seemed mighty nervous and jittery to him . It was she , not he , who was n't relaxed . " Well , I offered to get it for you . I try to take care of you and do for you the things a wife ought to do . " " Yes , I know you do . And , Peg , I do appreciate it , and I appreciate the feed you put on for me tonight . It was tops . Tops . " " Dorothy said I do n't take good enough care of you . " His eyes opened wide . He sat up . " When did she say that ? " " Today . " " What did she do , phone you ? How are she and Joe and the kids ? " " I told you she was here to see me . " " No , you did n't . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here , but you just never listen to me . " But she had n't told him . He 'd remember it if she had . " It does n't matter . Even if it was something important I told you , it would be the same  --  you would n't hear me , " Peg said disconsolately . " But you did n't tell me , dear . How is Dorothy ? " " I never expected the day would come when you would lie to my face , Walt Callahan . " Walt opened his mouth to speak , but he did n't . What the hell difference did it make if she had orp145had n't told him ? It was n't worth fighting and quarreling about . " I 'm sorry , dear . I guess I just was n't listening , or I must have forgotten that you told me Dorothy was over to see you today . " " She talked as if you might have been talking to her against me , complaining against me and running me down . I never ran you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But , Peg , I ai n't talked to Dorothy since that night she telephoned . Remember , Peg ? You heard everything I said . It was the night I brought home the Little Gem Syphon . And , Peg , why should I want to talk against you to Dorothy ? " " I do n't know , " she said dully . " But it does n't matter . " " Honest , Peg . . . " he began . But he did n't go on , because she looked as if she was n't listening . They both sat silent now . Walt could see that she was very sad and depressed . And when she was like this , it got him , too . He was beginning to feel almost as if it were his fault that Peg felt this way . But what had he done to her ? " Are you sure you do n't want a glass of beer to relaxyour nerves ? " He was tempted . Maybe it would make him feel better and less gloomy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough beer last night . " Thanks , dear , not tonight . "  | " Do n't say I did n't offer to get it for you , and do n't go telephoning Dorothy complaining that I do n't take care of you and wait on you hand and foot . " " But , dear , I never did that . " She said nothing more . She seemed very much on edge now , and the two of them sat in gloomy silence . In his dream he 'd heard loud voices and noises , and then there had been a huge lion that looked as much like a cat as it did like a lion , and it had been coming at him , roaring , and then , just as he was afraid , terriblyafraid , he 'd waked up , and found that Peg had turned on the electric light and had really waked him . up shouting at him . He was bewildered . " Is anything the matter , Peg ? " he asked , blinking his eyes because of the light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The look on her face was enough to give a man the creeps . " He asks me if anything is the matter ? " she proclaimedin a loud , rasping voice . " Well , is there ? " " If there was , could I depend on you ? Could I count on you ? It 's a good thing for me that there is n't anything the matter . " " Then what the hell did you wake me up for ? "  | " As if you did n't wake me up last night , snoring like a bull and wallowing all over the bed . " " I did n't know what I was doing , and I did n't wake you up on purpose , " he countered . " That 's it , scream at me , shout ! Bully me at all hours of the day and night , just as if I was a dirty , low-down chauffeur working for you . " " But you 're doing the shouting and screaming , not me . " " Abuse me ! Lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're glaring at me and foaming out of the mouth like a man from the booby hatch , the booby hatch , the booby hatch , the booby hatch . " " What the hell are you talkin ' about ? " " What am I talking about ? Tomorrow morning , go to work and tell the expressmen that your wife picks on you  --  you , a big hulk of a man  --  picked on . " " Peg , I want to go to sleep . " " Who 's stopping you ? " " You are . You woke me up , and you wo n't stop talkin ' and shoutin ' at me and fightin ' with me . I do n't want to fight with you . I want to sleep . I got to get up early in the mornin ' and go to work . You know that . " " You 're keeping me awake . Everybody in the block can hear you shouting insults at me . You might just as well beat me , beat me to a pulp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He clenched his fist under the blanket , but then he immediately unclenched it . God , was he nuts ? Shep148was shouting and screaming . She was fighting and she was denying that she had waked him . God , he could n't understand Peg . He could n't understand women . He turned his head away from her and said : " I 'm goin ' to sleep . Good night . " " Oh , that God would only see your cruelty , " she declaimed in a throbbing , disturbed voice . Walt determined not to answer her . He remembered that she had done things like this to him before . Yes , sometimes she just got into some kind of a goddamn state like this and just kept on going and would n't stop . " He wounds me in the heart . He pierces me in the heart , and he might as well shoot an arrow or stick a knife into my heart , and then he sleeps in peace . Oh , God , that I am married to such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can live ! " she declaimed , her voice still throbbing and disturbed . Maybe if he counted sheep he would n't hear her and could go to sleep . One , two , three . . . . One sheep ... two sheep . . . three sheep . . . . Baa , baa , little black sheep . . . one . . . one sheep , two sheep , three sheep . . . four sheep .. . " How could I have known I was marrying a man without a heart ? " No , he could n't count sheep . He could n't keep his mind on it . He was tired . If he did n't get his sleep , he 'd be all done in in the morning . Could n't he shut her up ?  |p149But  now she was quiet . Maybe the storm was over . He 'd pretend he was asleep . He almost snored . But she might start up again criticizing him for snoring , and that would get under his skin . No , he would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was quiet . He wanted to sigh with relief , but he restrained himself and tried to be as still as he possibly could . He wanted her to think he was sound asleep . He was aware of his own breathing . It seemed to him that he was breathing very loudly . He decided that Peg had toned down and that she 'd come to bed and go to sleep . Now all he had to do was to get to sleep himself . Hell , he felt that never in his whole life had he wanted to sleep as much as he did now . He began to doze off . Suddenly there was a loud banging of a dresser drawer . He sat up with a start . " Goddamn you , what the hell are you doing ? " She turned on him and gave him a look he never could remember having seen on her face before . She slowly came closer to the bed , with that look on her face , her eyes kind of shining and staring straight at him almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips pressed together . And as she came closer , her face was damp and perspiring , and her hair was mussed up and wild-looking . He was afraid . Never , as long as they had been married , had she seemed or looked like this . He waited , all jittery inside . She stood over the bed ap150moment . Then , in a voice that was n't at all like her usual one , but was flat , she said to him : " Do n't fight me . Kiss me . " She bent down . He kissed her damp cheek . He was shaky . She turned away , and with her back to him began to take off her underwear . He dropped his head back on the pillow and his shoulders sagged , and , still afraid , not knowing exactly how he was feeling , and thinking he kind of felt as if he had just had a narrowescape from being run over and killed by an automobile , he lay back and watched her put on her nightgown over her thin body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into bed . Then in a meek , low voice , she said : " Good night , Walt . " " Good night , Peg . " With her kimono open , Peg sat in Walt 's chair in the darkened parlor and stared at the night through the window . She could n't sleep . Just as she 'd been going off , he 'd begun to snore . His loud snores had waked her , and now here she was , all alone in the night , waiting for the morning , waiting for him to get out of the house . Oh , would the morning never come ? She wanted to see it light out . She wanted to seep151the sunshine . There was no sunshine in her heart . There had never , never been sunshine in her life . There he was , snoring again . No man on earth , no man could make as much noise in his sleep and snore like Walt Callahan . But he had never been a man . He was old and gray and ugly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got sick and weak . It was ugly , just ugly to think of it . And he was ugly . And he had done everything he could to make her life ugly . Fool , innocent fool that she was , she had thought he would give her comfort and understanding . That was why she had given herself to him , to get comfort . He 'd been big and handsome , and he had looked strong , and her mother had just drummed it into her , day and night , day and night , that she had to get married . Her mother 's words had beat in her head , beat , beat like . . . like what ? Like Walt Callahan 's snores . There he was , snoring again . You could hear him snore in every room , every corner of the house . God , she 'd bet even the neighbors could hear him snore , the way the neighbors had used to hear her mother screaming at her and shouting and nagging , telling her to get married . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father ? Peg cried softly . Her mother had killed her father . It was because of her mother that he 'd drunk . Nothinghad stopped her mother , and now , now she couldp152understand how her father had been driven to drink , and how he never would have had that accident and died if her mother had not driven him to it . Oh , would the morning never come ? There he was , snoring away . Some day she would go out of her mind because of him and his snoring . If she had to go on like this night after night , not able to sleep because of him , she could . . . she could . . . A terrible fear contorted her , and she curled up on the chair and trembled . And she remembered how one night as a little girl she could n't sleep , and she had been afraid and gotten out of bed and run towardher mother 's bedroom . The door was open . She 'd heard them and seen them in the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd thought her father was beating her mother . She 'd run back to bed , trembling and whimpering . And she 'd felt all alone , alone and unloved and afraid . She 'd wanted to die . She 'd been afraid she would die , and she 'd wanted to die , and she 'd been too afraid to cry for fear they 'd hear her and that her father would come in and hurt her . And she 'd heard him coming , his heavy walk . Step by step , and he 'd come into the bedroom . She had lain perfectly still and pretended to be asleep . And when he 'd bent down she 'd smelled the whisky and tobacco on his breath , and he 'd talked to her and asked her if she was awake . But she had n't stirred . He 'd touched her ,  |p153and  it had been like ice and like death touching her . Oh , it had been awful . And he 'd gone back to her mother , but she had not slept but had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their loud breathing , and her mother asking her father to hurt her . Yes , she 'd heard that , too . And at last on that awful night she 'd heard her father snoring , and she , an innocent little girl , she had just lain awake , quiet as a mouse , so afraid , and just waiting for the night to end . Oh , would n't the morning ever come ? There he was , snoring again . Peg went to the window and gazed at the dark street . She turned and went softly on bare feet to the bedroom . She stood looking down at her sleeping husband in the darkness . He was snoring away . She did n't know why she did n't scream . She did n't know why she did n't do something . She stood like one frozen . He snored again . She went to the kitchen and poured herself a large glass of milk . She could hear his snores even out here in the kitchen . Was there no escape for her ? Peg gulped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying limply on the kitchen table . All sorts of thoughts were spinning around in her head . Oh , sometimes her thoughts cut to her heart just as if she had been cut with a knife.  --  Oh , the tears in my heart , she tragically told herself . She was getting old . This was the way her life was ending . This ! This was what had become of her.  --  Oh , God , would n't that snoring ever stop ? Stop ! Stop !  --  You 'll never be any good . How often her mother had said that to her . She jerked her head in surprise and fear . It had seemed almost as if she 'd heard her mother 's voice again.  --  You 'll never be any good . Marry him or you 'll become a streetwalker . Her mother had told her that , too , told her to marry Walt or she 'd be a whore . Oh , if she 'd been a whore , her life would have been better than it was , better than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hearingthem now , as if her mother were right here in the kitchen with her . Her mother had cursed her and ignored her and sometimes beat her , and once had even locked her in a closet for hours , yes , for hours , and she could remember being alone in the dark , screaming and beating her poor little fists against the door and crying and being so afraid . Oh , what had she done ? Why had her mother hated her and toldp155her she was no good . And Walt hated her . He hated her as much as her mother had . And was her mother watching from beyond the grave , hating her , watching her from Hell and coming up from the fires of Hell to tell her all over again ?  --  I hate you !  --  You 're no good !  --  I hate you !  --  Marry him or be a whore , you whore ! She seemed to hear the very words , and , with her lips trembling , she looked around the kitchen to see in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell , might be lurking and staring at her , staringwith eyes burning like the coals of Hell and the devil-burning eyes of hatred . Her hand shook . Her nerves ! She pressed her hands hard against her temples . Oh , she had to pull herself together . She had toget it out of her mind that her mother was watching her and hating her from the other side of the grave , from Hell itself . She had always been a good girl . She had . She had done nothing . She had tried , oh , tried to be a good wife and a good mother , and she had grown old doing it , and for what ? For this kind of life ? Asking herself this question , she made a sweepinggesture with her hands . For Walt Callahan , who hated her in this world the way her mother hated her in eternity.  |  --  Dry tears ! She liked those two words . She was shedding dry tears every minute of her life . She poured another glass of milk and drank it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her feel a little better . But not in her heart , her wounded heart . Because her poor heart was cut and wounded . She sighed , lit a cigarette , and puffed nervously . She asked herself who cared about her . Who even knew what she really was , or what her life had been , or what her side of her marriage with Walt had really been like ? Who knew how Walt Callahan had failed her when he could have saved her ? Who knew what he had done to her , to her life ? He had taken her that night in her home , but he had not saved her , and now , every minute of the day and night , he hated her . His hatred of her was killing her . Killing her soul . Peg got up and slowly went back to the parlor . She sank listlessly into Walt 's chair . She wanted the light on , but she did n't have the energy to go and turn it on . She would sit here and wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light . Birds singing in the sunshine . Birds singing and flying away , singing in the sunshine . Peg sighed . Her shoulders sagged . She fixed rigid eyes on the darkness in the parlor . Her lips moved . She said nothing . Then she heard Walt snoring again.  --  Would that old devil never stop it ?  |p157She  slumped farther in her chair . " The hearts of birds . Singing . Sunshine , " she mumbled softly . Suddenly she got up and walked very slowly to the bedroom . She got into bed and curled up closely against Walt . He snored and turned over toward the wall in his sleep . " Why , Peg , you did n't have to get up and cook my breakfast , " Walt said , surprised at finding her by the stove . " I was awake . I did n't sleep much last night , I did n't sleep until dawn , " she said , turning toward him . For a moment she seemed almost unrecognizable . She looked wretched and miserable . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hair was disheveled . There were circles under her eyes . And her voice . She had spoken with such meekness . Then he noticed that her hands were trembling slightly . " Peg , you go back to bed and get a good rest , " Walt said gently . " No , " she said with a quiver in her voice . " I 'll cook your breakfast . " " But , Peg , I can do it , and you look like you need more rest . "  | " I can cook your breakfast , " she repeated , speaking as though she had to struggle to think of every word . Walt sat down and waited , but he wished she 'd go back to bed . She was acting queerly , and she did n't seem well . " Peg , are you all right ? You 're not sick , are you ? " " No , " she said listlessly . He watched her closely as she bent over the stove . God , she was so thin . He felt sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was there anything wrong with her ? " You 're sure you 're all right ? " " Yes , " she said . She sounded as if she would burst into tears at any moment . " I 'm always all right , " she said with self-pity . Walt shook his head from side to side , feeling helpless . Glum and worried , he sat waiting . She set bacon and eggs and coffee and toast at his place . " I hope you like your breakfast . " " It looks fine . " Bringing in a cup of black coffee for herself , she sat down opposite him . Walt ate , but without appetite . She sighed , and he looked up anxiously . " Anything the matter , Peg ? " " No . . . nothing , nothing 's the matter . " Her voice was so strange and sad.  | " Are you sure ? You do n't need a doctor , do you ? Do you want me to stay home from work and take care of you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking slowly and in that same , strange tone of voice . " Because if there 's anything you want me to do , please tell me and I 'll do it . " She did n't answer , but looked into her coffee cup . " I 'm all right . . . all right , " she said in the same way she had a moment ago . Walt kept quiet because he felt that if he spoke , he might rock the boat . Peg sat drinking her coffee and staring past him with a look of utter dejection.  |p163Walt  was happy to be at the family gathering in his son Jack 's house , seeing his kids and grandkids . He liked Maggie , Jack 's wife , and Joe , his son-in-law . He 'd looked forward to this day all week . And it was good not to have to spend the Sundayalone with Peg . It was getting harder and harder for him to have any peace of mind when he was alone with her . And much as he wanted to get away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing it because she asked so many questions and kept trippinghim up even though there was really nothing to be tripped up over . But somehow , because of the way she went at him , she would confuse him , and then she would manage to trip him up . And she would get the idea that things happened differently from the way they really did . She 'd get her own idea of what happened , and she would believe that , even though the truth was completely different . Just beingin the same room with Peg now made him damned nervous , so that he was n't sure of what he ought to say . When he started to talk , he would think of what she might think of what he was saying , and this made him extra careful , because he did n't know how she 'd take it.  | " Father , have some more beer , " Dorothy said . " Yes , do , " Maggie urged . Maggie was small , dark , and thin , and Walt believed Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " Yeh , " Jack was saying . " Yeh , we 're gettin ' our new car . Next week . " " Father , did n't you ever want a car ? " Dorothy asked . Walt hesitated . He 'd wanted to own an automobilefor a number of years now , just as he 'd wanted his own home . But it was Peg . He did n't want to tell Dorothy and his son , or his son-in-law and his daughter-in-law , that his wife would n't let him get an automobile . " I would n't trust myself in a car with your father , " Peg volunteered . " Oh , Father can drive , ca n't you , Father ? " Dorothy asked . " He ca n't even remember where he puts his shoes at night . For all I know , he would want the car to go forward , and , the first thing you know , it would be going backward , " Peg said . Walt felt humiliated . And he noticed that his sonin-law , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " I would n't want to be killed in an automobile accident , " Peg said . " You 're not afraid of riding in cars , are you ? " Joe asked Peg.  | " Goodness , no , not with a good driver . Not with my son John driving . " " Jack , you got something your old man has n't got , " Joe said lightly . Peg glared at Joe but said nothing . He laughed good-naturedly . " I do n't imagine I 'd get any pleasure out of drivinga car , " Walt said . " But the things you can do and the places you can go ! Why , last year my girl friend and her husband , that 's Mary and Pete , they went to California on their vacation and had a grand time . They saw the Grand Canyon , the desert , the Pacific Ocean , and they had a wonderful time , " Maggie said . " Yes , we 've gotten about and seen a bit of the country in our old jalopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , Father , you and Mother could take some trips , " Dorothy said , looking at Walt . Walt nodded his head , and he got to thinking of how little he had seen of the country . When the kids were young , they were n't able to go away on vacations . But , still , Jack and Dorothy went away with their families on vacations . Times had changed that way . During these last years he 'd wanted to go somewhereon his vacations , but Peg never would . And , heck , with an automobile , they could . Almost everybodyseemed to have one , and sometimes at work he was kidded and told he was too cheap to buy a car . He thought , too , of how Peg and he might have done many more things than they had , and that theyp166ought to have gotten much more fun out of life . Certainlyhis children seemed to be enjoying life more than he and Peg had . He was sincerely glad about this , but , even so , it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their bowling now and kidding each other . Joe asked Walt if he bowled any more . " You used to be a good bowler , Walt , " Joe said . " Oh , I do n't know . I just have n't played much in the last few years . " " Jack here is a better bowler than his father ever was , " Peg said . Joe ignored Peg and turned to ' Walt . " Yes , Walt , you were good enough for me to wish you were on my team . " " I 'm gettin ' too old for bowling , I guess , " Walt said apologetically . " What the hell you doin ' , Walt , kiddin ' yourself ? " Joe asked . Walt grinned rather sheepishly . " I remember , Dad , how I used to watch you bowl . You were pretty good , " Jack said . " Listen , he 's still good enough to beat you for my money , " Joe told Jack . " You might be right . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  remember , you took me along one night and you bowled one-sixty , one seventythree , and then two-o-four ? I was proud of you , I was . " Walt beamed . He looked gratefully at Jack , andp167there was a flooding feeling of affection for his son . He remembered the ball games he 'd taken Jack to as a boy . Gosh , Peg had even crabbed about that . He 'd had good times like that with Jack . He became nostalgicfor the days when Jack and Dorothy were young . He guessed maybe those were the best days of his life . He looked at his children tenderly . It was hard to think they had once been little tots and that he 'd carried them on his back . God , it was a mystery the way kids grew into men and women , it was . " Ever see any more ball games , Dad ? " Jack asked . " No , I have n't seen a game in two-three years . I guess I kind of lost interest , Jack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the new car one of these Sundays , and we 'll drive out to the ball game and it 'll be just like old times , Dad . " " Let 's , " Walt said gratefully . " You can ring me in on your jaunt , " Joe said . " Fine , we 'll all three go , " Walt said . " The men of the family , " Dorothy said proudly . Walt grinned sheepishly . He was pleased . He liked Joe , almost like a son . He wished he saw more of him , as well as of Jack , but he did n't because Peg did n't like Joe and always nagged him if he saw Joe , and he kind of thought that she should n't see too much of Joe and Dorothy , lest Joe think Dorothy 's family was interfering . He remembered how Peg 's family always used to interfere in his life . God , sometimeshe even thought that Peg was like her mother . And her mother had sure been one hell cat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young fellow , and he was good to Dorothy . He was pleased by the way Joe and Jack talked to him , and he did n't see why he and Joe and Jack could n't kind of pal around some . But he did n't know how Peg would take it . " Maybe I 'll take up bowling again next winter , " Walt said . Peg frowned at him . Well , he did n't care if she liked it or not , next winter he 'd go bowling with Jack and Joe . Watching his grandchildren , Walt thought again of Jack and Dorothy when they were young . Golly , they 'd been cute . But Dorothy 's boy , little Willie , and Jack 's girl , Marie , they were cute , too . Willie was five and Marie was four . And Dorothy 's and Joe 's one-year-old girl , Catherine , was in the crib . She was as sweet as any baby he 'd ever seen . He really liked kids , and it was wonderful to be a grandfather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandkids . Willie and Marie had been out running in the yard , and now they were pulling little toys and talking , and then they were silent with the Lord knew what going on in their little minds . He enjoyed just watching them . And he was thinking , too , how he had worked to raise Jack and Dorothy , and now they had their own children and were raising them , and that was something . It was something to leave happy kidsp169and grandchildren after you . It made you proud and made you feel that living and hard work were worthwhile . And it just melted you sometimes when they called you " Grandpa . " Peg had gone up to little Willie and asked him to talk to her . " I do n't want to . " " But why ? Little boys should like their grand-mothers . " " I do n't want to . " " But why do n't you want to talk to your grand-mother ? " " Because I do n't like to . " This conversation had hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peg . Hell , he did n't want to hurt her , even though it seemed she often did things that hurt others , and certainly she said and did things that hurt him . Dorothy had n't liked it and had told Willie to talk to his grandmother . But Joe had n't seemed to mind . " Listen , " Joe said , " he talks like that to me . The day before yesterday he said to me , he asks me : Say , who do you think you are ? ' " Joe laughed good-naturedly , and there was pride in his voice . " So I says , A hell of a lot more than you . I 'm your old man . ' " Peg was quiet now , sitting in the corner as if she had been crushed . It made Walt nervous to see her that way . But he did n't know what to say or do about it ; he had n't done anything to cause it , and she could n't say he had.  |p170Now  Willie was in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a soft look came into his eyes . " Yes , Willie , " he said . " Grandpa . Give me a piggy-back ride . " " Sure , I will . " " He 's too old to do that . It might affect his heart , " Peg said . " Yes , Willie , do n't ask Grandpa to do that . Maybe he can do something else for you . Maybe he can tell you a story , " Dorothy said . " I can do it , " Walt said . " If you get sick and have a heart attack , I 'll have to take care of you . But do n't say I did n't warn you , " Peg said to him . " I 'm all right . . . dear . " Walt had hesitated a moment before calling her " dear , " and he knew he had n't wanted to call her that . " All right , Willie , your grandfather 'll give you a piggy-back ride , " Walt said , getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a sudden fear that maybe he ought n't to do it . He wished Peg had n't spoken . " Hold on tight , now , " Walt said after his grandson had climbed onto his back . " I will . " The babyish tones of the boy 's voice touched him.  |p171Children  talked with such innocent voices , he thought to himself . He slowly rose to his feet and , grinning , jogged out of the parlor with his laughing grandson on his back . Peg was morosely silent . The children had eaten separately . Dorothy and Peg had set the table and helped Maggie finish the cooking . Peg had been somewhat in the way , wanting to do things her way , and there 'd almost been a scene between her and Maggie . Peg had kept telling Maggie how hard it was to cook a Sunday dinner for a big family , and that she should n't have bothered to invite Walt and her over until after they 'd eaten . Maggie had assured her mother-in-law that it had been no trouble at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much trouble it was . Now the table was spread with food  --  roast beef and mashed potatoes , vegetables and salad  --  and Maggiehad used the dishes Walt and Peg had given them as a wedding present , dishes she liked and prized , with country scenes on the plates . The sight of the food seemed to cheer up everyone except Peg . Seeing all the food , Walt knew he was hungry and said : " My grandchildren gave me a good workout and worked up my appetite . "  | " I warned you , Walt , do n't say I did n't , if you have aches and pains tonight , " Peg said from across the table . " Oh , nothing like that is going to happen , " Walt told her . " I did n't overdo myself . " " I do n't know where children get all their energy . At the end of a day I 'm often good for nothing , " Dorothy said . " Oh , you 're pretty good for something along about bedtime . Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You better be , too , " Dorothy retorted . Peg frowned . At first Walt wished Dorothy and Joe had n't talked that way , but then he thought it was the way a man and his wife should be about it when they loved each other , and he wished it had been like that in his own marriage . Joe carved the meat and , after putting some on each plate , passed the plate down to Dorothy . She piled potatoes and vegetables on . Soon they all had heaping plates in front of them and began to eat . They ate more than they talked , and for a while there was only intermittent and casual conversation . " Now , back in the Depression you could n't stow away grub like this , " Joe said . " I hope we never have to go through another time like that , " Walt said . " You did n't suffer , " Peg told him . " I know  --  knock on wood . I held my job . Some of the Supervision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them never were brought back . There is one fel/low , Willie Collins . He was a Dispatcher , but they put him on a truck , and it 's pathetic . Every time I see him he talks about when they 're going to put him back in Supervision . And there was a good friend of mine , Simon Murray , he was put on a truck , too . He only retired last year , but his pension ai n't enough for him to live on , so he has a job now as a night watchman . And a lot of men were laid off . I 'll never forget those times , and I do n't want to see them again . Speaking for myself , I 'm glad I was able to put bread on the table for my family every day . " Walt moved everyone at the table but Peg . He had spoken with rising feeling . He was proud that he had kept want away from the door of his home back in those days when so many men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he was married he had never been out of a job . " As a matter of fact , I have n't been out of work since the day I was married , " he went on . He was really talking for Peg 's benefit , trying to tell her that he had done his best . " Well , Walt , I 'll knock on wood myself . I 've worked steady since Dotty and I were hitched up . " " Yes , Joe , you 've been every bit as good a provideras Daddy here , " Dorothy said . " But I sure was on my uppers many times before that . " " You were able to keep your job because Patsy McLaughlinhad respect for me , " Peg said to Walt . Her remark came as a surprise to everyone.  | " He kept you on as a Wagon Dispatcher during the Depression because I met him and his wife at the wake of one of your expressmen , and they liked me . " " Patsy died before the Depression . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the Cubs play a couple of times that year , and they had Rogers Hornsby and won the pennant that year , and I remember it because I was talking about it with someoneat Patsy 's wake , God have mercy on his soul . " " Well , then out of consideration for me he must have left instructions to keep you on , " Peg said . For a moment Joe stared at Peg as if he thought she was n't all there . But Dorothy looked at him anxiously , and after she caught his eye he shrugged his shoulders . " I do n't regret it , but I think I can say it in front of my own children , Walt Callahan  --  I helped you in many ways . It 's me who gave you backbone . When I married you , you were a teamster . " " Mother , we know you did . And Father knows , too , " Dorothy said , trying to check her mother and to appease her at the same time . Walt was embarrassed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mollycoddle and might even pity or laugh at him . " Peg , you can work and clean a house better than me , but I can make a living and do my job at the ExpressCompany , " he said . " Hell , you think Dotty there could run a lathe like I do ? " Joe said . " We got dames at our shop . Theyp175work a little while , and what happens ? They 're off sick . Or when the foreman comes around , they 're breaking their necks workin ' , workin ' us out of a job . They 'll do too much for three days , and the foremanwill be on our tails . Then what happens ? They 're off sick again . " " Men ca n't bear the pain that a woman does . I 'd like to see any man having a baby , " Peg said . " Peg , that 's something you 're never going to see on God 's green earth , " Joe said . Walt took another helping of food from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , but he went ahead , even though he felt he was doing something he ought n't . And yet there was nothing wrong with eating a good , hearty meal , was there ? Then , having eaten too much , he felt heavy and bloated and began to belch at the table . It was mighty pleasant to be sitting out here after dinner and smoke a cigar and be near the grandchildren , sort of watching them and half-listening to them , but at the same time having your own thoughts . And he was proud to think that Jack owned this little house and was paying for it , and it was his , his and Maggie 's . Jack was a smart young fellow , and he was doing fine as a salesman . Funny , Jack being a good salesman , because he did n't act like a lad with the gift of gab . And he had a garden , too , and keptp176it neat , and that must give him satisfaction . He might have done all kinds of things himself if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peg did n't want them to own a home . That time they went looking on a Sunday afternoon , she was so against it that he gave up . And he just let it go since she felt that way . God , seeing Maggie here and his daughter as a wife , it made him realize how different they were from Peg . Like cooking dinner . Maggie and Dorothy did n't complain or talk about it being so hard or of being tired , and , well , they did things so different from Peg . And Jack and Joe were happierhusbands than he was , or than he guessed he 'd been even when he was their age . " Grandpa , she wo n't play , " Willie said , coming up to him . " Why ? " " She wo n't , " Willie said , indignant . Marie ran up to him . " I wo n't . I wo n't , " she said in childish petulance . " Now , what wo n't you do , little lady ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time . Why ca n't he get shot ? " " Because she 's got to be the Japanese and I got to be the American . " " Ca n't you take turns ? " " Yes , Grandpa . But . . . " Willie stopped . " He says grandma is like the Japanese and I got to be like her and be shot . "  |p177Walt  cast a hasty glance toward the kitchen door on his right . God , if Peg heard this . " That is n't nice , to speak like that of your Grandmother , " Walt said in a low voice . " I do n't like her , " Marie said . " She loves both of you . She loves you very much . " " No she does n't . " " Who told you that ? " " She looks like this all the time , " Willie said , making a long face . " She never plays with me . You do . We love you , Grandpa , " Marie said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and father , " Walt said . He looked anxiously at the kitchen door again . He did n't want Peg to overhear any of this . She 'd blame him , and he 'd never hear the end of it . " Why do n't you play another game  --  tag , for in-stance . " " He always catches me , and I ca n't catch him . He 's a boy , " Marie said . " You ca n't be a boy , " Willie told Marie . " Yes I can . " " No you ca n't . " " I can too . " Marie turned to her grandfather . " Grandpa , who made me a girl ? " " God did . " " I want to be a bad boy . " Walt laughed.  |p178Willie  ran off shouting . Marie chased after him , and soon the two children were digging in a corner . Walt puffed on his cigar . He was saddened by what his two grandchildren had said of Peg , and he remembered her , young and beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baby . He 'd been happy then sometimes . She 'd taken good care of Jack and Dorothy , and he remembered her playing with them and often reading them stories at night in the days when she had n't been nervous and cranky . Gosh , he 'd thought her such a good mother then . And Peg washing diapers and getting up early in the mornings to give them their bottles . And staying up all night when the kids had pneumonia . He could remember lots of things about Peg besides her temper , and he could remember loving her , and their hopes for the kids , and , God , now the kids were grown up and he and Peg were old , but they were kids to be proud of . And why should n't she be proud , too ? He did n't know . He did n't understand it at all . " Grandpa ! Grandpa ! " Willie shouted , running to him , with Marie following . He felt great love for the two youngsters as he waited for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come and see it . " Willie and Marie grabbed his hands . He let them pull him up while pretending to read . " Gosh , you 're strong , " he told them . Still holding his hand and chattering rapidly , they led him to the hole.  | " You sit down and rest and I 'll do the dishes , " Peg said in the kitchen . " No , Mother , you go and sit down . I 'll do them , " Maggie said . Maggie and I can do the dishes , Mother . Why do n't you go out and sit with Father and the kids ? " Dorothy said . " I get headaches in the sun , " Peg said . " I have a big old straw hat I can let you put on , " Maggie said . " You cooked and set the table . I 'll do the dishes and give you a rest . " " I can do the dishes , " Maggie insisted . " You do n't have to worry about me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , very well , to get the soap off . You do n't have to worry , Maggie , about my not getting the dishes clean . " Maggie stared at her mother-in-law for a moment , surprised . " Why , I know that , Mother , " she said quickly . " but I do n't ask my guests to do my dishes . " " I 'm family , " Peg said . " Mother , you did plenty of work in your day . Now you should take it easier , " Dorothy said . Ignoring Dorothy 's remark , Peg started for the sink.  | " You girls go and talk to your husbands , and I 'll do the dishes , " she said aggressively . Maggie stepped in front of her at the sink and said quietly but insistently : " Mother , I 'm doing the dishes . You can dry them with Dorothy if you want to . " Peg stared at her daughter-in-law , but Maggie met the stare . Then Peg looked off , smiled meekly , and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy . " Maggie started washing the dishes . She and Dorothytalked proudly of their children . Peg listlessly dried the dishes and showed no interest in the conversation . " Look at him , " Peg said suddenly , pointing at the window . " Look at him down on his hands and knees , digging with the children . " Dorothy and Maggie gazed out the window and saw Walt digging with his grandchildren . " He 's having a good time , Mother . He loves to be with the children , " Dorothy said . Peg froze up and went on drying the dishes . " Father could enjoy life and his old age more if Mother could . It 's sad  --  sad that Mother ca n't enjoy life more , " Dorothy said.  |p181She  was sitting at the dining-room table with Maggie , Joe , and Jack , having coffee . The baby was asleep , and the other two children were upstairs playing quietly . It was dark out , and they were all relaxed . " I hope I did n't hurt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainty . Jack was silent . " Maggie , it was n't your fault . When Mother comes to my house and wants to do things and help me , it 's the same  --  it 's more trouble than it 's worth , " Dorothy said . " She makes me nervous . I guess every woman has her own way of doing things , and her way is different from mine . But it 's more than that  --  she just makes me nervous . And it 's the same when my own mother is here to a family dinner . I do n't want my mother to wash all those dishes . " " I like my mother , but I do n't want her making any trouble or getting in your hair , Maggie , " Jack finally said . Maggie smiled at him . " Father looked well  --  and he had a good time . I could see he did . He loved playing with the kids , " Dorothy said . " Yeh , " Jack said thoughtfully . " The old fellow looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that one of the big shots at the Express Company likes him and that maybe one of these days he 'll get a promotion . Gee , I hope he does . He deserves it , " Dorothy said.  | " I 'll have to take in a ball game with him . I used to get a kick out of going to games with him when I was a kid , " Jack said , a note of nostalgia coming into his voice . " Oh , he was good to us when we were kids . " " He was a grand old man , " Jack said . " You know , he never hit us much . Mother would more than he , but she was a good mother , too . She did lots for us . I feel sorry for her . Even when we were kids she could n't get much pleasure out of us . " Dorothy laughed . " I guess we were devils , though . I was a tomboy . " " I know . You always wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you were ashamed of me because I was a girl , " Dorothy said . " Hell , when you 're a kid , you do n't want girls around . " " Jack , " Joe said , laughing , " they 're still tagging after us . You go in a tavern , there 's a dame . You go in a barber shop , there 's a dame gettin ' her hair cut short or something  --  " " Yes , and you do n't like it , " Dorothy teased . " Who says I do n't ? " Joe asked . " You 're not like Father in that way  --  he never chased skirts , " Dorothy teased . " Yeh , and with all due respects to your old lady , do n't get like her , " Joe said . " I wanted to talk to her but I did n't know what to say  --  I did n't , " Jack said.  | " If you get as nervous as Mother , you ca n't enjoy life . She gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get mad at her and fight with her . When I do , I feel awful afterwards , " Dorothy said . " I always try to be friendly with her , but I would n't go into her kitchen and insist on doing things if she told me not to , " Maggie said . " I remember she was always worried and making a fuss about our coming in the kitchen with dirty shoes , " Jack said . " She looked so unhappy today , I wonder what we can do for her , " Dorothy said . " I worry and think about her a lot . But when I see her , then it all starts again , and she tells me about Father . I love him . I love her , too . But I know Father , and I know she 's wrong and ought to act different with him . " " He 's henpecked , " Jack said . " I do n't henpeck you , Jack , " Maggie said . " You know my feelin ' , Maggie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's is the home . You run the home . I make the dough , " Jack said . Joe yawned . " We 'll have to be going , " Dorothy said . " Do n't you want more coffee or another beer before you go ? " Maggie asked . " I could drink a bottle of beer , " Joe said . " Jack ? " " No , dear . " Maggie got Joe a bottle of beer and poured some in his glass.  | " I just wish I could do something for Mother , " Dorothy said . " Every time I think of her or see her , it makes me sad and worries me . " " Me , too , " Jack said . " Hell , I 'd do anything I could for her and Dad . But they do n't need money . Dad earns a good salary . I do n't know what I can do except tell her to take it easy , and if you say that to her . . . " Jack shook his head from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " " Yes , and it breaks my heart sometimes when I see her ; you know , she 's really aged . " " Yes , she does n't look too well , " Joe said . " You know , Mother was beautiful when she was young , " Dorothy said . " Yeh , I seen pictures of her , " Joe said . " And I have one picture of her when she was Marie'sage . She looked like a darling little girl . She was a beautiful child . Oh , it makes me so sad . " They all became moody and said nothing for severalmoments . Then Jack yawned . " Joe , you 'd better finish your beer . We 've got to wake Catherine up and get her and Willie home and to bed , " Dorothy said . " Okay , " Joe said , yawning too . They all yawned . " Well , folks , thank you for such a wonderful dinnerand a grand day . " " We liked it , " Maggie said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jack said.  | " I like him so much , " Maggie said warmly . Joe nodded . He finished his beer and got up to go . " Today was a nice day . I enjoyed myself , " Walt said , chuckling . " Peg , we got some mighty fine grandchildren , and two good kids , too , in Dorothy and Jack . " It was about nine o'clock , and they 'd just gotten home . Walt felt sluggish . He was sorry they 'd left so early , but Peg had wanted to , and so here he was . The day was over , and this was one day he hated to see end . It had been one of those days when a man was so happy he was sad . He felt good . Yes , it did his heart good to be with his kids and grandkids , and with Joe and Maggie . They 'd all acted as if they loved him , and they made him feel he was somebody . And he was somebody to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peg and himself back home , he only felt lonelier . And Peg had n't seemed to have a good time . She had been so silent and had seemed so unhappy and so angry , it made him feel he 'd done something wrong . He had n't done anything wrong , except maybe overeat . He guessed it was best not to say anything to Peg but just to wait and see if she 'd come out of feeling whatever it was she felt , or maybe say she was tired and go to bed without saying anything to him orp186blaming him . But sitting here and saying nothing and not knowing why Peg looked so angry and unhappy , well , it made him nervous . He had to say something , even though he kind of thought keeping quiet was the best thing for him to do . " Yes , it was a nice family get-together , " he said , hoping Peg would agree with him . " Joe is a brute . I do n't know why Dorothy marriedhim . What did she ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be happy , and Joe treats her nice . I do n't see anything wrong with Joe . " " How could a brute treat a woman the way she should be treated ? And how could you know if a man 's a good husband ? You  --  you are n't a husband . " " Peg , I 've always tried to be a good husband , I have , " Walt said earnestly . Suddenly he remembered how , when he 'd been younger  --  oh , it must have been back when he 'd been in his forties  --  he 'd often wanted another woman , and had even wanted to go to a whorehouse , but he had n't . He wanted to tell Peg this , but he was afraid to . Maybe it was n't fair of him to wish it , but he wished he had done it . Hell , he just felt hurt and all mixed up . He wished she 'd stop . He did n't want any more arguments . That was all . " He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well have married a home as a woman , just the way you did , " Peg said in denunciatory tones . " But , Peg , he is a decent , hard-workin ' fellow . He is . I 've seen many who spend their money on boozep187and beat their wives and chase skirts , and Joe does n't . " Walt knew that he should keep his mouth shut . Peg nervously began to pace the floor , wringing her hands as she did . She gave him the jitters again . What was the matter with her , he asked himself earnestly . " What a show you were today  --  you , a grand-father ! " " Why , the children seemed to like me . I got along fine with them . " " You 're not even ashamed of yourself . You 're an old man , and you have n't even a sense of shame . " " Peg , what kind of talk is this ? " " Oh , the sight of you with your gray hairs and your fat face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face was n't fat , either . She strode out of the room . Seeing his kids today happy and married , he realized that things did n't have to be the way they were with him and Peg . And it was getting worse and worse . He 'd wanted it to be different . Oh , God , this had been going on for years , and he had kept hoping that it would stop , that Peg would change . And all the while he seemed to have known that it would n't . Now , at his age , he had to admit that his life was just full of hell , yes , hell , and that as long as Peg lived it would go on being the same , go on being just full of hell . He became stiff with fear and looked anxiously top188the back of the house . But he had n't done anything . Everybody died . God , strange thoughts came to a man . He lit a cigarette out of his need to relax , to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? She had a glass of beer in her hand . A sulky expression crossed his face . He had n't asked for a glass of beer . " I do n't want no beer , " he said petulantly . " Here it is . I got it for you . Do n't tell my children and my son-in-law and my daughter-in-law and my grandchildren , the way you did today , that I do n't take care of you . Do n't talk about me the way you did to Maggie . " " I did n't say nothing like that about you to Maggieor any of the others , Peg , " he said . " I know what you said . And , oh , what a fool youare  --  not seeing what she 's doing to your son . " " Why , Jack and Maggie love each other , Peg . " " Love ? " she asked vehemently . " I did n't see anything wrong between them , Peg . " " You would n't . You would n't understand that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peg , please  --  " " You like it . You 'd see Jack and the whole world ruined just to get at me . " Walt shook his head as if he were groggy . " Well , now you know that I know your game . " " What game , Peg ? "  | " Your game . " " I 'm not playing any game , Peg . I 'm trying to live my last years in peace and to support and take care of you and myself . . . Peg . " " Drink your beer and do n't tell them that I do n't hop to your call . " " But I did n't  --  " " I ought to be called your bellhop instead of your wife , " she interrupted . " But I did n't  --  " " No man ever talked against his wife the way you talked against me today , Walter Callahan . " " But I did n't say  --  " " Then why was my own flesh and blood so mean to me today  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't treat you bad  --  they love you and they treated us both swell . " Why did n't he keep still now ? He did n't want this to go on . " Swell  --  yes , Maggie practically told me to get out of her kitchen . And all I was doing was offering to help her . " " What did she say ? I did n't hear it . " " No , you did n't . You just told them lies about me , and I was insulted . I 'll never darken their doors again . " " Peg , I do n't know what you 're talkin ' about . Honest , I do n't . " " Now you have the boldness to tell me to my face that you did n't run me down and talk against me. "  | " But , Peg , I did n't say  --  " " They know  --  my son and daughter know . They hate you . They do n't hate me . I 'm their mother . They know , Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and you did n't blacken me and my name to them . The horse manure you flung at me did n't hit me . But you 've talked to Joe and Maggie . And they do n't know  --  they do n't know , and they were mean to me because they 're playing your dirty game . You know , Walt Callahan  --  " " Peg , please  --  " " Admit it ! " " I ai n't done nothing to admit . " She gave him a look of contempt and swept out of the room . It was about ten o'clock . Peg was screaming at him . He felt as if he were sick . It was worse than feeling sick . It was feeling sick in your mind and in your heart . She had called him so many names and said so many things to him that hurt  --  yes , they did . And she would n't stop screaming . The neighbors must hear her , and , God , what would they think ? It made him ashamed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't true , and , by God , he knew they were n't . And here she was , still shouting and screaming and cursing him . He could n't think.  |p191He  could n't sit quiet and hear all this . He was just damned fed up with the way Peg treated him and talked to him and carried on , and he was n't going to sit here like a dummy . " Goddamn you , shut up ! Shut up right now ! " he shouted at her as he sprang to his feet . Peg cowered . She looked at him suspiciously , like a little girl fearfully and carefully studying the face of an adult . " You 've talked too goddamned much already . " Her lips quivered . Beads of perspiration broke out on her forehead . " I 'm fed up with your goddamned talk . Not a goddamnedword of it is true , and you know damned well that it is n't , and I know damned well it is n't . " " You 're cruel to me . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let me alone ? " " No man ever talked to a woman the way you talk to me . " " Talk to you  --  Jesus Christ , do n't pull any sob stuff on me now . " Her lips were trembling and her eyes showed fright . She looked as though she were trapped . For a moment he felt pity for her . But , goddamn it , she jawed and yapped at him and nagged at him until he did n't know if he was coming or going or spinning around like a crazy top . He was going to have it out with her now and settle a thing or two . Then Peg gave him a meek look , turned , and satp192down . She fixed sad eyes on him . and said nothing . " What do you get out of nagging me , throwing all of this goddamned crap at me ? What do you get out of it ? " he asked in anger . She did not answer him . She merely sat looking desolate , fixing sad eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Peg sobbed . " Now you 're going to cry and carry on as if I had beat you . Now we 're going to have tears as if I did something to you . " Peg 's body shook with sobs . Again , Walt was touched . He felt that he was acting rotten with her . But he knew how she had jawed and jawed him . He had all the memories of her nagging , and he could n't stop . He had to make her understand , once and for all , that she had to change her nagging tunes . " What the hell are you crying for ? " She went on sobbing . " What did I do to you to make you cry ? " She wiped her eyes and looked at him helplessly . His arms dropped awkwardly to his side , and he merely stared at her , hurt and bewildered . He realized that after all the years he 'd been living with her he did n't know her.  |p193The  beginning of another week . God , how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , beginning a new week of work to earn money for his family ? Years and years of Monday mornings . And never in all these years of Monday mornings had he felt quite as he did on this Monday morning . And what did he really feel ? It was , well , it was different from anything else he had felt . It was .. . well , it was hopelessness . That 's what it was . He did n't know what to say about Peg , except that as far as he was concerned it was all just hopelessness . He could n't look forward to any joy and peace , to growing old , to going slowly down the other side of the hill , to walking slowly down the big slope in sunshine and contentment . That was what he could n't feel . That was what he could n't look forward to . And a man like him who had worked all of his life and was n't an educated man or a rich man or a famous man could n't look forward to anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why what he felt was hopelessness . And feeling hopelessness like this only made him more sad about the times when he and Peg were young and happy together . He could n't remember those days now the way you should remember good times in the past . Now it hurt too much to think of when he had been so much in love with her and hadp194come home to her and the children , feeling he was building a home and a life , and feeling . . . well , feeling happy . It hurt too much now to remember all of that . But why ? Why ? What had happened to Peg to make her act the way she did ? The car was crowded , as it always was in the mornings , and Walt had n't gotten a seat . He hardly had slept at all last night because of the way Peg had acted . But still he was n't tired . He 'd thought almost all night . He 'd lain in bed beside Peg and he 'd thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had forgotten it all , forgotten their life together in her sleep , but he had not been able to do that because of thoughts of hopelessness . He 'd been sore , but it was something more than being sore . Yesterday , last night , when they 'd come home from Jack 's and she 'd carried on and he 'd bawled her out  --  yesterday and last night had done something to him . Because of Peg he 'd often gone to work feeling rotten , feeling plenty rotten . And yet this morning it was different . He felt rotten , plenty rotten this morning , hanging onto a strap , being jolted , with workingmen shoving and bumping against him , but he felt more than that . Because now he knew something . Now he knew what he should have known for a long time . Now he knew that it was no use , no use whatsoever . Hell , he 'd felt good when he 'd bawled Peg out . No , he guessed he 'd just thought hep195felt good , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . She had cried and just folded up , and she had given him peace then , but what kind of peace ? Hell , he guessed he felt sorry for himself . It was like coming to know that you were an old man , that life was pretty much over for you . And Peg ? She was old , too , and he felt sorry for her . God , the last thing in the world he wanted to do to her was to talk to her the way he had last night . But he had to , because she would n't let him alone , she would n't let up on him . He felt sorry for her , but there was a limit . And now here he was riding to work and thinking again of everything he 'd thought of last night in bed . Some of the men in the car were sleepy . A workingman near him looked as if he were only half awake . On many of the faces there was a look of patience . Did he have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way a man could feel going to work early in the morning , only half awake , and especially on a Monday morning . But a lot of them on this car were young fellows . They had a long way to go before they would ever add up the years of Monday mornings that he had ridden to work in streetcars . And he guessed they were going to work after a night of loving up their wives . Hell , he 'd gone to work like that after having loved up Peg the night before . It was hard to believe this now , but it was true . It had happened to him long ago . But it was hard top196remember nights like that and to remember what it had been like , and what it had felt like . It was all over . Most things in his life were all over . What was he to do but to go on like this ? Maybe he should have known it and understood it before , but , anyway , he had n't . Until last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that he could never expectPeg to change or be different from what she was , and it was a damned bitter pill to swallow . The streetcar was starting and stopping , starting again , jolting the passengers . A few of them were talking , but most of them were just sitting or standing , as patiently as Walt . There were a few women and girls in the car , but none of them were near him . What were they like , and were the older ones better off than Peg or not , having to go to work at this hour of the morning when she could sleep late and did n't have much housework to do , not too much , and had her time all to herself for most of the day ? God , what did Peg do with herself all day ? The jammed streetcar , jolting along on the sunny morning , going a little faster , slowing down , stopping , starting up again . The motorman clanging the bell , the conductor ringing the signal bell to start again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Peg did with herself in the daytime , and feeling a hopelessness that he believed he had never felt before , and then beginning to wonder what life was like to all these other people in the car , wondering if any of these other men felt as he didp197and had wives like Peg . And then , as the car once again came to a stop , Walt asked himself :  --  What do you do to be happy and to have a happy home ? Walt at least had his work . She had nothing . Day after day , she had nothing to do . If she was working , even if she was scrubbing floors in some office building , she 'd have something to do and she would be independent . She would be earning her own pay , and she would n't be the servant and slave of a man . A man ? No , of a brute , a horse who looked like a man and who talked in neighs . He brought home his pay check to humiliate her . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home yesterday he had humiliatedher . And she had nothing to do . All she had to do was to keep the stable for him . And would he be happier in this stable if she tied a bag of oats around his head at night and let him eat it and put straw on the floor ? Oh , she had no life . Sitting slumped in Walt 's chair , with a sad and empty look on her face , she drearily said to herself :  --  No life ! No life ! No life !  --  I have no life !  --  No life ! No life ! No . . .  --  I never had any life , no life ! And how could the horse understand it , how could he ?  |p198A  wild look came into her eyes , and she began to neigh aloud . She tightened up as she neighed , hunched her shoulders , and then a thrill bordering on ecstasy ran through her body . For a moment she felt an extraordinary and strange sense of freedom , as though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed to hear herself neighing as though she were someone else . She got to her feet and let out a new succession of loud , wild neighs . She got down on her hands and knees and crawled around the room , and then she got to her feet , neighed once , and sank back into Walt 's chair , limp and wearied and with her hair disheveled . She sat slumped in the chair , drained of energy , looking old , her face pale , wan , lined , her eyes sunken behind hollowing , wrinkled ridges , focussingon nothing , her hands clasped , and her elbowspressed against her ribs . Then her body sagged as though the energy had flowed out of it . " Horsey , horsey , " she said in a cracked , tired , whisperingvoice . " Horsey , horsey , Walt 's too old to play horsey , horsey , horsey . " She sat slumped for a long time , with a fixed , wild stare in her dark eyes . Peg was very nervous , restless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the morning and earlyp199afternoon had passed . She had the strangest feeling that she had been somewhere else today , somewhere far away from this miserable home of hers , but she did n't know where . Something had happened to her , but she could n't remember what . And she was terrifiedbecause of this . She could n't remember . She knew that she had n't been bad , and yet she felt as though she had been very bad and had done something she would n't want a single soul in this whole world to know about . And now the day was passing . It was getting late , and she had n't done her housework . If she did n't hurry up , she would n't get it done before he came home , and he 'd bawl her out . He was always bawlingher out , the way he 'd done , so cruelly , last night . He had no right to treat her the way he did and expecther , at her age , and after all she 'd done for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect her to be a horse . She was overcome with a strange feeling of terror again . She sank back into Walt 's chair and cowered with fear . She shook , waiting in a paralyzing dread for something to happen to her from moment to moment . Her mind went black , and she sat for some moments . Then she suddenly got up and began to clean the flat with a furious nervous energy.  |p200Just  as he went to work and would go to work for some years yet , if his health did n't fail him , so would he be coming home from work for some years to come , just as he was on this Monday afternoon . And for what ? All day , he had been depressed . He could n't shake off his mood . He could n't forget Peg . He could n't kid himself or fool himself or pull the wool over his eyes any longer . He could n't convince himself that there was any use , because he knew now that it was just no use , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do him a damned bit of good to hope about himself and Peg . And it was knowing this and feeling it as if it was in his blood and bones that made him feel that there was no hope at all . God , he was like a man trying to walk with his feet tied in a potato sack , or trying to hammer a nail handcuffed , or trying to walk blindfolded . Yes , here he was at the end of another day 's work , going home , riding over the old familiar route again , and he did n't want to do it , he did n't want to go home , he did n't want to see Peg and sit down to supperwith her and talk to her and go to bed and sleep beside her . He did n't want to do it . He wanted to go away and start life all over again . But he was too old to do that . What young woman would want him ? What kind of a job could he get ? Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thought thatp201Porky could , fat as he was  --  hell , Porky was fat as a pig . Porky had done it . But , then , Porky had been younger when he walked out and must have had more spunk than he had . No , he just did n't have spirit to do it now , at his age . An evening newspaper was jammed in his coat pocket . He could n't read it . He did n't care what had happened today in the world . He was n't interested in what other people had said and done . If he tried to read his paper , he would read the words all right , but the words would n't make any sense to him . He 'd just read without knowing what he read . That was the way he was this afternoon . He looked about him on the streetcar , and the men and women he saw seemed strange to him . He felt as though he had a weakness they did n't have , and that they might even be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And his weakness was that all of these years he 'd put up with Peg and had n't known . But what had n't he known ? He had n't known . . . known what ? Known that it was no use and that you could n't be happy with her or have any kind of life with her ? No , he had n't known that she was the way she was . And these men and women on the streetcar , they must have some kind of life and get some kick out of life . Thank God , his kids did . And at least there were some men he worked with who did . Heinie Mueller , now , he 'd gotten some kick out of his life . Young Casey did.  |p202Hell  , Casey was n't young any more . Time had passed . He was getting old . He 'd been riding here on streetcarslike this for years , and during that time he had started to get old . He was getting old now , and here he was riding home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight ? Would she give him any peace ? Would she be complaining ? He clutched the strap . The car swayed and jolted . He asked himself :  --  Christ , what is the use ? When Walt entered the apartment , he was too low to want to talk or even to say hello to Peg . But he spoke anyway . " Hello , Peg . " She did n't answer . She stared at him as if she did n't even see him , and she looked so sad and unhappythat he did n't want to be near her . " Is anything the matter , Peg ? Did anything happen ? Are you all right ? " he asked , very concerned . Again she did n't answer . Her gaze was fixed , but she did n't seem to be looking at him or seeing him . God , she gave him the creeps . Just to see her this way made him afraid . He did n't know what to do . He did n't know what to say . " Peg  --  Peg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he 'd never heard her laugh before . He went toward her , and she tensed up and sprang to her feet . " Peg , come on , what the devil is the matter ? " he asked , and as he spoke he put his hands on her shoulders . She shuddered . Her entire body trembled and quivered with fear . She screamed . Walt jerked his hands away from her , drew back , and gaped at her , shocked . It seemed to him that something dangerous had happened to him or would happen to him at any moment . There she stood in the middle of the living room , staring at him with a fishy-eyed look . He opened his mouth to speak but said nothing . He did n't know what to say . Still not knowing what to do , he took off his coat and went to the bedroom to hang it in the closet " Hey , what 's this , " he yelled in surprise . He found two suits of his clothes cut up , tipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and picked up scraps of his blue serge suit and examined them . He was too bewildered to say anything or even to think . He stood , blank-faced , Then he began examining the shreds of his destroyed suits . And his new gray suit , too . My God , was the woman out of her head ? " Peg , " he called.  |p204There  was no answer . He rushed out of the room . She was still sitting mute in his chair in the parlor . He went to her . " Peg , what in the name of God 's the idea ? What happened to you ? Peg , Peg ! Peg , have you gone out of your mind ? " She whimpered . " Goddamn it , you ruined my two best suits of clothes . I paid sixty dollars apiece for them suits . Are you out of your mind , woman ? " She seemed to be very far away from him . " Answer me ? What did you do that for ? " " They told me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They told me to . They told , told , cold , cold ... " She lapsed into silence again and became almost immobile . Walt 's anger collapsed . His shoulders sagged . His arms hung at his side . He looked at her , wounded and hurt . He left the room , went to the bedroom , sat on the bed , and gazed blankly at the ruins of his two suits . He turned , lay down on the bed , and his body suddenly shook with sobs . Peg sat listening to the voices she heard . The voices told her :  --  He 'll kill you . Her eyes came alive , flashed . She stealthily re/moved her shoes and then drew a carving knife from her blouse . She rose and walked out of the room on tiptoe , with a trancelike expression on her face . Walt lay still on the bed , feeling drained and humiliated . He thought he heard a soft movement . He thought he sensed someone in the room . He did n't move for a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peg came across the small bedroom with the carving knife poised over her head . As Walt swung around , she stabbed and caught him in the throat . Blood gurgled out , and he made an effort to rise but fell back on the bed . Then Peg withdrew the knife and stabbed him over and over again . Walt lay dead . His corpse , the bed , the floor were splattered with blood . Her hands and dress sticky with blood , Peg sat by the bed with a wild , mad look in her eyes . Her lips moved , and she mumbled to herself . She sat for a long time , and the house grew dark as she became silent and immobile by the corpse of her husband.  --  I must cook Walt 's supper , she suddenly told herself . She rose , walked out of the room , went to the kitchen , switched on the light , and began to cook the evening meal.  |p32or  less the same way , the few times with Peg before they were married . God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy , you do n't know your father the way I do , " Peg went on . Sometimes he thought that growing old had its advantagesbecause you did n't always like having that fever and desire as much as you pretended you did , and sometimes it left you feeling worse than if you had a hangover . If only growing old could be peaceful . Yet when he sometimes thought of Peg in the past , it hurt . But many things in your life hurt ; yes , they hurt more if you thought too much about them . Peg was laughing at him again . He wished she would n't do that with Dorothy , but then he guessed that Dorothy understood him . How long would Peg talk ? He 'd called in that he wanted to speak to Dorothy , too , but Peg was going on and on , making fun of him . Hell , goddamn it , he was n't the loogin and clumsy ox she made him out to be . But maybe it was because he had n't been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out this way . Still , there had been times when he had , and there had been other times when he 'd want her so badly and she 'd keep him waiting , and then she 'd start a fight with him and nag him just when he was getting in the saddle , and even when he was in the saddle . He guessed that he really did n't know what to think . He was n't educated , and he had n't read the books , and he did n't know lots of things , but , damn it , had n't he tried andp33done the best he could ? He just did n't know what to think . Walt became nervous and impatient and got up and moved about . He wanted to talk to his daughter Dorothy . But Peg was still talking and laughing at him . When he finally got to the telephone , Walt was happy to hear Dorothy 's voice . " How are the kids ? " he asked . Peg had n't asked about their grandchildren . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always talking about you . They love to see you . " Walt choked up . It made him grateful . And Dorothy'svoice , it was so girlish . " I 'll have to come over some Sunday soon . " " Yes , we want you to , Father . You know you 're alwayswelcome , and how much Joe likes to see you , too . " " Joe 's a fine fellow , Dorothy . " He wanted to call her Lovely , because that was what he 'd called her when she 'd been a baby and a little girl , but he could n't quite get himself to . Peg was listening , so he had to be careful of what he was saying , because sometimes she criticized him for what he said to the kids on the phone , and then there was a row.  | " Is Mother giving it to you ? " Dorothy asked himwith an understanding and affectionate little laugh . " Well . . . " he did n't know what to say . " Father , darling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know how she is , and she does n't mean it . She'sjust that way . You know Mother , Daddy . " " Yes , of course I do . And you 're well ? " " Yes , knock on wood . " Now Peg was pacing back and forth near the phone , and this distracted him and made it even harder for him to talk to Dorothy . " Well , we 'll be coming over soon . " " Yes , Father , please do . " " And Joe 's okay ? " " He 's bowling tonight . He 's in some tournament and he 's got a new ball . He said he was going to bowl a two-hundred game , but I kidded him and told him he did n't have the stuff in him . " " What did he say ? " " Oh , he laughed . You know Joe , Daddy . " " Yes , he 's okay by me , Dorothy . " A pause . Peg pacing up and down . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I 'll see you soon . " " Do , Daddy , please . " " I will . " " Good-by . " " Good-by , Daddy darling , and here 's a kiss . " She blew him a kiss over the phone . " Good-by . . . " he said.  |p35He  heard the click as Dorothy hung up . He sat with the receiver to his ear , bewildered and choked up with gratitude . His daughter loved and respected him . He put the receiver back , got up , and looked at Peg , embarrassed . He could n't do anything now . " I think I 'll have a glass of beer and turn in , dear , " he said quickly because of his embarrassment . " I 'll get it for you . You 'll spill it if you get it your-self . " She hurried to the kitchen to get his beer , and he went slowly to the dining-room table . Hell , he knew how to pour a glass of beer without spilling it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer in quiet , and then he 'd hit the hay . Walt remembered how , when he 'd been in his twentiesand even his thirties , he 'd wake up fresh and clear-eyed and feeling his oats . He had n't really appreciatedhow strong and healthy he 'd been . . . . Back in his days on the wagon , he 'd tossed plenty of boxes and crates around and wrestled many a barrel . And he 'd never gotten a rupture , either . He 'd just taken his strength for granted . And in those days , the minute he woke up he 'd be wide awake . Hell , he sure was n't the man he used to be . Now on most morning she woke up gloomy , sometimes feeling aches andp36Mains , just as he did this morning , and he even wondered how he could get through the day . Of course , he knew he could face the day , and that after his coffeehe 'd begin to wake up , and once he got out and into the air , he 'd feel pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the dumps , as he did these days , morning after morning . And then , washing and shaving and fixing his own breakfast  --  the worst of it was eating alone . He guessed he really could n't ask Peg to get up at five-thirty or six , only he wished she would of her own free will . She could go back to sleep after he left , could n't she ? But if he asked her , she 'd raise the roof , and if he got sore and put his foot down and tried to make her , then she might do it and nag him for it , so he guessed it was better to be lonely in peace than to have company without peace . It made him think of that old joke about single blessedness or double wretchedness . Damn it , it got you to think of how once he 'd been so young and strong , and Peg so beautiful , and to remember how so many people had talked about what a fine young couple they were . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ? He began to drink his second cup of coffee and thought of how he had been getting up early and goingto work for years and years . Yes , he 'd gone on all these years , putting his shoulder to the wheel , and he was still doing it . He 'd gone out in the darkness on many a cold morning , and it had been mighty damn freezing on some of those days when he 'd driven ap37wagon . Just to remember them almost made him feel cold and imagine it was winter instead of spring . God , he did n't know how he 'd stood some of those days on the wagon , strong as he 'd been . And he remembered how he used to think he was n't wrestling freight and fighting cold only for himself , but for Peg and his kids . Now , well , it was for Peg and himself , and , well , he wished she were different . These days he kept coming back to the same thoughts more and more . And he kept thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the way he used to imagine it might all turn out . But there had been a time when he used to come home to Peg proud , and see her such a pretty , such a beautiful young mother . He took another sip of coffee . Yes , it had been a long , long time since he 'd driven an express wagon . He knew it was foolish to wish himself back on the wagons and starting out all over again , but he did wish it . He wished he were young right now , only if he was young he 'd be on a big truck or a tractor  --  that is , if he 'd be an expressman . Hell , he could n't be anything else but an expressman , because that was all he knew . He took another sip of coffee . Think of how the express business had changed , and how the horse , man 's best friend , was gone , and sometimes he almost thought he was just like an old horse . He 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day as it might have been ? And then , God , he remembered how proud he'dp38been the night during the First World War , when he 'd come home and told Peg that he 'd been made Wagon Dispatcher and would get one hundred and seventy-five dollars a month . Come to think of it , that had been a damned good salary back in those days . Peg had taken the news mighty casual , as if she did n't particularly care . They 'd even had a big fight that night . He could n't recollect now just what had caused the fight and why they 'd had to have a fight on a night when they should have been celebrating , but he did remember how he 'd gone to bed feeling damned lousy , as lousy as he 'd felt last night . But then , on that night Peg had crawled into bed and kissed him and said she was sorry , and he 'd told her how sorry he was , and they 'd agreed they would never fight again . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he 'd worshiped her ! He took another sip of coffee , lit a cigarette , and sadly gazed at the white ceiling . Suddenly he thought of Patsy McLaughlin . Patsy had made him a Dispatcher . Patsy was dead . He 'd alwayscalled him Patsy . You could n't call Mr. Cartwright , who now had Patsy 's old job , by his first name . But , then , Patsy had been an old-timer , comingup from the wagons himself . He still found it hard to believe that Patsy was dead . It did n't seem true that he 'd be going to work today and not expect Patsy to be coming into the Depot in his Ford coupe . And think of the other old-timers who were gone , too . Jim O'Neill had passed away many years ago.  |p39He  'd been a good man . One of his kids , who used to work in the Call Department , had become a famous writer . Well , more power to the kid . More power to anyone who made something out of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gashouse . What a bull Mac had been . Mac was gone , too . And Mike Mulrooney and Wade Norris and Willie Bryan ; they 'd always called Willie Father Bryan . They were all gone now . He 'd attended the wakes of every one of them ; why , he 'd even been one of Willie Bryan 's pallbearers . And Billie O'Brien , he was gone , too . Billie 's going last year had been heartbreaking . Poor fellow , having to go on a pension before his time becauseof a heart attack , a coronary . And then passing away four months after his retirement . God , how many old-timers would be left when his time came ? God Almighty , he would die one day , and it would n't be too many years away . A man of his age could n't count on living many more years , could he ? He was gripped with fear . He 'd have to go , and he did n't want to , and suppose he had to suffer terrible pains before he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agony , and maybe lying there , and thinking about his life , thinking about what he 'd never got and of his dreams that had never come true . And would Peg nag even when he would be on his deathbedand not even let him die in peace ? But suppose she went first ? He saw himself alone in this little apartment , get/ting up in the morning , just as he did this morning , cooking breakfast , going to work , and then , after his day 's work was done , feeling free , able to do anything he wanted to . But what would it mean for a man of his age to be free ? No , if that happened , he 'd go live with Dorothy or with his son Jack , if either of them would have him . Was n't it awful to think this way of Peg dying ? He felt ashamed of having such thoughts . A man should n't think this way . Maybe it was even a sin . And a man should keep trying to make the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to work . He picked up his dishes , took them to the sink and washed them , leavingthem in the rack to dry . Then he tiptoed out of the kitchen and into the bedroom , resolving to be as quiet as possible so as not to wake Peg . " You do n't have to come in here like a bull in a china shop , " Peg accused him angrily from the bed . " I was very quiet , Peg , " Walt answered , hurt , as he turned from the closet door with his suit coat in his hand . " Quiet ? As quiet as a herd of elephants . " " I 'm sorry , Peg , I tried to be very quiet . " " You wake me up every morning . You do n't carep41bout anyone but yourself , tramping and stamping through the house , banging doors and drawers . How can I go on if you do n't let me sleep ? " " I 'm sorry , Peg . " " You 're sorry ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I did n't mean , Peg . . . I did n't bang nodrawers this morning . I did n't touch them . " " Well , you woke me up yesterday morning slammingdrawers . " " But , Peg , you were asleep yesterday morning when I left for work . " " No , I was n't . Are you going to stand there , Walt Callahan , and lie to my face out of the whole cloth ? " " I 'm not lying , Peg . " " I 'd be ashamed of myself if I lied the way you do , Walt Callahan . " " Peg , I 'm sorry  --  and I got to go to work now if I ai n't gon na be late . " " You do n't have to make as much noise as a housewreckingcompany when you go to work . " Walt checked himself as he was about to answer her . If he got into an argument now , he 'd be late . " Peg , I 'm sorry . Here , kiss me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rest , " he said , going over to the bed . " How can I sleep after you woke me up ? " " Well , try , Peg , dear . " He bent down to kiss her . She raised her cheek to him , but her face was coldly expressionless.  | " Good-by and have a good , easy , restful day , Peg , " he said as he turned to walk softly out of the bedroom . " Yes , have an easy day , " she mumbled to herself . It was going to be another swell day , Walt thought , walking along to the streetcar . But on mornings like this the June sunshine kind of hurt . It made him rememberearly mornings in June back in the days when he was on the wagon and had first met Peggy . He 'd felt so happy then , walking along in the earlymorningsunshine , smelling the early morning  --  why , he used to feel as if the world was . . . well . . . was full of sap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just honey . And Peg , she seemed to be like everything that was good in the world and like the morning , like a beautiful morning . Yes , a swell morning like this just took all the starch out of him now . He walked along at a slow , even , treadlike pace . He remembered Peg this morning , nagging him about making noise , when , hell , he 'd been quiet . It was just like so many other things about her . He just never knew when he was going to put his foot in it with her and when she was going to blame him for something out of a clear sky , and then , well , when she talked like she did to him this morning , she sent him to work down in the mouth and sunk.  |p43At  sixty-three , damn it , a man ought to feel contented , because he was going to be called soon , and at least you wanted to feel at peace as you came close to the call . God , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hug and kiss him at the door and tell him not to get hurt and to come straight home from work because she 'd be waiting for him , and sometimes in the morning they 'd do it , and he 'd go to work grinning and just thinking , goddamn it , he felt good , and he 'd think of her and of her dark eyes , and of the sun and the morning , and she had been June to him , June sunshine . And , think of it , in seven years , he 'd be seventy and retiring . What would it be like then ? He walked on . Others were walking along , past the two- and three-story stone and brick buildings , going to work like him , and he wondered what their lives were like . She did n't have the energy to get up . The morning must be passing , but she did n't care , she did n't want to stir out of bed . When she 'd been a little girl , she used to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was warm and where she could dream and not be afraid of anything . Because as long as she stayed in bed , quiet as a mouse , she felt that nothing could happenp44to her . She could remember herself lying in bed as long as she could , scarcely stirring . And how she used to dream and dream , imagining all sorts of things happening to her , sometimes pretending she was a boy and sometimes dreaming she was a bird . She used to love to think she was a bird and able to fly , to fly away , away far away from her mother and father . She suddenly became afraid , but she did n't know what she was afraid of . She gazed about the dark room and then at the dim morning light in the hall outside the bedroom door . It seemed as if just beyond the bed there were danger lurking in wait for her . Oh , she was unhappy , an unhappy woman . She had always been unhappy , always . Even as a child she 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed then when her mother nagged her to ? Why ? To be abused and spat upon and to be told that she was no good on earth ? Oh , her mother had never been good to her  --  no one in this world had ever been good to her . All her life she had only wanted someone to be good to her . That was all she wanted . Was it too much to ask from life ? Was it ? Walt was a cold man , and no , never , never had he been good and really kind to her . She had given herself to him before marriage because , fool that she was , she 'd believed that if she gave him her all , he 'd be good to her . And now what was there to dream of ? Oh , if she could only be a bird and fly away , fly away from it all ?  |p45She  would still shudder , when she remembered the way her mother used to say to her :  --  You 're a girl . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  --  Peg , you 'll never have a peg . And that time her father beat her mother , it was like a nightmare . Her father , drunk and cursing , chasing her mother around the dining-room table , cursing , oh , he had cursed so . And her mother , screaming and begging him not to hit her , but taunting him , too , and threateninghim with a butcher knife . And she in the corner , wishing there were some hole she could crawl into , wishing she were a mouse , able to get into a crack in the wall . Ugh ! He beat her mother , and she fell on the floor and sobbed , and then her father came toward her , and she ran around the table , too frightened to cry or scream , and she ran because she did n't want him to touch her , and he caught her , and she 'd been so afraid , and he 'd held her on his lap and squeezed her and tickled her , and his breath had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her memory . And she remembered how she only wanted to get away , to bed , anywhere , and she had n't wanted to get up and go to school the next morning , and she had lain in bed thinking she was a bird . She began to move nervously in bed , and then shep46jumped up and threw her kimono on . Trembling , . she searched the apartment as though she were looking for someone or something , and then she went out to the kitchen and turned on the gas under the coffee pot . Yes , if she could only be a bird and fly away . Stretched out on the bed , Walt sighed with pleasure . It was peaceful at home , and he could lie here and not have to do anything until supper was ready . Peg was more herself , and things were just the way he wanted them . And think of it , he had come home worried and just about as down in the dumps as a man could get , expecting Peg to be ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she 'd told him that she 'd cleaned the house today and was cooking him a specially good supper , and she 'd been so friendly , like her old self , she had been just like the Peg he wanted her to be . And she 'd asked him about work today and said he must be tired and why did n't he take a nap ? He 'd asked her if there was anything he could do , and she 'd said no , no , there was n't , he should just take a nap and refresh himself because he worked hard and was the breadwinner . He sighed again . Peg was just nervous , that was all , and these spats and quarrels were not about anything important ,  |p47and  , my God , they had passed their thirty-ninth weddinganniversary , and when a man and woman were married almost forty years , these little spats had to be seen for what they were . Yes , Peg was just nervous , that was it , and maybe he did n't do things the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step more so he could please her on little things . Hell , at the Depot , he would sometimes want to blow his top if things did n't suit him , and today he 'd come near to doing it with Willie Collins , the poor , pathetic loogin . Hell , yes , just as he was Dispatcherat the Depot , let Peg be Dispatcher at home here . If satisfying Peg would make things more peaceful and make her less nervous , then he 'd make a real try . Walt let out a big , comforting yawn . There were good experiences in his life with Peg  --  the kids , grandchildren , memories . And maybe sometimes you foolishly let the good memories get washed out of your mind . You should n't let that happen . He 'd have to keep this in mind when he got to brooding and stewing , so as not to let this happen again . He could hear Peg in the kitchen . She was cooking for him . She did things for him. , and she 'd done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And had n't he taken her when she was innocent and been the only man she 'd ever known ? After it happened in her parlorthat first time , she 'd cried because he 'd hurt her , and she 'd cried in pain , too . But then , later , there'dp48been times when she 'd been so passionate that it had almost frightened him . Gosh , he guessed a man just could n't understand a woman . And their honeymoon . It was kind of vague in his mind , those two weeks . But it had been good , wonderfullygood . Golly , how he 'd like to see Niagara Falls again , that cataract of water going over and making noises like thunder . It had frightened Peg . He could remember how he 'd just stood there and looked and thought of how much power there was in that water , and it had sure been one beautiful sight to see . He closed his eyes and tried to see Niagara Falls , just as if it might be a picture in his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then himself and Peg , Peg , a beautiful black-haired , black-eyed bride in a white dress and a straw hat , his Maid of the Mist , standing at the rail , and the water splashing , and that thunder of the water , and the foam and the colors of the water down below , and he 'd just looked and looked and thought of God , and he 'd wanted to stay and just look at the falls , only Peg had seen enough and said she wanted to go , so they had n't stayed there that extra day the way he 'd wanted to . And New York and Atlantic City and the Atlantic Ocean and Washington , D.C. At times , though , . they 'd both felt a little lost , especially in Washington , D.C. , looking at the Government buildings . But just think  --  how long ago that was . Why , Woodrow Wilsonhad been President . And , come to think of it ,  |p49F.D.R.  had been Assistant Secretary of the Navy . And now they were both dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all that had happened in the world since their honeymoon . Why , for him that was the olden times now . And yet it did n't seem so very long ago that he and Peg were getting on the train in Washington and coming back here to start their life and build a home and be happy . Yes , he and Peg had had their whole life together , and should n't that be more important than any little squabbles ? But , damn it , he had n't even begun to enjoyall the happiness he 'd hoped for when they were riding back on that train from Washington . He guessed , though , that no man ever saw his dreams come true . Still , he was going to try to get some peace and contentment out of these last years of theirs . And he was going to try to begin right now . Walt let out another big , contented yawn . He listened to the sounds Peg was making in the kitchen with a quiet feeling of pleasure . " Peg , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be better . " " It does n't have to be any better to satisfy me . Youknow how I am , Peg . I do n't want much , and I don'texpect too much so long as things go along smooth . " He was trying to tell her that he would n't complainp50and that it should be easy for them to get along and live in peace , if they just put their minds to it . " Well , it 's about time you changed . " " Have I changed , Peg ? " he asked in surprise . " It 's about time you did . " " But , Peg , I do n't ... " Walt stopped . He did n't want to say anything to precipitate a row . " Peg , let us both just get along with each other . I was thinking , lyin ' down just now , of our honeymoon . Remember Niagara Falls , Peg ? And Atlantic City and the ocean and Washington , D.C. ? " " Yes , " she said curtly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peg ? " " I did n't want to stay long in Niagara Falls . " " We did n't . Remember , Peg , you wanted to leave , so we did ? " " All there was to see was water . You can go to the lake front here and look at Lake Michigan if you want to look at water . " " Peg , let 's just take a ride on the streetcar tonight and go sit by the lake . Remember , we did that a. couple of times years ago ? " " And come home all worn out ? I 'm tired . I worked hard today . I cleaned the whole apartment and cooked and did the shopping . I 'm so tired I can hardly eat . " " Well , let 's do it some one of these nights . " Peg did n't answer . They went on eating . Then she said :  | " You never brought home all that back pay . " Walt was startled . He did n't know what she was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a guilty look , too , " she said , speaking rapidly . " But . . . but , Peg . . . why , there ai n't been no back pay in over a year . " " I do n't care , I do n't ask you to bring me home your pay check like some wives , but you could be a man , an honest man , and not lie to me . " " But , Peggy , I do n't know about no back pay . " He tried to remember if he might be wrong and was forgetting some possible back pay he might have gotten . And he felt nervous , too , as if he 'd really done something wrong . He tried to assure himself that his conscience was clear . " You have the boldness to say to my face that you did n't lie to me and deceive me about that back pay ? And when you have such a guilty look in your eye , too ? " " I ai n't deceived you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peg hon , " he said . " And I do n't know about any guilty look in my eyes . " " And you came home that time laughing about McGinty . " " But , hon , McGinty is dead . He 's been dead for years now . " " I know what you 've been doing and what you 've been like all these years , " she snapped at him . " But what have I been doing and what am I like ? "  | " I should have known better , but I did think that some day you would get off the wagons and not go on acting like a teamster . " This hurt him . He was . . . well . . . a little bit proud that he had come up from the wagons , and there was nothing wrong with a man having once been a teamster , was there ? " It 's the manure , " she went on , speaking with contempt . And this hurt , too , especially because of the resolutionhe 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before supper . " But , Peggy , what did I do , " he asked rather plaintively . " You know what you 've done to me , " she said almosttragically . " I wish I did . " " There , there , you admit it , " she snapped . " What did I admit ? " he asked , now utterly bewildered . " You asked me what you did to me . " " But what 's that got to do with what you 've been saying ? " Peg began to cry . He sat , helpless . His appetite was gone . What could he say ? What could he do ? What had he done ? What was this all about ?  |p53Peg  seemed calmer after she had her coffee , but she looked old and sad , like a woman with some great suffering in her life . He was still hurt and puzzled by her outburst , but he felt sorry , too , seeing her this way , so sad , and noticing that she looked old , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her mouth , and the gray in her hair . She had once been his wild Irish rose . " I 'll do the dishes now , " she said dully . " Peg , let 's leave the dishes and take in a movie . It 'll make us both feel better , and then I 'll do them when we come home . " " Yes , and let my kitchen swarm with cockroaches , " she answered . " But if you just stack the dishes up in the sink , how will that bring on a swarm of cockroaches ? " " Mrs. Zale downstairs is filthy , and I do n't know how we 've escaped cockroaches . If I was n't so clean , we 'd have them , too . " " Yes , I always say you 're one of the neatest little housewives there is . " " Oh , no , I 'm not . But I do n't want my home to be like a stable . " " And you 're a wonderful cook . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wasted . "  | " I really liked it , I did , only I . . . oh , come on , Peg , let 's take in a movie at the corner . " " I have a headache . " " I 'll get you some aspirin . Here , let me get you some aspirin and then let me do the dishes . " He ran to the bathroom and returned with aspirin . But she would n't take it . " Peg , let me do the dishes . " " Yes , and leave grease on the plates so I 'll be ill next time I use them . " " Well , if I do that , you tell me and I 'll do them over . " " And you 'll keep me in the kitchen like a slave . " He started to say something else but stopped . Heforgot what he had just wanted to say to her . Hestood with his long arms akimbo . Then he shruggedhis shoulders and walked dejectedly into the parlor . Walt was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way she 'd been tonight , the nights were long , and he did n't know what to do with himself . He got restless , and he could n't keep his mind on his newspaper , and he could n't even concentrate and listen if he turned on the radio . If he went to a movie by himself , then maybe she 'd raise the roof . If she 'd go to a movie with him , it would be good for her , an escape , but he just could n't make up his mind to getp55up , go out into the kitchen where she was ironing , and try to convince her . And he felt that he had betternot go to the show alone . But , hell , why did she have to be ironing at this hour ? Did n't she have all day tomorrow ? He just did n't get the logic or sense of how Peg did things . The parlor was clean and neat . Peggy kept things clean , all right , but she wore herself out doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worked all his life and supported her . She had never gone in want , nor had he beaten her up the way some fellows beat their wives . God , in what way was he unfair to her ? But sometimes he felt as if he were . And night after night he was unhappy , just as he was now . Why did he have to come home from work to nights like this ? " Oh ! " Peg exclaimed . He looked up . But she was already on her way out of the room . " Peggy ? " he called . There was no answer . " Peggy ? " he called more loudly . She came back to the parlor . " You do n't have to scream at me , " she yelled . " I was n't screaming . " " I 'll ask Mrs. Condon next door if you were n't . " " But , Peggy , I did n't notice you come in and just called to ask if you wanted something or wanted me to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to get down on my knees and plead with you . "  | " But , Peggy  --  " he began . She interrupted , talking very rapidly . " You shout around here the same way you do at the express Depot . You treat your own home as if it were a Depot . Ca n't you ever forget the Express Company and be  --  " " But , Peggy , I was n't thinking about the Express Company or work . " " Be a man and have a little refinement and gentle-ness . " Walt was too surprised to say a word or to know what he thought . He just wanted Peg to stop . If she would only be quiet and not fly off the handle this way and keep nagging him . " Peggy . . . " he began . He was going to ask her please to calm down and then to let them both forget this quarreling and bickering . But she walked out of the room again . He slumped in the chair . Sometimes he felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really needed was a good punch in the nose or for him to grab her and put her across his knees and just paddle that behind of hers until it hurt . But he knew he would n't do it . No , a man could n't hit a woman . God , he remembered that time when he was a kid , he must have been ten , and his mother and his old man were screaming at each other , and his old man hit his mother . He could still remember his mother just crumbling up and falling , and himself , with all of the Bejesus just frightened out of him , and for maybep57a minute or two he 'd even been afraid his father had killed his mother . It had made him just sick and so afraid , he 'd shaken in a corner . And he 'd hated his father for it , and after that he 'd always had different feelings toward his mother and father . And he 'd rememberedthis when he 'd married Peg , and he 'd vowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got with Peg , he 'd never hit her , and he was proud of himself for that . God , though , thinking now of his old man beating up his mother gave him a sad feeling of uselessness . They were both dead , may God have mercy on their souls . It was as if it did n't matter now what they 'd done , or what it meant to him and his brothers and sisters . It was all long ago , and here he was at sixty-three remembering it . And how he 'd been knocked for a loop , too , when his mother had died . He 'd been sunk then , but he 'd told himself that you had to be a man and face up to the sorrows of life , and this had helped him come out of the depressionhe 'd felt . He sighed . It was no use thinking of all kinds of sad things like that from a man 's past . The house was quiet . He hoped the storm was over now for the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar and suspicious and accuse him of all kinds of things , and then she 'd calm down and you would n't think she was the same personshe 'd been only a little while ago . He tried to read his paper , but he could n't keep his mind on it.  |p58He  just wished Peg would n't nag him . God , he did n't know what he did that caused her to nag him so much . He 'd always believed he was pretty much the same as other men . He did n't want to go on thinking about this . He became very uneasy . Sometimeshe was afraid that maybe the reason Peg was so nervous and cranky was that he had n't satisfied her . She acted toward him as if she had something against him and did n't respect him . Hell , he might as well be honest with himself and not kid himself . Yes , he guessed that this was pretty much true  --  Peggy did n't respect him . But it hurt to admit this to himself . It did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were lines in his face . And he could feel his years in many ways . Sometimes he got tired . If he went at it too fast about the Depot , he 'd puff . His legs got tired and achy if he was on them too much . And , God , when he looked at young dames , he felt it and knew it . Like last Sunday . He and Peg had taken a walk . He 'd wanted to talk with her , just about little things and about when they were young . But he just had n't been able to say anything . He had tried to , two or three times , but Peg had snapped at him , and then he had n't been able to talk to her at all . She had put the damper on him . And he 'd thought that here were himself and Peg , alone , and their son and daughter were married . Yes , they were alone . They did n't see young Jack and Dorothy much , or their grandchildren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much to say top59each other unless it was to fight and squabble . Why , they were strangers to each other . And he 'd noticed the young girls . Peg had been a young girl once . And they had once strolled the way those young girls and fellows had last Sunday , some of them holding hands and in love so you could see it , acting and looking like nothing else in the world mattered but love . And walking with Peg and thinking , his heart had suddenly gone out to her . He 'd imagined she was thinking the same kind of thoughts he was thinking . Seeing so many pretty young girls on the streets , it must have hurt her . Once he 'd taken her hand and squeezed it and she 'd squeezed back . He 'd felt kind of close to her then , felt that they did have each other . But in a couple of minutes she 'd snapped at him.  --  You 're beginning to walk like an old man , Walt.  --  Well , Peggy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing so bad . Lots of men are in worse conditionthan I am at my age.  --  You 're old . You look old . You act old . Why do n't you buck up ? I do . I do n't just give up and say I 'm an old woman the way you do.  --  I 'm not an old woman.  --  You 're sometimes like an old woman . That hurt , too . He 'd wondered was Peggy telling him the truth ? For a few moments he 'd wanted to crawl into something and hide his head . And so they had just walked on in silence . But itp60seemed to him that there were two kinds of silences . There was that being silent when you were feeling contented , and there was that being silent when you knew that if you were n't it would only mean arguing and misunderstanding and hurting each other . The kind of silence between them as they had walked had been no good . And it had hurt all right to see the girls , all dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their legs , the girls on the streets , and he could n't help it , he just wished for what he knew he could never have again as long as he lived  --  a young girl . And then he got to thinking and wondering and asking himself questions . These young girls , God , they looked like the most beautiful things in the world . But did they have to end up like Peg ? Because , yes , Peg had been as pretty as many of the girls he saw on the streets last Sunday . And when she was young and togged out in all her finery , why , old men must have looked at her in just the way he 'd looked at the young girls last Sunday . " Well , dear , another day , " Peg exclaimed calmly as she came into the parlor and sat down . " Yes , " Walt said cautiously , surprised at her change of mood . " I finished the ironing . "  | " I 'm glad . " " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , thanks , I might not sleep if I have too much . " " Yes , I do n't think you should drink so much cof-fee . " " I think I 'll start to cut down right away . I must have had six . . . no , eight cups of coffee today . " " That 's too much . It is n't good for your health . " This remark scared him . Maybe this was the start of something , telling him he was old , that he was sick , or that maybe his heart was n't good . " I have to take better care of you , hon , " she said . " You do pretty good , Peg , " he answered . " I try . But I ca n't stop you from drinking too much coffee . Goodness knows I try , but you do n't always listen to me . " " I will , " he said . He had wanted to add , " Mother , " but somehow he stopped and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids and then because they had grandchildren . He 'd always liked doing it , even though now and then he would have some kind of feeling , as if there was something in him , some voice or something inside him , that wanted to tell him he should n't call her Mother . " You know , Peg , how it is down at the Depot . It gets noisy , and sometimes I get tired , and there are dull periods of the day , and . . . well , I guess I just got into the habit , so when I find myself feelin ' tired and kind of dopey or groggy , why , I just tell my kidp62who writes sheets for me to run across the street and get a can of coffee . But I 'll watch myself . " He looked down at the newspaper he had dropped on the floor by the side of his chair . He wanted to pick it up and read it , not because he was interested in the news but because this was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say for fear of how she 'd take it . He did n't like to worry about himself , and he did n't like to think about his heart and about dying . At his age , a man could have a heart attack . Some did . He 'd always been healthy , and there was n't no need to worry , but you never could tell . Look at poor Billie O'Brien . Every day men his age were droppingoff . " You breathe fast , too . Sometimes I worry about you , Walt , " Peg said . " I do n't breathe too fast , and I think my ticker 's pretty good , considering my age , " he said , speaking rather quickly . " It is n't my fault . I 've done my best . I 've tried to see to it that you get rest , enough sleep , and the right food . It 's not my fault . " Walt was sweating under the armpits . " Maybe I ought to go to the doctor and get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peg made no comment . She was gazing at the windows . There was a funny or a strange look in her eyes , as if she was n't interested in him or in what he was saying but in some/thing else , something that might be running through her head . " Well , do n't you want me to get it for you ? " " Get me what ? " he asked , surprised by the questionbecause for the moment he did n't recall herasking if he wanted her to get him anything . " Coffee . " " No , I do n't think I 'd better take any more coffee tonight . " " Well , you asked me for it . " " I did n't  --  I did n't ask you , Peg . You asked me . " " You 'd keep me running back and forth all night , serving you like a slave or working myself to the bone out there in the kitchen while you sit on your behind like the lord of the house , and I hardly get time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But , Peggy . . . " he began , speaking slowly and in a low , dispirited voice . He told himself that what she was saying was unfair . " You do n't have to treat me like a chauffeur . I 'm not a teamster . I 'm not a manure whaler the way you used to be when I first met you . And do n't make faces at me . I 've done nothing but slave for you and take care of you and wash your clothes . And do you realize how many times I 've had to mop the bathroomfloor because you ca n't hit the toilet bowl ? " Sometimes she said things to him that was like hittingbelow the belt . It was unfair . It was as if he were to throw up to her that she had the monthlies **29;5593;TOOLONG , safe from the jeers of the Colonists , she kept the Hon. Mr. Weepswell 's favorite Morris chair . She was the first person except the amiable Dodsworths to make Hayden feel so warmly at home that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Florence as in Newlife . When you looked at Tessie Weepswell you did not see a woman of sixty but the glove-soft credulous girl who had been sandbagged by the Honorable Orlando . You saw her pretty fleetnessand innocence all unchanged , and her eyes undimmed . Her voice was still quivery with enthusiasms about ice cream and kittens and James Whitcomb Riley . It was just that over her face was a dusty veil of many years ' weaving which , surely , she could twitch away whenever she chose . " Now you must rent a villa and live here , Mr. Chart , " she panted . " Honestly , we need you ! " ( One likes to hear that , especially a shy and warm-hearted man like Hayden . ) " The minuteI spotted you here I said to myself , ' Now there 's a man with sensitive feelings , that ai n't a lotus-eater like the rest of us gilded snobs , and that would be real nice to sit and visit with ! ' And I 'll bet you 'll learn Italian like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , today I 've picked up the Italian for ' where is ? ' and ' veal ' and ' consomme with noodles . " " My , that 's wonderful ! In one day ! You 're a real linguist ! But how well do you know your Ely Culbertson ? " " Perfectly . " " I knew you were a scholar , minute I laid eyes on you . You 're invited to tea at my little shack whenever you feel the least mite lonely . " Hayden was pounced upon then by Augusta Terby  --  Gus -- ap51fine , flushed , tennis-leaping English girl of thirty , who looked like a roan horse and who was attended by a mamma who looked like a suspicious pony . Augusta believed that all American males were rich , and willing to be espoused and have some one to send out the laundry . She invited Hayden to play tennis and have a nice cup of tea at their villa . He felt more than ever a citizen of this generous frontier village , the Colony , and Augusta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , that this time she really had solved her matrimonial puzzle , while Augusta 's mother asked Hayden how he liked London  --  a sign of recognition with which she favored very few of these strange , loud American Cousins . With these pawns there were larger chessmen on the Dodsworths ' black-and-white checkered-marble music-room floor . Hayden was privileged to see Sir Henry Belfont , Bart. , that mossiestand most moated of British historical monuments , an outsizedonjon-tower in morning clothes , with a deerpark of eyebrows , and Lady Belfont , a small and silent American heiress . Sir Henry welcomed Hayden with what he considered absolutefolksiness : " Ah . An American ! " " Yes . " " Ah ! You are staying for some time ? " " I hope so . " " I am afraid you will find our Florentia very provincial , after your resplendent Hollywood and New York ! " Nevertheless , Sir Henry had apparently let him in . Hayden was most taken with a Santa Claus of a man , beard and round belly and kind , discriminating eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost half ap52century ago . Friar was talking with his friend Prince Ugo Tramontana , shaven and tall and lean , the last of a fabulous but decayed Tuscan family . Mrs. Dodsworth whispered that these two men were the only near-rivals in Florence of Bernard Berensonin knowledge of early Italian art and love for it . They attended the Dodsworths ' clinics because they liked the host and hostess , and because the food was rich and piled high , and neither of them got very much of it at home . They bowed to Hayden amiably , and he felt that he would like such men as neighbors . They were the keepers of the learning that he desired . All this while , even when he was being bright about backhandshots with Gus Terby , he had been looking past the others at a young woman of twenty-seven or - eight who seemed as out of place as Hayden himself . I Ie thought of ivory as he noted the curious Mediterranean pale-dark hue of her oval face , of her competent hands , which would he smooth to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horn spoon , as a tortoise-shellbox , as an ivory crucifix . Her black hair was parted above the oval ivory face ; over her head was a gold-threaded ivory-colored scarf , and her dress was of pure cream-colored wool with no adornment except a broad belt of golden fabric . There was something Latin , something royal in her , something almost holy , free from human vulgarity and all desire except for the perfection of sainthood . When this paragon joined Professor Friar and Prince Ugo , with whom she seemed to be on terms of familiarity and respect , Hayden asked Mrs. Dodsworth , " Is that girl talking to Mr. Friar an Italian ? She could be a principessa . " " No , she 's a plain Miss , and she 's an American , but she doesp53speak Italian almost well enough for a native . Her name is Olivia Lomond  --  Dr. Lomond , I suppose it is . She 's a professor , or assistant professor or something , in the history department at the State University of Winnemac , of which my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know her , because I imagine she looks down on us bridge maniacs . She 's doing research on some manuscript records in the Laurentian Library for a year or so . Would you like to meet her ? " He earnestly would . Olivia Lomond , when he talked with her , was a little blank ; civil enough but not interested . Yes , she was collating some Machiavelli and Guicciardini manuscripts with early official recordsof Florence ; a dusty job , not very rewarding . Yes , she taught at Winnemac : Early European History , especially the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in Italy . Hayden tried , " That 's a period that , just now , I 'd like to know more than anything in the world , and I 'm as ignorant of it as a Colorado sheepherder . It must have so much more than just sword-and-roses romance . " She nodded and she said nothing , but her expression said clearly enough , " Yes , of course you would be ignorant of it ; you , the American businessman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasted , " Naturally , as an architect , I suppose I could draw from memory the floor plans of the Riccardi-Medicipalace . " " Oh ! Oh , you 're an architect ? In the States ? " " Out West . Newlife . Do you know it ? " " I 'm afraid not  --  afraid not . " Nor did she seem very much to want to know it . She was merely paying a conversational rent on her cocktail . " Do you speak any Italian ? "  | " I 'm afraid not  --  no . " He was determined to be as lofty as this goddess whose ivory veins were filled with ice-cold ink . " You should speak it . " " Why ? " " If you ask that , you answer me . " " It 's not a very important commodity in Newlife . But then , you probably do n't think much of Newlife . " " How could I ? It just has n't entered my philosophy of life . I have no doubt it 's a very friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most enterprising spots in Nebraska . " He let it go . He disliked her ; perhaps , with a little attention to it , he could hate her . She seemed indifferent not only to him but , as she glanced about while they talked , to all males . Only when it fell on old Professor Friar , in his shabby sack suit and ill-regimentedbeard , was her look kindly . She had bartered her soul for trifles of learning that were no more important , in the atomic age , than a list of Assyrian kings . Suave as ivory , passionless as ivory , Olivia Lomond made him suddenly prize the file-rasping fussing of Mary Eliza Bradbin  --  about bidding and rubber overshoesand sandwich fillings  --  as fecund and womanly . Uninterestedly continuing her social duty , Dr. Lomond droned at 1 layden , " Arc you staying here for some days ? " Astounded by his own news , he heard himself asserting , " I may stay here for some years ! " " No ! Really ? " He had aroused her  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a donkey cart in the street , and , as she said " Really ? " he had perceived that her voice was beautiful : melodious , rather grave , suitable to a woman all of ivory.  |p55She  sounded almost half-interested with , " Are you to have an official position here ? " " No . No job . I shall just be studying  --  go back to school in my senility . I want to master your blasted Italian speech and history . " But there never was anything so cold as her , " I 'm sure that will be amusing , " and she turned to talk to Augusta Terby . He had meant it  --  for that moment he had . He would set up shop as a scholar ; he would be an Erasmus , a Grosseteste , an Albertus Magnus , if only to show this intellectual snob of a lady professor . But he did not like her enough to hate her ; to want to hurt her . Dr. Lomond fascinated him like a rattlesnake on a putting green . He kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while she talked , seemingly on level terms , with that great gentleman , that superior historian , Prince Ugo Tramontana . Her voice came across the room to him like the flowing of small waters , not the flat , provincial- quacking of so many vigorous young women at home . Whether or not he would attain it , Dr. Lomond was worthy of a good healthy hating . He would show her , and in her show the whole wide world.  |p56HI  S good-night from Dr. Lomond was as curt as though she did not remember ever having seen him . Her eyes were beautiful , and so unmoved , so superior to all the angry , corrupting temptations of life , he reflected , because she did not know that there were any temptations . Ile thought rudely , " I 'm going to get a D Minus in her class and there is no use trying to bluff her . She would n't he angry . She 'd just efficiently flunk me . " But the Dodsworths so warmly invited him to return that he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hill to his hotel , and considered himself rather heroic over a foot journey of half an hour . In Newlifea man , unless he be strengthened by carrying a golf club , has to take out his car for any distance of more than three blocks . He found Professor Nathaniel Friar also intending to walk . Apparently to him , walking was not a new invention , startling and rather risky , but a normal means of getting places . So oldfashionedhad this Bostonian become in his four decades abroad . They jogged downhill together , looking at the light-prickedp57city below and at the road lamps looping up the hill to Fiesole , miles away . " You had an agreeable time , talking to Miss Lomond ? " said Professor Friar . " She seems intelligent . But a little distant . " " She 's cool . Women scholars occasionally get like that . They 're dedicated . Frequently they are n't certain to what they 're dedicated , but clearly it ca n't be to such wingless objects in trousers as you and I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite useless facts , so naturally she seems a bit suspect to most men  --  and to all women . You ca n't ask femalesto burn with a hard , gemlike flame ' and still be obliging about waffles at midnight . Here we are . This is my place . Do come in and see it . " " Professor " Friar , oftener known as Nat , had never been a regularlyenlisted professor of anything beyond Veronese wines and the more acceptable sorts of Italian sausages , nor had he ever written anything more popular than articles in journals of art criticism so learned that just the look of the gray , close pages made your eyes ache . But he had explored every Tuscan and Umbrianchurch and village , and he could tell you the name and dates of every third-cousin of Domenico Ghirlandaio . For twenty years he had lived in this five-room wing of the massive Palazzo Gilbercini , sharing the geometric gardens and their cypress alleys ending at coy nude statues . He had never been rich , but the securities left to him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a few casks of wine , a great many books in eight languages , a Perugian altar cloth of 1235 , half a dozen chairs , a canister of Earl Grey 's Mixture tea for his friends , and one noble picture : an Annunciation byp58Getto di Jacopo , a picture reverent and softly human , soft blues and grays against lambent gold , the kneeling angel so exalted , the Madonna so timidly proud , her head bent over the lily in her fragile hand . As Hayden stared at the Getto , hung against a faded Egyptian rug above a table bristly with old pipes , he began to take hold of the medieval passion for identification with the divine spirit and its longing for authority , earthly and heavenly . He drank his vermouth and lemon juice  --  Nat Friar considered cocktails as he would a griffin : exciting but not practical  --  and he looked at the comfortable frowsiness of Nat and felt at home as he never had felt at home at home . Nat Friar was large and fat and thick-bearded and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest ; his rather small living room smelled of tobacco and brandy ; and he loved to sit up all night and talk about immortality and Baron Corvo and the Lucca Cathedral . " Why have you lived here so long ? " demanded Hayden . " Or is that impertinent ? " " No , nothing more pertinent . In my case , it might seem to be a self-indulgent escape from reality and the dry-goods business , of which my paternal grandfather was a ferocious pioneer armed with a yardstick . But I think my life has been devoted to proving that one can be just as smugly self-righteous and still do no honestwork . " My occupation and my vice are hoarding useless knowledge , I know more about the history of the Palazzo dei Consoli at Gubbio than any other living man , and nobody cares , including myself . And I like to go on sprees of something new : biologyp59or Sanskrit . Learning , for its own winsome , perverse self  --  hug it to you but keep a club handy . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trusted . " Particularly must one avoid the superstition that there is some mystical virtue in erudition . We all feel that some day we shall be sought after by the pretty girls for our spoken Arabic , our kindness to Cousin Mimosa , or the neatness in which we keep our medicine cabinets . We sha n't ! These virtuous doings should be cultivated for their own sake alone . " I have of late been peeping into the history of the Baglioni family of Perugia , a charming chronicle , all iron and gold clotted with fraternal blood and the tears of ardent young widows . What subject could be more beautiful and useless ? Guard your idleness . You are surrounded by barbarians armored with sobrietyand punctuality and the Book of roor Useful Facts . Be ye watchful in sloth , lest ye be corrupted into industriousness and become a Public Figure , a supporter of all worthy causes , a member of the Elks Club and the Legion d'Honneur , and have five hundred citizens enjoy your funeral  --  at fifty . " " I 'm safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm an architect  --  thinks I 'm poetically impractical . Tell me : how shall I go about learning Italian ? " " Look over the several accredited springs of Tuscan undefiled : the university , the commercial language schools , the highly educateddecayed professors who combine Italian grammar with voice-culture and the black-market exchange of dollars . Then forget all of them and get a girl . " " I might ! " " I do n't mean one like Miss Lomond , who would teach youp60Dante 's directions to Hell , but one who will teach you important things , like These pair of socks by favor to darn ' and , Bring to me suddenly a plate of anchovies : " " Are Dante and anchovies incompatible ? " " Linguistically .

You may find her admirable . " " Well , she might introduce me to some American students more nearly my own mental age  --  sixteen ! " He sat in what was to become his favorite room in Florence , the bar of the Hotel Excelsior with its dark mirroring wood and its two bartenders , Enrico and Raffaele , the men in town most worth cultivating , and he contentedly planned to stay in Florence for a week , a month , a season . He would pray for a Biblical miracle : to become again as a little child , and go back to school . Next morning he again climbed the Torre del Gallo Hill , to have by clear light the view he had seen in twilight enchantment . Below him he saw the bronze-red majesty of the cathedral dome , and Giotto 's tower  --  as ivory as Olivia Lomond . Fiesole , across the valley , was sharply defined on a hill silver-gray with olive trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet in its medieval reds and yellows and dark passageways , it seems older , as in New England a moldering gingerbread mansion of 1875 seems more venerable than a severe white parsonage of 1675 " I 'll do it . I 'll stay . I 'll hunt for Michelozzos , not mallards ! " said Hayden . Dr. Olivia Lomond was at Nat Friar 's modest tea , frowning and duskily beautiful in her plain brown dress  --  that is , all of her was there except her heart and soul and manners . But Hayden was diverted by the presence of Nat 's prim and aged sweetheart , Mrs. Shaliston Baker , whose unbubbling fount had been Boston . She was as small and quiet as a sparrow that has been discreetly reared in the Harvard Yard , and she wore her grandmother 's cameo brooch . She spoke exquisite Italian , even if her English did smack a little of flapping codfish tails and the clatter of leadfoilin chests for China tea . She belonged to the Dante Society , which meets to discuss the longing of Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravenna . It is an up-todatetopic , and has been so since 1320 . Every Sunday for a fifth of a century , these reserved lovers , Ada Baker and Nat , had had tea together . Nat gave them food as noble as the Samuel Dodsworths ' , and Hayden guessed that he would by considerable omission in his own meals make up for this fedora cake , which is the Florentinespecialty , with chocolate and whipped cream on it , and for the hot American toast , the honey from Monte Rosa , the tea and blackberry jam and ginger from London . There were peacefulness and chatter . Nat chronicled his search for a lost altarpiece of Guiduccio Palmerucci through lofty , wind-raked hill towns of Umbria ; a tale of sleeping on stone floors , living on bread and olives , and finding that one village was gaily planning to beat him to death as a tax-spy from Rome . Hayden suspected that Nat 's confession of being unablep62to buy shoelaces in Italian had been a great and gentlemanly lie , and that the old fraud could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Neapolitan taxi-driver 's . As the talk passed to Dr. Lomond , hers was no glimpse of romanticespionage in mountain passes at twilight , but a complaintabout the dusty-eyed , head-cracking drudgery of pawing over a thousand papers in her present investigation of the maternalsource of Duke Alessandro de ' Medici  --  the one who was so wholesomely murdered in 1537 . The Duke 's mother , sighed Dr. Lomond , did not seem to have been a lady of doubtful virtue . She just did n't have any virtue to be doubtful about . From both of these hygienic ghouls Hayden had clues to an erudition which should not be a smart assemblage of facts to equip a man who should have been an auctioneer or a traincallerto " get a Ph.D . " , nor a putting on of spangled intellectual costumes to impress the dullards , nor a job , nor a gentlemanly way of passing the time , but a gently ruthless , secretly panting , rival-murdering hunt for the facts which are the bones of truth ; an unremitting war in which your quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been historic facts for five hundred years . Such scholarship he had never beheld in Newlife , and even in Amherst College and in his school of architecture , it had been rare , and not considered quite well bred , nor useful for grabbing a Full Professorship . When Jesse Bradbin went in his swift automobile on a sightseeingtour , Jesse explained , " Ah , what the hell , you do n't want to learn too doggone much about all these Beauty Spots and Points of Interest . Just give ' em the once-over and see what they 're like and be able to say you 've been there . When I 'm on ap63tower , if I ca n't kill five hundred miles a day , I figure I 'm wastingmy time , and if my wife hollers about missing the scenery , I tell her , Oh , we 'll catch that on the way back  --  maybe ! ' " That philosophy of Bradbin , pompously offered at the country-clubbar as something new and valuable , caused no riots or harsh cries of offended dignity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the Ranchers and Silver National Bank . The tyro Hayden was as moved . It was not with hostility or with a flirtatiousness that winked to itself that he petitioned Dr. Lomond , as they tramped together from Nat 's down to the tramline , " I wish you 'd do me the favor of having dinner with me this evening , if you are free . " " I do n't know  --  uh  --  Mister  --  Chart ? I 'm not sure I can .... " He was sick of all his meekness . " Then you know damn well you can ! Come on ! " " But I would prefer ... " " If you 're one of these independent females that insist on payingtheir own share , I do n't mind . We can go dutch . " " I do n't insist on anything of the kind ! I 'm delighted to find a man who will buy me a dinner ! I 'm lucky when I 'm out with some wistful young male student  --  so sensitive and clever  --  and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gallantry , but lone lady grinds do n't often get invited to dinner . " " Not even when they 're beautiful ? " " Not even when they 're very beautiful ! " With that , she surprisingly smiled at him , and looked nearly human . " Where shall we go ? " he asked . " Let 's see  --  maybe Oliviero 's or the Paoli or Nandina 's . Nandina'sis light and bright and quiet and great food . Usually ,  |p64when  I do n't mournfully stay at my pensione for dinner , I get taken to one of these frantic student hang-outs , the kind they call Bohemian , ' which means noisy and not very clean , tables elbowto-elbow , filled with American G.I. graduate students and Belgianpainters and White Russians whose only profession is beingWhite Russians and English ladies whose only profession is living in small villas back of other villas . They 're all so poor . I hate poor people ! I 'm so poor myself ! " " Those  --  uh  --  Bohemian restaurants sound pretty interesting , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nandina 's to-night . " He so far reverted to the meekness which he had sworn to forswearas to chuck masculine pride and ask her to do the orderingof dinner . While she rattled the menu , he was fixed on Dr. Olivia Lomond ; he saw that at her neck and the wrists of her sexless workaday brown dress were little edgings of fine Burano lace , somehow touching . Her hands were not small . They had the untiring competence of a workman , of a peasant , but they were extraordinarily smooth , and there was an anxious gesture toward feminineness in the two small ruby rings that betrayed her strong fingers . And he noticed that her nails were slightly tinted now . They had not been so at the Dodsworths ' . Had she put this on for the tea-party  --  for him ? But his feeling that there might be ardor buried in her was killed by her mechanical questions , neither liking him enough to rejoice in his presence nor yet fearing him enough to be at all wary with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study Florence ? "  | " No  --  just wandered around , you know , walked ' round . " " Anything you 've especially liked ? " " No  --  oh , lot of different things . " And they fell silent and looked at a family birthday party at a table across the room . There was about the family nothing of the faded gold of aristocracy nor yet of the " quaint and picturesque natives " for whom the three-day tripper seeks . They were all volubly Italian , but in look and dress the father might have been a businessman of London or Glasgow or Pittsburgh . He was the type of tall , busy and competent engineer or salesman who was trying to rebuild Italy after two wars and two million foreigntourists . His wife would have seemed normal in Stockholm or Des Moines . But in their exuberant family affection they did differ from the couples whom Hayden knew . And the grandmotherlaughed in secret intimacy with the youngest child ; the middle-sized small boy burlesqued his bachelor uncle 's flourishingway of eating an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Families ! They seem to exist here , still , " wondered Hayden . " And they did all through Italian history . A brother would either murder his brother  --  which , I suppose , may be one way of showing keen domestic interest  --  or else he would go out to a neighboring tower and murder a rival family there , to keep his brother in the Council . All Italian history is made up of layers of families . " Hayden complained , " Seems to me that at home the children consider the house just a free inn and rental garage . And we older deserters : I have two sisters and a brother who live in four different states and do n't see one another twice in a decade , andp66I have three nephews  --  no , four it is now , I guess  --  that I 've never seen at all ! " Dr. Lomond sounded regretful , her cold independence betrayedby memory . " Sometimes I 've thought I 'd like to be the founder of a family , like those grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , maybe , one would never be lonely . " " Ah ! You get lonely here , too ! " She abruptly cloaked her wistfulness again , and said sharply , " Never ! Not now , I mean . " " Did n't you a little when you first came to Europe ? " She studied her forkful of long ivory-colored strands of tagliatelli ; she seemed shyly to be remembering the girl student that had been , and she answered with some March-morning warmth in her voice : " I 'm afraid T was , first . I would tell myself that I was a trained traveler . Had n't I gone way off to graduate school at Columbia , with mother 's lunch , deviled-ham sandwiches and hard-boiled eggs , in a shoebox ? And in Europe  --  oh , I could n't get lonely , all this to see , and I had plenty of resources in myself ; I could read and think , could n't I ? Not like girls who had to have flattery from slobbering men all the while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioned to loneliness in my first year of teaching at Winnemac ; I just corrected papers there and took long walks . " So I surely could n't be anything but cheerful in the panorama of Europe . But I was lonely in Paris , I was lonely in Rome , and when I first came to Florence , nearly two years ago . . . I 'm not impressed by these celebrated lonely prisoners who made a pet of a rat . I made a pet of a housefly. "  | " But you ca n't ! " " I did ! " " How could you tell . . . ? ' " There was only one in my room  --  winter it was , too cold for flies , but this one , really , he was the bravest , most clever little fly . His name was Nicky . " " How did you know ? " " He told me so . " " Of course . " " The minute I 'd come back to my room from the library and take off my jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barking a welcome in some infinitesimal way . Nights , he slept on the hot-water tap , always . He never touched my breakfast till I had finished it ; just walk on the rim of the tray and look at the pot of honey . He would take walks on my hand without tickling me  --  quite the most refined fly in Florence  --  and the only person here that I knew well , till I met Professor Friar . Do n't you call that a loneliness of distinction  --  to be ecstatic over a housefly ? " " Yes , that 's big league . What happened to Nicky ? " " He passed away . From pneumonia . He is now buried , though without a tombstone , in a volume of Mirandola manuscriptletters in the Laurentian Library . " " I understand him , slightly , " said Hayden . " When I first went off to college , there was an imitation oriental rug in my room , and because I was too scared to find one single happy thing to do , the first four-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurredto me that one of the figures in it was like a dancing girl , young and gay , with whirling ballet skirts and gold stockings  --  darling , rather small face , excited and innocent . " Her imaginary smile kept me alive all that first week in col/lege . The next fall , she had vanished , sold along with her rug , to some sordid flesh-dealer . But last night , here at my hotel , when I was drearily thinking that , after all , I might drift on to Rome , I saw her again in my bedroom rug : dancing in a different show now , very different costume , silly costume , feather boa and a huge muff and a lively little pillbox cap , but there she was , cheering me again , bidding me stay here , for she would comfortme . . . . Seventeen years later ! " " I would not have supposed you were so imaginative , Mr. Chart . " " Why not ? " ( A little huffily . ) " No reason .

" " Is that a rise ? Well , my wife is dead , I have no children , and only very casual friends , and my partner in architecture  --  at least by preference he would not be an architect at all but a salesmanand a penny-grinder : Jesse Bradbin  --  he 's an illiterate , and yet I like him and admire him and his wife , Mary Eliza , better than anybody else in Newlife .

That must be one of the great pleas of religion : that if a man has n't a precious soul behind all this unchanging blankness , then he 's a pretty shabby animal !

It was just the intrusion of a lonely pilgrim who considers you splendid and somewhat intimidating . You 'll forgive me , Olivia ? I 'm so harmless  --  disgustinglyso ! " " It 's all right .

But there are men who do read it . " " Oh  --  men ! Lumbering , lecherous , jocular animals !

With their grimaces that are supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their itch for sly conquest . Men ! My dear Mr. Chart ! My innocent Hayden ! " No . She was detestable.  |p72O  . She was little likely to be an intimate of his , he thought as they finished dinner . He had that chilled feeling , familiar even to so unflirtatious a man , of finding a pretty girl at a party , finding her warm and fetching , then having her , for no evident reason , turn into a stranger . But he still admired Olivia 's assured tautness and a moving strength in her that was fantastically different from the swishing excitements of an Art Appreciation Class . When he was with her he felt that it would not be an effeminate hobby but solid work for a man to stay here  --  for a while  --  and labor to understand the strangely flowering beauty of the Middle Ages . He would bathe in the magic and perilous waters of medieval history : proud-colored , hot , heroic , vicious knights in armor that had been decorated by voluptuous goldsmiths , dungeons and silent convents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lost in an enchantment of which he did not understandeven the vocabulary . If only he could be guided through this wizardry by Olivia , whose hands lay still on the table , hands not thin and meanly de/sirous but arrogant , ivory in every line carved to loveliness . The hollow between her thumb and forefinger was a polished curve . They were hands that could grasp and hold , and they excitedhim even while he was talking prosily : " If I stay here , I 'd like to get a sort of permanent place cheaper than the big hotels . Have you any ideas ? " " The pensione I 'm living in , the Tre Corone , is all right . The furniture is simple and the food is good and  --  this interests a professional romanticist like myself  --  it occupies two floors of one of the oldest Florentine houses , the Palazzo Spizzi . " To invite him , or at least permit him , to be near to her , near to her ivory hands , her lips that were dark-red in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till he reflected that she was probably so indifferent to him that she did not care whether he lived next door or in Novaya Zemlya . Nor did she mention the pensione again , as they finished dinnerand tramped to the Spizzi . But next day he was busily inspectingit . A palazzo in Italy signifies only a large house , usually of stone , built a few hundred years ago for a very rich and very noble family who became very rich and noble by conducting a war , with a large cut in the pillage , or by lending money to popes and kings and dukes who conducted wars . These houses are lordly , rivaled today only by movie theaters . In Florence , the Palazzo Spizzi , on the Lungarno not far from the Ponte Vecchio , is one of the lordliest , with granite walls in rough rustica . There are surly , prison-barred windows on the ground floor , but on the four floors above , elegant Gothic windows with stone tracery . Along the street are bronze torch-holders , and rings forp74tethering the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long stone bench on which once lounged the armed servantsof the magnate , waiting for commands which might mean fun or death , and probably both . You go through an arched gateway into an arcaded central court , with high-colored heraldic shields and one sacred fresco on the smooth stone walls . The court and its little statues of lyric fauns are dominated by a vast stone stairway . Here , the Medici hurried , and the Pazzi , Bardi , Rucellai , Cavalcanti . One of them , one day , walked in white carnival satin that suddenly , here on this green-molded spot , became streakily variegatedwith red , as the expert assassin from Forli slid in his dagger . And over there , most briefly afterward , the assassin had his toes lightly toasted before his head was jaggedly hacked off . In this niche of crimson and gold and crocus-colored mosaic , a Spizzi garroted his ardent bride . It is now a rented storage space for bicycles . Since 1550 , even Florence has changed . Today , the doors along the arcade give on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tearoom kept by an old English lady , an embroideryshop kept by an even older Scotch lady , and a ferocious left-wing hook shop kept by two young Welsh ladies who play piano duets and admire Jacob Epstein and drink nothing but vodka and diuretic mineral water . You pant up the stairs to the offices of machinery agents and of buyers representing stores in Dallas , Montreal and Oslo . The two floors above these constitute the Pensione Tre Corone , and up to it climbed Hayden Chart . It was a racking ascension , but Hayden felt strong and fresh , his accident healed over . In a standard pensione hallway of green rep walls , a reed chairp75and a mummied palm , a door painted with ferocious roses was opened for him by an extremely handsome Italian young man wearing the man-about-Florence standard uniform of wavy black hair , cigarette , checkered brown-and-gray sports jacket and gray slacks . Hayden did not at all care for the thought of this jazz satyr living in the house with Olivia , and he was relievedat the coming of Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active Italian widow who had married a Birmingham traveling salesman and lived for years in England . She spoke English like an A.B.C . teashop waitress , a refined duchess , a Cardiff coal miner and a Tuscan peasant , all at once . " Oh , yes , we have a very nice room with a love-ely view of the Duomo and the Santa Annunziata and Fiesole and everything and a private bath  --  ooh , just like home . But you 're not English , are you ? " " I 'm an American . " " Ow . . . Well , we quite like Americans here  --  the better class . You are not married ? " " No . " " But then , you 're not the wild sort that would want to be entertaining  --  uh  --  people in your room , and I 'm sure you will want full pensione . " " What is that ? " " Both luncheon and dinner here daily . It 's so much more satisfactory , you know , to have your meals here , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants . Res-taurants ! And not knowing what you 're getting and the pasta stale and the veal tough and no pure Chianti , such as we serve . Mrs. Engineer Purdy , one of our very oldest guests , often says to me , Signora , I simply do not understand how you can afford top76serve such love-ely pure unmixed Chianti at the shockingly low price we pay here ! ' And of course she knows ! So shall we say full pensione ? " " No , I plan to take at least one meal a day out . " " It 's a mistake , but of course I never even give advice to my gentlemen but it 's a mistake and quite hard on me , with such love-ely clean rooms and serving such a variety of food and the butter always fresh , at such shockingly low prices as you pay , but shall we say half-pensione then ? " They would say that , yes , with luncheon taken here , Hayden agreed , proud of being so businesslike in securing his first Italian home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low prices . He was dazed by the Anglo-Italian verbal hemorrhageand yet he felt secure . He had lived with Mrs. Manse , underdifferent names and accents , in Newlife , Amherst , Denver , New York , London , and he knew that he would be cheated only the correct proportion . " And when you arc not able to he here for colazione , will you kindly let me know twenty-four hours beforehand ? So many gentlemen are thoughtless about that , " said Mrs. Manse . She introduced him to a bedroom , smallish , square , with blank plaster walls , which yet delighted him , for the one window was Gothic-pointed and the ceiling was groined . It had surely been part of some greater salon in the early palace , or perhaps of a chapel , and the clean bareness of it was proper for the studious monk he meant to become . The varnished yellow pine bed was narrow , not bad ; there was a large white wardrobe for clothes , a large white table for the notes on Italian history that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would certainly buy and possibly even read . There was a hideous but comfortable yellow-velvet armchair with a fiddle-shaped back , a straight chair , a pinched radiator , and a composition stone floor , with a rug beside the bed ... . But he looked unsuccessfully for his dancing girl in the rug . The bathroom was little larger than the ancient tub , but it was adequate , and even contained articles which seemed to Hayden somewhat perplexing and certainly of great superfluousness . One of these was a bootjack . He had ridden horses in the Berkshire Hills , on dude ranches , on the cheery camping journeys through the Rockies on which Caprice had been both at her most complainingand her most recklessly gay , but he did not think it likely that he would ride a Western pony up to the Palazzo Spizzi and tether it to one of the great bronze rings below . The place seemed to him almost voluptuous when Mrs. Manse explained that only one bedroom in three at the Tre Corone had its private bath . What starred his room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and the vista of towers and fourteenth-century battlements and , down below , the humblerroofs of tiles , cherry-colored , soft rose , violent crimson or pale orange , above yellow-plaster walls . A top-floor tenement down there  --  it was , he learned afterwards , above a groundfloorleather shop full of gold-tooled purses and small jewel boxes  --  had an open loggia and a terrace with geraniums and with goldfinches in cages , and a broad-sterned woman was hangingout a hot red shirt to dry . He would be seeing real Florentines , and not just palace walls , spacious but decaying.  |p78Mrs  . Manse , that unlaureated mistress of psychology , knew that . he would take this room . She knew ! When he did , at last , remember to confer delicately about the price , he was so under the spell that she overcharged him grossly : she charged him at least one-half as much as such a cell would have cost in America . He did not quite dare to ask how near to his own door was that of Dr. Olivia Lomond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round a corner of the matting-covered stone corridor . All this was on the upper floor of the pensione . On the floor below were still more bedrooms  --  there were twenty-eight in all  --  with the office , the dining room , the lounge . The dining room was simple and white and cheerful , with white-clothed tables for one or two or four , each of them with coquettish napkin rings and a tight bouquet of asters and , usually , a Chianti bottle . The serving-table  --  the credenza  --  had once been an overgorgeousdrawing-room table of marquetry with gilded metal edges . The lounge must have been a great salon of the ferocious and devoutly pious Spizzi family : lofty , vaulted , cold . Around somewhatdreary damask-covered tables , displaying Italian motoring magazines , were modern chairs artfully but unhappily devised of twisted red-stained wood , or aged refugee chairs from destroyedparlors , resembling indigent gentlewomen . There was a case of novels and travel books which fleeing guests had intelligentlyleft behind : a French guidebook to Sicily dated 1899 and such romances as Lively Lassie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this clean shabbiness you could rest familiarly enough , and the lounge windows looked down on the Ponte Vecchio , that venerable bridge of shops devoted now to sellers of artificialp79pearls and not to Donati defending the crossing with loud swords . Late that afternoon , with small trunk and ill-assorted bags and a hastily purchased new blue-silk cravat , Hayden moved into his cell at the Tre Corone . He met his floor maid , Perpetua , a smiling , black-eyed , powerfulwoman of fifty , only just slightly felonious , who would also be his waitress , valet , chamberlain , social arbiter , and chief professor in the Italian tongue : a low-built peasant in black dress and white apron who seemed to be on duty from five A.M. to midnight . Shyly , not knowing how he should dress , he went down to his first dinner , at eight , to risotto and boiled beef , and met most of the Tre Corone guests . They too were in lounge clothes . In treachery to all tradition , there was no retired British colonel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He encountered , instead , a Hungarian widow of fifty and her daughter , highly polylingual and undevoted to Bolsheviks , a round-faced American graduate student who listened to and sometimes understood lectures on Italian art at the university , an out-of-favor Italian ex-diplomat , a Dutch baron devoted to cameos , to Americans and other novelties , an Italian lawyer with three daughters , a soured French silk-buyer , and an ItaloAmericanagent for documentary films , who wanted to discuss trout-fishing in Maine with Hayden . Dr. Lomond  --  Olivia  --  sat by herself at a small table and read the air-mail continental Time . She looked at Hayden twice beforeshe remembered him ( that is what she thought he would think ) and she nodded and said nothing and went back to read/ing about Congressman Marcantonio , the latest biography of Susan B. Anthony , murder by a balding man late at night in a rubber-boot warehouse , revolution in the Celebes , the mortality rate in successor-disease affecting former confidants of Stalin , **28;5624;TOOLONG in the University of Leyden , and the other brighter topics of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Time cover , portraying , in color , a fabulous chain-store organizer , with a background of prunes , motorcycles , cash registers and bathing caps , and instead of Olivia 's glass-smooth cheeks or hostile , inquiring eyes , Hayden studied only his plate of saffron-yellow rice.  |p81U  T of his plastered cell , Hayden made a cluttered and familiar home . It was , possibly , the first home he had ever had . In boyhood , " home " had been aggressively his father 's house , and in his marriage , their three successive houses had been saturated with Caprice and her clamorous friends . In a second-hand shop he bought a couple of low tables , a small rosy armchair and a shaky set of bookshelves that had been used for bottles . At Alinari 's he got color prints of the Primavera and Angelico 's Great Crucifixion and the fairyland of Benozzo Gozzoli 's gold and crimson courtier pilgrims . In the book shops he went on a spree . He bought histories of Florence in English , English-Italian grammars and dictionaries , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had books which he certainly would not be able to tackle for two years : Dante and Petrarch , Manzoni 's classic 1 Promessi Sposi , which is written in hedgerows and not in lines , Machiavelli 's Prince , and a volume of Giovanni Villani 's Florentinehistory  --  a brand-new edition , dated 1650 . He had , in fact , all of a university except the yell and the bursar 's office.  |p82His  exploration of Florence , begun immediately , was not altogetherthat of the enraptured and credulous tourist , for Hayden Chart was an architect , a good one , not unlearned , and he saw the purposes of arches and buttresses ; his eye picked up ornamental iron balconies and in apparent mere gaps between buildings he detected minute streets leading to some lost square with a little church , an old , very old , very holy church sheltering the tomb of a spacious Platonist who in 1492 was discovering the old world as dangerously as Columbus was finding the new . He went graspingly at learning Italian , a tongue reputed among the untutored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice-cream cries , but actually so thorny with perverse irregular verbs and pronouns that have more exceptions than rules and suffixes meaning Big , Pretty Big , Very Big , EnormouslyBig , Little , Delightfully Little , Nasty , or Perfectly Horriblethat most tenderfoot students give it up , moaning , after learning how to make love and order a meal . He looked into the official Italian Language course at the University , but it was all in Italian from the first , too much for the halting brain of thirty-five . He tried a School of Languages , but he did not feel stimulated by his fellow-students : AngloAmericanwomen who , after housekeeping in Florence for a decade , had decided that it was time to find out what they had really been eating all these years , or English businessmen who wanted to sell British machinery , or the aunts of American EuropeanRelief Program officials , all of whom interrupted the lessonsto explain what they thought about Italy , with an urgency which indicated that they believed the natives , from doperunnersto the President , were pantingly waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Signora Pendola , an oldish fat widow with an umbrella and elastic-sided shoes , afflicted with bronchitis and sadness of the heart , tired , so poor and tired , but a patient teacher , with a voice like Eleonora Duse . Hayden was fond of her and treated her as though she were his mother . Before each lesson , down in the salon , he had the waiter bring the Signora a cup of tea , and she announced that he was the kindest American since that born Yankee hustler , Julius Caesar . Along with her instruction , he daily studied his book of grammar , but this seemed to be another Italian . Rarely did any of the words which he painfully drilled into himself from the printed lists slip over into normal conversation . As he learned each phrase from the Signora , Hayden tried it out on the maid , Perpetua , who , being Italian and generous , did not find it funny when he meant to ask her to sew on a button , but gravely made it , " By favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He tried his new words in shops , in small restaurants . The friendly Florentines were pleased that the stranger should want to know their tongue , and he began to love the gently grave men , the flexibly moving women . He had thought , at first , that the Italian women had noses too long from the nasal standard of American magazine-cover girls  --  but presently he was convinced that these almost long noses were part of a medieval grace and long flying lines that ought to be seen not in the chopped-off smart New York styles which prosperous Italian women wear today , but in a fluency of trailing silk , soft green trimmed with silver and rare furs . He noted with comfort that Olivia Lomond 's nose was one onehundredthof an inch longer than the severe Colorado norm ,  |p84and  he felt that if he should ever see Roxanna Eldritch 's pert snub nose again he would consider it truncated and vulgar . As rudely as though he were flagrantly picking her up at a railroad station , he tackled Olivia at her icy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She consented indifferently , and as they tramped together , squeezed close by the exigencyof a two-man-wide alley , they still seemed as far apart as at the pensione . He worked hard then , as young men of thirtyfiveor eighty-five do , to convince her that he was a devilish clever fellow . She might know all about the bellicose families who once had fought from these rough towers , but he could tell her what foundation a tower must have and how much it taperedand what the square holes in the walls were for . She came to treat him as being almost as decent and capable a human being as Perpetua . She did not mock him  --  much . With Olivia or by himself he looked at the great churches  --  Or San Michele , Miniato , Santa Croce , Maria Novella , San Marco , the Battistcro  --  and at the galleries till he understood how a Giotto differed from a Spinello Aretino . He began , a little , to follow the symbolism whereby a pictured saint portrayed both the saint and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that a picture in which the misdrawn toes were as long as fingers and the children were only dwarf grown-ups could yet in the whole composition hold ecstasy and delight . But he also discovered that the one place colder than his own room at two A. M. was any Italian church , north of Naples , at ten A. M. on a February day . The rosiest Madonna looked bluefrozenas the malicious air crept up from a crypt that had grown colder , winter by winter , for centuries . He admired the fortitudep85of the Italians : beardster and babies cheerful at Mass while he fled outdoors to get warm . And he found the smoochers  --  he worked out the Doctrine of Smoochers . Smoochers  --  the word was Hayden 's own ; first blooming of his Florentine poetic revelations  --  are those shaggy and lumberingmen who in a church or a ruined palace or a public square pop out of a vacuum , guides and sextons and loafers and plain floor-sweepers , who with hazy but persistent firmness wreck and ruin and shatter the still raptness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , a Ghirlandaio by telling you that , remarkably enough , it is a church or a Ghirlandaio . You knew it already . That is why you went there . The English spoken by smoochers lacks not only verbs but adjectives and they good-naturedly date Simone Martini as anywherefrom 1140 to 1760 . But if you are sorry for them as being needy , you can usually persuade them to let you alone by instantlyinsulting them with a fifty-lire note . Subdivisions of the smoochers , indoors and out , include insistentpost-card sellers , sellers of bead necklaces and of fountainpens , and would-be changers of dollar bills . In the great churches , he thought often of how Jesse Bradbin would have snorted , " But what 's the practical use of all this old art ? " And in imaginary answer he insisted that it seemed to him improbable that one who had much contemplated Or San Michele or a Botticelli would willingly allow himself or any one else to become just a file number in a bureaucracy such as Russia now is and America and Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where rests Elizabeth Barrett Browning , and such little-altered medieval quarters as the toy Piazzetta Elisabetta , he paid suit to modern Florence : to some dozen restaurants , to shops for silver and china and lace and gold-embossed leather , and to the county-family pleasantnessof the Anglo-American Pharmacy , and he studied the tribal rites of the resident Americans at Doney 's and Leland 's , the tearoombars , to which go equally the more dependable drunks and the crisp American girls being finished off in finishing schools , who believe that to see Inside Italy means to go downtownand have pastry with whipped cream . The American Colony is divided into three parts : those who have their cocktails at Leland 's or Doney 's , a small sect who have them at home , either with firelight and old silver and a butler and many guests or , by the good tradition of Bohemian poverty , with boxes to sit on round the kitchen stove and the drinks mixed in a broken-nosed pitcher , and the third part , a tiny and suspect group , which does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Americano , that mixtureof vermouth and kindness of which no American ever hears till he conics to Italy . A Florentine might have pointed out to Hayden that in defininga city of palaces and paintings and bars , he was missing nine-tenths of the living community : a post-war world of workers jobless or anxious in hospitals , small officials with meat once a month and wine at Christmas , repressed but angry citizenshating the well-fed foreigners who came brightly to gloat over a Filippo Lippi Madonna and never learned that a descendantof Filippo was hauling garbage . But Hayden understood allp87of this . Even in new Newlife he had built tenements . He was more moved by poverty among American students here . He met American girl students whose life here was a storm of frustration , between a passion to stay in Florence and apprehensionthat it would keep them from going on to see the rest of Italy  --  Rome , Milan , Turin ; a passion to remain in Italy and fear that they were becoming unfitted for the ways , the friends , back home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they only had enough money to move flexibly , and he a little despised such burghers as himself and the Dodsworths , who were so amiably and pointlessly advisory to the shabby students . The most exhilarating part of his new life was in his quiet room at the Tre Corone , finding himself . It was a secret life , a life that he hugged to him . In studious solitude he saw winter pass like blown smoke . Half the night he sat up trying to read medieval history in the Italian of Villani , of Guicciardini , and meditating upon the meaning , to himself and to his day , of that world of authority , ceremony , color , and enchanting but just slightly cockeyed fables . To rest his eyes he had , on his portable radio , Mozart from Milan . He read on nightly , till he felt uncomfortable and was dismayedto find that his room was slush-cold . The Florentine winter lasts only from mid-December to March , and in that season there are luminous days , but there are also jeeringly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastatingly down from the Alps three pinched days at a spell , blowing pitilessly , playing rowdy with the tiles and shutters ,  |p88chasing  the night policemen down the streets and into bicyclestoragealcoves , marching through Hayden 's northward-facing window as though it were a paper screen . In the trcimontana 's shriek of an ice-tortured fiend , Hayden thought he could catch a stated tune : rising , rising , rising to a scream , a sullen sinking down again , and rising , rising . By day , he could see the olive tree on a terrace below him turn altogether silver , with its sheet of leaves so lifted by the gale that he saw only the undersides , while a cypress tree bent over in twisting pain . The tempest seemed worst during the fits of grudging sunshine when , afar , he could see the aloof and whitened peaks of the Pistoia Mountains coldly leering at this uncouth stranger who once had talked of " sunny Italy . " Mrs. Manse let her radiators go cold before midnight , and at one in the morning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pallid walls and glistening stone floor . Cold was in his eyeballs , in his chest , and his breath was coldly vaporous . He understood why beggars , hopeless at night on winter doorsteps , crouched themselves together . He had had words with Mrs. Manse about an electric heater , and had bought one for himself : a good little Italian electric stove composed of two sheets of glass with wires between . It glowed obedience to its scholar-master , but it could not do much more than keep itself warm and , impatiently determined to go on reading , I layden huddled his overcoat and scarf over his woolen dressing-gown and , to crown this costume of a lone miser , he put on his polite brown hat . His immensest luxury was a cup-size Italian aluminum stove with sticks of Meta compound for fuel , and pulverized instant coffee . Nearly warmed by his coffee , he thought of what hep89had been reading : Lodovico it Moro , taking his nephew 's throne in Milan , playing gaudy host and patron to religious painters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fairest and most febrile youth of the Renaissance , learning Greek , Hebrew , Arabic , challenging the College of Cardinals , and dying at thirty-one , to be buried over here in the cold gloom of San Marco . It was all magic . With pleasant recognition he found himself and his vigils in Il Penseroso when he picked up some English poetry on a book barrow on the Piazza D'Avanzati . The nightbewitchedscholar , timeless and immortal , from a Colorado boomtown of 1950 or from the Florence of 1490 , Hayden or Count Pico , all of them in all their shabby majesty he found as he read Milton 's " lamp at midnight hour , seen in some high lonely tower , " where the hermit sought " forests and enchantments drear , where more is meant than meets the ear . " Mrs. Dodsworth examined him , woman-wise , when he went to the Villa Canterbury to play bridge . " Have you got yourself a girl yet ? " " None in sight . " " What about Miss Lomond  --  this prof essoressa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santayana . " " What do you do with yourself ? You ca n't spend all your time sightseeing . " " I tinker with Italian maps  --  try to find the best route to forests and enchantments drear . " " You 're very young , Hayden  --  pleasantly so . " " Or very old , and repentant of a wasted life in which the only poetry I ever learned was Yes , we have no bananas . ' I think I ought to tell the press services to send out a story that ap90man can read poetry without getting kicked out of the AthleticClub . " " I doubt that ! I 've been in Zenith ! " With the other guests  --  but privately he thought of them as " the boarders "  --  at the Tre Corone , he had after-dinner coffee , and they all asked " Have you seen the Bargello ? " He went to Nat Friar 's again and found him reading an Eric Ambler thriller . Nat said he was rather off Great Books , since the Universityof Chicago had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juveniles 7-II , Great Book neckties and Great Book Bran Brainfood for Breakfast . And he had a night-club evening with Vito Zenzero , the wavyblack-haireddancing man , nephew of Mrs. Manse , who was the pensione 's desk-clerk , head waiter and entertainer of spinsters . Vito spoke energetic English , learned from the less refined members of the American Expeditionary Forces , and he took Hayden to a hot spot in a thick-walled basement under an old palace . Hayden had noted that Olivia was blank to Vito when , looking like the best of 13 films in his yellow-green jacket and brown slacks , he teetered and tittered about the dining room , encouragingthe guests to buy Frascati wines . " Why arc you so cranky ? Poor Vito , he flowers in the sunshine . " I layden desired to know of Olivia . " Poor Vito flowers in manure ! He sells black-market cigarettes and gets a commission on all the guests whom he coaxes to take him to night clubs .... " " Oh ! " " ... and he 's seduced every girl in this district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a real medieval character . Youp91like them only in books , Olivia . If you 'd been in Italy in 1400 , you 'd have fled to Ireland and a nunnery . " " Oh , pooh ! " she said , not very convincingly . This evening , Hayden had , without any noticeable invitation , firmly sat down at her table for coffee . Her manner toward him still had the persistent grayness of a trainontana , and this admirablystrong-willed woman was apparently able to keep it up forever . More with a collector 's curiosity than with any sympathyshe asked , " What are you studying ' now , Hayden ? " " I 'm trying to get into Dante , with a trot . " " You really are naive ! " " It 's you that are naive , in not understanding that I 'm having an adventure . For me it 's as novel to try to wallow through Dante as it would be for you to plan a modern low-price bathroomwith compartments  --  plastic and stainless steel  --  green and silver . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom  --  with compartments  --  norto use one , either ! " He thought about slapping her . He told himself that , with this conceited grind , there was no merit in even a boardinghousecourtesy . He left her gruffly , and it was an astonishment to him , a week later , when she invited him to take her to the Camillo for dinner . That brisk restaurant , across the river in the Oltrarno quarter , on the Borgo San Jacopo with its ancient walls , is a favorite of the scores of American students in Florence , and of students German , French , Swedish , Burmese . A few of them had learned Italian and had actually met an Italian , but most of them were as innocently detached from the local life as were their financial betters , the Colonists . They met nightly in zealously argumenta/tive groups devoted to the prose of Henry Miller and the pastoraldelights of Marxism , while they let down their fettuccine noodles and drank carafes of vino rosso sciolto . At most Florentine restaurants , eight o'clock is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camillo every table is full by a quarter to eight , and by eight-fifteen , Picasso and Existentialismhave already been mentioned , which means another regrettablenight up till two-thirty , at Danny 's or Rachel 's " studio , " and the head like a tornado in the morning and the Sforzas not yet studied . Olivia had always the art of making Hayden feel wizened and uncertain , but she had never been so authoritative as at the Camillo , where all the students recognized her , perhaps feared her a little , and called her " Doctor " or " Professor . " They wanted to know what she thought of the Della Robbias , and she told them . . . . And with considerable comfort Hayden perceived that she had the three Robbias all mixed up , and that both she and the convivial students supposed that because she knew the legal and political history of the fifteenth century , she must be a sound taster of its art . Her insufficiency did not keep her from being confident or the students from noting down what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate future students of these students , in far-flung crepuscular colleges on the plains or in the hills  --  colleges where " far-flung " is considered a novel and forcefuladjective . When he had been permitted to take Olivia home , even that friendly pup Hayden had had enough , and he did not speak to her again for a week . Then , shatteringly , came the embarrassment in the hall.  |p93HA  Y D E N , in respectable hat and brown topcoat , had respectably come in from seeing an American film and he was thinking how odd it was to hear an actor from Ohio making love with Neapolitan ardor . He was whistling softly and unaware , and he stopped with a jar as he came full on Olivia , a negligee lacy about her breast , carrying under her silk-draped arm the intimacies of sponge-bag , soap , towel , fresh nightgown . She was astonishingly embarrassed about it . She trembled a little as she quavered , " Have to use bathroom down here  --  somebody in the other one that I often use  --  I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Really not accustomed to parading naked in the hall ! I  --  oh , excuse me  --  Mr. Chart ! " He attacked : " What 's the trouble ? What bothers you so about the nearness of a male lout ? Why are you so sufferingly virginal , Olivia ? " " I am not ! " But she was deep-flushed , and panting . " You 're abnormally so ! " " That 's silly ! I 'm not . . . . Oh , I suppose I do get startledfaunish , leading such a cloistral life here . "  |p94The  superior Dr. Lomond was defenseless . He felt brutal and bad-mannered , but she had been so stonily lofty on their eveningat the Camillo that he was not particularly kind . And in soft oriental silk she was interesting  --  at least . " Olivia , my dear , you often give me good advice about not being an amateur scholar . I ca n't resist advising you to taste a little more salty life . Come out to a night club with me . Dance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint ! " " Perhaps I  --  well , I must get on with ... " Down the hall they heard the door of Bathroom 2 closing and the running of water . He laughed . " Cut off on all sides ! Forest fire back of us , mountain lions in front ! Come sit in my room till that swine there has finished his dip . . . . It will be perfectly proper . I 'll leave my door open . Do n't be scared . " " I could not conceivably be scared by you or anybody else ! " But the hot flash of blood under her Syrian skin had faded to a rare paleness , and her voice was uneven . " I think I 'd better wait in my own room , though , thank you . " Her look had such appeal as he would never have expected from her  --  appealing , a girl , a woman  --  and she begged , " Please ! It 's kind of you , but I think Mrs. Manse still tries to convince us she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she might not care for our dormitory chat . " " Good night , my dear . Sorry the enemy captured all the baths . Good night ! " He sat thinking that she was as feminine , in a betraying cloudiness of silk , as Caprice had been ; as much the forest nymph white in the woodland twilight . But there was something wrong ; some nameless injury that she had taken . He wasp95sorry for the lofty Dr. Lomond , and with his pity came fondnessfor her . Next evening , at dinner , she looked at him with a trace of intimacy , of pleading , yet by after-dinner-coffee time she was as self-sufficient as ever , and she was noticeably rude to his friend Vito Zenzero when Vito came pussycatting around to ask , Had the professoressa enjoyed the beautiful artichokes ? Nothing seemed to have happened , nothing did happen , and Hayden was again drawn into a hobo life in the jungles of the American Colony , trying to find out how innocent these InnocentsAbroad were , and why they were abroad at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italo-American businessmen than of the golden loafers of the Colony , the Dodsworthset with their Louis Seize cabinets and chauffeurs and hospitalityto poor Colonists who were pitiful martyrs in not having chauffeurs . Many of these Colonists were content , month on month , to go to cocktail parties with amiable friends , to play a little bridge , to dine out , to read the latest books sent over from Home , to look once a month at a gallery or a church and , all in all , unknowingall , do nothing but wait for death . Hayden was not going to wait for death . He had , and not long since , been through most of its agonies , and he was going to use every energy and inspired curiosity in him to keep himself consciouslyliving , to find and cherish life in his new career , in a dozen new careers . He believed that Americans could do that , as the Founding Fathers had . In even the most languid and habitual of thep96Florentine Colonists , in even the most fluttering pansy , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle of Americansliving abroad and how very queer they are , in English country houses or Tuscan villas or flats in Rome , and how touchy they become as they contemplate the correctness of Europeans . But just how queer they are , Mr. James never knew . He never saw a radio reporter , never talked to an American Oil Company proconsul gossiping in the Via Veneto about his native Texas . Americans are electric with curiosity , and this curiosity has misled foreigners and Mr. James into crediting them with a provincialreverence which they do not possess ; a reverence which their ancestors got rid of along with their native costumes , one month after Ellis Island or after Plymouth Rock . If a queen comes to America , crowds fill the station squares , and attendant British journalists rejoice , " You see : the AmericanCousins are as respectful to Royalty as we are . " But the Americans have read of queens since babyhood . They want to see one queen , once , and if another came to town next week , with twice as handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small boys and an Anglophile . Americans want to see one movie star , one giraffe , one jet plane , one murder , but only one . They run up a skyscraper or the fame of generals and evangelists and playwrights in one week and tear them all down in an hour , and the mark of excellenceeverywhere is " under new management . " Nor are they so different when they are expatriates . After years of Europe , Sam Dodsworth was unalterably midwestern in his quick humorous glance , his scorn for social climbers , his monotonous voice , his liking for dry cereals , his belief that if hep97met a stranger and took to him , they were friends from that hour . He had the result of the annual Yale-Princeton football game cabled to him , and he amused his more Italianized wife by sometimes addressing a countess as " Missus . " And the much-younger Hayden Chart , listening to the music of ancient zithers in yellow-spotted books , planning to go on to the Spice Islands and the red-enameled gates of China , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward gray eminences or gray towers . Like Dodsworth , he thought well of American hospitals and streamlinedtrains and the reluctance of Democrats to behead all Republicans . Mr. James 's simple miss has become the young lady at the Ritz Bar , and his young American suitor , apologetic for having been reared in the rustic innocence of Harvard instead of the Byzantine courtliness of a bed-sitting-room at Oxford , has been replaced by the American flying major who in Africa , Arabia , China , Paris is used to being courted as the new Milord . Hayden found that the Florentine American Colony considereditself a community sufficient and significant . The Colonistswho had been here for forty years looked down on the settlers of ten years standing who looked down on the one-year squatters who looked down on the newcomers of one month who were extremely lofty and informative with the one-week horrors . Altogether , the Colony made up one-tenth of one per cent of the population of Florence . And the claims of none of these reversed patriots so much interestedHayden as his own secret life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ap98quite new personality among the ranches and mines of Colorado , so Hayden was developing a new personality in an equally perilousItalian world of disjunctive pronouns , Gothic triforiums , and the mystery of Olivia down the hall . As the mercenary Colleoni once attacked the fortress of a girl 's heart , so Hayden attacked the history of Colleoni and all that insane medieval j urnbleof wars and dynasties . He loved this Italy precisely because it was strange to him . In his restricted cell of a bedroom here he had but little of an exile 's longing for the luxury and space of his house in Newlife ; for the chaise longue and the shelves of detective stories and the heated garage , and the breakfast table , of glass and flowery ironwork , on the sunporch . They were overbalanced by Florence and its memory of banners and slow deep bells , of towers and swords and torture . He believed that he could go beyond the futility of merely piling up historical timber . It was easy enough for even a guidebook-tripper to learn a catalogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted out of his scant erudition to make a solid structure to rest in , to make a signboard that would point out on what road mankind had marched . With Henry Adams , he tried to see the same ornament and soaring ambition in Gothic cathedrals and Gothic hymns , the same grace and light in Renaissance palaces and villas and sculptureand song . I le sought the relationship of all his new visions to his own profession . In Florence , his favorite Newlife brick Georgian houses , with delicate fanlights and wide windows which promised welcome and wreaths and Christmas candles ( but strictly with movable partitions and oil-heating and insulated roofs ! ) , still seemed fit/ting and dear , though he did not want them in Italy . And equally from the integrity of old stone walls and from Roman classic columns he was refreshed in his belief that in no time or land have there been more imperially beautiful buildings than the towers of Rockefeller Center , in New York . In Newlife he had needed some unfamiliarity , some strangeness , and had needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that from the first two words he could predict everything else that the oracle was about to thunder . How great those needs had been he knew when he was called to the pensione office to answer the telephone , and heard a heavy American masculine chuckle : " I 'll bet you 'll never in the world guess who this is ! " " No , I 'm afraid I ca n't . " " Well , try and make a guess now . " " It is n't Mr. Dodsworth ? " " No , no , no no ! I ought to needle you a little and punish you for forgetting your old friends so easy , but I 'll put you out of your misery . It 's Bill Windelbank , from Home ! " It was indeed that excellent and intellectual dentist who , as much as Roxanna Eldritch , had summoned him to the asphodels of Europe . But Hayden thought , and was ashamed to be caught thinking it , that he did not desire to see Dr. William Windelbankat all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to Olivia , to Nat Friar , to the Dodsworths ? He disliked his own snobbishness and disloyalty , but he did not think he could ever stand hearing the Windelbanks explain to Sir Henry Belfont , self-importantly and in detail , how barbaricItaly was in not serving flapjacks and doughnuts , and insistingupon giving Belfont 's cordon bleu the recipes . Or jocu/larly saying to Nat Friar , " Prof , I hope you folks here do n't let Hay put it over on you about what a highbrow he is . Home , he just reads the comic strips and goes to bed at nine-thirty like the rest of us , but he always was a great guy for trying to show off and make like a deep reader  --  do n't you now , Hay ? " But Hayden was cordial . " Well ! Thought Jean and you were only going to stay abroad for five weeks , and here it must be over four months . Golly ! " One magic touch of Home and he was already back in its good-fellowship , its sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it certainly is ! " boasted Windelbank . " Four months , seventeen days and nine and a half hours since we sailed from little ole New York ! But right off the bat , we started seeingso doggone much and we like it , and I said to Jean , We only live once , and the food is a lot better and tastier in Europe than we expected , and we 'll never come back here  --  too many more important points of interest to cover , like Brazil and Nova Scotia . So , ' I said , ' let 's go hog-will and have four-five months here . ' " But now we 've had enough  --  plenty . The food may be delicious , hut it do n't stay by you and nourish the maxillary blood supply like a good Colorado beefsteak . So we 're finishing up the tower with two days in Florence and three in Rome , just like we originally planned . We did our two days in Venice , but do n't think too much of it : real picturesque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most of our time was Scandinavia and a lovely little lake resort we found in Northern England  --  just like home . And now  --  only two days here , Hay ! What do we do ? " In terror Hayden perceived that he was expected to spend all of those two days with the Windelbanks , providing meals ,  |p101trans|portation  , interpretage , and learned artistic guidance , answeringrapidly and with apparent accuracy all questions about the weight of the Duomo cupola , the biographies , with dates , of all the more important inhabitants of all tombs in all churches , and the number of members in all political parties in Tuscany . " Well , why not ? " he rebuked himself . " They 'd do the same for me , even if  --  especially if !  --  I did n't want them to ! " Anyway , they were too kind and loyal for him to think of dodging them , and he trumpeted , " How about my picking you up and taking you to dinner tonight ? " " Well now , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean  --  you know how finicking and suspicious women are  --  she said , Maybe Hay 's gone and gotten in with a lot of snobs here and wo n't care to see plain folks like us , ' but I says to her , Not on your life ! I know Hay 's character like I know his bicuspids ! He may talk fancy and highfalutin , but at heart he 'll always be just a plain , back-slappin ' Western boy , like all the rest of us ! ' " As punishment for his sin of alienation , Hayden found , at dinner , that Dr. Windelbank had noticed many things that he , in the same islands of bliss , had never marked : the routes of the Paris Metro , the wages of bellboys in Belgium , the horsepower of London taxicabs . The doctor was buoyant about his discoveries ; he made Hayden feel aged and juiceless , as Sam Dodsworth made him feel credulous and boisterous and infantile . Dinner was comfortable  --  and Jean Windelbank 's new gray dinner dress was excellent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Windelbanks , who had assiduously corresponded with everybody back home , the more salient items of news : that Mary Eliza Bradbin 's new upperp102plate took all the wrinkles away from around her mouth , that Dr. Crittenham had bought a " new Chevvy , a swell two-tonecolorjob , " that Bobby Tregusis , the nephew of Chan Millward 's first wife 's first husband , had a lovely job with the Cripple Creek telephone company . And in Paris the Windelbanks had seen Roxanna Eldritch . " I phoned her  --  she could n't guess who it was , at first , but then she was real glad to hear my voice  --  I 'll bet she was ; kid like that so far away from home among these queer foreigners and all these moral pitfalls .

" and then I said to her , ' But I 'm willing to go on record as saying that never even in America have 1 tasted a nicer kidney ! ' " Well , sir , 1 said to Roxy , I hope you 're the same sweet , fresh , unspoiled young lady you always was at home , even among all those reporters and politicians , and she said to me , Dr. Bill , no girl can ever go wrong if she 's been brought up to understand the moral standards of Colorado , and I hope I 'm still the mountainsidedaisy and not the rank orchid !

There is , Hayden found , something like a system of credits for sight/seeing : doing a cathedral thoroughly counts , let us say , eleven points  --  exterior only , five ; looking for not less than one second at every single picture in a large gallery comes to thirteen , inspectinga mountain village rarely beheld by tourists is seventeen , dining at a celebrated restaurant is six , but if you found it all by yourself , the credit is nine . By this most reasonable standard for computing good works , the Windelbanks had acquired at least four times as many points of merit as Hayden . They were pained by his evident sloth , and fretted out a numberof queries . Had he seen Madame Tussaud 's Waxworks in London ? In Paris , had he done Napoleon 's Tomb and had fish at Prunier 's ? At his No 's the doctor mourned , " Well , I must say ! What have you done with your time over here ? How a man could have this wonderful chance and come all the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hayden childishly reached for equality , tried to show off , tried to show what an utterly changed and Europeanized and generallyimproved edition he had become . He spoke in Italian to the waiter ( who seemed to understand parts of what he said ) but it was no go . The Windelbanks had definitely taken the lead in culture now , and they brought out a few scientific conclusionswith an air of authority . The citizens of Bologna ( where they had spent three hours ) were definitely more cheerful than the citizens of Padua ( two hours ) . Throughout France , the sale of American soft drinks ( thanks to the purity of our soldiers who had served in that untutoredland ) was practically wiping out the sale of wine . In Cannes ( twenty-two hours ) there is always rain , at all seasons of the year , and the Windelbanks had warned the hotel clerk therep104that he was a very silly fellow to remain . He ought to see the climate in Newlife , Colorado . But they so far forgave Hayden as to promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human catandogs whom they had picked up along their way and who might be arriving here soon : to that delightful young American couple they met in Glasgow  --  the husband owned a brickyard , so Hayden and he would have a lot of professional interests in common , and his little wife was such a dear little woman ; she liked to read the guidebook aloud , and Hayden would enjoy them both so much , and enjoy showing them around Florence . And the splendid Holland Dutchman who was so amusing about salmon-fishing in Scotland , and the wonderful Baptist pulpit-orator from Chicago , who would enjoy showing Hayden around Florence and explaining the Catholic Church to him . Hayden had not meant to call for help , but later in the evening he petitioned Olivia to help him have lunch with the Windelbanksnext day . Once , he knew , she would have refused , but ever since he had met her , silken and defenseless , in the hall , she had shown him a shade of pleading humility that almost slipped into obedience . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people he seemed to know at home . He put in the morning before lunch in helping the Windelbanksexchange their dollars and in leading them through pages 400-426 of the tenth edition of Baedeker 's Northern Italy , along with the compulsory daily shopping : the kodak films , the lace collars and sweater for Jean Jr. , their married daughter . It would not be accurate to say that they had bought a sweater for Jean Jr . in every country in Europe . They had never been in Albania.  |p105Hayden  also advised them in the daily choice of three plain and four colored post cards to send home . " How many folks do you send souvenir cards to regularly , Hay ? " nosed the doctor . " Why , not any  --  regularly , " admitted Hayden , and then , guiltily , " or irregularly either ! " " You do n't ? Why , you 're missing half the fun of travel , to say nothing of the pleasure you might be bringing into people 's drab lives ! " From a waistcoat pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got the names and addresses here of my forty-seven very closest friends , relatives and patients that are prompt pay , and every single week I send each of ' em a card from somewhere in Europe , always with some cheering message or interesting piece of information  --  say , like total population of Italy . And this treasure-house book , as I call it , also contains my birthday list for use at home , with folks ' names under the dates of their birthdays and wedding anniversaries . How many cards do you send out on birthdays and Easter and Christmas ? " " Maybe not as many as I ought to , " said the abashed liar , who darkly detested all standard greeting cards depicting two sparrowsand an antelope , with the apostrophe , " Where'er you are or go or do , this festal day we think of you !

Do n't forget that , among all these snooty foreigners that they simply do n't or wo n't understand what a real friend is like ! And , mind you , I do n't just mean the good old gang that you see every week at the Kiwanis or at church or the countryclubbar , and that pay their dentist right on the dot , but the dear and tender chums of the magic bygone days , long severed but forgotten ne'er , that if they happen to be in your town for a conventionor on a motor tour will honor you by phoning you first thing and coming right out to the house to take potluck with you and cheer up the wife by kidding her along .

Hm . Home ! You know ... " Bill Windelbank was dreaming . When he spoke , all the brag and bumptiousness were for a moment gone from him , and he looked at Hayden appealingly : " You know , Jean and me are awful seasoned tourists and we always make out like we never get homesick , not even for Jean Junior or her two babies or for the cottonwoods along the crick just below our house . But one time , this trip , we were in a Paris joint , real gay but high-toned , and suddenly , with no warning , the band strikes up Home on the Range  --  ' where never is heard a discouraging word . ' Well , sir , I looked at Jean and Jean looked at me , and suddenly I could just see those cottonwoods , and God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I could have cried ! And Jean  --  she did ! " How good they were , thought Hayden , and how kind  --  asp107the Dodsworths were kind , as Sir Henry Belfont was not , as Olivia was not . Olivia met them at the Baglioni roof garden for lunch , and horror struck immediately . Hayden could not stop Dr. Windelbank who , to Olivia 's small leering delight , referred to him as Haysy-Daisy , and who chronicled the one episode of which Hayden was most ashamed , for its cheap bullying and hysterical loss of temper : the time when he had threatened a tough sub-contractor with an empty revolver and the man had caved in , all two hundred and forty hairy pounds of him . " Hay was a major in the last war , and a champ pistol shot ! " crowed Dr. Windelbank . " And Hay was also nothing but a boss draftsman in that crusadeand never heard a shot fired in anger ! " glared Hayden . But it seemed to him that Olivia looked at him almost affectionately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I like you much better as a competent rowdy than as a polite dilettante . But how those people hated me ! They are very brave and charitable , but they feel entirely competent to tell me what to teach  --  to tell Italy and France what to teach  --  to tell the bishop how to pray and God how to listen to the teaching and the prayer . "  |p108ON  THE northern rim of Florence , toward the mutely watching mountains , Fiesole perches on its hilltop like a monstrouseagle , with its bell-tower for upstretched neck . It looks down on the flood plain of the Arno , which is Florence , and remembersthat it was a ponderous-walled Etruscan city twentyfivehundred years ago , when Florence was a nameless huddle of mud huts . Up here , Boccaccio 's maidens stayed the plague with song and most improper story . Half a mile from the Fiesole piazza , on the northern edge of the cliff , is the small Raspanti Inn . The window-side tables look into the sweetly climbing Mugnone Valley , where the river runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red-tiled and yellow-walled , with airy loggias for the summer . Hayden had bought a tiny Italian car  --  a topolino , people called it : a " little mouse . " To get into it you had to hoist your knees up to the level of your forehead , but it had a gallant motor for hill-climbing , and it hugged the corkscrew curves of the Italian mountains , or went happily cantering past the enormousblue omnibuses . In it he had flashed to Arezzo , and to thep109old walled town of Lucca , now that , in mid-February , spring was imminent , the grass between the olive trees was tinselgreenand mimosa was displaying its canary-colored showers . Olivia had gone with him once or twice , her obedience still astonishinghim , and today , at the Raspanti , she was seemingly contented to be with him . " One of those old farmhouses down there , " he said , as they finished their fedora cake and ordered coffee and Strega , " a man , a family , could live quietly there . " " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there 's a good bus , so you could go to the Laurentian Library and the Uffizi , " granted Olivia . " A lazy spring day like this , I ca n't imagine going on anywhere else , not even to Egypt . " " But I 'm not lazy . Industry is my one poor virtue . " " Olivia ! Let 's talk  --  really talk ! " " Must we ? " " Yes . We are two lone ships in a waste of the South Pacific , the days so empty and the nights so long under the stars . Why ca n't we sail together ? " " Maybe the ships are going in opposite directions . " " Ca n't they stop a moment and get closer together ? " " Your poetic inquiry sounds very much like what my vulgar students at Winnemac would call propositioning me : " " Olivia , you say things that shock me !

I look at your mail on the hall table  --  shamelessly . If you have some magnet , he 's probably imaginary . Like my own obsession with . . . Olivia , I never have talked to you about my wife ; have n't talked to anybody much , I guess . I just told you she was killed in a motor accident . The way she died is important , because sometimes I feel I murdered her by my careless driving , and start brooding . Now , I make myself come out of it , and realize I 've just been wallowing in a melodrama of regret , like a child scaring itself by drawing spiders . I 'm trying , at least , to look at her death the way a good doctor would . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if she was n't kind-hearted like those people you met  --  the Windelbanks . ( Caprice always thought they were a pair of stuffed shirts , by the way , with minds that were n't so much photographic as phonographic . ) She was a bluebird . But she only liked the accidental things about me : my tennis and swimming , and I used to be not so bad a dancer till I got tired of the highballs and the shrieking and the swapping of wives . But she never liked any of my virtues . " " Have you many ? " " Yes . I have . As you know . I 'm dependable and punctual and a fine designer of unfine houses . Those tedious virtues . But I also have a fighting conviction that men can be more than troutfishermen ; that there must have been human beings who could build San Miniato . I have much more imagination about possible ways of living than you have , of course . " " Oh ! Have you ! "  | " Much . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a job , but I take a chance on making myself ridiculous by feeling them as life , visibly around us still . You  --  this continualaversion of yours to the normal male . . . " " Oh , quit it ! Do n't try to show off your knowledge of psychoanalysisas well as of Lucrezia Borgia ! " " Olivia , you 've never let yourself live . Lucrezia  --  they did n't hate her because she did any poisoning , but because she could handle so many lovers . Why do n't you imitate her , not just dig her poor lovely bones out of their paper grave ? You could be adorable , but you 're nothing but an expert in pedagogy researchingin the quickest methods of teaching knitting . " " Oh , pooh ! " " There 's an American girl wandering around Europe somewhere , Roxanna , a redhead , that I despair of because she 's gone native with a gang of artistic heels .

So naive in believing that every woman ought to be a college-campus petted " She added , with spite and somethingnot unlike jealousy , " As your redheaded Miss Roxanna apparently is ! " " She is no friend of petting . She does n't need to be ! Yes , I am Western . I wo n't eat my breakfast unless I can lasso it . And yet in my attitude toward self-repressing women , I am exactly likep112Nat Friar or Ugo Tramontana . We consider them monstrosities . " " You do n't know what you 're talking about .

She 's so armored that a bowman has to try a shot at her . Let 's see if she 's human . " He slipped his arm round her , his hand over her shoulder , a sweet slim curve that contented his palm . She seemed not rigid and prudish but still with terror . She whimpered , like a bewildered girl shocked by a trusted old friend , " Oh , do n't  --  oh , do n't  --  oh , please ! " He had quick pity for her . He released her , and she dropped into her chair at the table again , her face all one raddled blur of emotion , and as he sat down , she spoke tremblingly : " Yes , there is . . . . It is true . I 'm not quite natural toward any man younger than Professor Friar . But there is a reason . It 's not me . I was turned so . " I was twenty  --  so young and undeveloped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigy ; I got my bachelor 's degree at eighteen and my master 's at nineteen . At a big state university , this was . I was working for my doctor 's degree and teaching a couple of classes and reading Professor Vintner 's themes for him . I thought I knew all about vices and seductions and the elegant wiles of gallantsin the Middle Ages , but I had never taken time to study them first-hand , on the U campus in this Middling Age . Though plenty of invitations ! I knew all about Cellini but nothing about the local quarterback . " Leslie Vintner , dear Professor Vintner , my faculty preceptor.  |p113Euro|pean  History from 450 to 1750 . Tall and gray-eyed and a little rustic in his looks , but Heavens , so slick and cosmopolitan in his talk ! He was very , very learned and clever ; he had studied at Montpellier and Rome and Berne and the Sorbonne ; he used to read Provencal poetry aloud , delightful lyrics about roses and Maytime meadows and sighing lovers . But he knew about all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : vintages and baronesses and baccarat and Josephine Baker singing ... . Of course he had a cautious wife , with a small income of her own . Dreary and getting plump . " He encouraged me  --  so fatuously , I see now . We used to sit side by side on the greasy leatherette couch in his office , under the reproduction of Fra Angelico saints , and smoke cigarettes and drink tea with gin in it , and he 'd tell me I was going to be another Madame de Sevigne . I was going to be poet , scholar , court beauty , and Gabriele D'Annunzio would come back from his private perfumed hell to worship me . " Leslie and I were most superior to that hustling campus . We were pagans , we were winged spirits from the High Renaissance , only ( and honestly , he could do the most convincing repressed sob ) just now his wings were being clipped by his nasty big-foot wife , and only in my sweet , languorous presence could he put on his rainbow-colored plumes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy , eager kid , so devoted , so proud , but it was n't just lambkin love . I would have done murder for him , or sung over washing his undershirts . I wrote sonnets about him that I was too humble to show him , and I went out of my way to walk past his house ( that nasty gingerbread cake ! ) late at night , and if there was a party andp114they were laughing , I was so jealous that my stomach quivered . I used to keep a silk-tipped French cigarette butt of his in my purse , and take it out and kiss it . " So of course I fell for him completely whenever it amused him to finish up the torture . Honestly , he should n't have killed anything as young and loyal as I was ! " Then he got impatient . I forgot everything I had learned from history  --  I thought he really meant his promises ! I thought we would be found out and both of us fired from the university , of course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and do the cooking and keep chickens and love it , and then some day he would be divorced and , marry me and Yale or California would understand what valorous medieval souls we were and give him a call , and we 'd live in a tower of glory and . . . You know . " What 's worse , I suppose I girlishly trilled all this to him , and too often . He must have become pretty bored and impatient , because I certainly was n't so anesthetic and sneering then that I chilled demanding gentlemen like Mr. Hayden Chart  --  or Prince Ugo ! I was recklessly passionate  --  panting . Poor Leslie ! He did a magnificent job of kicking me out . He really made it all quite clear  --  though he must have been irritated by the way I sobbed . " He told me that he had never thought of me as anything but a sentimental fool , very bad at exact dates , very confused in my literary style , and a perfect pest about telephoning him at home . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the passionin me , he said , made it seem cheap . " Even before I had quit sobbing , while I was still wiping my nose with my coarse little cotton handkerchief  --  it was all I could afford but I did like it ; it had such a nice rose stamped inp115one corner  --  before I had finished crying I had determined that I would never again betray passion  --  or feel any . I never have . I 've ruled my feelings like mutinous soldiers . And so  --  and now  --  that frigidity has become natural . For all my life ! " She rose slowly , and he with her . He kissed her cheek , very lightly , and sighed , " Poor darling . Dreadful ! " Not till they were packed together in the topolino did he go on : " It would not be too ridiculous to think of us as married . We 're both lost orphans . We might seek the City of Peace together . " For a second he took his right hand from the steering wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure . But she answeredresolutely : " Hayden , I would n't trust myself to marry anybody . I think I 've controlled my natural storminess , but as a wife I would be too attentive and absorbing . And I 'm ambitious ; I want high academic rank , but that I could moderate . The trouble is that if I gave it up for marriage , I 'd be ambitious then for my poor , driven husband . I 'd push him into absurdly big undertakings  --  influential people and get in on all the gaudiest shows . I 've becomea cool scholar , not bad , and that 's how I want to stay . Though if I did go native and fall for anybody  --  it conceivably could be you , Mr. Chart ! " " Good ! " " You 're gentle , but you are n't obsequious . And you 're so young and credulous .

That makes being your wife sound attractive . But I 'm a dynamo ; I 'm not safe . Guard yourself ! " When they parted , in the hall of the Tre Corone , he kissed her cheek again . She clutched his arm , turning her face of an ivory saint toward him with a sharp breath , and then she fled.  |p117SP  RING came in with the almonds and cherries and plum trees blossoming in early March , and Olivia and Hayden wanderedthrough Florence . The American Colony delightedly recognizedthem as potential recruits to matrimony and to the Colony . From Sir Henry Belfont , whom he had vaguely met at teas , Hayden had a stiff note informing him , somewhat in the manner of a court summons , that Sir Henry had a nephew with Shell Oil who , years ago , had met Hayden in London . The baronet was pleased to command Hayden to luncheon , and would he care to bring some young lady of his acquaintance ? He took Olivia . In the topolino . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir Henry marched them through his house . Leniently , not expecting them to appreciate such treasures , he showed off his paintings . His Villa Satiro had started out , as a fortified manor house , in 1301 . It had three-hundred-year-old dwarf lemon trees , and Dante slept here . The handsomest room in the villa  --  it had been the bed cham/ber of a grand duchess  --  was Sir Henry 's study . The walls were bookcases of English oak , with a royal ransom in folios and illuminatedchoir books . The ceiling was a fantasy of little nymphs beckoning to satyrs of no strong moral character , and under this mocking rout , at an oak desk which had belonged to William of Orange , Sir Henry wrote his letters . But his desk chair had nothing of the royal touch about it . It was of the latest ingenuity , with a sponge-rubber cushion , for while Sir Henry 's rear elevation was imposing , it was not suited to oaken hardness . Too many tons of cream sauces had gone to the construction of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was surrounded by women who admired him , or at least listened to him , he would stand with his great head slightly on one side , with a fixed and somewhat silly smile , as though he were shy of his own bulky splendor . In his black jacket and linen collar  --  " no gentleman makes a racetrack spectacle of himself in soft colored shirts "  --  Sir Henry 's resemblance to the Rock of Gibraltar would have been remarkable , if it had not been for his untrimmed eyebrows . These eyebrows drooped in monumental triangles , like the manes of little lions . He had a mustache and a precise small beard as well , but they seemed to be only drippings from the eyebrows . Sometimes , rather wistfully , he experimented with a monocle , but it was lost under an eyebrow and left him looking as nearly foolish as a man so much in love with his own nobility , so admittedly representative of all that was best in the English county families , could ever look . But his wife was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luncheon were the Belfonts , Hayden and Olivia , Princep119ited the host by snatching the conversation away from him . She was a thin scabbard in her fawn suit and tight white turban . She was American-born , swift , flashing , detestable . Rustically watching her , Hayden comprehended the ageless elegance which Roxanna Eldritch envied , but poor Roxy was an acolyte beside the Mar- ' chesa , who suavely jeered not only at America but at Parisian drunkards , English watering-places , old Roman society , and the Sadie Lurcher Riviera set , of which Valdarno was herself a member . Hayden sought the eye of Olivia , shadowed by the snowy peak of Mt . Sir Henry , and they mutely confided that they did n't like this . They said practically nothing at lunch . Prince Ugo  --  fine , lean , courteous  --  said only that Dr. Lomond was much honored at the Laurentian Library . Olivia glowed , and Sir Henry looked at her for the first time . The Marchesa Valdarno also looked at her  --  with contempt . Throughout luncheon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking in four languages at once , switchingfrom English to Italian in the one same sentence , with the next in French . He longed for the roar and whattameaning of Jesse Bradbin . But the soup was good . But after lunch , as they rode home in the humble topolino , Olivia yelled with unacademic vigor that she hated Sir Henry and his mob and wanted never to meet any of them again . " I would like to see him again , though , " said Hayden , " because I 'd like to get to the bottom of why so many Americans and well-heeled Britishers live permanently in Italy . Most of the Italians do n't much like us . They consider our drinkers too wetp120and our hermits too chilly and our outmarrying girls , like that Valdarno woman , disloyal to their husbands  --  some of them , I mean . Yet we cling to this country . Why ? I 'll go to the Villa Satiro again , if I get invited , which is not too likely . I do n't think Belfont considers me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither . And no more villa . It 's too Satiro ! " At night he was conscious of Olivia , down the hall , and wondered whether he would again meet her in feminine mufti , free of her hard uniform of professorial brown serge . But their next jaunt was considerably less abandoned . In the fashion of Newlifein his father 's era , he took her to church ; not to a resounding Roman basilica but to a home-town church , a Main-Street church , in English Gothic but flavored , too , with prairie wild roses . The St. James American Episcopal Church in Florence has no more Episcopalians than Methodists or Unitarians or plain indifferentists . In the bright stone chancel , the American flag hangs along with the Italian , and for an hour every Sunday morning even the Colonists who seem almost alienated from Home are betrayed into being American again . Social climbing is halted , and girl students kneel beside florid gentlemen who have superbly been in steel . Most of the Colonists are given to complaining at dinner parties that America has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impertinent children , tasteless food and fiendish labor leaders who will soon be purging all responsible citizens . Yet at St. James 's , as they unite in the old hymns , there rises in them something primitive . Colonists who have been asserting that they would as soon diep121as go back to the States and see executives being obsequious to bellboys and subway conductors and their own cooks , now hear through the music at St. James 's the heavy shoes on PlymouthRock , the barefoot Confederates marching in the wintry Tennessee mountains , the plodding of moccasins on the Oregon Trail . In their flippant unfaith to their lean and bitter mother , America , there is yet more faith than in their zest for Europe , their opulent mistress . Hayden came in Sabbatically double-breasted blue , with a black Homburg hat , and he was proud of Olivia 's blue silk and her resolutely white gloves and the unexpected prayer-book of celluloidcover painted with forget-me-nots which she must have borrowed at the pensione . Through service , he was content to see how properly she rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was faintly lonely for home . He knew then that he was unalterably an American ; he knew what a special and mystical experience it is , for the American never really emigrates but only travels ; perhaps travels for two or three generations but at the end is still marked with the gaunt image of Tecumseh . After church , they had lunch amid the fine linen of the Hotel Excelsior , and Hayden boasted : " You did well in church today  --  for a heathen . I am a correct Episcopalian , and my firm built Holy Cross Pro-cathedral . " " Not me ! I was brought up a Primitive Baptist . It 's the oldtimereligion ! ' How American I still am , even when I pretend to have covered it over with Venetian velvet ! " " It 's a perfect spring day . Let 's wander all afternoon . " " Not me . I have a lot to read , " said the sturdy girl from ProfessorVintner 's class . So they wandered all afternoon , through the spring-em/blazoned city , through dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by plaid work-shirts hung up to dry before a fifth-story window , past the Cerchi tower , among the Sunday crowd oozing along the Arno , with a Punch and Judy show in the Piazza Ognissanti . For tea they went not to a bar favored by the Colony but were so bold as to sit out in the Square of the Republic , in front of Gilli 's . They climbed up the winding driveway of the Viale dei Colli and felt not the grandeur of Florence but its simple pleasantness , under the trees , like the pleasantness of Newlife in June . For dinner , Olivia guided him to a little basement trattoria . They went down slippery marble stairs into a cellar with small tables of transparent oilcloth over green-and-white table-covers . On the rough walls were very bad landscapes with which art students had paid their board-bills : landscapes with cow and river and a mountain composed of cake icing . The one waiter was guiltless of a white jacket ; he wore a sweater and screamed amiably at the patrons and sometimes sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks and shopkeepers and soldiers whirled their strings of spaghetti and acrobatically ate fried potatoes with their knives . Olivia was an intimate of the place . The waiter beamed and led them through a more solemn dining room where , with white tablecloths , dined the few tourists , on to the delights of the kitchen , and that was a kitchen out of a Christmas story . The floor was of red tiles and the charcoal broiler lighted up a string of copper stewpans . It glared on the swarthy face of the fat woman cook so that she looked like a lady fiend . But beside the broiler was a modern electric range , crimson enamel and coolp123steel . On a table , ready to be cooked , were all the varieties of pasta : fat tagliatelli noodles , thin and writhing taglierini , tortellinilike snug little white doughnuts , and the sage green of lasagneverdi , made with spinach . On benches at the long central table five hardy taxi-drivers were dredging their grassy soup , and they looked up to salute Olivia with " Ecco ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed to eat in the kitchen , " Olivia explained , as they took places on a bench . " I ate in the outside room for a long while before the Signora would let me join them here . Now I 'm part of the family , and you will be . " " I appreciate it . " And indeed when the drivers nodded to him as though he were not a Foreigner and a Fare but a man , he felt more honored than in any toleration by Sir Henry Belfont . Olivia was hearty with a plate of giant ribbed maccheroni with meaty Bolognese sauce , and they drank red table wine poured out of what looked like a Newlife pop bottle . Roaring with friendliness , the drivers wanted to know how stood the Dottoressa , and had she dug out of the library any scandals more recent than i600 ? She fenced with them in colloquialItalian , and they cackled . Though the sharp career woman is new in Italy , there has always been a tradition of the Learned Lady , like Camilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Olivia seemed to wear the laurel crown with ease . Hayden studied her with fond pride . Was he movingly in love with her , a thing to last ? With a throb , with sorrow for the shallowness of his tribute to Caprice , he wondered if his heart had forgotten her complete , and her faded little ghost was wanderingnow forlorn in the Colorado winter , shelterless.  |p124The  restaurant was conducted by a family of whom the grandmother was chieftain and chef , the youngish father was the outsidewaiter in the sweater , his wife was assistant chef , their two small sons were dishwashers and bus boys , and the baby , with its dark eyes and humorous mouth , was the most expansive customer . All evening , it seemed to Hayden , that baby was eating , eating everything , ham and breast of chicken and peas cooked with bacon and rather more red wine than strictly modern mothersgive to the hygienic infants of America . The baby and Olivia found each other delightful and slightly funny . They winked at each other , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . She flushed then ; her lips were tight and she breathed quickly . Hayden could not tell whether this contact with the flesh of a baby was gratifying or distressing . She fell altogether silent and stared at the baby with a sun-and-shadow alternation of frown and tenderness . He guessed that she was thinking of Professor Leslie Vintner . When the drivers had gone and the kitchen was somewhat more quiet , Olivia said carelessly , " I 'll have to be leaving Florencethis coming week . " " What ? " " Oh , only for three-four days , and not till Tuesday . I have to go to Venice , which it happens I have never seen , to look up some records in the State Archives . " " I 've never been in Venice , either . I 'll drive you up there . " " Oh , I do n't think we could do that . No , I 'm quite sure we could n't . Thank you , though . " " Who 's going to mind ? It would be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I would be ! "  | " What ? " " I mean . . . We 've had a lovely day , and I 've enjoyed it , and all the more reason why I must remember my resolution not to be dominated by any male . " " Who 's trying to dominate you ? Just friends . " " Not even too lively a friendship with a man , if it could possiblygrow into too much importance . I 've been slack in regard to you . Spring ! I must put on my armor again . There ! I have ! You 're just an amiable gentleman who lives in my pensione . " He was irritated to ruthlessness by her undependability . She was being a tease , flirtatious and bogus , encouraging him and then drawing back . He expected that of a campus hoyden , not of a devoted scholar . She could , it seemed , be just as phony as Caprice  --  inthe opposite direction : the Caprice who pretended , like a man , to be only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of nothing else . " So , " he said treacherously , " we 're just amiable acquaintances again ; very polite . " " That seems to be it . " " With no silly sentiment between us . " " None whatever . " " Two careless laddy-boys together . So we can go to Venice , without any compromise ! " " Oh , stop it ! " " I wo n't argue , but that 's the logic of it . " He thought she looked disappointed when he talked vigorously , and only , of the Dodsworths ' new car . They returned to the Tre Corone rather silently and , for once , he accompanied her down the hall to her room and , as she opened the door , for the first time he saw the interior.  |p126It  was decidedly not dusty and doctoral . Her bed was covered with a fluffy white spread and over it was a cast of smiling little angels . He seized her hand , and urged , " Olivia ! Let 's both go to Venice ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have too many live joys . Let 's discover the wonder of Venice together ! " " But if we should go  --  oh then , please ! "  |p127OL  I V I A was youthful in white linen . " For a scholar , she spends quite a lot on clothes , " he reflected . Like a girl back home , she was not wearing stockings , and there was a glow of bare ivory knees as she tucked herself into the topolino . " Is it possible that she has chucked her aloofness , that she likes me a good deal ? " he wondered . They were close together in the tiny car on this , their first mammothexcursion . Wisteria was beginning to paint the walls , the mimosa bush was in yellow cataracts , and the daffodils were like shy English visitors . The Tuscan spring was sweet with the smell of plowed fields among the vine rows , where gentle oxen moved in leisure , great white oxen against the brown earth , and the liberated lovers were bound for Venice , city to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawled , spiraled , sped up on the road across the Apennines that is the highway to Bologna and Venice . After the Futa Pass , before the high notch of Raticosa , there was a long upland ridge with valleys like unknown kingdoms castle-starred below them . It was flying . The sheep pastures , thep128pocket vineyards , the dumpy plaster farmhouses , and lone monasterieswhich were high above the valley floor and yet hundreds of feet below the car could be comfortably reached , said Hayden , by a jump and then a good deal of quiet falling . It was a twisted trail for eagles . Olivia looked out of the car and directly down . " I 'm not much used to mountain driving . Are you good at it ? " " Used to it , at least . " " You sound confident . Then I am . " Before Raticosa they were in a mountain-top barren of stunted pine and heather . Up here , it was still late winter , and patches of sandy snow were dark along the road as they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks beyond them were solid snow . " This must be frightening , in January . Like your Rockies . I 'm a plodding plainsman and marsh-jumper . A lot of my childhood in Southern New Jersey , " said Olivia . The Italians have been admirable road-engineers since centuriesbefore Julius Caesar , and the car came down fast but securely on the corkscrew road that drops from the pass to Bologna in its valley , brisk red Bologna with its arcades . Then it was all flat land across Emilia and the Veneto , and eight hours from Florence , they left the car at the Piazzale Roma and magically took a gondola up the canals of Venice , past palaces whose doorstepswere washed by the sea channels . Venice , on the map , resembles one large island ( which is really a group of small ones ) curved like a heavy thumb and hand , grasping at the head of another island like a timid animal with agitated pointed paws . When Hayden pointed this out ,  |p129rattling  a map in the breeze , Olivia cried , " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " For propriety , they stayed at two different pensioni near the Piazza Morosini . They had cocktails at the Palazzo Gritti , the most luxurious hotel in Italy , and dined at the Colombo on tiny shrimps fresh from the Adriatic , listening to the Venetian citizensstanding at the wine counter and peacefully quarreling . Then they walked through Venice till midnight , getting lost and found and more lost than ever among streets that changed their names every two blocks and after eight or ten , ended slap in a courtyard with an ancient wellhead and no exit or else crept up on a bridge over a canal and down under the bulk of a palace , in darkness , to emerge on an astonishing square , vast , empty , palace-walled . They saw arches reflected in the small interior canals and the more exuberant illumination mirrored flickeringlyin the wide Grand Canal , caught through alleys that were only three-foot slits between six-story warrens . Here is the only city without wheeled traffic , the only city dedicated to human beings and not to dictatorial automobiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stilled reverence through the small crowds , free of the horrors of motorcycles and of the bicycles that elsewhere in Italy stalk pedestrians and bring them down . Venice is not a city . It is one colossal palace on a low rock in the sea . These are not squares and courtyards but roofless halls , and if the stone is worn and the plaster blotched , there is gaudy Renaissance history in balconies and Gothic windows . These are not streets but corridors of the palace , and these bright bazaars , heaped with figured satin and ivory triptychs andp130spun iridescent glass , are not shops but the ancient loot of the doges , and this is not stone pavement but the palace floor , polishedby centuries of feet that first skipped here , then strode , then shuffled till they were borne to the funeral gondola by sturdier feet ; a floor so polished thus that by night light all the granite roughnesses vanish in an even glow . All round the palace a breeze flickers in from Ragusa and Albania and the Adriatic isles . Fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and disdainful steamers fresh from Egypt and its musky airs , and the gondolas , with their small prow lights , lurch over the Grand Canal , the gondoliers swinging on the poop . Here and not elsewhere live Neptune and his daughters , whose hair is spray . They were visible that night to Hayden and his girl , pacing through hollow-sounding piazzas , their arms round each other . He had little to say but " To find all this with you ! " and reluctantly he kissed her good night at her door . By working late , Olivia finished her research the next day , and they dined in grandeur at the Gritti and again walked the night half out . All the morning after they spent in the Piazza San Marco . They sat , in an idleness and contentment so profound that they amounted to activity , at a table outside the Lavena , and watched the operetta of the crowd : the tourists feeding the pigeonswhich , at the bang of the clock struck by the bronze giants , rose together in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards and coral necklaces and the guide with the red scarf who was always saying hopefully , " Guide ? Me spik gud English . " An American destroyer was in harbor , and the crew and officers had flooded ashore , each with a camera , from executive officer top131mess boy . San Marco cathedral must that day have exceeded its quota of being photographed fifty times an hour . Of these rangy American boys , with the freshness of Salem Harbor or the Iowa hills under their salt glaze , Hayden was proud . " Look at them ! And next week , in Greece or Smyrna or Spain ! They 've brought back the tradition of the clipper days when Yankee faces ( including a **27;5654;TOOLONG of mine ) were seen in every port of China and Africa and the Spice Islands ! " He was incredibly contented with the friendly presence of Olivia , the magnificence of the hour and place , where he could see Byzantine and Gothic and Renaissance all together , in a tremendousharmony . He thought that Olivia looked almost like a fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover 's gift , all the architectural lore he was harvesting . He dutifully inquired , " But do you think we 'd better be starting ? It 's going to cloud over . " " Not yet . I 've forgotten the responsible Dr. Lomond . Let 's drown in this sun while it lasts . Americans are always so restless to be off ; they follow some mental timetable that they 'll probably take with them to Heaven , to the considerable annoyance of the timeless angels , who do n't mind a bit if you 're a couple of thousand years late for choir practice ! " Her complaint was generously illustrated by an American tourist couple at a table near . They were people of sixty , and prosperous ; they looked as though they had retired from the woes of golf and children and could be at leisure now . But while the wife bent her neck forward , enraptured by the glow of the San Marco mosaics , the husband showed his frustration by jiggling his feet , tapping onp132the table , violently trying to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yawning , and making a sporadic sound halfwaybetween a hum and a band-saw . He blurted at last , " Well , come on , come on , Heaven 's sake , let 's get going ! " " Going where ? " his wife sighed . " We 're here ! " " I know , but good God , you ca n't just sit around all day ! Let 's  --  we can go back to the hotel and write some more letters , ca n't we ? " When the man of affairs and efficiency and death was gone , Hayden sighed , " I 've said that a lot of the Colonists in Florence are too idle , but that 's incomparably better than the restless-footed sightseers like that man . Yes , you and I 'll sit here for seven years . " But the clouds were coming now , were darkening , and he was dependable enough to make Olivia go . When they had reached their topolino and started southward , rain was already scouting in a sulky afternoon sky . Olivia looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was somewhatmussy ; she was half yawning . He ordered , " Go to sleep . The late hours these two evenings have been too much for you . I 'll drive fast , but with the care due to my learned passenger . " She dozed off , with that ivory cheek , that sleek blackness of hair , near his shoulder . He wanted to touch her , but in his rigid creed nothing was more enduring than his father 's croaking injunction , " Both hands on the wheel , Son , especially when you 're out with the girls . " And he had a memory of a car whirling off the Bison Park highway , turning over . He remembered , too , that once before , when they had been coming down from Fiesole , he had for a second touched her hand in the car . Out of all thisp33he had now a quite satisfactory nervousness and worry till he made himself forget it . It was raining before they reached Bologna , and from her quivering he knew that Olivia had awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pavement not very slippery . Relax , darling , " he clucked , and he was surprised at the kindness in his own voice . He made a business of getting them home . They did not talk , and she must again have slid into sleep . As they swung up the steep climb beyond Bologna , up into the mountains , snowflakes began shivering down in front of them ; tentative wisps of down , then large , solid-looking flakes against which , he began to imagine , they might bump and be smashed . Olivia awoke with a nervous " Oh ! " " I 'm used to winter driving . And good road . Do n't worry . " But it was hard to see clearly through the windshield . The blades of the wiper could not do much against the thick grease of wet snow ; the glass was streaky and clouded , and on the sharp mounting curves he had to slacken speed , waste the momentum he needed , to see which way the curves were turning . As she leaned to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that she was rigid . At just over two thousand feet of altitude , they came instantly , without warning , into a belt of fog . He was blind in the fog , and he had to keep going or slide back . It was impossible to see the sides of the road . He opened the window beside him and drove with his head thrust outside , the snow licking his forehead and cheeks and chilled nose , the fog soaking his hair . But movingp34slowly , sometimes at five miles an hour , he could make out thus the boulder-marked boundaries of the highway . For all the fog , the wind was loud enough so that not till she had repeated it did he hear Olivia 's distressed , " What would happen if we shot off the road here ? " He drew his head far enough into the car to answer , " Probably would n't hurt a thing . We 'd just drop onto a meadow slope and be stopped by the rocks and brush . " So ? To run off the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had crushed Caprice ? Was that his ever-revolving fate ? She went on , " And then again we might keep on going  --  five hundred feet ? " " Could be . " She laughed . " Oh , its all right . I 'm getting used to it . You are n't scared ? " " This is just routine fog driving . Bus drivers do this regularly , and never even notice it . " " But you 're not a routine bus driver . You have no idea how I admire your competence . But think of all the fine scenery that must be lavishing itself unnoticed , straight down below us there  --  on both sides of this ridge . I 'm glad I ca n't see how far down ! " He was too absorbed to comment . He had never driven in a worse fog , and with a road so steep , so curving , so slippery with snow , he could not save their lives if the car skidded and took charge . He was back below the Bison Park highway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he would not let himself be there . He bleakly forced himself to be only here , single-minded . He methodically considered stopping in one of the turnouts ,  |p35but  with boundary lines so blurred by the fog , he might be hit there by another car . It was safer to go on . He was startled when two sickly car lights were conjured up just in front of him , and he had to swerve , to take the chance of going off the road and down , bottomlessly down . She shuddered , " Oh ! Should n't we stop ? " " We shall , the minute we hit a place , a village or something where there is room for safe parking , and we can get out and have a drink . I remember one or two inns up along here . And we 've got to begin thinking about holing up for the night . This fog may keep up till morning , and if we stayed in the car , we 'd about freeze . But we may find a country inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there tonight ? " " Probably . " " All right . " He was pleased that she should agree , and a little dubious about his own pleasure in it . They had now a month , a year , of agony . Snow slid maliciouslythrough the open window beside Hayden , and he could feel Olivia 's shoulder shaking convulsively as she became more wet and chilled . The stone markers were only darker blurs in a general dark drifting gray . But they had to go on . They were penned in a moving prison for a lifetime sentence , to be ended , perhaps , by sudden and shocking death . But they had to go on . Only with a tired incredulity did he see and lose and see again a fabulous glow in the smear ahead , and then a cluster of fogwrappedlights . " Golly ! " he said , and not very logically wanted to kiss Olivia but , busy with the clammy wheel , did nothing so reasonable.  |p136They  had reached some kind of a fair-sized building , with a blessed wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car till I size the place up . " Both of them breathed long and sighingly with the relief of being , for a moment , safe . Their refuge , he found , was a mountain-country combination of hotel , grocery shop , wine shop , bar , billiard room and restaurant . At the counter a dozen young mountaineers were drinking , tough but not unfriendly , and they nodded to his greeting . The landlady , in her cascade of striped apron , was a woman of character and considerable poundage . The walls were roughcast , and the three dining tables had cloths worn and darned , but it was all clean enough , and there was a pink terra-cotta stove that shouted warmth . Yes , the landlady said , she had three bedrooms for rent , two still unoccupied ; yes , he could have a fine supper here , with the choicest of veal . It was toward seven now , with no chance of the fog clearing . He hurried out to assure Olivia , " Warm ! Clean ! Two rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " She crawled out of the topolino , a comic figure in the laprobe heaped over her white linen . She tottered with stiffness  --  wavering , sobbing . He held her to him , not kissing her but laying his warmed cheek against her ghostly cheek , and she clung to him , hands tight about his shoulders , whimpering , " So childish , nothing but a little cold on a good road , fine main highway , and me frightened like that ! But I was so lost and scared . But I 'm so glad I 'm with you ! " " Want a brandy ? " " Si , si , certo ! And a room that does n't keep sliding over into an abyss ! "  | " Can do . " " My mountaineer ! My valiant major ! " " Come on . " In the crowded barroom-restaurant the drinkers looked at Olivia with relish . Her color was Calabrian , but her unmelting eyes convinced them that she was not Italian but English , and from their fathers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English milords took walking trips in the mountains , they had heard that all Englishwomen are beautiful and mad . The landlady showed them the bedrooms : narrow , stonefloored , cold as outdoors . On each of the narrow beds was one of those Italian country quilts evidently stuffed with steel-filings and geology , which , though they are very heavy , on the other hand induce no warmth at all . But Olivia said gaily , " You would have your adventure ! You 'll have it tonight , sleeping in this Greenland igloo . But there 's a very nice sacred oleograph in each room . Bene ! " As they went back downstairs , through the partly open door of the third bedroom peered an old man with a fall of despondentmustache and an ancient cape gone gray-green . " Our fellow guest . He looks all right , " Hayden muttered . ( He was in Europe , he actually was in Italy , at an inn , at night , with his girl , with a man of cloaked mystery down the hall , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed in Newlife , sleepless , looking at the radium dial of his bedside clock ! ) Olivia insisted , " Oh , the old man is fine . Possibly just a little homicidal  --  believes that he is a soldier of Garibaldi and we are Austrians . . . . Of course you noticed that there are no locks on our bedroom doors . "  | " You can wedge a chair under the knob . " " Do n't be silly . I shall depend on you . " They had with them their bags , packed for Venice , but of any washing save with a can of hot water there was no prospect . In their glaring hunger , they did not care . " I never allow myself bath salts nor a bath thermometer , not even since I inherited the ten million , " she said cheerfully ; then : " But if we had gone off the road . . . " He stroked her cheek , and hastened to get into her the spiritual solace of hot noodle soup . The mountaineers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room and the landlady their private chef . They had spaghetti , veal cooked with mozzarella cheese , pink cake and pink local wine . By moving their table next to the pink terra-cotta stove , into which the landladykept stuffing brush roots , they were not cold  --  not intolerablycold just shivering a little . The mystery man in the cape came down to have his spaghetti , but he did not seem to be looking at them . He read in a small old leather-bound book . The dining room was also the lounge , and they sat at their table long after dinner . " Comfortable ? " Hayden said . He meant his voice to be only placid and encouraging , but it sounded tender . " Very ! You know , this place is n't really strange to me . It 's homelike  --  something warm and littered and casual about it . Sometimes I get tired of the cold chastity of my room at the Tre Corone . It 's just a hygienic waiting room for tired souls . Your room is better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost as bitterly neat as mine . "  | " What do you know about my room ? " " Oh , I look in every time I pass it . You have a neighborly wildwesternway of leaving your door open . " " I suppose I do . " He laughed at himself . " My pose is the solitaryscholar  --  the devout hermit  --  Marsilio Ficino  --  must n't be disturbed by anything  --  chase out the dog and strangle the children . And all the while I guess I want to hear those cheerful domestic noises : the cook smashing dishes and Vito Zenzero bawling out Perpetua for stealing the guests ' perfume and not saving any of it for him . And hoping that you will give me a Hello and come in . Why do n't you ? " " I do sometimes  --  in spirit  --  and have long grave talks with you . " " What do we say in those grave talks ? " " I ask your opinion , as an architect , on the merits of fan-vault-ing . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading to you my sister 's latest letter  --  evenings when I 'm a little homesick . " " Why do n't you ? " " I never get that homesick ! Oh , darling ... " " Yes ? " " Let 's not waste this one completely quiet evening  --  maybe the only one we 'll ever have  --  waste it in being chatty , " said Olivia . " I get worried about you . It 's impersonal , really , but it rises from such a liking for you , and respect . " As I heard Mr. Dodsworth say to you once , why do you let Europe get you ? For us Americans it 's a drug , a sleeping-draught , all made of poppies and the wonder of old , old civilizations andp240religions and dreams , so lulling after our brisk , raw climate at home , where we have to face the blizzard , fight through it or freeze . Go home , my dear ! " " Would you go back with me ? " " I ca n't . Europe has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in America I 'll always be an exile double-distilled . " The old man in the faded cape sighed to himself , " There is an American couple who are not glib and hustling , but true tenderlovers . Darling forgotten , we were like that , then ! " He rose , bowed good-night , and left them . " But you , " Olivia was urging Hayden , " can still go back to America uninfected . " " I 'm not so sure . I love Florence . It 's very much like you . I wonder sometimes if I 'll ever go home . With Caprice gone , I 'd be lonely there . " He realized with a jar that he ought never to speak of Caprice to Olivia . He hastened to cover it with a false-hearty , " In Florence there 's a kind of perpetual excitement ; not football-game excitementbut a blissful stir . I look in at some new church , or call on Nat Friar and listen to his newest lies about Sir Henry Belfont . He swears that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold the household wine and invested the swag in gambling houses . Or I go to the Dodsworths ' for bridge . But most of all , I can talk to you , after dinner  --  when you 're not being cold and repulsive . " " Am I cold sometimes ? " " And repulsive . " " Wonderful ! I try to be , so that I wo n't get found out as the embarrassed village tomboy I am at heart . And you 're still the village high-school hero : the basketball captain and tenor inp141your Episcopal choir and valedictorian , with such a thoughtful Commencement essay comparing Columbus and General Grant . That was a good life we knew as kids  --  so much more than the surface Florence that we see . It was as real as this mountain wind . Go back to it while you can . " " Would you mind if I left you ? " She looked at him full , ivory softly flushing , and murmured , " It would be very much safer for me if you left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cold , the , danger . She stretched her arms out on the table and dropped her head on them . She turned her pure , shadowy face toward him for a moment , with a funny , babyish smile , a defenseless smile all unlike her normal dignity , and went confidently off to sleep . He passed his hand over her head , her shoulders , her good arms , not actually touching them but seeming to follow a delicate invisible integument that sheathed her and kept her inviolate . Then , unmoving , he watched her . Time was abolished , time and space were only in her . And the landlady came heavily clumping and Olivia awoke . Hayden rather thought that , in her mountain accent , the landladywas saying , " Good night . When you get ready to go to bed , put out the lights in this room . Sleep well . " She leered at Haydenand thumped away and upstairs . " Uuuuuuuh , " yawned Olivia . " What did our hostess say ? " Olivia slowly sat straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things must come to an end and that it 's time for us to say good-night . "  |p142Suddenly  it all came over him . He bluntly moved his chair toward hers , put his arm round her , pulled her toward him . " Olivia ! I had been planning to make love to you  --  not planningit all day , not all our journey , but tonight , when you were soft and warm and near me . But something has hit me hard , something too basic to allow any experimental love-making . I do n't know  --  I think I may be desperately in love with you . And when I think of the dreadful thing I might have done in trying to tempt you , I 'm aghast ! I 'm not fit to love you . I 'm a murderer ! I murdered Caprice by my carelessness . I am not fit ! " She sprang up and he agitatedly rose to face her . Her voice was strained and fierce , with not one evasive civilized qualm in it . " You did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You told me about her  --  you 've told me much more than you knew  --  about her and about you . But if you had meant to kill her , I 'd be glad ! " " No ! " " I 'm glad you did ! I hate your damn , curly-headed , curlymindedleech , Caprice ! Sucking your blood  --  living on your kindness and your gentleness ! " " That 's not true ! She was plucky and gay .... " " She was a sneak thief of life ! " " Olivia ! " " O-liv-ia ! Professoressa Dottoressa Olivia ! That frump ! That good , safe , cautious doctor of frigidity ! She 's dead , too , and you murdered her , too  --  thank God ! The wild highlander in me has come to life again , in this wild , windy highland  --  thank God . Dearest Hayden , quit blaming yourself , quit smothering yourself ! I love you ! "  |p143Her  arms were round his neck and she was pressed against him before his hands locked behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restraints in her face were loosened , and she was as abandoned as the most feckless highland lass , and breathed as hard . She said nothing more , and they did not remember to turn off the lights in the dining room.  | THE morning sun was warm and shameless , and their eggs , consumed to a view of snowy Apennine peaks absurdly like piles of the best peach ice cream , had ozone in them  --  so Hayden asserted . They were chatty and they were smiling somewhat smugly , and did not even see an old man with a cape and a small Elzevir . " Looks as though we are to be beautifully married , " said Hayden . " Astonishingly enough , it does ! My lord and master , may I go on studying ? " " You are graciously permitted . Do you want to stay on in Italy , and maybe France and Holland and so on , for a few years ? " " Oh , a couple of years or so , if you can stick it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  our house ! I want to find out whether I 've learned so much about the terror and splendor of the Middle Ages that now I can become a halfway decent commonplace wife and do the job as well as Catherine Sforza would . Oh , yes , I shall love Newlife  --  in a controlled way ! "  | " We 'll build a Renaissance church there : " " What do you mean we will ? You will ! I 'm a simple , admiringwife now . I sha n't even give you any advice , ever . Whatever you do will seem wonderful to me . . . . Except just this . You are not to build any Renaissance churches or Gothic churches or Romanesque or anything else imitative of Europe . Go ahead and develop the American Georgian , as you planned . Stand for something ; do n't just copy . " He said meekly , " Yes , that might be  --  yes . " All the way to Florence , she sang Neapolitan lyrics and smoothed his sleeve . With a not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take their civic place , Olivia and Hayden were presently seen flauntingly together everywhere in Florence , at church , at the bars , walking on the Tornabuoni and the Lungarno . In the tight environment of their pensione , which was as close to them and sometimes as itchily intrusive as a hair shirt , they had not announced any engagement and they kept their separate tables , but their attachment must have been clear . Certainly it was to Vito Zenzero , clerk , headwaiter , and authorityon which countesses in town were authentic . Vito looked confidently at Olivia as he took her dinner order , and she seemed contented now to be accepted as merely a woman , betrayed and lost to scholarship and generally happy . Every time Hayden looked from his table to hers , he smiled and Olivia smiled and Vito smiled with them both , and Olivia was not offended . As a child , Hayden had devotedly trusted in his sturdy father , his fragile and fanciful mother . But from this serenity the neighborhoodbully , a foul brat , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been distrustful , constantly vigilant . Now , first since the dawn years , he felt , with Olivia , not only an arousing tension but a secure faith , in which his mind flowed smooth and full . He was proud of escorting this young woman , so wise , so warmly beautiful , so affectionate  --  but only to him . Her brown dress , which formerly had seemed merely serviceable and neat , was to him now a garment of singular gracefulness and fine fabric , and its choice showed his lady 's knowledge of the smart world . It seemed to him that her darkly pallid face was richer now with new fast blood . It must have seemed so to every one , for Mrs. Dodsworth observed , " You 're getting out more now , Olivia . You look much livelier for it . " And said Sam Dodsworth , " I used to be embarrassed with you two young highbrows , but you 've become as simple-hearted a couple as I ever saw . Glad of it . Edith claims that we old married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . Do n't you two let me down , like a lot of undependable young pups these days  --  eight different engagements and two divorces in five years . You two stick ! " " We 'll stick ! " proclaimed Hayden , and Olivia looked complaisant  --  though , to be precise , their betrothal was most undefined , with such unromantic business as deciding when and where they would be married scarcely discussed . But the ardor between them certainly had not lessened and , in the pallid cautiousnessof the Tre Corone boarding house as in the wild inn , they roused each other to an ardor that sometimes frightened Hayden . " You seem changed , somehow , " they all said to Olivia  --  Tessie Weepswell , the prima donna of bridge , Mrs. Manse , Prince Ugop147Tramontana , and if Vito Zenzero did not say it , his eyes said it for him . Most of them all , Hayden was startled by it . Olivia was a good workman ; she was as steadily about her subway labors at the libraries as ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally willing to sit long over red Chianti at lunch , and in every inch of her , as Hayden lovinglysurveyed her , he found her blood more torrential  --  in movinglips , in hot cheeks , in firmly grasping hands . It was particularly at Nat Friar 's house that they were accepted as a Young Couple . Not for many years had the once-gallant young Nathaniel Greenleaf Friar of Boston been an adventurous amorist . Nowadays he looked upon passion as he looked upon assassination : as a diversion that had been fashionable in the MiddleAges , and very useful , but of which , surely , there had been enough by i600 . At supper for the Young Couple , served on his living-room table cleared of books and pipes , with a noble San Daniele ham , Nat smiled and teased his beard , and addressed Hayden : " I suppose I must give my sanction to the dangerous exploit that Dr. Lomond and you are contemplating . People still do get married , do they ? I thought they all got tired of it about twenty-five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost tolerable institution for groundlings who have nothing else to keep them annoyed and occupied in the long evenings , but I have never commended it for scholars . All through my life I have had acquaintances who dashed in howling , Nat , you need some one to take care of you , and I 've found just the woman for you ! ' Then they drag in some weedy virgin or unwieldy widow whose ambition is to be supportedin return for such caretaking as hiding my slippers wherep148I can never find them , or quarreling with my maid , whom I have cherished for fifteen years , and replacing her with a fancy male who cooks with butter and collects even more than the legal illegalcommission of ten per cent on all shopping . These solitary animals who call themselves scholars '  --  they should never marry . And Ada will agree . " " You , " said Mrs. Shaliston Baker , gently , " are the most selfish , loquacious and untidy old barbarian living . " " Uncle Nat , " said Olivia , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynical , too , but now I can see that there may be a betterreason for living than just a knowledge of Etruscan tombs . " " If you two women really believed any of that , you would really kill me and not just babble about it , when I make so basic an attack on your sex , when I judiciously point out that a wife 's notion of being a faithful helpmate is to be willing to wait while you are paying the bill for the mink coat she has swindled out of you . But no woman believes in Women . When I attack your faction , you both gloat . " " Oh , pooh ! " said Olivia . " And you , Hayden , you agree with me , or presently will . " Startled , Hayden wondered about that . He admitted to himself that he was sometimes a little edgy over the panting watchfulnesswhich the changed Olivia now kept over him . He had been so free ! Among the yodeling witnesses to their bliss , none was more fervid than those new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vito Zenzero had named them , were middle-agedtwin American ladies . They had been well paid for divorcing uncouth husbands who were in trade  --  shoes andp149wholesale plumbing ; who were not , in short , " creative . " Creativewas the Grenadiers ' favorite word . It was creative to sell antiques but not plumbing . The Grenadiers came from Pennsylvania , but they had lived long in England , in Bloomsbury boarding houses , and they said " lift "  --  when they remembered it  --  and hoped to be taken for English . They took photographs all day long . They had also lived in Carmel , Taos , Taxco , Greenwich Villageand Montparnasse , tracking down not so much Culture as the creative and romantic dealers in Culture : ballet-dancers , summer-theaterdirectors , fiddlers . They had now moved their field station to Florence . They took photographs all day long and showed them to you all evening long . They were unbeatable at coursing through churches , galleries , art shops , and they took buses out to Prato and the Certosa . They had picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American student but whose studies were only of bars . They introduced him as " such an ardent , creative talent  --  he speaks seven languages  --  he just hates America ! " Whichever the seven languages may have been , they did not include any Italian , nor much English beyond , " Actually , " " Amusing " and " Oh , my dears . " The Grenadiers ' burlesque of his own Culture-stalking made Hayden want to go home , where he would cultivate not this quarter-knowledge of history but his full and accurate knowledge of Newlife ; where he could tell you , offhand , just how much 12,758 Schuyler Boulevard would bring per front foot , and who was the father of the wife of the third baseman of the Newlifep150team . He denied his own denial ; he insisted that his white nights of outwatching the Bear had been fruitful , but he was learning what older and wearier practitioners of scholarship and the arts all learn : that their worst enemy is the rich female amateur . Hayden could endure the winter cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he could not endure the approval of the Grenadier Sisters when they bubbled to him , " We do think that your engagement to Dr. Olivia is the most romantic thing we ever saw . It 's truly creative : an architect who appreciates how vulgar most Americans are marrying a woman scholar who knows how many gardeners Lorenzo Mag-nifico kept at his villa ! " Put that way , Hayden saw his interest in Olivia as fairly sickening . " But , Mr. Chart , " croaked the Grenadiers , " you 'll have to watch your step . Very few of you men have the chance to be the consort of Dr. Olivia  --  such a rare woman and she can put it over any of you men , and you got to admit it , when it comes to creative ability . You may be so efficient and all that , but here you have to take a back seat . We 'll bet a cookie , if Olivia quits her teaching job when you get married , she 'll step right out on the lecture platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with thousands of people listening to her , hundreds anyway , when she explainswhat St. Catherine and St. Francis and Boccaccio and all those deep thinkers were thinking ! You let us tell you , Mister Man , you 'll have to be content to share her with the world ! " He brooded to himself , " Perhaps an uninspired routine draftsmanlike me would feel more secure with a woman who is n't in danger of being intoxicated by the limelight and the microphonep151and fools like these sisters . No ! Nonsense ! That 's half treachery and half idiocy . Dear Olivia , she would never ride a soundtruckin the public square ! " And Olivia joined him in ridiculing the Grenadiers ' proprietorshipof the good , the true and the beautiful , but one evening she listened unsnickering when they gushed , " Oh , Dr. Olivia , you 've got to excuse us if we bore you by raving so about you . We do love Culture , oh , we think it 's simply wonderful , and so much needed , but we 're just amateurs compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Olivia murmured , " Me ? I 'm a schoolma'am who was lucky in having hardboiled teachers . " But she did listen while the Grenadiers gave her the useful information that she was a mistress of medieval law and as beautiful as Clarice Orsini . Hayden noted that the Olivia who once , after the pensione dinner , had taken coffee alone at her table and then flitted off to her barricaded cell , was staying on for coffee in the lounge , and now and then holding forth to eye-brightened circles on what was really worth seeing in Florence . When the North Italy agent for the Little Dandy Tractors of Moline said to her admiringly , " Say , Doctor , there 's one thing I never could get straight about these doggone Middle Ages  --  maybe you can tell me , " then Olivia did tell him , and she did not look at an impatient Mr. Hayden Chart off in a corner.  |p152SO  M E W H A T less than four weeks after their mountain inn , four weeks during which Hayden had tried to march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dined at Paoli 's , in their familiar escutcheon-brightened corner , " Darling , there 's one quite important thing you might do for me . " " It 's done . " " I want to go to lunch at Sir Henry Belfont 's some more . " " That pompous old fake ? You said you never wanted to seehim again . You disliked him even more than I did . " " I have reasons . " " But how could I arrange it ? I ca n't phone him and say we want a change from the Tre Corone boiled tongue and spinach , and how much does he charge ? " " No ! Do n't try that . He might take you seriously and take us as boarders and he 'd charge enough to ruin us . Whatever the old pot may be , I 'm sure he knows how to make it pay . . . . As you 'll make it pay , my ardent young architect , when I 've looked over your setup in Newlife and probably fired your partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! With Henry , it will be extremely easy . Call him up and invite him and Lady Belfont to lunch at some cheap trattoria  --  be sure and give him the name of the place . He 'd hate it . So he 'll haw a little and then ask if he ca n't invite you and Dr. Lomond  --  you know that lovely Livy ?  --  to his place instead . " " Do you really want to go there and listen to him tell how well he knows the Queen of Saxony and His Serene Grace , the Sixteenth Duke of Brabant ? " " Well now , Henry knows a lot about Italian painting , at least a quarter as much as Prince Ugo . And he 's very rich and vain . If I could get him interested in our art gallery at my university  --  I have a not entirely silly hope that when we 're married and I break my university connections , they may make a new post for me : lecturer on history and only have to go there a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . And they might name the lecturership after me . " " You 'd be away from Newlife that long ? " " You could come along and listen , if you wanted to . " " Yes  --  yes ... " " Anyway , there 's no sense in your inverted snobbery about Sir Henry . He may come in very useful . Imagine him coming to visit at the university while I 'm there , and me introducing the old windbag to the president and the students . They 'd be so impressed by his tenth-rate title . And then maybe he 'll give us the art gallery . So run along now and do as I tell you , and do n't argue . " " Have you such a definite expectation of being bored in Newlife  --  orrather , with me  --  that you 're already sketching an emergencyexit ? "  | " I 'll adore every minute with you , and I expect to run our servants like a sergeant major . But you know that with the academicwork I 've done , I do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suppose we do n't have any servants to run and we have to do our own housework , you and I together ? You 've urged me to freelance , and that may not mean much money for quite a while . " " Then you 'll need my help more than ever , need me making a little money , too . Darling , why are you so difficult today , so argumentative ? You are n't usually . " " This whole business of catering to a poop like Belfont revolts me . A little while ago you would have scorned the thought of toadying to him . You would have slapped down anybody who suggested that you would ever be willing to introduce him to your president  --  whom you also despise ! " " My dear , that scrupulous Dr. Lomond  --  the chilly , opinionatedold prig !  --  is gone , and I 'm another woman . You ought to know . You certainly contributed enough to the change . And you ca n't have me both the shrinking virgin and the bold earthy lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip in and phone ! " The telephonic swindling worked out as the shrewd new Olivia had planned . Sir Henry shuddered at the thought of meetingnormal Italians at a restaurant , and he lavishly invited Hayden and Olivia to the Villa Satiro . They drove up in the topolino , which again caused an aggravatedspasm of agony in the butler , who was a cheap reprint of Sir Henry , not bound in the original eyebrows . As they descended , out from a taxicab just arrived frisked a stalwart and handsome young man over whom Olivia fluttered ,  | " What a beautiful animal he is ! A Lombard knight , without fear and splendidly without brains . I can place him within a decade or two : 875 A.D. , I think . " He was almost certainly an American , with a look about him of Scandinavian ancestry : an extremely large young man in his early thirties . Over his fresh-looking tweeds a light topcoat was slung from his shoulders like a cape . He was hatless , with an exuberance of flaxen hair . Hayden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Olivia , thought that with a show of knighthood he combined a suggestion of a college football star , of a vacuum-cleaner salesman , and of a popular singing evangelist shouting jazz piety . The stranger waved his wide hand to them and entered the villa after them , in the manner of royalty standing aside for aged peasants . Sir Henry met them in the hall and said to Olivia , as though nobly amused , " I seem to be specializing today in you streamlinedYankee scholars . You are all so very brisk about cartelizing facts and diagrams that you make a shy old British putterer like me seem incorrigibly provincial . " This young gentleman who has charged in with you is ProfessorLundsgard  --  Professor Lorenzo Lundsgard  --  till recently the French and Spanish don at Huguenot University , which is somewhere in your Southern states . " He has resigned , and I understand that he is to devote himself to the study of our wistful Italian culture , which nowadays is so unused to being wooed by anyone so resolute and twittering with dawn as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lundsgard , a man who calls himself President Sleman of Huguenot informs me that our youthful friend is ap156'stimulating teacher and an accomplished scholar , who will stir up the sleeping Tuscan lions . ' That is a spectacle that I shall very much enjoy . . . . Dr. Lundsgard , this your rival lion-stirrer , Dr. Olivia Lomond of the University of  --  Winnemac , I believe it is called . Oh . And Mr. Chart . " Then he let them go in to lunch . Lady Belfont was also there , though this is noted , like the day 's temperature , only as a matter of record . As they wavered in to face the butler and the footman , standinglike the Sphinx and the largest pyramid , Hayden noted how gallantly Lundsgard smiled at Olivia , and how sharply he sized her up . Her smile in return was warmed by a flirtatiousness which six weeks ago she would have denounced as cheap . He saw , too , how the beige vicuna sweater which Lundsgard wore for waistcoat managed on his hearty torso to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun through the lofty windows brought out metallic lights in his rough , corn-colored hair . The five of them , plus the inescapable Marchesa Valdarno , sat prim about the refectory table of Irish oak , eating their molds of rice with duck livers served on English plates with views of Kent , while Belfont , with what he felt to be gentlemanly but learned humor , pumped Lundsgard , who answered with goodheartedsimplicity . " I 'm afraid I ca n't claim to be any kind of a real scholar , Sir Henry . Fact , in college , I was more devoted to football , but I had a sneaking worship for learning , especially old history . Like a dumb farmer seeing a vision of chariots in the August sky , and , not daring to even try and explain them . Oh , I did get my Phi Beta Kappa key , along with my letter in two sports , but that was , an accident . "  | ( " This fellow is probably my own age , but he seems much fresher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olivia , who was fixed on Lundsgard , her lips open . ) " In the War I served in North Africa ; a very high-ranking corporal I was , till they demoted me to second looey , and I got laid up with nothing more than a fool machine-gun wound in one foot . While I was convalescing , I got acquainted with French cafe society there and learned a little of the lingo . Then I got hit again , really awful light , but they invalided me out and I went home and got my Ph.D . in Romance languages  --  never very good at them , either ! But I got a job teaching in that little universityand , by coaching football and taking the president 's son out duck-hunting , I got by . " Then a sort of ridiculous thing happened . I was spending a Christmas vacation with a friend , and right out of the blue , a movie producer offered me a job acting  --  as a young cop in a Big City picture , and then couple of Westerns . Seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cents ! Now here 's the funny thing . It was n't at any college but on the lot in Hollywood that I first heard the Gospel of Beauty , from a grand old script writer who had been a playwright in Hungary . " I started reading about the Middle Ages , and then by chance , which is sometimes so kind to a heavy-handed duffer like me , I was in -a Middle Ages costume play , and I was sold on history complete . The actor and halfback scholar ! " Lundsgard thundered with laughter , in which they vaguely joined . ( " Olivia is looking at him like a Fond Mother . " ) " Oh , I 'm a fighting fool for study . Sir Henry , I 've read all yourp158essays on Tuscan Art , and personally I think they 're much more profound than Bernard Berenson . Much ! " Sir Henry looked lavish . That made two people who thought so . " I have a pretty definite idea in coming here . I want to prepare myself to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublime importance of authority , and I want to hand on to them at the same time the lofty philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas , the magnificence of Lorenzo , the reverence of Savonarola , and through it all , the superworldly quality of Lead-ership . " " Ah , " condescended Sir Henry . " And in America , where any garageman thinks himself just as good as a bank president , we so lack the phenomenon of sanctified and yet forceful Leadership . And as a pioneer , I may do something to create it . " ( " The man is a fool . But Olivia looks as if she likes him . But cannibal sandwich with laurel trimmings is not my meat . " ) " All of you clever people " said Lundsgard , " will think I am a ridiculous bumpkin , but I do have some plans that are awfully exciting . My agent is planning a huge lecture tour for me , on six subjects , including Mysticism and Leadership and  --  and this is something new  --  the lectures are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to script , about the Medicis , with the lead played by Rupert Osgoswold  --  or possibly by your humble servant ! " Olivia muttered , so softly that it was heard only by Hayden , " Very exciting ! " Lundsgard caroled on , " The president of Cornucopia Films  --  do you know that outfit , Sir Henry ? "  | " My boy , I am much too secluded and timid to understand the neologies of the cinema , but it does happen that my Man of Business , in London , has invested some small sums for me in Cornucopia . " " Well , that 's dandy . Maybe you 'll be interested in the fact that the president of Cornucopia is going to town on this , and he 's advanced a big wad to finance my work here . Being such a stupid guy and having so little time , I have to depend on assistants  --  photographersand secretaries and researchers and so on . But Cornucopia agrees with me that we must not think of this as a money-making project  --  though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand bucks a week ! But we think of it as a public service , to improve the mental stamina and subtletyof America . A great friend of my father and , I am honored to say , of mine , a United States Senator who carries a lot of weight on the Foreign Relations Committee , believes that my crusade for more authority and leadership might both elevate our restless American morals and improve our standing everywhereabroad . That goes to show there are people who see our crying need ! " Sir Henry , I realize how fortunate I am to be allowed to see the Villa Satiro . I have read a little of its history as well as the book of its present owner . I am honored ! " Lundsgard turned on Sir Henry , on the Marchesa Valdarno , on Olivia a smile full of soul and sunshine , the smile of a brave young ambassador who loves battle and smitings , but also loves little children and quotations from Alice in Wonderland . He chanted , By myself , I never could learn much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetic outdoor man . What I 'd like to do , Sir Henry , is to ask an occasional question of a veteranp160like you , and perhaps of Dr. Lomond , of whose accomplishmentsI have heard . " In a quarter-hour of well-padded if not particularly wellturnedsentences , Sir Henry said , Yes , the Middle Ages and the Renaissance make clear the horrors of this so-called Democracy . Civilization ended with the Fall of the Bastille . Aristocracy means the Rule of the Best , and how sadly we need that amid the clamorous and greedy herd of Britain , and no doubt of your America . To all this delirium Lundsgard listened with attention , and Hayden reflected that good listeners are to good talkers as one to ten . His Olivia listened also . Hayden had heard her hold forth on the wickedness of the popularizers who condense a five-hundred-page book on Einstein into a two-page article including three racy anecdotes and a thumb-nail drawing of a relativitized cow . She liked her books thick and close-printed and accurate about their geography , and she had demanded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she was now looking tenderly at a man who was going to lecture on philosophy in the Rose Bowl . Sir Henry was bestowing on Lundsgard an invitation to frequenthis villa , use his books , come and have lunch with Prince Ugo . " And I shall write to the president of Cornucopia , " said Sir Henry , " my approval of your Crusade . " Running over with gratitude , Lundsgard took leave . Olivia ' burst out , " Have you a taxi coming , Mr. Lundsgard ? I 'm sure Mr. Chart would be glad to give you a lift in his funny little flivver . " " Splendid , Doctor ; much obliged , " said Lundsgard.  |p161But  Hayden was thinking , " It is n't funny and it is n't a fiivver . It has a powerful motor and sweet steering , and how you 're goingto get your fat carcass into it , Lundsgard , I do n't know . " But aloud , " Surely . Of course . Thank you for a beautiful lunch  --  Lady Belfont . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigarettes , his Scotch , even his fine large linen handkerchiefs ; how she would insist to a guest after a party , at three on a winter morning , " Oh , do n't phone  --  Hay will be glad to drive you home ! "  |p162BY  SITTING sidewise in the back of the topolino and not daring to breathe , Lundsgard was perilously carted down into town . Olivia turned her head to discourse with him most of the way , while Hay drove and sulked . She commented : " I do think your plan is a little wild , Mr. Lundsgard , but ... " Lundsgard shouted , " Listen , baby , I hate this formality among us Yanks , even when we 're in Europe . I wish you 'd call me Lorenzo , or maybe Lorry . I 'm certainly going to call you Livy , even if you are a top-flight history shark , and if your boy friend do n't slap me down for it , I 'll call him Hay . Okay , Doc ? Be friendly to the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very well . " Never had Hayden called her anything more loose than Olivia ; never , he remembered , even in tenderness , had she called him anything but Mr. Chart and then Hayden . " But Lorry , " she burst out , " do you actually think you can make ecclesiastical art and thought as simple to Main Street as the rules of croquet ? " " Maybe not , but it 's worth taking a shot . Holy smoke , don'tp163you think all this deep stuff , even in my bum version of it , will be better for the American hoi pollois than a lot of crime and sex stories ? Huh , darling ? " And to Hay 's profound gloom , the tawny lily , the one-time nun of learning , answered , " Yes , I do . " " Say , folks , " Mr. Lundsgard gurgled , " from all I can learn , the average age of the Anglo-American Colony here must be about sixty-five . Kick me out if I get intrusive , but I do hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Say , come see my office at the Excelsior . Maybe it 'll hand you a good laugh . It 's pretty commercial for a highbrow crusader , but if I 'm going to collect as many facts about Florence in couple months as that old gasbag , Belfont , has in maybe twenty years , I 've got to have a regular assembly-belt . I 've got Rome down cold in my notes and snapshots , and some Venice and Ravenna , and now it 's Florry 's turn . . . . Listen , I sound brash , but I 'm awful in earnest . Come on ! " Mr. Lundsgard was extremely appealing , yet all the while his sun-shot basso was extremely dominating . He leaned forward to pat Olivia 's shoulder , and the priestess of the chill twilight let his hand lie there for a minute . From a second bedroom in Lundsgard 's large suite at the Excelsior , all bedroom furniture had been removed , and he had turned it into one of the briskest offices Hayden had ever seen . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typists ' desks , with a dictation phonograph beside her , a young woman secretary was working . On an oak table in the center were at least fifty books on Italian history , with quarterly reviewsin four languages  --  not looking much perused . An enor/mous filing-cabinet had on its various drawers such tasty but unexpectedlabels as " Anecdotes of Famous Dukes , " " Clothing , Houses &; Dec. , " " Jewels &; Furs , " " Manners , Morals in Med . Courts , " " Beautiful Bits from Poets , Philosophers , " " Hunting Leopards , Falcons , Methods of Execution , " " Horses , Heroism . " On one wall was a bulletin board to which a youngish Italian with dark hair and a wise , thin face was pinning snapshots of Florentine palaces , city walls , armor from the museums . He looked like an educated cousin of Vito Zenzero , a cousin who could read the telephone book without moving his lips . " This is Angelo Gazza , my photographer  --  best photographer in Italy , " said Lundsgard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and chummed with the Yankee troops here . Speaks English by the book . He saves my life . I see a historic bit , or quaint , beautiful or native . I always have Angelo following me and Snap ! and he gets the local color for me even better than my notes . . . . Angelo , this is Dr. Lomond and Mr. Chart . They 'll give us a lot of pointers about what to see in Florry . We 'll be plenty grateful to ' em . " Gazza nodded . If he was grateful now , he did not show it . Nor was the secretary , when Lundsgard introduced her , particularlycordial . She had a fine face , but it was too varnished , too reminiscent of the Marchesa Valdarno , and her hair was a slide of smooth ash-blond . She seemed hard and competent , but the near-green eyes which sized up Olivia had in them resentmentand suffering . " This is Miss Hoxler , Evelyn Hoxler , or Mrs. Baccio , if you prefer . She 's true-blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to a fine young Italian businessman , friend of mine ,  |p165Art  Baccio ; lives in Rome . She just loves this art work . Hey , Evelyn ? " " Yes , " said Miss Hoxler , and it was as sullen a sound as the cry of a marsh bird . " She 's unquestionably the finest stenog in Italy , in both Italian and English . She never forgets an engagement  --  or lets me forgetone . Hey , Evelyn ? " " Yes ? " said Miss Hoxler , and went back to typing , and the machine sounded profane . " Well , children , we 'll go in and have a drink . " Mr. Lundsgard markedly did not include Gazza or Miss Hoxler in his invitation . He shut the door between the office and his living room . A portable bar had been set up ; one rich in bourbon , rye and French brandy . As he mixed a highball , Lundsgard snarled , " That confounded Hoxler woman is a good machine-pounder , but she 's getting altogether too independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he 's the most wishy-washy excusefor a man you ever saw . I found a job for him , in an office , but do you think he appreciates it ? Well , a man who tries to do something for mankind gets to expect ingratitude . The real trouble with most folks is that they have n't got any insight . " And Olivia apparently agreed . Lundsgard was bountiful in suggestions for things they three could do together : excursions to near-by villages ; and if Hayden was not enthusiastic about the implication that he and his good little topolino would be at their constant service , Olivia was . None of Lundsgard 's jolly objectives was new to her but she greeted them with apparent surprise and delight.  |p166That  night , late , in Hayden 's room , he was as harsh with her as his tenderness would permit . She was tired , her eyes were print-tired , and she stretched out in his deepest chair , relaxed , while he sat primly straight and interrogated her , with an ugly memory of a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You like this fellow , Lundsgard ? " " Like him , dear ? How do you mean ? He has so much buoyancyand freshness . They 're really charming to a tired old lady like me , and even his amusing ignorances . He 's so naive . " " That 's your favorite word . " " Well , it 's the favorite quality among the few men who are attracted by a dried-up old maid like me . " " Not noticeably dried-up now ! " They smiled together . " Livy ! ' This fellow is a clinker . We may see too much of him , " protested Hayden . Clinker was one of their private words . It had been an inventionof Hayden , along with smoother , and he had worked out a Doctrine of Clinkers . He may have been thinking of preoil-heatingdays and how hard it was to get a burnt-out coal , a clinker , out of a furnace grate . Clinkers are those newly arrived persons , not friends or their close kin or people likely to become friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends of friends , or complete strangers , who come bounding into your particular Florence or your Newlife with letters of introduction , or merely with a telephone call or a note on hotel stationery , announcing , " You 've probably never heard of me but I know the sister-in-law of the nephew of a great friend of yours . I 'm here only for three days ,  |p167but  I thought I might have the pleasure of shaking your hand and buying you a cocktail . " Which , in Florence , meant that they expected a free cocktail , a free meal , an escorted tour of the city , and perhaps introductionsto Prince Ugo and Sam Dodsworth . They would also accepta trip to Siena and your assistance in all their shopping . As many clinkers came to Newlife as to Florence , but there , at least , they could speak the language and buy their own cigarettes . It is the supposition of all clinkers that the chief purpose of any Americans in coming all the way to Florence is to spend all his time there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no implication that clinkers are persons of low manners . They may be virtuous lodge-members and favorite honorary pall-bearers , soft-voiced and informed about astronomy and the history of West Point . But in quantities of more than one a season , they are appalling nuisances . Frequently they believe that they are being benefactors to what they call " lonely exiles . " One of them clacked to Hayden on the telephone , " Course I 've never met you , but I said to myself , What the hell ! Hay 'll be tickled to death to see an American face , I guess ! ' " Olivia sat up to protest , " That 's unfair . Lorry is n't a clinker . He 's going to stay here and be one of us  --  whatever that means  --  delicate connoisseurs , I suppose ! " " There is nothing delicate about your Lorry : Playful he is , powerful he is , and a good drinking-man . He 'll die of apoplexy at fifty . But delicate ? No ! " " So much the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going at it with an earnestness and yet a humility that may take him far . He 's really touching . And he does n't take himself too seriously ; he has a divine , rough humor about his own deficiencies . He may become quite a fair scholar . " " Maybe  --  if he is n't entirely a charlatan . " " Why are you so intolerant ? " " With this fellow , frankly , I 'm a little jealous , of him . I did n't expect you  --  oh , you say you 're changed , but it was n't so long ago that you were the coolest judge of bumptiousness I ever met , and I did n't expect you to get so girlish over a ham actor playing a professor . A real crush ! " " Oh , pooh ! " " I agree . " " Honestly , Hayden , you astonish me , being jealous when I 'm merely amused by the antics of a good-hearted climber . I take Lorry about as seriously as I do that cocker spaniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't recognize Lorry if I saw him tomorrow . " She did protest too much , thought Hayden . Was there a faint stink of treachery ? He urged : " I 'd better get my patent on you filed , quick . " " What am I ? An invention ? " " Of the devil ! There is a sort of theory that we are engaged to be married , which seems to me a surprisingly good idea , but we have never much discussed when or what afterward . Ca n't we be married this summer , and take a look at the Alps and maybe Austria , and then in the fall we 'll decide whether we want to go home or stay on in Europe ? What about it ? " " I 'm willing , though I do think one of the charms of our friendship has been that we have n't had a lot of family around top169drive us into a marital schedule , so they can order their wedding garments early . Ca n't we still just drift , for a while yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evasiveness which dismayed him but the discoveryin himself of relief that she was evading fixed terms , and that he was not yet going to be tied down to definiteness . If it had not been for the threat to Olivia 's unstable emotions , he might have liked Lundsgard for his backwoods humor . The three had comfortable outings at the enticing country restaurantsat Maiano and Pratolino and St. Casciano and sat there on outdoor terraces for hours . Olivia mockingly called Lundsgard the " Dazzling Dane " and explained to him that it is not enough to qualify as an authority to know that Italy is a peninsula and that the Medicis were bankers . Lundsgard took it affably , and he danced with Olivia in arbors to the melody of accordions . He was taken up by the peerage of the American Colony with unexpected speed . He had a way of telling retired gentlemen whose only vocabularies were of the Stock Exchange how profoundthey were about international politics , and of looking at their wives with reverence and surprise . He had a competent game of bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to symptoms , which caused Hayden to wonder if his story of untutored country boyhood was quite truthful . On his own , Lundsgard gave a party which marked him as not just an acceptable eighth for dinner , but as a social factor of merit . He hired three suites at the Excelsior for the evening ; in one , he had the bridge-players , in one the more thoughtful boozers , in the third there was dancing to a Swiss orchestra in Bulgarian costumes playing Brazilian tunes . Even the testiestp170Colonists advanced from bridge to the bar and a few even to the samba , and Lundsgard was considered a man of the rarest parts . Thereafter , the juicy seventeen-year-old granddaughters of the exiled bankers , who now and then visited Florence , clamored for the presence of Lundsgard . Along with the pillars , Lundsgard got in with the dubious and unexplained who make up an interesting part of all the foreign colonies in Florence and of the Italians . who are close to them : mysterious owners of villas gorgeous but secluded ; exofficialsof the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II and millionaires afterward ; royalty in exile ; Italians in whose presence it was not considered tactful to mentiondope-running ; men sometimes grave and solid seen usually with men young and pretty . In Florence , even the patently proper British and Americans are often inexplicable . With so many demure ladies you never quite know whether they are widows , divorced or still married and of what sort their husbands ' grandparents had been . And with all these ( since he did not , like Hayden , have to stay home evenings and study , having his Miss Evelyn Hoxler to do that for him ) Lundsgard cruised , blithe and free , generally popular , and Hayden reflected that there is no more useful pose than that of the honest yokel of whom it would be a shame to take advantage . However much Hayden doubted Lundsgard , it was a season when clinkers were trooping into town , and any tested permanentacquaintance was a refuge . Olivia and Hayden and Lundsgardescaped from tourists on frequent mountain picnics , and it was on one of these that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize them.  |p171LUN  D S G A R D was a skilled picnic guest . He scrupulouslyfetched his share of the lunch , paid for his share of the gasoline , and once , when there was a tire to be changed , he pushed Hayden aside and did all the changing . . . . Hayden ungratefullythought that their family Tristan was somewhat too buoyantand powerful about it . Though probably a year older than Hayden , he contrived to look more youthful . Nowadays he usually called Olivia " Sister , " " Cookie " or " Helena Troy . " They picknicked today up above Settignano in a grove of olive and apple trees , with a venerable castle nearby , and the towers and low houses of Florence far below . Throughout lunch  --  cold duck and bread and butter and red wine and cheese with dates and raisins  --  Lundsgard was jovially teasing Olivia about her feebleness . He insisted that she had studied so much that she was unable now to walk two blocks . She lost all detachment and shouted at Lundsgard , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impress , that in college she could have been woman track champion if she had taken the time for training.  | " Okay , let 's see how good you are , Cutie ! " bellowed Lundsgard . " I 'll race you down to that old olive tree with the trunk rotted through . " It is not at all certain that Lundsgard let her win the race ; he was a little cumbersome and wavering , while the Diana of the Laurentian Library was astonishingly fleet . She did win , and they came back up the hillside laughing , innocently swinging hand in hand . But the uncomfortable Hayden wondered whether it was so innocent . There are things other than purloined letters that are most artfully concealed by exposing them . But the two returned to him so clear-eyed and so candidly laughing that he felt rebuked . He and his suspicions had it out at three o'clock that night . He had awakened in the darkness to a memory which tore at him , of Olivia 's eyes utterly fixed on this lout , the tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not sleep again . Could he ever sleep again ? In his old dressing-gown and soft worn Pullman slippers he padded over to the marble-topped table and , with his little Meta stove , he made coffee , served with condensed milk . No , he thought calmly , he was not the typical suspicious husband , with a vanity which made him surprised that his wife could like any other male at all , when she was so blessed as to have his divine favor . There was no suspicion about it ; he was coldly and wretchedly sure that Olivia could surrender to this lusty Lundsgard animal ; the question was whether she had done so now , and whether she would now go on succumbing to a dreary line of sneak thieves afterward . " I coaxed her out of the cold tomb and warmed her . Did I dop173that only for the benefit of n't stand her even laughing with a lively acquaintance ! She 's as single-minded in love as .. . " She 's a reckless fool , she 's uncontrollable when she takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear Professor Leslie Vintner 's versionof their affair ! At least , Caprice was dependable that way . She never more than flirted at a dance . . . . I do n't think she did . . . . Of course there are some flabby , whimpering individualswho were born to be cuckolded . . . . Oh , go back to bed , Chart ! Ca n't you get enough torture without making a hobby of it ? " When the three lunched next , Hayden could not resist probingthe campus Casanova about his opinion of this recently discoveredworld-menace , Sex . Lundsgard had often confided that he had never been married , and now he was frank and unsparing of himself . He had been fervently engaged , he said , to a " cute little chick and awful smart " at Huguenot University , but he admitted that in his ruthlessyouth he had been cruel to this young lady . He had scolded her for not rising to the splendor of his ambition to be a lord of learning  --  at several thousand dollars a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon . I was n't a big enough , rich enough soul then to appreciate a gentle little saint like Bessie and be patient with her . " But his humility quickly ran out , and he hinted that in Hollywoodand Rome he had been favored by the handsomest and most befurred women . And Olivia , Hayden marked , was notp174angered by this rakishness . She listened to Lundsgard 's advertisingwithout one of the crisp comments , flavored with mustardand pepper and ice , for which she had once been dreaded . " I 'd better get her out to Newlife quick ! " thought Hayden . At the Tre Corone , now , she did not merely tolerate Vito 's insinuatingcroons . Hayden heard Vito mutter that they might go out to a night club , and though she refused , she was not haughty . Even at the Villa Satiro , to which they were often invited for lunch now , along with Lundsgard , she was not above a sly confidencewith Sir Henry , who wagged his fat back and leaned over her with the coyness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ponderous way of being salaciousby referring to the reprehensible doings of the less respectableGrecian gods . Hayden wondered whether Olivia would be spiritually advancing or declining if she switched from Lundsgard'sboisterous salesmanship to Sir Henry 's soggy glory . Yet now , when he was most distressed by her base transmutation , Hayden was most held by her ardent love , and the once simple Tre Corone boarding-house had become for him a splendor of heaven edged with infernal gloom . Then the cable from his partner , Jesse Bradbin , from New-life : " Big deal pending you required stop . Big dough quit being irresponsible come home next boat . " It tempted him to think of leaving paradise and all the heavy proprieties demanded in an angel , and of being busy and important in Newlife again ; of not having to remember historicaldates or impress the Dodsworths or shepherd his ewe lamb lest she fall over the most obvious cliffs . He could smell thep175Rocky Mountain air , heady with sage instead of olives . And he owed something to his fatuous yet devoted partner . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts from his worthy rivals in business . He refreshed his love by reviewing the virtues of Olivia . Remember , he coached himself , what unexampled beauty and courageand knowledge she has . You must be patient while she is getting over her first real fling , which she takes so much the worse because , at nearly thirty , she 's new to it . Would Jesse Bradbin ever give up anything he greatly wanted for him ? His cabled lie was warm and polite . It was harder for him to snub Lundsgard because the man , with a breezy humbleness , was always turning to him for advice . And once he said , " I wish you 'd get in on some of this movie dough , Hay , by doing a little research for me , in your spare time . " It was amiably said and amiably refused.  |p176H  E Y were dining , Hayden and Olivia , with Nat Friar and his love , Mrs. Shaliston Baker . The dinner , served on Nat 's living-room table imperfectly cleared of books and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curried shrimp and tiny strawberries , but Nat was less bland . He was restless , he spilled the wine , and Ada Baker watched him nervously , like a little old cat watching its good but alarming friend , the woolly setter . Their example made Hayden and Olivia unusually gentle with each other . When Nat said , " After you two young people are married , as Ada and I have never had the courage to be , you must n't stay in the cautious splendor of Florence but try the world , " then Olivia put out her hand , to let it lie relaxed in Hayden 's . Hayden explained the tidal phenomenon of Lorenzo Lundsgard , whom Nat had never seen . " He has depressing energy and touching reverence . It might interest you to meet him , Nat . " " So that I may then re-enact the very sensible and enjoyable egotism of the Pharisee in gloating , Thank God I am not as these tourists ' ? "  | " Why not ? By the way , Lundsgard sounded me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . I turned it down . " " What , " wondered Nat , " is a researcher ? " " You are . " " Young gentleman , I am a frowsty old bachelor . I am also a lie-abed and a secret drinker . I know what research is : somethingunpleasant that men in white jackets , like barbers , do to dogs in dungeon laboratories . But I do n't know what a researcheris . " " He goes out and does the marketing . " " You say that this Dr. Lundsgard , " fretted Nat , " would like a researcher in medieval folkways ? " " Yes . Bring him in two facts and he 'll cook them into a whole lecture . " " Do you suppose he could use me , Hayden ? " " Could a village bank use ' J. Pierpont Morgan ? Could a popularpreacher use ' an archangel ? " " The answer is not necessarily yes ' in either case . Their methods might be different . But the fact is . . . " Nat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may be the last dinner I shall ever give . My cable has finally come , refusing reprieve : the company to which I so cannilyswitched all my funds , not long ago , has failed . My income is finished . I need a job . This is the first time I have ever said , I need a job : " Mrs. Baker cried out and she , the fragile and prudent , ran to Nat and shamelessly sat on his knee , her head against his shoulder . " I have been too cowardly to tell Ada till I should be fortifiedp178by the presence of you strong barbarians . Yes , with considerable ingenuity , I have managed to lose every cent I had . " Mrs. Baker said harshly , " Nonsense ! You have all that I have . " " But you have n't anything , my beloved ; just enough to exist on . It does n't matter . For some time I have been preparing for this . I have n't paid my rent for six months , and my poor servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two days , and this past week she has been bringing me in vegetables from her brother , who is a market-gardener and a reader of Petrarch . He is really our host , this evening , but this is the last time I shall imposeon him . By the way , he speaks with an interesting Livornese accent with a word , now and then , that I can not spot except as a Greek survival . . . . Oh , Ada , Ada , do n't , my dear ! " Mrs. Baker was sobbing , close against him , all her pride and frail austerity gone . " It 's not so bad , Ada . It 's a new adventure . I shall now work according to other people 's notions of what my usefulness may be , instead of my own . If there is anything here , or even back in the States , that I can do that is not too honest or too cultural , I shall do it gladly . Meantime , Hayden , do you think this Dr. Lundsgard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctual and tidy  --  well , reasonably . And at my age , I shall come very cheap . " Hayden telephoned to Lundsgard that there was a chance he might be able to get the renowned Professor Friar to give him some " material , " and of course Dr. Friar was one of only eleven men living who knew European History minute by minute , acre by acre , from 400 A.D. to i800 . Lundsgard was excited . " I have some of Dr. Friar 's articles cut out . You honestly think he might brief me ? How would Ip179get to meet him ? Should I go and call on him at his home ? Would you be willing to take me there ? " Hayden reflected that the shabbiness of Nat 's living room would cut a hundred dollars a week off his market value , and he said hastily , " No , I think that as you would be his superior officer , it would be protocol for him to call on you . " " I do n't insist on form , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form  --  well , you know how it is . Good form is one of the things that I intend to take back to the States , along with philosophy ; I mean the super-high-tone good form , like Ugo 's . So maybe . . . But ask the Prof to pick his own hour to come here . Does he ever sneak in a drink ? " " If you had some very dry sherry for him , I think he might take a sip . " " I 'll have some so dry he 'll think it 's from Kansas . " Nat Friar put on his one good gray suit , he washed and combed his beard , he had a hefty glass of cognac at home , he looked Olympian and felt even better . But in Lundsgard 's suite he spoke with mild delicacy and only touched the glass of offertorysherry . Hayden fretted to himself , " Nat and I are selling the most honest goods on the market , and yet we 're somehow being fakes . I do n't like selling one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . " Encouraged by Lundsgard , Nat started on long tales of the old Italy : Amadeo the Green Count ; Pope Anacletus II , who was of the great Jewish family of the Pierleoni ; that poet and gallant , Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini , who was to become Pope Pius II , to build the mountain village of Pienza as his monu/merit and to lead a crusade ; the Wolf of Gubbio , a beast wolf not a human one , who was converted and became a practising Christian ; Clarice Strozzi , who cursed the tyrants out of the Medici Palace . The stories were as full of gaiety as they were of erudition , and Lundsgard was in ecstasy . He humbly addressed Nat as " sir , " and he kept ejaculating over the chronicles , " Why , that 's corking , sir , that 's superb , that 's just what I need ! " Hayden wondered why Lundsgard did not take notes , till he discovered that the door to the office was part open and that in there Evelyn Hoxler was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I know of course , sir , that if you cared to give me your invaluable aid for a month or so , I could n't even begin to pay you what such priceless learning is worth . But would a hundred and fifty dollars a week somewhat compensateyou ? " Hayden was certain that Nat would not know whether that was fabulously large or pitifully small , and he stepped in with , " Why Lundsgard , you ought certainly to pay him at least two hundred a week ! " Lundsgard 's glance was very sharp , somewhat resentful , and he said curtly , " We 'll make it one-seventy-five . " " That sounds very nice , " beamed Nat . With no further " sirs , " Lundsgard ordered , " Professor , you start in here next Monday morning , nine o'clock . " " Nine ? Nine in the morning ? Very well , " said Nat disconsolately . All day long  --  that is , from nine-thirty or ten or eleven , whenp181he arrived , and leaving out the hour that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a drink  --  in an old velvet jacket and an antique straw gardening hat with which he shaded his eyes , Nat sat happily dictating anecdotes out of the most unhackneyed ( though reasonably accurate ) history . He thought the dictation machine was the most patient ear he had ever found . He sat with the mouthpiece tucked into his beard , smiling at the machine and making explanatory gestures in its direction , telling it about kings and cardinals as though it was likely already to have heard a great deal about them . Nat paid no attention at all to Lundsgard 's visitors , such as smoothers who came in to sell Lundsgard original Botticellis for twentyfivedollars . Translated into lire , which just now were about six hundred to the dollar , Nat 's hundred and seventy-five dollars a week seemed to him like Babylonian wealth . He paid his debts to his servant and her brother , he gave a little something to his landlord , and he bought for himself a fine purple corduroy smokingjacketwith pockets large enough to carry books . For Hayden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a silver tea-caddy . Lundsgard never criticized Nat for unpunctuality . He just read page on page of medieval oddities transcribed by Evelyn Hoxler from Nat 's recorded prattle , and chuckled , " My dear Professor Friar , you come awful dear , but you sure are a treas-ure ! " " Dr. Lundsgard is a very kind man , " said Nat to Hayden . " I suppose he is . " " I just wonder why he took up the crabbed calling of being ap182medievalist . He would have been so useful as a singing cowboy  --  if he can sing . " " If he can punch cattle . " " Exactly . But always very kind . " " Oh , yes  --  yes , certainly  --  very kind . "  |p183N  THE late afternoon , after office hours , Hayden went to see Lundsgard . He thought he heard " Avanti , " when he tapped at the outer door of the suite ; he opened , and stood aghast . Beyondthe living room , in the office , Lundsgard could be heard talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bellyaching . Go on ! Bawl ! I like to hear it , Eve . It makes you even homelier than when you put on the white enamel and look like a madam . Lissen . You got no kick coming at all . You knew what would happen just as well as I did . In fact , you planned it . You hoped to get a wad of  --  well , call it severance money out of me . " " Lorry , I did n't ! I wanted to help Arturo . You made me feel that anything I did for you , when you were so friendly with him , was really for him . " " The loving Mrs. Baccio ! The innocent Miss Hoxler ! Just a country babel Say , I 'd hate to write to the registrar in whatever hayseed county you really come from and ask him your real birth date ! " " Do n't . Please , Lorry ! I wo n't be angry any more . "  | " You 're damn right you wo n't . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'll be around here at all , much longer . " Hayden hastened away , down the hotel corridor , more sick than furious . There are maggots too vile to touch . And for tomorrowthere was to have been a giddy lunch with Lundsgard and Olivia . At the Tre Corone he found her , very cheerful , and he cried , " Sweet , I want to call off tomorrow 's lunch with Lundsgard . " " Why ? " Her disappointment was clear . " He is n't as decent a fellow as you thought . I 've just heard him talking to Eve Hoxler , viciously . " " I 'm glad to hear it . At last ! . That woman has been trying to nab him . She takes advantage of his good nature and his quite charming reverence for women . " " Rev  --  Oh , good God ! " " Do n't you ever have any argument but Good God ' ? Aside from the blasphemy , it 's a little undetailed . " " All right . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get him to show just how much reverence he really has for your frail , cast-iron sex ! " At their lunch , at Paoli 's , with what he felt to be silken cunning , not looking at Olivia but being as cunning as a dove and as innocent as a serpent , he challenged Lundsgard : " You 're always saying that women inspire you , and yet I wonder what you really think about the ones like Olivia , who are so independent ? " He wondered if the fault could have been Evelyn Hoxier 's , when he saw how grave and mature Lundsgard became : " You wo n't like my sure-enough attitude , Hay , and Livy won't. "  | . ' Oh ? " said Hayden , and Olivia said , " Oh ! " " I 'll have to give you my whole philosophy , and I 'm not very articulate , you might say . As I see it , the world has been going through what you might call a multiple revolution , and the uppitygirl who thinks her whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these smeary modern painters belong right together  --  all anarchists . But I figuretheir seven-story revolution is over , all but the shouting . The whole world wants authority and , you might call it , tradition . New world coming ! " It 'll first of all want heroes and not a gang of statisticians and wisecracking critics . Unluckily for me , I 'm not big enough , or I 'm too early , to be one of the star magnificoes , but I can help clear the way for them  --  yes , and you just watch ' em ride in on a golden highway , with flags and trumpets ! " These guys that 'll be the leaders , they 'll have to have power and responsibility . They 'll want their orders obeyed on the jump , though they 'll be darned generous to their mob in return . They may not wear any ten-ton armor , but they 'll make my ancestorLorry the Magnificent , Serial One , look like a ribbonclerk . They 'll use chemistry and jet planes and atomic power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough , and I guess they 'll be willing to get killed for it  --  and to kill ! " To all this souvenir-post-card Nietzsche , this 1905 preHitlerism , Olivia was listening , with no hostility but with fond amusement at her Lorry 's enthusiasm . Encouraged by her if not by Hayden , he boomed on : " But all these high duties for the men leaders mean there 's got to be even higher duties for the women . A guy ca n't lead anp186army and still stay at home and teach the Little Woman golf . Nowadays the career woman , who was the big news even five years ago , is as old-fashioned as a buggy whip . Now she 's got a better goal : to be loyal to men that got to be big enough to be loyal to ; to give herself in a real blazing devotion to helping carry on her man 's battle for supremacy ; to lead the Leader . Ca n't you see it , Livy ? She wo n't get a professor 's chair or a slick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll share a throne  --  and believe me , there 's going to be thrones to share ! You bet ! To be queen in her home is n't old-fashioned but the most ultramodern , up-to-the-split-second , re-revolutionary ideal there is ! " So go ahead and shoot me , both of you . Hay , you can report me to all your revolutionary little friends for wanting to march all the poor farmboys ( like you and me both ! ) right back to their peasant huts , unless they can get the Vision of Leadership and obey it . Okay ! I 'm ready ! " Afterward , Hayden avoided discussing with Olivia this scarlet-and-pea-green vision of Lundsgard , the view of the noblestman as the mining-camp bully . If she had been unhappy about it , he wanted to spare her ; if she had liked it , he wanted to spare himself . And that same afternoon , Evelyn Hoxler , who had never talked to Hayden by himself , telephoned asking him , and anxiously , to meet her at Gilli 's for a drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening about Miss Hoxler . He had the impression of a rattlesnake in ambush , and indeed there was a good deal of hiss in all her S 's , as she rapidly drank down Italian cognacs : " Lundsgard is sending me sobbing back to Rome , and I askedp187to see you , Mr. Chart , so I could try and do the stinker a little harm before I go skipping back to commit suicide . " She did not strike Hayden as notably benevolent , and he listened not too willingly to her hatred . " I gave Lorry the best clerical assistance he 'll ever get and you 've probably guessed  --  I never tried to hide it especially  --  I gave him a lot more . He 's a quick worker . When you first meet him , if you can be useful , he 'll love you , but the moment he can get more out of sponging on somebody else 's brains , out you go , without even a handshake . When he gets to be a dictator , he 'll pull off some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a baby . By the way , his first name is n't Lorenzo . His fond mother named her golden-haired Viking rosebud Oley , and in college he changed that to Lawrence , and he put on the Lorenzo , along with a shot at English accent ( when he remembers it ) in Hollywood . " I want to warn you , with the most evil intentions , that while I do n't think he 's had much chance to fool with this conceited young woman of yours , Miss Lomond , he 's certainly licking his chops . " " I think Dr. Lomond can take care of herself ! " " I know I can take care of myself ! That do n't do you much good when the car hits a patch of grease like Lundsgard and skids . " The appositeness of it jarred Hayden and frightened him . " Mr. Chart , I have a feeling you plan to get out of this combinationcocktail party and mental sanitarium they call the AmericanColony and go home . Home ! Beat it , fast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . No flowers ! "  |p188He  met Angelo Gazza , Lundsgard 's photographer , on the street , and invited him to coffee . He blurted , " What sort of a chap is this Lundsgard , really ? " " Oh , Lorenzaccio is all right . He 's a pusher . Pays pretty good but gets his money 's worth and then some . . . . Say , you 're fond of Dr. Lomond , are n't you ? " " Very . Why ? " " Oh , she comes in to see Professor Friar and maybe Lundsgardnow and then and . . . She 's trained too good , for our shop . She wants us to get our facts  --  we do an import and exportbusiness in historical facts  --  she wants ' em catalogued like a history book , but Lundsgard tells her , Never mind the efficiencystuff . This is n't a factory ; this is a solar center for radiatinginspiration . ' Dr. Lomond is very well informed  --  for an American . " " You do n't like us Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell of it . I love you . Best chum I ever had was a master-sergeant from Brooklyn , half-Wop and half-Mick . I 'd like to live in America . That 's why I keep panning you  --  to keep safe from you hundred-and-eighty pound babies ! Why are so many Americans immature ? Why do n't you grow up ? Half of you pulling polysyllables , when I do n't know ' would do , and the other half  --  medical majors and chaplains and flying colonels  --  talkinglike high-school boys , Oh , Boy ! ' and Watch my smoke ' and not enthusiastic about anything except baseball and women . " And the American woman is the only one I know of whose heart and brain stay cold and indifferent to you while all the rest of her body pretends to catch fire . An Italian or French woman either loves you or she does n't , but the American lady  --  she kissesp189you hot at eight-thirty and looks at you cold at eleven  --  or anywayat eight-thirty next morning . And yet I do admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Memorable Ruins in Italy . " That 's what has turned so many of us into guides and postcardsellers . We could build the best ships and automobiles and electrical equipment in the world , but our medieval gateways and palazzi municipals gum up our city planning . " I 'd like to blow up every building in Italy older than 189o . All you tourists shrieking that it 's so cute of us to have threefootalleys for thoroughfares and yelling your heads off when we put in broad boulevards like you all do at home . Oh , it 's probably real quaint in me to be descended from some Etruscangangster . . . . And I 'll watch Dr. Lomond for you like a sister-in-law . " " You think she needs it ? " " Lundsgard is one of these Leaders , and all Leaders think that all the votes and the applause and the money and the women belong to them . . . . Good luck ! Ciao ! " Olivia was absent-minded at dinner and it was only after a quarter-hour of mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fire that Hoxler woman . " " Yes . " " In fact he has . " " I see .

"  |p191WH  E N the wildfire news ran round the hills that Signoreit Professor Friar was paying his debts , he was assaulted by bills a year old , five years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not owe . In particular , his landlord , long a tolerant friend , once he saw the sheen of ten-thousandlirenotes wanted to be paid to date , and his former intimates , the book-sellers , threatened to cart off his library , beloved and a quarter unpaid-for . Nat refused to take even a loan from Mrs. Baker , who was little more affluent than himself . He became grim . Now that he had started , he would be businesslike . He said to Hayden , " I would prefer , of course , to desert Lundsgard , now that the adventure is rusty . I have no complaint about him ; he treats me well . He is the only man living who thinks my information about Gubbio and Spoleto is worth listening to , and that , to me , is grateful . Like many people weary with knowledge , I have perhaps unduly esteemed the fresher wisdoms of younger people , but this mental passion has rarely been reciprocated  --  perhapsonly by you and Olivia and Lundsgard . Butp192I have some difficulty in liking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not sure but that Dr. Lundsgard is a very bad man . He is nimble at making historical parallels to prove that the rule of plain unlettered men has always been disastrous , to prove that we need louder-voiced millionaires to guide us . But to prove it , he adulterates all the facts that I go down into the coal pit and shovel up to him . " I 'm not sure but that it 's what you call a racket , I 'm not sure but that he is in the soundest tradition of treason  --  treason to love , to friendship , to patriotism , to religion , for the most sensitive blessings are also the most interesting to betray . In his case , he is making a cheerful activity of treason to learning , like the journalistswho trap invalids by praising fraudulent medical discoveries . " He is even developing prophetic illusions : that all history has been moving toward a moral goal according to a discernible scheme , and that he is the only man who can discern it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might use with him , but otherwise , what am I to do ? Place your charming girl , Olivia , under my arm and take to the Abruzzi caves to escape my remaining creditors ? " I can see now where all my quandary started : paying my servant , who is a true Italian peasant and never expected such an insult from an illustrissimo ! " But Nat did nothing . And Hayden did nothing , and suddenly he was sick of Lundsgard and Florence and Europe . It can happenso with exiles . One moment he loved Italy ; the next , its ways seemed antiquated and a little silly . He could not even hear thep193language clearly . It was all an unaccented gabble . When he walked in the evening , a group of sharp young loafers in front of a movie theater  --  as dangerous as a like group in Concord , Massachusetts  --  seemed to be his enemies , whispering , " Let 's stab that foreigner or chase him out of the country ! " That week , letters from home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not seen for ten years , letters which had recently bored him by their weather reports and the gossip about people whom he did not remember , were suddenly precious salvation . When he had first come to Florence he had gratefully used the hospitality of the governmental AmericanLibrary in the Palazzo Strozzi and read the American magazines , the newspapers . He had later become almost indifferent to their bulletins of a land so far off , but now he hastened back to them , and they promised him the refuge of home . That promised refuge he needed the more because daily he less liked the relationship between Lundsgard and Olivia . Rich now in what he considered knowledge , in Nat 's anecdotesand Gazza 's photographs , strong in the approval of Sir Henry Belfont and the toleration of Sam Dodsworth , Mr. Lundsgardstill considered Hayden a decent fellow , but he no longer considered his counsel of any merit , and when Hayden had an idea , Lundsgard 's attitude was " Yes , yes . " He preferred to see Hayden only in bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolf 's den to find out how much of his lamb had been devoured now . He warned himself that Lundsgard 's office was a busy place , that he had no more right to intrude there than to stroll into anp194operating-room and suggest having a cigarette with a performingsurgeon . They were not snubbing him  --  no , they were just busy . But all he knew was that he got snubbed . Nat beamed at him , but even the friendly Gazza seemed annoyed , Lundsgard looked impatient , and Olivia , busy with lists of Umbrian painters , snapped , " Oh , must you leave that door open , Hayden dear ? " How patronizing and unlovely was her " Hayden dear " compared with her tender " Dear Hayden " ! But he bullied Lundsgard and her into coming out to tea with him . They were in the Piazza della Republica , outside of Donnini'sat a small table among Italian families prosperous and voluble . The researchers did not look at Hayden . Olivia was competentlyanswering Lundsgard 's equally competent questions about the wool-carders guild in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening to his betters . And when the interrogation was over  --  he could imagine it , gilded and magnifiedand made to sound learned and important , bestowed on a respectful lecture audience in a municipal arena dedicated to wrestling , political conventions , roller skating and Shakespeare  --  the two of them apparently believed that they were alone in the Forest of Arden , no melancholy Mr. Chart within ten leagues . They creaked happily in their wicker chairs as they teased each other  --  about punctuality ! One would not have chosen that topic as a beguiling link between illicit lovers , and yet Lundsgard and the girl were lyric as he cloyingly bickered , " And you were ten minutes late  --  you were , you were , " and the female conspirator murmured , " Oh , pooh , I  --  was  --  not ! " It seemed to Hayden that an appalling softness had comep195over her in her manner toward Lundsgard . When that bounding animal touched her bare elbow , which he did oftener than was quite necessary for emphasis , she , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had for him a smile which went beyond the pleased obedience which custom expects from a female officehand . Lundsgard was startled to discover some one much like HaydenChart still with them , and he went out of his way to get in , " You certainly have a grand effect on your girl friend here , Hay . When you are n't around , she treats me like dirt , but when you 're here , she tries to make you jealous by treating me fairly good . I wish I had your neat touch with the women ! " And looked , then , at Olivia in a proprietarial pride which was more betraying than any yelp of passion . No . Hayden was coldly certain that this pair of profit-hunting pedants , of ranging sensationalists , were lovers now , beyond charity . Then they deserved each other ! But the stubbornness that had always marched with him , most relentless when it was most quiet , the stubbornness that had fortifiedhim to endure Caprice 's clownish demands and Jesse Bradbin'switless jesting , rose in Hayden now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one else could do it  --  certainly not the moist-eyed young woman herself , now yearning toward Lundsgard 's ten-bushel of manly beauty . And , reflected Hayden , he himself had guiltily broken through her poor wall of defense . She was " worth saving "  --  thistrained and honest woman , even now when she was demonstrating that she was not in all things so edifyingly honest . He would save her  --  if . He had nothing of more importancep196to do , now . . . . And , with a fascination apparently undiminishedby her idiocy , he happened to love her . Lundsgard was giving himself , and apparently he felt that he was giving them , considerable gratification in letting them know that he now moved on a charming social plane , jammed with Gracious Living . Prince Ugo Tramontana had invited him to come for tea and see some Second Century Roman cameos . ... He referred to the learned relic as Ugo , and before he rose he lighted a tremendous American cigar , with the Lorenzan band still on it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone , Olivia said briskly , " Well , have to start home and wash my face . " " Sit down again , Olivia . I want to do some scolding . I want you to quit your job with Lundsgard .... " " I should n't think of it . " " ... and at once . You can call him up this evening . " " Ri-dic-ulous ! " She sat down firmly . " And tell him to hurry up and find that new stenographer  --  whom he had no intention of finding . " " Why , I 've never heard . . . " " And then , without any tapering off or artful use of drugs , I want you to kick that fellow out , complete . " " Ab-surd ! " " I do n't know precisely where you stand with Lundsgard now , but I do know it 's just a matter of whether you will or whether you have . What ? " She jumped at the unexampled force and roughness of his " What ? " He jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you two lovers now ? " She quieted down . She looked at him without fear . " Well , we could be , and that 's all I shall tell you . " " It 's enough . Do you want to get rid of me ? " " No , really , Hay  --  Hayden , I do n't . I am enormously fond of you . It 's so happy and easy to be with you , and I admire your decencyand calm . I would like to hold you , always  --  no , I intend to hold you ! And I agree with you that Lorry is a misguided and misguiding truck-driver  --  in fact , I know it much better than you do ! But he is also a knight , a blithe and unconquerable knight . After all , Giovanni delle Bande Nere was n't distinguishedfor his accurate knowledge of dates or his fidelity to the sweet girl at home . Lorry is a fake  --  good Heavens , do n't you suppose I 'm well trained enough to know that ! But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could either you or I do to head him off ? " " You really are satisfied to let yourself be tied and hogtied by this gorilla ? " " You still do get very American , do n't you , dear ! " " I hope so ! Answer me ! You 're satisfied ? " " Maybe not . But what can I do ? " " Do you happen to know that your golden Lorenzo 's real first name is Oley ? " " Is it ? That 's good . It sounds strong and honest and yet not puritanical ; positively debonair . I was afraid  --  of course I was reasonably sure that he was n't a geborener Lorenzo  --  I thought probably he was a Hiram or a Jabez . " " Olivia , I do n't think this hour calls for humor . You must have some notion of how serious it is for me . Leave out jealousy andp198hurt pride : I can choke those , but you can guess what it means to me to see a well-bred woman in the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That is my battle , or as Lorry and you would say , That 's my lookout ' ! " Olivia was so defiant that she did not even trouble herself to stress it greatly . " Yes . It is n't easy . I could n't slug that football hero  --  I would get killed . There 's no use my exposing him as a charlatan  --  everybody with any scholarship guesses that already . But still , I certainly do not intend to be the complaisant husband . I demandas strict a fidelity of you as I do of myself . And I ca n't do the most natural and convenient thing of all : tell you that I am disgusted , that I am not standing any more , that I am through ; because I am still almost completely hypnotized by you  --  just almost , mind you ! I do n't know what to do . " Softly , but with the slippery softness of a false woman , she urged , " Oh , forget it , my dear . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not last  --  no , merely in the heart and brain and devoted faith , that 's all ! Frankly , Olivia , I am trying to coach myself to feel easy in cutting you out as I would any other vice that hurt me too much , and I ca n't  --  not yet ! " With flippant impatience , she piped , " Have you finished now with your fussing and clucking and general sad bewilderment over something that ought to be obvious  --  that , as I keep telling you but you wo n't listen , a flirtation like this just ca n't last ? Or matter ! " " I 've given you my warning . " " And I my warning that you will be extremely sorry , not for any crime I am committing but for your own subhuman , dry-as/dust , school-principal nagging  --  with no heart in it and no humor . Oh , Hayden , you admire our medieval gallants so much , you say , and then the minute anything touches you , you flee from them back to your dry-codfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outraged and innocent wrath that is nowhere so splendidly found as among the guilty . " I have never lied to you or about you . Well , I am going now , and you may do exactly whatever you please ! Arrivederci ! " She flounced away and , without explanations , she did not come to dinner that evening at the pensione . So he cut and ran.  |p200E  CUT and ran . It was absurd not to have seen Rome ; it was intolerable to sit and twiddle his fingers and watch Olivia chase the dragon and be only very annoyed by a St. George . He drove to Rome through the pleasant hills and , as always , fell in love with Siena almost as with Florence : the square , the cathedral , the Palazzo Chigi . But Rome he found too buxom , too busy , too operatically regal for love , and only fit for wonder , from the Vatican 's sanctuary to the Palatine Hill where he walked through 100 B.C.He did perceive how grandly Rome was marching back to her ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch of the emperors he saw the jeeps parked between the Rolls-Royces and Cadillacs ; the traffic was more alarming than Michigan Avenue ; overhead were the airplanes which rarely teased demure Florence ; and in new and haughty cement buildings breathlessly telephoning were California oilmen , Persian oilmen , British airplaneagents , Hungarian cinema producers , French television engineers , Egyptian steamship agents , quiet Russians who lovedp201an evening alone with their pipes and books and one small atomic bomb , Brazilian vendors of coffee and jazz symphonies , and Croat spies spying on Bulgar spies spying on Turkish spies spying on Rome . Not even the massive haughtiness of the antique temples and the imperial baths more lightened Hayden 's technical eye than the urbanity of avenues like Via Veneto . Yet he was not annoyed that in Rome , with all the Holy Year pilgrims , he had been unable to find a satisfactory hotel room , and had gone with his topolino out to a village inn . After supper there he sat on a bench in an arbor and looked at the green evening sky of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and terrible Olivia . He returned to Florence and the Tre Corone late in the afternoon and Olivia was there and unexpectedly welcoming . She tightened her arms round him , she muttered , " So much , missed you so much . " He shakily tried to be carefree in a cheerful , " Let 's go out and have dinner this evening . " " Oh , darling , I am so , so sorry , but I have an invitation to dinner  --  did n't know when you were coming hack  --  might have sent a girl a post card . " He did not ask , she ( lid not say , from whom was her invitation . " I 'll make it up to you later ! " she chirruped , with needless sweetness . He dined alone , except for the table-to-table yells of the newestgeneration of boarding-house pests , who were not , this time , large like the Grenadier Sisters and were not females and were not American , but three diminutive and aged males from Lux/embourg . But it was all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelping " Haf you seen the Cenacolo in the convent of Sant ' Onofrio ? No ? " and " Haf you seen the tomb of Oddo Altoviti by Rovezzano ? No ? " Olivia returned very late , still with no information volunteeredabout her evening entertainment , and she was not so affectionate in saying good-night to him as she had promised ; she was mechanical about it and slightly annoyed ; and he went to sleep in a trance of emptiness and futility . Hayden had been going to one Dr. Stretti to keep watch on the headaches he still had , now and then , from his motor smash , and had become admiring and fond of that round , dumpy , very learned and skillful physician with his mouse of a mustache . He was not only Hayden 's friend and his doctor but , Italian-wise , his doctor because he was a subtle and understanding friend . On the morning after his return from Rome , Hayden 's head was one round pain held together by his skull , and he hastened to Stretti , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the road from Rome . He bathed Hayden 's eyes and laughed at his tension and generally did medical magic on him . Said Dr. Stretti , " My brother , who is also an architect , in Turin , and who is very curious about American methods , will be in Florence just for today . Could you come to a very plain supper at my flat this evening and meet him ? " Hayden had made no definite plan with Olivia for dinner this coming evening , and indignantly , with the injustice typical of all particularly fond lovers , he thought , " I 'll teach that young woman a lesson  --  leaving me flat last evening , my first evening back in Florence , " and he said to the doctor heartily , " Shall be very happy to . "  |p203Dr  . Stretti 's apartment was in one of the long , newish , solemn , residence streets out near the Cascine ; on a fourth floor reached by a particularly adventurous self-service elevator in which you felt , when you pressed the button for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly . But the apartment itself was like that of any well-to-do doctor in Newlife or in New York , except that there were rather more upholstered chairs around small tables in the living room , and more poison-green upholstered armchairs with doilies , and books in three languages , and far more paintings by contemporaries . The architect-brother , whose English was as struggling as Hayden 's Italian , gave him a small homesickness by confessing exactly such struggles with clients and contractors and unions and politicians as Hayden knew at home : the same newly rich who wanted marble bathrooms for the price of tile , and tile bathroomsfor the price of linoleum . He glowed at Hayden and took him in . So did the doctor ; so did Mrs. Stretti , though she spoke no English at all . But she assured Hayden , with more kindness than strict factualness , that he was now speakingItalian like a pfofessore . The whole family took him in . In their cordiality and ease with a stranger , they seemed to him more like Americans than any nationals he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , as after dinner he drank small glasses of vino santo and agreed with them that , yes , they would indeed like I lollywood and the Grand Canyon . But of them all , one had more importance than just well-manneredamiability , and that was the daughter , Tosca Stretti , a girl of twenty who was all eyes and shine of dark hair and slimness and youth and trustfulness . She was constantly turning to herp204uncle , her parents , with affection and admiration ; she loved life and loved her family . And , without having any English , she could say to Hayden that she looked upon him as a man and a remarkable one . An aggressive American woman would have jeered of Tosca , " Sure , you men like ' em submissive , like ' em as slaves . This little Italian would clean your shoes and you 'd love it ! " Yes , Tosca probably would clean them , if there should be need , but devotedly , with dignity , not submissively . Without discussion she would expect to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hayden did not think of his colleague , the architect , but of Tosca . It would be fun to be with her , to teach her English , to show her his America . Why had n't he such a girl , soft and trusting and yet as sharply capable as her mother , and not an inspiring heartache like Olivia ? Why not ? By coaxing Tosca to come home with him , he would have in the stability of home that strangeness and flavor which lie had needed in Newlife . All next day he thought of Tosco and the thought was to him a soft comfort which he needed after reading a note which Olivia had left for him when she went off , early , to the Laurentian Library  --  or to Lundsgard 's boudoir office : I had assumed we would be having dinner together last evening but you skipped off with no explanations . That is too bad becausethis evening I have a date &; shall not see you. 0 . L.His inward comment had all of lovers ' logic . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stand for being stood up butp205she  --  oh yes , she is to desert me whenever she feels like it but I 'm to stand by all the time . But naturally she was miffed  --  you ca n't blame her . " Olivia and he had , without any special agreement , built up a habit of festival evening together each Saturday , with restaurant dinner and a movie or a concert , but on this warm , resonant Saturday evening in the Italian late spring , he dined drearily , alone , at the " ire Conine , cheered only by the thought of how trustingly Tosca Stretti had smiled at him . He was at his coffee when Perpetua came to inform him that a " Signorina Altici " was there to see him , waiting in the salotto . Tosca ? Why ? He went hurriedly and on a couch , her hat put aside , in a fawn suit that seemed much worn and leather sandals that certainlywere worn , tired , defiant , appealing , forlorn , familiar , stranger than any Calabria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roxanna Eldritch of Newlife , Colorado . But mostly , she was very quiet . She had sprung up to greet him ; he had galloped forward and kissed her . She was a chunk of Home miraculously set down before him : the cheerful , overcrowded streets ; cottonwoods and willows by the river bank ; swiftly grown skyscrapers ; the office and the club where he was not a bookish nonentity studying in an alien and indifferent land , but a man , a boss , a friend , a citizen , a person of heart and welcome , and in it all a jolliness that could never warm an Olivia in her delicate savor of life  --  nor even a Tosca conceivably so dear . And this home soil was his own , without explanations or working at it . In a jungle he hadp206seen , startling , his own familiar flag , and Roxy and he yelled at each other with fond tribal cries . The more he looked at her , the more she seemed changed . She was as fetching as ever but she looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dejection in her shoulders . And , " Might as well get it over , " said Roxy . " I 've plumb flopped . Been fired . " " How come ? " " Oh , partly loafing and dissipation , I guess , though I did a lot of work , too . But it has slowly been borne in on me that the bright kid from the home town , who thinks it would just be too cute if she could be the big noise as an authority on Europe and tell the home folks all about the hobbies of the dethroned kings and interview a few prime ministers , and throw in a few explanations of the devaluation of the pound  --  she is n't so hot when she gets into competition with the veterans that have been here , off and on , twenty years and speak five languages and actuallyreal a book once . " Funny but they simply wo n't see the light and obligingly hand over their prestige to me and go to work in the jute factory  --  along with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home oceans of copy and first my managing editor used a lot and even got a few pieces syndicated , but I guess the novelty went bump , and little while ago , he tactfully wrote canning me , with a warm-hearted suggestion  --  the old sweetheart  --  that I might get my old job back if I hustled to Newlife , but quick ! " But now I 'm here , I want to see more of Europe , maybe Greece and Spain , and then Israel and Egypt . And I am going to work  --  work like a worker and not like a Bohemian amateurp207lady journalist who gets busy only when the bars are closed and the handsome young vice-consul wo n't answer his phone . " Honestly ! Getting bounced was an awful shock to me . I guess most American women , even some of those that have been quite a long time on a real job , still think that their sacred womanhoodentitles them to ( In anything they want to , arrive late and loaf on the job they 're paid for , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up at anybody 's mother 's knee . Shock ? I 'll say ! It made me think , ' Rox , my man , maybe that managing editor wants to print written writings and not your charming intentions and your sorrel hair ! ' " And I guess , even before the assassination , I 'd had about enough of the bar-to-bar girlish lady tourists of fifty , the students of singing who never sing anything but ' Just pickle my bones in alcohol , ' and all the artistic young men from Wyoming and the Bronnix that wear nasty little beards as sandwich boards to advertise their otherwise imperceptible talents , beards like young alley goats and flannel shirts like zoot-suiters . " While I 'm over here , if it 's not too inconvenient , I would still like to meet one French Frenchman and one Italian Italian . You know  --  quaint but almost as interesting as the sixteenth young American this month to found a Little Magazine dedicated to freedom , the new arts and gin .

But I do n't intend to sponge on you in any way , Hay , get that clear , money or time or anything . I just want your assurance that I 'm still potentially human , even if I am a flop ! " . He cried , " How human ! Now , right away , I 'll take you out for a dinner that would make Reverend Gowelly  --  remember the Prohibition raider , back home ?  --  throw up his dusty hat and kiss the bartender . " " Thanks  --  some night  --  tomorrow if you 'd like  --  but I 've had a rick of spaghetti already tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Roxy  --  maybe here in this refined junction depot . " " Thanks , I 've already found a room in a dump across the river . I asked a tourist agency . Iron cot and a kitchen chair and a nice calico curtain for wardrobe ; 327 yards from the bathroom . Honestly , I wo n't bother you .... " " You could n't , my dear ! " " Oh , could n't I ! Give me credit ! No , all I want is some advice about getting a job here , for a girl that speaks no known language . . . . If Hayden was , a moment , inattentive , it was because he knew that Olivia might come in and find him affectionately seated on the couch beside the not inconspicuous charms of Roxy . Would it not be discreet to explain Roxy before Olivia should see her  --  to take her out , now , to the security of a cafe ? But he turned defiant ; he rebuked himself for his sour timidity . Roxy was beyond debate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ashamed  --  not like Olivia and her bounding Lorry . " Let 's see , Roxy . There 's a Mrs. Dodsworth here , importantp209in the Colony , and I remember her saying something about being a trustee of an American school for girls that 's just being organized . I 'll phone her this evening . And now  --  more of you , my dear ! Have you lost your heart to any of your young geniuses with the tarred-and-feathered chins ? " " No , not much . A young female wandering around Europe alone learns to he pretty glacial when she gets picked up . " " That happen often ? " " Continuously ! Drench drugstore cowboys . tad Norwegian artists and Swiss professors and American G. I .. ' s and American lieutenant colonels . You do get tired of their ' How about it ? ' smirk .

" " Why do n't you go home , Roxy ? " " Why should I ? " " It seems natural to be home , where you understand people by instinct , understand why they do the particular things they do do and do say  --  dumb or dreary or noble and silly . " " Then why do n't you go , Hay ? " " Oh , I 've really settled down contentedly to study . And , uh , I have a girl I 'm somewhat interested in ... " " Oh ! " " Two , in fact : a splendid American scholar , and an adorable Italian girl . " " Two ? Then it 's all right . " " I want you to . . .

" He was stroking her hand , feeling slightly more than avuncular , when a menace trembled in the air and made him look up . Olivia was just inside the room , watching them , and as Haydensaw her Borgia eyes , they said , almost audibly , " Ah , I see ! And you the species of camel who has been demanding that I give up my innocent colleague , Professor Lundsgard ! " He did have sense enough not to throw Roxy 's hand at Olivia and jump up guiltily ; he did have the genius to go on holding that hand comfortably and to purr , " So glad you came , Olivia . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much about  --  great friend of Caprice , and I 've known her , bless her dear neighborly heart , since she was a baby . " Before Roxy could even get started , Olivia fired : " That does make quite a long , long period of knowing Miss Uh , does n't it ! " But there proved , then , to be nothing wrong with Roxy 's artillery.  |p212H  E Y were both rare , thought Hayden : Olivia , crystal framed in ivory and silver ; Roxanna , rose-crystal rimmed with burnished copper . If they could be friends ! He blundered  --  but perhaps no cardinal secretary of state could have been altogether diplomatic in this crisis : " I hope you two charmers are going to be close friends . You 're certainly the best friends I have ! " Olivia said to him sweetly , " Are we also to be close friends with your dear Tosca Stretti ? " " Now what the devil do you know about Tosca ? A delightful girl but how ... " " You forget Florence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Stretti today about a lame wrist  --  he strained it years ago in a great football battle , and the doctor told him that you and his daughter had hit it off wonderfully  --  I think he is quite hopeful of her having an escorted tour to the wonders of Colorado , some day before long ! Congratulations  --  to you , I mean , not to the poor young lady ! " Just when Hayden was bewildered by this foul attack , Olivia was temporarily reinforced by the enemy , Roxanna , who tittered ,  |p2113  " Who is this little number you 've been keeping up your sleeve , without letting Mother know , I lay ? Doing the young Italian wrecks along with the old Italian ruins , arc you ? " He stated , with just the ludicrous touchy dignity that both Olivia and Roxy had meant to stir up in him , " Miss Stretti is a young girl I met casually at dinner . She does n't even speak English . " " I see ! " said Olivia and " I see ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so , having punished him for introducingthem to each other , the two puritanical and jeeringly righteous ladies turned murderously upon each other . " You 're not staying long in Florence are you , Miss Eldritch ? " Olivia said caressingly . ( " And she pretended first not to remember Roxy 's name ! " ) But Roxy snatched off the first skirmish . She put on , not the damning , insinuating cordiality of Olivia but the more dangerouspose of never posing ; she was as simple and frank as Satan . " I really do n't know how long I 'll be here , Dr. Lomond . Oh , yes , I know your name so well . Hay was telling me what a fine scholar you are , and how you 've helped him , the poor darling , helpless amateur , understand something of Florence . But me , I 'm simply a sketchy newspaper hack , and I reckon I 'll be lucky if I ever as much as learn Florence 's last name . " " Last . . . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be going on to Rome , no doubt . I 'm sure you 'll want to take maybe four or five days in Rome . It 's an extremely important focal point . " " Yes , I think I read that somewhere , " said Roxy , most plain faced and obedient . " You feel so , too ? Then I 'll have to take a quick look at the place , I guess . " More sweetly than ever , from Olivia : " I suppose you 're stayingp214at the Grand or the Excelsior , here in Florence ? A poor student on a scholarship , like me  --  I confess I do envy you rich journal-ists . " Roxy did n't take it ; she did n't blurt that she was poor and jobless ; she said rustically , " I guess I 'm just a lucky girl . But I do n't know as I 'll stay on at the Excelsior . My private bathroom is pretty fair there  --  black marble and a crocus-yellow tub , but I do n't know  --  they could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all my cosmetic bottles  --  you do get into such a naughty habit of buying cut-glass flasks in Paris , so amusing to amble along the Rue de la Paix and the dear old Champs and pick up exclusive perfumes . Of course , in my profession , having to meet prime ministers and generals and atomic scientists and handsome movie stars so intimately , and really importanthistorians , I have to have a decent place to chat with them . " Olivia was not routed . " Naturally , my dear . Such interesting , important work . And you should n't feel especially inferior with them , or so humble . " " I  --  do n't ! " ( " Are two women who like the same man , or who have oppositepolitical faiths , always bitches to each other when they meet ? Or merely usually ? " ) " Quite right , quite right , Miss Eldritch . Perhaps these dignitariesget something of a fresh , breezy point of view from meeting you . And now , Hayden , I must trot off to my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for my opinion on some secret documents about Charles VIII that have just been discovered . I 'll leave you and Miss Eldritch to enjoy talking aboutp215your neighbors in Newlife . If I do n't see you again , Miss Eldritch , I hope you will have a very enjoyable journey to Rome . Good night ! " " That woman , " said Roxanna , " that woman  --  that woman is  --  she 's a knockout . She knows how to make up that mahogany skin of hers so it looks slick . Even with a crooked nose and too small a mouth and a wrinkly forehead and cars like a rabbit , she manages to look quite beautiful . " " Now you ... " " And without any training except bossing a schoolroom for years and years , she makes like real royalty . The boarding-house queen ! What a lucky boy you are ! When she gets you back home , the Bradbins will take to her like a duck to water . She has their same stunt of making you feel that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you ought to see a doctor . " Hayden was tired of their war ; he had seen only too much of such delightful business in Caprice 's opinion of every pretty woman newly arrived in Newlife . He said , affectionately , " Roxy , I appeal to you as an old friend and neighbor ... " " Yes ? " " To shut up . " " Oh ! " " I 'm extraordinarily fond of you , and always have been , and I hope to give you a good time seeing Florence  --  with the assistanceof Olivia , who knows more about it than sixteen tourists like you and me put together . So when you and she get the posingand prancing and pawing the earth over , we 'll all be happy and almost grown-up . "  | " Okay , Chief ! " " And I 'll introduce you to her friend , and mine , Lorenzo Lundsgard , who 's a scholar and a smart lecturer and a football hero and a Hollywood actor and a big handsome brute and a sophisticated European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves redheads . " " That vision , " stated Roxanna , " you got out of a book . He 's Abelard and Heloise , that 's who he is , and he 's dead . I 've seen his tomb in Pere-Lachaise . " She rose . " I 'll take you home , Roxy . I have a little car . " " No , honestly , sweetie ; I told you ! I 'm not going to sponge on you . I want to walk home and begin to learn this town . All I want is a tip on a job . Will you ask Mrs. What's-her-name about it tomorrow ? " " Dodsworth ? I certainly shall . Roxy , it 's nice to have you here ! Extremely ! " " Thanks , clear . And I 'll quit picking on your Mexican sugar pie. , " Splendid . " " It was too easy ! Good night , Wonderful ! " Olivia came to his room that evening and attacked at once . " Who is this little fly-by-night Eldritch piece , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk in the Five-and-Ten , I imagine  --  in your Colorado wilderness ? " " You know perfectly that she was a friend of my wife and myself , just a little younger , and she is a newspaperman of stand-ing. "  | " Have you been keeping her up your sleeve all the time you 've been in Europe ? " " You know I have n't . " He was grave , unsquabbling . " I have always liked her and honored her . She is gallant and a little touching in her ambition to be something more than a jolly pirate . No , I do not plan to flirt with her . No , I have not done so in the past  --  except in that she is so radiant and well rounded and highly touchable that no normal man could look at her without being a little fatuous and lively . . . . Oh , Olivia , it 's hard enough for us to stay infatuated without asking some outsider to come iii and think up good ways of making us miserable ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I did n't mean her . I meant Lorenzo  --  Lancelot . I do worship you  --  I think . Do n't let 's let anybody come between us ! Let 's quit this childish , You broke that engagement so I 'll break this one and teach you a lesson . ' Both of us ! Let 's be content with love . Let 's not tamper with the gift of God ! " Instantly she rose to her passionate affection of the past , crying , " No ! We must n't ! We 've been so close ! Oh , people always becometraitors to love . It 's so simple and tremendous that their mean little minnows of souls ca n't stand the glory ! " Despite the danger of the practically ubiquitous Mrs. Manse , despite the charms of Roxanna and the manly Mr. Lundsgard and Tosca Strati , they embraced each other with hungry sighing , almost weeping over the perils they had now conquered . Next morning , less shining of wing and slightly irritable when Perpetua was late bringing in his coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be an inspired notionp218to get  --  to try to get  --  Olivia to hand over her job in Lundsgard 's office to Roxanna , together with all her rights , privileges and interests in the said Lundsgard . But that would be a dirty trick to play on Roxy , aside from the fact that Olivia would see them both damned first . So he telephoned to Mrs. Samuel Dodsworth.  |p219MRS  . DODSWORTH was a woman equally kind and efficient . For Roxanna she could find no school post but she did ferret out a position as chauffeur , reader , masseuse , servantfirerand listener to anecdotes about deceased spouse and successfulnephews , to the rich Mrs. Orlando Weepswell , and there Roxanna had a suite and a maid and a slight paralysis of the auditory nerves . Roxy , with Hayden , met Nat Friar , at a bar , and the two missioners of American irreverence formed a pious alliance . As Roxy expressed it , " Uncle Nat and I sure clicked . " To Nat , beauty was a dynamic force , culture was more revolutionarythan war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist himself and his mistresses and bank account ) was to be studied with reverence , and the more he held this gospel , the more impatientlydid Nat hear the adorers who gabbled or gurgled or wheezed about the arts ; who capitalized Beauty and Culture along with their social positions . If Roxanna could never have Nat Friar 's knowledge nor his gruff reverences , she had even more horrible synonyms for thep220word " fake , " and Nat was grateful . When Hayden went by himself to Nat 's villa , he often found Roxanna perched there , crosslegged on the couch , being cheery with Nat and Ada Baker . In Florence , Roxanna , being in a state of repentance and poverty , did not see any of Sadie Lurcher 's international set , glitteringlike broken glass edges , sharp as broken glass , unpleasant under the teeth as broken glass . They do not find Florence " smart , " nor do they often remain . For the most part , Hayden judged , Roxanna associated with that borderline assortment , the " American Students , " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaggy , drunken , late-walking and floridly abnormalor given to a confusion about private interests in wives . In general they were less noisy and self-advertising than their cousins in Paris , and Hayden felt that Roxanna was a colt now broken of loco-weed . His introduction of his quasi-cousin , Roxy , to Lundsgard was operatic and a success . He had invited Roxy , Lundsgard and Olivia to dine with him at the Cantina de ' Pazzi ( you will not find it under that name ) , in the basement of the venerable Palazzo Suoli . Under massive arches , the basement , clattery with dishes and the delighted chatterof tourists , wanders off into circular stone cubicles which hint of ancient tortures . The walls , scurfy with old blood , are coy now with travel posters , bull-fighter costumes from London sweatshops and paintings of carnivals in Venice  --  you were never quite sure whether it was Venice , California , or its bawdy older sister . To complete the Cantina 's charm for tourists , the managementhad ordered that bread sticks and free colored post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . As Hayden and Roxanna waited there  --  she had refused morep221than one cocktail  --  they saw Olivia and Lundsgard , coming in from their office work . Roxy 's lips lifted in an arch of delight at Lundsgard , and she crooned , " Oh , buy him for me , will you , Cousin Hay ? " And truly this Viking Lorenzo was something to enchant a maiden : broad-shouldered and his face all one beam of loving intelligence and conscious power and masculine resolution . Ile was hatless , his heroic head well back and his flaxen hair a coro -- net . With his sports jacket and gray open shirt , he had a purple and yellow Florentine silk scarf and , as he came near , on one masterful hand Roxy must have seen a vast opal ring . " Golly , that 's a lot of man in one consignment , " sighed Roxanna . Olivia was determined to be agreeable . She gurgled to her enemy , " How 's the job going ? " and even called her " Roxanna . " And Lundsgard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little city , Miss Eldritch and , speaking as a veteran here , may I announce that it has n't seen anything cuter than you since Dante tried to make Be-at-triss . Roxanna , we moriturus , salute thee ! " ( " Olivia is right ; he really will popularize learning in the States , though of course he 'll kill it on the way . " ) Roxanna was gushing to Lundsgard , " You do n't look as if Culture and Florence have stunted your boyish growth ! " He smiled on her as though she were a poor but worthy woman to whom he was giving thousands of dollars , dollar by dollar . " Roxy , the sneaking fact is that I 'm not cultured . I can teach that stuff , because I like college youngsters and I realize that all they want , or ever need , is to get a smattering of art and history , so when they become does or lawyers or manufacturers , they won'tp222look ignorant . But I 'm just a funnel , and with all your interviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dope on these flyblown European countries as I 'll ever get . " Roxanna answered as benevolently as he . " Olivia was only too darn kind . I 've never really done any big interviews  --  just real-life stories like interviews with Paris bartenderson do Yankee tourists prefer vol au vent or pickled pigs ' feet . No , you 're the goods on the culture  --  apparently . " Till now Roxy had been a true woman canvasser for the Lorry Party , and Olivia had difficulty in looking companionable when Lundsgard turned a shoulder on her and leaned into Roxanna . But with noticeably less reverence , Roxanna went on and Haydenthought he smelled malice : " But you have n't been a professor all the time , have you , Lo-renzo ? " " No , no . Lotta strings to my bow . " " You were in Hollywood ? " " Do n't know as the L. A. papers raved much about it , but yes , I did a little ham acting . " " I 'll bet all the girls hounded you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and astonishing to Hayden . He had never thought of that . He had never known any one whose autograph was sought after , who was so beautiful or clever that those fetish-seekers and magnified clinkers and general nuisances called autograph-hounds would ever course after him . But Lorenzo took his own tremendousness for granted , and with genial democracy he admitted : " Oh , they used to ask for my fist now and then . " " Little girls , I meant junior misses ' size  --  twelve to fourteen . "  |p223Lorenzo  was huffy . " No , not just junior misses ! I 've had some doggone beautiful , rich women ask me for an autograph ! " " I 'll bet . Seriously , Lorenzo , I was going to ask you for one myself and please , pretty please , give me one now before I forget it ! If it would n't bore you ? I want to keep it with Gene Tunney'sand Andre Gide 's and all those . " Hayden noted that the sheet which Roxy managed to find in her handbag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which did not look receipted . Lundsg.ud signed it with large , rolling L 's and looked delighted . Roxy purred . Olivia looked sour , then tried to look amused , and a great lady mannershe chuckled " Lorry , I 'm afraid I missed something . It never occurred to me to ask for your autograph  --  except as I do have your initials signed to so many gay little notes . " " I 'll bet you have ! " snarled Roxanna and went over to Lundsgardcomplete . They agreed that they were shrewd , generous , swift-moving Americans , with no nonsense . When Olivia tried to be lofty with their lowness and , to keep the debate fair , Hayden joined Olivia , the two hard-riding highwaymen teased them for the " solemncholyway you listen to a lot of snooty French and English and German cranks and fall for it when they claim you can write betterwith a pen than you can with a typewriter . " Lundsgard seemed to be expanding with appreciation , and he had a good deal of buoyant hydrogen in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been bored by Olivia 's eleganceof old ivory , and bored even by the fierce , channeled ardor with which she could vary her level coldness ; perhaps , for a time , he might find the tartness of the rosy apple that was Roxannap224spicier than the richness of Olivia 's pear . So Hayden meditated , but he himself found Roxy 's generous enthusiasm of voice somewhat flat and loud and quacking in competition with Olivia 's deep melodies . It was when Lundsgard was most admiring himself in Roxy 's mirror and most enjoying an advertisement of his friendliness with Prince Ugo Tramontana that the slippery minx twisted away . " Oh , yes , " confided Lundsgard , " I 've become quite a buddy of His Highness and I like ... " " A non-royal prince is not a Highness , " Roxy cackled . " Do n't be like that , and let ' em see the patched overalls you still wear under the luscious doctoral robe , dear . " " Why , you little stinker ! Me  --  overalls ? Lissen ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tailor in Hollywood two hundred and seventeen bucks a suit ! " roared the outraged Lorenzo . " And  --  you and your alleged knowledge of protocol and titles and that junk ! Lct me tell you Ugo is a mighty good intimate of mine and 1 hang around that grand old palazzo of his like I would around the Faculty Club and  --  everything 's worn out and the velvet worn and those gilt mirrors got liver patches on ' em , but he 's got more doggone medieval paintings and manuscripts by Poliziano ( I guess it is ) and old swords than you can shake a stick at , but he thinks I 'm swell , and he says I got what he calls a new vision , and he likes to try his theories out on me . He said so ! " Roxanna restored amity and even increased their alliance by bubbling , " And I 'll bet that 's true . He knows you are n't tied by a lot of bum traditions . Sure . He 's glad to have a smart scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you around . "  |p225Nobly  pleased , Professor Lundsgard said modestly , " It seens like he does . " Roxanna did not strike again till after dinner , when Lundsgard flamboyantly lighted a huge Havana , and she muttered , " My , my , what a big man that cigar is smoking ! I 'll bet Prince Ugo gets to panting when you smoke those El Imperialses around the palace ! " For once , Olivia giggled and Lundsgard looked wounded , butagain it did not take much of Roxy 's gamine art to restore him to self-admiration , to delight in his little pal . Hayden thought , " What a stupid , humorless , touchy oaf that man is ! Once Olivia 's fling is over  --  and I think perhaps it is now , when she 's seen him tossed around by a crazy juggler like Roxy  --  I 'll be able to snatch Olivia back from him , and I can hold her  --  for always ? I suppose so . " He was sorry for Lundsgard , driven in Roxanna 's tinsel reins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do so , blithely and tenderly and viciously . Poor Lorenzo , shaking a sceptre hung with jester 's bells ! " I think we should all be going home , " said Olivia tightly . " See you to your bachelor digs , Rox ? " said Lundsgard , the deft man of the world . " Uh-huh , " said Roxy . " Hay-den ! Let 's go ! " said Olivia.  |p226HA  Y D E N , especially loaned by kindness of Dr. Olivia Lomond for one evening , was dining with Roxanna among the students at Camillo 's . He was not pleased by the contemptuous hardness which Roxanna seemed again to be putting on . She was slightly too showy , in her old green dress with a white turbanpossibly modeled on the streamlined yet haremlike Marchesa Valdarno and a string of jade beads ; she was slightly too harsh and ambition-vaunting as she rattled , " I 'm getting my second wind . I think before long I 'll feel like leaving your nice little Florence . " " What do you mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Minnesota , or Omaha , Nebraska . Why , it 's about as big as Den-ver !

But as I was saying , pretty soon I may get going now and leave my set of nursing bottles for Mother Weepswell , and do a lot of freelance stories . 1 lave I got ideas now !

If you were building bungalows with sweety-pie yellow bathrooms , you 'd dream about waffles . If you 're learning Italian , you try to talk same to Heinie tourists and Svensk trippers . Okay  --  but do n't overdo your underdoing our ole American democracy , pal ! " You 're in much more peril than I am with my play at dissipation , which I can chuck so easy . Your danger is virtuous prissiness , and that 's a nastier vice than double martinis .

Sitting in San Miniato , looking at the altar-screen , I caught myself hummingCasey Jones ! Besides , you 're a true Westerner ; you 've heard some Old Timers sing hallelujahs . But most American kids today have only learned our ballads , rejoiced in our own tradition , when they 've heard ' em  --  if they could hear ' em over the smack of their chewing gum , on the radio , rollicked out by some ferocious Nevada thousand-dollar-a-week singing cowboy who was born in Pawtucket , Rhode Island , and learned his NativeWestern American melodies in the glee club at the Southern New Jersey School of Accountancy .

And take your O-ly-vya with you . And try not to push her off an Alp on the way ! "  |p230Hayden  said , " Well . . . " Roxanna might , he thought uncomfortably , be right . He might drift here into a negligent snobbishness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts would seem to master . He ought , he thought , to see more of Roxy and get more actively into soul-saving ; save hers from the suave brutality of female careerism  --  save himself from the fussy brutality of damningPerpetua every time she moved a book on his reading table . To an ironic Olivia , late that evening , after a good-natured but uncompromising parting with Roxanna , he explained that he really had to be neighborly with his old friend Roxy and not let the poor waif stumble into alien pitfalls alone . " You mean she 'll land softer if you stumble with her ? " said Olivia . " Go ahead . . . . Heavens , Hayden ! Do you suppose for one moment I could be jealous of a street Arab like your Rox -- anna ? Do n't insult me ! Spend all your evenings  --  and nights , too  --  with her , if it amuses you . " Olivia was too willing . He wondered , a thousand times , if the high spirits of Roxanna had not already enticed Lundsgard away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts and traffick -- ing for Hellenic manuscripts in Cyprus , was becoming silkenly double-faced . As a matter of fact his two or three dinners alone with Roxannawere but mildly devoted to her endangered morals . It proved that Roxy had , as most diners-out had not , as Olivia sniffily had not , his own trick of telling himself exclamatory storiesabout all of his fellow diners at a restaurant , and that was a trick well shared and inducing common excitement . At the Oliviero , most cosmopolitan restaurant in town , they picked outp231a French diplomat ( He was probably a Milanese manufacturer ) , a Chinese general ( probably Burmese ) . They looked sidewise , inconspicuously but intensely , at a quarreling young couple , and speculated , " I wonder if we had n't better go over and tell him that his girl has too rocky a jaw , for all her funny nose , and he 'd better duck before she shackles him for life ? " Always it was what Roxanna called " good fun . " And then she would infuriate him by returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar-hermit , and she would defend Lorenzoas a good fellow who had antagonized Hayden only by being his own honest , rollicking self . At the next dinner out of the three , Roxanna said to Lunds -- gard , derisively , " How 's all your lovely wives keeping , Lor-accio ? " " You mean my girl friends here ? Why , sweetness , I have n't got any except you and Livy , who 're both gone on that frozenfacedhermit , Hay . " " No , Professor , I do n't mean us . Wives , I said ! " Lundsgard 's " I du n no whacha talking about " was blurred and most unprofessional . " It 's none of my business and I do n't care a hoot , but I 'm a reporter , and do n't ever let them tell you I 'm not a good one . Anyway , a busy one . You 're always explaining to everybody that you 've never slipped into wedlock . You were just mean , when you were a rosy-cheeked young instructor with goldie tresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canned you for your he-man tyranny . " But I 've been snooping  --  pumping some of the American students here that you 've been chummy with . And I wrote a231p232few letters to a script-writer that I know in Hollywood . And I am now able to inform you  --  it may be no news to you , Lorry , but it will interest Livy : you were married , bell , book and neon lights , to two different cuties and got divorced by one after two years and by ' tother after eighteen months  --  grounds , in both cases , amnesia about who you were really married to . Oh , it 's okay , but I just feel we 'll all be happier , as simple , trusting American girls , if we could expect a consignment of home truth now and then ! " Olivia was rigidly furious . " I 'm sure I do n't know why we should hear all this . Mr. Lundsgard is my employer , and nothing else . I have no slightest interest in his private affairs of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He snorted , " So you took enough interest in poor old Lorry to really get busy and find out about him , heh ? Yuh , I guess your yarn is more or less true , Rox . I never could see why I should bother you folks with my troubles , but believe me , I could a tale unfold of a couple of the nastiest little tramps you ever heard of , if I had n't made it an iron-clad rule to never yap about my wounds but just bear ' em in silence . But I will say , " and he looked at Roxanna and then at Olivia as fondly as though they were two lovely little breakfast sausages and he a hungry hero , " that an awful lot of women hung around hoping to comfort me , after the obsequies . " " Did they , big boy ! " slashed Roxanna . " Do you mind if we forget all of this and talk about something more interesting ? " grated Olivia . Curiously , during the rest of that meal , Lundsgard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's evasivep233doubts when Roxy announced that the one thing in the world she wanted to do was to get invited to lunch with Sir Henry Bel-font . They all did go , as arranged : Ind tourist-guided by Mr. HaydenChart.  |p234THE  Y were only six at lunch : Sir Henry and Lady Belfont , Olivia and Roxanna , Hayden and Lundsgard , who had brought Roxanna in a taxicab and who seemed , on landing , to be more gurglingly intimate with Roxy than before her revelations of his multiple marriages . When Sir Henry found that Roxy was esteemed not only by the unimportant onlooker , Hayden , but by the favorite courtier , Professor Lundsgard , he was markedly attentive to her , and honored her with a portentous discourse on American Womanhood . You gather that he did not think much of it . Roxy listened pertly ; Lady Belfont pointedly did not listen at all but , with small sharp eyes , examined Roxy and apparently passed her . Yet after Sir Henry had accepted her and she should have put on the manners of a Belgravia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , " Gracious little lady , you are fortunate in being able to tarry for a while in the City of the Lilies . Most of your dreadful American females who come here , so uninvited  --  gauche schoolteachers and librarians and the like  --  remain only twelve hours or a day or two , and scamper on to Rome . " But Roxanna was not grateful for this implication of her superiority . She took from an overdecorated spectacle case of Florentine leather-work , with golden scrolls on blue and sealbrown , and put on a pair of Hollywoodized tinted sun-glasses , huge and aggressive affairs with harlequin frames of pink plastic . Through these insulting portholes she stared at Sir Henry , and blatted , " Maybe the poor darlings of teachers have n't enough cash to stick it out here any longer , and they got to ' scamper . ' Maybe they 'd stay here for years , too , if they 'd inherited a wad of money . " Every one , but especially Sir Henry and perhaps Roxanna herself , seemed to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive this curious campfollower of his favorite Lorenzo ; and he sailed on : " Conceivably that may be their melancholy plight , though I can not understand why middle-class persons , particularly your Americans , should be privileged to come to our Florence at all . Such ecstasy , Miss Eldritch , is no part of our common rights , like bread and beer ; it is a delightful good fortune which the prankishgods may bestow or deny at their will , quite unaccountably . " But all of your vast , marvelous country , Miss Eldritch , is full of false claims and assertions and astounding optimism . Childrenover there invariably address their fathers not with obedientreverence but  --  I shudder  --  ' Hya , Pop ' ! And them , I fancy , even your kind heart could scarcely categorize as ' poor darlings ' ! Eh ? " Said Roxy , " In the first place , mostly they do n't say it , and ifp236they did , it would just show they liked their dads enough to want to be chummy with them . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when Sir Henry had rambled , " When we consider that there once existed a Raphael , the insanities of these contemporary artists become not merely mawkish but blasphemous , " then Roxy struck again . She turned her impertinent Hollywood sun-glasses on Belfont , and she piped , " Maybe that 's what the old boys said about Rafe , too , when he was beginning . " Sir Henry looked stricken . Lady Belfont , behind the mild harem bars of a tiny lace handkerchief , seemed to be giggling . Hayden was definitely impatient with Roxy for her pointless rudeness ; he was definitely sorry for Sir Henry , whom he could see now as a pathetic old actor getting his first hisses and trying to take them gallantly . Hayden thought , " The man is a bore and a snob . He 's built up a social position to which he has to sacrifice everything . He has built a jail and shut himself up in it . He can never have any fun at all  --  never can laugh or talk easily or be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , lest he be seen . Poor , timid , wheezing Pekingese in the body of a mastiff ! I am extremely annoyed with Roxanna , as much for her pretentious spectacles as for her sauciness  --  which certainly does no credit to the good manners that we do have in Newlife . A splendid missionary of hate she is ! Mark Twain 's bumptious rustic , his Innocent Abroad . Still with us ! " Sir Henry was not enfeebled by Roxy 's impertinence , but angered . It was a long time since any one had dared to make small of such a formidable monument of guineas capped with a baronetcy . This was indeed his notion of blasphemy . But hep237counterattacked Roxy with stately tolerance for such small femalebugs : " My dear young lady , I agree that had he existed in your America , Raffallo would have been denounced in his own day . I quite understand that  --  quite . I am not shocked but only grieved by the irreverence and boorishness that is , perhaps , to be expected from such a lusty young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my own relatives belong to you good American people . " Then , to the horror of everybody except Lady Belfont , whose lips danced , and of the butler , who slapped a napkin over his mouth and fled from the room , Roxy demanded , " Sir Henry , do n't all of your own relatives belong to us good American peo-ple ? " " I beg your pardon ! " " Including your father and mother ? " " I beg your pardon ! " " I heard so many interesting things about you from a newspapermanwho used to be your secretary . You fired him  --  remember ?  --  for laughing when a dinky gilt chair busted under you . He was left stranded  --  bad . This fellow , the rat , he told me that you never saw England or the Continent till you were fourteen . You were born in Ohio and your Grampa Belfont  --  if that was the name  --  started the family fortunes during our American Civil War by selling adulterated drugs and shoddy uniforms to the North and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so monstrous that even the competent Hayden , the managerial Lundsgard were paralyzed , as Roxy went smilingly on : " This ex-secretary said it cost you sixteen years of living
