Trustbuster Stanley N. Barnes last week delivered a friendly warning to the auto industry . Said Barnes in a speech before the Manhattan convention of the Nation al Wholesale Dry Goods Association : " An undue concentration is becoming more and more sharply recognizable in the automobile industry , and if it continues , it will require action of some kind to solve . " His biggest objection : the Big Three last year accounted for 95.7% of auto sales v. 94.4% in 1954 . While General Motors kept a 50.3% share of the market , Chrysler boosted its share from 12.9% to 17.1%- " at the expense of Ford and not General Motors . " <P> Barnes did not say how much of the business Ford , Chrysler , or G.M. has a right to expect , or just how the Government could try to regulate their shares . Commented the Wall Street Journal : " We doubt very much if Mr. Barnes will ever be able to set any such figures , for the fact of the matter is that they are set by the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which allows a Government agency to force people to buy a car different from the one they want . " <P> Trustbuster Barnes last week solved a problem that had been worrying him in another big industry . Hotelman Conrad Hilton , whose growing empire ( 25 U.S. hotels , three more overseas with another five abuilding ) now stretches halfway around the world , signed a consent decree formally ending the antitrust suit filed against Hilton last April after he acquired the Statler Hotel chain . Hilton agreed to sell two hotels ( probably Washington 's Mayflower , Manhattan 's Roosevelt or New Yorker ) in addition to the two ( Los Angeles ' Town House , St. Louis ' Jefferson ) he has already sold . Hilton also promised not to buy any more hotels in these four cities before 1961 without first checking with the Justice Department .
