Legend of Lovers ( adapted by Kitty Black from the French of Jean Anouilh ) is provocative , but at a very high price . On a mythological foundation , Playwright Anouilh has reared a modern fantasy thick with symbolic scrollwork , ironic turrets , philosophic staircases , mystical passageways . Instead of reanimating the Orpheus &; Eurydice legend with new poignancy , the play ends by crushing it to death . <P> At a provincial railway station , a young street musician and a young actress are instantly and passionately drawn to each other . They spend an ecstatic 24 hours in a grubby Marseille hotel until , her past catching up with her , the girl flees and is killed . The lover has the chance to regain his Eurydice in life by shunning her face till dawn . He looks too soon , but has now the chance-which he embraces-of joining her in death . <P> Legend of Lovers is a bewilderment of contrasts : between realistic and romantic love , cynicism and idealism , the claims of life , impermanent and impure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather mawkish victory . The play has its merits . Amid so many varieties of love , it at least excludes Hollywood 's . There are vivid counterpointings , piquant juxtapositions . Eldon Elder 's set is splendidly striking ; and though Dorothy McGuire seems partly mystified and partly miscast as the girl , Richard Burton , as her lover , plays a difficult role persuasively . But the play grows tedious with saucy twists and lethargic with the fumes of Nachtkultur . When it does n't seem all too French , it seems much too German .
