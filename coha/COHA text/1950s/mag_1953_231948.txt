In the eight months since he stepped into Punch 's editor 's chair , Malcolm Muggeridge has been trying to put the punch back into Britain 's famed but ailing weekly humor magazine . Last week ex-Newsman ( London Daily Telegraph ) Muggeridge broke the most sacrosanct Punch tradition of all : he changed the cover for the first time in 109 years . For a special issue on British television , Muggeridge replaced Punch 's elves , capering gnomes and rogues with caricatures of Britons debating commercially sponsored-TV on the British Broadcasting Corp . ( among the recognizable faces : Press Lords Beaverbrook , Rothermere , Camrose and the Archbishop of Canterbury ) . " The BBC , " said Muggeridge with characteristic irreverence , " is a heaven-sent Punch target because it is one of those bloody things that takes itself seriously , believes it has a mission , and is pompous about it . All things Punch is interested in puncturing . " <P> News , Not Jokes . Tampering with the cover is not the only thing Muggeridge has done . Under his regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " If a joke has no relevance , or its connections are obsolete , it 's out " ) . As a result , putting Punch to press-once a quiet , timeless ritual-now has all the excitement of a city room covering a fast-breaking , big news story . Articles on the uproar in Iran are jammed in at press time , issues are held to make them more timely , reports on the United Nations , Korea and hydrogen bomb replace such old Punch standbys as essays on art colleges , traveling theaters or poems about water wagtails . Recently , when Tito came to London , Punch rebelled against treating Communist Tito with the usual diplomatic amenities , printed the harshest comment in the British press on his visit . <P> Muggeridge himself often writes a biting editorial , in a recent issue gave these satirical guides on how to be a successful British diplomat : " 1 ) When an international agreement is unilaterally denounced , insure that any formal protests you are instructed to make are as hesitant and equivocal as possible ... 2 ) Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demolition , not of construction . . . Every diplomat carries a peerage in his knapsack , provided only that he keeps retreating ... 3 ) Do not allow seeming setbacks to lower your spirit . Rather , they should be made the occasion for displaying even more complacency and self-satisfaction than before . . . 4 ) In politics , you should incline to the left . If you can combine this with ample private means and socially distinguished connections , so much the better .
