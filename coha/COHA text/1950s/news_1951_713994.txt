txt The seventeen Communist leaders freed on bail after their arrest June 20 were ordered yesterday to appear in court this morning to show cause why higher bail should not be set E IA a deterrent to further disappearances . United States Attorney Irving H. Saypol moved for revocation of the $171,000 bail posted for fifteen of the defendants by an organization calling itself the Civil Rights Congress , which is listed by the Attorney General as a ComImunist front . The Federal prosecutor also moved for increasing the bail of three defendants from $20,000 to $75,000 each , of twelve from $10 , - 000 to $50,000 each , and of one from $5,000 to $50,000  --  a total increase of $690,000 , from $185,000 to $875,000 . Mr. Saypol announced that his motions were the beginning of an effort to bar the Civil Rights Congress from posting bail for anyone . He said he would take action soon to cancel bail it has posted for about thirty aliens charged in deportation proceedings with being Communists . $500,000 Bail in 2 Years In the last two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500,000 . Besides the $171,000 posted recently , it put up $260,000 for the eleven Communist leaders conyicted in 1949 . Both groups were charged with criminal conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence . Other bail has been put up for alien Communists . The Civil Rights Congress forfeited $80,000 because four of the eleven convicted leaders jumped bail on July 2 , when they had been ordered to surrender to serve their jail terms after the Supreme Court upheld their conviction . It also forfeited $23,500 when Gerhardt Eisler , American representative of the international Communist movement , jumped bail in 1949 - while deportation proceedings were pending against him . When the seventeen were arrested June 20 , four others indicted with them escaped . These four and the four bail-jumpers include seven members or alternate members of the party 's national committee or ruling body . ' They are believed to have gone into hiding , possibly abroad , to continue to direct the conspiracy as an underground movement . The Federal Bureau of Investigation , searching for them , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , three trustees of the Civil Rights Congress bail fund have been adjudged in criminal contempt of court for refusing to tell the names of contributors to the fund , produce its books and records , or otherwise aid the Government in hunting for the fugitives . Federal Judge Sylvester Ryan held the trustees ' pleas of selfincrimination under the Fifth Amendment were not made in good faith . He sentenced Dashiell Hammett , writer of mystery stories ; and W. Alphaeus Hunton , secretary of the Council on African Affairs , which is listed by the Attorney General as a Communist front . each to six months in jail . He also sentenced Frederick Vanderbilt Field , millionaire helper of Communists , to ninety days in jail . iHearinr for Hammett and Hunton Hammett and Hunton spent their second night in the Federal House of Detention last night : They are to have a hearing before Judge Learned Hand of the Circuit Court of Appeals tomorrow noon on an application for bail pending appeal .

The orders to show cause why the bail posted by the Civil Rights Congress should not be revoked , and why other higher bail should not be posted , were signed by Federal Judge Alexander Holtzoff . They are returnable at 10:30 A. M. today before Federal Judge Vincent L. Leibell . Both orders were issued on the basis of affidavits by Assistant United States Attorney Roy M. Cohn . On the revocation of bail , he charged that the Civil Rights Congress bail fund trustees had no authority to post its funds as security for bail in a case of criminal conspiracy . Mr. Cohn also asserted the trustees had shown themselves to be " wholly irresponsible , " and that the bail fund was not a " qualified surety . " Referring to the refusal of the trustees to answer questions before Judge Ryan , Mr. Cohn said : " A guarantee and assurance by them to this court that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view of their refusal to state whether or not they even know the defendants for whom they would vouch to this court . " He pointed out that Judge Ryan had urged action to revoke the bail " without delay . " He also charged that the activities of the bail fund violated the state banking law . In the application to increase bail , Mr. Cohn urged that the bail of defendants Alexander Bittelman , Claudia Jones and Betty Gannett be increased from $20,000 to $75,000 each . Each is also under $5,000 bail in deportation proceedings . He asked that thirteen defendants be held in $50,000 bail each . These are Elizabeth Gurley Flynn , Pettis Perry , Alexander Trachtenberg , Albert F. Lannon , Simon W. Gerson , Louis Weinstock , Marion Bachrach , Victor J. Jerome , George Blake Charney , Isidore Begun , William W. Weinstone , Arnold A. Johnston and Jacob Mindel , Twelve of the thirteen have been held in $10,000 bail each , and Mindel in $5,000 . The seventeenth defendant , Israel Amter , has been held in ? $1,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his bad health . Ball For Two Posted By Others Two of the seventeen are out on bail supplied by others than the Civil Rights Congress . Marion Bachrach 's $10,000 bail was posted by her mother , Mrs. Mildred S. Abt , and Mindel 's $5,000 by Field personally . Mr. Cohn pointed out that after the eleven leaders were convicted in 1949 , bail was fixed at $20,000 for some and $30,000 for others , the higher bail being set for those involved in deportation proceedings . Referring to the bail-jumping by Gus Hall , Henry Winston , Gilbert Green and Robert Thompson , the prosecutor said : " Having taken advantage of every means our democracy affords for testing the validity of their convictions for two years , they fled from the jurisdiction and thereby affronted the dignity of this court and rendered its judgment of conviction and sentence a nullity . " He also said the four other fugitives all lived in this district and had family and other ties here that gave " every outward indication of amenability to the jurisdiction of this court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction of the court . Saying that eight , or one-fourth of the thirty-two party leaders indicted for criminal conspiracy , were now fugitives from justice , Mr. Cohn added : " It would seem that by the acts of these co-conspirators of the sixteen defendants , concerning whom this application is made , that indicted and convicted Communist party leadere feel free to , choose the time for flight from justice and to flaunt the jurisdiction of the court . " To allow these sixteen defendants to remain at large on such wholly insufficient bail would be a disregard of ordinary caution and common sense . The people of the United States are entitled to the presence of the defendants in the jurisdiction for purposes of trial and meting out of whatever punishment might be imposed when and if they are convicted . " By their own acts the indicted and convicted conspirators have proved that bail of $20,000 is insufficient to hold people in such circumstances within the jurisdiction . Consequently more substantial bail is essential to increase the chances of keeping these defendants within the jurisdiction . Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is respectfully submitted that the court should not stand idly in the face of this affront . We feel it incumbent on ourselves to make this motion to prevent a repetition of such abuse in the case of these sixteen defendants . "
