With the U.S. Government running into the red at the rate of $10,000 a minute , gaunt , grey Economist Edwin G. Nourse last week issued a stern warning . Said President Truman 's former chief economic adviser : the Administration 's reckless spending under its " pie in the sky " philosophy would , unless checked by tough-minded slashes , lead to " strain and possible breakdown " of the U.S. economy by 1951 . <P> Herman W. Steinkraus , Connecticut manufacturer ( Bridgeport Brass Co. ) and president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , saw the same danger . " Every group is pressing on Washington to get more , more , more , " said Steinkraus at a Cincinnati luncheon . . . " If we keep on this spending spree at the rate we are going . . . our tax burden will become well-nigh intolerable . " The nation , he added , is " very near that point which economists refer to as the ' peril point . ' " <P> But nobody struck at red-ink budgeting harder than General Electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the seat of authority in our Government has yet shown any real intention of paying off the debt , " said Wilson at a dinner in Philadelphia . Wilson called such negligence a " shameful dereliction to duty and immoral administrative betrayal of a great economic system . " He agreed with President Truman that the U.S. national income might well reach $300 billion in five years , but added : " We must take care that we are still dealing in dollars at the end of five years , and not in cigar coupons . . . We have had enough pretty words , enough vague promises to do better next year or next decade , enough planned devaluation of sound money , enough economic confusion . . . in short , we have had enough . . . We must . . . turn the tide of waste , extravagance and moral dishonesty which today characterizes the deliberate and calculated fiscal policy of this Government . "
