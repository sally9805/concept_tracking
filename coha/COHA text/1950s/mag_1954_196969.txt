In Western states last week , there was a feverish new boom in penny uranium stocks . People with a few spare dollars were taking flyers in such stocks as Uranium , Inc. , Sun Uranium , Atlas Uranium . Penny Stock , and Uranium Corp . of America . The fever started in Salt Lake City , spread to Denver , and to the San Francisco Mining Exchange . There , said President George Flach , the uranium boom has brought " the brightest prospects I 've seen around here in ten or 15 years . " <P> The man who started all the excitement was smooth-talking Jay Walters Jr .. 60 , who drifted into Salt Lake City about a year ago , just after Charlie Steen 's big uranium strike ( TIME , Aug. 3 ) . Starting with some claims , he formed the Uranium Oil and Trading Co. , capitalized at 3,000,000 one-cent shares . When brokerage firms shied away from selling them , Walters enlisted the help of a young customer 's man named Jack Coombs , who set up shop at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank &; Trust Co . Building . In a week , they sold $10,000 worth . With every $20 purchase , they threw in a cup of coffee . The stock quickly shot up as high as 8 , then slid down , but was still at 5 last week . <P> Land of Opportunities . Walters went on to form another company , Aladdin Uranium , sold $43,000 worth at a penny a share . It has since gone up to 5 . All the while , Walters has kept stockholders encouraged by cheery reports that do not always bear on the company 's prospects . Sample : " It is great to be able to pay taxes , and God bless America , the land of opportunities ... " <P> Coffeeman Whitney closed up his shop , moved seven floors up in the same building to form Whitney Investment Co. , and expects to gross $50,000 this year as a broker in penny stocks . Stockseller Coombs also started his own brokerage firm . Others got into the act , formed their own companies and began peddling stock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steen and ex-Automan Joseph Frazer , who have formed Standard Uranium , get their stocks listed on the American Stock Exchange , as scheduled . <P> The Big Strike . Some of the most spectacular gains have been in the stocks of old mining companies that rushed into uranium prospecting . The Mayflower Co. , originally organized to mine coal , started at 2 , shot up to 55 in three months , has since settled back to 10 . A few of the more solid issues are now traded by brokers , and over-the-counter trading is estimated at 200,000 shares a day . One broker , underwriting new issues , traded 11 million shares in a month . <P> So far , few of the new companies have struck uranium , or even worked their claims . Nevertheless , early investors have not lost money . The trick has been to get in on the ground floor of a new issue and then unload at double or triple the price to latecomers . The big lure is that there is uranium in the Colorado Plateau , and in some places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day when their company makes the big strike-and their penny stocks suddenly are worth dollars .
