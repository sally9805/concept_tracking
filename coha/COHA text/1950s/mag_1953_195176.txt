A DOG 'S HEAD ( 149 pp . ) Jean Dutourd-Simon &; Schuster ( $3 ) . <P> <P> When Madame Du Chaillu gave birth to a son with a puppy dog 's head , she was understandably distressed . " What will people say ? " she cried . <P> Except for his spaniel 's head with its " long , flapping ears and wide , gaping jaws , " little Edmond was a normal child . In moments of optimism , his father , M. Du Chaillu , saw no reason why Edmond should not take up law , for instance . But even as a youngster , Edmond developed some disturbing manners-such as fetching the daily paper between his teeth . He had , it seemed , " the soul of a man , " but he was dogged by what his father called " canine predestination . " <P> School was a trial for Edmond . " Your classmate has a very fine dog 's head , " said the teacher to his class on Edmond 's first day . " He has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to tease him . I rely on your good manners , your charitable natures and your kind hearts . " But these virtues are not well developed in schoolboys . Edmond 's colleagues chained him to posts in the school yard and forced him to bark . " Who takes you out before breakfast , " they asked , " your mother or your father ? " <P> Shaved to the Hide . After his schooling came military service . " Ah-ha ! " barked the first sergeant when Edmond reported . " He 's trying to be smart ... He wants to attract attention . Very well ! He shall learn . . . " Edmond 's head was shaved to the hide , a forage cap was set atop it . " Eyes . . . front ! " bawled the sergeant . " Du Chaillu , keep those jaws shut . . . D' you want a bone ? . . . I 'll learn yer . . . I 've broken in tougher bastards than you ! " <P> Edmond 's parents were so happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed some money into his hand and begged him never to come back . But a kindly bank manager hired Edmond as a clerk , and Edmond did so well ( the customers appreciated his " good breeding " ) that he might have remained a bank clerk forever , had not a female employee played tag with his trusting , spaniel-like affections . Edmond began to gambol in the stock market , and soon became wealthy . He bought a painting by Rosa Bonheur called Sheepdog Pursuing a Sheep and Woman with Dog by Matisse . <P> Edmond was prominent in high society . He discovered that " ninety per cent of women are for sale " and proceeded to buy them . Thanks to the bank notes in his hip pocket , his head began to seem attractive rather than repellent to fashionable people . Above all , he found a woman who genuinely loved him . <P> And Taught a Lesson . French Author Dutourd might well have dropped his story at this point , had it been his intention simply to excoriate the human race for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he presses on in his terse , deadpan prose to teach a lesson to the afflicted of the world as well . The happier Edmond becomes , the more worried he grows . The more his mistress , Anne adores him , the more convinced he is that she must be mad to love a man with a dog 's head . He sends her to a psychiatric hospital for treatment ; when she comes out , she is as bad as ever .
