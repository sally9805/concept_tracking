In its 16th Century heyday , the Imperial and Royal Institute of the Pietra Dura ( Hard Stone ) was one of the busiest places in Florence . The duties of its craftsmen members : turning out the intricate designs of inlaid marble and semiprecious stones with which the Medici loved to decorate their palaces and chapels . After the Medici , the art , known as stone intarsia , went out of fashion ; but a handful of institute members kept its difficult technique alive , occupied themselves mainly with repairing intarsia objects in Florentine museums and copying the old-fashioned designs . <P> Last week some strikingly new intarsia was on display in Manhattan . In place of the elaborate baroque scrolls , shells and garlands of the 16th and 17th Centuries , there were surrealist nudes reclining in desolate plateaus , a composition of pistols and playing cards after William Harnett , gay conglomerations of striped balloons , kites and butterflies-all laid out in marble , malachite , lapis lazuli . <P> The man who has done most to modernize the old Florentine craft is Artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , Blow , an old intarsia admirer and part-time resident of Florence , called together the few remaining craftsmen , convinced them that some new ideas might help revive their art . He offered financial help , the use of his studio , and a few of his own designs . <P> By now , five intarsia workshops in Florence , using the same age-old techniques for cutting , fitting and polishing the stone by hand , are supplying compositions to dealers in Florence and the U.S. Blow reports especially encouraging sales in Texas : " People from Texas are crazy about designs of pistols and playing cards . " With his current exhibit almost sold out , Blow has already commissioned designs from Italian Painters Giorgio de Chirico and Massimo Campigli , is hoping to interest Picasso , Braque and Miro . " Intarsia may be a minor art , " says bluff Dick Blow , " but hell , it 's better to turn out a good piece of minor art than a bad piece of major art . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
