EAGLE DAY A Story by Esther R. B. Wagner Drawings by G. Hunter Jones A S Marina Sinek sat with her second cup of coffee , staring out the window in her housing-project dinette , a large eagle suddenly swooped into her yard and sank his claws into a blue doll-blanket left there by her neighbor 's daughter . He crouched for a long moment , milking a kind of backwater motion with his huge wings . He took off again with the blue nest-ornament hanging limply beneath his body , caught Marina 's eye , and gave her a dirty look as he lurched through the air past her window . She sat transfixed , cup held motionless below her lips . It was this sort of thing that obscured for Marina the fact that she lived in a subdivision lull of repulsively similar little houses , painted in offensive California tones of cobalt , pistachio , black raspberry . So she did ; but three slim redwoods spired upward from the edge of her yard into the sky , and far off , the eagle melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well begun . She was going to drive to the Marpessa Union High School , where she taught the senior classes in College Preparatory English ; she had an extra hour at her disposal because of a Morning Pep Rally which emptied her classroom ; she was going to make known to the administration that her first year was to be her last , that she was going back East ( and she meant East , by God , not Chicago or Iowa , the ordinary Marpessa meaning of the word ) to take a very satisfactory appointment on the staff of her own old school , Miss Thurston 's august , prestige-enshrouded institution of which most citizens of Marpessa , California , had never heard . She had come West after six years of conventional labors in accustomed grooves , lured by high salary , by a picture of black rocks in a blue bay off Marpessa Head , by the fact that nobody in her town , or at great Madson College , or at Miss Thurston 's had ever heard of Marpessa , or had the slightest idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco . Further , it was the unlooked-for , exotic chance to experiment with public-school teaching . Marina 's education had nothing to do with anything which the great teachers ' certification bodies could recognize as Education . She had a bachelor 's degree , with distinction in English , from Madson College , of which even Marpessa had heard . She had taught for six years in a famous private school of the Thurston type . She possessed an M. A. in English from a massive metropolitan university . All this , in the mysterious world of American public-school teaching , entitled her to a Provisional , or Substandard , Credential , making it barely legal for her to teach , on the condition that she pursue Education in the form of various courses in classroom management ( students get sleepy after lunch unless you open the window ) , adolescent psychology ( adolescents are likely to have problems with their skin and their parents ) , and testing ( California Mental Maturity , True-False , Establishment of Norms and Medians ) . But substandard salaries in the Golden State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far above quite good salaries in the schools where she was prepared to teach in a normal course of events , that she felt she could afford this excursion . She amused herself in the classes of Dr. George Hoff , Ed. a , State University of Washington , counting his lapses from conventional grammar and justifying them to herself in terms of the new , progressive semantics . She attended a course in Guidance Techniques and sent the Professor 's mimeographed material back to her friends at home with sic written in her own hand at regular intervals ; these materials provided her and the friends with many moments of harmless pleasure . But the letter from Thurston 's was a recall to her station . A vision of the little upturned faces in those pleasant classrooms rose before her , with a comparative vision of the improbable visages of her senior classes here . The confrontation confused her for a moment ; something rose uneasily in her throat ; her vision blurred . What ? all right , it had been great , they were great , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these trips . Scenery and wild life , the redwoods , the eagle , the mountain lion she had seen trotting along the Old Marpessa Road like any Dane or Golden Retriever  --  that sort of thing was a part of the soul of this scene , not just of its surface , as was Marina herself . She was a tourist . At Madson were lawns , little slopes . The rhododendrons and azaleas were bushes , not trees . Professor Klein sat under the oak tree in the Common Room garden , looking like an old frog on a lily-pad and now and then emitting some gentle , time-honoured croak . My country , my people ! she thought fiercely , all the way to the school , and hung on to the thought as she darted into the little office where the mailboxes were stacked in white-bristling tiers . A c.I.J R T note summoned her to the presence of the vice-principal , Joe Ragusa , and she felt a sudden new flood of exultation . With longing she thought of the moment when she would tell Ragusa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know at last that never again would she hear his grating , graceless voice , his unhallowed English , his remarks on Education for Citizenship ( " What we 're concerned with here primar'ly , in my opinion , is what kids kin learn in a larger context about social relationshups , in terms of getting along with other people " ) and his views on the College Preparatory Program ( " I could of wished it was being done a whole lot diffrent than what it is " ) . " This , here , " he said , without rising , thrusting at her , as she came in , a slip she had filed the day before , reporting the fact that she had ejected from a class one Gary Miles for disciplinary reasons . She was required to file a formal report , but with such formalities Marina often failed to concern herself . Her Principal and Division Head , the large-minded people who had hired her , tended to view with tolerance her grave imperfections in the clerical aspect of her job . But this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ragusa , who considered Marina with a genuine puritan horror as a kind of outrageous luxury , a frill of the laciest nature , a creature who could not possibly make the slightest contribution to the social adjustment of any student . He would , if pressed to articulation , have said that she could be good for nothing but to give them IDEAS . She now took up the slip and waved it airily , assuming her giddiest manner . " Oh , that Gary Miles , " she said . " D' you really want to know what he did ? " " It sure would help , " he answered heavily , " seeing as I got to make out these reports . " " Well , " said Marina chattily , deeply enjoying herself , settling herself uninvited in his other chair , with a flip of silk scarf , a rattle of bracelet , a peeling-off of pale impractical glove , " I was starting an oral quiz  --  you know , when you ask them questions and have them tell you the answers " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parentheses ? " and they 're all supposed to sit quiet and listen while each individual talks . Well , all of a sudden I hear this snip , snip . Miles is cutting his fingernails with a great big toenail clipper . I told him to cease and desist , I mean stop , and there was a little silence . Then another student started to talk , and sure enough , snip snip , only more like Bang , Bang . So I kicked him out , " and she beamed upon Ragusa her most social smile . His face was taking on the congested look it so often wore when lie was dealing with Marina , or even with the thought of Marina . Suddenly she spoke in a different tone . " Mr. Ragusa . Miles should n't be in that class . He ca n't read the texts , he ca n't write the themes . He ca n't even listen to the others . He 's the only one like that in there . I 'll have to flunk him . The Head said you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ? " These were the only straightforward words she had ever spoken to Ragusa , and she listened to their urgent sound in faint astonishment . Was she so serious ? " I thought it ud do him some good , " said Ragusa . " He needs to-associate with that other type of kid , your special ones , Miss Sinek . If I was to ask you what his background was , would you know ? You ever look him up ? " Unsmiling , Marina stared at him . He handed her a dirty folder . She opened it and read the first paragraphs of the school psychologist 's report on Gary Miles . She closed her eyes tight for a moment in deep exasperation over one of his occupational phrases ; then she opened them , and her eyes fell on one different sentence : " His father violent : served one term for assault and another for manslaughter . " She read no more . - , ? " Miles came back to school of his accord , after his folks ud taken him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang around those other kids any more , go in the loggers ' joints . What harm 's it do you , having him in there with your college-prep kids ? Bright as all that , are they ? " " No , Mr. Ragusa , they 're not that bright , " said Marina with deadly seriousness . " Every day I have a battle , a real battle , trying to make up for things , trying to get them to see what it 's all about . They can see , that 's the difference  --  they 're beginning to  --  why they have to know Pallas Athena is not a building and why they have to think about plays written 350 years ago , and why when they go to college , they 'll he stuck into General Courses , even at the State College now , and have to hear about Plato , Socrates , St. Thomas ! " An expression of terrible weariness settled on the face of Joseph Ragusa . " You want to know what harm Miles does in there . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quizzes , and he ca n't hand in the work . It 's not good . It 's only a fake good it does him , pretending he 's in there with them . I 'll help him do something , in my free periods . But those classes are n't planned to provide people with the right associations , Mr. Ragusa . Miles ca n't do the work , Mr. Ragusa ! " The lean beautiful face of her student William Gustafson , amateur astronomer , impassioned student of three lluxleys , rose before her mind 's eye ; the thick glasses of Maria Manzoni , bookish , word-loving , avid of discovery , glinted in her thoughts . She caught the eye of Joseph Ragusa as she rose , and a long , powerful gaze passed between them , in which each read the depth and passion of the other 's enmity , distilled now , purr , purged of all personality . As she paused outside the door , looking abstractedly inward at her own seriousness , she realized that she had neglected to deliver her punch line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E ran up the concrete stairs leading to the long outdoor corridor that stretched along the entire front of the New Building . The doors of the empty classrooms stood open to the spring sunlight ; in her own room stood two waiting students . She scrabbled among papers on her desk , and spoke to the student standing at her elbow . " Talk about your Aristotle paper , Sandra ? Listen to this , Bart , " she addressed the boy , " you 'll like it , I think , " and he smiled gently , his large face lit with pleasure as always when Marina praised any student . ' " The whole long peripeteia of the tragic plot in Macbeth , from the first minute that Macbeth puts up his hand to speed his fate , proceeds through sub-agons to katharsis when .. . ' 1 love sub-agons , ' " said Marina . " I kinda thought . you would , " said the girl . " . . . perhaps Shakespeare do n't ( here Marina scowled fiercely ) seem too certain at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unity of action ' " ? Marina flashed upon the two of them a wonderful combination of smile and glower -- as when he shifts from Scotland to England with a time-shift right in the middle of the space-shift . ' " Marina grinned . " ' Shakespeare do n't write like Sophocles , but Aristotle would of liked him for the same things he liked Sophocles for , even if they came out so different . ' " Marina explained why she liked the paper in spite of its glaring deficiencies . Bart told her that lie would need no extra scholarship for college next year , since he had made an arrangement to live in a professor 's house and work for expenses . He could make four hundred in the woods , easy , that summer , he told her . Marina smiled , but her eye caught Sandra 's , and to her horror she saw the girl 's face suddenly streaked with tears . God ! thought Marina , in alarm , but no outbreak occurred . Sandra said in a very soft , thin voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave school ! 1 withdrew my scholarship application . I ca n't come back at all , not even next week . " Marina 's mouth dropped open . " Well , it 's that I 'm gon na have a baby . " Bart 's forehead creased in gentle concern . Panic stuck in Marina 's throat , but she swiftly remembered  --  the girl tens married , to the driver of a huge lumbering logging truck . Twenty of her senior girls were married . She stared helplessly at the girl . The Morning Pep Rally was over and the corridors full of students ; exhilarated by their lateness , their escape from earlier classes , they came surging into the room , cavorting , haw-hawing . Marina shook her mind free of thoughts of Shakespeare-loving Sandra Clary and her truck-driver husband . She stood up to face her class . Rapidly she ascertained that during the class period the day before , as they sat with a substitute while she judged an inter-class debate , they had twiddled and done nothing . Eyes flashing , voice rising and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castigated her charges . Were they aware of the approaching deadline for this , the new requirements of that ? She hissed , grumbled , exhorted . Gradually there beg-an to come over their upturned and open-mouthed faces that pressurized look Marina felt she should see there upon occasion . She dished out some individual assignments , wrote some depressing instructions on the board , and tore into the day 's business . Their discussion of Conrad 's " Outpost of Progress " as a " horror story " was punctuated by the sudden cries of outrage , flights or invective , bursts of laughter , and melting glances of approval which such sessions with her Marpessa students invariably invoked in her . The conversation ended on a comic note , and Marina dismissed her chortling class , to sink down at her desk for a moment . Her eye fell on a sentence from a waiting theme : " My real father was the boss of all the woods around Crescent City . " The Head ol ' her division passed briefly by her door , and Marina told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it fixed up about next year . " Next year , " she repeated stupidly as the older woman disappeared , for through the brief conversation she had been thinking , " Next year , no one will tell me his real father was the boss of all the woods around Crescent City , and no one will ... " Well , face it ! The students at Marpessa High had no need of her . She was for them an incident , a trip they took , a scenic railway . Sandra Clary dropped out , Bart Connors went on ; under their own steam , because of or in spite of their private pressures , with nothing she could do either hindering or helping much . She had taught Sandra the word for agora . But to kid herself that she was some kind of big deal for them was mush . They loved to hear her laugh , to see her lose her temper . She could make them work . She suited them . But the long sharp claw in the whole thing was that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so angry . Her energies had never been so taxed , nor so inexhaustible . She simply was not tired , she simply was not through . But was she going to let this fact flap away with her , was she going to hang limply and be used ? There was plenty of room in the world for her to live and enjoy herself , to practice her profession in a rational manner . Stay , take the required course in Audio-Visual Aids , fight the weird battle , quiet , patient , submarine , forever waged by her Division Head and her Principal against Ragusa , Dr. Hoff of the State College , all the other strange forms of life fastened by draining suckers , like sea-lampreys , on the gleaming sides of American mental life ? B I T T E R L Y she began to scrawl on the board the poem her next class would discuss that day . The title stretched along two squares of the board : AN IRISH AIRMAN FORESEES HIS DEATH As always , the last lines flowed smoothly from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely impulse of delight Drove to this tumult in the clouds . I balanced all , brought all to mind , The years to come seemed waste of breath , A waste of breath the years behind . In balance with this life , this death . She looked at these lines with sudden alarm . But this was no time for reflection on new meanings . Her class came flooding in , dumping popcorn boxes in her wastebasket , gulping last cookies . Marina knew suddenly that she had had no lunch . They saw the handwriting on the board and knew what was in store . " Oh-oh ! An-AL-a-sis ! " Grinning , they settled into their chairs and began to pop their notebook rings , click down the points of their ballpoint pens , flap their 86 EAGLE DAY paper . Silence fell while they read , lips moving , and thought . Gravely , sturdily , tentatively they began to discuss the poem with Marina . When she got to the lines My countrymen , Kiltartan 's poor , No likely end could bring them loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they meant . " Means they 're perfectly okay up in Kiltartan Cross , " said Loretta Jaynes in the first row , " no matter what he does . " Marina thought this over , chewing her lip and staring out the window . But she did not want to pursue it . Her student John McClure spoke loudly and suddenly , unable to wait for recognition , sure all year , but especially since his brilliant performance on the national scholarship examinations , of his ability to command her attention . " Ya know what I think ? That guy 's got a Tragic Flaw ! " " What ? " said Marina weakly . " A Tragic Flaw ! You know , like in the other stuff , Macbeth . He likes this strong-stuff sort of kick , ' tumult in the clouds . ' Wants things to be live . Does n't care what-all . Just does n't want things to be dead , all fixed up beforehand . " " So that 's Tragic Flaw ? " said Loretta , twisting in her seat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy 's Tragic Flaw , like I said . As I said . That kind is trouble . He 'll ruin everything for himself , for the crash alma bang . Poem is about Irish guys can stay home , is it any fight of theirs ? But no , it is , because he likes it . That type . They do n't care do they cook their goose . They got ta have that old red blood . " Loud laughs and crude comments put an end to this striking recitation . Marina established order , finished her analysis , got her assignments in before the bell rang . McClure sought her eye as he went out , giving her his Jack Horner , plum-on-thumb look that marked the close of all his insights . Marina made a lace at him and told him to go look up " hubris " in the big dictionary . I N HER next class Gary Miles , the felon 's son , sat sober and motionless while the class sighed and squirmed , writing their theme on Aristotle and Macbeth . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , wrote spasmodically until the bell rang . Marina collected the papers and looked at his as they filed out . He had written : I do nt dig this Shakesp , this Macb stuff like I tried to tell you but yo wuldnt listen . Well I read this other book , maybe I could tell you about that , anyway it was on that list you gave us . European Short Stories . There was this little boy in one of them stories and he went out to a farm some uncle had , he was a city boy . He was confused when he got there but the green come up in his face and the bees in those old trees , and he knew he liked it . Then one day he saw this pig , this pig that was like him , sort of fat but nice , like him , and it was being killed for the sausage and the bacon . He new it was alright but he also new it was not alright , but terrible . So he poison a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible way with clubs and blood . The chidkens werent like him but the pig was , all the more reason for seem they did nt have to have that terrible thing . It did nt say this but I cold see that was what he ment . I thot I was there . You say its so corny to say " he writes so 1 thot I was there " and I know the kids just A STORY say it , but I do nt just say it . I thot I was there . The kid in the story , he thot he was the pig when the pig was killed , well I thot I was there in the story . That anther , he has a lot of what you keep saying , scope , the biggest , the biggest look , to see into a small little boys bead like that . Marina read this in a minimum time but with a maximum attention . She felt for another time that peculiar emotion , not unrelated to the stirring of a new love , felt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hitherto unsuspected , of Material . A long preview of the next three months with Miles unreeled itself in her mind : the struggles , the boredom , the excitement ; the moments when she would think , Idiot ? and he would think , Old Snotbox ? He would not learn to write sentences on William Gustaf-son 's and Maria Manzoni 's time ; but she would get him , by God , she would . The new sort of sentence he would be able to write existed in this preview in form though not in content . She felt its shape . She hurried down to Ragusa 's outer office , Filled in a slip , and darted in with it to his inner office . " Miles do something new ? Something tough on the College Prep class ? " he inquired , looking savagely at the piece of paper as it lay on his desk . " Yes , he sat there while they wrote on Aristotle and Macbeth , " said Marina . " Then he wrote on something else . He was nice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong in there , Mr. Ragusa . " I 'm going to take him in my free period every ( lay . I 'm just going in to check it with the Head . I know it 's just a bit on the illegal side , with the laws about those periods and all , but valuable commodities must be , at certain moments in our history , bootlegged . " " Hear you could get a job at the college , " he said suddenly , and on his expressive face there shone a look of hungry longing for what might be . " Maybe , but I would n't take it , Mr. Ragusa . I want to stick around for those sessions after the tests , when you decide about the special-ability classes for next year . The Counselor and the Chief are quite interested in all that . They 've been asking me for my ideas , " she said , smiling , and I have some ideas , not only about that , but about some of the lower-classmen 's programs , too , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his upturned face , trading ruthlessly on her popularity with parents , her prestige with School Board and Principal , bending over the serried volumes of the National Education Association journals which edged his desk . He looked at her wordlessly . She gestured with her head toward the report , bared her teeth again , and left hint . B U T the glow left her as she raced back upstairs . She meandered through her last class in a daze . In the last quarter-hour while they read , she pawed listlessly through a pile of themes from the clay before , concerning one class 's thoughts about their future . As she had known would be the case , they ranged madly from " I have applied for a Seven Colleges Scholarship , and will enter Radcliffe or Bryn Mawr if I am lucky , to do my work in chemistry , " to " Mom thinks I should be a beautician , I love to fool with hair . " But they all could do the work she asked of them ; what they did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew from memory and imagination , quiet attentive faces , giving her what she expected , getting what they expected  --  she saw them and she knew them in her mind , in a mental convulsion of farewell . Her class left ; she sat motionless amid the roars of the exhaust pipes of the school buses . She sat for a long time , then got up from her desk and walked to the window . The old-rose light of Marpessa County afternoons suffused the bizarre landscape . At its north edge , the school campus dropped off a cliff ; below it , the Marpessa Plywood Company clanged and roared , and the sawdust-burners , grotesque and beautiful in Marina 's eyes , belched out their thick saffron smoke . Southward she stared into the old graveyard of the town , which fringed the school property on that side , and where she often walked at noon . A huge myrtle tree spread at its center , exhaling lilac color and soft bitter scent into the air . The forms of the mausoleums belonging to old Marpessa families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters , shone gently against the background of sombre yew and cypress . " Drowned in the Mad River , Nevermore to Roam , " remembered Marina , thinking of epitaphs on the stones . " Drowned in the Mad River , nevermore to roam ! " thought Marina , thinking of herself and of American public-school teaching . Between the burners and the graveyard she leaned her hot forehead on cool glass and wept ; feeling , deep in the hidden recesses of her body and her spirit , writhing , entangling , the dark irrational coils of ineradicable love .
