A column of army trucks last week roared into the big bamboo-and-thatch camp that had been hastily built at Misa-mari in the jungles of Assam . The tailgates were dropped and out stepped 92 Tibetans , ranging in age from nine to 70 , the advance party of 10,000 refugees fleeing the Red oppressors of their homeland . <P> Lama 's Gold . Many of them had been footslogging for almost two months . There were 15 lamas from the great monasteries of Sera , Ganden and Drepung , " the three pillars of lamaism . " A young man of 18 , wearing a purple cassock over a yellow shirt and knee-high boots , was the In carnate Lama of Sera monastery , whose predecessor 22 years ago had led the group of monks who found the present Dalai Lama near Lake Koko Nor ( TIME , April 20 ) . He had fled Lhasa three days after the March 17 escape of the Dalai Lama . Smiling ruefully , he explained that he had been forced to abandon his monastery 's treasure to the Red Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pens and a gold wristwatch . <P> In its flight across Tibet , the Sera Lama 's party had picked up other bands of refugees . There had been a brush with a Red Chinese patrol , but they escaped under fire , protected by their 25 guards - who were required to hand over their antiquated guns to Indian troops as they crossed the border . Only one of the party -a monk from Ganden-was wounded ; he had been struck in the head by bullets from a strafing Red plane . <P> The change of climate from the mountain valleys of Tibet to the steaming Assam jungle affected the Tibetans more than had their forced march , and they were plagued by leeches , mosquitoes and dimdam flies . After bathing in a nearby river and while their heavy clothes were sprayed with DDT and soaked in disinfectant , the refugees were ludicrously garbed in outsized bush shirts and trousers . On receipt of frantic orders from New Delhi , the Indian camp commandant refused newsmen any chance for further interviews , explained blandly : " Some misguided people may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make matters confusing for you if you speak to them . " <P> Barbed Wire &; Police . In New Delhi , Prime Minister Nehru was still , in the interests of peace and quiet , trying to deaden the impact of what was going on in Tibet . But he gently ridiculed Red China 's claims that the refugees were all " upper-strata reactionaries , " by pointing out that it was " obvious " that among 10,000 refugees " a large number must represent the common man of Tibet . " He insisted the Dalai Lama had perfect freedom in India " to say or do what he likes , to go back to Tibet , to remain here or to go anywhere else . " What about the barbed wire and officious police who made any approach to the God-King impossible ? The police , smiled Nehru , as if it were not his responsibility , " have a way of throwing their weight about . " The only orders given them have been " to be careful about the Dalai Lama 's security . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
