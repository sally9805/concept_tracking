The flap-footed , tank-bearing skindivers have opened a new frontier in archaeology . Last week Piero Nicola Gargallo , 30 , a skindiving Italian marquis , was telling how he found the ancient Etruscan seaport of Pyrgi . On the Tyrrhenian coast just north of Rome , the city is known from historical records , but only minor traces have been found on dry land . <P> Local fishermen guided Gargallo to a reef where they sometimes fished up relics for sale to tourists . One mile offshore , he found weed-grown ruins , chunks of cut marble , and " something that looks like a street or a pier stretching along the bottom for about 100 ft . " The ruins are in water 30 ft. to 50 ft. deep , and they cover 20 acres . <P> Little is known about the Etruscans , a talented , highly civilized people who ruled Rome from about 600 B.C. to 500 B.C. The Etruscan written language has not been deciphered , and even the origin of the people , supposedly in Asia Minor , is known from tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were ostentatiously shocked by their sexual customs , e.g. , Etruscans sometimes made love at the dinner table , and young girls earned their dowries by prostitution . <P> To coordinate the explorations of his skindiving friends , Gargallo has organized the Mediterranean Institute of Underwater Archaeology . In his apartment off Rome 's Piazza , di Spagna , he has a map of Italy and Sicily with colored pins indicating the site of 20 to 30 ruins known to his skindivers . There is a big underwater city near Venice . Another , off Mondragone , north of Naples , runs along the bottom for nearly three miles . <P> Most of these drowned cities are unexplored and unaccounted for . No one knows how their ruins got so deep underwater ; the general level of the Mediterranean has risen only a fraction of an inch since glacial times . Gargallo hopes that his underwater ruins may hold the answer to some Etruscan mysteries . " Water , " he says , " is destructive , but it can also preserve . Mud gives protection from time , weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some relics last almost indefinitely . "
