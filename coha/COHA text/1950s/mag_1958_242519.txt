Only last July the flames of aggression blazed so high in the Middle East that the U.S. and Britain dispatched emergency fire fighters to Lebanon and Jordan , and the whole world scrambled for the summit in asbestos suits . Last week , on the strength of International Fire Chief Dag Hammarskjold 's diplomatic finding that the flames were now well under control , the U.S. and Britain announced that they would pull all their men out of the two little countries by month 's end . <P> To " keep under purview the adherence of all " Arab neighbors to the amity pledge they gave in last summer 's U.N . resolution , Hammarskjold set up in Jordan 's capital of Amman a new " U.N . organ , " in the person of Under Secretary Pier P. Spinelli of Italy . He in turn would have other watchdogs in Beirut and Damascus - but not in Cairo , where President Nasser insists there is no need of any . <P> Though his crown is as precariously perched as when the British arrived last summer , Jordan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own show , released political prisoners in droves , and talked blissfully of his hopes for better relations with his Arab neighbors . Perhaps he counted on Nasser 's being too busy with his own internal problems , or too leary of Israel to start something . <P> As for luckless Lebanon , it showed signs of turning into an uglier situation than the one the U.S. went in to reverse . This time it is the Christian half of the populace , rallying closer to former President Camille Chamoun than they did when he was in office , who are the rebels . Chamoun now excoriates the U.S. for endorsing a regime that contains only his enemies . Just as Chamoun swung too Westward for Lebanon 's Moslems to stomach , now the rebelled Cabinet swings too far toward Nasser for Chamoun and the Christians to tolerate . <P> Led by a tough street mob belonging to the Christian Phalange , * the new rebels have tied up the streets and shops of Beirut with strikes and rioting more effectively than the Moslem rebels ever did . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new President , Fuad Chehab , was providing continuing proof of his immense capacity for doing nothing . As another 1,000 U.S. soldiers were evacuated , U.S. officials fretted over the danger of religious warfare between Christians and Moslems . <P> <P> * Modeled after the disciplined Fascist groups its leader admired on a trip to Italy and Germany in 1936.
