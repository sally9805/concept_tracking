The Hollywoods are full of tall . tawny-blonde pinups who have fared better on film than Lola Jean Albright , and the jukeboxes rattle with records made by singers who sell more songs . But when Lola 's latest release , Dreamsville , went out to the deejays last week , its fans were readymade . For Lola is Edie Hart , the slim , smoky-voiced saloon singer , the girl wrho keeps the fires warm for TV 's Private Eye Peter Gunn , the blue-eyed sentimentalist who can whisper into the mike and convince a million televiewers that she is alone with each one of them . The songs may be old-They Did n't Believe Me , It 's Always You-but the voice comes fresh and insinuating , husky with promise . Under the spotlight , the face may seem sad , even a bit tired , but most men look twice . <P> Quarters for Corn . Few girls get a break from the jukebox trade these days ; the quarters clink in the slot for the grinding corn of Fabian or Frankie Avalon . or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must settle for less , deserves more . She has been learning her trade , scrabbling at the edges of show business , ever since she sang Listen to the Mocking Bird at her home-town Y.W.C.A. in Akron 25 years ago . She was a gawky ten-year-old then , defiant of her parents ' dislike of anything that smacked of entertainment . Today , at 35 , she sometimes concludes that show business has been defying her . <P> Lola has behind her countless different jobs-radio actress , stenographer , switchboard operator , photographic model . She says that she never really wanted to pay the price that Hollywood demands for stardom ( " You become everybody 's personal property ' ' ) , but by 1946 she was there , like a thousand others , sitting around on sets , earning little more than the right to join the extras union . She finally landed a meaty role in Champion , with Kirk Douglas and Ruth Roman . The picture , says Lola , " set up Kirk and Ruth . Afterwards . I could n't get a job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV . Champion was playing on Broadway . There was my picture out front-all the reviews said ' Here 's a new star ' - and I could n't even pay my hotel bill . " <P> A Hold at Last . By 1949 Lola was back in Hollywood , still waiting for recognition . She suffered from insomnia , and she was beginning to pick up a reputation as an oddball . " I always liked to do kookie things , " she insists , but now , with two unsuccessful marriages and years of unimportant roles behind her , she feels as if she is taking hold . Peter Gunn gave her steady work ( though she still lives on vitamin shots and fights insomnia ) , and the chance to sing gave her a new career . Today , when she walks her dog around her modest Encino home , lonely Lola is beginning to think that the world looks good . And her tentative joy is reflected in the intimate warmth of her songs . " I never had the remotest idea anybody would ever ask me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I 'm especially grateful for one thing : I do n't sound like anybody else . "
