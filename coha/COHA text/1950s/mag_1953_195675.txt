When Karl Menninger was a reporter on the Topeka Capital , he learned to pack the " who , what , where , when &; how " of a news story lead into a few short , sharp words . Then he became a psychiatrist , like his father and brother William ( TIME , Oct. 25 , 1948 ) , and ever since , he has found himself hearing and talking , reading and writing a jabberwocky jargon which meant different things to different experts and nothing to most laymen . Last week , Psychiatrist Menninger struck a blow for common sense and understandability in the naming of mental illness . <P> At the American Psychiatric Association meetings in Los Angeles , Dr. Menninger suggested that the pseudo-scientific classification of mental illnesses into neuroses ( or psychoneuroses ) and psychoses be dropped , and with it such terms as schizophrenia , catatonia , paranoia and manic-depressive psychosis . To take its place he proposed a simple one-two-three-four grading of mental illnesses according to severity , this to be judged by the degree to which the patient has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The process involved in mental illness , " said Psychiatrist Menninger , " consists of increasing efforts by the patient to keep control of himself . These take changing forms . But there is order even in this disorder . " Theory aside , he had a practical reason for the suggested change : " Four-fifths of the people who have what we have been calling a psychosis or psychoneurosis get well in the better hospitals , where such terms are not used in the patient 's hearing . " <P> Dr. Menninger 's idea did not come to a vote , but he expects to bring it up again soon at a get-together on psychoanalysis in London . <P> In the scientific sessions , where 118 papers were given ( many of them in highly technical trade talk ) , members heard : A report by a University of Washington research team that excessive crying by infants , usually called " three-months ' colic , " is directly traceable to the mother 's behavior . If the mothers are inconsistent in their care , offering food irregularly , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ignoring them , the babies not only cry more but grow more slowly than those who get consistent , considerate care . The story of a young mother with a triple personality . Drs . Corbett H. Thigpen and Hervey M. Cleckley of Augusta , Ga . told of a patient whom they called Eve White who had a second personality , " Eve Black , " and a third known simply as " Jane . " Prim and proper Eve White seemed to be unaware of the existence of Eve Black , but in the Eve Black phase she became coquettish and informal to the point of recklessness . Moreover , Eve in the third person . Sample quote : " When Black knew Eve White , and spoke of her I go out and get a little polluted , she wakes up with the hangover and timidly wonders what in hell 's made her so damned sick . " Jane suddenly appeared during a psychiatric interview . She knows what both Eves can do , and shows promise of doing better in life than either of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
