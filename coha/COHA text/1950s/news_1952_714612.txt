txt SIOUX CITY , Iowa , April ** I cold print today 's flood is tomorrow 's statistic , but at this particular moment in the history of the turbulent and tricky Missouri River the human misery appears almost without end . The weary battle against the " Mighty Mo , " uncoiling its muddy waters over more than a million acres of rich farm land , is written in the faces of thousands of s forced from their homes , in the ; aces of thousands of volunteers and professional flood fighters . But there also is written in these same faces dogged determination as humans win a skirmish here , lose one there , and keep moving forward to stern the huge inundation . If there is a bright spot in the dreary flood picture it is that- the river carries less silt than usual during a floodtide . This will be a boon to , Clean-up work , although river mud and debris poses a major problem after any flood . While this one-time Indian community was winning the last stages of the flood fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A helicopter trip revealed the waters creeping over more farmlands and slowly climbing higher against the earthen barriers protecting several communities along the winding river course . In the area of Council Bluffs , Iowa , and Omaha , Neb. , cities facing each other across the Missouri , more than 6,000 Army , Navy and Coast Guard personnel and Civilians worked to strengthen dikes to prevent what one Army engineer said could be " another Armourdale . " He referred to the havoc inflicted on the Armourdale industrial area of Kansas City , Kan. , last July by the Kansas // FLIGHT OVER FLOOD EMPHASIZES HAVOC // River , a tributary of the Missouri . From the air the whole city of Council Bluffs appeared to be in turmoil . Trucks , automobiles and carts were hauling household goods and humans to safe ground and delivering sandbags and other flood fighting equipment . From tree-top height , what may be the greatest mass evacuation of people in the Missouri Valley 's history appeared helter-skelter at times , but the important point was that there was adequate warning . Residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could manage . As in other communities that already were victims of the river 's tactics , families were moving out not only with personal belongings but also , in some cases , with dismantled furniture and items of household equipment . The helicopter flight gave especial insight into the destructiveness of the flood . The Coast Guard has been operating three ' copters , brought from Elizabeth City , N. C. , Travers City , Mich. , and the Coast Guard Air Station at Brooklyn , N. Y. This reporter flew with Chief W. R. Goldhammer of 152 Margaret Drive , East Meadow , L. I. , New York , and Carl Koch of Sarasota , Fla. , aviation machinist 's mate , second class . Both are from the Brooklyn Air Station . They had been here a week on rescue and supply missions and moved on today for further work downstream . The helicopters operated from a playground in the heart of Sioux City . Heading out over the vast sea of water , the helicopter on today 's survey trip dropped low over three horses on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not move as the craft whirred over . A few miles away three giant dappled gray draft horses occupied another spot of dry land . Farm machinery rusted in the water amid debris carried along by the swirling tide . Here and there farmers still struggled to keep intact dikes that guarded their farmsteads . These were isolated farm islands in the water . The farmers , their sons and other members of their families waved as the helicopter flew over . Here and there livestock roamed up and down mud roads still above the water . Most livestock , however , had been removed from farms in the path of the flood because of the adequate warnings . Several thousand head of livestock in the Sioux City stockyards were removed ahead of the flood . Water today I stood two and three feet deep in most of the yards . Ducks by the hundreds skimmed the muddy waters , leaving water trails like vapor streaks . Automobiles and other vehicles stood isolated on high ground in the farm country to which they had been moved . Patches of snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange mixture with water along the edges of fields . In many places it was difficult to tell where the original river channel began and farm fields left off . Water still lapped at the edges of field embankments , cutting off more and more rich soil . The full force of the flood was seen in the towns and hamlets up and down the river . Riverside , a northern section of Sioux City , was almost completely under water . It was caught by the Big Sioux River , itself flooding and backing up from its confluence with the Missouri . Just the tops of some houses stuck out of the water . A few were off their foundations . The Iowa Power and Light Company plant on the Big Sioux was still in operation . The swimming pool at Riverview Amusement Park appeared to have dirtier water than the Missouri River itself . Dike Has ** " Freeboard " , A levee twenty-three miles long protects Council Bluffs and an area below that city , although only fifteen miles of the dike holds back the water at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in height . It was designed to hold back 26.6 feet of flood water , with an additional five feet of freeboard or safe margin on top . The dike also was designed to curb a flow of 250,000 cubic feet per second , but the river was flowing at a rate of 275.000 second feet today and at least 400,000 second feet was expected by crest time Thursday . " That levee just was n't designed to resist the scour ( or wash ) coming at this time , " an engineer said . While downstream communities braced for the coming flood force , here in Sioux City workers toiled on to hold what could still be saved from the river . Downtown Sioux City was untouched by the flood except for seepage and backed-up sewers . The major inundation was in a relatively small area along the low-lying river front . The most critical point still was South Sioux City , across what South Sioux City , on the Nebraska side of the river across what now has become a lake . Half of the town is covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the other half has water of varying depths . Evacuation headquarters , the high school , has water on three sides from backedup sewers . City Hall is surrounded by water , but is being kept dry by pumps , whose chug-chugs can be heard throughout the stricken area . Several hundred men still , worked on the earthen dike , which is continuously being reinforced , along Fourth Avenue . It runs north and south and affords protection to the one major " dry " spot in the town . It was here that Dean Daniels , supervising the dike work , told of " doctors coming over to get on the end of a shovel along with laymen whose numbers include bus line superintendents , butchers and bakers , grocery clerks and day laborers . " " We have n't whipped it yet and there 's one more round , tonight , to go , " he said . " Funny thing , we usually get more chiefs than Indians , everyone wants to be a chief , but this time that 's not true . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proved the merit of a planned disaster committee in the present fight . The committee was set up two years ago after a disastrous packing plant explosion . Its chief is the inspector-instructor of the United States Naval Reserve Training Center here , although its fountainhead is the American Red Cross , Woodbury County Chapter . The committee includes the mayor , safety commissioner , health officer and chief of police . Many ' Red Cross workers aid it as volunteers . From the training station 's " nerve center , " Lieut . Comdr . S. C. Kivett of Indianapolis , inspector-instructor of the Naval Reserve Center , acted as executive coordinator of the routing of workers , personnel , supplies , boat crews . The committee saw to it that , as the flood warnings were issued , adequate food supplies were set aside . It provided for radio communications and for floodlights for night time operations . From one floor of the " nerve center , " the Coast Guard , under Lieut . L , S. Sandler of Omaha , kept in constant communication with mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the flood crest moved downstream the Coast Guard started to move equipment , including boats , to new danger points . Red Cross workers toiled around-the-clock here to provide adequate food , medical and health care for flood victims . Some 270 refugees were housed in the Sioux City High School gymnasium and were being fed by workers from the First Christian Church , the First Congregational Church , the Trinity Lutheran Church and the Mt . Sinai Temple . Easter Dinner in Synagogue An Easter Sunday dinner was served in the synagogue . Youngest of the evacuees at Central High School here was eightday-old Vicki Parker , daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Tom Parker , who were forced from their home on River Drive . Like most flood victimes they were stolid in their plight . " Sure , we 'll go back if there 's anything to go back to , " they said . Such statements are an old story along the Missouri . In Trinity Lutheran Church an elderly man clutched a silver cross dangling from a chain around his neck and murmured a prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforted his 5-year-old daughter and sought to get her to drink a cup of orange juice . Two bright , tow-headed youngsters in overalls put away man-sized portions of scrambled eggs . In a corner a radio broadcast flood news and personal messages . Said the announcer : " Levi Olson wants John Patterson to know that his hogs are okay in the barn . Mrs. Kitchener can take care of a couple with a child and cooking is permissible . Get in touch with the Red Cross . " " The Lowells have a studio couch and baby buggy in the basement . The Freeburgers have a five-room house and can feed a couple , but they must bring their own bed . " In Sioux City and in South Sioux City , as in other flood areas , the Salvation Army is helping to feed relief workers and flood refugees . A woman at Bridgeport , Conn. , called the Red Cross to inquire about relatives . " I thought the whole town was under water , " she said after being told that most of the town lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers of housing and other assistance poured in . The flood came from the rapid melt of snow on nearly 80,000 square miles in the upper Missouri Valley . This snow fell on a virtual icecap beneath which the ground was frozen . That made for rapid run-off , but caused little of the land wash which contributes to heavy river silting . The , Missouri , thus , is carrying mostly sand and characteristic valley sediment .
