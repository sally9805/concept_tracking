Dear TIME-Reader : <P> <P> AS Europe turns a corner in its post-war history , what does its youth think of the future ? To find out what the younger generation of the Continent 's most articulate country thinks , TIME 'S editors sent Correspondent Stanley Karnow ranging from Paris up and down France . Karnow talked with young people of all kinds : Communists , Socialists , Catholics , city boys , country boys , students , workers and peasants . And he talked to them in their own language . <P> Brooklyn-born Karnow set sail for Europe aboard a coal freighter a week after his graduation from Harvard in 1947 . Since then , he has returned to the U.S. only for short visits . Karnow studied French at the Sorbonne and European politics at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris . Afterwards he did welfare work and freelance writing before he joined TIME 'S Paris Bureau in 1951 . A U.S. expatriate who loves France , Karnow listened , week after week , as young Frenchmen and Frenchwomen indicted not only their elders but their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recorded his impressions for this week 's special report on France : The Younger Generation . <P> <P> AS he finished editing Carl Solberg 's fine takeout on the late great Welsh Poet DYLAN THOMAS ( see BOOKS ) , Senior Editor Henry Anatole Grunwald recalled a small chapter of the Thomas legend : once the poet had wanted to write for TIME . In 1945 Thomas asked U.S. Poet-Critic OSCAR WILLIAMS : " Could you approach TIME - whom you suggested as possible employers - and get some definite promise , however small , from them ? " Unfortunately , Thomas postponed his trip to America five years and never came to TIME . <P> SINCE he took up trompe-l'oeil ( fool - the - eye ) painting ( TIME , Dec . <P> 6 ) , Artist AARON BOHROD , who painted this week 's cover picture of GOVERNOR GOODWIN J. <P> KNIGHT , has sometimes used small self-portraits as part of his signature . <P> On the California redwood background of the Knight cover , Bohrod painted his incised signature under another tiny self-portrait . Said he , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face on the cover of TIME , so I sneaked it in through the back door . " Cordially yours ,
