Every other summer for twelve years the Communists have served up a monster propaganda rally for fellow travelers of the younger set from all over the world , and for any other ingenuous souls who could be enticed along . Until this year , the circuses were always staged behind the Iron Curtain , with plenty of Red police to keep things moving by the numbers , and press censorship to blank out any slipups . But last week , when the pink pipes of Pan sounded for the Seventh Youth Festival in neutral Vienna 's vast Prater fairgrounds , there was trouble , trouble everywhere . <P> With the bulk of the 17,000 delegates coming from the Soviet bloc-many having their first look outside the Iron Curtain-the festival organizers did their best to make them feel that they had never left home . The Bulgarian , Czech , Hungarian and Rumanian delegates were quartered in tent cities five miles from Vienna , closely guarded by other " delegates , " and whisked back and forth each day in buses , some of them with Moscow license plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mishmash of the devout ( including Paul Robeson Jr. ) , the trusting , and the curious . There was also a cadre of professionally coached antiCommunists , including a young American scientist , J. A. Ransahoff , who at a party-line seminar on the atom stole the Red thunder with a facts-and-figures presentation of the U.S. program for the peaceful uses of atomic energy . <P> But when the young non-Communists -a majority of the U.S. delegation-tried to win representation on the festival steering committee , they got a lesson in Communist procedural manipulation . On the transparent pretext that a number of registration cards had been stolen , Festival Chairman ( and French Communist ) Jean Garcias flatly refused to recognize the majority 's officers . <P> Surprise Signs . A few of the Americans joined with other anti-Communists in Vienna to undercut the festival in a variety of ways . Free bus trips to view the barbed-wire border of Hungary were organized . Light planes circled over Vienna drawing streamers that said " Remember Hungary , " " Remember Tibet . " The brother of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtain delegates , and U.S. Songstress Ella Fitzgerald was brought in to sing at the other side of town at the same time as Red-banked Baritone Paul Robeson Sr. was Old Man Rivering at a festival rally . All week long , Americans slipped anti-Communist literature under the dinner places and into the beds of Iron Curtain delegates , or handed it out openly in the Prater . For their pains , at least nine-four of them girls-were roughed up by Communist guards , and an acid bomb was thrown into the publishing house printing the anti-Communist tracts .
