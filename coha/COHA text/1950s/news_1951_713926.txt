txt General of the Army Douglas charged tonight that there was a campaign under way in the United States to " pervert the truth , " create fear and confuse the American people . He declared the campaign was being waged by " insidious forces " spreading false propaganda of America 's weakness and by those who " seek to make all men servants of the state . " In an apparent reference to his I own ouster as Far Eastern Corn-1 mander because he had spoken out against President Truman 's Korean war program , the general said : " There are those who seek to prevent men from fearlessly speaking their minds according to the dictates of their conscience . " The five-star general spoke to a crowd officially estimated at 20,000  --  but there were some who thought the total was much lower . Vast expanses of the huge Rice Institute Stadium , where the general spoke , were barren . The general talked for only fourteen minutes , standing on a covered platform at the east end of the stadium . The platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank of microphones . While the crowd was small , it was a noisy one and frequently interrupted the general with bursts of applause . City officials had expected up to 70,000 persons to jam the stadium and there was no immediate explanation why the turnout was comparatively so small . Dark clouds that rose out of the west holding the threat of rain might have been one reason . Tomorrow General goes to San Antonio for the third speech of his Texas tour , which he opened yesterday in Austin . There he accused Administration policy makers of appeasement in Korea and of a moral decay that is causing the American people to ? lose Earl . Tonight 's speech was not as hard hitting as the Austin blast . The general again did not identify those he accused of spreading " false propaganda " throughout the country . General said a feel- , ing of fear was being generated throughout the nation " by the constant but false propaganda that we are weak  --  that we are not prepared to defend ourselves against any who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surer ? incitation to attack " the United States than the lack of confidence Americans show in themselves . " He said this " propaganda " is that " we must appease and compromise to encourage others to desist from attacking . " Then he added : " It is not from threat of external attack that we have reason to fear . It is from those insidious forces working from within . " It is they that create the basis for fear by spreading false propaganda designed to destroy those moral precepts to which we have clung for direction since the immutable declaration of our independence became the great charter of our liberty . " He said this " campaign to pervert the truth and shape and confuse the public mind with its consequent weakening of moral courage " can not be charged entirely to Communists . " For they have many allies , " he said , " here , as elsewhere , who , blind to reality , ardently support the general Communist aims while reacting violently to the mere suggestion that they do so . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means to gain or " entrench power . " He added : " There are those who , believing themselves liberals , chart a course which can but lead to destruction . " As General and his party arrived at the stadium a 105-mm. howitzer battery of a Texas National Guard artillery unit boomed out a seventeen-gun salute . The general 's address capped a full day of activity . He visited the Veterans Administration Hospital here and chatted with veterans of World War I and II . Among them were veterans of the Leyte landing in the Philippines and the First Cavalry Division , which participated in Pacific campaigns . In front of the Shamrock Hotel , where the general and his party stayed during the Houston visit , General received the keys to a $6,400 black Cadillac this ' morning , a gift of the Elks Club of Houston . He and his son received gold deputy sheriffs ' badges from the Harris County Sheriff . During the afternoon the general 's party drove to Galveston , where there was a short parade in his honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the San Jacinto battleground , about twenty-five nines from Houston . General laid a wreath at the base of the 570-foot San Jacinto monument , which marks the spot where the Republic of Texas won its ) 11-dependence from Mexico . General was to leave Houston Friday morning for San Antonio .
