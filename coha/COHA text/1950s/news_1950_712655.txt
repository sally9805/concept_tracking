SIMPSON.ELEAN ... pg . 20 Letters to The Times Mr. McCloy 's Speech Status of War Criminals Discussed in Democratizing of Germany To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORIC Taos : The address of High Commissioner McCloy delivered at the opening of the New Amerika Haus in Stuttgart is a forthright statement of the determination of the Allies to stem the rising tide of nationalism , militarism and antiSemitism in Germany while offering to the German people the fullest cooperation of the Western powers in building a genuine democratic state . It is hoped that Mr. McCloy 's " straight-fromAheshoulder " talk will be implemented by effective measures which the Western powers are permitted to invoke under the Occupation Statute . I note an important omission in Mr. McCloy 's statement  --  namely , the necessity for the punishment of war criminals as an important factor in making possible the development of a democratic Germany . For , as THE NEW YORK TIMES correctly pointed out in its editorial of Feb. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of crimes against humanity must have " a reassuring effect on Nazi front organizations while weakening the hand of our democratic friends , not least of all in Germany . " In this connection , may I draw attention to the report in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Feb. 3 concerning the reduction of the sentence of Baron Ernst von Weiszaecker , German State Secretary under Hitler , who received a seven-year prison sentence for having plotted aggressive war and for having committed atrocities against civilian populations . Weiszaecker was convicted of having been an essential mover in the " terrorism , kidnapping , blackmail and murder " which led to the destruction of the Czechoslovak Republic and for having been involved in and having officially approved of the deportation of six thousand Jewish children , women and aged men from France to Auschwitz . Can anyone honestly take the view that tie clemency shown in Weiszaecker 's case will not have " a reassuring effect " on those , groups who must be purged if , in the words of Mr. McCloy , " the German people hope again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? We trust that Mr. McCloy 's speech , which we should like to believe expressed the official Washington view , means that the findings and sentences of the Nuremberg tribunals will be sustained in other cases pending before the Commission . The sentences of such criminals as Oswald Pohl , who , working directly under Himmler , was the administrative head of Hitler 's concentration camps , and Otto Ohlendorf , chief of the S. S. Einsatzgruppen , special extermination units responsible for the murder of over one million civilians , must be carried out . This hope does not stem from any desire for revenge , but rather because firmness in these cases will offer concrete evidence that Mr. McCloy does not intend to weaken " the hand of our democratic friends " and those who understand that a democratic Germany is essential for the preservation of world peace . ROBERT S. MARCUS , Political Director , World Jewish Congress . New York , Feb. 7 , 1950 . German School Defended TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As another alumnus of the " Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take issue with certain statements made by George L. Mosse in a letter that appeared in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Jan. 28 . Salem was founded for the purpose of taking students of all backgrounds . In order to achieve this aim , a sliding scale of tuition fees was established and a large number of scholarships were granted . Theses latter were given on the basis of merit and not , as Mr. Mosse states , on the basis of birth . Salem students came from all walks of life . Mr. Mosse objects to " the stress " on athletic activities . The German school system , as a whole , emphasized factual and theoretical knowledge only . Salem , on the other hand , gave its students an opportunity to develop a complete personality . The regular school courses were the same as in other schools , as all students , whatever their school , had to pass the same final examinations . But , in addition , Salem also gave its students an opportunity for physical development through sport as well as agricultural and mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Salem students were intended to leave school , not , as Mr. Mosse states , an elite born to rule but ' as a group of boys and girls equipped to become good citizens . BEATRIX CZERNIN . Lakeville , Conn. , Jan. 31 , 1950 . New York 's Status on Butter-Making To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The striking fact that New York dairymen would suffer little from the competition of colored oleomargarine is brought to focus by your Feb. 3 editorial " Butter Forever 14 to 0 . " In this you outline the action of the Assembly Agriculture Committee in killing all bills , without hearings , to lift the state 's ban on colored margarine sales . Fact is , that New York is no longer an important butter-making state . Its creamery output of less than 15 million pounds stands in nineteenth place in the nation . By contrast , Minnesota leads with 222,657,000 , 18.4 per cent of the country 's make ( in 1948 ) ; Iowa , 187,885,000 , 15.5 per cent ; Wisconsin , 99,992,000 , 8.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus this fourstate group makes 48.6 per cent of the nation 's butter , much of which is shipped to Eastern markets . New York does stand second in milk yield , over 8 billion pounds , exceeded only by Wisconsin 's nearly 15 billion . Minnesota is third , nearly billion , Iowa fourth , nearly 6 billion . The reason for the decline in butter-making is simple and economically sound . It ix more profitable to sell the fluid milk and cream , as is , than to manufacture it into butter or cheese . The Mid . western states do not have the immense market for market milk that New York enjoys ; so they manufacture products of the dairy cow that can be stored and shipped . It is the Midwestern dairyman , therefore , who fears most the competition of margarines selling just now for about one-half the price of fine creamery butter , with the makers improving the flavor and aualitv . CHARLES F. Cormssorf , Former Farm Editor , Minneapolis Tribune . Tuckahoe , N. Y. , Feb. 6 , 1950 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The New York State Disability Law is far from being the paragon of social legislation which it has been cracked up to be . It has been the recipient of a publicity which has blown it up to proArtions far beyond its very modest contribution to the welfare of New York employes . Let us analyze the law as it will af-. fect most workers . The employer takes out a group policy insuring against loss of wages due to sickness , in a minimum amount prescribed by the statute . As stated by Governor Dewey in his speech to the Legislature last year , the contribution of the employer to the cost of the policy *ill about equal the contribution of the employe ; in other words , about $15 per year per employe . If employes voluntarily got together to take out group insurance in the amount prescribed by the statute , it would cost each employe about $30 per year . All that the statute does is to make such insurance compulsory , and to make the employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no employe needs to stage a celebration when he gets a raise of $15 per year . Yet , as far as legal benefit is concerned , $15 per year is all that he actually gets from this statute . The maximum that a worker gets from the type of policy prescribed in the statute is $338 in a benefit year . It would require , of course , a very serious illness to provide this not exorbitant amount ( at least fourteen weeks of disability ) . A real social insurance statute would require the employer to take the very slight risk involved entirely upon his own shoulders , without contribution from the employe . As we have seen , this would amount to an extra expense to the employer of only about $30 per year per employe . It is further submitted that there is no reason to require the employer to go to the extra expense of taking out insurance . ' The amount involved is so small that any employer of a going business can be trusted to handle this additional responsibility as he would be responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently protected by giving him the same statutory protections for these payments as he gets for payments of his wages . In the event of a contested claim the employer could be required to post payments with the state board which handles . claims . But the purpose of this letter is not to criticize the statute as such . It is rather to criticize the undue praise that has been heaped upon what is really only a modicum of benefit to our workers . LEONARD P. SIMPSON . New York , Feb. 2 , 1950 . Attack on Hamilton Regretted To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Referring to the 194th birthday celebration of Aaron Burr by the Aaron Burr Association , may I say that while they hailed Aaron Burr 's merits as a patriot , statesman and ' one of outstanding mental qualities the association showed a deplorable lack of fairness by denouncing Hamilton as a scoundrel . Both Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton worked with their best abilities during and after the Revolution to establish this young country . Hamilton was a genius , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton committed errors , was Aaron Burr free of any ? Were it not more to the credit of the Burr Association , if they could not justly evaluate Hamilton 's greatness side by side with Aaron Burr 's , at least to refrain from denunciations ? Hamilton 's death through the hand of Aaron Burr was unfortunate ; that Aaron Burr suffered through it , is still no cause for calling Hamilton names . ELEANOR MAKROCZY . New Rochelle , N. Y. , Feb. 6 , 1950 . Business Women Over 35 To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : " Disgusted " in his letter of Jan. 27 to your paper " has come to the conclusion that one of the greatest sins any man in America can commit is that of living to be over 40 . " It seems that an even greater error is committed by the American business woman who not only dares to live to be over 35 but actually , mind you , has the audacity to assume that her background of study and experience , plus excellent references , might possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her advanced age . Being a native New Yorker , and having an odd affection for the sea-breezes and sunshine of my old home town ; I recently returned to it , believing it might still be the " city of opportunity ? even for daring souls past 35 . However , after a number of interviews , which pleasantly but firmly stressed the " age limit , " and careful scanning of advertisements for " Help Wanted17-23 , under 27 , etc. , etc. , " I realize that I must conserve my small resources for an unconvinced retirement .
