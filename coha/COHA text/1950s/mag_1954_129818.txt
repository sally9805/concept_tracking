In the unlikeliest of classrooms , the front office of a major league club , Martin Whiteford Marion learned last week that honesty is the best policy . It is one copybook maxim he can put in the bank and draw checks against . // The moving van which hauled the St. Louis Browns ' franchise and duffle to Baltimore last winter also carried a contract calling for Marty Marion to manage the team at least one more season . First order of business was a conference between Marion and Arthur H. Ehlers , hired down from Philadelphia to be general manager . // " It is a dreadful ball club , " said Marion , who had the quaint notion that his new boss wanted an honest opinion . // Ehlers was aghast . He had thought all along that it was an aggregation of supermen that had run 46 ? games behind the Yankees in 1953 . Marion sought to console him . // " Although they are very poor hitters , " he said , borrowing freely from Ring Lardner , " they are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried , and ushered Marion to an outbound bus . // Puzzled , Marion consulted books left over from his year at Georgia Tech . " Honesty 's the best policy , " wrote Miguel de Cervantes . " I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs , " said George Washington in his farewell address . // " Always ? " Marion wondered , and went and got a job as coach with the Chicago White Sox . Meanwhile Ford Frick advised Baltimore that Marion 's salary must be paid in full . // A TRANQUIL SUMMER // Marion had a tranquil summer . He drew a manager 's salary from Baltimore . He drew a coach 's wage from Chicago . No longer an active player , he suffered not at all from his undisciplined sacroiliac or his damaged knee or the defeatist attitude which had made him , when he was playing for the Cards , the best shortstop and one of the most resolute competitors of his time . // Summer waned and Paul Richards , manager of the White Sox over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole show for the next three years . This created a vacancy with the White Sox , whose ownership decided that the brand of defeatism unacceptable in Baltimore was plenty good enough for Chicago . // Next year , Marion will draw a manager 's salary in Comiskey Park . // What of Baltimore , where Jimmy Dykes , fired rudely by the Athletics , had succeeded Marion ? When he took the job , Dykes gave it as his considered opinion that the transplanted Browns required only a bit of pitching here and there to become pennant contenders . // A ROUSING RACE // In 37 baseball seasons , Dykes earned a reputation for fearless candor . There are men whose admiration for Jimmy was not heightened by this kow-towing to the Ehlers party line with its implied slur on Marion 's spirit . // Purged of defeatism , Baltimore put up a rousing race with the Athletics for last place . At season 's end next Sunday , the Orioles will be 55 or 60 games behind the winning Indians . // Richards took over Ehlers ' job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men might remain with the organization in positions of lesser authority . // Waiting to collect their share of the third-place money the White Sox have won , Marion and Phil Cavarretta have time for long talks together . Cavarretta was manager of the Cubs until last spring when the owner , Phil K. Wrigley , asked him about the team . // Like Marion , Cavarretta answered honestly : the team smelled . He , too , got fired , winding up as a part-time player with the White Sox . // Says Cavarretta to Marion : " Well , I see where the Cubs are finishing seventh . " // Says Marion to Cavarretta : " Truth , crushed to earth , shall rise again . I read that somewhere , Phil . "
