Herbert J. Idle is a wiry , nervous man whose name is anything but apt . In the daytime he is a $410-a-month hydraulic engineer with Chicago 's Water Distribution Division . But at night he turns into quite another person . He likes to read dictionaries , goes into ecstasies over the fact that eyen was once the plural of eye and that withy was once a halter . He also composes music , reads through each issue of the National Geographic at least " half a dozen times before it goes into my files . " But most of all , Herbert Idle likes to solve puzzles . " It is , " says he , " a sort of disease with me . " <P> Over the years , Idle has entered scores of contests . In 1937 he tried for the Old Gold contest , got only a carton of cigarettes for his pains . Later he won a pair of skis , and finally , in 1951 , he won $2,000 in Chicago 's street-naming contest sponsored by the Sun-Times . But by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Chicago paper by Manhattan 's Unicorn Press , distributors of the New Funk &; Wagnalls Encyclopedia . Said the ad : " YOU CAN WIN $102,500 ! ! ! " <P> Herbert Idle got his first puzzles in 1950-a set of questions and rebuses that seemed like duck soup . It took him almost no time at all to answer the questions ( e.g. , " John Alden , one of our Pilgrim Fathers , courted : 1 ) Jane Addams , 2 ) Betsy Ross , 3 ) Barbara Frietchie , 4 ) Pocahontas , 5 ) Priscilla Mullins " ) . Nor did he have much trouble solving the rebuses . Idle worked with care , and as the months went by and more &; more rebuses came , his living room began to overflow with dictionaries , reference books and the encyclopedia , which he had to buy volume by volume . Eventually Idle was informed that if he wanted to invest in the encyclopedia 's yearbooks , he would be eligible for more money . Plagued by his old disease , Herbert Idle persevered-until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Unicorn Press . Sample rebus ( answer is the last name of a German composer ) : <P> <P> Last week Herbert Idle , 55 , was summoned to Manhattan , told only that he was one of the first three top winners . Finally , on the big day , at a special ceremony on the Sub-Treasury steps , former Vice President Alben Barkley announced the grand prize . Knees shaking , Herbert Idle stumbled up to the Veep , accepted a check for $307,500-the largest cash prize ever given in a contest . Would he now throw away his dictionaries and go off on a big , glorious toot with the estimated $72,245 he would have after taxes ? No such thing , said Herbert Idle , father of four , grandfather of six . " That would n't be intelligent . I showed a certain amount of common sense in this contest , and that would be out of character . "
