SARATOGA , once the gaudiest of American spas , is also one of the oldest . Its history goes back all the way to the Indians . In fact the first white man to visit the springs ( in August 1767 ) , Sir William Johnson , who was the British superintendent of Indian affairs , was permitted to visit them only because he was popular among the Indians , who called him the " Great White Father " ? a title which he did his best to maintain by siring , through a succession of Indian mistresses , no less than a hundred children . Saratoga 's own name is also of Indian origin . It is derived from the Iroquois word Se-rach-to-que . Unhappily the word was , until ten years ago , translated by an official publication of New York State as " Floating Scum upon the Water . " To Saratogians ? they are never called just Saratogans ? who have had a good deal to put up with in these modern times , the translation was the last straw , and they finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So today the word is translated , more satisfactorily , " Hillside Country of a Great River . " The only difficulty with this translation is that Saratoga is not on a hill and is not by a river ; in fact it can honestly lay no claim to being a beauty spot at all . Saratoga has its famous Saratoga Lake , which was in the old days a center of intercollegiate rowing , but this is the only body of water anywhere around , and while the mountains may be seen from certain vantage points the land generally is flat and there is no scenic splendor as at Bar Harbor . The contrasting charms of Newport , with its Colonial downtown and its cottage-castle uptown , or of Palm Beach with its Mizner palazzos mixed with modern Fifth Avenue stores , are missing . Saratoga has contrasts , all right , but they are not- necessarily charming ones . The railroad tracks still cross Saratoga 's main street , its famous Broadway , and , although the train passengers no longer hang out the windows to see the Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is still in places a handsome tree-lined sight . At the same time , Broadway , and indeed Saratoga in general , in many other places , is a crowded jumble of honky-tonk hotels and motels , roadhouses and boarding-houses . The town has , in fact , no industry except health  | and recreation , although it offers for variety its Skidmore College , where over a thousand girls come from all parts of the country . and its Yaddo Park , where , as at the MacDowell Colony in Peterboro , New Hampshire , real live authors and artists may be seen in what their patrons apparently believe are their natural habitats . Its chief asset is , of course , the fact that it has , on the one hand , the country 's oldest continuously operating race track ? at least except during World War II ? and on the other , the country 's most modern spa development ? the $10,000,000 Saratoga Spa Association . Here there are three bathhouses , the Lincoln , Washington , and Roosevelt ( F.D. ) ; a " Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Geyser , Hathorn , and Coesa ; the Gideon Putnam Hotel , which is named for Saratoga 's first hotelbuilder ; and a Research Institute and all manner of recreational facilities , including a therapeutic golf course where no grade runs steeper than 5 per cent . SARATOGA is famous for its trunk and its chip . Iron-bound and , to the despair of porters , curved on top , the Saratoga trunk spread the spa 's name far and wide a century ago ; it took two strong men to lift , and held a month 's changes even for the clothes-horse belles of those by-gone years . Almost equally renowned was the Saratoga chip . First served almost exactly one hundred years ago , at Moon 's Lake House in 1853 , the development of the chip was the result of a cook 's outburst of temper . The cook of the old Moon 's was an irascible half-breed named George Crum , the son of a mulatto jockey and an Indian woman . No man to trifle with , he had no less than five wives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of whom served as waitresses in his establishment . When a fastidious diner sent back Crum 's French-fried potatoes with the comment that he wished them sliced thinner , Crum was furious . He shaved off some potato slices paper-thin , wrapped them in a napkin , and plunged it into a tub of ice water . Then , after he had kept the diner waiting for a full half hour , he first dropped the chilled slices into a kettle of boiling grease , then ladled them out and salted them , and , finally , more or less as a practical joke , sent them in by one of his wife-waitresses . Instead of showing the indigna ? ion Crum expected , the diner promptly called for more . Then and there the Saratoga chip was born . Moon 's immediately saw in the discovery an excellent thirst producer , one well calculated to increase liquor consumption , and that very day distributed the chips free to patrons in paper cornucopias . By the next day chips were placed in a huge bowl on the bar with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took more than the Tuxedo coat and the Palm Beach suit to make those resorts , however , so it took more than a trunk and a potato chip to make Saratoga . But two other items sufficed . One was the growth of gambling ; the other was the growth of the grand hotel . " Elegant hells " were what Saratoga 's gambling casinos were called in their great days ? and , poetically enough , the grand hotels were primarily famous for their " elegant belles . " Today , of course , the sad state of both the hells and the belles , Saratoga 's two great recreational commodities , are responsible for the sad fact that no great resort is more of a shadow of its former social self than Saratoga . GAMBLING-except for the pari-mutuel flat racing and excellent night harness racing ? is now as dead at Saratoga as it is anywhere else east of Nevada . A guard at Canfield 's famous old red Club House , which has ever since 1911 been a part of Canfield Park , expresses it briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . And a recent visitor to what was once the most elegant of all Saratoga 's " elegant hells " was amazed to find it sheltering a thriving convention of ? of all people ? Jehovah 's Witnesses . No less extraordinary has been the passing of Saratoga 's great nineteenth-century hostelries , the first of which was built in 1802 . Today only one remains . This one building , the Grand Union Hotel , which was not built but rebuilt in 1864 ? parts of it go back to 1836 ? still gives Saratoga 's Broadway what nineteenth-century atmosphere remains at the resort . But the Grand Union 's esteemed contemporary , the United States Hotel , was a world War II casualty . Just when death will come to the Grand Union , as it must to all grand hotels , no one knows , though recent news dispatches suggest that the end is imminent . But one thing is  | certain ; the handwriting is on the wall . In fact the handwriting may be said to be literally on the wall because , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's basement has been advertising the fact that the last of Saratoga 's caravansaries has now gone into its own antique business . " Original antiques for sale , " the sign reads . " Period furniture used at the time of Lillian Russell , Diamond Jim Brady , Otis Skinner , Victor Herbert , John Drew , A. T. Stewart . " The last attempt to save the Union appears to have faded with the recent attempt of Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney to buy the hotel and make it some kind of permanent Saratoga memorial . When Whitney 's offer was met by such a staggering increase in-the asking price that even he could not meet it , old Saratogians , bitterly discouraged , all but gave up hope . Only in the month of August is the Grand Union open at all , and even at that time it is only partly open . The 306-foot-long Main Dining Hall , where the gourmets of yesterday did battle , thrice daily , with the groaning board , is now for the first time closed even in August , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Saratoga will be without any grand hotels at all . This is a pity . For the Grand Union is perhaps the most nostalgic , and certainly the most massive , relic of the Good Old Days of resorts . Its white-elephantine splendor is actually enhanced by its grotesque gingerbread architecture , and it still boasts , from Ballroom to Band Stand , the longest single porch in the world ? just over a quarter of a mile . Inside , many of its features date back to Civil War days , including black walnut staircases , mahogany bedroom suites , massive imported French mirrors , Irish hand-pointed needlework draperies , and Waterford cut crystal chandeliers adorning hand-frescoed ceilings . The Bar Room , with its original solid mahogany bar , remains today just as it did when General Grant bent an elbow there . and the hotel elevators , among the first ever installed by the brothers Otis , are still operated by the same steam engine which first operated them in 1875 . The amount of marble in the hotel would cover a solid acre ; the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sights still to be seen in this last stand of the nineteenth century , none is more awe-inspiring than the so-called " Grand Centennial Painting . " This work , which is actually entitled " The Genius of America . hangs in the Main Ballroom . One of the largest paintings in the world , it was commissioned in 1870 from the French artist , Yvon. by A. T. Stewart , the dry-goods merchant , to ornament his New York house . Finding , when the painting was finished , that he could not even get it into his house , let alone hang it there , Stewart promptly shipped it up to the Grand Union ? a hotel which he had bought in 1872 in an attempt to realize his ambition  | to own " the largest hotel in the world . " Today this Grand Centennial Painting , which ever since 1876 has covered , from floor to ceiling , the entire west wall of the Union ballroom , is valued at a sum considerably in excess of the crumbling hotel around it , and no visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painting itself but also of the description of its allegory . According to a recent brochure of the hotel the painting " depicts America , represented by a beautiful woman of Amazonian stature and proportions , dispensing from a huge ' Horn of Plenty ' learning , culture , healing , and largesse generally , to the assembled nations of the world . " II JAMES GORDON BENNETT once called Saratoga the " seraglio of the prurient aristocracy . " Translating " seraglio " as harem and " prurient " as lewd , the description was not a flattering one . Nor can it be denied that in Saratoga 's great days its houses of ill fame were not inconspicuous . Madam Grace Sinclair and Madam Landry , and later Hattie Adams , were by no means backward about exhibiting their wares , and no coaching parade to the lake , race track , or Club House was complete without the sight of their girls , sitting complete with picture-hats and parasols , like a carefully thought-out flower arrangement , on top of handsomely appointed coaches . Despite Mr. Bennett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eighteeneighties and - nineties , extremely circumspect about the registration of the male and female without benefit of marital vows . There were , of course , exceptions . At the United States Hotel one day , the resort sport Evander Berry Wall , King of the Dudes , signed in with his manservant . " Wall and Valet , " he wrote . Wall was followed by the millionaire horsebreeder " White Hat " McCarty and a young lady friend . McCarty looked at the Wall signature and then at his lady friend , then seized the pen . " McCarty , " he wrote , " and Valise . " Mr. McCarty , whose brother still lives in Saratoga as a handicapper , was admitted , but such instances were rare . Furthermore , the hotels maintained a strict girl curfew . ' When the old-time Saratogian staggered up the steps to the so-called " Millionaires ' Piazza " of the old States , or to the Grand Union , he was by no means a free man . After eleven o'clock every entrance of the States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even this was guarded by a husky attendant . The latter not only refused to admit any unregistered ladies but also maintained a corps of assistants who all night long patrolled the lengthy piazzas against any attempt at female bootlegging . Such severity was , of course , responsible for the immediate social popularity of the adjoining hotel cottages . In these cottages no such conventions were applied . " In accordance , " said Saratoga 's late Hugh Bradley , " with the still-prevalent American belief that sin becomes somehow sanctified if a sitting-room is attached to the bedchamber , the cottages solved the problems of numerous lonesome Wall Street tycoons and Western copper kings . " One oil millionaire is still remembered as being so occupied with business that he was forced to share his cottage with no less than five secretaries ; and the number of beautiful but obscure nieces who took up cottage-keeping for their uncles was extraordinary . THE gaiety of Saratoga was enhanced by the combination of social celebrities with stage celebrities . Until the first world war there was at other resorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newport 's Mrs. Fish failed to break it down completely . " You must remember , " said Berry Wall , who spoke for the Newport-Tuxedo circuit , " that Broadway only cuts across Fifth Avenue ; it never parallels it . " Saratoga 's Broadway did parallel it . What Harry Lehr and Mrs. Fish were to Newport , Diamond Jim Brady and Lillian Russell were , in their way , to Saratoga , and while neither that welltraveled salesman nor " that woman , " as oldtime Saratogians still recall her , would have attempted setting up cottage-keeping at Newport , they were , at Saratoga , the uncrowned rulers of the Spa . Of all the flashy characters on the Saratoga scene in the nineties , Diamond Jim was the flashiest . He had thirty complete sets of jewels , one for each day in the month , and each set included a watch , watch chain , ring , scarf pin , necktie pin , necktie clasp , pen  | and pencil , cuff-links , belt buckle , eyeglass case , pocketbook clasp , and J.B.B. monogram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five vest buttons , and even underwear buttons . ' The most ornate of all his sets was his socalled " Transportation Set . " One shirt stud had a bicycle made of 119 diamonds ; the eyeglass case was a locomotive of 210 diamonds . No less than 2,548 diamonds were included in the whole set . Even on the rare occasions when Brady arrived in Saratoga without Lillian Russell , he made up for the lack in style . In the summer of 1896 he arrived with a silver-plated railroad undertruck , Miss Russell 's gold-plated bicycle , and twenty-seven Japanese houseboys . One of these boys acquired so many fifty-cent Havana cigars that after Brady returned to New York he opened a cigar store . For her part the great Miss Russell was equally conspicuous . If Brady had his Japanese houseboys , Miss Russell had a famous Japanese spaniel , complete with an $1,800 collar , and when her gold-plated bicycle bored her she had a carriage with solid silver trimmings and dazzling white doeskin reins . Each summer Miss Russell rented a cottage and brought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farm Flirts " she called them ? to entertain the menfolk . Fighting a constantly losing battle with her waistline , she insisted on all her guests exercising severely each day ; then each night she would seize the bedpost while the maid , who often neglected to pull down the shades , would seize her corset strings and try to get her mistress in shape for dinner . A companion period-piece was the celebrated English sportsman Squire Abingdon Baird . The Squire was proud of his position as patron and inseparable companion of the famous boxer Charley Mitchell , a man who had once fought a three-hour draw with John L. Sullivan . One evening in the bar the Squire and Mitchell had an argument . Suddenly the Squire slapped Mitchell in the face . To the amazement of the onlookers the quicktempered Mitchell did nothing . Again the  | Squire slapped him and again Mitchell did nothing . This same scene was repeated in various other Saratoga bars until finally one day a friend asked Mitchell how he could stand such treatment . Mitchell smiled . " The truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Squire pays me $100 every blow he lands . " Dapperest of all Saratoga 's Dapper Dans was Berry Wall . One evening in August 1888 , he announced that the next day he would appear in forty complete changes of costume . The next morning before breakfast the crowd began gathering in front of the United States Hotel , where Wall had a first-floor room . Out on the street no less a figure than John L. Sullivan started making book on the outcome of Saratoga 's greatest sartorial steeplechase . Just before breakfast Wall appeared . He was dressed in a handsome black and white costume . He stood on the piazza , waved and talked a moment or two with his friends , took a quick stroll up and down , then disappeared inside . A few moments later he was out again , this time garbed in white linen and this time he took a quick walk around the block . All through the day he continued the parade . Sometimes he strolled across to the bar for a drink , sometimes he strolled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another change ? to his room where his unseen valet was methodically assisting him , hanging out each new outfit in fireman 's fashion . Finally , just at dinnertime , John L. Sullivan led the crowd in three long cheers , the band out under the trees struck up " Hail the Conquering Hero Comes , " and Wall , for the fortieth time , appeared . As his final outfit he wore a Prince Albert , white tie , boiled shirt , and poke collar . The title of the King of the Dudes was his forever . The charm of Saratoga in those days lay , of course , in its utter lack of self-consciousness and its lack of any defensive feeling toward wealth ? a feeling which has latterly been the bane of all social resorts . III EVEN in later years ? in the pre-Depression years of this century ? Saratoga had a gaiety which elder Saratogians miss today . At that time , Mrs. Edward Hamilton Hough recalls , there was really such a thing as Saratoga Society , for a great many people came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either come for a short while , as to Virginia Hot Springs , to take the waters and baths following the Newport or Palm Beach seasons , or else they are the horse Society which comes just in August for the races . In the latter case , Mrs. Hough is not at all sure she is glad they come at all . " Horse Society , " she says , " is a hodge-podge . It 's anybody who owns a horse . " There are those , to be sure , who would consider Saratoga gay even today ; who would regard as pretty highly geared such a life as is lived during August by Mr. and Mrs. John A. Morris . 1Ir . Morris is vice president of the Saratoga Association for the Improvement of the Breed of Horses ; Mrs. Morris , the former Edna Brokaw , feels that if raising horses is very expensive , this is all the better from the point of view of Society , because " it 's so expensive that it takes more than one generation of money . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two guest-rooms full of guests , " she says , " two couples , that is , because we feel that six in the total group with my husband and myself is enough . We have breakfast 7:30 to 11:00 , trays going up , guests coming down , then tennis or nine holes of golf or perhaps even a drink of the waters , . then back before lunch to kiss or spank the children depending on their behavior , then off to the track for lunch and the races , then back either to go to a cocktail party or give one , then either go to a dinner or give one , then bridge or canasta till I do n't know when ? well , one , maybe ? then bed . The next clay we do it all over again ? for four weeks . " Lively as this sort of regime sounds , it is not , in the opinion of older Saratogians. anything to what the resort was in the old days . Saratoga 's beloved " Three Musketeers , " actor Monty Woolley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom live in the resort year-round , are particularly amazed at the changes that have taken place since then . Today Knapp and Sullivan have formed a two-man Society for the Restoration and Preservation of NineteenthCentury Saratoga . " We are keeping Woolley out , " says Sullivan . " That 's what clubs are for , are n't they ? Anyway , he did n't get here until he was almost three years old . He 's a carpet-bagger. "  | For his part Woolley , the third Musketeer , yields to no one in his love of the old days . The son of the Grand Union 's great proprietor , W. Edgar Woolley , Monty recalls that his father had no worries about the fact that W. B. Gage , proprietor of the United States Hotel , had a higher proportion of the haut monde than the Grand Union . " Gage can have the Vanderbilts , " the elder Woolley once declared . " I 'll take the money . " As a young boy Monty remembers morning and evening symphony concerts , band music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open at either the Grand Union or the United States , move on to Congress Hall and then back to whichever hotel , the Union or the States , in which they had not begun . When he was four years old Woolley got his thespian start by dancing a sailor 's hornpipe on a grass stage ; on his seventh birthday he was allowed to conduct Victor Herbert 's fifty-fourpiece symphony orchestra in the " Little Edgar Polka . " " There was in. those days , " he says , " a wonderful slow tempo to life . Even the weather was warmer . God , what a lovely time it was to live ! " Even the younger members of Saratoga 's horse Society seem to have quieted down , in the opinion of the old-timers . It was only yesterday , they feel , when such youngsters were really horsing around in style . They enjoy recalling the gayer episodes ? how , for example , ' " Liz " Whitney used to wear an emerald necklace with riding clothes one day and the next would arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evening dress and accompanied by a small herd of dogs . They also recall the time when " Ella " Widener threw an egg at a judge in night court , and when young Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt sent a hopeless horse out to race in the Saratoga Cup , and , knowing his jockey would be out a long time , gave him , in lieu of riding orders , a sandwich , a container of milk , and a wrist compass . IV John HAY WHITNEY and his sister Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson , joint owners A of the famous Greentree Stables of their late mother , Mrs. Payne Whitney , recall that their mother made money out of Greentree only one year out of all the years she ran it . And despite the fact that they have already had two winning years out of the eight they have run the stables , they do not feel that horse-racing is a money-making proposition . Other Saratoga Society stable owners support this view . In their opinion the only owners who regularly make money are the socalled " gyp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two horses and just enter them in races when they know they have an excellent chance to win . Saratogian Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt , who was running his own stable at the age of twenty-one , won $300,000 in purses one of his first years . He was asked how the stable made out for the whole year . " They have n't figured it out yet , " said Vanderbilt . " I 'm either $10 ahead or $10 behind . " Old Saratogians agree that the best place to see what is left of Saratoga Horse Society is in the annual yearling sales which occur during the second and third weeks of August . Held at nine o'clock in the evening , the show opens with the arrival , one by one , of the elders of Saragota Society in their chauffeurdriven limousines . Moving past the bright lights of the boxing-ring enclosures they take  | their box seats with their accustomed assurance . Then , one by one , the horses are brought in to stand , in the bright lights , usually with considerably less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stableboy sweeps up behind , and an auctioneer sounds off : " Ladies and gentlemen , that 's mighty little money and a whole lot of horse . " The bids are not delivered to the auctioneer at all but are relayed by delicate signals forwarded by ushers in the aisles . Indeed , so delicate are these signals that , for a non-bidding spectator , it is dangerous to make any motion at all ; turf writer Joe Palmer recalls accepting a $15,000 bid by a gentleman who was trying to brush a fly off his neck . Like the Saratoga racetrack , which is known as the graveyard of favorites , the yearling sales have over the years provided some startling results . The most famous yearling ever sold , of course , was Man o ' War , who went to Samuel Riddle in 1917 for $5,000 ; in purses and stud fees " Big Red , " as he was called , brought in over $3,000,000 . In contrast Man o ' War 's son , Broadway Limited , cost W. T. Waggoner $65,000 in 1928 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attempting to win a $900 purse in 1930 , he rounded the stretch turn in front and , finding himself for the first time in his life ahead , suddenly dropped dead . Even the yearling sales , however , do not seem to old Saratogians to have held up as well as they should have . " Years ago , " says Mrs. John F. C. Bryce , a former Newporter , " you used to know everybody , and everybody came in evening clothes . Now everybody comes in anything , and you 're lucky if you know the first five rows . " The characters , too , at the sales seem to have deteriorated . Mrs. Payne Whitney had the reputation of buying any horse who looked at her sadly ; at one sale she bought seventeen horses . Curiously enough , this deterioration in horse Society has been accompanied , in the view of old-timers , with a deterioration in the actual races themselves . The old-timers will tell you that they do not have races any more like the one , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , Man o ' War was beaten for the first and only time in his career ? and by a horse , of course , named Upset ? or the one on the rainy afternoon of August 16 , 1930 , when two of the greatest race horses in America , Gallant Fox , ridden by the fabulous Earl Sands , and Whichone , with Sonny Workman up , were both , incredibly , beaten ? by six lengths ? by a 100-to-1 outsider named Jim Dandy . V IF OLD Saratogians were to choose one man as symbolic of the spa in its heyday , the choice would undoubtedly fall on Richard Albert Canfield . Son of an improvident New Bedford printer , Canfield went to work at fifteen in the shipping department of the Boston firm of Jordan Marsh &; Co. ; but he soon abandoned dry goods for his life work ? gambling . Although he never in his life played the game of solitaire to which he gave his name , Canfield early learned everything there was to know about his trade ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the age of twenty , he was worth , by his own estimate , $20,000 . The next year he toured the casinos of Europe , and , studying them carefully , returned penniless . Always popular with the ladies ? he later married a Pawtucket girl ? he was far from backward in preparing himself for Saratoga 's Flash Age . Even when he was between jobs his suit , jewelry , and cigars were the best money could borrow , if not buy , and his suave manners , studied courtesy , and remarkable ability to remember names won him not only respect but also jobs . Then , at the age of thirty , Canfield saw his faro house in Providence raided and he was sentenced to six months in jail . Instead of breaking the rising young gambler , however , the jail sentence made him . " Jail , " he used  | to say in after years , " was my Harvard . " From the prison library he procured all kinds of books , on history , literature , and particularly art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as his betters without the fear of being humiliated by his lack of education . Canfield took his self-improvement with extreme seriousness . Later in his life returning incognito from an art-buying trip abroad , he was faced with filling in. on his customs declarations , the space after the word " business . " He found it no problem . " Gentleman , " he wrote . The only portrait of Canfield in existence was painted by his friend Whistler . In this , Canfield , dressed in dark robes , has his chunky hands clasped piously over his chest , a sanctimonious smile on his round , clean-shaven face , and one of his eyes half shut . Whistler called the portrait " His Reverence " ? a title which Canfield , who never went to church , cherished . " If there is such a thing as an honest gambler , " says Monty Woolley , whose father was one of Canfield 's closest friends , " Canfield was that man . " Canfield was the first American gambler to extend credit on a large scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Alexander Gardiner , " and it was his theory that a man clad in a dress suit or a tuxedo did not care to carry a large amount of money with him . " Although Canfield took some severe losses on this theory ? one man who gave him an IOU for $137,000 and never paid is still alive today ? the result was remarkably in his favor . His Club House became the most successful gambling house in resort history , and it changed the character of Saratoga from a fading resort of politicians and show-offs to one which was , for a brief last gasp at least , a social rival of Newport and Bar Harbor . This record was the more extraordinary since the Club House was in operation only from 1894 to 1907 . Like Bradley at Palm Beach , Canfield permitted no native to gamble . Unlike Bradley , however , he never permitted ladies in the gambling rooms . But ladies as well as gentlemen enjoyed Canfield 's cuisine . He paid his French chef , Jean Columbin , $5,000 for a two-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's or Delmonico 's and many of the " American Plan " hotel guests ate even their breakfasts there , the restaurant invariably lost money . Canfield did not mind in the slightest ; for him the restaurant was only the comeon , and indeed its outstanding feature ? its fish pool ? was actually a come-on . In this fish pool near the Club House were trout and bass and all manner of piscatorial delicacies gaily swimming . Patrons ordering fish courses were invited to go out to this pool and pick out their choice . Then the fish was , before the diner 's very eyes , scooped out with a net , placed in a basket , and taken to the kitchen . What the diner 's eye did not see , of course , was the fact that there was a pipe connecting the kitchen with the pool , and when the fish was safely in the kitchen , it was replaced by another and slid back into the pool . In the gaming rooms Canfield needed no such chicanery . Once asked point-blank if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All any gambler wants is to have play for a long enough time and he 'll get all the money any player has . In business if you and I can lend money enough at 5 per cent we think we are doing pretty well . Every time a roulette wheel is spun , the percentage on a 36-inch wheel is 5 5/19 per cent against the player . Therefore you will say that I get an interest on my money of 5 5/19 per cent every time a roulette wheel is spun . " In Canfield 's gaming room the play was on a scale commensurate with the size of the rug ? one which was reportedly the largest ever woven in one piece . In Canfield 's safe , which had five combinations and three heavy steel doors , there was a million dollars in cash , half of it in $1,000 bills , the rest in $500s , $100s , and $50s . Ordinarily white chips were worth $1 ; red , $5 ; blue , $10 ; yellow , $100 ; and special large-size brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , sometimes saw the white chip raised to $100 and the brown to $100,000 . The biggest game ever played in Canfield 's , or in fact at any gambling house in resort history , was played in one of these upstairs rooms on an August evening in 1902 . The player was John W. " Bet-a-Million " Gates . A former barbed-wire salesman from Chicago , a millionaire by the . time he was thirty , Gates was a large , gross man whose vulgarity so offended J. P. Morgan that the latter excluded  | him from the board of directors of the billiondollar United States Steel Corporation , even though the project had originally been Gates ' idea . Vulgar or not , Gates had no equal as a gambler . " There 's no fun in it , " he used to say , " unless I risk getting hurt or can hurt the other fellow . " That afternoon fifty years ago Gates had had-a most unsuccessful day at the track . To one bookmaker alone he had lost $30,000 . That evening he had dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaming room . Here , at the faro tables , he took the regular limit , $500 on case cards and $1,000 on doubles . He lost steadily and , in order to change his luck , went up to a private room upstairs . Here the limit was raised to $2,500 and $5,000 . Still Gates lost . At ten o'clock , out some $100,000 , Gates asked for higher limits . " Billy " Coe , Canfield 's manager , told him only Canfield himself himself could give a higher limit . " I 'll see him , " said Gates , and went downstairs . He found Canfield and asked that the limits be raised to $5,000 and $10,000 . " You may have it , " said Canfield quietly . Then as Gates turned back , Canfield added , " If that is n't enough , come back and see me . " Between ten o'clock and midnight Gates had won back the $150,000 he had lost . By the time the game ended at eight o'clock the following morning , Gates was $150,000 ahead . THERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in jail . This is false . ( The jail idea is due to a confusion with his earlier sentence . ) Worth some $12,000,000 in 1907 at the time he closed the Saratoga Club House , he lost in the panic of that year at least half his fortune in the stock market . In one day he lost $1,500,000 . But at his own death his estate was appraised at $841,485 , and he was by no means a broken man . In 1910 his assiduously cultivated friendships with art connoisseurs and literary men had resulted in his membership in the Walpole Society ; in 1914 he was still nursing the hope that he would be included in the next edition of Who 's Who in America . But Canfield never lived to achieve this ambition . On the morning of December 11 , 1914 , at the age of fifty-nine , the Prince of Gamblers at the King of Spas took a subway trip to Brooklyn . Becoming confused , like so many lesser people before his time and after , he got off his train at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs , he realized his mistake , and , in an attempt to get down the stairs before the car doors closed , he slipped and fell . The next morning he was dead .  |
