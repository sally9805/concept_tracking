txt In a hitherto unpublished report , Henry A. Wallace as Vice President urged Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944 to consider the Chinese Nationalist leader , Chiang Kai-shek , only as a " short-term investment , " neither intelligent enough nor politically strong enough for postwar China . " At this time , " Mr. Wallace wrote in that war year , " there seems to be no  --  alternative to support of Chiang . " But , he added , " the leaders of postwar China will be brought forward by evolution or revolution , and it now seems more likely the latter . " Mr. Wallace 's views of 1944 Were brought to light today . A copy of the report , which he had made to President Roosevelt at the conclusion of a mission to China , was made available by Senator Herbert R. O'Conor , Democrat , of Maryland , to whom the ' former Vice President had sent it , on request , some weeks ago . Meanwhile , Secretary of State Dean Acheson told his press conference that he hopeu a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese people , although he foresaw no such development now . Do n't Want Recognition The seizure by Chinese Communists of the United States Consulate ? property at Peiping , the Secretary said in answer to questions , made it an obvious conclusion that the Communists did not want our recognition of their regime . Yesterday , in carrying forward a Republican attack on the Truman Administration for its refusal to grant further military aid to the Chinese Nationalists against the Communists , Senator Homer Ferguson of Michigan had asserted that a " secret report " by . Mr. Wallace had been the basis of United States policy up to now . This policy , Mr. Ferguson contended , had been to " coerce or destroy " Generalissimo Chiang to the benefit of the Chinese Communists . The State Department had declared yesterday that it had no record of a " secret report " by Mr. Wallace . At the department this afternoon it was said that , the whereabouts of the report was unknown , but that at all events it had been " referred to in a footnote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued last summer . It was found that the footnote in question had been appended to a passage saying that Mr. Wallace had been sent to China by President Roosevelt to try to consolidate the Chinese war effort against Japan and had held conversations with Generalissimo Chiang . " No Bearing on Issues " " The notes made on these conversations indicate that a wide range of ' topics was discussed , of which the majority have no bearing on the events and issues described in the present paper , " it was asserted in the White Paper , which was an explanation and defense of this country 's China policy . While the White Paper dealt at some length with the talks between Mr. Wallace and Chiang , it did not disclose any recommendations that Mr. Wallace had made . The copy of the Wallace report // CHIANG TOO WEAK , WALLACE REPORTED // given to Senator O'Gonor not only carried conclusions and recommendations but indicated that others had been dispatched by the then Vice President by telegraph from New Delhi . Mr. Wallace 's central conclusion was that Generalissimo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by an " unenlightened " administration supported by " landlords , warlords and bankers . " He complained that the Generalissimo was " so prejudiced against the Communists " as to leave little prospect of a settlement with them . The then Vice President held that while it was necessary for the time being to go on backing Generalissimo Chiang , the United States should be on the lookout for " any other leader or group that might come forward offering greater promise . " Mr. Wallace 's newly discovered report , it appeared , would add new heat to the long debate over China . Senators were studying . it tonight for ammunition , and it was understood that a Democratic counterattack upon many points of Senator Ferguson 's speech was being prepared . For example , Mr. Ferguson had asserted , in his prepared statement , that the State Department 's White Paper , which he called " a whitewash paper , " had said that " there is no record of a report on that visit . " The Democrats were ready to retort , with text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact reported on at least some of the Wallace-Chiang conversations . The Republicans , on their side , were expected to use the Wallace document in support of their general argument that an administration tendency to " write off " Generalissimo Chiang began to be manifest years before the Generalissimo had been defeated in the field by the Communists . During the day , a scheduled appearance of Secretary of State Dean Acheson before the House Foreign Affairs Committee was postponed until next week because the Republican members were otherwise occupied for the afternoon . ? news conference Secretary Acheson said the very essence of recognition was the exchange of representatives , and that an exchange of representatives , in turn , must rest on a basis of mutual respect and international . law and custom . The Secretary said no such basis now existed , and noted the difficulties with the Communists in the cases of Angus Ward , United State Consul General in Mukden , and of Marine Master Sergeant E. C. Bender and Navy Chief Electrician William C. Smith , who were arrested and imprisoned at Tsingtao . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Peiping consulate property , continued Mr. Acheson , we witnessed violation of treaty rights confirmed as late as 1943 . It all indicated , he added , that our representatives were not going to be treated as they should be , and that the question of recognition could not comeup or be considered in such a situation .
