Dear Time-Reader <P> With the warmer spring weather , and with the northward migration of millions of birds , two of TIME 'S writers are beginning to hear more questions about their favorite spare-time activity-prowling the woods and fields looking at birds , counting them , imitating their calls and studying their habits . For them it is an all-weather , year-round pastime which calls for old clothes , field glasses and an abundant knowledge of bird lore . They know , for instance , that a robin sings , not because he is happy , but because he has just staked out a claim to a clump of trees or a bride , and his song is a chirp-on-shoulder challenge to the rest of the robin community . <P> The two writers , longtime members of the nation 's fast-growing legion of field birders , * are Gilbert Cant and George Daniels . Why do they study birds ? Both are a little vague on the subject , except to say that , once they started doing it , they liked it so well that they kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , where he saved the illustrated cards that came in packages of cigarettes . There was one series on birds . Says he : " That got me interested , and I started hiking around the countryside and beaches of England . I got dozens of books on birds from the public library . I guess the satisfaction of birding starts with actually seeing the birds that one has read about . " <P> Daniels ' initiation was somewhat more opportunistic . He was keeping company with a girl whose father was a serious ornithologist , and who once asked Daniels if he liked birds . " Sure , I love birds , " answered Daniels diplomatically . So the girl 's father took him along on a birding excursion , and Daniels has been fascinated with the sport ever since . ( He also married the girl , no birder herself . ) <P> Both Cant and Daniels are members of the Urner Ornithological Club in New Jersey . Cant , who was president of the club for two years , credits the late Charles Anderson Urner , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the dickey-bird stage . " Cant has never totaled the birds he has seen on four continents and dozens of Pacific islands , but he was once a member of a party that sighted the only western grebe ever seen in New Jersey . Daniels has a " life list " of some 800 different species . They include about 100 he has seen in Europe and 50 more on a recent trip to Jamaica .
