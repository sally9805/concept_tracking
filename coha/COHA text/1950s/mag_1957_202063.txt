People have asked me many times about what happened that day , in that seventh-inning clutch , when Alexander was called in from the bullpen to relieve Haines . They wanted to know what I said and what Alex said , and whether he had a gin bottle out there in the bullpen . <P> - Rogers Hornsby <P> The Rajah never bothered to deny that Grover Cleveland Alexander had sipped a few before he took over from Haines and struck out Yankee Tony Lazzeri to save the 1926 World Series for the Cardinals . It seemed a workable way of staying calm in the clutch . Now there is another way . <P> No manager would tolerate a gin bottle in dugout or bullpen . So what explained the sudden spurt of skill of Detroit Third Baseman Reno Bertoia ? For two full seasons , and even this spring , Bonus Baby Bertoia sometimes performed like a crossfoot clown in the field and was too tense at bat to hit his hat size . Still , as the season started , Bertoia was given the nod over Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an error , and at week 's end he was second in the American League in batting with a hefty .375 ( behind Boston 's Ted Williams ' .385 ) . <P> Last week Reno explained . " I swallow one little white tranquilizer pill a half hour before each game . Occasionally , if things get a little tense , I 'll take the top off my bottle and take another . " <P> Reno 's release from tension was first suggested by former Giant Mel Ott , now a Detroit sportscaster , who noticed that tenseness was hurting Bertoia 's swing at the plate . Tiger Trainer Jack Homel took the message to Reno , and the young man ( 22 ) promptly tried Equanil , later switched to Sedamyl . Reno , it turned out , was not the first Detroit athlete to try tranquilizers . Says Osteopath Richard Thompson , team physician for the Detroit Lions football team : " We used them on at least five Lions last year , and we intend to continue to use them . " The Tigers ' Dr. Luther Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Reno : " I would n't give them up for the world-not with this batting average . "
