Said to Serve Soviet . Designs . . . To-THE EDITOR OF TH.E. ? NEW YOFtK TIMES : The feeble gesture of the United NatiOns , ' in ending its futile ? diplomatic blockade of Spain , made originally at the behest of the ' SOviet.Union , is a ' beIated ' acknowledgment ? of - an unjust affront to the dignity of a great ' people . They ' are entitled , however , to a there ample and honorable reparation . Never has any nation been subjected to such misrepresentation and abuse . Now that Prejudices ' and- passions are abating someWhat in the face of the Communist menace-it , is becoming possible to evaluate this deplorable situation more clearly . I firmly believe that a dispassionate survey will clearly establish the basic facts . The principal- enemy . of Spain and the prime instigator of the policy of isolating the people of Spain has been the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' revolution , boasted twenty-five years ago , the Soviet Union confidently expected that Spain would be the first Western European nation to ' go Communist , and that France would be next . To accomplish its- purpose it employed in Spain for the first time the thinly disguised subterfuge of the " Popular Front , " which eventually resulted in the control of the Republican Government by the Communists . It organized the camouflaged Abraham Lincoln Brigade , having its headquarters in Washington in order to lure many American liberals to sacrifice their lives in the Spanish Civil War . It abetted the bitter warfare against the Catholic Church , resulting in the destruction of many churches and the execution of many priests . Because of the intervention of Hitler and Mussolini to thwart ' Communist designs inSpain the Soviet Union raised , and continues to raise , the false issue of " fascism " as the greatest enemy of democracy , though willing to enter into an alliance with Hitler to fight England and France . ' BY skillful propaganda the Soviet Union was able to wreak its wrathful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the United Nations to punish the entire Spanish nation . The exclusion of the people of Spain from participation in the Marshall Plan and from aiding in the reconstruction and defense of Western Europe could only serve the sinister designs of the Soviet Union . The United Nations was led to adopt the unjust principle of intervention in the internal politics of independent nations . It became a forum for fomenting discord rather than for mutual understanding and respect . The mad attempt to dictate to the Spanish people the kind of government they should have could result only in what is termed in their language " contraproducente " ? that is , it would constrain these proud , self-respecting people , irrespective of their private convictions , to rally to ' the support of the Franco dictatorship . They can hardly be expected to consider the action of the United Nations in lifting its diplomatic blockade ' as much mole than a clumsy apology . In the light of the strangely ignored facts of ' this situation the United Nations ; now ? that it is resisting the designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make complete amends to the people of Spain and recognize theirrightful place in the great family of independent nations . PHILIP MARSHALL BROWN . Williamstown , Mass. , Nov. 6 , 1950. ing from $5,000 to $10,000 a year could move into these new buildings and pay , for four ' rooms from $90. to $112 pea ' month , with gas and electricity free int many Oases . My ' interest , ' and there are a lot like - me , lies in knowing about the $3,000 - to $4,000 a year income group , where families can not afford the high rentals , but can pay only $15- a room . Such priced buildings are not being built . For these families it is really a prob . lem , not for , the larger-income group . With the low-income families itt mind the Federal Government should step in and provide these people with housing they can- afford , such as four rooms for $60 , ? This would be doing something for the average American family . SAM H. ARONoWiTz . Brooklyn , Nov .. 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urged as Alternative to Federal Tax To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As organizer and chairman of the Musicians ' Committee to Promote Government Subsidies for Music Projects I was gratified to see that the powerful NEW YORK TIMES considers the survival of music as a living art important enough to write the editorial on " Music and Taxes . " I do not agree that the exemption of non-profit cultural- organizations such as the opera and symphonic orchestras from the federal admission tax would be practical or effective . In the first place , it is the pablic who pays the taX and will object to paying it if the tax is repealed . Secondly , ' it would not solve the problem at hand , to prevent the gradual but swift disappearance of music as a living art . By approaching Government officials with the aim of obtaining certain privileges the applicant stands a better chance ? to obtain satisfaction in demonstrating that by granting support the Government would incur no expense either to itself or to the people . Under the prevailing conditions Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few facts on the strength of which my belief is based . It is common knowledge that music as a profession is shot to pieces . The maaline is the indisputable master of the situation . The official Journal of our union , Local 802 , states that , since March of this year alone , many hun dreds of memberships were terminated for non-payment of dues . Not so long . ago all these musicians were taxpayers ; now they are on relief . Teachers of stringed instruments who used to teach from morning till night are now struggling to make a living . Violin makers sell hardly half as many instruments as they used to .. The same is true of the music publishers and sheet-music dealers . Since ; the musicians who are responsible for the existence and prosperity of the Music industry are forced out of ? existence , it is natural that the whole music industry will gradually collapse . This will mean a serious loss in taxes to the Government . If we permit prevailing conditions to continue , we may expect that within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make records or play ' for sound-pictures . The tremendous amounts collected in taxes from these sources will also dwindle . To prevent the calamity of letting music as a living art disappear from our culture , all the Government would ? have to do is to grant subsidies for : , . music projects throughout the country . This would give new life to all bunches of music , ' musicians and the music industry . The Government would again collect in taxes more than the covering of deficits would require . If the board of directors both of the Metropolitan Opera . and the Philhar monic-Symphony Society would be willing to give serious thought to my , suggestion they might be nearer the solution of their problems than by urging the repeal of the admission tax . JOSEPH MALKIN . New York , Nov. 6 , 1950 . World Police Force for Peace To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : " The Problem . of Disarmament , " as discussed in the leading editorial of the Oct. 27 issue of your werthy publication , is a masterpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was my good fortune to raise ' three sons in this our beloved country . As a young mother , together with many other young mothers , my slogan was , " No ammunition . " Another popular slogan during that period was " Let 's talk it over . " Present world events certainly brought about a revision of our way of thinking . We now know that there , are nations who talk instead of talking , it over . We also know that there is no way to maintain peace in ' any community , large or small , without a police force commensurate with its needs . And thus , I , and most likely many of my peace-loving contemporaries , vote for a world police force for the main . tenance of peace . Strength to the . TTnitpa Nations ! JEANNETTE S. SEIDMAN , President , The Inter-Racial Press of America . New York , Nov. 4 , 1950 . I KNOW A MAN . Grutzner Dispatch on Executions To ' run EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Charles Grutzner has given us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like a Goya drawing , it is a powerful ' word-portrait of one facet ' of war . The face of war , even a war without atomic weapons , is agony . Grutzner is writing about the " Red collaborators , " those Koreans who out of circumstance were doubtfully on the other side . Yet we feel compassion no less . Humanity lives and dies with the Kiisang girl who now sings for her lover 's return , now cries for her baby . In  --  the.end , we hear the Korean singing " Nearer My - God to Thee " as he faces death , and we are reminded that in answer to the evil in the world there is another way . CARL COLODNE . New York , Nov. 3 , 1950 . Aeain a Correction of Corrector To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW Yorue Times : It is with diffidence that I venture to correct your correspondent Horace ' C. Whiteman , who describes himself as " the individual who would undertake to correct the man who corrects THE NEW YORK TIMES . " The use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a solecism that no less an authority than the Oxford English Dictionary condemns as a " colloquial vulgarism . " Fowler 's Modern English Usage says : " The test for the right use of the word as opposed to the ' colloquial vulgarism ' ( 0 . E. D. ) is the question whether the writer means or not to contrast the person he ' calls an individual with society , the family , or some body of persons . " NEWMAN LEVY . New York , Nov. 2 , 1950 . Housing for Low-Income Groups To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I read with curiosity a letter written by Joseph D. Blau regarding the housing plight of middle-income families . Mr. Blau states that no new buildings have gone up wherein an , apartment may be rented at $20 to $30 a room . I would like to know where Mr. Blau has been for the past three or four years . If he will ' look about him in various sections of the city he will find that hundreds of houses are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who would reclaim Lost days that came like wind or wave : The times when love and life were one . a - And what he had did not enslave : He stands and stares beyond his door ' Who knows the sum of love and pain , And all his joy is hid like thought In dreams that shall not come again .
