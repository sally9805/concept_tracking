In unison , French Communists stood up in the National Assembly and cried , 150 voices strong : " Popular Front ! " The other politicians in the divided Assembly , though they clapped their hands over their ears and refused to listen , could not entirely shut out the echoing , uncomfortable sound . <P> In the new National Assembly 's organizing sessions , the Communists politely withdrew their own candidate , aged hack Marcel Cachin , and made possible the speedy election of 71-year-old Socialist Andr Le Troquer as Assembly president ( Speaker ) . Without their support , he had been a poor third in the voting . <P> Then came time for that oft-repeated ritual , the summoning of party leaders by French President Ren Coty to " consult " on the choice of a new Premier . Red Leader Jacques Duclos , the onetime pastry cook , came away murmuring creamily : " Universal suffrage , in placing the Communist Party clearly at the head of all other parties , gave us the right to demand the premiership for a Communist . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible for the moment . In this situation , I have proposed that the President call a Socialist . . . " <P> <P> President Coty had already decided to do just that . The man he sent for was 50-year-old Socialist Party Leader Guy Mollet , the onetime English teacher from Pas-de-Calais ( TIME , Jan. 23 ) . After some tight dickering with his electoral ally , Pierre Mends-France , Mollet settled on a Cabinet , giving Mends the job of Deputy Premier without portfolio ( instead of Foreign Minister , which Mendes desired ) . For Foreign Minister he reached instead into his own party for Good European Christian Pineau. 51 , stepson of Playwright Jean ( The Madwoman of Chaillot ) Giraudoux and himself an author of children 's fairy stories . Mollet spurned the Communist support proffered ( " Let no one think that I 'm the man to prepare the future of Popular Front . . . I will never lead my party to suicide " ) , but seemed fated to get it anyway . Ultimately , said Communist Duclos complacently , " popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Popular Front .
