txt WASHINGTON , March 14 ? A study released by a Senate committee said today that " economic aid to satellite nations , as a counter-offensive against the Soviet Union , stands little prospect of success . " The study , one of eleven commissioned by a special Senate committee to study the foreign aid program , is the work of the Council for Economic and Industry Research , Inc. , a commercial research organization . The report , which was prepared since the Soviet troubles in Poland and Hungary , said : " Aid offered to Poland and Hungary in recent months , if accepted , might have strengthened pro-Western sentiment . If rejected , the position of the U. S. S. R. * * * might have been further weakened . " Diversion of Aid Feared But after conceding the possible " psychological " advantages of aid to Soviet satellites , the report argues that " any substantial economic aid merely serves to strengthen the total economic system the Communist bloc is able to administer and exploit . " The report says further : " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials and possibly capital goods , were allowed to flow into the satellites , there is no assurance even that the satellite peoples will gain a net benefit , since equal amounts might be diverted elsewhere * * * . " The report is published at a time when a Polish delegation has been negotiating for two weeks with the State Department on an aid agreement . The Poles reportedly have Pequested $200,000,000 worth of surplus farm products to be paid for in zlotys , and a $100 , - 000,000 Export-Import Bank loan to purchase machinery . A. Barrier to Loan A difficulty on the surplus commodity purchase is that Public Law 480 , which permits such sales , expires June 30 , and only a small amount of its $3,000,000,000 authority remains uncommitted or unpledged . The President , however , has requested $1,000,000,000 more for the program . A barrier to the Export-Import loan is the Battle Act , which prohibits such loans to countries trading in war materials with the Soviet Union . The President indicated at his news conference yesterday that he might ask for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , it is believed that the total loan offered by the United States will be under $100,000,000 . But any loan , no matter how small or of what nature , may provoke sharp controversy in // Congress . Some legislators whose constituencies include PolishAmerican voters have declared themselves favorable to Polish aid . The ' opposition is led by Senator William F. Knowland of California , Republican leader of the Senate . The opposition may , be expected to seize on the re- , port issued today . Actually , the recommendation , against aid to Soviet satellites ' is only a small part of the study , ' which deals with the foreign , assistance activities of the Communist bloc and their implications for the United States . The study reports that from 1953 , when Moscow began its economic offensive , through 1956 , the Communist bloc extended credits to underdeveloped countries amounting to $1,400 , - 1000,000 . ' Arms Shipments Financed ADout one-fourth of these credits financed arms shipments to Egypt , Syria and Afghanistan . The balance was used mainly for financing capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans are barter arrangements in which the Soviet bloc takes surplus products . Although the results are " modest " thus far , the report says that " the export capability of the U. S. S. R. will grow in the years ahead , " and the Soviet bloc " has the capability potentially of taking a dominant position in the economic life of Southeast Asia and the Middle East countries in the course of time . " This may well happen , the report warns , " unless Western capital exports and trade with these areas grow . " It says that any " faltering in the economic growth of these countries and their consequent frustration might impel them toward the Soviet model . " The United States aid program , the authors hold , should not be a reaction to specific Soviet actions , but " a rational , steady approach to the economic development requirements of the recipient country . " Such a long-range plan would have " the merit of providing a relatively steady flow of capital , " which is necessary for the development of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
