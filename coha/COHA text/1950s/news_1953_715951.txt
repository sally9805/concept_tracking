txt Governor Dewey will propose , when the 1954 Legislature meets , a renewed assault on the problem of slum clearance housing through a multi-million dollar bond issue . He has been told by state housing experts that sub-standard urban housing , particularly in New York City , is spreading at a rate that can not be checked by private capital or by existing state bond and subsidy programs . No decision had been reached on the size of the proposed bond issue , but discussions have centered on $265,000,000 . An issue at that figure , if it obtains legislative and voter permission , will increase to an even $1,000,000,000 the maximum state borrowing permitted for housing purposes . If approved by the Legislature , , the bond issue will be one of two to go on the 1954 state ballot . Administration aides have revealed that the Governor wants an issue also of $300,000,000 to $500,000,000 to finance expansion and rehabilitation of the state mental hospitals . Exception on ' Propositions ' State bond issues must . be approved once by the Legislature and then by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ordinarily , only one such " proposition " is permitted on the ballot in any given year , but an exception is made in the State Constitution for housing bond proposals . The state has about exhausted its resources for housing purposes . At present there is a ceiling of $735,000,000 on the amount it can raise through bonds to finance construction of public housing projects . When the current fiscal year ends on March 31 , about $642,000 , - 000 of the $735,000,000 will have been committed and state housing officials predict that the remaining $93,000,000 will be used up before the end of 1955 . In the subsidies the state pays to keep rent levels low at public projects it is limited to $25,000,000 a year . By the close of the 1953-54 fiscal year , $22,000,000 of this maximum will have been committed to aid projects in existence or nearing completion , with little left to apply in future construction . Although these ceilingp would probably permit continuation of a state housing program for another year and a bit more , Governor Dewey is reported to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to allow slum clearance planning to proceed unchecked , well in advance of actual . construction . Process for Subsidies Rise Authority to increase housing subsidies is obtained by the same ( process as for new bond issues Two propositions , one to increase the gross annual subsidy permitted and the other to increase the maximum annual subsidy payments , must be approved first by the Legislature and then by the voters . Money to finance the subsidy payments is taken from current operating revenues in the regular budget , not ' from bond issues . If the Governor seeks and obtains next year authority for increased subsidies , an appropriation to cover them would appear for the // first time in the 1955-56 budget . The Governor also plans to make a personal effort to induce progress in the rate at which potential slum areas are rehabilitated through local , rather than slate , efforts . He has decided to call a housing conference , probably in New York City , some time during the forth . coming legislative session . He believes that there is no reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rehabilitated , but he feels that this is a job best handled by local government and private lending sources , with an emphasis on enforcement of fire and health codes . An aide reported that the Governor was convinced that " our cities need preventive medicine as well as surgery " and that moves to halt degeneration of large areas into slums were primarily a local responsibility . Under present plans , the message the Governor delivers to the ? Legislature when it convenes Jan. 6 will not recommend a specific figure for the housing bond issue . This question will be thrashed out in conferences with the legislative leaders and housing officials . At the close of the current fiscal year , the state public housing program will have produced 50,000 dwelling units accommodating . 205,000 persons . Most of this construction has been in the years since World War IL Although only thirty-one of the seventy-seven projects completed are in- New York City , the city units account for more than 80 per cent of the residents of state housing . To stress the size of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at the peak of the building boom of the Nineteen Twenties only about $100,000,000 a year in private capital was going into housing . Today , he said , the state alone was spending $64,000,000 a year on housing , and combined state and private resources were still falling short of the need .
