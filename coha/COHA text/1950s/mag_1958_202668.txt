On the front page of half a dozen West German newspapers last week , the glum visage of Sherman Adams was matched by a portrait-no less glum-of a German bureaucrat named Hans Kilb . It was no accident . For six years husky Lawyer Kilb , 48 , had served as appointments secretary and personal aide to West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer . Last week West Germany 's chief prosecutor slapped Kilb in jail " for investigative purposes . " The charge : suspicion of corruption . <P> Kilb 's troubles began last spring with a police investigation of reports that he had been accepting regular gift packages of coffee and other goodies from the company that operates West Germany 's railway sleeping cars . Soon after the investigation started , the West German civil service decided that Kilb had been in Adenauer 's office long enough , got him named director of security for the European Atomic Energy Community in Brussels . But the unforgiving police doggedly continued their investigation , discovered that more than a year ago Kilb acquired a Mercedes 190 SL sports car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Daimler-Benz Co. replaced it with a sky-blue Mercedes 220 S cabriolet . What even the most dogged search failed to uncover was any evidence that Bureaucrat Kilb had paid Daimler-Benz so much as a pfennig for either car . <P> Kilb 's defenders were quick with an explanation : the company had insisted on loaning Kilb the cars to make sure that he would not inconvenience Adenauer by arriving late at top-level government appointments . The fact that Kilb might be in a position to influence the Bonn government 's plans for restricting the size of trailer trucks-a subject of considerable interest to Daimler-Benz , as one of West Germany 's major manufacturers of trucks-had nothing to do with the case , they said . <P> Doing his best to keep a stiff upper lip , Press Chief Felix von Eckardt reassuringly announced that Adenauer himself would probably agree to testify on the matter-provided his Cabinet gave its consent . In case the Cabinet did n't , Adenauer 's Socialist opponents were preparing a batch of questions to throw at der Alte in the Bundestag . Among them : Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had also enjoyed the use of a " borrowed " car ?
