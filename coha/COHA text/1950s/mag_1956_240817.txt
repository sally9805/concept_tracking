It was as if the proudest Daughters of the American Revolution had suddenly been told that their ancestors were all spies in the pay of George III . " It does n't make the slightest difference whether a great family took part in the Crusades or not , " said aristocratic Count Emmanuel de Las Cases . " It is still a great family . " But very few French aristocrats were able last week to put so brave a front on the matter . The fact was that the patrician pedigrees of 250 aristocratic families had just had a great fall . <P> In the year 1839 , the Orleans " Citizen King , " Louis Philippe , anxious to curry favor with his nation 's snootier aristocrats , who generally held a low opinion of him , offered to display the armorial bearings of anyone able to provide proof of an ancestor who had fought in the Crusades . Within a year Versailles was overflowing with applicants , all of whom bore ancient documents to attest their claims . <P> <P> It was a curious fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans made by the Lombard bankers of Italy to Crusaders passing through-and all were unearthed by the same genealogist , one Henri Courtois . But if these facts caused any doubts to arise , they were promptly quelled by the further fact that the greatest medievalist in France , Director Leon Lacabane of the Ecole des Chartes , authenticated each one . <P> Two years ago a young medievalist named Robert-Henri Bautier found occasion to examine some of Genealogist Courtois ' documents more closely . With government help , he turned microscopes and ultraviolet rays on the moldy old parchments , only to discover that the ink and the writing on them was of a date far later than the parchments themselves . Wanting to be sure , Bautier enlisted the aid of police , archivists and other scholars , and set out in search of further knowledge of Genealogist Courtois . Last week , in the silent , august chamber of L'Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres , Scholar Bautier announced his findings : Henri Courtois , a onetime notary 's clerk and one of the shadiest characters of the 19th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ancient documents , *exacting a fee of 40,000 gold francs ( $10,000 ) apiece for his services . All 250 of the documents which he had produced for submission to King Louis Philippe were forgeries . <P> NOBILITY MARKET CRASHES headlined one Parisian newspaper . " It 's only normal , " said Robert-Henri Bautier as cries of anguish from France 's patricians poured in from every side , " that they refuse to believe us . " <P> <P> *One graduate of Courtois ' fake-factory , a celebrated forger named Vrain-Lucas , later went into business for himself , and managed to convince some of France 's finest scholars of the authenticity of hasty notes from Cleopatra to Caesar , Alexander to Aristotle and Lazarus to St. Peter , despite the fact that they were written in Old French .
