txt Little Rock 's difficult experiment in the integration of students-of the white and Negro races in the public schools will be interrupted for at least two and a half years if an order issued by United States District Judge Harry J. Lemley on Saturday is sustained . Judge Lemley based his decision on " the unfortunate racial strife and tension which existed in Little Rock during the past year and still exists there . " Even that sturdy battler for decency , Harry S. Ashmore , executive editor of The Arkansas Gazette , . has conceded that conditions in the Central High School of Little Rock are " intolerable . " The question we ask today is not whether Judge Lemley is right , or whether Mr. Ashmore is right , or whether the higher courts will sustain the ruling of the District Court . The question is , why does an " intolerable " degree of " racial strife and tension " arise when nine Negro students are admitted to a large city high school previously restricted to white children ? The evidence is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : first , interference by persons and organizations from outside Arkansas ; second , the attitude of Gov . Orval E. Faubus , who called out the National Guard to " restore order " by keeping Negro students out of the Central High School . There were plenty of people in Arkansas who were opposed to integration in the schools , but the actions taken to prevent it in this case were not spontaneous ; they were carefully organized and they were sustained by the authority of the State of Arkansas . Integration came about , to the pitiful degree that it did come about , because the President of the United States , in accordance with his inaugural oath , used Federal and federalized troops to enforce the law of the land . Nobody thought that the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in its decision of May 18 , 1954 , would be easy to apply . After taking its stand on the equal rights doctrine of the Fourteenth Amendment , the court delayed for more than a year in issuing an order , and then qualified this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The words were assumed to mean that local conditions should be taken into account , and possibly that the deliberateness rather than Pie speed should be emphasized if the conditions were really " intolerable . " But shall mob actions in the streets outside a school , or continued harassments inside a school , be allowed , unrepressed and unrebuked , to cancel out a decision of our highest court ? Is this what the people of the State of Arkansas or any other state , North or South , really want ? Do they desire a minority to 1. - ule ? We do n't believe so . For , if this were possible in the present instance , what would be left , in any debatable field , of the whole fabric of our constitutional law ? " Deliberate speed " i. , a principle any reasonaJple man , of any race , can accept . Folkways can not be changed overnight . But deliberate nullification , however achieved , can not be accepted in a constitutional democracy .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
