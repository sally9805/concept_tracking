THE SPIDER 'S HOUSE ( 406 pp. ) - Paul Bowles-Random House ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> Novelist Paul Bowles likes to paralyze his characters in the opening pages and then devour them at leisure . The paralytic agents are 20th century emptiness and despair . The devouring usually takes place in North Africa , a nomads ' land where U.S. Novelist Bowles has roved for more than two decades . Like his highly praised The Sheltering Sky and Let It Come Down , the latest Bowles novel is less about the clash of cultures than about the de cline of both West and East . <P> <P> The hero of The Spider 's House is a dilettante culture vulture named John Stenham . In present-day French Morocco , he resents the growing web of tension , intrigue and violence spun by the French and the Arabs . A neutralist esthete in love with his romantic image of the Arabs as a race of noble and religious savages , he does not want the French to keep Morocco or the nationalists to take it . <P> To grey-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom everything is " so exciting , " Stenham looks pretty exciting , but cranky , too . Polly 's head is stuffed with progressive sawdust , but her personality seems to have been forged at U.S. Steel . Her idea of mixing fun and politics is to give an Arab boy enough money to go out and buy himself a revolver . The boy in question is named Amar-cousin to Kipling 's wily quiz kid , Kim . He makes a good deal of The Spider 's House into a kind of child 's garden of Allah . <P> <P> The Spider 's House simmers with the sense of grievance felt by the Arabs against the French . " If you could not have freedom , you could still have vengeance , and that was all anyone really wanted now . " The setting alone lends special interest to the book , and Author Bowles brings the Moroccan locale to life with meticulous realism . If his cast of characters has a cosmetic blush that suggests not the novelist 's but the embalmer 's art , that is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long since learned to enjoy .
