WASHINGTON // 4 // 7 // 14 // 11 // DAVIDSON // 2 // 8 // 9 // 15 // VMI // 2 // 11 // 5 // 13 // Although Coach Fred Schaus is undoubtedly sincere when he says there are three teams beside his own WEST VIRGINIA who " could easily win the championship , " it is most unlikely that anything will keep the Mountaineers from their sixth straight title . Granted , someone may snap their 50-game conference winning streak , but even that is a big order . All-America Jerry West simply dominates the league with his all-round brilliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well and he passes with accuracy and deception . Helping West will be veteran Willie Akers , rookies Paul Miller and Paul Popovich and returning reserves Paul Goode , Joe Posch , Jim Ritchie , Lee Patrone and Nick Visnic . The team should go at least as far as the NCAA quarter-finals next March . Coach Chuck Noe puts himself on the spot at VIRGINIA TECH by insisting that his best-ever squad has no more excuses for losing . Great team speed will enable Tech to employ a three-quarter or half-court press much of the time , an effective luxury to add to its fine shooting and depth . Rugged Chris Smith returns at center , and high-scoring Bob Ayersman ( 26.5 average ) has improved his floor play . They team with Dean Blake to give the front line an output of 52 points per game . Starting Guard Lew Mills returns with reserves Duke Rice and Bill Shepherd , plus three outstanding sophomores , Dave Demarest , John Fleischman and Bucky Keller , THE CITADEL has high hopes , based on the return of four starters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guards Dick Jones , a fine scorer , and Dick Wherry . Center is Coach Norm Sloan 's main worry  --  either Bob Elliott or rookie Keith Stowers , both 6 feet 6 , must do the job . Experienced reserves are George Wehrmeister , Jerry Buchanan and Jerry Records . No other teams appear to be in the same class with the top three , although WILLIAM and MARY will be no pushover , since four starters , led by 6-foot-7 Jeff Cohen , return . Guard Tom Farrington is a double-figure scorer , and front-liners Chuck Sanders and Bev Vaughan are 6 feet 10 and 6 feet 5 , respectively . This big , strong quartet is complemented by Dave Bottoms , Jim Osbon , Dave Fiscella and five sophomores , none of whom , thus far , is pressing the veterans . RICHMOND will have all it can do to match last year 's record . Coach Les Hooker Jr . has a veteran starting lineup but practically no bench . Tom Booker , Art Lambiotte , Carl Slone and Alan Cole return , backed by Lee O'Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The team has some accurate shooters but is hobbled by lack of speed and inadequate rebounding . GEORGE WASHINGTON will look to sophomores for improvement of 1959 's good 14-11 mark . Senior Forward Howie Bash is joined by four rookies : Gar Schweickhardt , Kevin Murphy and the Feldman twins , Jon and Jeff . Dick Markowitz , a junior transfer , is being counted on for much help on a team that hopes to jell by midyear . Des Gatti , Bill Ingram , Ralph Kunze , Jim Walters , Joe Paluck and Larry Usiskin furnish good depth . At FURMAN heavy back-court losses may hurt . Senior Forwards Byron Pinson , Tom Conard and Dag Wilson and Guard Pete Carlisle must carry the burden . At VMI Coach Weenie Miller may start sophomores Norm Halberstadt , Gene Lazaroff and Joe Gedro with veterans Frank Oley and Roy Quinn . He needs more height and depth than is provided by lettermen Jim French and Jerry Lawson , or rookies Weldon Ed-dins and Dick Fravel . At DAVIDSON , too , all hopes rest with the sophomores . Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join veterans Bill Shinn , Ed Stewart and John Huie . Reserves Jim Nuckolls , Bill Cannon , Height Redmond and Joe Markee should help counter the team 's inexperience . // Basketball history continues to be written at TENNESSEE A&amp;I STATE , which won its third consecutive NAIA title last year with a 32-1 record , a 98.8 scoring output and a shooting average well above .500 . Gone are Coach John McLendon and three starters , but Harold Hunter , McLendon 's former assistant , has taken over the coaching duties , and two full teams of talented athletes should sustain the school 's proud tradition . Porter Merriweather , Eugene Werts and Ben Warley lead veterans George Finley , Hillary Brown , Rossie Johnson , Mel Davis and Bob Clark , and rookie Ron Heflin.
