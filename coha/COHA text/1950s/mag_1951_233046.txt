Maurice de Vlaminck used to be one of the " wild beasts " ( fauves ) who in 1905 led the vanguard of modern French art . Nowadays , he enjoys bellowing about the hollowness of it all . Paris painting circles last week were chewing over the latest Vlaminck roars , published in the Paris weekly , Arts . Excerpts : " The capital of France has become an immense flea market . To the connoisseur hoping to find a truly French painting . . . everything new turns out to be old and refurbished . . . Even the fleas are false . " " Mechanical invention reigns in the studios of Montmartre and Montparnasse . Mankind is consumed in making gas explode in cylinders , in making engines turn faster and faster . . . Genuine inspiration is stifled before it can bear fruit . " Negro sculpture , Negro art , jazz , syncopated rhythm , contorted forms , flattened shapes-all this has become a slogan . . . The so-called renaissance of modern art is nothing more than a bastard arrangement of Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite of our civilization , who no longer have anything to say . . . have grasped greedily at the art of these alleged savages . " " Abstract painters have betrayed painting and , after killing it , have shut it up in a cubist coffin . Life today hardly allows one to be a painter . Tomorrow it will be even less so . What is painting today ? An anachronism . " <P> In the midst of all this , Vlaminck last week put 30 of his own latest anachronisms on display in a Paris gallery . They were the same windswept villages and groves , glowering beneath cloudy skies , that he has been painting for the past 35 years . One modern note : beside one of the rutted country roads that Vlaminck loves to paint , the artist had highlighted the shining red pumps and the oval sign of an Esso station .
