txt BRADLEY DELIVERS A PIER ULTIMATUM : PACT OR WALKOUT Head of Old Union Sets Strike for Saturday as Alternative to Negotiating at Once HE WARNS A. F. L. DOCKERS Attacks Meany , Extols Lewis and Holds Stand Justified by Vote in Bargaining By STANLEY LEVEY Capt . William V. Bradley , president of the old International Longshoremen 's Association , issued this public warning yesterday to the New York Shipping Association : Negotiate a contract with us at once or face a strike any time after next Saturday midnight . . The man who succeeded Joseph P. Ryan as leader of the pier group said that he would do everything he could to avoid a port walkout , but that he felt his union was free to strike and would strike if that was the only way to get an agreement . Captain Bradley gave three reasons as justification for his position . One was that the I. L. A. had won a " clear-cut victory " in the union representation election conducted last week by the National Labor Relations Board , giving it the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New ' York . The actual vote was 9,060 for the I. L. A. , 7,568 for the rival American Federation . of Labor dock union and 4,405 ballots challenged . The contested votes have been impounded by the labor board and a decision will be made on them this week . Until the challenges have been disposed of the matter of certification by the board remains up in the air . Condition for Negotiating Captain Bradley 's second reason was that certification was not necessary as a prelude to negotiating . He said there had been an informal agreement that the shipping association would resume contract talks as soon as the labor board named a winner of the vote . This Contention was borne out by a spokesman , for the shipping association who agreed that the employers could negotiate with the winner , but could not sign a contract until there had been certification , either complete or conditional . In preparation for possible collective bargaining conferences , the association 's negotiating committee will meet on Tuesday . Captain Bradley 's third reason was that the Taft-Hardley injunction barring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regarding this he said : " We feel that we are free now to do anything we want to . We plan to fight right down the middle until we get a contract . If we have to strike , we strike , and if we have a strike you can be sure it will be a good one . " There was , however , one other possibility  --  that the labor board might throw out the entire election and order a new one . George Meany , president of the A. F. L. , has indicated that will be the strategy of his organization , and A. F. L. lawyers are expected to file a petition along those lines with the board early this week The federation 's contention is that the entire vote took place in an environment of coercion and intimidation . Warnings and Pledges Given Captain Bradley made several other points and warnings in a four-page statement issued at his office , 265 West Fourteenth Street . Among them were the following : 4A warning to A. F. L. pier union adherents that if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had better " come along withl us " if they hope to keep their jobs on the waterfront . Captain Bradley said there were " 10,000 too many dock workers " and implied I. L. A. men would have first preference for openings . CA promise that any contract negotiated by the L L. A. would contain a strong no-strike clause and that he personally would see to it that it was enforced . He said the wildcat and quickie strikes that have plagued the port for years would be a thing of the past . He would not give details of the machinery of the contemplated nostrike clause , but he suggested that he would revoke the charter 's of locals engaging in illegal walkouts. 4A promise to " police ourselves " - and " put our own house in order . " Captain Bradley said he would bntinued on Faze 63 . Column S BRADLEY DEMANDS CONTRACT ON PIERS // " clean up whatever abuses are proved to exist , " but he made clear that the burden of proof would be on those making the charges . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main by the locals . He would not be drawn into a discussion of specific racketeers and men with past criminal records still powerful in the affairs of the union . Captain Bradley 's statement was equally strong in its praise of John L. Lewis ; president of the United Mine Workers , and in its denunciation of Mr. Meany . Reliance Upon Lewis Of Mr. Lewis , who lent the L L. A. a reported $50,000 , he said : " I want to pay tribute to John L. Lewis  --  the greatest statesman and friend the American labor movement has ever had . This strength of his  --  his courage , his understanding of the common man 's problems  --  has been a symbol of fighting determination for the L L. A. Never did he bow to Taft-Hartley ! " It is my hope that we will one day be affiliated with John L. Lewis . I have not had any indication that the United Mine Workers will accept our affiliation at the present time . However , I know and our men know that no one can accuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When Mr. Lewis ' came to our aid he gave us a charter of good faith , which we were honored and proud to receive in the spirit of genuine friendship and in the thought that we , together , would play a part in the further building of a great labor movement . Lewis has done a magnificent job for the U. M. W. I hope that we may do the same for the L L. A. and all labor . " Of Mr. Meany and his charge of intimidation during the election , Captain Bradley said : " His is the wail of a man who has been dealt a complete defeat . This is the anguished cry of a bad loser . This is the man who accused the N. L. R. B. , according to press reports , of rushing the vote . This is the man who accuses Governor Dewey of a double-cross . This is the man who charges intimidation . This is the man who just spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in a sad attempt to save face for himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bi-state ( waterfront ) law rather than allow a free election . This is the man who sent cut 25,000 telegrams filled with lies and vilifications which will one day come back to haunt him . This is the man who had the opportunity to work constructively on the waterfront but who never even tried . " ? This is the man who tried to deal secretly with us. * * ? " This is the man  --  and mark this well  --  who points the finger of accusation while his own closets can not ' stand the light of day . I ' ask the question : Who is Mr. Meany ? Who made Mr. Meany ? Where is Mr. Meany from ? Who were his associates ? Has Mr. Meany cleaned his own house ? " Union Strategy Session ' Set Captain Bradley said he had summoned members of his union 's Atlantic Coast District executive council to a meeting at union headquarters on Tuesday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock . This group , he added , would plan strategy for resuming negotiation and for a strike if necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloting ' had ended . Captain Bradley promised then that there would be no strike for a ten-day period , during which technical matters growing out of the election could be settled . Many observers have felt it would take more than ten days to resolve some of these questions , but Captain Bradley was insistent that the job be done before next Saturday midnight .
