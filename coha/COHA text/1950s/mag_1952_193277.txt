With Henry Wallace as its presidential candidate , the dusty rose Progressive Party in 1948 got a shade of respectability and a smattering ( 1,156,103 ) of votes . Wallace quit the party soon after Communist aggression in Korea . He now admits that the Communists " made a shambles " out of the Progressive Party . Last week the Progressive headquarters fashioned a 1952 slate that was strictly in shocking pink . <P> As " peace candidate " for President , party bosses-picked Vincent Hallinan , 55 , a California criminal lawyer . After making a $3,000,000 fortune at the bar , Hallinan decided that the law was a " racket " run by the rich , became counsel for West Coast Communists , defended Harry Bridges in the stormy , 81-day perjury trial of 1949-50 . <P> The choice for vice-presidential candidate was dumpy , domineering Mrs. Charlotta Bass , Negro , former Los Angeles publisher , and , until 1940 , a power in California Republican ranks . Childless Mrs. Bass was steered left by a young nephew she adored , became bitterly radical when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited Russia , dined with Ilya Ehrenburg in Moscow . <P> Progressive chiefs blew the usual blasts at U.S. race discrimination , " militarism " and " growing unemployment , " but had nary a hard word against Joe Stalin . <P> Hallinan faced a six-month jail sentence as the U.S. Supreme Court ( see above ) this week refused to review a contempt of court sentence growing out of the Bridges case .
