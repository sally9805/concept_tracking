IF THE first decade of the U. N. was largely dominated by the U. S. , its second decade , which begins next week , promises a very different story . To Mr. Dulles and his U. N. delegate , Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr. , the 1955 session of the General Assembly must seem suddenly to have turned maverick . There was , for one thing , the underestimated Krishna genon and his role as a dens ex machina  --  utilizing the neutralist position to organize new combinations of opposition which Mr. Lodge failed to anticipate . For another , our " solid South , " the Latin Americans , , exhibited an unwonted fickleness . But the ' heaviest blow to U. S. prestige came in the closing days of the session when sixteen new members were voted into the U. N. on conditions defined by Moscow . U. N. " intransigence " had already been demonstrated during November by the marathon vote over a nonpermanent seat on the Security Council . Mr. Lodge 's instructions required him to back , the Philippines . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers and despite the ten-year-old " gentlemen 's agreement " which conceded the seat to Eastern Europe . It was a poor moment for a test of strength . Britain , committed to Yugoslavia , was soon joined by the Communist bloc , as well as the " Bandung powers " and some Latin-American delegates . The subsequent deadlock ran through a record thirty-five ballots in the General Assembly . Yugoslavia and the Philippines ' finally agreed to alternate as occupants of the seat , but this compromise was reached only after the General Assembly , and Security Council had meanwhile accepted a Soviet resolution on the unexpected " package deal " on new members . In all the backstage maneuvering , it was clear that never in U. N. history had U. S. initiative and dexterity been so faltering , if not altogether absent . Some time ' ago thoughtful observers realized that pressure for admission of the exclUded nations could not be contained once cold-war tension began to diminish . Whenever the Russians decided to bargain with their veto in order to seat their own satellites they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless before that time American . diplomacy had won adherents ' to more attractive alternatives . Indeed the present writer pointed out in these columns more than two years ago that the time was late , but not too late , , to reachagreements with a majority of the non-Commu- nist powers on membership questions . The U. S. had , to face the inevitable fact that Red China 's delegates would soon have to be recognized in the U. N. ' on the basis of the principle of universality . It was suggested , therefore , that the U. S. could still work toward a " two-China " compromise , trading the admission of Japan , India or Italy ( or all three ) to the Security Council for Nationalist China 's retirement to the General Assembly  --  where both the Formosan and Peking regimes might be confined until Formosa 's fate could be determined under peaceful international or U. N. auspices . Other and perhaps more practicable possibilities existed . None was pursued . When the Russians called the hour , Mr. Lodge might just as well have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to the " automatic majority " in the U. N. Before i the Bandung conference the U. S. might have won the support of some of the newly chosen Asian states but by now they have been committed on key questions to Asian-Arab-African solidarity , largely under Indian influence . Chiang Kaishek 's use of the veto against Outer Mongolia has all ' but ended his pretensions to represent China . It will take adroit U. S. manipulating to get his credentials accepted in the next General Assembly . After that he will be lucky to retain a seat even as the governor of Formosa . Mr. Dulles must'also accept responsibility for the situation which now compels the U. S. either to admit Outer Mongolia and Red China to the U. N. or be resigned to the exclusion of Japan  --  and continued heavy Soviet pressure to drive Japan into a neutralist corner . Aside from the extraordinary lack of U. S. policy and tactical planning exposed by the U. N. " revolt , " it may also be looked upon . as a reflection of post-Geneva convictions among iron-atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen war has'greatly diminished . After long-suffering silence they may new take delight in the luxury of , asserting independent opinions . But opposition to the U. S. in the U. N. probably goes beyond that . It may be an expression of various degrees of disappointment or even boredom with certain static American attitudes toward the world 's peacetime needs for change . Three or four events of the past month ilalustrate how insensible we are to dramatic new facts in this kost revolutionary era of human history , and how far we are sometinac4 front tradem.tancling ' the audimikd of the nations which Senator Knowland expects loyally to follow Republican leadership . Take the General Assembly 's approval of the self-determination article proposed for the U. N. Covenant  --  and debated for a full month ( after six years of committee discussion ) before the voting . Mr. Dulles 's deputy had all along vehemently opposed it . The argument in our case significantly differed from that of the major colonial powers , our-NATO allies . It is not that we deny that " all peoples have the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , for their own ends , freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources " etc. was judged inadmissable by the U. S. In effect this means to reject the principle that a nation may nationalize or socialize privately'owned property at the people 's will . The vote of 33 to 12 put the U. S. in a minority in favor of old assumptions which - colonial powers themselves disavow at home . , Then there was the case of Mr. Dulles and his gratui-touw aid to Tovarish Khrushchev , about which the Nation has already commented ( December 17 ) . The reference is of course to Mr. Dulles ' choice of Dr. Paulo . Cunhua  --  of all people ! ? as the appropriate person with whom to associate U. S. policy in denouncing the " Soviet leaders now visiting Asia . " By lending moral support to what he called " the Portuguese provinces in the Far East " Mr. Dulles helped confirm Khrushchev 's distorted image of United States " imperialism . " Asians did not fail to draw the inference that the U. S. recognizes not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other colonial holdings on that continent  --  as mere " provinces " of Europe . NOW , observe one or two other events which have nothing to do directly with foreign policy . In the state of Georgia ? U. S. A. , not U. S. S. R. ? Governor Griffin called upon his board of regents to cancel a ball game between Georgia Tech and Pittsburgh because there was a Negro on the Pittsburgh team . After " prayerfully considering , " the , Georgia regents ruled in favor of total segregation in all future ball games held in states where segregation is law or custom.There is also the current attempt of the Virginia legislature to set the clock back by abolishing its proud and ancient public-school system , rather than tolerate coeducation with colored children as decreed by the Supreme Court . Such disparate facts are part of a general pattern of attitudes toward matters of human rights versus property rights , and of race and skin color , which has done the U. S. enormous harm  --  in the U. N. It is n't that there are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that violations of human dignity far more evil do n't exist behind the iron curtain . It is simply that ever since the establishment of U. N. headquarters here , and our avowed claims to " leadership of the free world , " this country and all its behavior has been under the harsh revealing light of world scrutiny and comparison . Can we as a nation consistently champion . " self-determination " in Eastern Europe , yec insist that fa.nguishing colonies held as enclaves on one continent are really " provinces " of a country on another continent ? Are we entitled to lecture older nations on international tolerance and cooperation when we have not yet overcome racial bigotry nor eliminated color discrimination as matters of official policy here at home ? In the past we commanded an " automatic majority " in the U. N. partly because of our dreaded thunderbolts ; that monopoly has been broken . We commanded it also because of America 's vast wealth and technological brilliance ; but Europe has now recovered from its wounds . Technologically , Russia is drawing abreast of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded a following because of our capacity to aid , and our unparalleled generosity in aiding ; and for this we are still nat forgotten by the poor and the weak . But ' the moral-political ascendancy we briefly held everywhere following World War II has now been largely dissipated  --  much of it lost under darkest McCarthyism . In those years the Great Doubt spread and deepened as the Administration stood immobilized while the world watched the spectacle of free men  --  including Cabinet members from Mr. Dulles down  --  tremble and appease the legions of primitive witchcraft lined up behind a cynical U. S. Senator and schoolboy clowns like Cohen and Schine . WHILE AMERICA 's easy dominance of the U. N. ends with 1955 , still the loss need not mean catastrophe for ourselves or the organization . In the new U. N. ? the U. N. of the seventy-six rather than the sixty nations  --  we shall need policies embodying far greater foresight and flexibility if we are to recover a forward-looking posture in the world . Now it is clear to all that U. N. membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the principle of universality . We helped bring this about by allying ourselves with any regime ready to verbalize support for our side in the cold war . This led us to the point where Dulles not only embraced Franco but sponsored him for U. N. membership . Just as logically it sent Russia 's foremost potentates on a courting tour of India and Burma , where the philosophy and leading personalities of existing regimes are profoundly despised by all true followers of Lenin and Stalin . Secondly , the dark-skinned nations in the U. N. now have acquired a strength which must cammand a new respect from all major military powers and ideological rivals . If necessary they may impose a plague on both houses of the mighty . Existing Asian-AfriCan members have been reinforced by Jordan , Libya , Nepal , Ceylon , Cambodia and Laos . They constitute the largest re-gional bloc  --  twenty-three nations  --  of votes . Nor is this the end . Even before Outer Mongolia , Japan , Korea and Vietnam enter the General Assembly , the Gold-Coast , Morocco , Khartoum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new permanent seat in the Security Council for one or more . Asian states now The N-moisi becomes mandatory to reflect the new color composi-ti on tion of the U. N. ? and the world . Thirdly , the Latin-American vote , reduced to a quarter of the total U. N. poll but augmented as a linguistic bloc by the admission of Spain . Italy and Portugal , may drift farther away from , rather than closer toward , the U. S. All kinds of deals become possible . The Asian-Arab-African combination and the Latin Americans between them still hold a majority . Even more significant , the Asian-African bloc now needs only the enlarged Communist vote ( nine powers strong ) , plus six independent votes , to Make another majority . Among the new candidateS only Spain , Portugal and possibly Italy may be relied upon to vote with the U. S. on any colonial issue . Fourthly , the next U. N. decade may belong neither to the U. S. nor the U. S. S. R. but to powers capable of exploiting antagonisms between them , Certainly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buyers ' , market of seemingly unlimited credit for the geographically and ' politically in-between powers . They can hear bids from either side and  --  as in the case of India  --  take from both . But if the decade starts as the heyday of the neutralists , it can remain thus only as long as the general peace is kept . Given the colonial condition of most of Africa , the semi-colonial condition of much of Asia , South America and Eastern Europe , and the Soviet Union 's new " perimeter-jumping tactics " to encourage nationalist and class wars away from her own borders , it would be surprising if the next ten years do not see a series of rebellions and revolutions . Will the U. S. be able consistently to cling to the position that suppression of civil war or colonial " provincial " revolt is a " purely internal ' affair " under any and all circumstances ? Or will we try to persuade the U. N. to assume greater and . greater authority  --  and thus submit ourselves , also , to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left aside , one thing seems certain . The answers provided by the U. N. 's second decade , the decade just beginning , . wo n't be the answers of anybody 's " automatic majority . " And believers in democracy can not but welcome this as a sign of growing strength and maturity in responsible internationalism . The Shape of Things The Satellite Sector In addition to Mr. Wiles ' article on p. 574 of this issue , much light is thrown on the ability of the Soviets to play the role of the basic provider of industrial equipment for such projects as the Aswan Dam by a report appearing in the October issue of The World Today . Despite its own dynamic industrialization , the Soviet Union is primarily the supplier of raw materials , food , and fuel in trade exchanges with the East European satellites . Indeed , the Soviet Union is a December 31 , 1955 net importer of equipment from this area . As against $600-$700,000,000 worth of machinery imported in 1953 from the Communist area , the U. S. S. it . imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite clear , therefore , that in strategic terms the Soviet Union is relying heavily on the industrial capacity and know-how of its East European satellites to make good its commitments to China , North Korea , Mongolia , and other Asian and Middle Eastern underdeveloped areas . There is , it should be noted , a highly effective specialization in the East European economies : Hungary in diesel locomotives and electrical apparatus , Poland in rolling stock and ocean-going ships , Czechoslovakia in machine tools ( the industrial production of the Czechs has doubled since World War II ) . But it is interesting to note that although the Czechs made a net con.tribution to the intra-bloc pool of about $700-$800,000,000 , the East Germany contribution in industrial products is even higher . Not only does this report shed considerable light on the Soviet Union 's ability to make good on its commitments but it casts an even more revealing light on its political preoccupation with East Germany and the satellite countries . Any relaxation of the ideological cold war might , frdra the Soviet point of view , endanger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't Call Me Moses " The slate of candidates pledged to oppose the blacklist sponsored by the organization AWARE has won a resounding victory in the battle for control of the'New York local of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ( see : The Nat &on,?eptember; 3 , 1955 ) . Of thirty-five vacancies on the board , the insurgent anti-blacklisters have won twenty-seven and possibly twenty-nine positions ( the ballots have not been fully tabulated ) . Impressed by this outstanding victory for decency and fair play we asked John Henry Faulk , spokesman for the winning middle-of-the-road slate , just hoW he would account for the upsurge of democratic strength in a union that seemed to have knuckled under to intimidation and job coercion . Mr. Faulk , who is that rare bird , a native Texan with a sense of moderation , told us that he had two outstanding impressions of the election : ( 1 ) that a widespread , blind , unreasoning fear of retaliation had inhibited the middleof-the-roaders from voicing their abhorrence of blacklists prior to the elections but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the extreme - Left  --  once their basic convictions had been appealed to by leadership elements in whom they had confidence . This , it seems to us , is a parable to be noted by all Americans and in particular by the New York locals of the American Newspaper Guild . When we offered our congratulations to Mr. Faulk for a victory to which his own leadership had contributed , he replied : " Do n't call me Moses . " This too is the spirit in which all such congratulations should be acknoWledged . Loans for Christmas The rejection by Westinghouse Electric of proposals submitted by three governors ? Averell Harriman of NeW York , Theodore McKeldin of Maryland and George Leader of Pennsylvania  --  to arbitrate the strike of 50,000 workers at forty of the company 's ninety-eight plants which began on October 17 , is a measure of management 's confidence in victory : A similar indication of confidence is the offer of $1,500,000 in $100 Christmas loans to striking employees ; thousands of strikers , with union approval , have been crossing picket lines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christmas " proposal is a welcome change from the " starve ' em out " type of industrial warfare . In the wake of management 's rejection of the arbitration proposals , the Department of Justice moved to have the independent U. E. ? one of the striking unions  --  branded as " Communist-dominated " in a proceeding ' initiated before the Subversive Activities Control Board . The fact that U. E. is currently negotiating with the I. U. E. ? the other striking union  --  for some type of consolidation or merger may help to explain the timing of this action . The strike has a complex background ( see " The Westinghouse Strike " by William JacobS , The Nation , November 19 , 1955 ) but the issues which precipitated it , have now been subordinated to the larger question : will the recently united labor movement permit thisstrike to be lost ? The conflict could have been settled weeks ago if certain ' A. F. of L. unions , notably the Teamsters , had supported the strikers . Duncan .
