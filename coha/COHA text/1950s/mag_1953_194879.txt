The three-year-old Republic of Indonesia , which got its independence from the Dutch before it was ready for it , has a constitution ( provisional ) and an army ( provisional ) . It has never had a general election . An election might make Indonesia more stable-if Indonesia were stable enough to hold an election . <P> One man who thought something should be done about this state of near-anarchy is handsome Hamengku Buwono , 40 , Sultan of Jogjakarta and Indonesia 's Defense Minister . A 24-carat Sultan with an impeccable anti-Dutch background and the strongest man in the government , he decided to pull together at least one corner of the disorganized fabric : the army . The Indonesian army is an unwieldy , unreliable mob of 250,000 poorly armed , badly disciplined ex-guerrillas who grabbed guns to fight the Dutch , stayed on as " soldiers . " Enthusiastically backed by his professional high command , the Sultan ordered unfit ex-guerrillas dismissed and the army slimmed into a disciplined , modernized , Western-style force . <P> Three of its seven divisions promptly revolted against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance to the chief of state , President Achmad Soekarno . Regiments fought within themselves and against each other . <P> Confronted with this rebellion , the weak government fired the Sultan 's pros , promoted the insurgents , and virtually handed them the army . Overwhelmed by futility , the Sultan last week resigned . History , he said , would judge whether he had been right .
