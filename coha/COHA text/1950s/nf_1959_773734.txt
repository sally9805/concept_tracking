txt // 159 . Classical and medieval notions of labor . The Greeks and Romans regarded all labor for gain as degrading . The Greeks seem to have reached this opinion through a great esteem for intellectual pursuits , which they thought means of cultivation . The gainful occupations , or any occupations pursued for gain , were " banausic , " which meant that they had an effect opposite to that of cultivation . The Romans seem to have adopted the Greek view , but they were prepared for it by militarism . The Middle Ages got the notion of labor from the Roman tradition . They mixed this with the biblical view . Labor was a necessity , as a consequence and penalty of sin , and directly connected , as a curse , with the Fall . " It was correlative to a curse on the ground , by which , also as a curse for sin , it was made hard to win subsistence by agriculture . The mediaeval philosophers , being clerics , held a life of contemplation to be far superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evil necessity , a hardship , a symptom of the case of man , alienated from God and toiling to get back , if there was a way to get back , to the kingdom of God . The church offered a way to get back , namely , by sacraments , devotion , ritual , etc. , that is , by a technically religious life , which could be lived successfully only if practiced exclusively . It occupied all the time of the " religious , " technically so called . Labor was used for penance and for ascetic purposes . Often it was employed for useful results and with beneficial effect on useful arts . The purpose , however , was to ward off the vices of leisure . The ascetic temper and taste made labor sweet , so long as asceticism ruled the mores of the age . ' Labor for economic production was not appreciated by the church . The production of wealth was not a religious purpose . It was even discouraged , since disapproval of wealth and luxury was one of the deep controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy appeared most distinctly in the views of marriage and labor , the two chief interests of everyday life . Marriage was a concession , a compromise with human weakness . There was something better , viz. celibacy . Labor was a base necessity . Contemplation was better . Footnote 160 . Labor has always existed . Wealth became possible . Land . In all these cases the view of labor was dogmatic . It was enjoined by religion . There was some sense and truth in each view , but each was incomplete . The pursuit of gainful effort is as old as the existence of man on earth . The development of trade and transportation , slavery , political security , and the invention of money and credit are steps in it which have made possible large operations , great gains , and wealth . Some men have seized these chances and have made a powerful class . Rulers , chiefs , and medicine men have observed this power which might either enhance or supplant their own , and have sought to win it . In all primitive agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large annual revenue for comfort and power . The mediaeval people of all classes got as much of it as they could . It would be very difficult indeed to mention any time when there were no rich men , and still harder to mention a time when the power of wealth was not admired and envied , and given its sway ( sec. 150 ) . Thus the religions and philosophies may have preached various doctrines about wealth , and may have found obedience , but the production of wealth , the love of wealth , and the power of wealth have run through all human history . The religions and philosophies have not lacked their effect , but they have always had to compromise with facts , just as we see them do to-day . The compromise has been in the mores . In so far as it was imperfect and only partly effected there have been contradictions in the mores . Such was the case in the Middle Ages . Wealth had great power . It at ' last won the day . In the fifteenth century all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . Venality became the leading trait of the mores of the age . It affected the interpretation of the traditional doctrines of labor , wealth , the highest good , and of virtue , so that men of high purpose and honest hearts were carried away while professing disre 4of wealth and luxury . Modern n view of labor . It is only in the most recent times , and imperfectly as yet , that labor has been recognized as a blessing , or , at worst , as a necessity which has great moral and social compensations , and which , if rightly understood and // wisely used , brings joy and satisfaction . This can only be true , however , when labor is crowned by achievement , and that is when it is productive of wealth . Labor for the sake of labor is sport . It has its limits , and lies outside of the struggle for existence , which is real , and is not play . Labor in the struggle for existence is irksome and painful , and is never happy or reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decry wealth is to multiply absurdities . The modern man is set in a new dilemma . The father labors , wins , and saves that his son may have wealth and leisure . Only too often the son finds his inheritance a curse . Where is the error ? Shall the fathers renounce their labors ? 162 . Movable capital in modern society . Conditions of equality . Present temporary status of the demand for men . In modern times movable capital has been immensely developed and even fixed capital has been made mobile by the joint-stock device . It has disputed and largely defeated the social power of land property . It has become the social power . While land owners possessed the great social advantage , they could form a class of hereditary nobles . The nobles now disappear because their social advantage is gone . The modern financiers , masters of industry , merchants , and transporters now hold control of movable capital . They hold social and political power . They have not yet formed a caste of nobles , but they may do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old nobility and limit their marriages further to their own set . It is thus that classes form and reform , as new groups in the society get possession of new elements of social power , because power produces results . The dogmas of philosophers deal with what ought to be . What is and shall be is determined by the forces at work . No forces appear which make men equal . Temporary conditions occur under which no forces are at work which any one can seize upon . Then no superiority tells , and all are approximately equal . Such conditions exist in a new colony or state , or whenever the ratio of population to land is small . If we take into account the reflex effect of the new countries on Europe , it is easy to see that the whole civilized world has been under these conditions for the last two hundred or three hundred years . The effect of the creation of an immense stock of movable capital , of the opportunities in commerce and industry offered to men of talent , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening of new continents and the peopling of them by the poorest and worst in Europe , has been to produce modern mores . All our popular faiths , hopes , enjoyments , and powers are due to these great changes in the conditions of life . The new status makes us believe in all kinds of rosy doctrines about human welfare , and about the struggle for existence and the competition of life ; it also gives us all our contempt for old-fashioned kings and nobles , creates democracies , and brings forth new social classes and gives them power . For the time being things are so turned about that numbers are a source of power . Men are in demand , and an increase in their number increases their value . Why then should we not join in dithyrambic oratory , and set all our mores to optimism ? The reason is because the existing status is temporary and the conditions in it are evanescent . That men should be in demand mn the earth is a temporary and passing status of the conjuncture which makes things now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , however , will not arrest the optimism , the self-confidence , the joy in life , and the eagerness for the future , of the masses of to-day . 163 . Effect of the facility of winning wealth . All the changes in conditions of life in the last four hundred years have refashioned the mores and given modern society new ideas , standards , codes , philosophies , and religions . Nothing acts more directly on the mores than the facility with which great numbers of people can accumulate wealth by industry . If it is difficult to do so , classes become fixed and stable . Then there will be an old and stiff aristocracy which will tolerate no upstarts , and other classes will settle into established gradations of dependence . The old Russian boyars were an example of such an aristocracy . Certain medival cities ran into this form . In it the mores of conservatism are developed ,  --  unchangeable manners , fixed usages and ideas , unenlightenment , refusal of new ideas , subserviency of the lower classes , and sycophancy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily possible to gain wealth , a class of upstart rich men arises who , in a few years , must be recognized by the aristocracy , because they possess financial power and are needed . Struggles and civil wars may occur , as in the Italian cities , during this change , and the old aristocracy may long hold aloof from the new . In time , the new men win their way . The history of every state in Europe proves it . Old fortunes decay and old families die out . The result is inevitable . Laws and institutions can not prevent it . Certain mores may have been recognized as aristocratic and there may be lamentations over their decline . They are poetic , romantic , and adventurous . Therefore they call out regret for their loss from those who do not think what would come back with them if they were recalled . Ethical philosophers may see ample reason to doubt the benefit of new mores and the vulgarization of everything . Society can not stand still , and its movement will run the course set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted and profit must be drawn from it , as best possible . 164 . Chances of acquiring wealth in modern times ; effect on modern mores ; speculation involved in any change . The effect of the opening of new continents , the application of new inventions , and the expansion of commerce has been to make it easy for men with suitable talent to increase wealth . These changes have cheapened all luxuries , that is , have reduced them to common necessities . They have made land easily accessible to all , even the poorest , in the new countries , while lowering rent in old countries . They have raised wages and raised the standard of living and comfort . They have lessened the competition of life throughout civilized nations , and have made the struggle for existence far less severe . It is the changes in life conditions which have made slavery impossible and extended humanitarian sympathy . They have lessened social differentiation ( that is , they have democratized ) , and they have intensified the industrial organization . In detail , and for individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional and semiprofessional classes it has been made harder to keep up the externals of a certain social position . For those classes the standard of living has // risen faster than steam has cheapened luxuries . Discontent , anxiety , care for appearances , desire to impose by display , envy , and mean social ambition characterize the mores , together with energy and enterprise . Envy and discontent are amongst the very strongest traits of modern society . Very often they are only manifestations of irritated vanity . It is in the nature of things that classes of men and forms of property shall go through endless vicissitudes of advantage and disadvantage . Nobody can foresee these and speculate upon them with success . When it is proposed to reorganize society " on any socialistic theory , or on no theory , it should be noticed that such an enter-prise involves a blind speculation on the vicissitudes of classes and forms of property in the future . " Wealth , whether in land or money , has been increased by marriages and inheritances , reduced to fragments by divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entails , dissipated by prodigals , recon-stituted by men of economical habits , centupled by industrious and competent men of enterprise , scattered by the indolent , the unfortunate , and the men of bad judgment , who have risked it un-wisely . Political events have affected it as well as the favor of princes , advantageous offices in the state , popular revolts , wars , confiscations , from the abolition of serfdom in the fourteenth century until the abolition , in 1790 , of the dues known as feudal , although they were , for the most part , owned by members of the bourgeoisie. " 1 So it will be in the future , in spite of all that men can do . If two men had the same sum of money in 1200 , and one bought land while the other became a money lender , anywhere in western Europe , the former would to-day be more or less rich according to the position of his land . He might be a great millionaire . The other would have scarcely anything left.2 Shall we then all buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of values in the next seven hundred years . The popular notion is that nobles have always owned land . The truth is that men who have acquired wealth have bought land and got themselves ennobled . In France , " in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , nineteen twentieths of those who were 1 66 FOLKWAYS called nobles were middle-class men enriched , decorated , and possessed of land . " 1 The middle class in western Europe has been formed out of the labor class within seven hundred years . The whole middle class , therefore , represents the successful rise of the serfs , but , since a labor class still remains , it is asserted that there has been no change . On the other hand , there has been a movement of nobles and middle-class grandees downward into the labor class and the proletariat . It was said , a few years ago , that a Plantagenet was a butcher in a suburb of London . It is also asserted that representatives of great medi-eval families are now to be found as small farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 165 . Mores conform to changes in life conditions ; great prin-ciples ; their value and fate . For our purpose it suffices here to notice how the mores have followed the changes in life condi-tions , how they have reacted on the current faiths and philoso-phies , and how they have produced ethical notions to justify the mores themselves . They have produced notions of natural rights and of political philosophy to support the new institutions . There are thousands in the United States who believe that every adult male has a natural right to vote , and that the vote makes the citizen . The doctrine of natural rights has received some judicial recognition , and it has been more or less accepted and applied in the constitutions of various states which were estab-lished in the nineteenth century . The American doctrines of 1776 and the French doctrines of 1789 are carried on and used in stump oratory until they get in the way of some new popular purpose , but what produced both was the fact that some new classes had won wealth and economic power and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invent some new " great principles " to justify their revolt against tradition . That is the way in which all " great principles " are produced . They are always made for an exigency . Their usefulness passes with the occasion . The mores are forever adjusting efforts to circum-stances . Sooner or later they need new great principles . Then // they obliterate the old ones . The old jingle of words no longer wins a response . The doctrine is dead . In 1776 it seemed to every Whig in America that it was a pure axiom to say that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed . They clung to this as a sacred dogma for over a hundred years , because it did not affect unfavorably any interest . It is untrue . Governments get their powers from the historical fact of their existence . They are all ephemeral , subject to change . When a change takes place it is controlled by the ideas and interests of the time of change , when the popular element in self-government may be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1898 the popular will , in the United States , was to take possession of the Philippine Islands and to become rulers there , not ruled , as the fathers were in the colonies of 1776 . The great doctrine of the source of due power was quickly trampled under foot . The same fate awaits all the rest of the " great principles . " The doctrine that all men are equal is being gradually dropped , from its inherent absurdity , and we may at any time find it expedient to drop the jingle about a government of the people , by the people , and for the people . It was only good historically to destroy the doctrine , " Everything for the people ; nothing by them . " 166 . The French Revolution . The French Revolution was due to the fact that a great change had come about in the distribution of economic power between classes and in the class mores which correspond to economic power . All the political institutions of a modern state are conservative in the sense that they retain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or change . The historical picture is often such that abuses are maintained and reform seems hopeless , on account of the power of existing institutions and customs and the depth of convictions of social welfare which have become traditional . The student of the history is led to believe that any reform or revolution , as a dissolution of the inherited system of repression and retention , is worth all that it may cost . Hence some students of history become believers in " revolution " as a beneficent social force or engine . In the case of the French Revolution , 1 68 FOLKWAYS the passions which were set loose destroyed the whole social order , swept away all the institutions , and even destroyed all the inherited mores . It is evident that this last is what the revolutionists finally aimed at . The ancien regime came to mean the whole fabric of the old society , with its codes , standards , and ideas of right , wrong , the desirable , etc . The revolutionists also undertook to invent new mores , that is , new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new religion , and new notions of civil duty and responsibility . During the Directory and the Consulate there was a gulf between the ancient and the new in which there was anarchy of the mores , even after the civil machinery was repaired and set in operation again . Napoleon brought back institutions and forms of social order so far as seemed desirable for his own interest . The historical continuity was broken and has remained so . Of the ancien regime there can be found to-day only ruins and relics . Nevertheless , the ancient mores of social faith and morality , of social well living , of religious duty and family virtue , are substantially what they were before the great explosion . This is the last and greatest lesson of the revolution : it is impossible to abolish the mores and to replace them by new ones rationally invented . To change a monarchy into a republic is trifling . Individuals and classes can be guillotined . Institutions can be overturned . Religion can be abolished or put out of fashion . The mores are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practiced every day . The revolutionists ordered changes in the social ritual , and they brought about a disuse of monsieur " and madame . " All their innovations in the ritual have fallen into disuse , and the old fashions have returned , in obedience to common sense . The new classes have not enjoyed their victory over the old as to courtesy , social comity , and civil good-fellowship . They have abandoned it , and have recognized the fact that the old aristocracy had well solved all matters of this kind . As wealth has increased and artisans and peasants have gained new powers of production and acquisition , they have learned to laugh at the civil philosophy and enthusiasm of the eighteenthcentury philosophers , and have ordered their lives , as far as // possible or convenient , on the old aristocratic models . Sansculottism is inconsistent with respect for productive labor , or with the accumulation of wealth . No one who can earn great wages or who possesses wealth will , out of zeal for philosophical doctrines , prefer to live in squalor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect to labor and trade , and to the accumulation of wealth , are to be easily perceived from the course of modern revolutions . 167 . Ruling classes . Special privileges . Corruption of the mores . In every societal system or order there must be a ruling class or classes ; in other words , a class gets control of any society and determines its political form or system . The ruling class , therefore , has the power . Will it not use the power to divert social effort to its own service and gain ? It must be expected to do so , unless it is checked by institutions which call into action opposing interests and forces . There is no class which can be trusted to rule society with due justice to all , not abusing its power for its own interest . The task of constitutional government is to devise institutions which shall come into play at the critical periods to prevent the abusive control of the powers of a state by the controlling classes in it . The ruling classes in mediaeval society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to aggrandize themselves at the expense of other classes . Modern society is ruled by the middle class . In honor of the bourgeoisie it must be said that they have invented institutions of civil liberty which secure to all safety of person and property . They have not , therefore , made a state for themselves alone or chiefly , and their state is the only one in which no class has had to fear oppressive use of political power . The history of the nineteenth century , however , plainly showed the power of capital in the modern state . Special legislation , charters , and franchises proved to be easy legislative means of using the powers of the state for the pecuniary benefit of the few . In the first half of the century , in the United States , banks of issue were used to an extravagant pitch for private interest . The history is disgraceful , and it is a permanent degradation of popular government that power could not be found , or did not exist , in the 1 70 FOLKWAYS system to subjugate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The protective-tariff system is simply an elaborate system by which certain interests inside of a country get control of legislation in order to tax their fellow-citizens for their own benefit . Some of the victims claim to be taken " into the steal , " and if they can make enough trouble for the clique in power , they can force their own admission . That only teaches all that the great way to succeed in the pursuit of wealth is to organize a steal of some kind and get inside of it . The pension system in the United States is an abuse which has escaped from control . There is no longer any attempt to cope with it . It is the share of the " common man " in the great system of public plunder . Graft " is only a proof of the wide extent to which this lesson to get into the steal is learned . It only shows that the corrupt use of legislation and political power has affected the mores . Every one must have his little sphere of plunder and especial advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all new legislation . The legislators do not doubt that it is reasonable and right to enact laws which provide favor for special interests , or to practice legislative strikes on insurance companies , railroads , telephone companies , etc . They laugh at remonstrance as out of date and " unpractical . " The administrators of life-insurance companies , savings banks , trusts , etc. , proceed on the belief that men in positions of power and control will use their positions for their own advantage . They think that that is only common sense . " What else are we here for ? " It is the supreme test of a system of government whether its machinery is adequate for repressing the selfish undertakings of cliques formed on special interests and saving the public from raids of plunderers . The modern democratic states fail under this test . There is not a great state in the world which was not democratized in the nineteenth century . There is not one of them which did not have great financial scandals before the century closed . Financial scandal is the curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They give liberty and security , with open chances for individual enterprise , from which results great individual // satisfaction and happiness , but the political machinery offers opportunities for manipulation and corrupt abuse . They educate their citizens to seek advantages in the industrial organization by legislative devices , and to use them to the uttermost . The effect is seen in the mores . We hear of plutocracy and tainted money , of the power of wealth , and the wickedness of corporations . The disease is less specific . It is constitutional . The critics are as subject to it as the criticised . A disease of the mores is a disease of public opinion as to standards , codes , ideas of truth and right , and of things worth working for and means of success . Such a disease affects everybody . It penetrates and spoils every institution . It spreads from generation to generation , and at last it destroys in the masses the power of ethical judgment . 168 . The standard of living . One of the purest of all the products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to a subgroup and is a product of the mores of a subgroup . It has been called a psychological or ethical product , which view plainly is due to an imperfect analysis or classification . The standard of living is the measure of decency and suitability in material comfort ( diet , dress , dwelling , etc. ) which is traditional and habitual in a subgroup . It is often wise and necessary to disregard the social standard of comfort , because it imposes foolish expenses and contemptible ostentation , but it is very difficult to disregard the social standard of comfort . The standard is upheld by fear of social disapproval , if one derogates from class " respectability . " The disapproval or contempt of one 's nearest associates is the sanction . The standards and code of respectability are in the class mores . They get inside of the mind and heart of members of the class , and betray each to the class demands . 169 . If , however , the standard of living which one has inherited from his class is adopted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort and self-denial , the individual and social results are of high value . One man said , " Live like a hog and you will behave like one " ; to which another replied , " Behave like a hog and you will live like one . " Both were right in about // equal measure . The social standard of a class acts like honor . It sustains self-respect and duty to self and family . The pain which is produced by derogation produces effort and selfdenial . The social standard may well call out and concentrate all there is in a man to work for his social welfare . Evidently the standard of living never can do more than that . It never can add anything to the forces in a man 's own character and attainments. 170 . Social selection by the mores . The most important fact about the mores is their dominion over the individual . Arising he knows not whence or how , they meet his opening mind in 173 // earliest childhood , give him his outfit of ideas , faiths , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They bring to him codes of action , standards , and rules of ethics . They have a model of the man-as-he-should-be to which they mold him , in spite of himself and without his knowledge . If he submits and consents , he is taken up and may attain great social success . If he resists and dissents , he is thrown out and may be trodden under foot . The mores are therefore an engine of social selection . Their coercion of the individual is the mode in which they operate the selection , and the details of the process deserve study . Some folkways exercise an unknown and unintelligent selection . Infanticide does this ( Chapter VII ) . Slavery always exerts a very powerful selection , both physical and social ( Chapter VI ) . 171 . Instrumentalities of suggestion . Suggestion is exerted in the mores by a number of instrumentalities , all of which have their origin in the mores , and may only extend to all what some have thought and felt , or may ( at a later stage ) be used with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myths , legends , fables , and mythology spread notions through a group , and from generation to generation , until the notions become components of the mores , being interwoven with the folkways . Epic poems have powerfully influenced the mores . They present types of heroic actions and character which serve as models to the young . The Iliad and Odyssey became text-books for the instruction of Greek youth . They set notions of heroism and duty , and furnished all Greeks with a common stock of narratives , ideas , and ideals , and with sentiments which everybody knew and which could be rearoused by an allusion . Everybody was expected to produce the same reaction under the allusion . Perhaps that was a conventional assumption , and the reaction in thought and feeling may have been only conventional in many cases , but the suggestion did not fail of its effect even then . Later , when the ideals of epic heroism and of the old respect for the gods were popularly rejected and derided , this renunciation of the old stock of common ideas and faiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a very important question : What is the effect of conventional humbug in the mores of a people , which is suggested to the young as solemn and sacred , and which they have to find out and reject later in life ? The Mahabharata , the Kalevala , the Edda , the Nibelnngen Noth , are other examples of popular epics which had great influence on the mores for centuries . Such poems present models of action and principle , but it is inevitable that a later time will not appreciate them and will turn them to ridicule , or will make of them only poses and affectations . The former is the effect most likely to be produced on the masses , the latter on the cultured classes . In the Greco-Roman world , at the beginning of the Christian era , various philosophic sects tried to restore and renew the ideals of Greek heroism , virtue , and religious faith , so far as they seemed to have permanent ethical value . The popular mores were never touched by this effort . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Seneca , Plutarch , Marcus Aurelius , Epictetus , and Pliny represent to us the real rules of life of those men , or are only a literary pose . In the Renaissance , and since then , men educated in the classics have been influenced by them in regard to their standards of noble and praiseworthy character , and of what should be cultivated in thought and conduct . Such men have had a common stock of quotations , of accepted views in life philosophy , and of current ethical opinions . This stock , however , has been common to the members of the technical guild of the learned . It has never affected the masses . Amongst Protestants the Bible has , in the last four hundred years , furnished a common stock of history and anecdote , and has also furnished phrases and current quotations familiar to all classes . It has furnished codes and standards which none dared to disavow , and the suggestion of which has been overpowering . The effect on popular mores has been very great . 172 . Symbols , pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed in the form of symbols to carry suggestion . Symbolic acts were employed in trade and contracts , in marriage and religion . For us writing has taken the place of 1 76 FOLKWAYS symbols as a means of suggestion . Symbols do not appeal to us . They are not in our habits . Illustrative pictures influence us . The introduction of them into daily newspapers is an important development of the arts of suggestion . Mediaeval art in colored glass , carving , sculpture , and pictures reveals the grossness and crass simplicity of the mediaval imagination , but also its childish originality and directness . No doubt it was on account of these latter characteristics that it had such suggestive power . It was graphic . It stimulated and inflamed the kind of imagination which produced it . It found its subjects in heaven , hell , demons , torture , and the scriptural incidents which contained any horrible , fantastic , or grotesque elements . The crucifix represented a man dying in the agony of torture , and it was the chief symbol of the religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sensuality . Any one who , in childhood , had in his hands one of the old Bibles illustrated by wood cuts knows what power the cuts had to determine the concept which was formed from the text , and which has persisted through life , in spite of later instruction . 173 . Apparatus of suggestion . In modern times the apparatus of suggestion is in language , not in pictures , carvings morality plays , or other visible products of art . Watchwords catchwords , phrases , and epithets are the modern instrumentalities . There are words which are used currently as if their meaning was perfectly simple , clear , and unambiguous , which are not defined at all . " Democracy , " the " People , " " Wall Street , " Slave , " " Americanism , " are examples . These words have been called " symbols . " They might better be called " tokens " They are like token coins . They " pass " ; that is their most noteworthy characteristic . They are familiar , unquestioned , popular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always reveal the invincible tendency of the masses to mythologize . They are personified and a superhuman energy is attributed to them . " Democracy " is not treated as a parallel word to aristocracy , theocracy , autocracy , etc. , but as a Power from some outside origin , which brings into human affairs an inspiration and energy of its own . The " People " is not the population , // but a creation of mythology , to which inherent faculties and capacities are ascribed beyond what can be verified within experience . " Wall Street " takes the place which used to be assigned to the devil . What is that " Wall Street " which is currently spoken of by editors and public men as thinking , wanting , working for , certain things ? There is a collective interest which is so designated which is real , but the popular notion under " Wall Street " is unanalyzed . It is a phantasm or a myth . In all these cases there is a tyranny in the term . Who dare criticise democracy or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street ? The tyranny is greatest in regard to " American " and Americanism . " Who dare say that he is not " American " ? Who dare repudiate what is declared to be " Americanism " ? It follows that if anything is base and bogus it is always labeled " American . " If a thing is to be recommended which can not be justified , it is put under " Americanism . " Who does not shudder at the fear of being called " unpatriotic " ? and to repudiate what any one chooses to call " American " is to be unpatriotic . If there is any document of Americanism , it is the Declaration of Independence . Those who have Americanism especially in charge have repudiated the doctrine that " governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed , " because it stood in the way of what they wanted to do . They denounce those who cling to the doctrine as un-American . Then we see what Americanism and patriotism are . They are the duty laid upon us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clique of newspapers and politicians chooses to say or wants to do . " England " has always been , amongst us , a kind of counter token , or token of things to be resisted and repudiated . The " symbols , " or " tokens , " always have this utility for suggestion . They carrya coercion with them and overwhelm people who are not trained to verify assertions and dissect fallacies. 174 . Watchwords , catchwords . A watchword sums up one policy , doctrine , view , or phase of a subject . It may be legitimate and useful , but a watchword easily changes its meaning and takes up foreign connotations or fallacious suggestions // Critical analysis is required to detect and exclude the fallacy . Catchwords are acutely adapted to stimulate desires . In the presidential campaign of 1900 we saw a catchword deliberately invented , ? the full dinner pail . " Such an invention turns suggestion into an art . Socialism , as a subject of popular agitation , consists almost altogether of watchwords , catchwords , and phrases of suggestion : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , " " the disinherited , " " the submerged tenth , " " the mine to the miner , " " restore the land to the landless . " Trades unionism consists almost entirely , on its philosophical side , of suggestive watchwords and phrases . It is said that " labor " creates all value . This is not true , but the fallacy is complete when labor is taken in the sense of " laborers , " collectively and technically so called , ? an abuse of language which is now current . To say that wage-earners create all value is to assert a proposition from which numerous and weighty consequences follow as to rights and interests . The interest of one is the interest of all " is a principle which is as good for a band of robbers as for a union of any other kind . " Making work " by not producing is the greatest industrial fallacy possible . 175 . Slave , democracy . Since " democratic " is now a word to conjure with , we hear of democracy in industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word is destitute of meaning or is fallacious . It is used to prejudice the discussion . Since the abolition of slavery the word " slave " has become a token . In current discussions we hear of " rent slaves , " " wages slavery , " " debt slavery , " " marriage slavery , " etc . These words bear witness to great confusion and error in the popular notions of what freedom is and can be . For negroes emancipation contained a great disillusion . They had to learn what being " free " did not mean . Debt slavery is the oldest kind of slavery except war captivity . A man in debt is not free . A man who has made a contract is not free . A man who has contracted duties and obligations as husband and father , or has been born into them as citizen , son , brother , etc. , is not free . Can we imagine ourselves " free " from the conditions of human life ? Does it do // any good to stigmatize the case as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man is under a necessity to earn his living ? It would be a grand reform in the mores if the masses should learn to turn away in contempt from all this rhetoric . 176 . Epithets . Works of fiction have furnished the language with epithets for types of individuals ( sec. 622 ) . Don Quixote , Faust , Punch , Reinecke Fuchs , Br'er Rabbit , Falstaff , Bottom , and many from Dickens ( Pickwick , Pecksniff , Podsnap , Turveydrop , Uriah Heep ) are examples . The words are like coins . They condense ideas and produce classes . They economize language . They also produce summary criticisms and definition of types by societal selection . All the reading classes get the use of common epithets , and the usage passes to other classes in time . The coercion of an epithet of contempt or disapproval is something which it requires great moral courage to endure . 177 . Phrases . The educated classes are victims of the phrase . Phrases are rhetorical flourishes adapted to the pet notions of the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old tricks of the medicine man adapted to an age of literature and common schools . Instead of a rattle or a drum the operator talks about " destiny " and " duty , " or molds into easy phrases the sentiments which are popular . It is only a difference of method . Solemnity , unction , and rhetorical skill are needed . Often the phrases embody only visionary generalities . " Citizenship , " " publicity , " " public policy , " " restraint of trade , " " he who holds the sea will hold the land , " " trade follows the flag , " " the dollar of the fathers , " " the key of the Pacific , " " peace with honor , " are some of the recent coinages or recoinages . Phrases have great power when they are antithetical or alliterative . Some opponents of the silver proposition were quite perplexed by the saying : " The white man with the yellow metal is beaten by the yellow man with the white metal . " In 1844 the alliterative watchword " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it had been " Forty-nine thirty or fight , " that would not have had nearly so great effect . The Cape to Cairo " railroad is another case of alliteration . Humanitarianism has permeated our mores and has been a fountain of phrases 1 80 FOLKWAYS Forty years ago the phrase " enthusiasm of humanity " was invented . It inspired a school of sentimental philosophizing about social relations , which has been carried on by phrase making : " the dignity of labor , " " the nobility of humanity , " " a man is not a ware , " " an existence worthy of humanity , " " a living wage . " " Humanity " in modern languages is generally used in two senses : ( a ) the human race , ( b ) the sympathetic sentiment between man and man . This ambiguity enters into all the phrases which are humanitarian . 178 . Pathos . Suggestion is powerfully aided by pathos , in the original Greek sense of the word . Pathos is the glamour of sentiment which grows up around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protects it from criticism . The Greeks , in the fourth century before Christ , cherished pathos in regard to tyrannicide . Tyrants were bosses , produced by democracy in towns , but hated by democrats . Tyrannicides were surrounded with a halo of heroism and popular admiration ) . Something of the same sentiment was revived in the sixteenth century , when it appeared that a tyrant was any ruler whose politics one did not like . It cost several rulers their lives . Pathos was a large element in the notions of woman and knighthood ( twelfth and thirteenth centuries ) , of the church ( thirteenth century ) , of the Holy Sepulcher ( eleventh and twelfth centuries ) . In the thir-teenth century there was a large element of pathos in the glori ? fication of poverty . A great deal of pathos has been expended on the history and institutions of Greece and Rome in modern times . Classical studies still depend largely on it for their pres-tige . There is a pathos of democracy in the United States . In all English-speaking countries marriage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry and novels . Humanitarianism is nourished by pathos and it stimulates pathos . The " poor " and the " laborers " are objects of pathos , on account of which these terms , in literature , refer to a conventional and unreal concept . Consequently there is no honest discussion of any topic which concerns the poor or laborers . Some people make opposition to alcohol an object of pathos . // 179 . Pathos is unfavorable to truth . Whenever pathos is in play the subject is privileged . It is regarded with a kind of affection , and is protected from severe examination . It is made holy or sacred . The thing is cherished with such a preestablished preference and faith that it is thought wrong to verify it . Pathos , therefore , is unfavorable to truth . It has always been an element in religion . It is an element now in patriotism , and in regard to the history of one 's own country . The coercion of pathos on the individual comes in popular disapproval of truthtelling about the matter in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church until modern times , which to modern people seems so shocking and inexplicable , was chiefly due to pathos about religion and the church . If a forgery would help the church or religion , any one who opposed it would seem to be an enemy of religion and the church and willing to violate the pathos which surrounded them . 180 . The value of analysis and verification as tests . In all the cases of the use of catchwords , watchwords , and phrases , the stereotyped forms of language seem to convey thought , especially ascertained truth , and they do it in a way to preclude verification . It is absolutely essential to correct thinking and successful discussion to reject stereotyped forms , and to insist on analysis and verification . Evidently all forms of suggestion tend to create an atmosphere of delusion . Pathos increases the atmosphere of delusion . It introduces elements which corrupt the judgment . In effect , it continues the old notion that there are edifying falsehoods and useful deceits . The masses always infuse a large emotional element into all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in time , they surround what they accept with pathos which it is hard to break through . 181 . Humanity . The standard of humanity or of decent behavior , especially towards the weak or those persons who may be at one 's mercy , or animals , is entirely in the mores of the group and time . To the Gauchos of Uruguay " inhumanity and love of bloodshed become second nature . " Their customs of treating beasts habituate them to bloodshed . " They are callous to the sight of blood and suffering and come to positively // enjoy it . " They have no affection for their horses and dogs . They murder for plunder.l It is very rarely that we meet with such a description as that of any people . Polynesians were blood-thirsty and cruel , perhaps because they had no chase of wild animals in which to expend their energies.2 North American Indians could invent frightful tortures , but they were not blood-thirsty . They were not humane . Suffering did not revolt them . Schomburgk 3 tells a story of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with toothache . He cut down her hammock and caused her to fall so that she suffered a dislocation of the arm . A European witness went to the chief with a report and remonstrance , but the chief was astonished that any one should take any notice of such an incident . The Assyrians cut in stone representations of flaying , impaling , etc. , and of a king with his own royal hands putting out the eyes of prisoners . The Egyptians represented kings slaying men ( national enemies ) in masses . The Romans enjoyed bloodshed and the sight of suffer-ing.4 The Middle Ages reveled in cruelty to men and beasts . It is in the Middle Ages that we could find the nearest parallels to the Gauchos above . None of these people felt that repulsive revolt of the whole nature at inhumanity which characterizes modern cultivated people . The horrors have all receded out of our experience , and almost out of our knowledge . The line of familiarity is set far off . Therefore a little thing in the way of inhumanity is strange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which show us that human nature is not changed , and that the brute in it may awake again at any time . It is all a question of time , custom , and occasion , and the indi-vidual is coerced to adopt the mores as to these matters which are then and there current . 182 . Selection by distinction . One of the leading modes by which the group exercises selection of its adopted type on the individual is by distinction . Distinction is selection . It appeals to vanity . It acts in two ways and has two opposite effects . One likes to be separated from the crowd by what is admired , and dislikes to be distinguished for what is not admired . Cases // occur in which the noteworthy person is not sure whether he ought to be proud or ashamed of that for which he is distinguished . When a society gives titles , decorations , and rewards for acts , it stimulates what it rewards and causes new cases of it . The operation of selection is direct and rational . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most clearly its selective effect . School-teachers are familiar with the fact that children will imitate a peculiarity of one which marks him out from all the rest , even if it is a deformity or defect . Why then wonder that barbarian mothers try to deform their babies towards an adopted type of bodily perfection which is not rationally preferable ? A lady of my acquaintance showed me one of her dolls which had wire attachments on its legs in imitation of those worn by children for orthopedic effect . She explained that when she was a child , another child who had soft bones or weak ankles , and who wore irons for them , was brought into her group of playmates . They all admired and envied her , and all wished that they had weak bones so that they could wear irons . This lady made wire attachments for her doll that it might reach the highest standard . 183 . Aristocracies . All aristocracies are groups of those who are distinguished , at the time , for the possession of those things which are admired or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence or in social power . In the higher civilization , until modern times , the possession of land was the only social power which would raise a man above sordid cares and enable him to plan his life as he chose . By talent an income could be won which would give the same advantage , but not with the same security of permanence and independence . The fields for talent were war , civil administration , and religion , the last including all mental activity . Men of talent had to win their place by craft and charlatanism ( sorcery , astrology , therapeutics ) . Their position never was independent , except to church establishments . They had to win recognition from warriors and landowners , and they became comrades and allies of the latter . Merchants and bankers were the aristocracy at Carthage , Venice , Florence , and Genoa , and in the Hansa. // Talented military men were aristocrats under Napoleon , courtiers were such under Louis XIV , and ecclesiastics at Rome . Since the fourteenth century capital has become a new and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time , have the then most important social power in their hands are courted and flattered , envied and served , by the rest . They make an aristocracy . The aristocrats are the distinguished ones , and their existence and recognition give direction to social ambition . Of course this acts selectively to call out what is most advan-tageous and most valued in the society . There are a number of mass phenomena which are on a lower grade than the mores , lacking the elements of truth and right with respect to welfare , which illustrate still further and more obviously the coercion of all mass movements over the individual . These are fashion , poses , fads , and affectations . Fashion . Fashion in dress has covered both absurdities and indecencies with the aegis of custom . From the beginning of the fourteenth century laws appear against indecent dress . What nobles invented , generally in order to give especial zest to the costume of a special occasion , that burghers and later peasants imitated and made common.l In the fifteenth cen-tury the man 's hose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a different color , and was decorated and stuffed as if to exaggerate still further the indecent obtrusiveness of it.2 Schultz 3 says that the pictures which we have do not show the full indecency of the dress against which the clergy and moral-ists of the fifteenth century uttered denunciations , but only those forms which were considered decent , that is , those which were within the limits which custom at the time had established At the same time women began to uncover the neck and bosom . The extent to which this may be carried is always controlled by fashion and the mores . Puritans and Quakers attempted to restrict it entirely , and to so construct the dress , by a necker-chief or attachment to the bodice , that the shape of the bust should be entirely concealed . The mores rejected this rule as // excessive . In spite of all the eloquence of the moral preachers , that form of dress which shows neck and bosom has become established , only that it is specialized for full dress and covered by conventionalization. 186 . Conventionalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ballet or burlesque opera and the bathing dress . Conventionalization always includes strict specification and limits of time , place , and occasion , beyond which the same dress would become vicious . Amongst Moslems and Orientals this conventionalization as to dress has never been introduced . We are familiar with the fact that when a fashion has been introduced and has become common our eye is formed to it , and no one looks " right " or stylish who does not conform to it . We also know that after the fashion has changed things in the discarded fashion look dowdy and rustic . No one can resist these impressions , try as he may . This fact , in the experience of everybody , gives us an example of the power of current custom over the individual . While a fashion reigns its tendency is to greater and greater extravagance in order to produce the desired and admired effect . Then the toleration for any questionable element in the fashion is extended and the extension is unnoticed . If a woman of 186o , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1906 , in the dress of her time , each would be amazed at the indecency of the dress of the other . No dress ever was more , or more justly , denounced for ugliness , inconvenience , and indecency than the crinoline , but all the women from 1855 to 1865 , including some of the sweetest who ever lived , wore it . No inference whatever as to their taste or character would be justified . There never is any rational judgment in the fashion of dress . No criticism can reach it . In a few cases we know what actress or princess started a certain fashion , but in the great majority of cases we do not know whence it came or who was responsible for it . We all have to obey it . We hardly ever have any chance to answer hack . Its all-sufficient sanction is that " everybody wears it , " or wears it so . Evidently this is only a special application to dress of a general usage ? conventionalization. 1 86 FOLKWAYS 187 . Uncivilized fashions . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dress must be sought in the time anterior to waistband and apron . All the barbarians and savages were guilty of folly , frivolity , and self-deformation in the service of fashion . They found an ideal somewhere which they wanted to attain , or they wanted to be distinguished , that is , raised out of the commonplace and universal . At one stage distinction comes from being in the fashion in a high and marked degree . Also each one flees the distinction of being out of the fashion , which would not draw admiration . At another stage distinction comes from starting a new fashion . This may be done by an ornament , if it is well selected so that it will " take . " 1 Beads have been a fashionable ornament from the days of savagery until to-day . An Indian woman in Florida " had six quarts ( probably a peck ) of the beads gathered about her neck , hanging down her back , down upon her breasts , filling the space under her chin , and covering her neck up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move her head . She , however , was only a little , if any , better off in her possessions than most of the others . Others were about equally burdened . Even girl babies are favored by their proud mammas with a varying quantity of the coveted neckwear . The cumbersome beads are said to be worn by night as well as by day . " 2 " A woman sometimes hangs a weight of over five pounds around her neck , for besides the ordinary necklaces the northern women wear one or more large white , polished shells , which are brought from the western coast and which weigh from half a pound upward . " 3 Fashions change in Bechuanaland ; one year the women all wear blue beads , but perhaps the next ( and just when a trader has laid in a supply of blue beads ) they refuse to wear any color but yellow . At the time of writing 1886 the men wore small black pot hats , but several years ago they had used huge felt hats , like that of Rip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of those unsalable ones . " 4 // 188 . Fashion in ethnography . The Carib women in Surinam think that large calves of the leg are a beauty . Therefore they hind the leg above the ankle to make the calves larger . They begin the treatment on children ) Some Australian mothers press down their babies ' noses . " They laugh at the sharp noses of Europeans , and call them tomahawk noses , preferring their own style . " 2 The presenoe of two races side by side calls attention to the characteristic differences . Race vanity then produces an effort to emphasize the race characteristics . Samoan mothers want the noses and foreheads of their babies to be flat , and they squeeze them with their hands accordingly.3 The " Papuan ideal of female beauty has a big nose , big breasts , and a dark-brown , smooth skin .

Tylor2 says that an African belle wears big copper rings which become hot in the sun , so that the lady has to have an attendant , whose duty it is to cool them down by wetting them . The queen of the Wavunias on the Congo wore a brass collar around her neck , which weighed from sixteen to twenty pounds . She had to Aie down once in a while to rest.9 The I lerero wear iron which in the dry climate retains luster .

The men also wear leather bracelets and necklaces. ? In Behar , Hindostan , the women wear brass rings on their legs . " One of these is heavy , nearly a foot broad , and serrated all around the edges . It can only be put on the legs by a blacksmith , who fits it on the legs of the women with his hammer , while they writhe upon the ground in pain .

" 2 The cases given show that ideals of beauty are somehow formed , which call for a deformation of the human body . The foreheads are flattened , the lips enlarged , the ears drawn down , the skull forced into a sugar-loaf shape , the nose flattened , etc. , to try to reach a form approved by fashion . There is an ideal of beauty behind the fashion , a selected type of superiority , which must be assumed as the purpose of the fashion . 190 . Fashion in other things than dress . As will appear below , fashion controls many things besides dress . It governs the forms of utensils , weapons , canoes and boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteenth and sixteenth centuries there was a fashionable attitude or pose in standing for women , in which the abdomen was thrown forward . It is often seen in pictures and portraits.3 It is inelegant and destitute of mean-ing . The Venetians were luxurious and frivolous , jealous and distrustful of women , and fond of pleasure and fashion . From the end of the sixteenth century a shopkeeper in the Merceria adopted a custom of showing the new fashions of Paris on Ascension Day by means of a life-size doll dressed in them.4 The Venetian women of that period wore patins , shoes with blocks underneath , some of which were two feet high . The women were unable to walk without a maid on each side to support them.5 Yriarte thinks that these patins were due to the policy of the husbands . When an ambassador , in conversation with the doge and his counselors , said that shoes would be far more convenient , a counselor replied , " Only too convenient ! // Only too much so ! " Under the French Directory , a demi-terme was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they would soon be mothers.l Thirty years ago " poufs " were worn to enlarge the dress on the hips at the side . The " Grecian bend , " stooping forward , was an attitude both in walking and standing . Then followed the bustle . Later , the contour was closely fitted by the dress . No one thought that the human figure would be improved if changed as the dress made it appear to be . No fashion was adopted because it would have an indecent effect . The point for our purpose is that women wore dresses of the appointed shape because everybody did so , and for no other reason , being unconscious of the effect . Erasmus , in his colloquy on the Franciscans , makes one of the characters say : " I think that the whole matter of dress depends upon custom and the opinions which are current . " He refers to some unnamed place where adulterers , after conviction , are never allowed to uncover the private parts , and says , " Cus-tom has made it , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact is that nothing is so ridiculous that usage may not make it pass . " Fashion has controlled the mode of dressing the hair and deforming the body . It has determined what animals , or what special race of an animal species , should be petted . It controls music and literature , so that a composer , poet , or novelist is the rage or is forgotten . In medæval literature the modes of alle-gory were highly esteemed and very commonly used . The writers described war and battles over and over again , and paid little attention to nature . In fact , natural background , geography , and meteorology were made as conventional as stage scenery , and were treated as of no interest and little importance . Modern taste for reality and for the natural details throws this mediaval characteristic by contrast into strong relief . 191 . Miscellaneous fashions . Fashion rules in architecture . In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in England , English Renaissance and Gothic were regarded as barbaric , and palladian was admired . In France the preference was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the English Renaissance and Gothic are in favor again , and palladian is regarded with disfavor . Painting and sculpture undergo variations of fashion as to standards and methods . The same is true of literature . Poetry and novels follow phases of fashion . A successful novel makes imitations and sets a fashion for a time . Types of heroes and ideals of character come and go by fashion . The type of the man-as-he-should-be varies by fashion , and this type exerts a great selection in the education of the young . Educa-tional methods run through fashions . Fads in methods of teach-ing arise , are advocated with great emphasis , have their run , decline , and disappear . There are fashions of standing , walking , sitting , gesture , language ( slang , expletives ) , pronunciation , key of the voice , inflection , and sentence accent ; fashions in shaking hands , dancing , eating and drinking , showing respect ; visiting , foods , hours of meals , and deportment . When snuff was taken attitudes and gestures in taking it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of female beauty is at a time preferred , ? plump or svelte , blond or brunette , large or petite , red-haired or black-haired . When was that " simple time of our fathers " when people were too sensible to care for fashions ? It certainly was before the Pharaohs and perhaps before the glacial epoch . Isaiah ( iii . 16 ) rebukes the follies of fashion . Chrysostom preached to the early church against tricks and manners of gesture and walk which had been learned in the theater . Since literature has existed moral-ists have satirized fashion . Galton has noticed what any one may verify , ? that old portraits show " indisputable signs of one predominant type of face supplanting another . " " If we may believe caricaturists , the fleshiness and obesity of many English men and women in the earlier years of this century nineteenth must have been prodigious . " 1 Part of this phenomenon may be due to the fashion of painting . The portrait painter warps all his subjects toward the current standard of good looks , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of variation . Platycnem-ism and the pierced olecranon run in groups for a time . Then // they run out . There are fashions in disease , as if fashion were really in nature . This goes beyond the limits of our definition , but the rise and passing away of variations in breeding plants and animals , and perhaps in men , suggests that fashion may be an analogous play of experiment , half caprice , half earnest , whose utility lies in selection . If there was no reaching out after novelty except upon rational determination , the case would be very different from what it is when variation brings spontaneous suggestions . Our present modes of dress ( aside from the variations imposed by fashion ) are the resultant of all the fashions of the last two thousand years . 192 . All deformations by fashion are irrational . There is no guarantee that fashions will serve expediency . Deformations of the skull may not be harmful ; they are not useful . The block inserted in the lip interferes with eating and speaking . It alters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it . To those who are outside the fashion it is extremely ugly and disgusting . To those inside the fashion it is a standard of beauty and a badge of dignity and tribal position . All fashions tend to extravagance because the senses become accustomed to them , and it is necessary , in order to renew the impression of distinction , to exaggerate . The extravagances of fashion run through all grades of civilization . They show that fashion , coming from the whole to the individual , adds nothing to the sense , judgment , or taste of the latter , but imposes on him a coercion to conform . He who dissents is thought rustic and boorish . He is more or less severely boycotted , which means not only that he is made to suffer , but that he loses important advantages and hurts his interests . 193 . Satires on fashion . Forty years ago a lady who swung her arms as she walked was considered strong-minded . A lady who was young when the present queen of England introduced the fashion of brushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed indecent . Fashion is stronger than autocracy . Nicholas I of Russia disapproved of late hours and ordered that court balls should be commenced early that they might be finished early . He found himself almost alone until eleven // o'clock , and had to give up his reform.l In the height of the crinoline fashion Leech published in Punch a picture of two maiden ladies who " think crinoline a preposterous and extravagant invention and appear at a party in a simple and elegant attire . " The shocked horror of the bystanders is perfect , but the two ladies would to-day be quite in the fashion . Du Maurier published in Punch a skit in which a little girl asked her mother how Eve knew , the first time that she saw Cain as a baby , that he was not ugly . This is a very clever hit at the origin of conventions . There was when Cain was born no established convention that all babies are pretty . 194 . Fashion in faiths and ideals . There are also fashions in trading , banking , political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows , amusements , flowers , fancywork , carriages , gardens , and games . There seem to be fashions in logic and reasoning . Arguments which are accepted as convincing at one time have no effect at another ( sec. 227 , n. 4 ) . For centuries western Europe accepted the argument for the necessity of torture in the administration of justice as convincing . At different periods the satisfaction in allegory as a valid method of interpretation has been manifested and the taste for allegory in the arts has appeared . Philosophy goes through a cycle of forms by fashion . Even mathematics and science do the same , both as to method and as to concepts . That is why " methodology " is eternal . Mediaeval " realism " ruled all thought for centuries , and its dominion is yet by no means broken . It prevails in political philosophy now . Nominalism is the philosophy of modern thought . Scholasticism held all the mental outfit of the learned . Thomas Aquinas summed up all that man knows or needs to know . A modern man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page of it , even for historical purposes . " Phlogiston " and " vortices " had their day and are forgotten . Eighteenth-century deism and nineteenth-century rationalism interest nobody any more . Eighteenth-century economists argued in favor of stimulating population in order to make wages low , and thereby win in international competition . They never had a // compunction or a doubt about this argument . No wonder it has been asserted that all truth , except that which is mathematically demonstrable , is only a function of the age . When the earth is underpopulated and there is an economic demand for men , democracy is inevitable . That state of things can not be permanent . Therefore democracy can not last . It contains no absolute and " eternal " truth . While it lasts a certain set of political notions and devices are in fashion . Certain moral standards go with them . Evolution is now accepted as a final fact in regard to organic phenomena . A philosophy of nature is derived from it . Is it only a fashion , ? a phase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a philosophy has no guarantee except that it is current . All accept it because all accept it , and for no other reason . Narrower philosophies become the fashion in classes , coteries , and cliques . They are really affectations of something which wins prestige and comes to be a badge of culture or other superiority . A few are distinguished because they know Greek , or because they are " freethinkers , " or because they are ritualists , or because they profess a certain cultus in art , or because they are disciples of Ruskin , Eastlake , Carlyle , Emerson , Browning , Tolstoi , or Nietsche , and cultivate the ideas and practices which these men have advocated as true and wise . Often such fashions of thought or art pass from a narrow coterie to a wider class , and sometimes they permeate the mores and influence an age . When men believed in witches they did so because everybody did . When the belief in witches was given up it was because a few men set the fashion , and it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fashion not trivial ; not subject to argument . Fashion is by no means trivial . It is a form of the dominance of the group over the individual , and it is quite as often harmful as beneficial . There is no arguing with the fashion . In the case of dress we can sometimes tell what princess or actress started the fashion , and we sometimes know , in the case of ideas , who set them afloat . Generally , however , it is not known who started a fashion in dress . The authority of fashion is imperative as to everything which it touches . The sanctions are ridicule and // powerlessness . The dissenter hurts himself ; he never affects the fashion . No woman , whatever her age or position or her Opinion about the crinoline fashion , could avoid wearing one . No effort to introduce a fashion of " rational dress " for women has ever yet succeeded . An artist , novelist , poet , or playwright of a school which is out of fashion fails and is lost . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing . The fashion , therefore , operates a selection in which success and merit are often divorced from each other , but the selection is pitiless . The canons of criticism are set by fashion . It follows that there is no rational effect of fashion . There was a rule in goblinism : Say naught but good of the dead . The rule was dictated by fear that the ghost would be angry and return to avenge the dead . The rule has come down to us and is an imperative one . Eulogies on the dead are , therefore , conventional falsehoods . It is quite impossible for any one to depart from the fashion . The principle is in fashion that one should take the side of the weaker party in a contest . This principle has no rational ground at all . There is simply a slight probability that the stronger will be in the wrong . Fashion requires that we should all affect nonpartisanship in discussion , although it is absurd to do so . Of course these weighty rules on important matters go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are arbitrary , have no rational grounds , can not be put to any test , and have no sanction except that everybody submits to them . 196 . Remoter effects of fashion . The selective effect of fashion , in spite of its irrationality and independently of the goodness or badness of its effect on interests , is a reflection on the intelligence of men . It accounts for many heterogeneous phenomena in society . The fashions influence the mores . They can make a thing modest or immodest , proper or improper , and , if they last long enough , they affect the sense and the standards of modesty and propriety . Fashions of banking and trading affect standards of honesty , or definitions of cheating and gambling . Public shows , dances , punishments , and executions affect , in time , standards of decency , taste in amusement , sentiments of humanity , views as to what is interesting and attractive . // Methods of argument which are fashionable may train people to flippancy , sophistry , levity of mind , and may destroy the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as a means to transfer to Germany the depravation of morals which had corrupted the Latin nations in the sixteenth century . Fashions now spread through all civilized nations by contact and contagion . They are spread by literature . 197 . Slang and expletives . Slang and expletives are fashions in language . Expletives are of all grades from simple interjec-tions to the strongest profanity . Many expletives are ancient religious formulas of objurgation , obsecration , asseveration , anathema , etc . They express a desire to curse or bless , invite or repel . Where the original sense is lost they sink into inter-jections , the whole sense of which is in the accent . Their use rises and falls with fashion in nations , classes , groups , and fam-ilies , and it controls the habits of individuals . Whether certain persons use a pious dialect , a learned ( pedantic ) dialect , a gam-bler 's slang , a phraseology of excessive adjectives and silly expletives , or profane expressions , oaths , and phrases which abuse sacred things , depends on birth and training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each group and corre sponds to the mores of the group . There may be some psychol. ogy of expletives , 2 but they seem to be accounted for , like slang , by the expediency of expression , which is the purpose of all language . There is a need for expression which will win attention and impress the memory . A strong expletive shocks an opponent , or it is an instinctive reaction on a situation which threatens the well-being of the speaker . It is a vent to emotion which gives relief from it when other relief is not possible . This last is one of the chief useful reasons for expletives . How-ever , even then they are a vicious habit , for stronger and stronger expressions are required to win the same subjective effects . Old expressions lose force . Slang is the new coinage . The mintage is often graphic and droll ; it is also often stupid and vulgar . A selection goes on . Some of it is rejected and // some enters into the language . Expletives also go out of fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly greater and greater excess . It becomes a bad personal habit to use grotesque and extravagant expressions . Slang and expletives destroy the power of clear and cogent expression in speech or writing ; and they must affect powers of thinking . Although slang is a new coinage which reinvigorates the language , the fashion of slang and expletives must be rated , like the fashion of using tobacco and alcohol , as at best a form of play , a habit and custom which springs from no need and conduces to no interest . The acts result in an idle satisfaction of the doer , and the good or ill effects all fall within his own organism . The prevalence of such fashions in a society becomes a fact of its mores , for there will be rational effects on interests . The selective effect of them is in the resistance to the fashions or subjection to them . They are only to a limited extent enforced by social sanctions . There is personal liberty in regard to them . Resistance depends on independent judgment and self-control , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . Groups are differentiated inside the society of those who resist and those who do not , and the effect on the mores ( character of the group ) results . The selective effects appear in the competition of life between the two groups . 198 . Poses , fads , and cant . When fashion seizes upon an idea or usage and elevates it to a feature of a society at a period , it is , as was said above , affected by those who can not attain to the real type and who exaggerate its external forms . The humanism of the Renaissance produced an affectation of learning , dilettante interest in collecting manuscripts , and zeal for style which was genuine in scholars , but was an affectation of the followers . There was also an affectation of pagan philosophy and of alienation from Christianity . The euphuists in England in the sixteenth century , the precieuses of Moliere 's time , the illuminati of the eighteenth century , are instances of groups of people who took up a whim and exaggerated conduct of a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are practiced as a fashion for a time . Fads get currency . // Dandyism , athleticism , pedantry of various kids , reforms of various kinds , movements , causes , and questions are phenomena of fads around which groups cluster , formed of persons who have a common taste and sentiment . Poses go with them . Poses are also affected by those who select a type of character which is approved . The dandy has had a score of slang names within two centuries corresponding to varieties of the pose and dress which he affected . He has now given way to the athlete , who is quite a different type . The Byronic pose prevailed for a generation . Goethe 's Werther inspired a pose . They would both now be ridiculed . Favorite heroes in novels have often set a pose . Carlyle inspired a literary pose ( " hatred of shams , " etc . ) . He and Ruskin set a certain cant afloat , for every fad and pose which pretends to be sober and earnest must have a cant . Zola , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sudermann , are men who have operated suggestion on the public mind of our time . They get a response from a certain number who thus cluster into a self-selected union of sympathy and propagate the cult of a view of life . Gloom and savagery , passion and crime , luxury and lust , romance and adventure , adultery and divorce , self-indulgence and cynicism , the reality of foulness and decay , are so suggested as to become centers on which receptive minds will organize and congenial ones will combine in sympathy . It is the effect of a great and active literature of belles-lettres , which is practically current throughout the civilized world , to multiply these sects of sentimental philosophy , with the fads and poses which correspond , and to provide them with appropriate cant . The cant of the voluptuary , the cynical egoist , the friend of humanity , and all the rest is just as distinct as that of the religious sectarian . Each of the little groups operates its own selection , but each is small . They interfere with and neutralize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them to the mores . Our age is optimistic by virtue of the economic opportunities , power , and prosperity which it enjoys . The writers above mentioned are all pessimistic . They do not affect the age except upon the surface , by entertaining it , but they disturb its moral philosophy , // they confuse its standards and codes , and they corrupt its tastes . They set fashions in literature which the writers of the second class imitate . In general , they relax the inhibitions which have come down to us in our mores without giving by suggestion an independence of character which would replace the traditions by sound judgments . Their influence will be greater when it has ? been diluted so as to reach the great mass . It hardly can be worse than that of the literature which is now used by that class . 199 . Illustrations . In the later days of Greece the study of Homer became an affectation . Dio Chrysostom tells of a visit he made to a colony on the Borysthenes , in which nearly all could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else ) . The Athenians , especially the gilded youth , affected Spar-tan manners and ways . The dandies went about with uncut hair , unwashed hands , and they practiced fist-fights . They were as proud of torn ears as German students are of cuts on their faces.2 The religious and social reforms of Augustus were a pose . They lacked sincerity and were adopted for a political purpose . Men took them up who did not conform their own conduct to them . Hence a " general social false-hood " was the result.3 In the fourth and fifth centuries all the well-to-do classes spent their time in making imitations of the ancient literature and philosophy . They tried to imitate Seneca and Pliny , writing compositions and letters , and pursuing a mode of life which they supposed the men of the period of glory had lived. ? The French of the fifteenth century had the great-est fear of ridicule ; the Italians feared most that they might appear to be simpletons.5 In the fifteenth and sixteenth cen-turies the " chevaliers transis " wore furs in summer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " love suffices for everything . " 6 Old pictures of the sixteenth century show that it was considered modest to squint . A Spaniard thought // that it showed friendship for any one to squint at him . It was also considered a sign of probity to have the lips primly closed and drawn.l The Italian cicisbeo in the seventeenth century was a cavalier servente , who attended a married lady . Such men practiced extravagances and affectations , and are generally described as effeminate.2 Heroes , scapegoats and butts , caricature . Fashion sets. , 4 for any group at my time , its pet likes and dislikes . The mass must have its heroes , but also its victims and scapegoats and the butts of its ri Caricature is futile when it is destitute of point . The st of it lies in the popular response which shows whether it has touched the core of the thing or not . When it can do this it reveals the real truth about the thing better than a volume of argument could do it . Sometimes a popular conviction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societal fact . The voyage of the Oregon from the Pacific ( 1898 ) convinced the American people that they must cut a canal through the isthmus . Probably this conviction was a non sequitur , but argument can not overcome it , and it will control action with all the financial and other consequences which must ensue . A satire , an epigram , or a caricature may suffice to produce such a conviction . Caricature . The mere rhetorical form may have the greatest importance . A caricature often stings national vanity . A state may be represented as afraid , as having " backed down , ' as having appeared ridiculous . Group vanity is often a stronger motive than personal vanity , and the desire to gratify it will prove stronger than any rational conviction . Relation of fads , etc. , to mores . Thus the vanities , desires , prejudices , faiths , likes , and dislikes , which pervade a society , coerce dissenters and become stronger and stronger mass phenomena . They then affect interests . Then they wind strands of influence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they weave webs of action which constitute life and history . The selection which they SOCIETAL SELECTION 2OI exert , drawing in some and repelling others , produces results on the societal fabric of a later time . The consequences react on character , moral tone , life philosophy , ethical principles , and ruling sentiments . Thus they affect the mores , or even enter into them . The whole is handed on to the rising generation to be their outfit of knowledge , faith , and policy , and their rules of duty and well living . 203 . Ideals . An ideal is entirely unscientific . It is a phantasm which has little or no connection with fact . Ideals are very often formed in the effort to escape from the hard task of dealing with facts , which is the function of science and art . There is no process by which to reach an ideal . There are no tests by which to verify it . It is therefore impossible to frame a proposition about an ideal which can beproved or disproved . I t follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to proper cases , and that the attempt to use ideals in social discussion does not deserve serious consideration . An ideal differs from a model in that the model is deduced from reality but within the bounds of reality . It is subject to approved methods of attainment and realization . An ideal also differs from a standard , for a standard must be real . 204 . When ideals may be used . What are the proper cases for the use of ideals ? Ideals can be useful when they are formed in the imagination of the person who is to realize them by his own exertions , for then the ideal and the programme of action are in the same consciousness , and therefore the defects of an ideal are reduced or removed . Ideals are useful ( a ) in homiletics , which are chiefly occupied with attempts at suggestion . In limited cases a preacher or teacher can suggest ideals which , if apprehended and adopted , become types toward which young persons may train themselves . Even then these cases merge in the next class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea is then taken up from books or from admired persons by suggestion and imitation , or from autosuggestion , but generally from a combination of the two . An ideal from autosugcstion produces enthusiasm . The fantastic character of the ea , if the person is young , is unimportant . His will is enlisted // to work for it . He can constantly compare the ideal with his experience . The ideal is at last shorn down to reality and merges in sober plans of effort . ( c ) A far larger field for ideals is afforded by vanity . As vanity is itself a subjective affection , but one which can be awakened only in society , it uses the imagination to suppose cases , plan unlimited schemes , devise types of self-decoration and dreams of superiority , distinction , power , success , and glory . The creations are all phantasms . The ends are all ideals . These ideals may not be extravagant . Vanity generally creates them by raising to a higher pitch some treatment of the body or dress , some admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or given pleasure and won applause . This whole field for ideals is largely influenced by suggestion from the current tastes and fashionable standards in the group , but autosuggestion is also very active in it . ( d ) Ideals also find a great field in marriage . In this case ideals of happiness have powerfully affected the institution at all its stages . Experience of marriage has been partly pleasant and partly the contrary . The experience has stimulated the reflection : How blessed it would be if only this or that unpleasant detail could be corrected ! This has led to idealization or the imaginative conception of a modified institution . Our novels now sometimes aid in this idealization . Men loved their daughters with zealous and protective affection long before they loved their wives . The father 's love reached out to follow his daughter into matrimony and to secure for her some stipulations which should free wedlock for her from pain or care which other wives had to endure . These stipulations were always guided by idealization . The rich and great were first able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , custom , and the mores , and the institution was perfected and refined by them . 205 . Ideals of beauty . The educated ideals under the second and third of the above heads become mass phenomena under the influence of fashion , when they control many or all . Ideal types of beauty are adopted by a group . Uncivilized people adopt such types of bodily beauty ( sec. 189 ) . The origin of them is unknown . A Samoan mother presses her thumb on the // nose of her baby to flatten it. l An Indian mother puts a board on the forehead of her baby to make it recede . Teeth are knocked out , or filed into prescribed shapes , or blackened . The skin is painted , cut into scars , or tattooed . Goblinism may have furnished the original motives for some deformations , but the natural physical features of the group which distinguish it from others , or the features produced by goblinistic usages , come to be the standard of beauty for the group . Those features are accentuated and exaggerated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal perfection of physical beauty . All fashion in dress has the same philosophy . In other cases , also , it seems that fashion is pursuing a fleeting and impossible ideal of perfect beauty , style , grace , dexterity , etc. , which shall give distinction and superiority or impose subjection . 206 . The man-as-he-should-be . Group ideals may be types of character . In the Old Testament the ideal type is the " just man , " who conformed to ritual standards at all points . A Mos-lem is a man who is faithful " to Islam , which is self-surrender to the Omnipotent One.2 The type of the perfect man-as-he-should-be in the Mahabharata is one who will give his all to a Brahmin . The god Siva , disguised as a Brahmin , came to a hero . He ordered the hero to kill his own son and serve his corpse for the Brahmin to eat . The hero obeyed at once . The Brahmin set the hero 's buildings on fire , but the latter served the dish without heeding the fire . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to obey , but was excused from this trial . He had triumphantly stood the test . There was nothing he would not do for a Brahmin.3 The poem also contains a type of female perfection in person and character , ? Savitri.4 The Greeks had many standards of personal excellence and social worth which entered to some extent into their mores . The ideal types were noble and refined . They have affected the mores of the class educated in the humanities " since the Renaissance . // They have never been truly incorporated in the mores of any society . Olbos was wealth , with grace , opulence , elegance , and generosity , and so wealth when not sordid or arrogant , the opposite of plutocratic . Arete was capacity , capability , and prac-tical efficiency , ? executive ability . Aidos was the opposite of " cheek . " Sophrosyne was continence , self-control . Kalokaga-lhie contained notions of economic , aesthetic , and moral good , fused into a single concept ) . The eleutheros was the gentleman endowed with all admirable qualities.2 The Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobly . The ideals were in the literature , not in the mores . " Their predisposition , their will , and their fate formed a consistent whole , and their decline was a consequence of the social and political life which they lived . " 3 In the sixth and seventh centuries A.D. the man-as-he-should-be was religious , ? a hermit or a monk . In any case he was an ascetic . In Charlemagne 's time the preferred type was changed . It became the warrior and knight , and led up to chivalry . A new poetry flourished to develop and propagate the new ideal . In mediaval society there were strongly defined ideals of the man-as-he-should-be . Mille was generosity of heart and mind . In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it was the noble desire of the lord to share all he had with his retainers , which desire called out their devotion to him.4 The minstrels meant by it lavishness of gifts to themselves . Maze was the cardinal virtue . It meant observation of the limits in all actions and manifestations of feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration of arbitrary ideals of ecclesiastical virtues . The ideals were ascetic . They seem to have been derived from the fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries , but they offer an example of borrowed and adopted ideals which were fully incorporated in the popular mores . The age accepted ascetic standards of goodness and character . The religious classes and the lay classes did not fall under the same // standards of conduct and duty . It was the business of the former to live by the full standard . All classes , however , accepted the standards as valid , and the layman conformed to them at times , or as far as worldly life would permit . Elizabeth of Thuringia seems to be the ideal of the married woman , but her saintliness interfered with her other duties , and even her own time does not seem to have been sure in its judgment of her . That she was flogged is a fact which has many relations to her character and her age ) . All admired men who practiced asceti-cism and self-discipline . The types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both highly elaborated . The knightly type began to develop in the time of Charlemagne and ran through the crusades . It contained grotesque and absurd elements . The story of the crusades is a criticism upon it . The knight was a fantastic person , who might do isolated deeds of valor , but who could not make a plan , work persistently to a purpose , cooperate with others , or either enforce or submit to discipline . Both the knight and the saint were ideal types which exerted a controlling power of selection through centuries . 207 . The standard type of man . Is the ideal of the man-as-he-should-be to be found , for us , in the " common man , " or in the highest product of our culture ? That is a most vital question for any society . It includes the question whether the society has a discord in itself as to its own ideal of the type of men it wants to produce . In the upper strata of the masses , amongst the educated , industrious , sober-minded people of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children live constantly with their parents , and the latter watch over the health , manners , and morals of the children unceasingly from birth to maturity . The same parents make great sacrifices for the education of their children , although the class , as a class , has means to secure what is necessary without hard sacrifice . The point is that they value education highly and get it . We also multiply educational institutions . We feel sure that all this is good work . The churches and all good literature constantly inculcate good manners and morals according to the standards in the present // mores . Here is a set of objects to be prized and worked for in families , schools , self-education , literature , and art , which go to the production of a type of men as the highest product of our civilization . Then suddenly we are told that the common man is wise beyond all the philosophers . The man on the curbstone is the arbiter of our destinies , and the standard man . Culture " is derided and sneered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings up a serious question : whether we are spoiling our children by educating them . Are we spoiling them for political power ? Are we putting them under disabilities for public influence ? It is related of an English statesman , that when asked by an American mother whether she should send her son to Oxford , he replied : " Why send him to Oxford ? Send him to Washington , where he will learn democracy . That is what he will need to know . " Certainly it behooves us to know whether we are spoiling our sons by sending them to the uni ? versities , and whether we ought not rather to send them to Tammany Hall . Either on one side or the other there is a great mass of empty phrases and false but inflated rhetoric . 208 . Who does the thinking ? The notion that " the group thinks " deserves to be put by the side of the great freaks of philosophy which have been put forth from age to age . Only the elite of any society , in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on by them by the transplanting of ideas from mind to mind , under the stress and strain of clashing argument and tugging debate . If the group thinks , then thought costs nothing , but in truth thought costs beyond everything else , for thousands search and talk while only one finds ; when he finds something , a step is won and all begins over again . If this is so , it ought to be universally known and recognized . All the mores would then conform to it . 209 . The gentleman . In modern English-speaking society the " gentleman " is the name for the man-as-he-should-be . The type is not fixed and the definition is not established . It is a collective and social ideal . Gentlemen are a group in society who have selected a code and standard of conduct as most conducive to prosperous and pleasant social relations . Therefore // manners are an essential element in the type . A gentleman is one who has been educated to conform to the type , and that he has the cachet is indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmit the ideal ; clubs are the tribunal of it . It is a floating notion which varies with the mores . The modern reader finds very few cases in Greek literature of what he can recognize as gentlemen . Orestes in the Electra of Euripides opens the discussion of what makes the worth of a man , but after saying that it is not wealth or poverty , and not valor in war , he flinches the question and says that it is better to leave it untouched . The peasant , married to Electra , certainly acts the gentleman . He also says of Orestes and Pylades , that if they really are as noble as they seem , they will be as well satisfied with humble fare as with grand fare . A gentleman of a century ago would not be approved now . A gentleman of to-day in the society of a century ago would be thought to have rowdy manners . Artificial manners are not in the taste of our time ; athletics are . The " gentleman " always tends to an arbitrary definition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports and games . The selective force of the social type of the gentleman is obvious in our own society . The sentiment noblesse oblige was once the name for the coercive force exerted on a noble by the code of his class . Now that fixed classes are gone and the gentleman is only defined by the usage and taste of an informal class , it is a term for the duties which go with social superiority of any kind , so far as those duties are prescribed and sanctioned by public opinion . 210 . Social standard set by taboos . It may be still more important to notice that the standard social type is defined by taboos with only social sanctions . The negative side of noblesse oblige is more important than the positive . A gentleman is under more restraints than a non-gentleman . In the eighteenth century he patronized cockfights and prize fights , and he could get drunk , gamble , tell falsehoods , and deceive women without losing caste . He now finds that noblesse oblige forbids all these things , and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A society exerts a positive selection on individuals by its defini-tion of crimes and by its criminal jurisprudence . The taboos are turned into laws and are enforced by positive penalties . 211 . Crimes . The number and variety of crimes depends on the positive action of the state . What things are crimes in a state , therefore , indicates what the ruling authority desires to prevent . The motives have often been entirely selfish on the part of a king or a ruling caste , or they were dictated by a desire to further the vanity of such persons . By judicial precedent at Rome it was made a crime to beat a slave , or to undress near a statue of the emperor , or to carry a coin bearing his image into a latrine or a lupanar.l Xiphilin , in his epitome of the history of Dio Cassius , inserts a story that , in the reign of Domitian , a woman was executed for undressing near the statue of that emperor ? The notions in the mores of what ought to be prevented have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in office drove his own chariot , although by night . ? Seneca was shocked at the criminal luxury of putting snow in wine.4 Pliny is equally shocked at the fashion of wearing gold rings. ? Lecky , after citing these cases , refers to the denunciations uttered by the church fathers against women who wore false hair . Painting the face is an old fault of women , against which moral teachers of all ages have thundered . Very recently , amongst us , clergymen have denounced women for not wearing bonnets in church , because Paul said that she " dishon-oreth her head , for that is even all one as if she were shaven . " 6 These were not indeed cases of crimes , but of alleged vices or sins . In sumptuary laws we have cases of legislation which made fashions crimes . In the eighteenth century there was little legis-lation against brothels , drinking places , or gambling houses . We make it a crime to sell rum , but not to drink it . On the other hand , until recently commercial transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted in accordance with ethical and economic faiths that they were environed by crimes which are now obsolete . Heresy and sorcery were once very great crimes . Witchcraft and usury were abominable crimes . 212 . Criminal law . In the original administration of justice it appears that there was only one punishment for the violation of taboo , sin and crime being coincident : that was death . Then , cases , banishment was substituted for death , although this was only a change in form , since a banished man could not exist alone . In either case the selection was of the simplest kind . The society extruded from itself one who violated its rules . This is the fundamental sense of all punishments , like execution , transportation , or imprisonment , which remove the culprit from the society , permanently or for a time . Other punishments contained originally a large element of vengeance , vengeance being a primary pulse of great force to satisfy those whom the crimes injured and to deter others from the same crime . The administration of justice , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what conduct and character should be selected for preservation or caused to cease . In all modern states the power to make acts crimes has been abused , and the motive of punishment has been so lost that we wrangle as to what it is . The ruling coteric uses the power to make things crimes to serve its own interests . Protectionists make it criminal to import goods . Governments do the same to further their fiscal purposes . They also make it criminal to immigrate or emigrate , or to coin money , even of full weight and fineness , or to carry letters and parcels . In England it is made a crime to violate railroad regulations . In some cases regulations for barber shops are enforced by making violations crimes . Generally , sanitary rules are so enforced . In the latest case it has been made a crime to spit in public places . The criminal law expresses the mores of the time when they have reached very concrete and definite formulae of prohibition . Perhaps the administration of it expresses the mores still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties do not exert proportionately deterrent effect . Our mores do not permit us inflict pain in order to compel men to confess , or to put them 2I0 FOLKWAYS in solitary confinement in dark and loathsome dungeons , or to let our prisons become sinks of vice and misery or schools of crime . The selective effect of punishment is the one which we seem to aim at , although not very intelligently . Mass phenomena of fear and hope . Manias and delusions are mental phenomena , but they are social . They are diseases of the mind , but they are epidemic . They are contagious , not as cholera is contagious , but contact with others is essential to them . They are mass phenomenal Some great hope ( the good to be obtained by taking the heads of murdered men or from appeasing the gods by sacrificing one 's children ) or some great fear ( drought , failure of food , purgatory ) , if common to the whole , makes them adopt any suggestion of a means to realize the hope or avert the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for common action . Hysteria , especially amongst women and chil-dren , produces manias of falsehood , deceit ( fasting women ) , trances , and witchcraft . In medieval convents sometimes half the inmates were afflicted at the same time . Nervous depression and irritation produced physical acts of relief . One irritated another , and one surpassed another , until there was a catastrophe for the group.2 Religious enthusiasm has produced innumerable manias and delusions . Medieval Christianity , Mohammedanism , Persia , and modern Russia furnish cases . Martyrdom proves nothing with regard to the truth or value of a religion . All the sects have had martyrs . Martyrdom , even under torture , has been sought , under the influence of religious enthusiasm , not only by Christians 3 but by Donatists , 4 Manicheans , and other most abominated heretics . Even the Adamites produced martyrs who went joyously to death.5 Quakers really provoked their own martyrdom in early New England . Manias , delusions . The phenomena of manias , popular delusions , group hallucinations , self-immolation , etc. , show the possibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope or fear which affect large numbers at the same time . // They are often produced by public calamities , or other ills of life . ' Chose who suffer feel themselves selected as victims , and they ask , Who has done this to us , and why ? Often people who are not victims interpret a natural incident by egoistic reference . This is done not on account of the destruction wrought by an earthquake or a tornado , but from pure terror at what is not understood , e.g. an eclipse . ' Pilgrimages and crusades were cases of mania and delusion . The element of delusion was in the notion of high merit which could be won in pursuing the crusades . Very often manias and delusions are pure products of fashion , as in the case of the children 's crusades , when the children caught the infec-tion of the crusades , but did not know what they were doing , or why , and rushed on their own destruction . Often manias are logical deductions from notions ( especially religious notions ) which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the ills of life which drive people to such deductions , and they bear witness to excessive nervous excitement . The mediaeval dancing mania was more purely nervous . The demonism and demonology of the Middle Ages was a fertile source for such deductions , which went far to produce the witchcraft mania . The demonistic notions taught by the church furnished popular deductions , which the church took up and reduced to dogmatic form , and returned as such to the masses . Thus the notions of sorcery , heresy , and witchcraft were developed . 215 . Monstrous mass phenomena of mediaeval society . There must have been a deep and strong anthropological reason for the development of monstrous social phenomena in mediaeval society . The Latin world was disintegrated to its first elements between the sixth century and the tenth . Such a dissolution of society abol-ished the inherited mores with all their restraints and inhibitions , and left society to the control of fierce barbaric , that is physical , forces . At the same period the Latin world absorbed hordes of barbarians who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who adopted the ruins of Roman culture without assimilating them . The Christian church contributed crass super-stitions about the other world and the relations of this world to // it . The product was the Merovingian and Carlovingian history . Passion , sensuality , ferocity , superstitious ignorance , and fear characterized the age . It is supposed that western Europe was overpopulated and that the crusades operated a beneficial reduc-tion of numbers.l These facts may account for the gigantic mass phenomena in the early Middle Ages . Every sentiment was ex-travagant . Men were under some mighty gregarious instinct which drove them to act in masses , and they passed from one great pas-sion or enthusiastic impulse to another at very short intervals . The passions of hatred and revenge were manifested , upon occasion , to the extremity of fiendishness . Nothing which the mind could conceive of seemed to be renounced as excessive ( Clement V , John XXII ) . Gregory IX pursued the heretics and the emperor with an absorption of his whole being and a rancor which we can-not understand . Poverty was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the height of ascetic absurdity , since poverty is only want , and the next step would be a cult of suicide . The mendicant orders fought each other malignantly . Every difference of opinion made a war of extermination . Civil contests were carried on with extravagant ferocity as to the means used and as to the exultation of success or the penalty of failure . What was lacking was discipline . There was no authority or doctrine which could set limits to private passion . Life was held cheap . The gallows and the pit were in use all the time . The most marked product of invention was instruments of torture . Men and women were burned to death for frivolous reasons . Punishments taught people to gloat over suffering . Torture was inflicted as idly as we take testimony . With all this went deep faith in the efficacy of ritual and great other-worldliness , that is , immediate apprehension of the other world in this one . All the mores were adjusted to these features of faith and practice . It all proceeded out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along like a chip on the tide . The church hung back from the crusades until the depth of the popular interest had been tested . Then the crusades were declared to be the " will of God . " This // gave their own idea back again to the masses with the approval of the societal authority . The masses insisted on having acts and apparatus provided by which to satisfy their application of dogma . The power of the keys and the treasure of salvation were provided accordingly . The souls of the people were torn by the antago-nism between the wild passions of the age and the ecclesiastical restraints on conduct . They feared the wrath of God and hell to come . The ritual and sacramental system furnished a remedy . The flagellants were a phenomenon of seething , popular passion , outside of the church and unapproved by its authority . Antony of Padua ( f 1231 ) started the movement by his sermons on repentance and the wrath of God . Processions of weeping , pray-ing , self-scourging , and half-naked penitents appeared in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all enemies made friends . Usurers and robbers made haste to restore ill-gotten goods , and other vicious men confessed and renounced van-ity . Prisons were opened . Prisoners were released . Exiles were allowed to return . Men and women accomplished works of pity and holiness , as if they feared the all-powerful God would con-sume them with fire from heaven . " 1 This movement was alto-gether popular . It broke out again in 1349 , in connection with the Black Death . Flagellation for thirty-three and a half days was held to purge from all sin . This was heresy and the flagel-lants were persecuted . The theory was a purely popular appli-cation by the masses of the church doctrine of penance , outside of the church system . It reappeared from time to time . The dancing mania began at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1373 and lasted for several years.2 It was an outlet for high nervous tension under which the population was suffering on account of great calamities , social distress , and superstitious interpretations of the same . In short , the period was one of monstrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gregariousness of the Middle Ages . " To estimate fully the force of these popular ebullitions in the Middle Ages , we must bear in mind the susceptibility of the people to contagious // emotions and enthusiasms of which we know little in our colder day . A trifle might start a movement which the wisest could not explain nor the most powerful restrain . It was during the preach-ing of this crusade of 1208 , against the Albigenses that villages and towns in Germany were filled with women who , unable to expend their religious ardor in taking the cross , stripped themselves naked and ran silently through the roads and streets . Still more symptomatic of the diseased spirituality of the time was the crusade of the children , which desolated thousands of homes . From vast districts of territory , incited apparently by a simultaneous and spontaneous impulse , crowds of children set forth , without leaders or guides , in search of the Holy Land ; and their only answer , when questioned as to their object , was that they were going to Jerusalem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break loose and dis-appear ; and the few who eventually found their way home again could give no reason for the overmastering longing which had carried them away . Nor must we lose sight of other and less creditable springs of action which brought to all crusades the vile , who came for license and spoil , and the base , who sought the immunity conferred by the quality of crusader . " 1 " To com-prehend fully the magnitude and influence of these movements we must bear in mind the impressionable character of the populations and their readiness to yield to contagious emotion . When we are told that the Franciscan Berthold of Ratisbon frequently preached to crowds of sixty thousand souls , we realize what power was lodged in the hands of those who could reach masses so easily swayed and so full of blind yearnings to escape from the ignoble life to which they were condemned . How the slumber-ing souls were awakened is shown by the successive waves of excitement which swept over one portion of Europe after another about the middle of the thirteenth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of hopeless and brutal misery was all that was to be realized from the promises of the gospel . The church had made no real effort at internal reform ; it was still grasping , covetous , licentious , and a strange desire // for something ? they knew not exactly what ? began to take possession of men 's hearts and spread like an epidemic from village to village and from land to land . " 1 What we see here is the power of mere gregariousness , the impulse of acting in a crowd , without knowledge or purpose . The mere sense of being in the current movement , or " in the fashion , " is a pleasure . When the movement is great in its compass and the numbers involved there is an exhilaration about being in it . If the notions by which it is enthused are great , or holy and noble , in form and pretense , even if not really so , it may become demonic , and it may accomplish incredible things . We had a grand illustration of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both in the North and South . Dissent on both sides was over-whelmed and all were swept away into the prevailing current . 217 . The mendicant orders . The mendicant orders responded to the deepest popular faiths and highest standards of the thirteenth century . Francis of Assisi ( f 1226 ) took up the notion that it was wrong to own property , or at least meritorious to re-nounce it , and affirmed that Christ and his apostles repudiated all property and lived on alms . The Timotheists of the fifth century had held this notion , but were rated as heretics.2 Poverty , for Francis , did not mean a little property , but absolute rejection of all property . This was necessarily only a pose . He had to use other men 's property , the use being right . Therefore he could only renounce productive labor . The popular religious temper of the time revered simplicity , humility , self-denial , and renunciation of " the world " as especially evangelical virtues . They were thought to be summed up in poverty . That Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universally admitted . The virtues were just the ones which the Roman court did not show . Jacques de Vitry , an enthusiastic preacher against the Albigenses , went through Italy to Palestine in 1216 . He left a journal3 In which he recorded his sadness at observing that , at the papal court , all were busy with secular affairs , kings and kingdoms , quarrels and lawsuits , so that it was almost impossible to speak 2 16 FOLKWAYS about spiritual matters . He greatly admired the Franciscans , who were trying to renew primitive Christianity and save souls , thus shaming the prelates , who were " dogs who do not bark . " The Count of Chiusi gave to Francis the mountain La Verna for retirement and meditation . Armed men were necessary to take possession of it against the beasts and robbers who had possession of it . ' Carmichael believes that Francis received the stigmata , which he describes in detail . The Francis of tradition is a fabu-lous person , created out of the pet ideas of his time .2 The historical person was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convert all heretics by preaching or other means . 218 . Other mendicant orders . De Vitry found Humiliati in Lombardy , who were living by ideas like those of Francis . The Augustinian hermits were founded in 1256 , the Carmelites in 1245 , and the Servites , or Servants of Mary , about 1275.3 These were all mendicants , and they bear witness to the character of the notions of the time about poverty . It was a mania , and is fully expressed in the Rornaunt de la Rose . Perhaps Francis did not mean to " found an order . " He wanted to live in a certain way with a few friends . The spontaneous and very rapid spread of his order proves that it was con-cordant with a great popular taste . Francis was a dreamer and enthusiast , not a politician or organizer at all . In his testament he says : " After the Lord had given me care of the brethren , no one showed me what I ought to do , but the Highest Himself revealed to me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel . " He was not thwarted and subjugated by the curia during his life , but his ideals were not maintained by the men in the order . The man who was later pope Gregory IX aided him to organize the order and to make it practically efficient , that is , to take the enthusiasm out of it and make it practical.4 The popes of the thirteenth century approved . There was in the principles of the order an antagonism to the church as it was , and also an antagonism to common sense . The church authorities wanted to bring the order into practical use , and suspected it of the heresies of Florus . It therefore split into " " conventuals , " who conformed to the methods of conventual life , and the " spirituals , " who clung to the doctrines and rules of the founder . The latter became " observantines " ( 1368 ) and " recollects " ( 1487 ) .5 The two branches hated each other and fought on all occasions . In 1275 the spirituals were treated as heretics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' John XXI I condemned their doctrine as heretical . This put the observantines in the same position as other heretical Sects . They must be rebels and heretics or give up ideas which seemed to them the sum of all truth and wisdom . Generally they clung to their ideas like the heretics.2 One of their heroes was Bernard Delicieux ( f 1320 ) , who Ix celebrated as the only man who ever dared to resist the Inquisition . He was tortured twice , and condemned to imprisonment in chains on bread and water . He lived only a few months under this punishment. $ Out of admira-tion immense sums were given to the mendicants , and they became notorious for avarice and worldly self-seeking.4 As early as 1257 Bonaventura , the head of the order , reproached them with these faults.5 " Some of the venom-ous hatred expressed by the Italian satirists for the two great orders of St. Francis and St. Dominic may perhaps be due to an ancient grudge against them as a papal police founded in the interests of orthodoxy , but the chief point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which rendered them odious to all classes of society . " 6 " In general the Franciscans seem to us far less orthodox than the Dominicans . They issued from a popular move- : ent which was irregular , unecclesiastical , very little conformed to the ideas of the hierarchy about discipline . " ( ( ( ( The followers of St. Francis continued to contain ardent-minded men who maintained that the Franciscan reform ad not produced all its due results ; that that reform was superior to popes nd to the dispensations issued at Rome ; that the appearance of the seraphic Francis was neither more nor less than the advent of a new Christianity and new Christ , like in all respects to the first , but superior to it by poverty . Therefore all the democratic and communistic movements of later times , ? the third order of St. Francis , the Beghards , Lollards , Bisocs , Fraticelli , Spirit-ual Brethren , Humiliati , and Poor Men of Lyons Waldenses , who were Exterminated by the state and the prisons of the Dominicans , have their . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the eternal gospel . " 7 219 . Popular mania for poverty and beggary . The strength of the mendicant orders was in their popularity . They recon-ottered for the church the respect of the masses . Then they became the inquisitors , and the abusers of power for their own interests , and fell into great disfavor . Their history shows well the course of interaction between the masses and the rulers , and he course of institutions born in popular mores but abused to rve private interests . The mendicant orders furnished the // army of papal absolutism . The Roman Catholic writers say that the popes saved the world from the despotism of emperors . What is true is that the pope and the emperor contendeu for the mastery , and the masses gave it to the pope . What the popes did with it we know . That is history . What the emperors would have done with it is matter for conjecture . It is very probable that they would have abused the power as badly as the popes did , but conjectural history is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most striking and recurrent examples is the belief that new and despised reli-gious sects , which are forced to meet in private , practice obscene and abominable orgies . The early Christians were accused of such rites , and they charged dissenting sects with the same.l The Manicheans , Waldenses , Huguenots , Puritans , Luciferans , Brothers of the Free Spirit , and so on through the whole list of heretical sects , have been so charged . Lea , in his History of the Inquisition , mentions over a dozen cases of such charges , some of which were true . Nowadays the same assertions are made against freemasons by Roman Catholics.2 Jews are believed by the peasants of eastern Europe to practice abominable rites in secret . The idea that secret sects use the blood of people not of their sect , especially of babies , in base rites is only a variant of the broad idea about secret rites . It is sometimes said that the charges were invented to make sects unpopular , but it is more probable that they arose from the secrecy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The story of the discovery of such misbehavior always contains the same explana-tion -a husband followed his wife to the meeting and saw the proceedings .4 Manias need suggestion . Manias and delusions are like fashions and fads in that they always seem to need a suggestion from some outside source , and often it is impossible to find such a source . A strong popular belief , like the belief in Satan and demons , furnishes a ground for a general disposition to hold some other people responsible for all the ills which befall one 's // self . Then the disposition to act cruelly against the suspected person arises to a mental disease , and by cooperation of others under the same aberration makes a mania.l The explanation lies in autosuggestion or fixed ideas with the development loosely ranged under hysteria , which is the contagious form of nervous affection . The term " epidemic " can be applied only figuratively . " Mental disease occurs only on the ground of a specific constitu-tional and generally hereditary predisposition . It can not there-fore be spread epidemically , any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to hysterical imitation . In like manner , epidemics or manias of suicide occur by imitation , e.g. amongst the Circumcellions , a subdivision of the Donatists , in Africa , in the middle of the fourth century A.D.3 Cognate with this was the mania for martyrdom which it required all the authority of the church to restrain.4 Josephus 5 says of the Gali-leans , followers of Judas of Galilee , that they were famous for their indifference to death . Convents were often seats of fright-ful epidemics of hysteria . The accepted religious notions fur-nished a fruitful soil for it . To be possessed by devils was a distinction , and vanity was drawn into play.6 Autosuggestion was shown by actions which were , or were supposed to be , the actions proper for " possessed " people . Ascetic practices pre-pared the person to fall a victim to the contagion of hysteria . The predisposition was also cultivated by the religious ecstasies , the miracle and wonder faiths , and the current superstitions . Then there was the fact which nearly any one may have experi-enced , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he thinks that what he heard of happened to himself . Untrained people also form strong convictions from notions which have been long and firmly held without evidence , and they offer to others the firmness of their own convictions as grounds for accepting the same faith without proof . Ritual acts and ascetic observances which others can see , also conduct and zeal
