txt American Machine &; Foundry Co. has completed plans for the first nuclear research reactor to be wholly owned and operated by a group of-privatelsompanies , Gen. Walter Bedell Smith , vice chairman of AMP , announced . The reactor will be ' wad only for research purposes investigating aspects of atomic energy in industry . It will not be a part of a plant to produce electricity . The reactor and supporting laboratory will cost between $1 million and $1.5 million . It can be constructed and put into operation within 18 months , the company said . Called Industrial Reactor Research Facility , it is planned for the New York area on a site of approximately 250 acres . No location was announced . AMF has invited an undisclosed number of Industrial companies to participate in the facility . The reactor will be a separate unit run by a board of directors representing the member companies , AMP explained . In addition to building the reactor , AMP will participate in the program . There will be no avernment subsidy , AMF said . " Tifis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atomic energy field , " an AMF spokesman declared . Participating companies will be able to look into new fields , acquire know-how and work with atomic energy , he explained . " Industry can get a tremendous amount of information with tools like this , " he added . AMF said participating companies will be from the electronics , petroleum , food , pharmaceutical , chemical , ceramics , rubber , metals . textile , agricultural machinery and other industries . The reactor will have a permanent central staff . For special experiments , the companies may assign other scientists to the facility , it was explained . Gen. Smith said the program will have to be licensed by the Atomic Energy Commission , under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 . The new law also requires that reactor operators be licensed . The reactor facility will study applications of atomic energy to sterilization and pasteurization of foods , chemistry , medicine , reactor technology , processing of drugs , production of plastics and other industrial processes . " We envision the development of many new and important commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrial processes , * Gen. Smith said . Except for university reactors , all reactors now in operation are owned by the A.E.C. AMP explained that this industrial research reactor will not come under the Power Demonstration Reactor Program announced last month by the A.E.C. This program offers government aid to private firms willing to develop and operate their own experimental power reactors .
