" Everything seems to be in fine shape , " said Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Felix Stump . " When the bell rings , we will be ready to go . " This week the bell rang for the Chinese Nationalists to evacuate the Tachen Islands with the help of the U.S. Seventh Fleet . <P> Before the bell , there was an anxious wait for 1 ) the payoff on a major U.S. gamble that Red China would turn down the U.N . invitation to discuss ceasefire , and 2 ) agreement between the U.S. and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek on defense of the offshore islands . <P> Predicted Bellicosity . Last fortnight U.S. prestige among free Asian peoples plummeted when President Eisenhower endorsed the idea of U.N . cease-fire talks . If Red China 's Chou En-lai had accepted the U.N . invitation under the New Zealand resolution , he would have won wide international backing for a seat in the U.N . and , perhaps , a neutralized Formosa , a sitting duck for Chou to bag when he pleased . <P> But U.S. policymakers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make the bellicose decision . He did . Having committed himself to grab Formosa by force of arms , he would not trade that threat for the enormous diplomatic and propaganda advantages that might have followed Communist acceptance of a cease fire agreement . <P> Chou 's belligerent refusal of the U.N . invitation last week was coupled with the demand that he be seated in the U.N . to discuss a Russian resolution charging the U.S. with aggression in the Far East . But the U.S. was in a good position to counter this proposal . Having placed itself on the side of peace , the U.S. could from now on make its power felt in the Pacific . <P> On the heels of this Communist setback last week came another face-loser for the Reds . Two of eight MIG planes that at tacked a U.S. patrol plane and its escort over the Yellow Sea were splashed by U.S. Sabres , and the rest were routed . <P> Spiked Spearhead . Meanwhile , the U.S. had diplomatic difficulties of its own in the form of a thorny negotiation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last September the U.S. decided that the islands of Quemoy and Matsu were not militarily vital to the defense of Formosa . Later , as a condition to giving up the Tachens , Chiang demanded a public U.S. promise to defend Quemoy and Matsu . Politically , this was a reasonable condition , for with the Tachens gone , the other islands , as well as having tactical value , would become a test in the minds of free Asians of U.S. will to resist more Red thrusts . <P> Three times the U.S. was on the point of announcing that it would defend Quemoy and Matsu , but at the last moment Dwight Eisenhower , to soothe British fears , vetoed it . He thought U.S. intentions were already clear enough " to make certain that no conflict occurs through mistaken calculations on the other side . . . We have been as exact as it seems possible to be .
