To the five U.S. correspondents in Moscow , the meeting last week of Russia 's Supreme Soviet was a quiet story-until Chairman Volkov stepped forward and read Malenkov 's resignation . Led by United Press Correspondent Kenneth Brodney. the newsmen bolted for the door , raced down four flights of stairs , and ran across three large Kremlin courtyards to their cars . While they scribbled notes , Russian chauffeurs sped them over the city 's slush-covered streets to the Central Telegraph Office . Brodney got there first , put through a phone call to London and scored a clean 19-minute beat in the U.S. with the news . <P> To keep the copy moving , U.P . held open a Moscow-London telephone line for 7 hours ( at $1.65 a minute ) . Between bulletins , staffers talked about the weather , sports , food and anything else they could think of . Other newsmen tied up the three other telephone lines to London for so long that foreign diplomats in Moscow could not phone reports home to their governments . In Washington , the State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Ambassador Charles E. Bohlen got his official report through . <P> A Hint . The New York Times , which had already printed its last edition , got the wire-service stories in time to put out 24,400 copies of a " Late City Extra " with a 450-word bulletin dropped into Page One . The Times Sunday Magazine hastily pulled a Seventh Fleet picture off its front cover , substituted one of Bulganin , Mao and Khrushchev . The Russian censors , swamped by the flood of words , let many a piece of copy slip through which ordinarily might have been spiked ; e.g. , A.P . reported : " Muscovites questioned at random appeared bored at the news . ' What difference does it make ? ' one asked . Another said : ' It 's all the same thing . ' " <P> Although most editors had an inkling of internal tensions in the Soviet high command ( TIME , Feb. 7 ) , only three newsmen were directly tipped off . Publisher William R. Hearst Jr. , his aide , Frank Coniff. and his chief European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a brief visit to Russia got a tip from Khrushchev himself . In an interview three days before the change , for no apparent reason , Khrushchev mysteriously suggested they interview Bulganin , and added that " probably early next week " would be a good time to see him . They made no mention of this in their dispatches , instead reported : " Khrushchev . . . ridicules the Western reports of a split between him and . . . Malenkov . " <P> On Order . The change touched off such a rash of punditing and often conflicting views that Scripps-Howard Columnist Frederick C. Othman wrote : " One consolation about this Malenkov blowup in Moscow is the undisputed fact that I personally know as much about it as any of the alleged Russian experts . " <P> In Russia , newspapers and radio stations did not carry the news until hours after it was printed in newspapers all over the West . When it did appear , Communist editors had no trouble finding out exactly how to play the story . Over the Moscow radio came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow 's papers should publish on their first page the picture of the joint meeting of the Supreme Soviet with Mr. Molotov on the rostrum . . . Next should follow the Khrushchev speech . Underneath , the appointment of Comrade Bulganin . . . "
