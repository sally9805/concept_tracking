Burlesque Boss Harold Minsky has no prejudice against home-grown talent , but at Las Vegas ' Dunes Hotel the foreign-born element in his chorus line is the spice of the show ( " People enjoy talking to them " ) . So last month Minsky* took off on a recruiting trip to Europe , returned last week with a report that was part showbusinesslike , part sociological . Said he : " Europe is one big striptease . Hamburg looks like 52nd Street in the wild days ; Paris is one strip joint after another . " <P> But Explorer Minsky 's standards are high ( " Her limbs , " he says of the ideal stripper , " must be tapered rose stems , and her ankles sufficiently narrow so that an ordinary man 's hand can completely close around them " ) , and Harold was disillusioned by what he found . " The girls just are n't as pretty as I 'd expected . I do n't know whether it was what they went through in the war , or what , but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burlesque Baedeker in brief : Germany- " The girls are awful ; there 's no taste to their numbers . They just strip . All those great big girls lumber around like cows . " Italy- " I do n't know why , but they import all their strippers . Italian girls are only interested in the movies . It 's like Hollywood 15 years ago ; every girl is a starlet . I did n't meet one who did n't claim to have been in Ben Hur . " Denmark- " The emphasis is on vaudeville acts . One of the best had a man in an upper berth peering at a girl in a lower as she got ready for bed . They have lots of creative imagination over there . Danish girls are a cross between the English and French , but they 're prettier than either . " England- " The girls just are n't very sexy . The shows are all in private clubs , and they 're uninhibited . But the girls have little expression , and they do n't move too well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass . Strippers work as many as four clubs a night . They travel between joints like the Club Sexy and the Club Blushing , carrying their little bags like doctors . " <P> <P> * Son of the original Abe Minsky ( 1888-1949 ) , the Barnum of burlesque .
