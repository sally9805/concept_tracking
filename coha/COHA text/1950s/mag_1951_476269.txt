ARCHAEOLOGISTS , during the course of their lives , see and hear many strange things , but the fact that they are scientific men keeps them for the most part silent . They have good , if not superior , rationalizations for the things they do . No layman would dare impugn their motives . I , for example , have a certain number of skulls in my possession . As I write I can see four on the shelf above me . I know of two certainly hidden in my filing cabinet , and there is a beautiful fragment on my desk which is often fondled by visitors who are unaware of its human significance . Now as it happens I am fortunate . I practice a trade which enables me to keep these objects about in a perfectly logical and open manner . I have not murdered to possess them , and if one or two were acquired in dark and musty places my motives , as I have hinted , are beyond reproach . As an archaeologist I can be both a good citizen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the man who finally led me to question my own motives as a skull collector . He was a lawyer but that , perhaps , has little to do with the tale . I knew him as an austere , high-collared member of the bar ? a moral and upright citizen ? but that , I am afraid , has little to do with it either . The truth is that the gentleman left a box . He died , it seems , and after the passage of a certain number of months during which the box either lay undiscovered in his attic or , as is more likely , circulated uneasily through the hands of his heirs , I received a call about it . There was nothing unusual in this . I was simply not a policeman . When you are the heir to a considerable estate and unfortunately also have a box to be disposed of , you never go to a policeman . You go instead to an archaeologist . He is apt to be more understanding of human frailty , less prone to dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will relieve you of the box . If you have ever wandered the streets of a strange city with a parcel of this nature , you will appreciate the fact that there are very few human beings who can be trusted to relieve you of such a burden without either screaming or making some other hideous public commotion . Naturally you wish to avoid this . There are only two solutions : bury the box ( an act which can lead to serious complications , including the suggestion of guilt ) or find an archaeologist , smile trustingly , and deposit it in his arms . T HE heirs in this case pursued the inevitable pathway . They came to me . The legal gentleman and I had had mutual friends . My profession was known . Perhaps the property was really mine . Attics , you know , and the things that get into them . A loan perhaps ? Some lodge doings ? I preserved a non-committal air . " Uncle Tobias was a church man . He would not tolerate ? " Yes , I said , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the box . " It is very unlikely that his profession would have brought him into contact with ? ? " " And him a lawyer ? " I said . " Nothing likelier . " The niece 's hands twisted . " Show him , " she prompted . It was the real thing , of course , and no lodge fake . As fine a skull as I 've ever fondled . " You recognize it ? " they cried hopefully . " We are glad to restore it to your collection . " Almost they started up . " Hmmmm , " I said . They subsided nervously . " The jaw , you see . It does n't ? " MAGAZINE " Does n't what ? " the nephew challenged . " I 'm sure it 's just like you loaned it to him . " " It 's not mine , " I said bluntly , " and besides that tell you something . There are two of them ? individually represented , I mean . The jaw does n't fit the skull . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color it 's out of a different grave . " " Two of them , " murmured the niece . " Out of a different grave , " repeated the nephew . I waited patiently . After a time he came to the point . Some see it more rapidly than others . " I guess Uncle Tobias was uh ? uh ? a collector , " he said . " We should now like to present his collection to you ? or your institution ? anonymously , of course . " " Of course , " I said . " Would you like a receipt ? Would you like to take the box back with you ? " " Thank you , no , " said the niece . " You 're too kind . And it will be an anonymous gift ? " " We have many of them , " I said . " Many of them . " As they went down the steps I saw them walking more lightly . Their arms swung better without the burden . They ran to the car at the curb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich old brown , I saw as my hand went over it ? a rich old mahogany brown . They need n't have been so jittery ? that skull had been hundreds of years underground when Uncle Tobias was born . But where had he got it ? and that jaw from another body ? " There 's no accounting , " I said , " for tastes . Tobias must have been a collector . " I said it disapprovingly to the wall closet . Then I picked the skull up and put it inside . I was not , you see , a genuine collector . My motivations were purely scientific and unemotional . Or were they ? I went back to the desk and sat down . I could see Uncle Tobias 's long-hidden relic staring back vacantly at me through the glass door of the cabinet . It would never tell its secret , but it had one . It had a secret and so had Uncle Tobias . And I ? Perhaps I was a keeper of secrets . Or of orphans , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And at last I knew where it had begun . Behind the steady chipping of the pick that began to sound in my ears was another sound ? the creaking of weathered timbers and the uneasy movement of stormy air in a closed place . That would be it , I thought suddenly ? the heads in Hagerty 's barn . II W HEN Grandma was alone in the kitchen we used to bake heads together in the kitchen stove . When I first approached her on this matter she naturally demurred , but in the end her cooking enthusiasm got the better of her and she would line them up like biscuits in a pie tin and put them in the oven . It was before the days of Charles Addams and we never conceived of ourselves as monsters . It is probably true , however , that it was at this time I developed a mild antipathy for the normal human skull . This was not my grandmother 's fault . In fact , at times , out of some lingering religious scruple she would protest the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door now and then and peering in , partly to see that they were properly done and partly to grumble over their strangeness . They were clay , burnt clay , and modeled as well as a boy could model skulls he had never handled . Some of them had matchstick teeth or bits of pearl shell from broken buttons . The eyes were the hollow eyes of skulls and the mandibles were shaped as I thought they should be shaped , from drawings in the red brick museum that I frequented . As for thecranium itself , practically everything I made was slope-browed and primitive . Even today I am apt to be faintly repelled by skulls with no brow ridges , or teeth of too delicate a cast . " Mind you , " Grandma would protest , tapping me with a roasting fork , " this is getting out of hand . Them 's no ordinary heads in there and no young'un can tell me so . They 've got that look , they have . That Darwin look . You be staying out of that building now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen ? not by anybody . " You 've got to stop , it , youngster , " she would say finally , and swing the range door shut with a great clang . " You 've got to stop it ' fore the Devil gets you by the foot . That little one there looks no more'n half a man . Where 'd you find him , boy ? Speak out now . Not from any book in this house , I 'll warrant . " " No , Grandma , honest not . " " Where then ? " " The room , Grandma , the room in the Museum . I climbed up on the railing and looked close . His head was just like that ? no forehead ? and there was a big card with long words , and there was another headordinary ? a plain old ordinary head beside him ? " " That 's enough , boy , that 's enough . They 're done now . Get ' em out of the house . Take ' em away . Out of doors now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I NEVER did . I put them in a little bag I carried and then I went halfway down the block to Hagerty 's barn . It was an old sagging weatherbeaten stable , locked up and unused . I knew where a board could be edged aside , however , and there was just room enough to scrape in and let the board drop in place behind me . I always waited then until my eyes were adjusted to the light that came in through cracks and knotholes . In the spring when the light came in through the leaves outside it made a kind of green-lit secrecy . Then I would take the bag of heads in my teeth and climb by way of some nailed crosspieces way up into the shadows under the roof . There was a half-loft up there ? pretty rickety , but it would still bear a boy 's weight . I could see after a while , even in that light . and then I would open the hag and take out the heads . No one but Grandma and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for painstaking accuracy , it was only because without it the things seemed less real , less alive somehow . They were smaller than life , the size of big marbles , perhaps . Nevertheless they had a peculiar significance to me , a kind of being ? the anima that exists in all properly shaped miniatures . Up there under the barn roof I laid them out in little rows along the cross-beams . It was my museum , like the red brick museum that my grandmother feared . Only in my museum nothing was dead . It was filled with a kind of patient , unwinking persistence ? the persistence of a half-bewitched league of jack-o ' - lantern faces waiting for me to come and sit with them in the green light high in the loft . In the end I deserted them . There was no help for it . We moved away in what , to my mother , was a small triumph . I had no luggage of my own and no place to conceal the heads . I can still remember that white , frosty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled on its way toward the station . Away over the edge of the trees I could see the broken wind vane on Hagerty 's stable , pointing steadily , as it always did , in one direction , no wind ever turning it . The heads were there . They would be there till the building fell . " We will never come back here , son . Never . " My mother 's voice rang over the cobblestones . But all the time I could feel the secret drawing of those heads in Hagerty 's stable . They would be there in the gray light and the green light ; they wotild be there till the building fell . III F AINTER than spider silk to my nearsighted gaze , the map lines run under the magnifying glass across a tumbled expanse of Southwestern desert and lava beds . Names like Big Hatchet and Buckhorn still bring that vast and ominous landscape into my mind . Though the white man has taken it , it will never be rid of the ghosts of its last owners ? the Apache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nameless peaks and in the red clay of the washes . Cochise , Victorio , Nana , and Geronimo will haunt it always . In the seventies of the last century many men died here . Dozens of others , the historians say , were never accounted for ? the desert swallowed them up . Old Mr. Harney knew ; he had been one of the missing . But it was from his family that I first got a hint of his story . " He keeps her in the china closet , " one of them told me , " right with the dishes . " " Kinfolk , " sniffed another , with a gesture of distaste . " The skull of Aunt Melvina , " explained a grandson with less heat . " He never buried her . " " Oh ? " I said , puzzled and tactful while the relatives all chattered together . They would have to make it clear . I had come at their invitation . " He liked meeting you , " they finally got out in chorus . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . " The skull , " they countered . " He wo n't bury it . But he 's curious about your work . Maybe you could persuade him to give it to you . He 's restless about it . Old , you know , quite old . We do n't like having her there . It is n't right . Nor proper . People say ? " They tapped their heads in unison like little marionettes. 44 , T WAS barbed wire , " Mr. Harney said , " it was barbed wire finished our world . " He was eighty years old , and the skull lay on the table before us . We sat silent , gazing out into the clear white desert sunlight . Eighty years , I thought , and reached out and turned the skull gently over . Years of smoking pistols and Apaches riding fast through the narrow arroyos . " You have lived a long life , " I said . He sighed then , and began talking ? the merest wisp of a sound . I leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley after the haul from Texas , and me a youngster of ten . Mother dead on the trail . Her younger sister , Aunt Melvina , raised me ? the old man meanin ' well but ridin ' ? ridin ' most of the time . It took plenty ridin ' to hold things together without the wire . " Sure , we knew there was Apaches in the hills , always was . But people had a way of stickin ' . A way ? " he paused and reached out as if to touch the nearest blue hill ? " as though they liked somethin ' there ? the air , maybe , so clear , or all that land at sunset , or maybe the feel of it , no fence from Texas to the Big Horns . Or maybe , like me , you had just followed along ' cause your people was moving and they was your people and you did n't go askin " em why their names changed along those little roads from the East . " Melvina was young and pretty with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as good to me as my own mother . Young enough to play and imagine things the way a kid will . When my father was gone she used to play in the yard with me . Aaahh " ? the old man got out something between a sigh and a groan ? " it did n't last long . " One night Pa did n't come home . Nobody knows what that means any more . They ca n't . The miles of darkness creeping in , and a woman and a kid sittin ' in a shack waitin ' for a man that ai n't comin ' back no more . You sit there and you dassent light the light for fear of drawin ' em . And all the time you know they know about you , and it 's no good , they 'll take their time . " They got us in the morning , in the first light , with Melvina standin ' out there lookin ' for Pa . One of ' em just picked her off out of the bushes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my head , so that sometimes I see it like now , with people and things of years later all shadows , and just me with my hand at my mouth , and that shot . She stood there a minute all young and pretty with her hands stretched out to me . And all that love flowed up in her a minute and held her as if she would n't fall , and I ran toward her not thinkin ' of anything except , as a kid will , that in the circle of such love I must be safe . " And then she just gave a little sigh and that light went out of her and she pitched face down into a clump of prickly pear . They took me then , squalling and kicking , and put me on a horse . After that I was an Apache till I was fifteen . " T HE faded old eyes turned slowly over the whole compass of the horizon as though they remembered every peak and gully . He did n't offer to go on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " We rode into Old Mexico . They was Victorio 's men . And I learned to be an Apache . Kids learn quick . That 's why I lived . Ride , shoot , steal . Live on nothing . Trust nobody , and keep ridin ' - keep ridin ' . South of the border , north of the border , it was all the same . " Apaches ! Y'know son , that 's a joker . We was n't Apaches . We was a way of life . We lived so hard that half the kids in camp was stolen . Most of ' em Mexicans , gotten south of the border . Raised Apaches . It was the only way to keep our strength up . " Maybe I was a little old . Maybe I remembered too much . Anyhow I used to see Victoria watching me . " Again he paused , searching his memories . " You know , in the end I did n't hate them . I was beginning to look at it the way they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shot at a lot and seen Indian families and kids I knew appear . In the end I would have stayed with them , I guess . I spoke the language by then . I could get along . " He stopped and whispered to himself a moment in syllables that were not English . Then he went on . " Vittorio must have thought different . Either that or he 'd taken a shine to me ? I never knew . He was a great warrior and Geronimo was nothing compared to him . He was hard , but there was a kind of bigness in him . When I was fifteen we were sitting on our horses one day looking down into a little town from the hills . I could see people in the streets , and smoke in chimneys . We watched it like animals must watch people ? curious and sharp and wild . I watched like everyone else , ready to vanish at the least sign of danger . " The next thing I knew , Victorio had edged his horse up beside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft and low and search , ing my face with his eyes . ' Do you re-member ? ' " And I looked at him and was afraid , and suddenly the face of Melvina came to me and I looked back at him , speaking Apache , and I said , ' Yes , I remember . ' " And he nodded , a little sad , and said , They are your people . Go down to them . ' Then he spoke a word behind me and the thirty people of his band were gone . " ' I do n't know how ? ' I said . ' My people , ' I said , and stopped . It came to me that all the people I had were Apache , and that I was Apache , too . " Not a muscle of Victorio 's face moved , but I have never forgotten what he did then . ' Those are your people , ' he said pointing . ' We killed your father and the black-haired one . The white men will take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With that he whirled his horse . I never saw him again . " After a little while I picked my way down and spoke some words of English . It was slow work , like an old hinge squeaking in the wind . People came up to me and stared at my rags and at the pony . " Harney paused , considering , then he said flatly , " It was n't so uncommon then ? changing sides like that . There was room for two lives , and sometimes you had no choice . I got to be a white man even if I was a little late catchin ' up . It was really about the same life : ride , shoot , kill . No difference , really , none to amount to anything . Not then , anyhow . " H is eyes came almost shut against the midday heat shimmer that was beginning to roil the air out on the flats . I was afraid he was beginning to lose interest and go to sleep . I pushed the skull toward him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You promised to tell me about the skull . It 's a nice thing . Well cared for , too . A woman I take it . Young . You can tell by the basilar suture . See ? " His eyes opened a little way , defensively , I thought . " Aahh , " he said again in that voice I was beginning to learn meant something hurt him . " It was afterward , sometime , that the thought came to me . I rode back to the old place . Nobody had been there all those years . And I found her ? a few little bits of white bone , that is , and the skull in a drift of sand with the prickly pear grown over it . The hair , " and with this he put up a careful , stroking finger , " was all gone . You would n't think it would go away so fast . For a while I looked around . " Then it came on me I should bury her ? and she out in the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was there to bury , really ? And besides this is a big wide land where you see miles as long as you can see at all . Every day of your life you see that way . And it is hard to be underground afterward . I had lived on the land enough to know . " In the end I knew I could n't bury her there . She was the only kin I had , so I took her up carefully and rode back with her . I figured at first maybe I 'd have it done in a proper ceremony with a churchyard and a preacher to ease it a little . " But then I could n't . I could n't face up to it . I kept putting it off and getting that feeling that if I did bury her she would go away ; that she would n't be real any longer . I settled on this place finally and I kept Melvina safe in the china closet . She never had to be afraid any more , and she could look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm a grown man , but that I did not get over , do you see ? though I know all 's dark in the grave and this is cold bone on the table top . I have a wife and sons , but this I will not bear ? that they should put her under the ground with me . " He reached out and clutched my wrist and I cursed my easy juggling with anatomy a moment before . One of the family made a sign to me from the doorway . I stood up then and took his hand and said quickly , by way of comfort , " She will not want to look through the glass at strange faces . Let her go with you . One can stay too long in the sun . " " Aahh , " he said blindly , and took her back into his hands , fumbling . " It 's plain you are not one of the open people , or you would not say that . It 's the wire , " he said , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come out of the grass beside us . " It 's the wire that 's made a difference . No wire from Texas to the Big Horns . It was all space and bright sun . " A granddaughter led him away . WOULD N'T have taken old man Harney 's skull , even if he had offered it to me , for anything in the world . He had assumed a personal responsibility there that was not transferable . I knew too much of the story , and yet I was not part of it . Young Aunt Melvina would have haunted me . Not physically , perhaps , but with that kind of intangible loneliness that comes of knowing about events behind you in time that you can never alter or intrude within , and yet there is somebody there you know or love , or wishgreatly to have comforted , but it is back behind you and of all things the loneliest . So I left Harney with that burden as all men are left with it . It was his time , and he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , years later , I have some intimation of the emotions that had shaken him . I get them all out : the massive unknown skull I once rescued from a medical dissecting room and which bears the look of the Cro-Magnon past about it ; I touch with fondness a mineralized skull vault whose age I can never prove but that rolled , I well know , for ages in the glacial gravels of the Platte . I look at them all , these silent masks whose teeth I have mended , and whose mortal rags I have bolstered with preservatives . Where will they go after the years of comfort ? these fading , anonymous individuals who have somehow come to have a claim upon me ? Scientifically they are worthless , for museums scrutinize with ever greater care the credentials of the bones which are donated to their skull rooms . What chance has a dissecting room specimen without a pedigree ? Should I hide him as Tobias did , in the attic , and hope for a kinder time ? Should I seek to protect him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see the problem . And it 's a burden , too . I realize it more as I get older , and I know , now , why Tobias the lawyer left that unrecorded legacy in his attic . What else could he do ? Most people do n't look at these things in the same way , and it 's just as well they do n't . Otherwise we 'd be like certain Indian tribes who had to move the cemetery with them when they migrated . The attitude is easier to catch than you think . I know two men who have moved dead wives . Generally I ca n't refuse skulls that are offered to me . It 's not that I am morbid , or a true collector , or that I need many of them in my work . It is just that in most cases , people being what they are , I know the skulls are safer with me . Call it a kind of respect for the bones , ingrained through long habit . That , I guess , is the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're delicate , and not in a position to defend themselves . So I look out for them . I 'd do as much for you .
