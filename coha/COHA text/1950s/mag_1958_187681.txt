Clyde Martin Reed Jr. , 44 , seemed shy and diffident to Kansas Republicans who remembered his outgoing and handsome father , the late crusading editor ( Parsons Sun ) , able Governor ( 1929-31 ) and well-known U.S. Senator ( 1939-49 ) . But Junior , now the Sun 's publisher , did his best . He took a public-speaking course , worked so hard for the Republican nomination for Governor that he got home only six nights in the last three months of the campaign , traveled 30,000 miles and walked two pairs of soles off his shoes . Last week , by a vote of 147,438 to 35,085 , he walloped one-term ( 1954-57 ) Governor Fred Hall , who had thoroughly split the party in 1956 to lose his second-term bid to Democrat George Docking . <P> Reed 's huge majority welded the Kansas Republican Party together in a way to threaten , for the first time , Democrat Docking 's hope of becoming Kansas ' first two-term Democratic Governor in November . The last three Democratic Governors in orthodox Republican Kansas , recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee , were beaten by Republicans from his area . One of them by his own father . <P> Kansas ' former State Democratic Chairman , Marvin A. ( " Mike " ) Harder , 36 , professor of political science at the Municipal University of Wichita , last week lost his own precinct committeeman 's seat to Donald E. Anderson , 23 . Winner Anderson 's oddest qualification : he earned his political science degree last June after racking up a high grade in the political parties course taught by Professor Harder .
