In Cuba 's Sierra Maestra mountains last week , a Roman Catholic priest lived with and ministered to the band of rebels led by Fidel Castro . In Colombia a cardinal of the church heard the warm praise extended by a people who regard him as a ranking hero of the revolution that tossed out Dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla . From Cuba to Argentina , the church is taking a critical look at its old role as friend of the top dog and is often charting a new , antidictatorial course . <P> In official church doctrine the change is rooted in the Rerum novarum encyclical of Pope Leo XIII , who in 1891 urged fairer treatment of such working masses as largely inhabit Latin America . In vigorous execution in Latin America , the policy is only about two years old and is rooted in the Vatican 's conviction that dictatorships and poverty breed Communism . " Experience has taught , ' ' says a high Vatican spokesman , " that a system of freedom is in the end best for church interests . Any privilege that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset by hatred against the church . " <P> Pern 's Lesson . The bitter object lesson that brought this awakening was Argentine Dictator Juan Domingo Pern . Supported by the church at first , he later grew furious at Catholic meddling in political affairs . The strongman slapped taxes on Catholic property , tossed priests out of the country and set his bullyboys to burning churches . In today 's Argentina priests who fought Pern are now the dominant force in the church . <P> Church leaders in Colombia showed striking courage during the final year of Dictator Rojas Pinilla . Pastoral letters issued by Crisanto Cardinal Luque last year , one of them condemning Rojas ' " Third Force ' ' political movement , were the first serious whacks at the strongman 's prestige . During the brief spate of violence the churches sheltered rebels , and when it was all over jubilant monks streamed out making victory signs to the cheering crowds . Luque has since warned the military junta that replaced Rojas that it must turn over power in free elections or lose church support . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Latin American clergy as a whole the church 's " biggest single blot , " the new ways are spreading . In Havana , Manuel Cardinal Arteaga has avoided taking sides , but Archbishop Enrique Prez Serantes of Santiago specifically condemned government violence in a pastoral letter last month . Most of the priests in Oriente province openly sympathize with Rebel Leader Castro . In Venezuela the leading Catholic prelate , Caracas Archbishop Rafael Arias , dared to condemn the stern dictatorship of Marcos Pern Jimnez for the inequitable distribution of the country 's great wealth .
