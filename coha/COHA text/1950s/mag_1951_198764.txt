GOD 'S MEN ( 375 pp. - Pearl Buck-John Day ( $3.50 ) . <P> Millionaire Clem Miller had a sick stomach and could n't eat much himself , but he believed that people everywhere should have all the food they wanted without having to " ask for it or even work for it . " His millionaire brother-in-law , William Lane , the newspaper-chain owner , could n't help thinking Clem a crackpot . Lane thought people ought to work for their groceries . Novelist Pearl Buck leaves no doubt where she stands on this issue : her hero is Clem , who dies trying to sell the idea ( to Roosevelt and Truman , among others ) that so long as people 's bellies are full , " almost any government would do . " Publisher Lane , an Episcopalian unaccountably " reared in Calvinism and predestination , " gets his comeuppance when his elemental " loneliness " drives him to embrace Roman Catholicism . <P> God 's Men is an exercise in puppetry rather than novel writing . Both William and Clem are raised in Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprung straight from Horatio Alger , while wellborn William is a selfish cad twisted by a Buck-chosen set of inferiority complexes . In the U.S. , ruthless William goes to Harvard , achieves power through snobbery , a calculated money marriage and fabulous success in the newspaper business . Clem starts at a poor farm , but in some vague way bumbles to millions by dealing in surplus food . He even gets Henrietta , William 's plain sister , through a correspondence courtship . <P> Last year Novelist Buck suggested that the U.S. drop the Voice of America and put up a chain of dime stores all over Asia , instead . As fiction , God 's Men has about the same oversimplified simplicity . The Retail Bookseller , which exists to give the real dope to the trade , has a laconic line for this one : " Not Grade-A Buck . "
