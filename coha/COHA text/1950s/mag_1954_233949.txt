Lordly Rafael Leonidas Trujillo , longtime dictator of the Dominican Republic , has had a generally critical U.S. press ever since 1930-Year One of the Era of Trujillo , as the country 's official documents call it . But he has not lacked for private defenders in the U.S. " He can be a charming fellow , " one explained recently . " You can get drunk with him , sing songs , swap gamy jokes . The picture is n't all black . He 's done a lot of good for the country . " El Benefactor Trujillo kept order and paid his debts , the refrain went on , and above all , he was a friend of the U.S. and U.S. business . <P> Last week the dictator callously pulled the rug out from under his apologists . Four new Trujillo laws went into effect , aimed squarely at the two U.S. sugar companies-the West Indies Sugar Corp . and the South Porto Rico Sugar Co. - which grow and mill 70% of the country 's sugar . One of the new laws empowers Trujillo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills for health-code infractions ; another requires the companies to pay production taxes on their full sugar quotas whether the mills are running or not . Two other laws levy a 15% income tax on top of the production tax , and require that Dominicans be hired as superintendents and supervisors with the same salaries and privileges as the foreigners they replace . <P> Even more far-reaching is a threat to the companies that has been boiling up for the past few months : a program Trujillo calls land reform . Having made the gesture of turning over 59 parcels of his own sugar holdings to loyal Trujillistas , the Benefactor now wants the U.S. companies to give up part of their land to local planters , for compensation to be determined later . <P> With Trujillo 's press attacking them steadily , and with his sanitary inspectors likely to drop in any time to assess heavy fines for a loose roof tile or a leaky pipe , the U.S. companies can not be sure what their eventual fate may be . This week representatives of West Indies and South Porto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting at which they hope to find out what the Benefactor really wants-and why the boss so often defended as friendly to business has been giving business the business .
