txt A former undersecretary of the treasury and four other men have proposed a $10,000,000,000 cut in next year 's federal budget , starting with abrupt cancellation of all nonmilitary spending programs . The group called for prompt withdrawal of the federal government from the field of lending , a deep cut in the public works program , drastic curtailment of federal grants and subsidies , and an end to the federal purchase of commodities under the farm price-support program . The drastic steps were advanced in a study entitled : " Financing Defense : Can Expenditures Be Reduced ? " It was made public ? by the Committee on Federal Tax Policy , headed by Roswell Magill , who was undersecretary of the treasury in 1937-38 . His associates on the privately organized committee are Fred W. Fairchild , profesgor emeritus of economics at Yale University ; Rowland R. Hughes , comptroller of the National City Bank of New York ; Walter A. Cooper , New York accountant , and Thomas N. Tarleau , former treasury tax legislative counsel . Congress Urged to Act The group urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law requiring expenditures or appropriations  --  with the exception of interest on the national debt , direct military expenditures , and international aid . Then , the committee said : " Congress , with the cooperation of the President , would ask the budget bureau to prepare a new budget on a clean-slate basis , with no commitments to any program or group , the total being $10,000 , - 000,000 below the $71,600,000,000 now proposed . " Congress would then consider the revised proposals on a clean-slate basis and would permit no additional expenditures not proposed by the budget bureau , unless a corresponding amount were cut from other budget bureau proposal ls . " Previous Commitments Mr. Magill said in an accompanying statement that such an approach is " a sheer necessity at this time . " He added : ? " Few people seem to realize that some $35,000,000,000 in the proposed budget comes from previous authorizations and commitments . making it virtually impossible for the present Congress to effect needed reductions in these areas . To avoid an intolerable tax burden Congress must act firmly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already has been in session more than two months and appropriations for the regular operations of government are under intensive study by House Appropriations subcommittees . The new fiscal year in which the appropriations will take effect begins in less than four months , on next July 1 . The administration has not yet submitted detailed estimates on proposed military and foreign-aid outlays . Mr. Magill 's committee said a $10,000,000,000 budget cut will " leave intact all the government that our free nation requires . " A somber warning to the Massachusetts Legislature to exercise extreme caution in voting any additional heavy expenditures in view of limited tax resources of the state was sounded today by the Special Commission on Taxation . The commission , in a report . gave a comprehensive picture of existing tax resources in Massachusetts . It . warned that " unless the trend of business activity , employment , sales , and effective buying income in Massachusetts can be improved , in terms of comparison with other states , the commonwealth may find it difficult to continue to offer its present range of governmental services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing sacrifices , as compared with those in other states , upon the part of business and individual taxpayers . " Second Report Due The report will be followed on Thursday , it is understood , by another commission report regarding the Massachusetts state income tax . The 15-man commission is headed by Senator Richard I. Fur-bush ( R ) of . Waltham , president of the Senate . In its unanimous report the commission asserted : " The basic question is whether the growth of our economic resources justify mounting state expenditures , including distribution of state-collected taxes to local governments . These totaled over $160,000,000 in 1945 ; nearly $327 , - 000,000 in 1947 ( the year of the veterans ' bonus ) ; and $361,000,000 in 1950 . We have found that while the relative capacity of the private economy of our government is high , it is less than that of a dozen other states and has not shown the same degree of growth as several states comparable to Massachusetts . " Plateau Reached However , the commission did temper its adverse views with the assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts is one , have reached a plateau of economic development that can not be expected to show the steep rises of the more newly established areas . While government expenditure programs should consider this condition , the opportunities that exist for industrial expansion indicate that stability and growth for the immediate years ahead can result from sound public policy . " Massachusetts ' relative position in comparison to the nation as a whole declined over the past 50 years , the commission said . The commission pointed out that Massachusetts started the century with 13.6 per cent of the nation 's business establishments ; 19.9 per cent of the production workers ; 19.6 per cent of the wages paid to production workers , and 17.6 per cent of the value added by manufacture . Decrease Shown But in 1947 , according to the most recent census of manufacturers , Massachusetts had dropped to 11.7 per cent of the business establishments ; 14.5 per cent of the production workers ; 13.5 per cent of the wages paid , and 12.9 per cent of the value added by manufacture . The commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of the older industrial states in either number of firms , number employed , wages paid , or value added by manufacture . As tax bases , manufacturing and related factors in Massachusetts have not only failed to maintain the rate of growth established for the country as a whole , but have fallen behind the combined rate of growth for the five states of Connecticut , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , and Massachusetts . The causes for this decline must be found in economic studies . The effects upon comparative tax resources of the state are plain . " Soaring U.S. Tax Turning to the weight of federal , state , and local taxes Massachusetts ' residents , the commission said approximately 24 cents out of each dollar went for taxes . It pointed out , however , that the relative significance of state and local taxes has been dwarfed by the great increase in federal income taxes in the last few years . It pointed out that in 1936 Massachusetts ' residents had a total income of $3,000,000,000 , and that taxes amounted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the federal government , and 9.9 per cent to the state . On the other hand , in 1949 individual income of Massachusetts residents soared to $6,382,000,000 . Of this amount , the federal government collected 15.1 per cent in income taxes , while the state and local share was 8.9 per cent , and even smaller percentage than was obtained by the state in 1936 . The commission in another part of its report said : " The relative standing of Massachusetts among the other states in per capita income payments to individuals has declined in the past 20 years . The commonwealth ranked seventh among the states in 1929 . It dropped to 13th in 1949 . This is no longer a matter of relative growth and is therefore a trend of present and future sig.nificance . To the extent that per capita payments to individuals measure the comparative tax resources of states , this conclusion is warranted : " Massachusetts falls below a dozen other states in its relative capacity to meet the needs of government , below such competing states as Ohio , New Jersey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Indiana and Pennsylvania .
