Wyoming started it all , back in 1939 . By last week , with Idaho and Tennessee lately joining the parade , 32 state legislatures had followed Wyoming in an extraordinary appeal : Congress should set about amending the Constitution to limit the federal income-tax bite . Many of the " memorials " propose a specific federal ceiling : 25% of an individual 's taxable income . Existing constitutional ceiling : none . Maximum under present law : 87% . <P> The 33 total is highly cheering to advocates of income-tax limitation , because the Constitution says , in Article V , that Congress " shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments " upon request of two-thirds , or 32 , of the state legislatures . Nonetheless , for the foreseeable future , the prospects for a tax-ceiling amendment are nil ( even aside from the fact that at least seven of the 33 legislatures later canceled their memorials ) . Most members of Congress are well aware that , while it might make economic sense , drastic income-tax limitation would 1 ) annoy a lot of voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) cost the Federal Government an indispensable slice of its income . Illinois ' Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen , a McKinley Republican , has dropped a tax-limitation bill into the Senate hopper , but the proposal is sleeping soundly , and only a loud popular demand-wildly improbable-would awaken it .
