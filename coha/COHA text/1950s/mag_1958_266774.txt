To spur business , the Federal Reserve Board last week brought out the most potent anti-slump tonic in its bag of economic medicines . It cut by % the minimum cash reserves that must be kept by the Fed 's 6,400 member banks to back demand deposits ; minimum reserves were dropped to 19% of deposits in New York and Chicago . 17% in most other big cities and 11% in " country " bank areas . This freed $500 million from reserves , and since each such dollar can generate up to $6 in loans , it could add close to $3 billion to the credit supply . The move should give business a bigger lift than the Fed 's two recent cuts in the discount rate , which actually created no new credit . <P> FRB acted after a survey showed that " a good many individual banks " could not satisfy all loan demands . Said FRB Chairman William McChesney Martin Jr. : " We want to get down to the point where no banks are holding back . " <P> Bankers have long clamored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as the logical follow-through to the discount-rate reductions . But last week they grumbled that the cut was not big enough . Said President George Champion of the Chase Manhattan Bank , second biggest in the U.S. : " This is only a token adjustment and not as much as will be needed . The time is ripe to loosen up much more on reserve requirements . " <P> Yet the Fed chose to tread cautiously , " lest it relax credit too much . The cut in reserves puts the banks in about the same position as they were at the bottom of the 1953-54 recession when FRB also cut reserves to ease credit . The result was a sharp pickup in business . If last week 's cut does not spur business , FRB was in a mood to cut some more . But despite spreading unemployment it still planned to move slowly . Warned Martin : " We must recognize that excessive stimulus during a recession can sow seeds of inflation that can jeopardize our long-run stability . " <P> FRB 's policy of easing money seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks lopped % off time-deposit rates , dropped them to 2% or 2% . As interest rates edged down , demand for credit picked up . Loans by New York City banks rose $152 million last week , more than twice the gain of the same 1957 week .
