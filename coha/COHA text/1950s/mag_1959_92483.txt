The horse to your right is known as The Diller , although actually he is registered as Diller Hanover . The horsemen say he is a killer , this Diller , and that next Wednesday afternoon on the fast mile track at Du Quoin , Illinois , he will trot off with the 34th Hambletonian , leaving behind him a struggling line of 3-year-olds . Then real fame , they say , will come to The Diller along with the almighty dollar . And so , perhaps , it shall be . // Two years ago he was standing in the sales ring at Harrisburg , Pa. , just another bay colt with good breeding His father was Star 's Pride , who as a 5-year-old had trotted to a 1:571/5 mile over the same Du Quoin track . His mother was a mare named Dream Hanover , who at the age of 21 had died a disappointment . She had 12 foals in her lifetime , and The Diller was her last . // As Diller came to the ring he caught the eyes of Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . Mrs. Hall bought him for $6,300 , and last year he became the third leading money-winning 2-year-old trotter ever , with earnings of $87,332 . The Halls were not , however , primarily interested in money . Like many elderly people they had a very special dream : a dream that they would have a starter in a Hambletonian. // In October last year The Diller 's 43-year-old trainer and driver , Ralph Baldwin , decided to unwind him and plan for the 1959 Hambletonian . The Halls agreed . Baldwin took The Diller to Orlando this past winter , rested him and this spring , slowly , meticulously , started to wind him up again . He was jogged in early spring but kept from the races , and Baldwin watched over and cared for him as if he were a precious , bright orchid . // On June 30 , with but a bit over two months left to prepare for the Hambletonian , Baldwin brought The Diller back to the races . He won four straight dashes at Saratoga Raceway , beating older horses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other two . He was shipped to Yonkers for the $56,397 Yonkers Futurity , and , after being parked on the outside for the entire mile , lost by half a length to John A. Hanover . The Diller moved on to Sportsman 's Park in Chicago and was beaten again , this time by the 4-year-old Hardy Royal . Baldwin was not discouraged . The Diller came back a week later and , after spotting his field 10 lengths , sailed through the stretch to win by a nose . // PASSES IN REVIEW // Then this past Thursday , he convinced knowledgeable horsemen that not for many years has a Hambletonian candidate stood out over his opponents as The Diller does . In the two-heat $18,642 Review Futurity he went on a mile track for the first time this year . He took on 14 other starters , 11 of them Hambletonian candidates , including John A. Hanover . After being shuffled back to sixth at the half-mile in the first heat , he looped his field and coasted to the wire a two-length winner in 2:01 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pack but brushed past horses to win by three lengths in 2:01 . Twice he demonstrated that the early speed of John A. Hanover was not as serviceable on a mile track as it had been on the tight turns of Yonkers ' half-miler . Twice he demonstrated that he was just reaching his mountain while his opponents , who had raced hard and often in the spring , seemed to be moving back down into the valleys . // This year 's Hambletonian will probably be the richest in history , and if a field of 20 go as expected it will be the richest harness race of all time , with a gross purse of $133,000 . ( The Hambletonian , however , has always been a money race . The first one , held at Syracuse in 1926 , grossed $73,451 ; the Kentucky Derby that same year was worth only $60,075 . ) Aside from the money , however , the thing that makes the Hambletonian important is its attendant prestige . Nearly every important person connected with owning , breeding , training or driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five major 3-year-old trotting events , none has a roll of winners like the Hambletonian : Greyhound , Bill Gallon , Hoot Mon , Demon Hanover , Hickory Smoke , Scott Frost . The Hambletonian has led a transitory life , to say the least . For the first four years it was shuttled between Syracuse and Lexington . Then for 26 years it settled in the bucolic community of Goshen , and once , during World War II , was held at Empire City . For the last two years it has been held at Du Quoin ( see page 18 ) . // So far as Ralph Baldwin and The Diller are concerned , there are really only two problems . The first is the draw for post position , but if Diller gets close to the pole he should have little trouble . The second would be an injury , but with the care that Baldwin has exerted for the past few weeks this seems unlikely . // John A. Hanover , quite naturally , will try to get to the front and steal the race . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trick . Billy Haughton , who has yet to decide between Circo and Hickory Pride , will probably drive Circo because of his two seconds behind The Diller last Thursday in The Review . Rodney Pick , the " house horse " of Don and Gene Hayes , who run the Du Quoin Fair , will be the favorite son of Illinois , but he does n't seem capable of taking Diller or Circo. // The rest of the field will probably consist of Lord Chutney , Newport Dillon , Spike Hanover ( a full brother to the 1948 winner , Demon Hanover ) , Tartan Hanover , The Lodger , The Prince and Flight Song . Other possible starters are Tie Silk , Anvil Chorus , Rose Queen , Lady Belvedere and Solid Choice . Both Rose Queen and Lady Belvedere are fillies . Lady Belvedere gave Driver Del Miller encouragement when she won a mile race at Springfield last week in 2:03 3/5. // But any horse that beats The Diller next Wednesday will be a pretty tired horse , and an awfully good one as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
