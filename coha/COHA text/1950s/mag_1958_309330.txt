The biggest part of the job of any Congressman before , during and after a campaign is talking with constituents about what they have on their minds . Last week TIME listened while Michigan 's Chuck Chamberlain talked with voters who streamed through his trailer . <P> <P> FARMER JACK MAIN : Tell me why , when your first load of beans goes in to market , the price drops . <P> CHAMBERLAIN : It 's a supply and demand situation , do n't you think ? <P> MAIN : I do n't know . I ca n't figure it . <P> CHAMBERLAIN : Do you think the less control over the farmer the better , or how would you say it ? <P> MAIN : I 'd say it like that . Farmers are better off without controls . Of course the soil bank is damn silly . I know a lot of farmers who are sitting around making money by not raising anything . Now that 's damn silly , would n't you say ? <P> CHAMBERLAIN ( to a Fisher Body worker ) : Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? <P> WORKER : You do n't get nothing by raises . Twenty years ago at Chevy I made $1.04 an hour . I could save money then . Now , at $2.50 an hour , I ca n't save anything . So what 's Reuther done for me ? A lot of headaches , that 's all . <P> A BLONDE IN BLUE JEANS : I 've got husband trouble . <P> CHAMBERLAIN : Tell me about it . <P> THE BLONDE : I 've got a $30 Government check for my husband and he 's been gone since Sept. 3 . Can I sign his name to the check and cash it ? <P> CHAMBERLAIN : I would n't advise you to do that . You would only be borrowing more trouble . - <P> FARMER KERMIT CAREY : I wish you 'd get out to the farmers more . I 'm for you , you know , but lots of farmers have n't met you . You should come out on one of these soil conservation tours - lots of farmers you should meet . <P> CHAMBERLAIN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those soil conservation tours . Do n't misunderstand me , Kermit . I 've got to do more in Livingston County . I want to do more there . But I 've just got to put in my time where it 's needed most . <P> BUICK PLANT WORKER : I 'd like to know why these investigating committees do n't go ahead and do something about what they 've found out . They 're giving us all a bad name , but it is n't us guys in the shop who are doing the racketeering . It 's the guys on top . Why do n't you do something about that ? <P> CHAMBERLAIN : I 'm glad you asked that . I do n't think there 's anything wrong with union members-but they 've been exploited by their leaders . Now I voted against the Kennedy-Ives labor bill because I think we 'll get a better bill next session . You know , it 's about a dozen years since Taft-Hartley , and if we had taken this bill , which was n't very good , people would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and maybe it would take another dozen years before we got a good piece of legislation . - <P> PENSIONER BRIAN SKELLENGER ( his wife had been laid off from the General Motors AC Spark Plug Division plant in 1952 as permanently disabled , but had so far been unable to collect Social Security disability benefits ) : I told Social Security that I was going to see my Congressman , and they told me not to do that . They said it would simply delay matters . Is that right ?
