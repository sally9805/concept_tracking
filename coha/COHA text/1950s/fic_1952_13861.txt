The place is Crookshank 's Food and Drink , adjoining a parking lot . ARCHIE CROOKSHANK himself , a man of sixty or so who came over from London twenty years ago , is studying some papers , as he straightens a chair at a table . A young WOMAN comes in . ARCHIE What is it now ? What do you want in here ? ROSE What do I want , Archie ? That 's a nice question to ask a customer . I want a drink , that 's what I want . ARCHIE You do , do you ? Well , read the sign . ( He points . ) ROSE ( Reading . ) Court of Justice . What 's that mean ? ARCHIE What 's it mean ? It means you ca n't have a drink , that 's what it means . Not in here , at any rate . ROSE Oh , do n't be silly , Archie . Get behind the bar now , and pour me a shot of whiskey like you 've done almost a whole year now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . I 'll ask you to get out of here , that 's what I 'll do . ROSE ( Astonished . ) Well , if you 've fallen to common rudeness , if you 've turned out like everybody else in the world and made yourself and your place that I 've taken all along , one for a friend and the other for a friend 's place , the same as others and their places , then I will go , Archie , and say to myself , Well , there 's another of them turned out like all the others . p. 3 ARCHIE Will you stop your jabbering , please ? Now , is n't the sign over the door outside , too ? Then why do you come in here ? The place is a Court of Justice now . ROSE I saw the sign . I thought somebody had put it up to make you mad or give you a laugh . It 's not a very large sign and your own sign 's still there , too , and much larger , Crookshank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place is a Court of Justice . ROSE Since when ? ARCHIE Since three o'clock this morning when they got me up out of bed , right upstairs there , and told me so . They gave me these printed instructions , they gave me spoken instructions , they gave me hinted instructions , and they gave me every other kind , too . ROSE Who was it did it , Archie ? ARCHIE Who was it did it ? ( Points at sign . ) Step over there and read for yourself who was it did it . They 'll be here in a minute . I 've set the clock , just as I was instructed to do . Court opens at ten . It 's a quarter to now , so you 'd better get out . ROSE Let me stay , Archie . Let me watch . I 've never seen them do . I hear the lawyers are n't lawyers , the judges are n't judges , and nobody knows anything about anything , but they all go to work just the same , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlucky enough to fall into their hands . p. 4 ARCHIE You 'll be the unlucky one when you fall into their hands . ROSE Why would I fall into their hands ? I 'm no enemy of the Republic . ARCHIE Is that so ? Well , just run down the list of people they call enemies . Here . Run down for yourself . ( He shows her the list , running his finger down the page , stopping suddenly . ) Read that for yourself . ROSE I do n't like the language they use . I think they might have chosen a more courteous way of putting it . They ca n't prove a thing , anyway . Let me stay and watch . ARCHIE This is no sideshow , girl . ROSE We 've been friends for so long , Archie . If I ca n't have a drink , at least let me stay and watch . I swear to God I am lonely . I 've nowhere else to go and I had counted on coming here for a rest . ARCHIE The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out before you fall into their hands . ROSE You do have love in your heart , Archie . If it were n't that you were thinking of me , I know you 'd let me stay , and I appreciate it . I appreciate it very much . ARCHIE If you appreciate it , get going , will you ? p. 5 ROSE Yes , Archie . ( She turns to go . ) Well , goodbye . I 'm going to miss the place , Archie . ARCHIE Miss the place ? What for ? ( He fumbles through the papers . ) It 's just for today . I do n't remember reading anything that said it was for more than one day . ROSE Did you read anything that said it was for today only ? ARCHIE No . ROSE Then it 's for as long as they like . Maybe for ever . ARCHIE No , they ca n't do that . I 've got customers . I 've built up a nice little business . Of course it 's just for today . ROSE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go on . Do n't try to upset me the first thing in the morning . ROSE Me , Archie ? Try to upset you ? How can you say such a thing ? There 's no use trying to hide from the truth , though . You 've fallen into their hands . ARCHIE The hell I have . ROSE Then why have they come here instead of some place that would be more suitable for a Court of Justice ? ARCHIE The parking lot next door , that 's why . They said so themselves . The high brick walls of the warehouse surrounding the parking lot , that 's why they 've come here . p. 6 ROSE What 's the parking lot and the high brick walls got to do with anything ? ARCHIE Well , they were out there with red flares this morning , talking about it . The Judge is going to stand back there where I stand . The lawyers are going to sit at these eating tables , and walk back and forth in front of the bar . The prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . ROSE What about the parking lot next door ? ARCHIE I do n't know . I guess that 's where they 'll keep the prisoners . Whatever it 's for , you 'd better get out . ROSE I 'm scared , Archie . There 's so many people killing themselves these days . Shooting themselves , or swallowing pills , or jumping out of buildings , or driving their cars into other cars or over cliffs , and so many killing their kids , too , and their husbands and wives and mothers and fathers . Every time you look at a paper you read about half a dozen more of them , people you do n't know , but you know they 're wives and mothers or husbands and fathers . I 'm scared of it , Archie . ARCHIE All right now , take it easy . ROSE I get awful lonesome in the streets , Archie . I keep looking for a place to rest , and this is the only place I 've ever found . My room is n't like this place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they kill themselves because the minute I 'm alone in my room I swear to God , Archie , I keep thinking I 've got to do it , too . I 've got to , there 's nothing else to do , nothing else to do any more , it 's too late now , it 's no use now . And then I remember this place and I say to myself , Archie 'll be open in five or six hours . Try it once more . You never know . Tomorrow may be the good day . Something may turn up tomorrow . Somebody may turn up . I do n't like what 's happening , Archie . The minute I stepped in here this morning you hollered at me . You never did that before . p. 7 ARCHIE They never made a Court of Justice out of my place before , either . You better go . ROSE I 'm scared , Archie . Do n't you understand ? I 'm afraid if I go I 'll go forever . And I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other places nicer than this if it comes to furniture . There 's churches to go to , but they 're not for me . There 's the places where people are busy selling or buying , but they 're not for me , either . There 's the cheerful parks with the cheerful flowers and birds  --  I guess they 're cheerful  --  but they 're not for me . There 's the libraries to sit in and read , but nothing I ever found to read was for me . This is the only place I ever found that was for me . For me , too , Archie . It was n't home , but it was something like it . I could come in here and rest anyway . I could pretend here , Archie . The whiskey could help me believe I still had something to wait for , something worth waiting for . I 've had whiskey in a lot of other places but it did n't mean anything like what it means to me here . ( Desperately . ) Archie ! ARCHIE Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happening to all of us . Something terrible 's happening to all of us and I 'm scared to death of it . I wish to God I was n't so weak , so I could work as a waitress or something , but I 'm weak , Archie . I get tired . My back hurts , my legs hurt , my arms hurt , my head aches . In a half hour I 'm ready to faint . I do n't know why . I 'm just weak , I guess . Weak and scared . I do n't want to go . I 'm afraid to go , Archie. p. 8 ARCHIE There 's nothing to be afraid of . They 'll only be here today , and then tomorrow you can come back and everything 'll be all right again . ROSE They 'll stay , Archie . Once they 're here , they 'll stay . If they 're down to saloons now  --  if they 've used up all the schools and churches and museums for Courts of Justice and they 're down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not let anybody hear you talk that way . ROSE I know , Archie . I know what to say when I 'm talking to anybody but you , anybody else in the whole world , but now I 'm talking to you , and I say they 'll stay . ARCHIE For God 's sake , girl , there 's somebody at the door . Now , hurry  --  get out . ROSE Goodbye , Archie . Good luck . ( TWO GUARDS carrying rifles with bayonets attached to them come in , followed by a very tall and thin MAN of sixty or so who wears the same uniform as the guards , but with many decorations . He notices the girl . ) GOVERNMENT MAN Your daughter , I presume , Mr. Crookshank . Well , there 's work for her to do , too . ARCHIE Just a minute , General . GOVERNMENT MAN If you please , Mr. Crookshank , I will need the services of your daughter . Your name , Miss ? p. 9 ROSE Rose . GOVERNMENT MAN Rose Crookshank . Your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I help my father . GOVERNMENT MAN Very good . Now , Miss Crookshank , you will stand there please and serve as witness on behalf of the people . We have dispensed with the time-wasting jury system , but whenever possible or convenient we install a witness on behalf of the people . Raise your right arm please . ( She does so . ) Say the following words . I , Rose Crookshank , swear that I have lived faithfully not for myself but for all of the people . ROSE ( Mumbling swiftly . ) I , Rose Crookshank , swear that I have lived faithfully not for myself but for all of the people . GOVERNMENT MAN Very good . ( To ARCHIE . ) I see all is in order , Mr. Crookshank . ARCHIE I was wondering  --  GOVERNMENT MAN Yes ? ARCHIE Well , I was wondering how long I might have the honor  --  GOVERNMENT MAN How long ? Why , until justice has been done , of course . ARCHIE ( Dazed . ) Yes , sir . p. 10 GOVERNMENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the first Accused . ( The GUARDS go out . The GOVERNMENT MAN goes to the bar . The OTHERS come in , including a YOUNG MAN who is the ACCUSED . To the YOUNG MAN . ) You will stand here . ACCUSED Yes , sir . ( He goes behind the bar . ) GOVERNMENT MAN The procedure will be the usual one . The Accused are outside waiting , are they not ? ACCUSED Yes , sir . GOVERNMENT MAN ( To one MAN . ) That is the desk for the Attorney for the People . ( To ANOTHER . ) That is the desk for the Attorney for the Accused . ( They go to their desks . ) That is the desk for the Bailiff . The People 's Attorney will inform the Court what the nature of the crime is . The Attorney for the Accused will answer on behalf of the Accused . The Bailiff will await the Court 's decision , stamp the Accused 's papers , and the Accused will be removed through that door to the parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAILIFF Yes , sir . GOVERNMENT MAN They will do their work immediately in each case . Now , the Accused will stand there . ( He has said this to a MAN who apparently has seemed to him to be the one who looks the most guilty of something or other. ) p. 11 JUDGE ( Pointing to the MAN behind the bar . ) He is the Accused , sir . GOVERNMENT MAN Who are you ? JUDGE I am the Judge , sir . GOVERNMENT MAN Very well . ( To the ACCUSED . ) Please stand there . ( To the JUDGE . ) Please stand behind the bar . ( To EVERYBODY . ) Mr. Crookshank and his daughter Rose will remain in Court , the father to serve the Court , the daughter to witness on behalf of the people . I think that is all . ( To JUDGE . ) Begin , then . JUDGE First Accused , please . PEOPLE 'S ATTORNEY ( Lifting several sheets of paper from a stack of papers . ) Edward Ellington .

JUDGE Attorney for the Accused . ACCUSED 'S ATTORNEY Yes , sir . JUDGE Proceed , please . ACCUSED 'S ATTORNEY Inform the Court in your own words what happened . ACCUSED Well , I 'd go out and get a job and somebody from the Office of Employment would come and get me fired . They said I had to get a job through the Office of Employment . I went there every morning at seven and stayed until seven at night for three months but the clerk never gave me a job . One day I asked him when I 'd get a job . He said never , as far as he was concerned . I said why . He said I had already taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who had not taken illegal jobs . I asked him how I was going to live . You do n't have to live , he said . This made me mad because I was trying my best to abide by the rules , so I said , Neither do you . I took him by the shoulders and dragged him across the counter . JUDGE Go on . ACCUSED He screamed and kicked . We stumbled and fell . The Guards came . One of them hit him on top of the head with a stick . They picked him up and went off with him . I went to my room . I had what was left of a loaf of bread for supper , then went to sleep . In the middle of the night  --  last night  --  some Guards came and took me away . p. 13 JUDGE People 's Attorney , are you satisfied the Accused is guilty ? PEOPLE 'S ATTORNEY I am . JUDGE Attorney for the Accused , are you ? ACCUSED 'S ATTORNEY The Accused , may it please the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Employment . PEOPLE 'S ATTORNEY He himself has confessed that he grabbed the Clerk by the shoulders . Is n't that so ? ACCUSED 'S ATTORNEY He was angry . I question if he actually meant to assassinate the Clerk . JUDGE Attorney for the Accused , you will please leave the passing of judgment to the Court . ACCUSED 'S ATTORNEY Yes , sir . JUDGE ( To the ACCUSED . ) Is there anything you wish to say ? ACCUSED I only wanted to do the right thing . I only wanted to abide by the rules . I only wanted to get a legal job , so I would n't lose it , because I want to get married and have a family . JUDGE Anything else ? ACCUSED I 've never looked for trouble . JUDGE He said to you , You do n't have to live , and you said to him , Neither do you . And then you attacked him . ( Pause . ) Answer the Court , please . And then you attacked him . Is that right ? p. 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Slight pause . ) Guards . GOVERNMENT MAN One moment . All Accused are permitted to make a last request . ( To the ACCUSED . ) The usual is a cigarette . Here , because of the setting , a drink is permissible . Inform the Court of your last request . ACCUSED I 'd like a good meal . GOVERNMENT MAN That would take too long . A drink or a cigarette ? ACCUSED Well , I 'd like a drink first and a cigarette afterwards , then . GOVERNMENT MAN I think that is permissible . Mr. Crookshank will manage these matters . ARCHIE ( Goes to end of bar . ) What 'll you have , son ? ACCUSED Brandy . GOVERNMENT MAN You will keep an account of the drinks , Mr. Crookshank , on Form 333 , for remuneration by the Government . ARCHIE ( Pours drink , hands it to ACCUSED , who gulps it down . ) Another ? GOVERNMENT MAN The Government will pay for only one drink per Accused , Mr. Crookshank .

ACCUSED Any kind just now , Mr. Crookshank . Thanks . ( He takes a cigarette from ARCHIE 'S pack . ARCHIE lights it . ) GOVERNMENT MAN Very good . Proceed , Guards . ( The GUARDS go off with the ACCUSED . ) The Court will occupy itself with routine work until each Accused is corrected . At that time another Accused will be brought in for judgment . Is that understood ? EVERYBODY Yes , sir . POWERFUL VOICE ( Off . ) Guards of the Republic , for the people ! CHORUS OF VOICES ( Off . ) For the people ! ( A VOLLEY OF SHOTS is heard . ) GOVERNMENT MAN Proceed , then . JUDGE The next Accused , please . ( The GUARDS bring in a VERY OLD MAN . ) GOVERNMENT MAN Very good .

JUDGE Guards , the next Accused , please ! ( The GUARDS go out quickly . ) A great deal can be done in two minutes , Mr. Crookshank , as you will see . The value of two minutes to the Government is  --  ( The GUARDS come in with an angry YOUNG MAN who glares with contempt at the JUDGE , the LAWYERS , the BAILIFF and EVERYBODY ELSE . ) Let 's make it snappy , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age .

ROSE runs to the door leading to the parking lot while ARCHIE stands at the center of his place of business , in a daze . ) ROSE What are we going to do , Archie ? ARCHIE Do ? What are we going to do ? From now until one o'clock in the morning I 'm going to run my business  --  that 's what I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place again . ROSE Why would n't they come into the place again ? ARCHIE They 'd be scared to death , would n't they , excepting maybe one or two who did n't know or did n't care ? ROSE Or one or two who 'd be sent to spy , Archie ? They 'd send one or two to spy , would n't they ? You have fallen into their hands , have n't you ? Well , if you have , then so have I. I 've never been so proud , though , Archie . I thought you 'd tell him I was n't your daughter . p. 20 ARCHIE I could n't do that . How should I know what he might do ? He might put you out there with the others , the poor souls . ROSE They were none of them guilty of anything . If they can kill them , Archie , God knows they 'll get around to me soon enough , but while I 'm waiting , I 'm ever so proud to be your daughter  --  and ever so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ARCHIE You 'd better have your whiskey now . ROSE Yes , thanks , Archie . Yes , I need some whiskey all right . ( He pours for her , and for himself . She reaches out to touch glasses . ) I do n't know what to say , Archie . God help us , I guess . God have mercy on us , I guess . God forgive us , I guess . Jesus , Archie , I 've got the shakes and I want to cry . Can I cry ? Can I drink this down and cry someplace ? I 'm afraid to go to my room and cry , and I would n't cry in a place of business . ARCHIE Drink your whiskey , girl . Drink your whiskey and I 'll fill your glass again . ( He gulps down his drink . She drinks hers . He fills her glass again . ) Cry anywhere you like . ( He pours himself another shot quickly and downs it . ROSE takes her glass and goes to a table and sits down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I might as well get up and go , and leave it to them altogether . p. 21 ROSE Leave , Archie ? You ca n't be thinking of running away . It would be the same anywhere you went . ARCHIE There must be somewhere to go . ROSE It 's the same everywhere . This is your place . You ca n't run away from it . All you can do is keep it going from five in the afternoon to one in the morning . ARCHIE I ca n't do anybody any good here any more . ROSE You ca n't do them any harm here , either , and you ca n't do them any good at all anywhere else . ARCHIE Will you please stop talking as if you were my daughter ? ROSE Well , you do n't have to shout at me , do you ? ( She gets up and goes to the door to the kitchen . ) ARCHIE Well , now , sit down a minute and let 's see if we can talk sense . ROSE There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . You 'd better fill out the form for the drinks . ARCHIE I do n't want any money for the drinks . ROSE They wo n't like that , Archie . You 'd better fill out the form , and the one for the food , too . You 've got to keep the place going the same as ever if you do n't want them to take you for an enemy . p. 22 ARCHIE They know I 'm an enemy . They know everybody is . ROSE Well , then they 'll expect you to pretend you 're not , and you 'd better do it . I 'll straighten out the kitchen . You fill out the forms . You 'll need the money to keep supplies in the kitchen , and bottles on your shelves . ( She goes . ) ARCHIE ( Examining forms . ) Happy birthday ? Get born ? ( Shouting . ) Rose ! ROSE ( Appears in doorway . ) What is it , Archie ? ARCHIE What did he mean ? Get born ? ROSE Well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . The kitchen 's a mess . I 'm tired just noticing what a mess it is , but for once in my life I 'm going to do my work just the same . ( Pause . ) Archie ? ARCHIE Yes , Rose ? ROSE You 're not sorry you told him I 'm your daughter , are you ? ARCHIE I had to tell him that , did n't I ? ROSE But you 're not sorry , are you ? ARCHIE Well , no , Rose . Why should I be sorry ? p. 23 ROSE I mean , you 're not ashamed , are you ? ARCHIE Look here , now . A lot of things have happened today that have all but destroyed my soul and made me ashamed of my whole life  --  for the stupid way I 've gone along with it . If they were guilty  --  any of them  --  I 'm guiltier . But I wo n't be ashamed . I wo n't be ashamed of any human being who tries not to hurt another human being . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daughter . ROSE Thanks , Archie . I 've never had a father , you know . Christ , he was gone before I even smelled him . ARCHIE And I 've never been a father , either . Yes , I have children somewhere in the world . For hating their mother so , I left them  --  twenty years ago . ROSE I did n't know , Archie . I 'm awful sorry . ARCHIE God knows what 's become of the poor woman , or the boy , or the two girls . ROSE Oh , I 'm sorry , Archie . I 'm so sorry for your poor babies  --  fatherless . ARCHIE The boy was six , the first girl was four , the baby two . I 'd all but forgotten them until today . I 've never been a father . ROSE I 'll be a good daughter , Archie . I 'll never again be tired the way I 've been all my life . ( She goes into the kitchen. ) p. 24 ARCHIE If they 'd had homes , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ended the way they did , killed for nothing . ROSE ( At the door . ) Now , what is it you 're saying , Archie ? I 've got work to do but I ca n't do it with you saying something I ca n't hear . I 've got to hear everything you say . What is it , Archie ? ARCHIE I 'm saying they 'd not have been murdered if they 'd had mothers and fathers who had been mothers and father , if they 'd not been orphans from the beginning , that 's what I 'm saying . ROSE Why , that 's silly , Archie . Just think what you 're really saying . You 're saying it 's better to be a murderer than to be murdered , and you know that 's not so at all . One 's as bad as the other , and everybody 's as much an orphan as anybody else . So if that 's what 's the matter with us , it 's the matter with all of us , and not just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all had the same father and mother  --  a man and a woman each , some luckier than others in the names of the men and women , or the place of them in society , or the wealth of them , or something else accidental . It 's all of us , Archie , and not one side on this side , and another on the other . What about the man who said I was your daughter ? He set the Court up , did n't he , and started the killing ? But who is he , Archie . Who is he himself ? p. 25 ARCHIE Who is he ? I 'll tell you who he is . He 's a son of a bitch , that 's who he is . ROSE Is n't he a man , too , like everybody else , and not altogether unkind or inhuman , although he knows the Court he has set up must find everybody guilty ? Who is he , anyway ? ARCHIE Now , why do you try to confuse me ? ROSE Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do that would change him from a son of a bitch to something better ? ARCHIE What could he do ? He could  --  Well , he could  --  ROSE Is n't he carrying out orders ? ARCHIE I wo n't have you speaking up for the murderers as though they were every one of them helpless and sorry . ROSE But if it 's the truth , Archie ? If they are all of them helpless , and maybe sorry , too , are we to pretend something else ? ARCHIE Somebody has got to accept responsibility for the murders . They ca n't just say they 're helpless and sorry and keep killing everybody . Somebody 's got to refuse to carry out orders . ROSE Archie ? ARCHIE Now , do n't make me angry , Rose . Do n't annoy me . I 'm annoyed enough as it is . ( He takes a drink straight from the bottle . ) What is it ? p. 26 ROSE You yourself are carrying out orders . I do n't want to annoy you , but is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different with me . I have this little restaurant and saloon . I 'm not a politician . I 'm not in the Government . They 're the ones who 've got to refuse to carry out orders . ROSE By doing that they 'd only condemn themselves to death , would n't they , Archie ? ARCHIE They can get the hell out of the Government , ca n't they ? ROSE Do you think so , Archie ? Do you think it 's as easy as all that ? ARCHIE Nothing 's easy . Why should it be easy ? ROSE Why ? Because everybody wants everything to be easy , I guess . ARCHIE One of them 's got to have the courage to refuse to carry out orders and pay for it with his life . ROSE Why should it be one of them any more than it should be one of us , Archie ? ARCHIE You 're annoying me , Rose . You 're making me feel guilty for every murder that took place here today . If I had spoken up I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archie , you would have . ARCHIE Well , then , do n't annoy me about it . Do n't be forever nagging at me for not getting myself killed the first day they turn my place into a slaughter house . Do n't tell me I 'm to pity the murderers and the murdered alike , and myself , and yourself . Life 's not worth living if you 've got to pity everybody . It does n't make sense pitying everybody . You 've got to love some and hate others . p. 27 ROSE It 's easy to love and hate , Archie . Just as easy as it is to breathe , but what does it mean ? Does it mean something ? I love you , I hate you , you love me , you hate me , we love the murdered ones , we hate the ones who murdered them , what does it mean ? And who was it murdered them ? Was it the Lawyers , the Judge , the Bailiff with the rubber stamp , the Guards in here , the Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republic , for the people , and the Guards shouting back For the people , and then killing one of the people . For which people is it ? Is there two people ? There 's only one people . It 's easy to love and hate , Archie . And by now I 'm sick and tired of it . ARCHIE Well , now , I 've taken you in , I 've told them you 're my daughter , but it 's no good your annoying me with the hopelessness of my position . ROSE Not yours alone , Archie . Mine , too . And anybody 's Everybody 's . If it is hopeless , it 's hopeless for all of us , but is it hopeless ? Is there no answer ? ARCHIE Answer them ? We 'd be shot . ROSE Not them  --  ourselves , Archie . Have we no answer for ourselves ? ARCHIE Are you telling me to get myself killed the first thing tomorrow morning ? Are you telling me to speak up for the Accused , to defy the Accusers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself killed ? Is that it ? p. 28 ROSE I do n't know , Archie . I do n't mean for you , I mean for me , too . I do n't know what I 'm telling you , or myself . ARCHIE Well , for somebody who does n't know , you 're annoying me enough , I 'll say that . I 've lived sixty-two years , and that 's long enough at that . Now , I will ask you to help me . Help me find out what my duty is , and I swear to God I 'll do it . Is it to kill the Judge , standing here where I now stand ? ROSE I 'm sure it could n't be that . ARCHIE Is it to plead with them to let myself be shot in place of another  --  in place of  --  well , one of the younger men , in place of somebody like that last one today ? Is that it , Rose ? ROSE Would n't they shoot him , too , after they 'd shot you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm asking you . ROSE If you pleaded with them to let you take the place of another , they would not let you take his place , but they would put you down as an enemy of the Republic , and the next day you would be tried and executed , too . ARCHIE Then , would it be to poison their food at lunchtime ? The Judge , the Bailiff , the Lawyers , the Guards , the Firing Squads , and all the others ? Would it be that ? p. 29 ROSE Oh , they 'd die all right , Archie , but that would n't stop the trials and the executions . It would only make us accuse and kill more of us . ARCHIE Them , you mean , do n't you ? It would only make them accuse and kill more of us . Is that what you mean ? ROSE No , we 're all together . We accuse and kill , and we are accused , and we are killed . ARCHIE Ah , for God 's sake , girl , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ROSE I might , Archie . I might . ARCHIE No , you would n't . They accuse and they kill . We just wait , hoping not to be accused , so we can die of old age . It 's the end for all of us now , that 's all . ROSE I guess it is , Archie . ARCHIE Now , how did it happen ? And what are we to do ? That 's the question . We just ca n't stand by with our mouths open , can we ? ROSE We 've got to sing or something . ARCHIE Sing ? What good would that do ? ROSE We might just begin to understand that we do n't have to kill ourselves . ARCHIE Ah , there 'll never be another soul come in here to keep my poor business going , that 's all I know . I give drinks to the dead now , and food to the killers . My customers are the dead , and the whole business is on credit . p. 30 ROSE ( At the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor man , lying dead and alone ! They 'll take him away in the morning .

ARCHIE ( At the door . ) What is it , girl ? ROSE For God 's sake , Archie , come and look ! Is he getting up or is it my imagination ? Look , there , Archie ! ARCHIE God Almighty , have mercy on us , he 's on his hands and knees . ( Shouts . ) Do n't do it ! Lie down , man ! ROSE Let me go help him ! ARCHIE ( Grabs her . ) Are you mad , girl ? ROSE Let me go , Archie ! He 's not dead ! He needs help ! ARCHIE We ca n't help him ! Get inside here , let me bolt the door , he 'll fall back again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( She breaks free , but he grabs her again . ) ARCHIE Now , will you come to your senses ? ROSE I 've got to help him , Archie ! If he 's got no more than a minute to live I 've got to help him . p. 31 ARCHIE ( Ashamed . ) All right , girl . I 'll help him . I 'll fetch him here . Stand at the door on the street to see if anyone 's about . Hurry , now ! ( ROSE runs to the door on the street , ARCHIE goes off into the parking lot . MAY FOLEY comes in . ROSE tries to get her out again . ) ROSE You ca n't come in here . We 're closed . The place is closed . FOLEY I 'm May Foley , girl . Archie and I are old friends . I 've been away . I 've just come back . ( ARCHIE comes back in , dragging the limp and bloody BODY of the young man . ) ARCHIE Rose ! For God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Runs , followed by MAY FOLEY , a woman of fifty or so , dressed to kill . ) The poor man ! The poor man ! FOLEY ( Helping ARCHIE . ) Here , Archie , over here ! ( She pushes two tables together . ) Get him up here ! ( They get him up on the tables . ) I 'll help the poor dear boy ! ( She takes the glass of brandy from ROSE 'S hand . ARCHIE lifts the young man 's head while MAY pours a little of the brandy into his mouth . And finally all of it . ) Well , now , who did this ? p. 32 ARCHIE Wait a minute , will you , May ? Rose , bolt the door ! ( To the MAN . ) Listen to me , you 're with friends ! You 're with friends , do you hear ? May , can you do something for him ? FOLEY We can give him some more brandy ! Who is the poor boy ? ARCHIE He was shot a half hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUNG MAN ( Slowly . ) Happy birthday ! ARCHIE What do you mean , man ? Tell us , will you ? What do you mean ? ( The YOUNG MAN 'S body leaps up suddenly , sags enormously , and then is limp . ) Oh , Christ ! FOLEY ( Folds his arms . ) What a sin to kill a man like that . Who did it , Archie ? ARCHIE I 've got to get him back . I 've got to get him where they left him before somebody steps into the place . ( He picks the MAN up again . ) FOLEY Here , let me help you ! You 're not his age , you know , though he 's dead and you 're still alive . ( They go out together with the YOUNG MAN . ) Now what 's all this about happy birthday ? ARCHIE How should I know ? He said it to the Judge , he said it to the Firing Squad , he stayed alive long enough to say it once more to me  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROSE comes back into the place , runs after them. ) p. 33 CURTAIN p. 34 Act 1 , Scene 3 ACT ONESCENE 3 It is ten minutes to one that night . ARCHIE is behind the bar , MAY FOLEY is standing further down the bar , ROSE is sweeping toward the door of the kitchen . ARCHIE Well , there it is . The whole eight hours , not one customer , except the poor boy from the grave . Not a soul from the living world . FOLEY Well , I like that ! What world do you think I 'm from ? ARCHIE Except you , May . ( Pauses , glances at her . ) One of the thirty-nine they killed today was not unlike yourself , May . FOLEY Impossible . There is no other woman like myself . I 've been around a long time and I 've never seen another . Where do you find women who wear clothes the way I do ? And they 're not expensive clothes , either . If I spent my money on clothes I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've always drunk the best of everything , have n't I ? Or travel the way I travel . I bought the car myself and learned to drive . I drove across the country and back . I saw my three sons . Oh , they 're strangers in a way , and I suppose I embarrass them , but not one of them turned his back on me , and I 'll tell you why , too , Archie . A man 's mother is his mother , that 's all  --  even if it 's me . They were astonished of course . Their father stole them away when the oldest was five and I myself was only twenty-one or twenty-two . But I kept track of them . They 're good boys . Married , got kids of their own . Christ , they 're unhappy , though . Do you understand what I mean , Archie ? For all their success and happiness , they 're unhappy . I see it in their eyes , poor dears . Now , I did n't mean to interrupt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARCHIE Ah , you 've done nothing but tell me the story of your year of travel all night as if you 'd gone and found the Holy Grail or something twice as good . And you do n't seem to understand what 's happened . They 've made a slaughter house out of the place . One of the thirty-nine they killed today was a woman not unlike yourself and when the time came for her to say anything she wanted to say she said , " I 've got a son some place . What 's going to happen to him ? " " How old is your son ? " the Judge said , and she said , " Well , I guess he 's about thirty by now . What 's going to happen to him ? " Well , they asked her some more questions and it turned out she 'd had a son about thirty years ago who 'd died when he was three years old . I mean , she suddenly remembered that he 'd died , and she began to cry because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette . She was a drinker . I poured her a double brandy because she was still crying , but just before she tossed it down she stopped crying and said , " Well , here 's looking at you . " I mean , for an instant there  --  just before taking the drink  --  she forgot they were going to shoot her . I mean , there she was at the last minute remembering and forgetting . ( Pause . ) Not one customer the whole night . Oh , they 're afraid all right , and I ca n't say I blame them . FOLEY What did she do ? ARCHIE Who ? p. 36 FOLEY The woman , Archie . The one you were just telling me about . What did she do wrong ? ARCHIE Oh , hell , I 've forgotten . None of them did anything wrong . Rose ? What did that woman do that asked what was going to happen to her son , and then it turned out her son had died almost thirty years ago ? What did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded me a little of May here . ROSE Her name was Margaret Cathcart . She was fifty-five . A long history of shoplifting . She wore a big hat and laces and long gloves . She got into somebody 's house and went to the nursery where a small boy was sleeping . She picked the boy up and went through the house to the front door when the boy woke up and began to cry . ARCHIE Yes , that was it . There were so many of them I forgot what she had done . Well , now look , the both of you . It 's after one now . You 'd better get going . ( ROSE looks at him strangely . He looks at her . ) FOLEY Well , it 's only around the corner for me , Rose , but I 'll walk you to your door . ROSE ( She is frightened . ) Yes . That 's awful nice of you , May . ARCHIE Oh , May . You 'd better not come around till after five tomorrow . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Of course I 'll come around . ARCHIE But you ca n't ! The place is a Court of Justice from ten to five , I tell you . Do n't come by until after five , that 's all . FOLEY Well , all right if you say so , Archie . ARCHIE Here . Here 's one for the road , May . And one for you , Rose . FOLEY ( Lifting her glass . ) Well , here 's looking at you . ARCHIE God bless . ROSE Good luck . ( They ALL drink . MAY and ROSE go , saying goodnight . ARCHIE bolts the door , turns down the light , stands at the Center of his place , his head bent forward , thinking . He hears a SOFT RAPPING at the door on the parking lot . He turns in terror . The door knob is turned . He backs away . The door opens slowly and the shoplifting woman he has just spoken about , who is in fact not unlike MAY FOLEY , steps in . ) WOMAN What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's dead . WOMAN He 's not dead . I saw him . I held him in my arms . When they took me away he cried . What 's going to happen to him ? p. 38 ARCHIE He 'll be all right . WOMAN I do n't want anything bad to happen to my son . ARCHIE He 'll be all right . He 's with good people . WOMAN I 'm awful worried about my son and  --  I need a drink . I need a good stiff shot , so I can sleep . I ca n't sleep . ( ARCHIE pours her a drink and one for himself , his hands shaking . She picks up her drink and he picks up his . ) I do n't know what 's happened to me lately . I 'm awful nervous , scared to death of the least little thing . ( She looks at the glass in her hand , then at ARCHIE . ) Well , here 's looking at you . ( They drink . ) ARCHIE He 'll be all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you sure ? Are you sure he 'll be all right ? Forever and ever ? ARCHIE Yes , I 'm sure . WOMAN I feel better now . I feel much better now . ( She moves backward and out , closing the door behind her . ARCHIE pours himself another drink , tosses it down quickly , goes to the door . He tries the door . It is locked . He goes to the door on the street and stands there pathetically . After a moment there is a SOFT KNOCK. ) p. 39 ARCHIE Who is it ? ROSE 'S VOICE It 's me , Archie Rose . ( ARCHIE unbolts and swings the door open and ROSE comes in , carrying a small rattan suitcase . He stands a moment staring at her . ) ROSE I had to come back , Archie . I 'm sorry . I could n't stay there . I just could n't . You 're not ashamed of me , are you ? Not ashamed of the way I turned out ? I did n't mean it to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very tired . But I 'm not tired any more . And I 'll make a good home for you . You 're not ashamed , are you , Archie ? When you told me to go with May you were ashamed , but you 're not any more , are you ? ARCHIE No , Rose . No . I 'll tell May tomorrow . ROSE Tell her what , Archie ? ARCHIE I 'll tell her you 're my daughter . I 'll tell everybody . ROSE No , you could n't do that , Archie . They know about me . You could n't do that . I would n't let you do it . ARCHIE I could n't tell her tonight , but I 'll tell her tomorrow . ( Pause . ) I 'll tell her because it 's the truth in a deep and strange way it is the truth . ( She walks to him slowly , shyly . He embraces her as a father embraces a daughter , each of them ashamed , hurt , frightened . ) The whole world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted by the homeless living , too . Now I 'm scared , Rose . p. 40 ROSE Do n't be scared , Archie . I 'll make a good home for you . ( She picks up her suitcase and goes up the stairs while ARCHIE stands at the bar , watching. ) @x It is fifteen or twenty minutes to ten the following morning . ARCHIE CROOKSHANK comes down the steps , goes to the door on the street , opens it , looks up and down , returns , goes behind the bar and examines what he 's got on the shelves . ROSE steps out of the kitchen . She is wearing a new dress , she has n't put on makeup , and she 's combed her hair differently . She looks new and serious , like a little girl playing house . She has two cups of coffee on a tray . ARCHIE You 've been up half the night , have n't you ? ROSE I thought I 'd get up early and get things started in the kitchen . ( She sets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've made bean soup , and I hope they like it . ARCHIE Who ? The poor souls who happen to be still alive at lunchtime ? ROSE Yes , Archie . ARCHIE They 'll like it all right . ROSE I used up everything in the kitchen . I had to . There was almost nothing left . ARCHIE Whatever it is , they 'll like it because it 's the last eating they 're going to do . ROSE They do n't know that , though . p. 42 ARCHIE They know it , but they wo n't believe it . They pretend it 's just another poor meal they 're going to eat until things get better and they get to the wonderful meal they think they 're going to eat some day . The first supper , so to say . ROSE The first supper ? Do you have a meal like that , Archie ? ARCHIE Sure . I 've had it all my life , but I 've never sat down to it . ROSE What is the first supper , Archie ? ARCHIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for it . Everything 's got to be in order . You ca n't have anything troubling your soul . You 've got your home and your family and everybody 's in good health . It 's a fine cold day and you 've been out with your wife and your kids for a long walk , and you 've come home just before evening . There 's some leaves to rake into a pile and burn , and you do that while your wife goes inside to get supper . Some of the kids are out there with you , and you 're smelling the smoke of the burning leaves . The kids look fine , and your wife 's getting more beautiful every day . She 's had a lot of kids  --  not just one or two , or two or three  --  she 's had seven or eight of them , and she 's still a beauty . The kids love her and she loves them , and every kid is different . Every one of them 's a lot of trouble , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The older girls are inside helping her , talking about love and marriage and men , and the older boys are outside talking about the things they want to do before they get married and settle down  --  a trip around the world , to see the whole thing  --  an exploration trip , in Brazil maybe  --  and things like that . Your wife comes out to the fire with a glass of cold wine for you , and one for herself , and you touch glasses and look at each other and smile because you belong to each other , and like it , with all its troubles , and your kids look at you out of the corners of their eyes and smile to themselves because they belong to each other , too , and to you and your wife , and like it , too , with all of its troubles . After the drink of cold wine you go inside and everybody sits down at the table . Well , the food 's important , but the food 's not what counts in this meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it we 'd have  --  well , home-made bread , baked in the morning . Fresh butter . Roast beef . Baked potatoes . Cheese . Tea and coffee and milk . But if it was bean soup , bean soup would be all right , too . That 's the meal I 've always wanted to have some day . And every one of the poor souls who 'll be eating the bean soup at lunchtime today is going to pretend it 's just another poor meal until things get better and they get to that wonderful meal they 're going to eat before they die . Well , they 'll never eat that meal and neither will I. I guess nobody will . p. 43 ROSE But it could happen so easily , Archie ! ARCHIE Yes , it could , I suppose , but it never does . Well , that was good coffee , Rose . ( ROSE goes off with the cups . ARCHIE straightens out a chair . MAY FOLEY comes in . ) FOLEY ( Cheerfully . ) Now , Archie , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me to go . I 've got something to tell you . ARCHIE You 've got to get out of here . FOLEY Not until I tell you . ARCHIE They 'll be here in a minute , May . Come and tell me after five this evening . FOLEY I 've got to tell you now . In the middle of the night somebody knocked at my door and woke me up . I was never so scared in my whole life . I did n't say a word , hoping whoever it was would go away . Well , he did n't go away . Instead , the door opened and a young fellow stood there . ARCHIE Ah , you were dreaming . FOLEY I swear to God I was n't dreaming , Archie . If I was dreaming I would have screamed . The minute I saw him I stopped being scared . He was just a boy , lonely and lost . He came to the bed and knelt there and cried . It was as if he was my own son . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . That 's all right . " p. 44 ARCHIE Who was it ? FOLEY Well , I do n't know , Archie . I 'm trying to tell you . He looked a lot like the poor boy who came in here last night and died , though . ARCHIE Well , what did he say ? FOLEY That 's just it . He did n't say a word . Not one word . He just cried , and then after a while he got up and went out and closed the door behind him . ( Pause . ) Well , this is the part I ca n't figure out , Archie . After he was gone , I went to the door to lock it again , but it was already locked . I swear it happened , Archie . Now , why should a thing like that happen to me ? I was awful scared at first , but after I saw him I was n't scared , I was proud . Proud that he 'd come to me  --  an old bag like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe me , do n't you , Archie ? ARCHIE All right , all right , May , I believe you . Now get out of here before it 's too late . FOLEY I 'm going . ( She turns to go just as the JUDGE and the OTHERS come in . ) JUDGE Ah , good morning , Mrs. Crookshank . It is Mrs. Crookshank , is n't it , Mr. Crookshank ? ARCHIE ( Trying not to hesitate . ) Yes . Yes , it is. p. 45 JUDGE Well , that 's fine . We missed you yesterday , Mrs. Crookshank . We were a little short-handed , especially at lunchtime . You will be a great help , and of course you will be paid for your work . Well , I see everything 's in order . Take your places , gentlemen . ( ROSE comes out of the kitchen . ) Miss Crookshank . ( ROSE halfnods . ) ROSE ( Softly . ) Good morning . JUDGE Take your place , please . ( To MAY . ) Mrs. Crookshank , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) FOLEY Yes , sir . JUDGE ( Taking his place . ) You 've prepared a good lunch ? FOLEY Well , yes . Yes , sir . ROSE Bean soup . FOLEY Yes , bean soup . ROSE But there 's a shopping list to fill . JUDGE Very good . Mrs. Crookshank may be excused to attend to the shopping . ROSE Here 's the list . ( She hands MAY a list . ) And here 's the ration coupons . p. 46 ARCHIE I 'm afraid I do n't have any money in the cash register . I had no customers last night . JUDGE You 've filled out Form 333 , Mr. Crookshank ? ARCHIE Yes , it 's here . ( He hands it to the JUDGE , who goes over it quickly . ) JUDGE Bailiff , this seems to be in order . Will you adjust it , please ? ( The BAILIFF takes the form , counts out money , hands it to ARCHIE , who hands some of it to MAY . ) Very good , then , Mrs. Crookshank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . FOLEY Yes , sir . ( She goes . ) JUDGE Well , I see we have another minute . I 'm sorry you had no customers last night , Mr. Crookshank . None at all ? ARCHIE No , sir . JUDGE A healthy sign . Excessive drinking is an offense against the people . ARCHIE I serve food , too , and my customers do n't drink excessively . JUDGE Court is open . The first Accused , please .

On it , however , is lithographed on this side a picture of someone called My Father , and on this side a picture of a house called My Father 's House .

Guards ! ( The GUARDS start to go off with her . ) ARCHIE What about her drink ? JUDGE She is entitled to a drink , Mr. Crookshank . You 're quite right . ARCHIE What 'll you have ? ELINOR ( Like a child . ) Oh . ARCHIE How about a little brandy ? ELINOR Oh . ( ARCHIE pours one . SHE drinks , the GUARDS go off with her , the pace is kept up in the usual manner . ) JUDGE Next Accused , please . And see that you keep up the pace . ( This time the ACCUSED is a YOUNG MAN . ) PEOPLE 'S ATTORNEY Edward Hawkins . Age twenty-three . Unemployed . Writes poems . Never works . Steals groceries . Rest . ACCUSED 'S ATTORNEY Rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDWARD My reason for seeking a Fellowship is to enable me to finish a trilogy of heroic poetry which is to concern itself with man 's eternal struggle for truth and meaning . The first book of the trilogy has been started and concerns itself with man 's eternal struggle for peace and quiet . The second book is in outline and concerns itself with man 's eternal struggle for home and hearth . The third and final book is still in a nebulous stage but will concern itself with man 's eternal struggle for food and drink . ARCHIE What 'll you have ? EDWARD Brioche and coffee , half and half . ARCHIE Better have this brandy and a cigarette . ( He pours , the POET drinks , he offers him a cigarette , lights it for him . ) EDWARD If I win the Fellowship , I know I shall produce something memorable . JUDGE Guards .

You 've made a bloody slaughter house out of my saloon and I 've kept my mouth shut the whole time , out of cowardly fear and eagerness to get to my own silly lunch and sleep , but if you 're going to start butchering children , too , as well as the aged and infirm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then by God pass your dirty sentence on me , too , for I will not live in the same world with you ! ( He stands beside the SMALL BOY , in the place of the Accused . ) BAILIFF You 're out of order ! Get back to your place ! ARCHIE Do n't tell me I 'm out of order , you stupid rubber-stamp of a man ! ROSE Archie , for God 's sake , get back in your place before it 's too late ! p. 58 JUDGE One moment , please , Miss Crookshank . ( He glances at ARCHIE , as if with charity . ) Mr. Crookshank  --  ARCHIE Do you call yourself a Judge in a Court of Justice ? Do you think for a minute that you can live in your own world , in the fantasy world you have made out of your panic and fear ? A world in which you are terrified even of a child  --  this small boy who would walk out there and be shot and not know such a thing was unusual , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , were n't much different from him ? You yourself have n't any more brains than the child here . Do you think you can survive in your own sick world ? Like all the others you 've each had a mother and a father , and you may have children , too . Where do you think you are going to live in this world you have made ? JUDGE ( Patiently . ) Mr. Crookshank  --  ARCHIE I 've got no more brains myself than any of you here , but it 's no good putting ignorance with power , is it ? Power must be put with intelligence and kindness . You know how ignorant you are . How can you allow yourself to have power , too ? ROSE Archie , for God 's sake , stop it ! ARCHIE If you must be ignorant , you must try to be kind , too . p. 59 JUDGE You there ! Guard ! Stop him ! ( One of the GUARDS raises his rifle and aims it at ARCHIE . ) ARCHIE I wo n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoulder , young man . And you wo n't forget it , either . JUDGE ( Growing angry . ) Stop him , Guard ! ROSE ( Standing in the line of fire . ) No ! He does n't know what he 's saying ! He 's a father ! He 's lost his senses ! ARCHIE Stand aside , girl ! JUDGE Take her aside , please , Bailiff ! ( The BAILIFF tries to take ROSE aside but she will not be moved . ) ROSE No ! You ca n't take me aside ! He 's my father ! He 's a good man ! You ca n't kill him ! ( MAY FOLEY comes in lugging two shopping bags loaded with groceries . ) FOLEY Now , what the devil is this , dearies ?

You 're not alone at all in the world , for every woman who 's still half a woman is your own dear mother , so you need n't look at everything with such dark sorrowful eyes . Why , I 'll make you cookies , I believe . I 'll learn how . I 'll read a recipe , if it 's cookies your blessed little heart desires . Is it cookies you want ? p. 60 BOY I do n't want anything . FOLEY Now , who is it 's annoyed the boy to make him reject everything so bitterly ? I 'll slap the face of anybody who 's twisted the love in this boy around to hatred . ( The GOVERNMENT MAN comes in . ) JUDGE ( With controlled rage . ) Mrs. Crookshank , will you please put the Accused down in his proper place ? FOLEY The Accused ? This boy ? Ah , you make me sick . His proper place , did you say ? His proper place is right here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm wearing and the scent of the perfume of a woman who is a woman . It was not so long ago I had three handsome boys of my own , though they were n't the man this fellow is . If he hates , you know damned well he 's got reason to hate . I 'll put him down in his proper place , I will . I 'll be his mother , and Archie 'll be his father , and I 'll put him down upstairs in a home where he 'll be loved . As for the rest of you  --  whatever it is you 're doing here  --  why , stop it ! ( She turns grandly to go . The BAILIFF grabs her . ) Stop it , I said ! ( She hauls off and slaps him across the face . ) BOY ( Delighted . ) Do it again ! FOLEY Just let him lay another hand on me and I 'll do it again , dearie . ( She goes off grandly , up the stairs , and slams a door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARCHIE 'S . The GOVERNMENT MAN strolls through the silent crowd to the end of the bar , EVERYBODY 'S eyes on him . He pours himself a drink and tosses it down. ) p. 61 GOVERNMENT MAN I have come with a new directive . You will all be good enough to close your mouths and return to your places . The wrath of a mother should by now no longer astonish you . ( He brings a document from his pocket , opens it , and studies it a moment . He notices the GUARD with the rifle still pointed at ARCHIE . ) My dear fellow , will you please put that rifle down , or press the trigger ? ( The GUARD puts the rifle down with relief . ) JUDGE It was necessary to order the Guard to stop Mr. Crookshank . He was inciting to riot , but the Guard disobeyed his orders . GUARD The boy is my son . I was afraid to speak up for him myself . You ca n't expect me to shoot a man who was n't afraid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates his mother , too , but he did n't always hate us . It 's just these past nine months . JUDGE The nine months of the Republic , is that what you mean ? Do you realize what you 're saying ? GUARD Yes , the nine months of the Republic . Yes , I realize what I 'm saying . JUDGE ( To the GOVERNMENT MAN who has poured another drink and has lifted it to his lips . ) It is Mr. Crookshank who is responsible for the present situation . p. 62 GUARD It is not Mr. Crookshank . It 's my son . GOVERNMENT MAN ( Tossing down his drink . ) That 's two , Mr. Crookshank . Will you enter it on Form 333 , please ? ( He looks at the JUDGE . ) I will ask everyone here to keep his big mouth shut while I open my own to read the new directive . ( He reads . ) To the Servants of the People of the Republic . Instantly upon the reading of this directive , its terms will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Justice , including Judge , Bailiff , Attorney for the People , Attorney for the Accused , and Court Guards will exchange places with the six Accused next in line for trial . The first of the Accused will take his place as Judge , the second as Bailiff , the third , fourth , fifth and sixth as Attorney for the People , Attorney for the Accused , and Court Guards respectively . And in that order will the members the previous Court stand trial . That is all . GUARD That 's O.K. by me . I 'd like to embrace my son once again before I 'm shot , that 's all . JUDGE I do n't understand . GOVERNMENT MAN It 's not necessary for you to understand . I do n't understand any too well myself , and I expect the worst for myself  --  ( He tosses down another drink )  --  that 's three , Mr. Crookshank . But that 's the directive . p. 63 JUDGE Who is responsible for the directive , may I ask ? GOVERNMENT MAN You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the same source which has issued all of the directives during the nine months of the life of the Republic . I did not question the right of the source to send forth any previous directive . I can not question its right to send forth this one , and I doubt if you can , either . JUDGE But I have served the Republic faithfully , holding high at all times the deep and mysterious interests of the people . GOVERNMENT MAN No doubt , and it has been much the same with myself , though I now wish I might have been a saloonkeeper . You and I will both continue to hold high  --  at this time  --  the same deep and mysterious interests of the people , as set forth in this latest directive . You will take the place of the Accused . ( The JUDGE moves around the bar to where Archie has been standing , and stands there . ) Bailiff , read off the names of the next six Accused , and let us follow the instructions . BAILIFF ( Examining papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . ( STEPHEN LOCKHEAD is a man of about fifty with a dejected countenance. ) p. 64 STEPHEN If it 's all the same to you , let 's skip the baloney , give me the free drink and the free cigarette , and take me out to the empty lot and shoot me , the way you shot all the others . GOVERNMENT MAN Stand there behind the bar , please . You will serve as the Judge of this Court of Justice in the next six cases . STEPHEN What about the free drink ? GOVERNMENT MAN It is not mentioned in the directive , but here . ( He pours and STEPHEN tosses it down . ) STEPHEN How about one more ? I have n't had a drink in twenty-four hours and I 've got the shakes . GOVERNMENT MAN Very well . Please keep count , Mr. Crookshank . ( He pours another and STEPHEN tosses it down , too . ) STEPHEN Is this where you want me to stand ? GOVERNMENT MAN Just a little to the right . The second Accused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with BOY of seventeen or eighteen who might be feebleminded . ) GOVERNMENT MAN Anthony Beacon ? ANTHONY What ? p. 65 GOVERNMENT MAN Are you Anthony Beacon ? ANTHONY Who ? GOVERNMENT MAN Stand behind that man at that table there , please . ANTHONY What ? GOVERNMENT MAN ( Takes him by the arm gently and places him behind the BAILIFF . ) He may be deaf . ( He nods to the BOY . ) ANTHONY ( Very swiftly . ) What do you want with me ? What do you want with me ? What do you want with me all the time ? GOVERNMENT MAN The third Accused , Bailiff . BAILIFF Gordon Peecham . ( The GUARD brings in a down-in-the-heels intellectual who is smiling contemptuously . He speaks softly . ) GORDON Well , I guess I do n't even get lunch . I wanted to eat once more . I had forgotten what a strange and wonderful thing it is to eat . I wanted to taste whatever it might be very carefully for the last time . Where do I stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Attorney for the People . GORDON I beg your pardon . GOVERNMENT MAN A new directive . I will explain further in a moment . p. 66 GORDON One question , if I may . Am I apt to have lunch , after all ? GOVERNMENT MAN Yes . Bailiff , the fourth Accused , please . BAILIFF Dora Livingston . ( The GUARD brings in a WOMAN of twenty-five with a harsh , loud voice . ) LIVINGSTON O.K. , shoot me ! I 'm just a plain ordinary tramp who flopped at everything decent , and I hate your guts , every dirty one of you . GOVERNMENT MAN Miss Livingston will be the Attorney for the Accused . Will you stand over there , please , Miss Livingston ? LIVINGSTON I 've had too many jokes played on me already . Lay off me , will you ? Just lay off . GOVERNMENT MAN Miss Crookshank , will you tell Miss Livingston no one is playing a joke on her . ROSE It 's a new directive . You are to defend the Accused . LIVINGSTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody ! I never was in this bar before in my life , but if anybody here remembers Joey Turner who had Joey 's Joint for so many years , he was a friend of mine , and maybe you could let me have a drink on credit . GOVERNMENT MAN Of course . ( He pours one , hands it to her , she tosses it down . ) Will you stand over there , please ? ( She does so . ) The fifth Accused , Bailiff , please . p. 67 BAILIFF Samuel Croffit . ( The GUARD brings in a very high-strung man of about twenty-two . ) GOVERNMENT MAN Samuel Croffit ? SAMUEL Yeh . That 's me . Yeh . I 'm Samuel Croffit , and I wish to God I was n't . GOVERNMENT MAN You will be one of the two Court Guards . Guard , hand him your rifle . ( The FATHER-GUARD does so . ) Stand there , Mr. Croffit . Guard , stand here . ( The GUARD goes and stands near the JUDGE . ) The sixth Accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUARD brings in a fat little man of forty-five or so who is in a panic . ) GOVERNMENT MAN Leander Lawford . LEANDER Yes , sir . GOVERNMENT MAN You will be the second Court Guard . Guard , hand Mr. Lawford your rifle . ( The GUARD does so , and on his own goes and stands beside the other GUARD . The OTHERS of the deposed Court go and stand behind the GUARDS . ) STEPHEN I 'm the Judge . Is that it ? GOVERNMENT MAN Yes , you are . p. 68 ANTHONY What am I ? What am I ? What do you want with me all the time ? GOVERNMENT MAN You are the new Bailiff . ANTHONY What ? GOVERNMENT MAN I will continue reading from the directive . Your attention , please . ( He reads . ) When the New Court is established and the Accused stand where the Accusers stood , the first Accused , formerly the Accuser , will stand trial . His crime against the people will be the same as the crime of his counterpart . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the accusation ? NEW ATTORNEY FOR PEOPLE Stephen Lockhead . Age fifty . Divorced . Three children . Profession , actor . Long history of alcoholism and social irresponsibility . Publicly cursed Republic , ridiculed its achievements , and spit in the eye of a high servant of the people . JUDGE Am I to stand trial on these accusations ? GOVERNMENT MAN You are . Proceed , Attorney for the People . Your duty , I 'm sure you understand , is to impress the court with the guilt of the Accused . GORDON I understand . That may very well be my duty to the Republic , and I would be a fool not to do my duty , I suppose , but my duty to myself still comes first . I have no doubt that the accused , like myself , is not a good man , certainly not a truly good one . Even so , I do not believe any Republic can punish any individual . It can stop a man 's life , which I do not feel improves matters for the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republic . Rather than try this man on the basis of accusations which do not apply to him specifically , I place the entire matter in his own hands . He knows himself best , he will do my work for me , and the people 's work for them . p. 69 GOVERNMENT MAN Quite in order . GORDON You are on trial for your life . Make the most of it . JUDGE I was charitable to no Accused . I insisted on speed in the trials and in the executions . Had I permitted a great deal of time to be taken , had we sought to trace to its source the reason for any Accused 's crime , the Accused would still have been executed . I therefore will not blame anybody or any circumstance for my present position . I am here in the place of the Accused . It must follow that I shall be executed . I am now , for being where I am , not only useless to the people , but dangerous to them . I must be put to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up a fight . JUDGE No . I never did . I ca n't now . I am ready . STEPHEN Whether the Accused likes it or not , his trial will proceed , and at the proper time I will pass judgment on him . Attorney for the Accused , please defend him . LIVINGSTON ( NEW ATTORNEY FOR ACCUSED . ) Who ? Me ? STEPHEN Yes . Defend the Accused . ACCUSED 'S ATTORNEY To hell with the bum . He 's guilty , like he says . STEPHEN Guilty of what ? p. 70 ACCUSED 'S ATTORNEY Guilty of what ? Did n't he have all the others shot ? That 's what he 's guilty of . STEPHEN He was acting on behalf of the Republic , on behalf of the people . The Republic is not on trial , the people are not on trial , he is . He did his duty . ACCUSED 'S ATTORNEY To hell with his duty . I say kill the dirty son of a bitch for killing all the others . STEPHEN Very good . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely on me . I must ask the Accused several questions . First , do you want to live ? JUDGE I would prefer to . STEPHEN Why ? JUDGE I have a son in the Navy who 's been away eight months . I would like to see him again . I have a married daughter who is to become a mother in several months . I would like to see my grandchild . I have a brother who has been farming in the west whom I have not seen in more than twenty years . He was to visit me next spring . I looked forward to seeing him again . There are many other similar reasons , but that 's too bad , is n't it ? STEPHEN You have been in the Republic from the beginning ? JUDGE I was for many years in the underground which established the Republic nine months ago . p. 71 STEPHEN Why were you in the underground ? JUDGE It 's a long story . To sum it up , in the old Government I was an underpaid clerk . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no need to waste any more time . STEPHEN If you were to be set free , how would you live the rest of your life ? JUDGE The same as ever . STEPHEN You would become a Judge again ? JUDGE I would try . STEPHEN Why ? JUDGE I do n't know . STEPHEN If you were now passing judgment on me , what would the situation be ? JUDGE You would have been executed long ago . Make your decision . You have no choice but to put me to death . Your conscience need never bother you . STEPHEN I will pass judgment . ( Slight pause . ) I find the accused guilty  --  LIVINGSTON God damn right he 's guilty ! STEPHEN .  --  guilty of being alive , which is the guilt of all of the people , without exception . This is a guilt that can not be dispelled by measures of external correction or punishment , consequently the decision of the Court will apply to all six of the Accused . I sentence them to live . ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 72 GOVERNMENT MAN Are you satisfied that the six Accused have been tried ? STEPHEN Yes . They 're free to go and live and die . What about me and these others ? GOVERNMENT MAN I must refer to the directive . ( He does so . ) Your attention , please . I read from the directive . Immediately after the trials of the members of the Court of Justice by the six Accused , there will be a recess of two hours , after which the Court of Justice will be re-established on its original basis . If any of the original members of the Court of Justice have not been executed they will return to their places , otherwise their counterparts will remain in their places . ( To everybody . ) Do you understand ? LIVINGSTON Ah , you dirty son of a bitch ! Now we 'll get it , just because you let them all go . GOVERNMENT MAN That is correct . I continue from the directive . The Six Accused which served as the Court of Justice , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand trial , by turn . STEPHEN Well , I guess I cooked my goose  --  and yours , too , Miss . I 'm sorry . If it 's recess , perhaps we 'd better have a drink , at any rate . CURTAIN p. 73 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWOSCENE 2 It is five minutes to five . LEANDER LAWFORD , the fat man , is standing in the placed of the ACCUSED . JUDGE Is there anything you wish to say ? LEANDER I do n't want to be shot . JUDGE That 's understandable . LEANDER All I did was buy more food than I am allowed , but I eat more than most people . That 's nothing to kill a man for . JUDGE The Court is familiar with the facts of the crime you have committed against the people . LEANDER When we judged you , we let all six of you go free . You 've killed the other five . Why ca n't you let me go free ? JUDGE The results of what I shall call the Experimental Trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by whose wisdom , I may point out , I have been restored to my proper post of service . Had the results been of another order , the wisdom of the people would have been repudiated , and it might very well have followed that the conduct of human affairs would have deteriorated to a military dictatorship . Guards . ( The GUARDS push the FAT MAN before them. ) p. 74 LEANDER It 's not fair ! You talk with words that do n't mean anything ! You do n't talk like a human being , you talk like a machine ! It 's not fair ! It 's not fair ! JUDGE Two matters must be resolved by the Court before adjournment . First , the matter of Mr. Crookshank inciting to riot . Second , the matter of the Accused who impelled Mr. Crookshank 's criminal act . VOICE ( Off . ) Guards of the Republic , for the people ! CHORUS OF VOICES ( Off . ) For the people ! ( A VOLLEY OF SHOTS . The COURT GUARDS return and take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report on Mr. Crookshank 's criminal act and hand it this evening to the Chief of the Department of Internal Security for immediate action . That disposes of the first matter for the time being . Now , the second matter . The Accused whose trial was interrupted by Mr. Crookshank  --  what is his name , Bailiff ? BAILIFF John Delamare . JUDGE At the present time where is the Accused ? BAILIFF Upstairs . JUDGE Ask the Court Guards , Bailiff , to bring the Accused to trial . p. 75 BAILIFF Court Guards , you are ordered to go upstairs and bring Accused John Delamare to trial . GUARD John Delamare is my son . I have been a poor father , but I will not drag him down here . My life has been spared once today . ( He and the GUARD beside him lift their rides to their shoulders . ) The Guard beside me is my brother . He and I will shoot any man here who harms my son . We know this act is a crime . We have agreed to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . JUDGE Put down those rifles , both of you , immediately ! BROTHER-GUARD My brother is a father , and so he is more patient than I am . His son John Delamare will be pronounced innocent by you , the Bailiff will put John Delamare 's papers in order , and John Delamare will remain alive  --  somewhere in this world . JUDGE Bailiff . I order you to go upstairs and bring the Accused to trial . ( The BAILIFF does not move or speak . ) BROTHER-GUARD You will say that John Delamare is innocent  --  you will say it now  --  or by God  --  JUDGE ( Shouting . ) The Accused will be tried precisely as all of the other Accused have been tried ! ( He is looking straight at the GUARDS . ARCHIE walks up behind him , slugs him with a blackjack , the JUDGE falls limp , ARCHIE catches him , sets him down behind the bar out of sight. ) p. 76 ARCHIE Now , look here , all of you ! We 're all in the same boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time , but he is still alive . We stood by when grown men and women , no more guilty than any of us , were brought to trial and murdered . Each of us participated in these murders by not protesting by word or act , and so we are all of us murderers . But when a child was brought before us , we were unable not to protest . We protested . We are protesting now , and we are doomed . ( To the GOVERNMENT MAN , who is holding a shot of brandy to his lips . ) Is that right ? GOVERNMENT MAN Quite right . Quite right , Mr. Crookshank . ( He tosses the drink down . ) And that 's the ninth for me , I believe . ARCHIE We shall all of us soon be put to death . GOVERNMENT MAN Quite right . No one here , myself included , can now escape , not even the unconscious Judge , for having permitted such a circumstance as this to arise in a Court of Justice . ARCHIE There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the child . What are we going to do about the child ? GUARD ( Brings his rifle down . ) He must escape . GOVERNMENT MAN There is no place to escape to my dear fellow . This is the world we live in . A home , restaurant , saloon , Court of Justice . It is my duty to telephone the Chief of the Department of Internal Security and inform him , but I assure you I shall not do so . I shall tell you why , also . It would n't do me any good . Anyone else here who wishes to do so  --  whether in the hope of saving himself or because he feels it is his duty to do so  --  may of course do so . Is there anyone who wishes to telephone ? ( He pours a drink and tosses it down while he waits . NOBODY speaks up . ) Then , that 's settled . ( He goes to the door leading to the parking lot and shouts out . ) Court is adjourned ! You may return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the saloon , walks to the front door , and shouts out . ) Court is adjourned ! You may return to your stations , as ordered ! ( He comes back to his place at the end of the bar , studies the bottle of brandy , smiling . ) Then , it 's here we are for the rest of our lives , in Mr. Crookshank 's world . Under the circumstances I know of no better world in which to spend our last hours . p. 77 BAILIFF How much time do we have ? GOVERNMENT MAN This night and some of tomorrow 's day , I should say . PEOPLE 'S ATTORNEY Well , I plan to drink , Mr. Crookshank , and so here 's my money in advance . It 's all I have . ARCHIE The drinks are on the house . The food is on the house . The shelter is on the house . That is , if anybody wants to stay . ACCUSED 'S ATTORNEY Everybody 's got to stay . ARCHIE Not here , they do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left here might report us to the Department of Internal Security . We 'd be taking an awful chance if we let anybody get out of here . We 'd lose the freedom of these last few hours of our lives . ARCHIE Quite so , but this is my place of business , and I am in charge here . Anybody who wishes to go  --  even to report us to the Department  --  is free to go . At any time . ACCUSED 'S ATTORNEY But why , Mr. Crookshank ? ARCHIE Why ? Because I want my daughter to go . ROSE I do n't want to go , Archie . ARCHIE This is our last night . It does n't need to be yours , too . There 's no telling what 'll happen tomorrow . p. 78 ROSE I want to stay , Archie . I have no place to go . I 'm scared . I want to sit down at one of the tables and drink , that 's all , Archie . ARCHIE Before we begin to spend our last hours the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drink , anybody who wishes to leave now may do so , and everybody must know that he may leave at any time , without explanation or farewell . That is how I have always run my joint , and that is how I shall run it tonight , too . ( MAY FOLEY comes down the steps holding the hand of JOHN DELAMARE . ) FOLEY He does n't hate his mother and father at all . ( FATHER-GUARD kneels , holds his arms open to the BOY . The BOY runs to him , he picks the BOY up , they press their faces together , smiling . ) GUARD ( To MAY . ) Thank you very much , Mrs. Crookshank . FOLEY Ah , he 's a darling boy , and awful bright , and good . It 's terrible , almost , how good he is  --  when you know in your heart how he 's going to have to change and be like all the rest of us . When he took his nap , I cried the whole time . GUARD ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) What ? Say it again . ( The BOY whispers again . The FATHER turns to MAY and ARCHIE . ) He 'd like to go home . He 'd like to see his mother . p. 79 FOLEY Well , now , what are you so downhearted about that for ? Of course he wants to go home . Of course he wants to see his mother . GUARD I ca n't go home . I ca n't go home again . FOLEY What 's he talking about , Archie ? ARCHIE We 're in trouble , May . We 're all in trouble . FOLEY Ah , take the boy home to his mother , man . If a man 's in trouble , his wife had better be in trouble with him , and his son , too . GUARD I 'd like to take him home . I do n't know what else to do for him , or for anybody else . ARCHIE Take him home , man . There 's nothing else to do . GUARD Is it all right with everybody ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of you have a nice dinner ? GUARD Well , I wish you knew what this means to me , Mr. Crookshank . I wish I could tell you what it 's going to mean to his mother . Well . Goodbye . ( He turns and goes . He stops at the door . ) BOY Goodbye , May Foley ! FOLEY Goodbye , John Delamare ! ( He runs to her , gives her a big hug , then runs back to his father , the MAN waves , EVERYBODY waves back , and they go. )
