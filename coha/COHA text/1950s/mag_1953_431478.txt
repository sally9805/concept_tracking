A MAN named I. B. Humphreys returned from a business trip of several hundred miles in his six-cylinder 1949 Oldsmobile the other day with a record of 24 miles to the gallon of gasoline at a highway cruising speed of 60 miles an hour . Even at that , his gas mileage was low . He gets 30 miles to the gallon at 40 miles an hour ; 36 miles to the gallon at 20 miles an hour . That is half again as much as an ordinary 1949 Olds will deliver . And he buys his fuel at any filling station . Humphreys ' car is no ordinary Olds . It 's fitted with what he calls a con- trolled-compression engine . Unlike other gasoline engines , its compression ratio ? that is , the amount that its air/gas charge is squeezed on the compression stroke ? varies all the way from 6 ? - to- 1 to 14-to-1 . The engine basically is a standard Olds " 76 " L-head . Humphreys , inventor of a means of getting a wide range of compression ratios , modified it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its combustion chambers : At light load and part throttle , the compression ratio shoots up . When the engine works hard and the throttle starts opening , the ratio drops . The ratio can bob up and down like the float on a fishing line because of a little auxiliary piston in the head of each cylinder . When the piston goes up , it increases the volume of the combustion chamber . When it goes down , it decreases it . It 's that simple . No Other Car Like It Humphreys has the only automobile in the world that operates like this . When he rolled into his garage and switched off his ignition the other day , he completed almost three years and 50,000 miles of controlled-compression driving . His engine is one answer to a fundamental fault of all internal-combustion engines . Ever since World War II ended , the automobile manufacturers have been  | boosting compression ratios to get better gas mileage . The higher the compression ratio , the better the fuel burns , the greater the amount of power delivered . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . the density of the charge in the cylinders swings wildly from low to high and back again as pressure on the accelerator pedal changes . What is needed is an equal amount of squeeze ? an equal amount of pressure per square inch ? throughout the speed range . But the amount of squeeze on the compression stroke is limited . When a car engine is working hard at low r.p.m. ? when it 's climbing a hill at low speed , for instance ? it wants to " ping . " The pressures in the cylinder heads build up . The fuel tends to explode instead of burning progressively . That wastes gas . It 's the necessity for preventing ping under heavy load and low r.p.m. that limits the compression ratio in fixedcompression engines . Yet any of today 's engines could cruise happily , without pinging , at a ratio of 12-to-1 on ordinary gas under light load at high speed . Fixed compressions result in poor gas mileage at light throttle . Denied the chance to put the squeeze on an air/gas charge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the engine extracts only a pittance of the power in the fuel . Ever since the turn of the century engineers have resorted to sundry ways to make internal-combustion engines more responsive to load and throttle conditions without knocking . The Kettering high-compression engine ( PSM , Oct. ' 51. p. 125 ) , using fuel beyond 100-octane rating , is one of them . Humphreys ' modification doctors the ailments of the internal-combustion engine by tailoring the compression ratio to engine load and throttle setting . As the load drops and the speed goes up , the engine becomes progressively more capable of tolerating higher compressions . W. H. Paul , professor of automotive  | engineering at Oregon State College , has worked with Humphreys on the road tests . They report that the engine has been practically trouble-free throughout , and described it in a joint paper read before the Society of Automotive Engineers in 1951 . Critics Are Answered The engine did not get off scot-free of criticism . Engineers from GM , Ford , the Shell Oil Co. and the Ethyl Corp .. asked by Humphreys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get as much gain in gas mileage from variable compression as they could get from raising fixed-compression ratios . Humphreys , a businessman with extensive oil and mining interests , and Paul told their critics that their principle " is not a substitute for any feature of high fixed-compression ratio . " But they remarked that fuels for engines with compressions of 12-to-1 ? like the GM experimental engine ? would be years in coming . In the two years intervening , Humphreys has made improvements on his engine . At full throttle he is getting 15 to 20 percent more horsepower than the standard 1949 Olds Six delivers on premium Ethyl gasoline . Humphreys says his principle can be adapted with no great effort to any engine . " An automobile manufacturer , " he states , " could convert his L-head engine production over to this design at less expense than it would cost him to convert to valve-in-head design . " The application to existing valve-inhead engines he terms " relatively simple .  | "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
