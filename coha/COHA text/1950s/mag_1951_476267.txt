THE United States irritates its allies for the same reasons that rich , frisky , green young men irritate their elders . We are high-spirited . We are cocky . We are flighty . We are often thoughtless . We talk too often and too big . We assume that power is knowledge and sometimes even wisdom . And were always slamming the front door . Every alliance since Adam and Eve has , of course , produced friction . This is because allies , like husbands and wives , have separate personalities , histories , interests , peculiarities , and prejudices . The current Atlantic alliance , however , has at least two special problems : first , it is led by the United States of America , a comparatively inexperienced nation in a hell of a hurry ; and second , that nation has forced the old leaders of the Western world into a secondary position . In short , there is a " displaced nations " problem in addition to a " displaced persons " problem in the West , and even if we led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes do n't , the British and French would be annoyed .. This is theircentury to be annoyed . In the eighteenth century they annoyed everybody else , including us . In the nineteenth , they were forced by mutual prosperity and boredom to annoy each other . In the first two quarters of the twentieth , the Germans annoyed them . And now in the third quarter , it is the Russians and the Americans . We annoy them more than the Russians , however , because they do n't have to listen to the Russians . But they do have to listen to us . We pay a lot of the bills . So we lecture the French about the German problem ! With our long background of experience in Southeast Asia , we give them tips on how to flush Communists out of jungles in Indochina , and what to do about Sao Dai and Ho Chi Minh . For the British we have advice about foreign trade and coal mining , and an American admiral to direct the defense of the English Channel . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for all allies , North Atlantic and United Nations : pronouncements out of Tokyo by General Douglas MacArthur on the psychology of the Asiatics . As a matter of fact , our advice is usually pretty good , but that is just the point : there is nothing that annoys Mama and Papa more than advice from Junior , especially if it involves criticism and truth . The British have known for thirty years what they ought to do about their foreign trade and their coal mines in Wales , and the French , having tried everything else , agree that they might as well play footsie with the Germans . But to hear advice on these things from the Amer-icans --  ! AYBE if we did n't pretend that we were part of an " equal alliance " things would go down a little easier , but the gap between our public pronouncements on equality and our private demands for authority equal to our power leaves us open to charges of hypocrisy . Especially from the British , who should know . There is seldom a week that goes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freedom and equality , about the " equality " of the free nations , about the " United Nations " army in Korea , or about the decisions of the " twelve " in the North Atlantic Treaty . The Atlantic alliance , however , is not and can not be an equal alliance . " It is not possible to have " equal equality in a military coalition between the United States and Luxembourg , and everybody here and in Luxembourg knows it . Yet we are constantly paying lip service to the principles of equality , of noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries , and of " joint action " when , as a matter of fact , we insist ? quite properly ? on the special position that goes with our special power and our special share of the burden . If we stated the simple truth , which is that the United States has furnished at least 80 per cent of the manpower and suffered over 80 per cent of the casualties in Korea , then the British , the French , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Korea . When , however , we make a great deal of the idea that Korea is a United Nations show , that we are all in it together , and that General Douglas MacArthur is operating for the United Nations in accordance with UN directives , then our alliesexpect to be heard and are annoyed when we brush aside their suggestions . Early this year , the United Nations , with the United States concurring , passed a resolution promising to discuss the future of Formosa with the Chinese Communists if the latter would negotiate a cease-fire in Korea . Late in March , however , General MacArthur stated publicly that peace in Korea might be arranged if people would just stop tying in " extraneous " matters such as the question of Formosa . Also , in that same statement , the General pretended he was talking merely as a military commander , but went on to belittle the Peiping regime and define the terms on which he would talk peace ? all without specific clearance from Washington , and while the fourteen nations having troops in Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate peace . The General is undoubtedly our principal irritant but he is not alone . The same kind of hypocrisy surrounds our participation in the North Atlantic Treaty . Publicly , we insist that the North Atlantic Treaty organization is an equal partnership of twelve nations . Privately , however , we organized it so that the power really lay in a small Military Committee . This is composed not of all twelve members but only of the representatives of the U.S. , Britain , and France ; and even the decisions of the three are usually planned outside the organization by ourselves and the British . This does not amuse the French . Moreover , when it came to handing out the North Atlantic Commands , we insisted , not only that General Dwight D. Eisenhower should be the Supreme Commander ( which everybody wanted ) but also that an American should run the combined navies . Papa , an old sailor , was slightly miffed . FORTUNATELY the Europeans , and particularly the British , who bequeathed us at least our share of Anglo-Saxon hy-procrisy , understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in dubious practices . But the aroused and nationalistic Asiatic , with whom we are now having to deal more and more , does not understand . The legacy of three hundred years of Western colonial domination still rankles . He is often suspicious and even hostile and Ile is extremely sensitive to any Western claims that do not coincide with his idea of the truth . Thus when we talk about the dignity of the individual and the preciousness of each mortal soul , and then name our recent military action in Korea " Operation Killer , " he bridles . Also when we lecture our allies about the American way of life , meanwhile forgetting that we now have allies with black skins and yellow skins , which are not overly popular in the United States , he is scornful . I wrote an article in the Times the other clay about the problem of the Chinese university students in this country . A couple of clays later I had a letter from one of these students , which included the following : This is my valedictory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly . . . . ' Too many non-white foreign students have seen America and they do not like what they saw . Your professed democracy is only for your own kind ; that is , for white people . Your civil liberties here ? the subject of your bombast and typical white man 's gasconade ? are only for those wearing white faces . . . . In the political field , you shout to the four winds your virtues . Many of us foreign students laugh many times because your self-righteousness is so obvious and so insistent . You are against imperialism and yet you support imperialist Europe whence your fathers came . You are against communism , yet you embrace Tito . You are against dictators , and yet look what you did for Franco and Salazar . . . . You are against corrupt regimes , and yet look how you support Rhee in South Korea , Bao Dai of Indochina , Quirino of the Philippines , Sukarno of Indonesia , Peron of Argentina , and other rotten regimes in the Caribbean and Latin America . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are friendly to Italy , Spain , Portugal , and Latin America where other religions than Catholicism are taboo and persecuted . You do not want to be a world power and yet you are all over the world with your power . You said before that Formosa belonged to China and now Formosa belongs to Japan until a peace treaty is signed . You grabbed the Pacific Islands , Japan 's mandates from the first world war , butyou do not say those islands belong to Japan until a peace treaty is signed . .. . There are 28,000 or 29,000 of us foreign students in your country . Many of us come from Africa and Asia and non-white lands . You do a thorough job of antagonizing these non-white students . Have you ever thought what we could do in influencing the thinking of our respective countries ? At Lake Success and elsewhere , one hears this same theme in private , and it fills the press of India and the Orient . " We are making progress at home on these problems , " Assistant Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to recognize the unfortunate impression made in Asia by our own attitudes and legal barriers against the non-whites . And I say that , " he added , " with what remains of a Georgia accent . " III N popular American attitude that annoys our allies almost more than any other , is our tendency to measure sacrifice in terms of dollars and . to assume that the guy who pays the piper ( Uncle Sam ) should always call the tune . This seems fair enough to the Europeans up to a point ; but the point is definitely reached , they feel , when the policy at issue may lead to a general war . The conflicting approaches may be explained as follows : If we are spending 30 per cent of our national budget , we say , why should n't the Dutch do the same ? The Dutch , however , insist on pointing out that a nation with a high standard of living can reduce its standard by 10 per cent or even 30 per cent far more easily than a nation with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50,000 a year net can cut down 30 per cent far more easily than a man with $5,000 . Moreover , what does equality of sacrifice mean ? The Danes , thirty-five minutes from the Red Army , or the Norwegians , who have a common frontier with the Soviet Union , believe they are taking a bigger risk by defying Moscow and joining the North Atlantic Treaty than the powerful Americans , 3,000 miles away . Therefore , when we propose a " limited war " against Communist China , or the President talks publicly about considering the use of the atom bomb in Korea , or Secretary of State Acheson insists upon the rearmament of the Germans ? or any other question comes up that involves the possibility of war ? they feel that their voice in the matter should not be determined by the number of divisions they have on the line . As a matter of fact , on all these questions , the Europeans are annoyed by what seems to be a Washington assumption that military power somehow makes us politically wise . As they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions in order to have a sound judgment about the relationship between Communist China and Communist Russia , or about the rearmament of the Germans . In fact , they think they know more about the Germans than we do , and they find it difficult to be impressed by our current Soviet and German policies , since we have been so positive so many different times about so many contradictory policies toward these two nations in the past five years . Winston Churchill raised the question with us during the last war ( though in the end the idea was rejected by both the British and ourselves ) of devising our military strategy in such a way as to be in possession of the key areas of Europe when it came time to make the peace settlement . The Swedes tried to tell us before Yalta and Potsdam that it was unwise and unnecessary to make so many concessions to the Russians . Almost all the small and middle powers at San Francisco seriously questioned our judgment that the U.S. , the U.S.S.R. , Britain , France , and China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia ; but at that conference , power was the determining factor . In fact , almost all the small nations rebelled against the idea that China was ready to be placed in the status of a great power , with the right of veto in the Security Council , but U.S. insistence on the point prevailed . These mistakes of judgment have undoubtedly affected the confidence of our allies in the judgment of the United States government and when an ally 's confidence is low , his irritability is likely to be high . I ATE last year and early this year , British and French confidence in U.S. Far Eastern policy was so slim that Prime Minister Clement Attlee and the then French Prime Minister Rene Pleven felt that they had to fly out to Washington to see for themselves . Mr. Attlee decided to invite himself on the day Mr. Truman told the press he was considering the use of the atomic bomb in Korea . The events that led up to that visit are revealing . The first press reports reaching London about the atom bomb statement were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abomb in Korea might be imminent . A powerful group of members of the Labor party met at the House of Commons and on the basis of the press report petitioned the Prime Minister to go to Washington . Alarmed , Mr. Attlee asked to be invited , and before he had even received word back the same day asking him to come ahead , he announced to the House of Commons that he was trying to arrange a meeting with the President . Mr. Attlee said publicly at that time that , in his judgment , no decision should be made to use atomic weapons in the United Nations action in Korea unless all nations that had troops fighting there agreed to do so . Mr. Truman refused to meet this condition , however . All he promised was that he would " consult " with the others before he gave the order to use the bomb . This " satisfied " Mr. Attlee , but not the House of Commons . Mr. Pleven came to Washington with similar qualms , though he went home feeling better . After he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Joint Chiefs of Staff , he was asked for his frank conclusions . He said he would go back to Paris and reassure his colleagues that the Americans were " firm but not mad : " He was reminded that " mad " had two connotations in this country : angry and crazy , and he was asked which one he meant . He replied that our first reaction to the Yalu River defeat in Korea indicated that we were angry , and that some people in Paris were afraid that , in our anger , we might make " crazy " decisions . Nevertheless , he concluded , his visit had reassured him . He was particularly impressed with our veteran soldiers : Eisenhower , Marshall , Bradley , Sherman , and Collins , all of whom , he felt , more than any other group of soldiers in the Western world , had taken on something of the qualities of statesmen . " Pre-Pentagonians , " he called them ; that is to say , the veterans who had matured in the clays before the Pentagon had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means of deterring wars . Apparently , only the young air-minded generals and colonels ? the " Post-Pentagonians " ? sustained France 's worry that we might , in our exasperation with the Russians , stumble into a big war . This is a typical European reaction . Acheson , Marshall , Lovett , Eisenhower , and the Joint Chiefs of Staff all impress our allies as moderate , intelligent , well-balanced men bent on following a policy of no-appeasement and no-provocation . What worries them is the evidence that the views of these men may not prevail against the opinions of powerful groups in the Congress . RAISED in the parliamentary tradition , where the executive runs and is part of the legislature , the Europeans do not seem to understand the operations of the American system of divided and equal executive and legislative powers . And this is one of the basic sources of mutual annoyance . Almost all their private conversations with State Department officials convinced them that the Executive wanted to withdraw its recognition of the Nationalist regime in China at the beginning of 1950 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of Chiang Kai-shek . They have long memories of the League of Nations fight in 1920 , when President Wilson urged upon Europe a policy which his own Congrc6s rejected . Similarly , many of them are convinced that United States policy toward Palestine was determined in large measure by domestic political considerations . Likewise , they saw in the President 's decision to send the Seventh Fleet to Formosa at the start of the Korean war an effort , not to " neutralize " Formosa , so much as to neutralize the political pressure of Senators Taft , Knowland , Bridges , and other strong supporters of General MacArthur and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek . Two incidents will illustrate Congress ' capacity to annoy our allies . When the United Nations was debating whether to brand Communist China as an aggressor , the Congress in Washington suddenly passed a resolution , by an almost unanimous vote , telling the UN what Congress thought it should do . This was not welcomed at Lake Success . Moreover , U.S. pressure on the UN to act built up to the point where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the debate to allow the Indian delegate to get information which the latter thought was vital to the decision , though after the vote was taken , two weeks passed before anything was done to implement the decisions of the resolution . Many delegates at Lake Success not only resented the free advice from Capitol Hill and Ambassador Austin 's pressure on them to vote , but even suspected that the Slate Department had helped whip up the public opinion which it used at Lake Success as an argument for an immediate vote . The second incident also concerned the efforts at Lake Success to try to find some basis for peace negotiations in Korea . Most of our allies urged us to make one more effort to try to start peace talks with the Chinese Reds before branding them openly as aggressors . With this in mind , a series of principles were drawn up under which , if Red China negotiated an honorable peace in Korea , we would at least agree to talk with Peiping about other outstanding questions in Asia , including the future of Formosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it failed to make this concession , the efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement in Korea would certainly end . If , on the other hand , the U.S. co-operated and Peiping did n't , the State Department was assured that most of the rest of our allies would then vote to condemn Red China as the aggressor . Under these conditions , Ambassador Austin voted for the peace proposals . When his vote was announced , however , there was a great hullabaloo in Congress , and Assistant Secretaries of State Rusk and Jack Hickerson were summoned to Capitol Hill and severely criticized for failing to consult with the Congress before voting in favor of the peace proposals . At the end of this meeting , reporters were advised by the Senators present that Secretaries Rusk and Hickerson had been severely criticized for the failure to ' check with Congress , and next morning the fivecolumn headline on the front page of The New York Times read , " Connally Rebukes State Department . " As a matter of fact , however , the very same committee that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretaries a day or so before the vote . The chairman of the committee , Senator Tom Connally of Texas , had been told precisely what the State Department was going to do and why ; yet he felt obliged by congressional opinion to act as if he had never heard about the decision until he read about it in the newspapers . His explanation was that he had merely been " told " what was going to happen rather than " consulted . " THE technical difficulties of negotiating with the U.S. government are another source of quiet irritation . We have a way of seeming to agree with the representatives of other countries in the first stage of negotiations . They will bring a proposal to us . We will listen to them and usually we will look and sound sympathetic . Then we will take their proposition to the other interested departments of the U.S. government ? a long and intricate process ? and suddenly come back to them , not with observations on their proposition , but with a fixed position , often quite different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States government position , agreed upon by all interested departments and very hard to change . A variation of this " sudden diplomacy " occurred on the question of the rearmament of Germany . Our real negotiations were conducted , not within the alliance , but within the American government ; and once the State and Defense Departments decided what they wanted to do , the U.S. High Commissioner in Germany , John J. McCloy , suddenly allowed it to be known that we thought Germany could produce ten army divisions . Almost at once , the Secretary of State just as suddenly informed the British and French foreign ministers that the rearmament of the Germans was an essential part of American policy for the defense of Western Europe . This seemed to the British and French a subject on which there might have been a few days ' discussion , anyway , before American policy was crystallized and made public . At least part of the explanation of most of these things is obvious enough . They are the residue of a hundred years and more of isolation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended our isolation . " A nation can sign a treaty ending its political isolation in an afternoon . It can devise a Marshall Plan , raise an army , negotiate a broad alliance in a matter of months . But a whole generation of Talleyrands does not suddenly spring into being overnight to run the new policy . The Congress is stubbornly loyal to its prejudices and does not change its habits casually . Ambitious Senators do not suddenly cease maneuvering to be President . Newspapers do not at once acquire a sense of balance , history , and responsibility . Young men do not immediately spurn the financial opportunities of private business in order to train for the diplomatic service . In short the hangover of isolationism is still with us . We have had Secretaries of State since the end of the war who did not even know the geographical location of some countries for which they were pronouncing policy . Secretary of State Acheson , who has had more experience with foreign affairs than any other head of the State Department since the end of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1949 , and has never been in Asia since the early nineteen-twenties . Dean Rusk , who is in charge of Far Eastern policy and is one of the ablest officials in the Department , has never been in the Far East . These men are , of course , backstopped by officials who have devoted long years to the Foreign Service , but it would not be accurate to imply that our personnel or our political institutions have experience equal to their terrible responsibilities . HE remarkable thing , on the whole , is not that we do so badly but that we do as well as we do . The British had about a hundred and fifty years in which to adjust their education , their institutions , and their mentality to the leadership of the nations . We have had about a decade , which is barely long enough to acquire allies worth irritating . And incidentally , someone could write a lively article on Why Our Allies Irritate Us !                 @ @ @ @
