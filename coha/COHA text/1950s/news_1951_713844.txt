txt Congressional search for evidence linking the White House to the charges of favoritism or improper influence in the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is continuing with the Fulbright Committee 's investigation of Donald 5 . Dawson . - After several hours of sharp and driving questioning of the President 's administrative assistant in charge of personnel , the subcommittee headed by Senator J. William Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas has succeeded in obtaining Mr. Dawson 's side of the story . Up to this point the presidential aide has parried a barrage of questions without giving the committee any startling mto  --  mation to substantiate the implications in the committee report that the White House interfered in RFC mattes s . " To the best of my knowledge , " Mr. Dawson told the investigating senators , " I have done nothing in connection with the RFC that is improper in any way . " Lustron Case Aired At one point , Senator Fulbright cited earlier testimony by an RFC official to the effect that El , Merl Young could not be fired from his high-salaried executive position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Young has been pictured in the committee study as one who represented himself in RFC loan matters as having powerful White House " 0111 . " Lustron Corporation made low-cost steel fabricated houses , It was a substantial RFC borrowei . Earlier testimony had caused the impression that Mr , Young was placed in a high-paying position in the Lustron firm as a reward for his influence in securing the loan . Mrs. Young recently i e-signed as a White House stenographer . With Mr , Dawson on the stand at last , Senator Fulbright read to him previous testimony by Walter L. Dunham to the effect that Lustron was confronted with the need for drastic economies and that the question of Mr. Young 's removal from his nonessential but lucrative position was under consideration by the board . Pressure Denied Mr. Dunham , according to the testimony , had told Mr. Dawson that the head of Lustron protested that Mr. Young could not be eliminated because of " White House pressure . " That White House pressure ? Chairman Fulbright wanted to know . Mr. Dawson said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before President Truman because he thought the President ought to know about it . Mr. Dawson testified that Mr. Truman said , You go tell the RFC to do whatever it thinks is right . Only once in the opening three-hour grilling of Mr , Dawson did a committee member raise a question that the White House aide turned aside on the grounds that it invaded his confidential relationship with the President . That was when Senator John W. Bricker ( R ) of Ohio interrupted Mr. Dawson 's testimony to inquire who was the condidate the White House was considering as a replacement for a forthcoming vacancy on the board of RFC directors . Senator Bricker did not press the question . Prior to Mr. Dawson 's appear-ante before the subcommittee , Senator Fulbright had assured ; him he would not be questioned on his confidential relationships with the President . Republicans on the committee did not give out any such assurance . But Senator Bricker 's withdrawal of the question touching that issue may be interpreted to mean that the Republicans have no wish to intrude upon the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long , pre- , pared statement as soon as he took the oath from Chairman Ful-* bright . In it , Mr. Dawson expressed his desire to cooperate to the fullest , possible extent with this concludin g stage of the RFC study , The statement contained a categorical explanation of practically everything in the committee 's published reports which mentioned Mr. Dawson in any way . Something went awry in the committee staff 's timing , apparently . As soon as Mr. Dawson had finished his formal statement , Chairman Fulbright told the packed chamber that the committee was not prepared to go into the statement , since it had not been presented to the committee until Mr. Dawson took the stand . That does not mean the committee was at a loss for questions , but only now and then did members refer to matters in the Dawson statement , Mostly , Chairman Fulbright held the driver 's seat , firing questions from an endless typewritten stream that must have taken hours of hard digging by the staff .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
