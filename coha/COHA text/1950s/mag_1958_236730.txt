The American professor seldom unpacks his academic robes for anything except founders ' days and commencement , but the Oxford don swathes himself in proper hues for every day , is well aware when he is within nodding distance of such colleagues in full dress as a doctor of philosophy ( scarlet and navy blue ) or a doctor of music ( cream silk with apple-blossom embroidery and sleeves of cherry crimson ) . <P> For years Oxford scholars have been uneasy about certain mutations in academic plumage .

Worse yet , many Oxonians were showing up in startling shades of the traditional colors . Reason : in the university 's seven centuries , no one had ever specified the precise shades for the various degrees . Around the faculty 's high tables in college dining halls , the old guard eyed the robes of the innovators and grumbled of " notorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebels were sharply summoned into line by a new handbook that spells out once and for all the color and cut of the proper Oxonian 's robe . Compilers of the authentic landbook : meticulous Ralph E. Clifford , lead clerk in the University Registry , and elegant Dennis R.
