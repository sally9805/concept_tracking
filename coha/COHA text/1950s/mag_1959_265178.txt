Roly-poly M. ( for Marion ) Penn Phillips , 70. claims he has sold more parcels of land ( an estimated 100,000 ) than any other man alive . What is more remarkable is that most of the land was among the most forsaken and forbidding in the U.S. : the western desert , burned by searing sun and swept by fierce sand storms . Phillips and the 100 land development companies he heads have been prime movers in the great California desert boom . Once a death trap to pioneers , the desert 's rock and sand wastes , with their harsh beauty , dry , pollen-free air and brilliant sunsets , are a delight and a refuge to smog-smothered inhabitants of Los Angeles and other coastal cities . Developer Phillips operates on a simple principle : " You ca n't buy a poor piece of California land ; you can only pay too much for it . " <P> Last week he was once again proving this in his most ambitious project : Salton City , 150 miles southeast of Los Angeles . By the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain . Though the summer heat is high ( up to 125 F. ) and the land is low ( 234 ft. below sea level ) , there is water and there is a major highway ( U.S. 99 ) . By car and plane , buyers hustled to the sun-struck sands and low-lying , spiny , green clumps of greasewood along the shores of 30-mile-long Salton Sea . There they plunked down $1.2 million in one week , bringing to more than $30 million the total for lots purchased in the first Salton Sea resort development . <P> Three years ago , Phillips started buying his 19,600 acres along the west shores of Salton Sea for $2.4 million , divided it into 54,000 lots , most of them about one-third of an acre . Thus far , 11,000 lots have been developed with streets and water ( from a 658-ft. - deep artesian well ) , and close to 7,000 have been sold despite their high ( $2,000 to $4,000 ) price tags . <P> 700 to 4,000 . As a boy on his father 's ranch in the Oklahoma panhandle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says he : " The nastiest thing my mother ever said about anybody was , ' They 're just renters . ' " He gave up a chance at college to go into business , became a real estate man during the Florida land boom , moved to California in 1921 , where he built up a stake selling lots . His biggest successes came after World War II , when he recognized that the logical outlet for California 's pressing population was the desert . <P> Since then , Phillips has had a hand in developing many communities ( see map ) , has lured more and more Californians into the desert , building them houses on the lots he sells . At his Hesperia development at the foot of the San Bernardino Mountains , the population grew from about 700 in 1954 to more than 4,000 now . Acre lots that sold for as low as $795 four years ago are now worth $6,000 . His Edwards Estates at Edwards Air Force Base and Mountain View Estates at Victorville have grown from sandy wastes to thriving communities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the books of his 100 companies ( 1958 sales : $39 million ) , though he admits : " The building stage is the most exciting of all . I ca n't stand the bookkeeping part . I tell them ' I 'll make it and you count it . ' "
