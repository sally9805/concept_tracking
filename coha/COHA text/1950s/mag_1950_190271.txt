Long dominated by a handful of aging masters , French artists have been increasingly aware , lately , of a young master now dead . Francis Gruber was only 36 when he died of asthma and T.B . in 1948 ; his Montparnasse friends remember him as an overpowering gay blade who talked , drank and painted at a furious clip and did all three magnificently . His paintings , on show in a Paris gallery last week , were sad and bony as a squirrel in March-cold and sometimes acid in color , scalpel-sharp in line . They consisted mostly of hollow-chested nudes , their breasts pinched with cold , whose bones and muscles were as clearly delineated as in anatomical drawings and whose eyes were black and full of misery . His landscapes , too , had a withered look . " The sun in Gruber 's sky , " one critic wrote , " is never warm enough to take away the goose flesh . " <P> Gruber 's father , a famed stained-glass maker of Alsace , encouraged him to draw but refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning drawing lessons went well . Under such discipline , Francis Gruber grew up to be one of the finest draftsmen of his generation , though his lines almost never described round , soft shapes . Hard , mean , digging , they hinted constantly at the pain that plagued him . His death meant the disappearance , wrote Paris Critic Waldemar George , of " the only painter who was capable of giving to French art a sense of ... the human values . Our only consolation is to know that his teaching will not be lost . In the end , the young will owe him much . " <P> George neglected to say what France 's young painters would eventually learn from Gruber . Most of them are still experimenting with Picasso 's big , free , arbitrarily distorted forms and Matisse 's arbitrarily souped-up colors . They were not yet inclined , apparently , to follow Gruber 's grimmer , narrower path . <P> If Gruber had any one thing to teach , it was the value of a return to the 15th and 16th Century German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schongauer and Albrecht Drer . Their art had been as strictly delineated , and often as sad and bitter cold as his , though far more ambitious . Had he lived , Gruber might conceivably have come to paint a Crucifixion as great as Grnewald 's . He never got beyond showing how pathetic a nude model and how forbidding a winter landscape can look .
