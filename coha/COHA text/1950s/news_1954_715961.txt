txt There are signs that at least part of organized labor has exercised unusual restraint in the legislative program it offers the 1954 session of the Massachusetts Legislature , The AFL has scaled clown a number of last year 's demands in a bid for bipartisan support . The state CIO , on the tither hand , regards the Republican Party as inimical to labor . tt is sticking to much the same pi ? - gram as last year . Election Yeat Said Albert G. Clifton , legislative agent for the ' Massachusetts State CIO Industrial Union Council , " Bipartisan support for bills favorable to labor is a myth . It would n't do any good to rut back our demands  --  most Republicans would still vote against measures beneficial to labor. - Labor 's current requests for social legislation embodied ' n a total of 38 bills filed by the AFL and CIO  --  go to a Republican-dominated Legislature in an election year . " In recent years , " said Kenneth J. Kelley , legislative agent of the Massachusetts Federation of Labor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and candidates . " In the opinion of some , this close degree Of - collaboration was unwise and inconsistent with the long-range interests of the trade union movement . " Practically all of the federation 's legislative victories at the State House over the years have been the result of bipartisan support . The great bulk of the Democratic legislators together with a few liberal Republicans have united to put our proposals into law . AFL Trims Requests " A nucleus of liberal Republicans is always necessary to offset ' renegade ' Democrats .. . who vote against the interests of workers . By demonstrating a truly nonpartisan political attitude , labor in this state can give encouragement to the liberal elements within the Republican Party . " To this end . the AFL has trimmed some of its legislative requests this year . For example . last year the AFL asked liberalization of the Workmen 's Compensation Act to permit a $45 weekly maximum , which is supposed to represent two-thirds of an injured work er 's ave , - age wages . This year the demand is for $40 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this figure . However , it is going to press hard for a S5 increase in the amount of money a dependent of an injured worker gets . The AFL has been asking in past years for a full holiday on state election days , to allow workers a chance to vote . This year its demand is for four hours . In the field of unemployment compensation , the AFL is asking an increase in weekly unemployment benefits through change from 30 per cent to 40 per cent of earnings . ( The law , changed last year to extend benefits from 23 to 26 weeks , was not amended in this respect . Labor spokesmen declare that this failure took most of the meaning out of the voted change . ) Gun for Slichter Act The CIO , on the same matter , is asking merely an increase to 3313 per cent . Labor is gunning for the Stichter Act  --  the law under which the state may seize and operate plants where a labor dispute threatens public health or safety . Repeal is the goal set by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely and labor may have to content itself with that now , Also , labor is up in arms over recent changes in the Employment Security Law , Delays or inequities in unemployment compensation are expected to mount , If worker protests come in sufficient numbers and in time , labor may have a strong case when its bills for reforms in this field come up for consideration . Both Mr. Kelley and Mr. Clifton agree that last year labor was on the defensive in Massachusetts , This year looks brighter to both men , Mr. Clifton , slightly more cau - tious , said he sees " no marked ' changes either way " ? either very much pro-labor or pro-employer . He says he does detect an inclination of the Legislature to " do something about some of these situations , irrespective of whether the employer groups approve or not . " Mr. Kelley , on the other hand , says he believes the administration wants to be able to present at least a few poslive accomplishments pleasing to labor when it stands on its record n November . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
