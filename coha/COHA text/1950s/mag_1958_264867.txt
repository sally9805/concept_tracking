The new Shepheard 's Hotel glimmered palely in the Cairo night , and its veranda lights were reflected in the Nile . In a fifth-floor suite three-year-old Prince Nawaf of Saudi Arabia lay fast asleep . In the bedroom of a similar suite three floors below dozed the Begum Aga Khan , 52 , a handsome Frenchwoman who was " Miss France of 1932 " and is the widow of the wealthy Aga Khan , who lies buried 500 miles upriver at Aswan . <P> Well past midnight a strapping Negro named Salim al Abdullah , one of Prince Nawaf 's two bodyguards , returned to the hotel . He was carrying a small black bag and had an un-Moslem smell of alcohol about him . A hotel porter took the black bag , accompanied Abdullah to his room , where he put his nightclothes into the bag ; then both headed for the prince 's suite , where Abdullah was to take up his guard duties .

" ( Where is my master ? ) , Abdullah leaped on the Begum , tried to choke the truth from her . <P> Struggling free , the Begum screamed for help , began throwing anything handy at the frenzied bodyguard . In turn , Abdullah hurled a heavy glass ashtray at the Begum , missed , and then was at her again , still shrieking : " Fein sidi ! " The uproar brought the Begum 's Swiss secretary from next door , and the hotel porter and the chef d ' tage came stumbling into the bedroom , pulled Abdullah off the nearly strangled Begum , hustled him outside . A doctor was summoned , and the police . <P> The doctor attended the bruises on the Begum 's neck , face and arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible experience , " she flew off to her villa on the French Riviera , followed by flowers and apologies from Shepheard's. the Egyptian tourist office and the Saudis .

" And from the heart he added : " The King would chop my neck if my master was injured in any way . "
