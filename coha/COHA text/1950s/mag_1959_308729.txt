<P> A flurry of excited advertisements in the Brazil Herald glowed of fabulous land bargains in the wilds of the Mato Grosso plateau . Over a Rio television station , a warm-voiced announcer sold stock by posing an enticing question : " Does your money really work for you ? Some of the luxuries of this world can be yours-a beach , a home , a boat , an airplane . " Such were the latest come-ons of expatriate U.S. Swindlers Benjack Cage ( TIME , Feb. 18 , 1957 ) and Earl Belle ( TIME , Aug. 4 ) , and they seem to prove that good con men , like cats , land on their feet when they fall . <P> Belle , 27 , is Pittsburgh 's onetime " boy wonder " of finance , wanted for bilking three Eastern banks out of $825,000 . Cage , 41 , is under sentence to ten years in prison for embezzling $100,000 from the Texas insurance company he once headed . Both fled south just ahead of justice and took refuge in the fact that Brazil has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one as long as the U.S. permits capital punishment-which is long enough for Cage and Belle . <P> Widows First . Cage set up quarters in a lavish suite at Sao Paulo 's Jaragu Hotel , decided that all the Mato Grosso needed for a land boom was the old backslapping hard sell . He fixed his selling price at $2 to $5 an acre . What if the land is remote ( and no more fertile than tracts being peddled by Mato Grosso State for 35 an acre ) ? One day the wilderness would bloom . Said Realtor Cage , nobly : " I 'm going to work hard and pay back everybody that lost anything in Texas . You betcha , and the first people I 'm going to pay back are those little old widows-yessiree , I 'm going to call them right up to the head of the line . " Cage 's wife , who wears mink despite the heat , is staying by her hard-working husband 's side . <P> Belle and his blondined second wife took a terraced apartment overlooking Copacabana Beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yacht Club ( membership fee : $2,000 ) . Through a front man . Belle got control of two small firms that made abrasives , formed a holding company called Internacional de Mquinas e Abrasivos . He stepped off with appropriate fanfare : a caviar and steak luncheon and a trip to the humming factories in chauffeured Cadillacs for Rio 's leading businessmen . Belle envisioned expansion into a sprawling complex of steel , paper and machine-tool plants . <P> Time to Sell . Last week a major Imasa stockholder staged a surprise inspection of one of the abrasive factories and found " no production , no stocks , only five workers standing around with their arms folded . " Under pressure . Belle sold out his interests , but he still made a profit . His assets mostly liquid again ( partly in U.S. $500 bills ) , Belle declared that he was ready for further opportunity . " If you hear of any little industry selling out cheap , " he told friends , " let me know . I 've got money I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
