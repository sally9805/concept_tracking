" I feel as though I were beginning my second reign , " announced Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi five weeks ago when he flew back to Teheran and to the throne of Iran . " I am older and more experienced , and now I know what I must do . " <P> Two weeks ago , when the young ( 33 ) Shah went out to Mehrabad airport to greet his Queen , returning from Rome , his step was firm , his shoulders back . He had given up sleeping pills , taken up tennis again and was working hard . He was spending long hours in his Saadabad Palace office , conferring daily with his new Premier , Fazhollah Zahedi , and with U.S. Ambassador Loy Henderson . <P> A stream of orders and exhortations has begun flowing from the royal palace . The Shah sent crackling orders to Premier Zahedi to complete immediately an Isfahan irrigation project planned to bring thousands of acres into cultivation . He put pressure behind other reforms : a combined water supply-hydroelectric scheme for Teheran , completion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Zahedi and Finance Minister Ali Amini to speed the return of the royal family estates , taken by Mohammed Mossadegh four months ago to thwart the Shah 's plans to parcel out the land to landless peasants . Under the Shah 's scheme , the peasants will make a small payment for the land , work it with the help of loans financed by the Shah . <P> At his right hand , counseling speed and firmness , was Iran 's ablest and most respected statesman , Court Minister Hussein Ala . Onetime Premier , Foreign Minister , Ambassador to the U.S. and the U.N. , shrewd , 69-year-old Ala was ousted from the court post last April by Mossadegh , resumed his old job after the Shah returned from his brief exile . One result : today , the old , meddling palace camarilla which made and unmade Premiers in backstairs intrigues is gone . Its leaders-Princess Ashraf and the Queen Mother-have not returned to Iran . <P> But aside from Ala and a few others , the Shah is painfully short of talented manpower he needs . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowning at the new Zahedi Cabinet ; they complain that its few able , honest men are outweighed by many unproven ones and a scattering of ministers whose honesty and objectives are , to say the least , questionable . " Perhaps , " said one Iranian , " there are enough honest men in the Cabinet to restrain the dishonest ones . " <P> The Shah , a shy and gentle young man , repeatedly says that he intends to be a conscientiously constitutional monarch , not an authoritarian like his famed father , Reza Shah Pahlevi , father of modern Iran . But the vast reforms needed to ease Iranians ' poverty and the decisive acts necessary to check the underground plotting of the Red-led Tudeh and the supporters of old Mossadegh , must be accomplished fast to save Iran from fresh rebellion and capture by Russia . The new Shah 's most immutable enemy is time .
