Three years ago Norbert Wiener , professor of mathematics at M.I.T. , was a " longhair " who had coined the word " cybernetics " * to wrap up the many-sided science of communication and control devices . Now Wiener 's book , Cybernetics ( TIME , Dec. 27 , 1948 ) , is a classic , and Wiener is a prophet who is listened to by shorthaired , hardheaded businessmen . Many of them agree wholeheartedly that the " cybernetic revolution " he predicted is already in progress . <P> Last week , as guest of honor at a Manhattan dinner of the Society for the Advancement of Management , Wiener described briefly the mathematical and electronic tools that are the basis of modern control mechanisms . Then he launched into his standard warning : automatic factories and mechanical " brains " to run them may come into use too quickly and society may not be able to absorb or provide for the human hands and brains that they will replace . This is very likely to happen , said Wiener , if there is a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men , and the U.S. will have to fill their places on the home front with mechanical men who ( being cheaper and more efficient ) will keep their jobs after the war is over . The ensuing crisis of unemployment , said Wiener , will threaten the stability of society . <P> Frankenstein Monster ? Mathematician Wiener had often said this before , and been pooh-poohed as an alarmist . Last week he was not laughed at . Allen N. Scares , vice president and general manager of Remington Rand , Inc. , told of a machine , UNIVAC , manufactured by his company , that can do most of the numerical tasks now performed by flesh &; blood clerks . In computing payroll checks , for instance , it " reads " ( at 10,000 characters per second ) two magnetic tapes with numbers coded on them . One tape carries all the data about each employee : his wage rate , tax status , pension deductions , etc . The other carries the hours worked by each during the pay period . By comparing the tapes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 employees in only 40 minutes . <P> How many clerks UNIVAC would replace Scares did not say . He was confident that Remington Rand had not created a " Frankenstein monster which can turn upon us and wreck the very foundations of our society . History has demonstrated that there is an ultimate good in every new tool . . . The acceptance is gradual as the new tool proves its worth . It has never occurred as a sudden change . " <P> The Robots . Luther Gulick , president of the Institute of Public Administration , was not quite so confident . He felt that management has certain responsibilities " in the face of the cybernetic revolution . " Said Gulick : " Machines can now perform most of the routine operations performed by human beings in mass production manufacturing , mass clerical operations , and in the exercise of technical control processes . " They can observe facts and reach conclusions from their observations . They can store facts in their memories . They can make decisions based on observed facts plus remembered facts . They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines in motion , keep watch over them and correct their action , keep accounts and make reports at any desired stage .
