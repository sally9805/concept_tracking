In Santiago de Chile , when the conversation turns to politics , civil rights or , above all , women 's rights , someone is sure to mention La Mujer ( The Woman ) . That can only mean one person : Ana Figueroa , 44 , a comely brunette who has spent most of her lively lifetime teaching and politicking for the advancement of women . <P> As chic as she is sharp-tongued , Ana Figueroa has been a formidable figure at many a feminist conference in Chile and abroad . Last week , armed with the diplomatic rank of minister , she won fresh laurels on a larger stage , the United Nations meeting in Paris . The U.N . Assembly , in recognition of her talents and experience , elected her as the first woman ever to head a major committee , the Social , Humanitarian and Cultural group . Overnight Paris newspapers dubbed her " the U.N . pin-up girl . " Ana has had to absorb many such maddening compliments during her career as teacher , inspector-general of Chilean high schools and leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Ana never stopped punching , and won her biggest home victory two years ago when Chile granted votes for women . <P> Taking her U.N . election in stride , Ana let her committeemen know that she expects to be treated strictly as one of the boys . A Saudi Arabian delegate , warning her that the debate might get hot , gallantly offered his apologies in advance . Ana Figueroa told him to forget it . And to a newsman who congratulated her , perhaps a bit too effusively , La Mujer snapped : " Do you know that 51% of the world 's population are women and only 49% men ? Diplomatic representation in the U.N . ought to follow the same proportion , it seems to me. "
