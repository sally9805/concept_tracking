Sir Carl of Heldart : a Novell Victoria Lincoln Drawings by Bernarda Bryson FEW days ago I made a major literary discovery . I had been overtaken with one of those seizures with which every housewife is familiar , seizures in which she is possessed to know , right down to the last bent hairpin , exactly what her house is harboring and where it lies . This recent orgy of mine had been peculiarly satisfying ; the basement storeroom offered a fascinating field for research ; so did the pasteboard cartons up under the eaves . I was quiet again , and already a little bored , when I began on the Saratoga trunk . I do n't know if it is a Sara-toga trunk , actually , but that 's what we call it in our house , an old monstrosity that has taken to itself , through many movings , the detritus that one ca n't quite throw away . I fumbled vaguely past old curtains that fit no windows , brought out a little box of mate-less earrings , wondered dimly what they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back again to provide a similar question for the age to come ; and suddenly , just as I began to realize that I had finally lost all interest in the enterprise and could now return to another careless year or so , all passion spent , I made my discovery . Listlessly , just as I was within an ace of shut-The author of February Hill and , most recently , Celia Amberley , has usually portrayed modern family life with realism and humor . But realism , as the creator of " Sir Carl " vividly demonstrates , does not flower in early youth . ting down the lid , I had stumbled on treasure . In a large manilla envelope , at the very bottom of the trunk , there were notebooks , several of them , and the handwriting on the covers I recognized for the prototype of my own . I began to read , crouched among the rag-bags and the book-boxes . The light was bad , the attic drafty , but I was immobilized in a growing awe . At the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my hand that I have never since recaptured . The work , to be sure , is not all that I believed it to be at the time of writing . Thirty years have brought me a certain detachment . However , I should like to pass it on to you for what it is worth . T HE holograph manuscript , which fills two thick notebooks , appears to be the work of several people . At those moments ( and they are rare ) in which the story progresses with a degree of calm , the handwriting becomes successively a distinguished perpendicular , a dashing backhand , and that bland , flowing script which was the desired outcome of the late Palmer Method . But when the winds of passion blow , the letters shoot up , doubling their size and straining forward , so that the page looks like a cornfield in a summer storm . A journal of the period turned up in the same haul . " Do not read , " runs the warning legend on its cover . " To be destroyed unread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my surprise it turned out , upon examination , to be less an opening of the heart than of the mind , Along the way I came upon this critical dictum : " And if I were cast upon a desert island with only one book , I should want that book to be The Prisoner of Zenda , " Obviously , Sir Carl of Heldart : a Novell was written under strong influence . It is the work of a member of a school ; the spelling alone retains a stubborn individualism . The scene is set with a lavish sweep of the hand : " The opening ball of the Paris season was in full swing . The thoughtful host had provided several darkened alcoves surrounded by potted palms , and although it was early in the evening , all of these were already filled with their usual ! type of occupant . " And then I give you Lucie . " All , did I say ? I correct myself . In one sat a lady alone ! " Lucie Delavigne  --  la petite Delavigne , as theater-going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tiny upward quirk at one corner of her mouth . " We see her first " toying with an extremely flirtatious appearing black ostrich feather fan , her little face touched with enui at the monotony of continual entertainment . " But suddenly she starts forward , tense . " Carl was in Maurevania . But how , how could two men be so alike , in carelessly royal bearing , height , build , voice ? It must be ! But no , no , how ? " But it was , none the less , and presently we have them embraced behind the potted palms . Their ecstasies , however , are short-lived . Carl , it appears , is sole heir to the Duke of Heldart , " a title which does not recognize morgannatic r .. toying with an extremely flirtatious appearing black ostrich feather fan . . . " " It 's your your father the Earl , Sir , " said the man quietly . " He 's dead . " marriages " ; and , passionately as he loves Lucie , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was in full accord with him on this . Flavia of Ruritania had renounced Rudolph Rassendyl for a similar scruple . But Lucie , unfortunately , saw things otherwise . " Her bosom heaved under the Spangled Egiptyan scarf that she wore . ' Oh , what a fool I was ! ' she cried . ' A silly mislead fool . I worshiped you as a God and now . . . . Go ! Go ! Go ! ' " So , " with a tortured little gesture indiscribably like some hurt wild thing , " he leaves her and returns to the Castle of Heldart , where he " flings himself through the great oaken portal tossing his hat and coat to theastonished butler , " and gives over to brooding . One night it looks as if his noble resolution has weakened : he suddenly runs berserk and rips all the portraits of his ancestors to ribbons with his jackknife . But just as he has finished up the last , while the echoes of his manic laughter are still dying away in a ghastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butler . " It 's your father the Earl , Sir , " said the man , quietly . " He 's dead . " ( The persons of title in this book are promoted and demoted from page to page without comment . ) The madness has passed . Destiny has taken over . " Take me to him , " said Earl Carl of Heldart. 1 uiciE , in the meantime , has gone south . " She arived in Florence on a clear morning when Italy was at its best . Going to a splendid old hotel overlooking the sea , she hired rooms . " She casts about for diversion . Upon inquiring for " a stable or riding school where one may hire horses , " she is " directed by an obsequeous waiter to Carranzo 's on the Place del Paradiso which had fine horses for hire . " Immediately ( " Was it Fate ? " I inquire ) her horse throws her and she is picked up , with a slight concussion , by one Michael Trent , a fast worker . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosebuds with a card that said simply , ' May I take you to luncheon at the Rosa del Avantio ? Their terrace garden is superb . ' " Carelessly , she flings herself into adventure . Now we return to Carl . A bitter wind is wailing around the towers of Heldart Castle ( which is , I notice , referred to throughout this chapter as Reslau Castle ) and Carl is at his favorite sport of " staring at the dying embers with unseeing eyes " when he becomes aware of " a faint tapping at the postern door . " He draws his revolver , strides to the door , and flings it open . ( It must have been Stranz 's night out . ) A tall man , heavily cloaked , lurches past him and falls unconscious to the floor . Carl kneels and looks into the stranger 's face . And here conies a sentence that for sheer labor-saving must have few equals in the field of prose fiction : " His own face paled and his breath came in short gasps , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older boy whom he had adored who ten years ago when he was twenty and Carl was fifteen had disappeared on that glorious summer day never to return . " Never you mind what glorious summer day . Carl had a long-lost brother who had just slipped his mind , and now he is free to get behind the potted palms again . Or is he ? Carl writes to Lucie telling her that Frederick has turned up , but the letter goes astray . Frederick just stays quiet around the house . And the Maurevanian government , being still in the dark and much opposed to " morgannatic marriages , " sees to it that Carl is continually thrown in with the Dutehess ( or , occasionally , Countess ) of Rathbergen . " I know about your actress-girl , you silly , silly child , " she tells him ; but for political reasons she suggests that they play along and pretend to have an affair . Unfortunately , the Dutchess reeks sex appeal . " Her hair was black as the wings of night .. her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furiously and his breath coming short . " I had to get back at Lucie somehow , I suppose . Anyway , it all keeps him so busy that it 's several chapters before he gets around to asking Frederick where he 's been keeping himself all that time . When it comes , it 's quite a story ; " I have been in a German prison ... yes , and justly . . . . I stole , huge sums by forgery and jumbled accounts ... oh , I was driven to the wall by my creditors , I was half mad . . . . At last I fought a duel and ... killed my man .... " Fortunately , everyone sees just how it was . Old Stranz drops to one knee and says , " Hail , my Lord , " and Carl , wet-eyed , takes him by the hand . " Frederick , " he says simply , " my brother . " S PRING comes , and Lucie , in Italy , " feels the call of the North once more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says to Trent , " and I want to go hack . I must . " " Trent grasped her and held her in a crushing grasp . ' Michael ! ' she cried . He dragged her into the shaddow . Their lips had met when a shock as of a falling body threw them apart . " The rest of this chapter I find a little baffling . I hope it will be easier for you . The falling body turns out to be that of a certain Roderick Playne , who , with his dying breath , addresses Trent as George Trevor and tells him that " the game is up . " " God ... " run his final words , " Sir Carl has fallen for the Countess and she will tell him all ... and Frederick 's come back . . . what a mess for nothing .. . men .. . guards .. . broke through lines on my horse . . . they got me. ... " n It all , however , appears crystal clear to Trent , who slips off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Put it on . It will be cooler in the car . " And the next words are : " Chapter 15 . In the meantime events moved rapidly in the little kingdom of Maurevania . " This is the book 's sole instance of understatement . Frederick goes for a walk in the woods and is pursued by a poisonous snake . He is something of a naturalist , and , " being well aware that the serpent dreadded water , " he leaps a brook to escape it , spraining his ankle in the process . He swoons , is recalled to consciousness by a soft hand , opens his eyes , and springs " In the meantime events moved rapidly in the little kingdom of Maurevania. " to his feet with a cry : " Isoldel " And a cry returns like an answering trumpet : " Frederick ! " It is the Dutchess of Rathbergen , who had not recognized him with his eyes closed . It seems that she had known him under another name in that German jail . Only he had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to an Englishwoman . We leave them embraced ( " and the sun shone golden and a great Silence reigned " ) and return to the denouement . " Lucie , crouched in the speeding car stared with hidious fascination at the speedometer . forty-six . . . fifty . . . fifty-two . . . . Gradually her mind became drunken with the sense of the deadly speed . . . , This man , Michael , to what strange doom was he bearing her ? " Dawn breaks , and suddenly , ahead , she sees the towers of Ileldart . " Michael ! Stop the car ! Let me out here ! " But he laughs at her . " Do you think I would take you to your lover ? " His face is hard and the car holds to its ghastly 52 m.p.h . " Maddened . . . she flung herself before him .. . trying to wrench the wheel from his grasp , to clutch the breaks . . . " Then , a sickening lurch , and blackness . But Lucie has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the car in flames and Michael dying beside her . She takes a moment to reflect . " Why had she ever dallied with him silly little fool that she was . . . played and forgotten in Italy . . . " His eyes open . " ' Lucie . . . forgive me , Luck . . . Sud-MAGAZINE denly Lucie was filled with a great unreasoning tenderness . ' I forgive you , Michael , ' she whispered and she kissed him . He opened his eyes again and smiled and so smiling he died . " do n't remember writing much of this , but I do remember writing that . I remember the room I was in , my bedroom in Bigelow Street , Fall River ; I remember the very feel of the pencil in my hand . I wrote it in tears , which were not for Michael , or for Lucie , but for the beauty of my own art . It had me stopped so that I hardly cared about doing the final scene at all . It was brief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance about Frederick , offers herself : " You . . . you-will not have to give up your tide . No , hear me . . . . " Her magnaminity sweeps away any little notions that Carl might still have retained about Isolde von Rathhergen , and they stand in each other 's arms . And , the valley into which the car had rolled having now , what with their exaltation and mine , risen into a peak , we conclude : " And at their feet stretched out the country of Maurevania ... arid , beyond that , the world . " Comprehensibly enough , those lines ended not only the book but my own romantic period . I felt that I had got it , my reading and my writing alike passed to other fields , and my next novell was called Cadogan , a Commedy of Culture . It began , " Godfrey Cadogan sat his horses heavily and was kind to his women . " " He opened his eyes again and smiled and so smiling he died . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
