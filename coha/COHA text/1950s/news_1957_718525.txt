txt President Gamal Abdel Nasser gathered his Arab allies together today for a show of unity in the uncommitted southern tier of the Middle East . His primary aim will be to try to keep Egypt from being isolated by President Eisenhower 's newly proposed anti-Communist doctrine for the Middle East , which , for all practical purposes , the Egyptian leader seems already to have rejected . King Saud of Saudi Arabia arrived by private plane from Jidda this morning for a meeting with President Nasser before the desert monarch goes on to Washington for important talks . The youthful King Hussein of Jordan flew to Cairo from Amman in the afternoon . Premier , Sabri el-Assali of Syria has been1 waiting in Cairo since yesterday to take part in the four-power meeting . The four leaders were to hold their first meeting tonight . Advance notices of the meeting in the Cairo press indicate a sense of urgency on the part of President Nasser to try to keep his Arab neutralist bloc // intact so as to present a strong front in any dealings with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he rejected any assumption by the United States that there is a power vainium in the Middle East but that if there was it would be filled by " Arab nationalism . " Government spoResmen have asserted , however , that the Nasser regime would make no final decision on President Eisenhower 's program until it had received clarifications to a number of questions the Egyptians* have raised regarding it . The Cairo press has said the four Arab leaders would discuss three main topics : Washington 's Middle East plan , joint Arab attitude toward Israel 's delay in withdrawing behind the Egyptian-Israeli armistice lines and a financial subsidy to Jordan by Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Syria to replace that now supplied by Britain . The most pressing by far appears to be the subject of United States intentions In the Middle East . Unofficially , Egyptian political circles have expressed more and more , openly their fears that President Eisen-. hov ; er 's program may be aimed at isolating President Nasser and wooing other Arab states into closer ties with the West . Strong Plea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a state visit to Washington , and since his kingdom is entirely dependent upon the royalties it receives from United States oil interests , it is being assumed here that President Nasser will make his strongest approach to the Saudi Arabian monarch . President Nasser certainly would not want King Saud to abandon the loosely knit Arab neutralist bloc , which has allied Egypt , Syria and Saudi Arabia against the pro-Western Baghdad Pact , the members of which are - Iraq , Iran , Turkey , Pakistan and Britain . Of major interest to King , Hussein is the proposed Arab ! subsidy by these three allies.I Strangely - enough this offer by Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Syria , now almost a year old , has the kind of political strings attached to it that President Nasser has ' so vigorously opposed in his dealings with the West . The three allies want to commit King Hussein to complete severance of friendly ties with Britain and to a pledge never to join the Baghdad Pact . Suleiman Nabulsi , Jordan 's Premier , came to power last October on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end the treaty with Britain whereby the British pay a total of about ? 12,000,000 $33,600,000 annually to bolster Jordan 's economy and keep the Army going . An Associated Press dis- I patch from Cairo quoted an informed source as having said Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Syria had agreed to pay Jordan ? 12,500,000 a year to replace the British subsidy . The Israeli Withdrawal On the question of Israeli withdrawal from Sinai , Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia have a joint vital interest . Israel has refused to hand back to Egypt a section of the desert peninsula guarding the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba at the Strait of Tiran . Until Israel took over Sinai from Egypt following the attack of Oct. 29 , Egypt had been able to maintain an effective blockade of Israeli shipping through the Gulf of Aqaba . President Nasser met King Saud at the airport in the morning and drove with him in an open car to . Kubbeh Palace . From there the two Arab leaders drove through cheering throngs to the ancient Al Azhar Mosque for Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport to meet King Hussein and Premier Nabulsi . Once again there were thousands lining the streets to cheer and applaud .
