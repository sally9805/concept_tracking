txt Unlike Bill Veeck , who had failed to effect an American League transfer of his Brownsi from St. Louis to Baltimore two days ago , Lou Perini succeeded today in shifting his National League baseball franchise from Boston to Milwaukee . After a meeting of senior circuit club owners , Warren Giles , the league president , announced the unanimous approval of Perini 's plan . Although the discussions lasted three and a half hours , Giles said " there was no real opposition " to the first shift of a major-league baseball franchise in half a century . Minor details , including the rescheduling of night games , remain ; but the package was wrapped , sealed and delivered to Perini . To gain his point , the contractorsportsman , a native New Englander , had to receive all eight votes of the National League club owners . One negative ballot would have brought rejection , but once Walter O'Malley of the Dodgers had moved for approval of the Braves ' transfer- and Horace Stoneham of the Giants had seconded the motion , every hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open vote . It then became necessary to satisfy and compensate the American Association , the Triple-A minor league in which the Milwaukee Brewers had been playing and from which they would have to be moved . Perini convinced the association 's leaders that Toledo , Ohio , an " open city , " was ready to welcome the Milwaukee club , which he owns , in the same association , and agreed to pay the group $50,000 . The vote to accept Perini 's proposition was 7-1 in favor of the move . Only Kansas City , the Yankees ' farm , voted " no . " At 2:39 P. M. , Giles emerged from the meeting room with the following announcement : " The National League has unanimously approved the transfer of the Boston franchise to Milwaukee on condition that the American Association takes the necessary steps , so that the move can be made . " Within a half hour , the " necessary steps " were taken and for the first time since 1901 , when the Red Sox set up American League business at the Hub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , along with the Cubs , are uninterrupted charter members of the National League , had been there since 1876 . For five years prior Ito 13761 Boston had been in the National Association of Professional Baseball Clubs . The nickname of the team will continue to be the " Braves . " However , it no longer will be an Eastern outfit . It was agreed that Pittsburgh would hereafter be in the Eastern Division , while Milwaukee would be in the Western Division . Each will absorb the other 's original schedule , with only the night game dates to be shuffled . Thus , opening day , April 13 , will find Milwaukee at Cincinnati and on the ? following afternoon it will be Pittsburgh at Brooklyn , Fine Standing ' Held Factor Some observers thought Perini 's success was almost as great a surprise as was Veeck 's failure . It had been felt that the American League had set the precedent at I Tampa Monday , when the Drowns ' plea was turned down . But Perini never lost confidence and Giles later declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league was a great factor . " The president conceded that questions were asked , but these mostly concerned schedules , commitments and other minor matters . 4These were answered most satisfactorily by Perini , " Giles said . " He has received written releases from radio and television contracts and all is cleared . It is a good move for our league to go into as thriving a Midwestern city as Milwaukee . We wanted to do what Perini wanted to do . The time elei:aent is inconvenient , but if it 's right , it 's right . " At Milwaukee , the Braves ' new home will be in County Stadium , a $5,000,000 structure that at the moment has 28,011 grandstand seats and 7,900 bleachers . According to 1950 census figures , Milwaukee has a total population of 871,047 in its metropolitan district , with 637,392 in the city area . However , there is a potential of 1,500,000 fans within a radius of a hundred miles . Perini expressed appreciation for the " vote of confidence " - extended to him by the National League and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active control of the Braves at Boston in 1945 and in 1948 , the year his club won the pennant , 11,455,439 fans saw the home games . Last year , though , the fans did not support the Braves , who finished seventh , and attracted only 281,000 . It was said that Perini had lost more than $700,000 in 1952 . That financial loss , however , was not the motivating factor in Perini 's decision to move . " I definitely feel that since the advent of television Boston has become a one-team city , " Perini said , " and the enthusiasm of the fans for the Boston National League club has waned . The interests of baseball can best be served elsewhere and Milwaukee has shown tremendous enthusiasm . " He said that he had foreseen the trend of transferring franchises and that " other cities can take a page from the Milwaukee book by providing for major-league facilities . " Perini said " naturally , I regret having to disappoint a great many New England fans and apologize for discommoding so many members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the baseball men present , including Bill Dewitt , vice president of the Browns . O'Malley said he was " dubious at first , but I have high regard for Perini 's judgment and went with him . " Stoneham said , " r was with him all the way . " Gabe Paul , the vice president of the Reds , also voiced confidence in Perini . The all-star game , listed for July 14 at Braves ' Field , twill be played at Crosley Field , Cincinnati , on the ' same date . Cincinnati 's turn would have come in 1954 , but today 's action moved the Ohio city up . The game was last played there in 1938 . The American Association had gone into session this morning before the National League owners assembled . At the request of Giles the minors group recessed until the completion of the big league 's session . Then the association members completed their business . Branch Rickey , who flew here from Havana , where his Pirates are training , agreed to absorb the original Boston schedule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dodgers , Giants and Phillies . Before today the last chute in the major-league map occurred in 1903 , when the Baltimore Orioles became the New York Highlanders , now the Yankees . In 1902 Milwaukee , then in the American League , became the St. Louis Browns , and in 1898 Louisville moved to Pittsburgh . Braves Field to Be Sold Braves ' Field will be sold as real estate or to a college or high school . . ? . The ball park at Milwaukee is two miles from the center of the town . . . . According to a survey , some 200,000 Wisconsin fans went to Chicago to watch the Cubs and White Sox play . .. The Brewers drew only 195,000 persons last year , while winning the Amerjean Association pennant . . . . Perini said it will take 1,000,000 paid attendances to break even this year . . . Tommy Holmes will continue as manager of the Brewers , but it is likely that they will be called the " Braves " at Toledo . The hotel in which today 's meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost his job as commissioner and the Football Rules Committee killed the twoplatoon system . Said one ? disappointed Boston writer , unhappy over the switch , " This is n't a hotel ? it 's a funeral parlor. "
