txt Massachusetts legislators are aiming to wind up their 1956 session late tonight or early tomorrow morning , eager to get to the business of electioneering either for new terms or for political promotion . Whether their goal will be reached depends on their ability to avoid or eliminate last-minute tangles on major legislation still pending . But ' with the election only a little more than four weeks away , every day spent on Beacon Hill now will hurt the political prospects of many of the members engaged in close contests . Several key issues remain to be declared . They include reorganization of the district court system , a sub-supplementary budget , liberalization of workmen 's compensation maximum benefits , a higher minimum wage , pay increases for legislators , and a $2,350,000 bond issue for repairs to Wollaston , Revere , and Winthrop beaches . Several other lesser bills are still in the legislative works . Court Reform Wait 's Whether the long battle for district court reorganization will finally end in victory this year apparently depends on a new compromise measure just emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several versions of reorganization legislation based on the celebrated Judicial Survey Commission report recommending broad court reform . Several reforms already have been adopted by the 1956 session . Only the district court issue remains on the docket for 1956 decision . Under the new compromise , 29 present part-time courts would be made full time , each with a full-time judge paid $12,000 a year and barred from private law practice . At present there are seven full-time district courts with 11 full-time judges . Originally the Judicial Survey= Commission recommended ' 22 additional full-time courts . The Legislative Committee on the Judiciary added two more courts and the Senate upped the total by three , to make the total 32 . Clerks ' Salary . Debated However , the conference committee has proposed dropping the Senate addition of three courts . Thus the Ayer , Peabody , and Newton district courts would remain part-time instead of becoming full-time as the Senate voted . The conference committee went along with the House in refusing to agree to a second full-time judge in the Malden district court . But probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one under which saiary increases for clerks of the courts would be limited to 20 per cent except in Suffolk County district courts . Traditionally the clerks have been paid at the rate of 75 per cent of the presiding judges . However , continuation of the 75 per cent rate would make many clerks eligible for gigantic salary . increases , out of proportion to their duties . In Suffolk County the proposed compromise calls for the salaries of district court clerks to be upped four grade ? , except that in the Dorchester district court the raise would be three grades . In the Dorchester court the raise would amount to $756 a year ; in the other Suffolk County district courts $1,008 annually . Six-Man . Jury Test Under the compromise , a two-year test of the six-man jury trial system would be instituted in the central district court of Worcester . Originally the judiciary committee proposed trial of the system in two courts . The test period would be from July 1 , 1959 . The conference committee went along with the House in setting the per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full-time courts , at the regular per diem rate of the presiding justice . At present the rate is $14 ' , although legislation is now in the works to change the general special justice rate to $25 a day . Under the conference committee recommendation the pay for special justices sitting in full-time courts would be boosted to $90 a day . The sub-supplementary budget may reach as much as 12 million dollars inasmuch as it must provide funds for the pay raise voted by the Legislature for the 33,000 state employees . The measure is now headed-for Gov-CI:1 ' 16r Herter 's desk for signalure . In addition several other ' measures passed since the budget and supplementary budget became law earlier must be financed . Minimum Pay Sifted Already appropriations totalling $349,999,712 for the present fiscal year have been voted . Legislators are still trying to seek common ground on minimum wage legislation , Both the House and Senate are agreed on boosting the statutory rate from 90 cents to $1 an hour in intrastate industry , and boosting from 75 cents an hour to 80 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only remaining dispute is over whether or not the minimum for employees receiving tips should be raised from 55 cents to 60 cents . The Senate favors the lower figure , the House the higher .
