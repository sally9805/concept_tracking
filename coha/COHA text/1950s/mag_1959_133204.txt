The Tar Heels were slight favorites in the ACC and a sure bet for high national ranking , with 10 tall , fast , smart veterans and a number of good sophomores . Then Doug Moe , high scorer and fine rebounder , lost his battle with the books ; he will be ineligible until the second semester . And tallest regular Dick Kepley , 6 feet 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put in a cast ; he will not be available until mid-January . There remains the slick backcourt combination of York Larese and Harvey Salz , and Forward Lee Shaffer , one of the best in the league . Sophomore Jim Hudock may start until Kepley returns , and a host of reserves includes Ray Stanley , Hugh Donohue , Grey Poole , John Crotty , Lou Brown , Don Walsh and George Poteet . DUKE also has an all-veteran crew : Howard Hurt , Carroll Youngkin , John Frye , Fred Kast and Doug Kistler . There is excellent size and speed here and more in reserve , but the shooting , except for Youngkin 's , is just fair . It is not often that a new coach comes into such wealth in his first season , but Duke 's Vic Bubas , formerly assistant at N.C. State , is a lucky ( and smart ) young man . He also has a sophomore guard , Jack Mullen , good enough to start , and some veteran subs in Larry Bateman , Doug Albright and Jay Beal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other team ; just how far up will be more apparent after their opening game , when their rugged sophomore star , Len Chappell , faces Jerry Lucas and his Ohio State crew . With Chappell , Coach Bones McKinney has two tall , veteran front-liners , Dave Budd and Winston Wiggins , and last year 's fine backcourt of George Ritchie and Charles Forte . One of these two will likely go to the bench in favor of another brilliant newcomer , Billy Packer . Bones also has adequate subs in Bull Cullen , Allie Hart , Gene Compton and Frank Loeffler . The Deacons may well be the best re-bounders in the conference . It is always foolhardy to discount an N.C. STATE squad of Ev Case 's , even when it has lost four top regulars , as this one has . An excellent sophomore bunch moves up , after a 13-4 record as frosh , and there is a wealth of experienced reserve talent , plus starter Dan Englehardt . The old hands are Bob McCann , Bob DiStefano , Stan Niewierowski , Bruce Hoadley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by three likely starters : Russ Marvel , John Key and George Finnegan . A fifth team that should be in contention all the way is MARYLAND , well stocked with veterans who can run , shoot and rebound with the best . If Coach Bud Millikan decides on a third big man to go with tall , veteran starters Al Bunge and Charles McNeil , it will be either of two reserves , Bob Wilson or Bob McDonald . If he wants more outside shooting to add to Pete Krukar 's and Jerry Bechtle 's , the fifth man will be either of two fine newcomers , Bruce Kelleher or Paul Jelus . And there are still Jerry Shanahan , Ted Marshall , Steve Alpert and Dave Schroeder on the bench . Coach Bob Stevens comes to SOUTH CAROLINA after serving his apprenticeship under the shrewd Forddy Anderson at Michigan State . He will install Forddy 's so-called " continuous-motion " offense , in which players and ball keep moving in planned patterns until a scoring opportunity arises . Stevens has eight tall veterans and two especially good sophomores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mel Quick and Walt Hudson , and Bob Frantz , Larry Dial , Ron Johnson , Fred Luigs , Bury Hudson , Art Whisnant and Bud Cronin . At CLEMSON Coach Press Maravich is still looking for re-bounders and a pivotman . He has a great deal otherwise in the shooting and speed of George and Ed Krajack , Earle Maxwell , Glenn Shample , Walt Gibbons and Don Carver , and two fine newcomers , Larry Patterson and Tom Mahaffey . The team will have good floor balance and has learned Maravich 's defense lessons , but there is no substitute for a big fellow in the slot . VIRGINIA 'S Coach Bill McCann has one of the league 's best backcourtmen , Paul Adkins , and a long list of problems . He has lost nearly his whole front line , must use reserves or sophomores up there and has no size on his bench . With Adkins , John Haner is a probable starter , and McCann hopes for consistent performance from his one big man , 6-foot-8 Bob Mortell.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
