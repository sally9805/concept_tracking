I hope , dear Uncle Frank , that you and Aunt Mildred arc having a lovely time at Gulls ' Nest . lean never thank you enough for your kindness in introducing me to Tom Stanton . He now owns a quarter of the show and all of me . Your loving niece , JOAN . FROM MILDRED PEABODY TO JOAN ; My dearest , dearen niece , Just a tiny note of congratulations to you and Tom . I am strongly that I was willing to quit my job . I packed up at the end of the year to try teaching in a traditional , fee-paying school for boys of four and one half to fourteen ; for Boy , with a capital B , still has some advantage over " girl " in Britain . Upon registering with a teachers ' agency , I discovered that British schools for boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " because women are " too soft . " It was a rare bit of luck that Mr. L. C. Clifton-Everest , headmaster and owner of Winton House Preparatory School for Boys , appreciated my interest in English schooling and hired me at 430 pounds ( $1200 ) per year . Winton House was not a school for keen boys nor for dull boys  --  but for Boys . Its raison ( rare was to teach a boy to master as much academic material as he was able , to require the self-discipline which leads to the good manners and poise characteristic of a self-respecting member of society , and to open a boy 's eyes to the wonders of God 's world around him . Until we began to go over the teaching plan , however , I had n't tumbled to the fact that I would not teach English only , as I had done in my American school , but whatever the headmaster directed me to teach . This included Bible , Latin , art , English , Shakespeare , " crahfts , " nature and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights and meas-ures ! You know , " I ventured , " I 've always been something of a mathematical cripple , and I 'm not confident about dealing with the currency . It 's the multiplication and division that baffle me . " " I suppose they might , " he returned , quite unruffled and not a little amused , " but , of course , you must do it . I 'll teach you one day after tea , " he added with what I felt was misplaced confidence in my ability and his , I was wrong . In an hour this outstandingly competent teacher taught me to multiply and divide pounds , shillings , pence and farthings . He took it for granted that one did not let the side down ; I had n't been so pleased since I learned to swim . Winton House School 's 140 boys arrived at the three-story , yellow brick building at quarter of nine each morning . Boys , masters and mistresses descended outside stairs to a basement-level floor where the boys ' dressing rooms , kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uniformed in gray shirt and short gray trousers , purple jacket , purple-and-black tie , purple-topped gray socks and wee purple cap , each boy removed his cap instantly he came through the door and proceeded to the row of pegs which lined the hallway wall . After removing wet outdoor shoes , he put on sandals from the shoe bag hanging from its peg . Into the so happy in all your success . Tom is such a sweet boy , although I feel it was a little naughty of him to put his money into your play instead of Frank 's . Now about your uncle . Although he is almost recovered from his breakdown , he is still not quite himself . The doctor says he will be all right ; it is just a matter of time . But if I may make a little joke , he is beginning to growl again , which shows he is getting back to normal . Well . li has been quite a summer , has n't it ? Your fond aunt MILDRED , bag went outdoor shoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where a pathway skirting the garden led to the gym . Master Four-and-One-Half arrived as a new boy whose mum or nannie helped with his change of shoes . The miniature manliness of his uniform was somewhat lessened by the quivering of his lower lip as he clung to mum or even shed a few tears . With an understanding smile , Mr. Everest would say , " Crying , Hawkins ? Why , all boys here are happy , and you will be happy too . Be a sensible Boy . Good morning , Mrs. Hawkins , " thus dismissing her , and , " Coningsby , " to an old boy of seven , " will you take Hawkins down to prayers ? " Mrs. Hawkins played her part in starting her son along the path to manhood . " Bye-bye , dear , " she would say with too bright a smile , " I shall fetch you at noon . " Evidences of economy in the boys ' dress  --  the elbow patches , nicely damed socks and turned collars  --  made me wonder why parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons in state-supported schools . When I found that only three mothers out of twenty-one owned refrigerators , I realized that early education was important to these parents . It meant so much that when the headmaster advised one mother , who was working to keep her son at school , that the school could do little for her boy in an academic way , she asked that he be retained so that through association he might acquire the behavior and attitudes which she felt would greatly help him in later life . The boy stayed . The others accepted him as he was , and I watched him accept his limitations at the age of ten and adjust beautifully , though he was the largest boy in the form . No stigma of failure attached to this lad ; he was simply a fine boy who could not learn . The twig which is bent early may possibly break less readily under strain . However noisy the gym might have been prior to the headmaster 's entrance for prayers , even smallest boys in the front row stood at attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good morning , boys , " and their response , " Good morning , sir , " After Bible reading , recitation of the Lord 's Prayer and the singing of two hymns , we sat in a row behind the headmaster , awaiting his remarks . The boys stood through prayers ; no chairs were provided for them . " From my study window yesterday afternoon , " he stated on one occasion , " I saw a Winton House Boy speak to a lady without raising his cap . If this should happen again , I shall deal with that boy . " Silence ; each boy fancied himself guilty . and I learned that uniforming provided a means of quick and accurate identification for the headmaster and his staff . In April 1- , WIRE WRESTLER SOCKET SNEAK . addition , it was a source of pride to the boys ; it gave them a sense of belonging , of rightness and of security . Older boys collected hymnbooks and returned the staff 's chairs to the dining room while we dispersed to the classrooms . Mine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . From the center of the ceiling a single , unshaded , lonely electric-light bulb dangled from its wire . One piece of blackboard rested on the mantelpiece over the fireplace behind my desk ; another threeby-live-foot piece stood on an easel in the corner . The fireplace opening contained a fool-square gas unit , Twenty-one boys , from a very capable seven to a rather slow ten , occupied double benches deeply scarred in educational battles of years gone by . Benches attached to the desks had to be folded upward when an occupant arose . It was obvious that when Rogers stood to recite , Danks would rise , too , or be folded , knees to chest , against the back of the bench . I was alone in the belief that this was rather inconvenient . At my entrance every boy stood as had expected , but I did n't know the formula for getting them to sit down . Mr. Everest 's entrance saved the day . " Sit down , boys , " he said automatically , hardly aware of them , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman 's final decision is not necessarily the same as the one she makes later . H. N. FERGUSON desk drawers . I shall bring the ink round when I have made it , " and he strode out . Ink for arithmetic ? I visualized twenty-one pairs of inky paws and wondered vaguely whether there was a mop handy . Form Four , fascinated at having an American mistress , promptly ferreted out limp , paper-bound arithmetic books and copybooks ruled in quarter-inch squares . Each square was to contain not more than one figure to insure neatness . Each page was folded vertically so that there would be no waste in working sums from top to bottom of the half page . I wrote an example on the board . Up rose a thicket of hands . " Please , sir , " said one , and all the boys giggled , " we 've no pens or nibs . " A drawer yielded both , and after nibs had been properly licked and inserted into well-worn penholders , we seemed ready to start , except that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Form Five , suddenly handed through the door an orange teapot . This proved to be an ideal pouring device , though it did seem a near sacrilege to use a teapot to dole out ink . Having done the examples the night before as I was to do all year long , I sidled through the narrow aisles checking the boys ' work . Blotting paper was not available , for it always gravitated to the inkwells , nor were there erasers . " We do n't use rubbers , " explained Field ; " we make a diagonal line through an error , so that you may see how it happened . " The whole term 's work was done in a copybook which could be scrutinized by headmaster or parents in its entirety at any time . Untidy work was considered " shocking , " and such sums were reworked . Discipline was handled almost entirely by the headmaster . Boys were expected to apply themselves , to avoid being cheeky ( saucy ) or smarmy ( ingratiating ) , and to be honorable , gentlemanly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Form Five with Latin grammar that I inadvertently called down upon the seal of hapless Cunningham the wrath of the headmaster and learned that he and only he wielded the cane . Cunningham , aged ten and our best cricketer , had not set to work . Asked what he was doing , he answered honestly enough , " Nothing . " I recommended that he stand in the hall until he felt ready to work . Not two minutes later I heard Mr. Everest 's voice . Then their footsteps descended the stairs to the study , where , I learned , the headmaster customarily meted out the school 's traditional form of discipline , caning . Shortly after , Cunningham , having taken his licks , re-turned to form to work . Stubbs really wrote his own ticket to the study . Seated in the front row , dangling slender legs , feet nowhere near the floor , looking up out of dark-fringed almost violet eyes , eight-year-old Stubbs told so obvious a fib that other boys gasped and stared . I sent him to the study . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more to himself than to me , " but he should n't have done it . " Ail boys bent to their work , nor did they look up when the culprit returned . Genuinely fond of Mr. Everest , the boys admired and respected him , offered him sweets , willingly ran all sorts of errands . He tweaked their ears in passing , made jokes about their names and admonished them to be sensible . He reiterated that he expected each boy to do his best and that no one could do more . Caning broke no spirits at Winton House . The boys were normally noisy , active , silly , inventive , and responsive when dismissed to swarm over the play yard , where they acquired the overlay of dirt which boys are expected to acquire . As the year progressed , I began to understand why it is impossible to equate the English system of moving boys from form to form with the American progression from grade to grade . Progression through forms depends on the ability of the individual ; the advance from grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than on his ability . This difference in system has its greatest effect in the case of the academically gifted student . Barnes was an example of what can happen under the English system . One September he had entered the kindergarten , taught by a Froebel-trained mistress , and had enjoyed painting , growing water cress on damp blotting paper and imitating older boys . He liked to form letters and numbers and made good progress . After the Easter holidays , when he had spent two terms in the half-day kindergarten , he was " moved up " to Form One . Here the boys were reading , and Barnes had been moved into the group with the expectation that his interest and ability would enable him to learn to read quickly and that he would gradually work up to the level of Form One . No effort was made to accelerate Barnes . He was simply exposed to reading and arithmetic that he had not encountered before . During this third term , lasting until the end of July , Barnes listened to others read and watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who encouraged and helped him . His report stated the average age of boys in his group and Barnes ' age . Teacher comment on his work was favorable in a restrained English way , because Barnes was the youngest boy in the form . His accomplishment was measured against that of each boy in Form One . Placement was determined by averagingeach boy 's grades . Barnes had done well to stand seventeenth boy out of twenty-one . Starting the Michaelmas term the following September , Barnes continued to ( - : . 168 THE SATURDAY F.YeNING P learn to read , write and figure in Form One He prog re ti rapidly , and his term 's report showed that he then stood eighth out of twenty-one . He was controlling his writing , reading well and doing his sums accurately . Listening to members of the group read aloud and with expression , he had blotted up a large vocabulary . Hearing corrections of mistakes in pronunciation made by inept readers , Barnes had increased his feeling for odd words and syllabication , but he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Easter term , from Christmas holiday to Easter , Barnes improved as the group undertook more difficult work . Dictation was started , which meant that the teacher would write on the blackboard a sentence taken from the reading . This sentence was chosen for new words , the troublesome word spcllingwise , or sometimes for punctuation . Armed with a stubby pencil whose dull point had been encouraged with a knife in the absence of pencil sharpeners , Barnes copied this sentence into a small notebook , had it corrected and took it home to memorize . Later in the week the sentence was dictated , and each boy was marked on the correctness of capitalization , spelling and punctuation . From this practice Barnes gradually developed a sentence sense , in that his capitals and punctuation tended to appear in the right places , and his spelling was accurate . At the end of term it was decided that the two boys who were top of the form should " go up " to Form Two . Barnes had spent three terms in Form One , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a year . When Barnes entered my form , he had been advanced two thirds of a year . Specifically , he had remained two terms only in each of two forms , whereas the average boy might be expected to remain in each form for three terms . Barnes was high-strung and enthusiastic ; he was carefully watched to see that he was not advancing beyond the limit of his capability . The boys sailed through weights and measures , and 1 nearly laughed aloud at Tyler 's earnest recitation of the table of liquid measurement . " Forty ounces make one quart , " he finished , and I could n't help thinking how like Alice in Wonderland it all was : I knew a quart contained thirty-two ounces ! Hundredweights , guarters , rods , perches and poles ! Boys figured them all in their stride while I recalled the days when I had assumed that perches had only to do with fish or bird-cage equipment . The boys ' attitude toward Barnes ' leaving their form was one of indulgent affection . " Good old Barnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , you 'll be along soon , you know , " he replied , squirming with embarrassment at having been singled out for comment . " He 'll only be going across the hall , " remarked the slowest boy . " That 's right , " agreed Barnes , relieved to have attention drawn elsewhere . " Would anyone like a sweet ? " he asked as a further diversion . I had looked forward to English with Form Three . Teaching English was my dish of tea , so to speak , and I should n't have to consult books at the public library about it as I did for my nature class . ( A shrew is the smallest wild animal in Britain . It is a mouselikc creature with a piglike snout . ) We embarked on a writing project ; each boy was to write a piece about himself . " This sentence , " I explained glibly , " needs to end with a period . " My remark produced twenty-one blank stares , and I knew that my mental arrow had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hargrave , cad your second sentence , with punctuation , " I suggested . " My home is located al I13 comma Seidel ) Lane comma Beckenham comma Kent full stop , " he finished . " Thank you . Hargrave , " I answered . In this fashion I translated part of my Americanese into British English . The last such translation occurred when my American quotation marks turned into British " inverted commas . " " Good ! " signified little at the close of a perfect recitation , and the recipient of such a comment looked so let down that before long I heard my own voice saying , " Well done , " or , " Exactly . " That voice also said on occasion . " That 's very silly of you , " and , " Do be sensible . " That a Form might have several periods of reading in one day owing to some vagaries of schedule was considered all to the good , and it was a joy to the readers . Reading chosen to enlarge vocahula and to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kingsley 's The Water B bies , which they pleaded to read aloud second time . The Trojan Boy , a story of lad who lived through the storming ci Troy , fascinated another group while gave them a working knowledge of m ology . Scott 's The Talisman , Swi Family Robinson , and a story about the settlement of Canada occupied Form Four . Form Five boys of ten and eleven approached beginning Latin with eagerness . It seemed to be a privilege to study Latin though they had started French conversation and vocabulary the year before . Curiously enough , they appeared to enjoy it whether they earned good marks or not . After two terms , using an American textbook , my two best boys moved into Mr. Everest 's Form Six . They and 1 were elated to find that they were able to keep up quite well . Mr. Everest 's only comment about my teaching was a result of my not requiring enough of Form Five boys who were reading As You Like It and of Form Six boys who were studying Julius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Form Five was at last able to write about the seven ages of man , with punctuation , and Form Six boys had memorized and recited thirty lines apiece . I should have realized that they could do this easily , for they had been memorizing factual material ever since dictation in Form One . Their minds were trained to do it , and this ability was of practical value to them in building extensive vocabularies in English , French and Latin . Although the Welsh master held physical-training classes involving various calisthenics , Tuesday afternoons were devoted to games . It was suggested that I take members of Forms One and Two to the Cricket Club . some distance away , to play association football . Over my protestation that I did n't even know the game , the headmaster laughed and said I should " have a go at it . " It turned out to be soccer of a most informal sort about which the boys knew a good bit , so we got on famously . Boys formed a " crocodile , " a straggly double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unheated clubhouse , where a change of dress was in order . Once attired in shorts and flimsy shirt , each boy brought me a pair of football boots with extravagantly long and tangled shoe lacings , with the polite request that I help him with his boots . Having coped with about twenty pairs , I called for assistance from older boys and made strong recommendations to the effect that mum or dad could help prevent this delay of the games period . With teams chosen , we ran briskly out on the field , being very careful not to cross the cricket pitch . The boys lined themselves up properly ; I blew my whistle and tossed the ball between the lines . As there was more than double the number of players usually taking part in this fracas , I am sure that I managed the liveliest association-football game in England . When the players began to weary and my watch indicated that our time was spent , we repaired to the clubhouse , where I assisted in the removal of football boots whose wet and knotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My teeth chattered to watch their chilly change of clothing , and I was most chagrined on one occasion to discover that , with all boys dressed , there was one undershirt left over . I peered down many backs before 1 found the silly boy who had n't his undershirt ; he carried it home in his book bag .

Form Four clusweed before the gas lire to warns their hands , but soon went to their desks . Because age and the bombings of World War II had thrown many buildings out of line , the windows could not be made to fit snugly .

Encased in layers of woolen unthinkables , the like of which I had not worn since I was twelve , and wearing heavy boots , I became extremely proficient at finding my place in a thin-leaved hymnbook without removing my gloves . Late spring brought the blossoming glory of nature 's apology for the bitterness of winter , as well as cricket hats , balls and boots , It also brought examinations which older buys " sat " in the hope of gaining admission to state-supported grammar schools , where boys might study for entrance to a university .

Like the boys , I had been " moved up , " experiencing with them the early start of training in our language . Extended to me were the patience and kindly understanding of the headmaster and every member of his staff . Now I 'm teaching at the Litchfield , Connecticut . high school . But outstanding in my memory of Winton House is the realistic approach to problems great and small , such as the time when a group of boys bore down upon the master in charge of the play yard . In their midst was a small boy with a cut knee . " Oh , look , sir ! " they cried . " He 's bleeding ! " " That 's what he 's expected to do when he 's cut , is n't it ? " returned the master
