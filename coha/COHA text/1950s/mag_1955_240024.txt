MY PHILADELPHIA FATHER ( 256 pp. ) - Cordelia Drexel Biddle , as told to Kyle Crichfon-Doubleday ( $4 ) . <P> When Edward VII toured the U.S. in 1860 as Prince of Wales , something about Philadelphia especially impressed him . " In Philadelphia , " he is reported to have said , " I met a large and interesting family named Scrapple , and discovered a rather delicious native food they call biddle . " <P> In this uproarious memoir Cordelia Drexel Biddle ( now Mrs. T. Markoe Robertson ) serves up a Philadelphia pepper pot of stories about the Main Line 's celebrated Biddies . Most of the book is about her father . Colonel Anthony J. Drexel Biddle , a punch-and-judo-throwing millionaire who led fully as strenuous a life as his good friend Teddy Roosevelt . As an amateur boxer , the bald , spike-mustached aristocrat fought under the name of " Tim O'Biddle . " The great Ruby Bob Fitzsimmons called him one of the best amateur fighters he ever saw . In 1908 he went four roughhouse rounds with Philadelphia Jack O'Brien . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , started a movement called Athletic Christianity that soon won some 200,000 followers around the world . Mixing Bible lessons with boxing bouts , Biddle would tell his young disciples : " I want you boys to go in there and fight as if Christ were the referee . " <P> Probable Baritone . When World War I threatened , Biddle set up camp on a family estate and trained 40,000 men for U.S. fighting forces . One young marine boot named Gene Tunney took his first boxing lessons from Biddle . Later , the athletic Christian circled the world to find more punishing combat tricks to teach marine and FBI recruits . He also found time to write a dozen books ( " in a rather half-nelson style , " says his daughter ) and give annual recitals at Philadelphia 's august Academy of Music . ( " Mr. Biddle is a baritone , I think , " said one critic . ) <P> When World War II broke out , the colonel , then 67 , was called back to help harden marines . " Come on , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they brandished their bayonets . " Why , " said one recruit flattened by the colonel 's jujitsu , " that old geezer knows more ways to kill you with his bare hands than any man alive . " <P> Complete Man . By the time Anthony Biddle died ( in 1948 at 73 ) , he had seen his son and ring protg Tony become an ambassador and a colonel . His grandson , Cordelia 's boy " Angie " Biddle Duke , later served as Truman 's envoy to El Salvador , the youngest ambassador in U.S. history ( 36 when he was appointed ) . Though Biddies still proliferate in Philadelphia 's social register , Cordelia has switched from the Main Line to Manhattan . The result is that My Philadelphia Father , " as told to " Kyle Crichton , * reads like ripsnorting , Bull Moosish commotion recollected in the comparative tranquillity of a Park Avenue penthouse party . <P> Though there are glimpses of the many-mansioned world in which Cordelia grew up , the ponderous , plunging figure of the colonel dominates the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter . " At any time in his life one could point to him and say , ' There is a complete man . ' " <P> * Onetime ( pre-1940 ) staffer on the Communist New Masses ( under the nom de guerre of Robert Forsythe ) and slick-magazine writer who turned to biography ( The Marx Brothers ) .
