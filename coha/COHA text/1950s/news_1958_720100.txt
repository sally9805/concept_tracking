txt Because colleges are deficit operations in which the student pays one-fifth to nearly one-half the matt of his instruction , the problem of meeting the need to double the capacity of higher education facilities in the next decade is a major national worry , The more students , the more colleges are going to cost taxpayers and the more energies college officials are going to have to devote to raising money . But an institution in a New York suburb is indicating that for growing urban communities , at least , a good liberal arts college can be provided at no cost to the taxpayers . Twenty-three-year-old Hofstra College , in Hempstead , L. I. , not only pays its own way out of student tuition , but has built 85 per cent of its $10,000,000 plant out of income , The new departures that make this possible stem from Hofstra 's , basic economy as a college for , commuter students , It has not cent invested in dormitories . It does not pretend to be a university , but concentrates on undergraduate and master 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty salaries are well above average . Its student drop-out rate is about half the national average and col-1 lege officials say the number of transfers from other institutions , 240 this year , has been rising ' steadily . Future Pattern The commuter college is bound to be the pattern of the future in the opinion of many educators . And Hofstra 's president , Dr. John C. Adams , sees no reason why the story of his institution ca n't be re- ' peated or enlarged upon in many parts of the country . Most of the nation 's population lives in cities of 10,000 or over and already 55 to 60 per cent of the country 's college population commutes rather than lives on campus . The key to solvency , Dr. Adams says , is chiefly efficient use of plant . With 8,000 students attending classes in three shifts , the college operates on a seventy-nine-hour week and its classrooms and laboratories are in use 85 per cent of the time , In the average college the week is only a little over half that of Hofstra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the time , Classes at Hofstra run from 8 A , M , to 3 P , M. , , five days a week for 2,800 day students . From 4 to 6 P. M. , another 2,000 students , mostly teachers working for master's-degrees , are in class , and from 6 to 10:30 P. M. , there are 4,20C evening students , On Saturday there are special classes from 9 A. M. to 4 P. M. Being considered are weekend courses and night summer sessions in addition to the day sessions , There is a conscious effort to see that every room is in use every period , and no department has a lease on any space . The average United States college class has fewer than ten students . At Hofstra the average is twenty-one , Any lecture class that drops below ten for three years becomes suspect , and unless it is an essential one to the curriculum , it is dropped , This , Dr , Adams said , saves space and prevents proliferation . Hofstra has an honors program , patterned after Harvard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Construction Cost A comparison with construction costs per student for other colleges reveals the economy which helps make the Hofstra-type operation possible , Because no living quarters are needed , and a studentunion cafeteria replaces costlier dining halls , Hofstra 's plant represents an investment of about $1,250 per student . In contrast , residential , dining and classroom facilities for the average large college costs $4,920 per student . For the small colleges , that do not make as furl use of buildings , the average cost is $5,920 , according to the ' United States Office of Education . Hofstra 's eighty-acre campus is laid out in three quadrangles . Dr. Adams decrees no marble , no belfries , and no bronze on the buildings , but there is gilt on the college 's new $1,200,000 playhouse and dramatic arts center . A commuter college does have one large non-teaching expense  --  parking . Hofstra has purchased a total of eight acres for 2,000 parking places , some at three dollars a square foot , . To provide more , it may double deck those areas rather than buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been increased every year . Full professors average $11 , - 000 a year , with the base at $9,400 . Associate professors average $3,500 , with a base of $7,000 , An Office of Education study reported in March that the average pay of full professors in private colleges was $7,360 , and for public colleges Student . Rating Students on the campus rated the faculty and the college superior . To faculty members questioned , Hofstra had the excitement of new ideas , and their approval and loyalty , Dr. Adams said , was attested by the fact that the college has not lost a full or associate professor in the last five or six years . About 400 graduates have scholarships costing the college $141,000 , also mostly out of income , Gifts have amounted to about $2,500,000 in twenty-three years and the endowment is small because it is harder to persuade donors to give to a self-liquidating institution , Furthermore , one-half of Hofstra 's alumni have been out of school less than five years , so they are not yet a substantial source of funds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand three branches in February , with the view to making them two-year colleges , which would provide either terminal education or funnel students on to Hofstra for the last two years . It is also planning to open next fall an experimental branch in which freshman and sophomore years will be combined and " graduates " will go to the Hempstead campus as juniors . The same opportunities are open to other urban communities that have higher education needs to meet , Dr. Adams believes . Even the original capital grant should not be a barrier , he says , both because no fixed sum is needed , and concerted action could raise the needed starting funds ,
