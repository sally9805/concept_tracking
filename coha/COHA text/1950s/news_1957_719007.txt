txt When the Administration 's budget first went to Congress last January the requested appropriation for the Defense Department was slightly more than $36 billion . And the view of the Pentagon at that time was that this was the rock-bottom figure that the military could live with . Well , just the other day the House and Senate conferees finally agreed to appropriate $33.7 billion for the Defense Department . This figure is some $197 million more than the economyminded House would have appropriated and it is $774 million less than the Senate had previously agreed to . But it is still S2.4 billion less than the military insisted it had to have . And now , lo and behold , the Defense Department has let it be known that it can , after all , " live with " the $33.7 billion . The smaller figure , it turns out , is not going to wreck our national defense program . The ' ordinary citizen , we suspect , must be somewhat puzzled to find that a reduction of more than $2 billion in the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be in January . And we think he might be pardoned for wondering now if this is n't also true of a great many other " must " items in this $72 billion budget  --  the supposedly untouchable foreign aid appropriation , for one . To be sure , not all the reductions made in these appropriations mean savings in the actual expenses for fiscal 1958 ; the military , like other Government departments , has a lot of carry-over funds that it can still spend . Nonetheless , it does mean that the Pentagon now concedes it can get along with less spending money for the future . The moral , it seems to us , is that living with economy is not so painful as it seems and that it can be done when anyone takes the pains to insist upon it .
