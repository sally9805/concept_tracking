THE REBEL EMPEROR ( 352 pp. ) - Flavia Anderson-Doubledoy ( $4.95 ) . <P> <P> Hung Hsiu-ch'uan was a kind of Chinese John Brown , a religious zealot who saw his rebellion succeed-for a time . A poor provincial schoolteacher , he rose to lead the Taiping Rebellion , which ravaged China between 1851 and 1864 , and cost the lives of an estimated 20 million people . Since Hung was a professing if distinctly unorthodox Christian , who ruled some 30 million subjects at the peak of his power , he has left behind him one of the most tantalizing ifs in history : If he had toppled the Manchu Dynasty and mounted the Dragon Throne , would China be Christian today ? <P> Around this intrinsically fascinating story , Author Flavia Anderson has wrapped the bulky burlap of 50-odd volumes of research . Clich-laden and crammed with minor figures , the book has a narrative pace roughly that of a Yangtze barge hauled upstream . But it is a historical trip worth taking for readers who can match Author Anderson 's labor of love with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canton , Hung Hsiu-ch'uan ( " The Accomplished and Perfected ' ' ) at first longed to be a civil servant . Disheartened at flunking exams , and already possessed of fragments of Christianity , he fell ill and went into a 40-day trance . During the trance , he saw visions , and later declared that he had talked with God and been ordained to rule China . Hung threw the graven tablet commemorating Confucius out of his classroom . The act brought immediate dismissal as a teacher . After Hung converted his best friend , the pair began proselytizing in Kwangsi province . <P> Most of the converts were Hakkas , members of an outsider ethnic group to which Hung himself belonged . Social scientists might call them havenots ; Toynbee would call them an internal proletariat . What with famine poverty , and the corruption of the Manchus , the Hakkas were ripe for revolt . <P> In 1851 an army of 40,000 " God-worshipers , " as they called themselves , began a march on Peking from about 300 miles west of Canton . They wore their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as marks of Manchu enslavement , and took spirited noms de guerre- " Enemy-Breaking , " " Rush on Foe , " " Report Success . " " God is the father of the generals of this army , " Hung told his men . The God-worshipers swarmed down the Yangtze River valley and into Nanking , covering 1,400 miles in 27 months . <P> Calvin plus Savonarola . There Hung set up regal headquarters and proclaimed : " The New Jerusalem ft the present Nanking . " The advance guard of his army rolled to within 100 miles of Peking but never captured the Manchu capital . For the next eleven years Hung 's Nanking was ruled with the puritanical fanaticism of Calvin 's Geneva and Savonarola 's Florence . The decapitated heads of the Decalogue-breakers hung above the city 's gates . Adulterers were wrapped in oil-soaked cloth , and set aflame . Hung himself maintained a harem that grew to 88 wives and concubines , but defended it as a dynastic necessity .                @ @ @ @ @
