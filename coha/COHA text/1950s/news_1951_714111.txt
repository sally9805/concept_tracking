txt Prof. Edward S. Corwin , whose great authority in the field of constitutional law is undisputed , not only concurred but supplied further arguments for the constitutionality of such an amendment , Our test of justice is fairness , expressed in terms of ex post facto and due process . I do n't believe that such an amendment would ' violate our feeling of justice . ? Last year Congress pronounced- the continuation of military jurisdiction after separation from service : in the absence of civil jurisdiction as a principle . By the proposed amendment , Congress would only follow the lead- ; . ing precedents of the above-mentioned cases . The facts in the Holohan murder make a much stronger case for a Congressional amendment . ARTHUR LENHOPF . Buffalo , N.Y. , Sept. 7 , 1951 . Goodwill Visit of Merchants Believed to Presage Closer Cooperation To THE EDITOR OrTHE NEW YORK Tams : Your issue of Aug. 31 ' carried the announcement of a " goodwill " visit that approximately fifty Scandinavian retail merchants will make to this country in January , 1953 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in Sweden , Norway , Denmark and Finland , some of your readers may be interested in receiving a few first-hand impressions regarding conditions in these countries . Of the four countries that I visited , Finland proved to be the most surprising . I had been led to believe that Finland was virtually behind the Iron Curtain . Nothing could be further from the truth . I saw More Americans in Helsinki than I saw Russians . I found a free press , which was willing to print anything I cared to say , and a free radio system over which I made a nation-wide uncensored broadcast . Of the four countries , Sweden is in the best shape , from an economic standpoint . The index of its volume of industrial production ( 1938=100 ) has increased from 140 in 1947 to 162 in 1950 . There has also been an annual increase in productivity of about 5 per cent in the post-war period . Sweden has ' also made great progress toward closing ' the gap between imports from gild exports to the . United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 160,000,000 kronor , while for the whole year of 1950 it amounted to 192,000,000 kronor . Sweden has received ? o grants from our E. C. A. All the assistance she now receives is in the form of an interest-bearing loan of ' approximately $120,000,000 . Aid Received As to the other Scandinavian countries , Denmark has received approximately $250 ; 000,000 in grants and about $30,000,000 in loans .. Norway has received about $225,000,000 in grants and about ; 35,000,000 in loans . Finland has received no E. C. A. aid : whatsoever . All four countries are tackling their economic problems realistically and with full confidence in the future . Communism is at a mery low ebb . Its existence is primarily underground . During recent years , when improved methods of ' transportation and communication have made the entire ? world seem small , the Scandinavian countries ' have acquired a new *and vital importance for the United States . Norway , Denmark and Sweden are now the keys to the control of the North Atlantic Ocean . They are also Europe 's gateway to the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these days of atomic fission , that area may serve as the scene of the future struggle , for survival between the East and the West . Norway and Denmark are members , along with the United States , of the Atlantic Defense Pact . Norway , like . Finland , has a common frontier with Soviet Russia . It is generally believed that Stalin plans , as Hitler did , to use the deep fjords of Norway as sub- ; marine bases , if and when war should come . Need for Understanding There are , however , additional and urgent reasons why close cooperation and improved understanding between our country and the Scandinavian countries has become very necessary . First , there . are many millions of American citizens who are of Scandinavian origin . They are among our best citizens . Second , there is a growing need for all the free countries of the world to find markets for their products and products for their markets . American retailers , generally speaking , are quite happy about the economic cooperation that has been extended to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marshall Plan . We believe , however , that Government action was only the begin . ping . We further believe in economic cooperation at . the bushiesi ' level  --  between trade groups , labor unions , farm groups and individuals . In that way ; perhaps , the free peoples of the . world may succeed , where the diplomats and the warriors have failed , in ultimately achieving world ' peace and economic stability . The " goodwill " group will be the gktests of honor at the forty-second annual convention of the National Retail Dry Goods Association . Following this the delegation will visit several leading American cities . It is our hope and belief that this visit , along with those that are being scheduled from other countries , will make a substantial contribution to the development of that friendship , under - ' standing and improved trade relations upon which the future of the world so largely depends . . BENJAMIN H. NAMM . Brooklyn , Sept. 4 , 1951 . Amendment Favored To THE EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK TIMES : May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your issue of . Sept. 7 . He appears to have missed the point completely . There is no word in. my letter of Aug. 26 from ' which a , reader could infer that Article 3 of the Code of Military Justice of 1950 , which provides for the continuation of military justice , , under stated conditions , after separation from the service , has a retroactive effect . It is self-evident that no court-martial could be set up in the Holohan case under the authority of the military code as it stands . In basing his letter on the fact that.trying the accused Americans under the ' , resent . provisions would be illegal , Mr. Weis is obviously only affirming the reason for my . suggestion of ' an amendment . It was the question of . the constitutionality of ' an amendment which my letter . put squarely before the reader . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE : Park Avenue from the Grand Cen ? tral Station to Sixtieth Street has for a generation been one of this city 's most distinguished streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty-seventh Street and of Fifty-ninth Street , and the Lever Building going up between Fifty-third and Fifty-fourth Streets , a survey of this , section of the avenue a year ago showed a residential occupancy of 80 per cent . At that time I urged the ' City Planning Commission to save the character of the street by zoning it as " local retail , " which permits business at the street level but restricts to residential occupancy the stories above . Their attention was called to the history of the changes in the location of New York 's luxury shopping district  --  and to the danger that if this part of Park Avenue should be , given over to commercial buildings , of the eventual deterioration of the corresponding blocks on Fifth Avenue and the ultimate departure to some new location more nearly adjacent to the city 's social residential center of its great shops . To , one with an affection for New York City and confidence in the protective power of zoning in the maintenance of its character and values it is with a heavy heart that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced removal of the Duveen Galleries from their present distinguished building at Fifty-sixth Street and Fifth Avenue to East Seventy-ninth Street . If the will were there , Park Avenue could yet be saved . But it would take drastic action to do so . Its great luxury apartment buildings should be removed , by special legislation if necessary , front the unreasonable , uneconomic rent control . This has scant justification in these buildings and has completely wrecked them as real estate investments . These buildings should once more . be permitted to charge sensible and appropriate rents . The avenue from Forty-seventh Street north should immediately be placed , as it should have been long ago , in a " local retail zone . " Even with the utterly incongruous Lever Building at Fifty-third and Fifty-fourth Streets , the dignified character of the avenue with its great hotels , apartments , the Racquet Club and St. Bartholomew 's Church would be largely preserved and the deterioration of Fifth Avenue indefinitely . postponed .

The piggy bank has long been the symbol of thrift , honesty and hard work ; and because of this , it is to be found full  --  full of bright and dull , shiny , and worn copper pennies . You would not have us believe that money has attained such little value i that the smallest unit thereof is not worth saving . Is the.six-year-old saver of cents to understand that the proud porker bulging happily with pennies on the shelf is no longer Fort Knox and the Bank of England but only . a jug of copper disks ?

Credit for ' Victory Over Japan To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Referring to the commendation by President Truman and Senator Know . land of Mr. Acheson 's handling of the San Francisco Conference , why can not some credit be also given from official United States Government sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys who served under him , all of whom made the victory and the peace treaty possible ? Credit also should be rendered to John Foster Dulles . But the most disturbing factor in the laudatory accounts of Mr. - Acheson 's diplomatic accomplishments ' for obvious partisan reasons is that the credit for the victory is taken away officially : from the heroes who alone deserve it , ARTHUR Brass LANE . Washington , Sept. 11 , 1951 . Listing of Zone Numbers Suggested To THE EDITOR OF THE Nsw YoRK TIMES : Since many persons look up addresses in the telephone directories , it seems to me that the telephone company , would be performing a wonderful public service by including the zone ' numbers in each listing . This would pro . vide a great help , to the Post Office Department , which is very under . staffed . Too , ' the general public would appreciate this i.xtra service by the phone company .
