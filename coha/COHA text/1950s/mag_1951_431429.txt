 | Many Protestant clergymen not only publicly praised this Catholic pronouncement but urged it upon the attention of their parishioners The Measure Of Man 's Conduct Excerpts from a statement issued by the Roman Catholic Bishops of the United States at their annual meeting in Washington , D. C. , November 14-16 , 1951 WE HAVE sent our young men on military expeditions to far-off lands so that justice and freedom may be kept alive in the world ; and yet at home we have become careless about the foundations of justice and the roots of freedom . It can not go well with us if we continue on this course , The Roman Empire disintegrated from within ; and moral corruption was the main cause of its decline and disappearance . That fate will befall us if we do not awaken to the danger which threatens from within our own household . Mastery over Material things will avail us nothing if we lose mastery over ourselves . Mastery over self is the primary concern of morality . Morality involves the correct and careful regulation of three relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his fellow men . Man 's social life becomes intolerable unless justice and benevolence govern the operations of the state and relationships between individuals and groups . God 's will is the standard by which all human actions must meet the test of rightness or wrongness . What conforms to God 's will is right ; what goes counter to His will is wrong . Unless man lives by this rule , he can not come to that abundance of life destined for him by God . If man is to reach this abundance of life , it must be through the way he lives his everyday life . He has no other course . It is idle and dangerous for him to dream otherwise . The thoughts , motives and deeds which make up his daily round will determine his growth in character . When the human heart is governed by the law of the Lord , all human actions , no matter how commonplace or how removed from the eyes of men , are made pleasing to God . This means that God 's will  | and God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When man has learned to direct his thoughts , his speech and his actions in this way , he has mastered the great maxim of the moral order ? " Not my will but Thine be done . " The point of reference in his life is no longer his own selfish will . Such a man sees that he enjoys a unique status in that God has committed to him a work which no one else in existence is to perform . This is the thought which Cardinal Newman so beautifully expressed : " God has committed some work to me which he has not committed to another . I have a part in a great work ; I am a link in the chain , a bond of connection between persons . He has not created me for naught . I shall do His work . " There is all too frequent today the spectacle of men who divide their lives to suit their own convenience . Only when it serves their selfish purpose do they conform to God 's will . Their business life , their professional life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy separate compartments unified by no central force . Expressions such as " My life is my own affair " or " I may do as I please " are all too common . We must be clear on this point . To pretend that any part of man 's life can be a private affair is to violate the most basic claim which God has on man . There is no time in his life when he is excused from obeying the moral law . In politics the principle that " ally thing goes " - is grossly wrong . W have to recover that sense of personal obligation on the part of the voter and that sense of public trust on the part of the elected official which give meaning and dignity to political life . Those who are selected for office by their fellow men are entrusted with grave responsibilities . Thev have been selected not for sell enrichment but for conscientious public service . In their speech and in their actions they are bound by I the same laws of justice and charity I which bind private individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slander , detraction and defamation of character arc as truly transgressions of God 's commandments when resorted to by men in political life as they are for all other men . There are not two standards of morality . There is only God 's standard . That single standard covers all man 's relations to God , to himself and to the world about him . By its very nature it precludes that double standard which not only tempts man to live his life on two levels but beguiles him into thinking that this can be done without any compromise of moral principles . This two-faced way of living explains the scandalous anomaly , evident at times in our national life , of paying lip service to God while failing completely to honor His claims in daily life . The single standard of morality sets a clear , positive and complete  | pattern of right living . It gives an integrity of outlook and an integrity of action to daily life . Such a life will not have its " Sunday side , " in which God 's claims are respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in which those claims are ignored for the remaining six . Rather , all aspects of life will be so integrated that the standard to which a man subscribes in his private life will be logically extended to his life in the community . Then , if faithful to moral principles as an individual , he will be faithful to moral principles as a citizen , and in all his actions as a member of society . To live by this single standard of morality man needs the motivations and sanctions which only religion can supply . He is not self-sufficient . He trust have God 's help . He need never fear the trials and tests which life imposes ; for he has the inspired words of the Psalmist to assure him : " The man whose heart is set on the law of the Lord stands firm . " We exhort Americans in every walk of life to rededicate themselves to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers a wisdom which proclaimed God 's rightful place in human affairs a wisdom so memorably expressed by the Father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity , Religion and Morality are indispensable supports . . . . Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principles . "
