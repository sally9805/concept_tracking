FISCHBECK , Honolulu Manager , Royal Hawaiian Hotel " No . And I 'm competent to answer . I was purser of the S.S. Lurline for years , with plenty of chances to watch shipboard competitions . Webster defines sportswoman : ' One who in sports is fair and generous ; a good loser and a graceful winner . ' Women of my acquaintance have been all of this . " // FURBER MARSHALL , Carlisle , Pa . President , Carlisle Corp . " Women sure are great sports . I would n't dare say anything but that . What do you want to do , ruin my marriage ? My wife is the former Sarah Hall , who , in her high school days , was captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I said , women are great sports . " // FAYE EMERSON , New Canaan , Conn . Actress " Give us a chance . Men were n't always good losers . It 's taken generations of training . Some are still poor losers . Faking injury in football to stop the clock is n't sporting . Sure , some women lose poorly to each other , but they 're the best losers to men . They 've taken it on the chin for centuries . " // THEODORE S. PETERSEN , San Francisco President , Standard Oil Co. of California " No . Women are wonderful sports . They assume most of the drudgery and the hard jobs while men go their merry way .

" // BABE DIDRIKSON , Tampa , Fla . " No . I have never competed against a woman who showed poor sportsmanship . I have watched men in sports for a long time . They are not better sports than women .

Their inherent jealousy of other women makes them poor sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The green-eyed monster may permit a girl seemingly to congratulate an opponent , but inwardly she usually fumes and seethes . " // FLORENCE SHIENTAG , New York Former Justice of Domestic Relations Court " Yes . Women are hard giver-uppers . Did you ever see women wrestlers when they get mad ? And the girls in the roller-derbies ? Sports teach generosity and good will toward opponents . That 's the wonderful thing about athletics . They are the great levelers . Women are learning . " // BRUCE BARTON , New York Advertising executive " Yes . At the finish of a recent women 's golf match , I never saw such grim and unsmiling faces .
