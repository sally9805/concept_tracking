txt Indications are increasing that Patrick B. would become as much of a storm center on the Boston &; Maine Railroad as he has been as president of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad . Directors of the B &M; are scheduled to meet in Boston at 9 o'clock tonight , with top executives and stockholders reportedly pledged to name Mr. as president of the road . Only possible hitch to this may stem from an appeal filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington yesterday by the Massachusetts Public Utilities Commission , asking that Mr. be barred from taking the presidency of the $ &M.; Hackworth Declines The PUC contended that Mr. had failed to operate the New Haven Railroad efficiently , and , therefore , was not competent to handle the affairs of the B &M.; This general apprehension was shared by many commuters on the B &M,; who have seen service on that road increase in efficiency during- the past year , even as that of the New Haven declined . New rolling stock and better maintenance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time schedules , despite extreme weather conditions , whereas run-down equipment and lack of proper maintenance has seriously interfered with New . Haven train schedules . Meanwhile , directors of the New Haven were scheduled to meet at 2 p.m. today to decide whether to accept the reSignation as head of that railroad  --  and possibly to name a successor . Yesterday , W. S. Hackworth , president of the Nashville , Chattanooga &; St. Louis Railroad , announced that he had been invited to become president of the New Haven at a salary of $75,000 a year . But , today , he turned down the offer . The name of George T. Carmichael , now senior vice-president of the New Haven , has been prominently mentioned as a possible successor to Mr. . Mr. had based his resignation on what he characterized as " unprincipled and unbridled " commuter attacks . Dividend Issue However , there was the additional element of discontent that has been engendered among large holders of common stock on the New Hav , en because of . steadily declining prices . Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the New Haven . He had assured the stockholders that if elected president , he could rehabilitate the road . While there never had been any serious thought of payment of cash dividends on common stock , because the , money was needed for improvements , Mr. had held out hopes of at least a 5 per cent stock dividend . The stockholders counted heavily on returns on their investments . However , the road ran into difficulties . Hurricanes , floods , and other elements took their toll . Maintenance was cut , and this fact was reflected in the earnings report . Prices Vary The stockholders realized that these cuts would have to be made up sometime with cash , resulting in lower earnings later on . The stockholders also had seen the value of their common stock climb for a while from $23.25 to $39 a share , and then slip backward . The stock closed day before yesterday at $26.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange , $12.25 below its high of last year . Yesterday , with the news of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $28.50 a share .. There is widespread question today whether , despite the increasing volume of complaints from commuters and consequent investigations by the public utility commissions of the four states served by the New Haven , Mr. would have resigned if the New Haven stock had continued to rise , or even maintained its gains . Financial Moves It was at the time of the New Haven annual meeting in April , 1954 , that financial allies of Mr. helped him land the presidency of the road in the belief that he . would increase the value of their stock . Mr. had pressed for control of the New Haven on the premise that : the previous management , under the presidency of Frederic C .. Dumaine , Jr. , had not been " financially successful . " It was not long after Mr. assumed the presidency of the New Haven that the records of the road showed vastly increased profits . However , critics were quick to point out that much of this increase in profits stemmed from cutting of maintenance expenses . The latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of 1955 , earnings-amounted to $5.58 a common share . This compared with earnings of only $1.90 a share for the same period of 1954 . However , during the last few months , the price of common stock has dropped . It fell as a mounting wave of protest came from commuters who were dis satisfied with the way the road was being run . Mr. was personally blamed for the repeated delays , the disruptions of service , and the mechanical failures . Interim.President ' ? The protest of the commuters brought about an investigation by the Massachusetts Public Utilities Commission , and this was augmented by the public utilities commissions of the other three states served by the New Haven ? Connecticut ; Rhode Island , and New York . Today , some doubt still existed up to the time the directors of the New Haven met at 2 o'clock as to whether the board would accept Mr. resignation immediately .. If they should , it will then be necessary to appoint a member of the board to stand as " interim president " until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified successor . Meanwhile , the Boston &; Maine Railroad has been operating without the aid of a president . Allies of Mr. had won control of the road at the last annual election , and Mr. was named as a member of the - board - of directors . His supporters indicated that Mr. was their choice for the presidency . But , it was impossible for him to be elected to that post  --  without approval from the ICC while he ' still held the presidency of the New Haven . During the controversy over this situation , Mr. finally withdrew ' his application for ICC approval of his serving both roads as president .
