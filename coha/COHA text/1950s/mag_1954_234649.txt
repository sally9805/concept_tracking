To Hollywood Haberdasher Harvey Othel Knox , 45 , picking a college for stepson Ronnie was simply a business transaction-like selling a $250 suit . A handsome 180-pounder , long-legged ( 6 ft. 1 in . ) Ronnie was one of the hottest high-school backfield stars ever to hit Southern California . Some 27 colleges were bidding for his services . For Harvey , the only question was : Which institution of higher education would be willing to pay the right price ? <P> Harvey mused over the bright promises . Was a brand-new convertible right now better , for example , than the guarantee of a future job in the oil industry ? It was a tough problem . The most intriguing offers seemed to come from partisans of the University of California at Berkeley . Did Ronnie want to be a writer ? All right-someone at Berkeley promised him a job as sportswriter on the Berkeley Gazette . Was he interested in advertising ? Fine . Alumni among the admen would be glad to get Ronnie a job in an agency . And for more immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top priority for writing jobs at the university 's proposed million-dollar TV station . Along with everything else , of course , he would get an education-even a degree . <P> The Kentucky Fort . Father Harvey decided that the U. of C. had his boy 's best interests at heart , so last year , with Harvey looking over his shoulder , Ronnie signed on the dotted line . Cracked a sportswriter : " Harvey acts as if the kid 's first name is Fort . " As a freshman , Ronnie turned in a creditable job in the classroom and on the football field . But at varsity practice this spring , Head Coach Lynn Waldorf still showed an uncommon fondness for his holdover varsity quarterback , Paul Larson , who happened to be last season 's leading collegiate ground-gainer . Father Harvey filed a loud and public demurrer . His boy was not appreciated , he said . What was more , all those fine promises were turning out to be fakes , and Ronnie 's All-America passing arm had even been put to work washing windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ronnie were capable of transferring their talents elsewhere , Harvey reminded " Pappy " Waldorf ominously . <P> The Happy Loser . Last week Ronnie made good Harvey 's threat . The boy turned up as a transfer student at U.C.L.A. , U. of C. 's arch rival . U.C.L.A. , his stepfather explained , has " courses more conducive to his learning . " In the process of changing schools , although he has merely switched to another branch of the same university , Ronnie has lost a year 's eligibility as a football player , but Harvey Knox is willing to pay the penalty in return for a chance to see Ronnie perform for two years under U.C.L.A. Coach " Red " Sanders . " I like him , " said Harvey simply . <P> The loser in the deal , Coach Waldorf , took the blow philosophically , even left a candle in the window in the event Ronnie Knox changed his mind again . " Sure we 'd take Ronnie back , " said Pappy . " But let 's transfer the old man to U.C.L.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
