Secrets of Life ( Buena Vista ) , like all the rest of Walt Disney 's nature films , is everything the eye could wish , but rather more than the ear can bear . The music sounds like a sneak attack on Debussy by MacNamara 's band , and the commentary reads like a TV pitch for nature 's way , spelled backwards . Yet across the screen there moves in lustrous color a beautifully photographed freak show . At its best , it is popular science at not very far from its best . <P> <P> The Disney presentation , of course , is far more popular than scientific , with no more method than the afternoon of a faun . One instant the camera is following the progress of a paramecium as it scoots through the heavy microscopic traffic . A few frames later the moviegoer may find himself staring at a luminous line of what seem to be huge purple carboys filled with a red-gold fluid and hanging in a rack , but prove to be vastly bloated ants-the living storage vats of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roots grow like wild white worms before the watcher 's eyes . Gourds bulge , flowers bloom , tomatoes blush . Best of all are the scenes of underwater life . The archer fish , with fearful accuracy , spits liquid arrows several feet into the air , and bags a butterfly for dinner . The angler fish , looking like nothing but a clump of seaweed , sprouts a fishing pole from its nose , and dangles a tempting piece of built-in bait before a passing mullet . Conclusion : mullet into gullet like a bullet . <P> <P> The Mountain ( Paramount ) is a fairly interesting attempt to combine in one picture a hit and a myth . Based on the 1953 novel by France 's Henri Troyat , which in turn was suggested by a 1950 plane crash in the Alps , The Mountain tells the story of an adventure that leads its adventurers to the high places of the spiritual as well as of the physical world . The adventure is intended to represent the struggle between Good and Evil , as that struggle is lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goal of life : The Mountain . All too often , though , the makers of this movie give evidence that they are hardly the men to match The Mountain . <P> Good is represented by a simple-minded old shepherd ( Spencer Tracy ) , the only man ever to climb The Mountain alone ( actually the Aiguille du Midi , near Chamonix in the French Alps , where the location shots were made ) . Evil is the younger brother ( Robert Wagner ) whom the shepherd , in the absence of a midwife , " brought into the world with his own hands . " When a plane rumored to be carrying gold crashes on top of The Mountain just as winter is setting in , little brother begs big brother to guide him up the mountain so that he can loot the plane , and the passengers too . Big brother indignantly refuses . " You want to go up The Mountain , within the sight of God , so that you can pick the pockets of dead people ? " Nevertheless , when little brother threatens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love what he would not do for money . In the language of symbol : Good would never have got going if it had not been for Evil .
