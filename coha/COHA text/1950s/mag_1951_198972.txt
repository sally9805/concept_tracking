On the maternity floor of St. Anthony 's Hospital in Michigan City , Ind. , it was a busy Saturday afternoon . Near the end of visiting hours , a knot of a dozen people stood around the window of the nursery ; inside , Nurse 's Aid Marlene Lubs , 16 , was wheeling over one bassinet after another and showing off the babies as their numbers were called by proud fathers or other relatives . Somebody asked for " 415-1 , " which meant James Lawrence Lyons , because his mother was in room 415 , bed No. 1 . Marlene Lubs did not notice whether it was a man or a woman . <P> Two hours later , another nurse 's aid noticed that Baby Lyons ' crib was empty . There was a frantic search of the hospital and grounds , police and dogs were called in , 2,000 townspeople searched alleys , trash cans , cisterns , dumps , swamps and dunes . One theory : Baby Lyons might have been kidnaped by an unbalanced , childless woman with a yearning for children. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give herself away by proudly showing off " my new baby . " <P> <P> *This was the reason for the kidnaping of a 2 lb. it oz. premature baby from New York 's Lincoln Hospital by a maid who miraculously kept the child alive for 26 days in a closet ( TIME , May 8 , 1950 ) .
