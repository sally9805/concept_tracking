The Spanish peasants on the Jarama front in 1937 were brave , but many had never even seen an automobile , and they panicked at the sight of a tank . El Campesino , their Red commander , broke them of that . Once when a tank approached he told them to lie still . He filled his belt with tin cans packed with fused dynamite . Then he slid through the weeds toward the tank . When it seemed to the peasants that El Campesino was done for , he threw twice : one bomb hit the tank 's treads , the other its turret . That finished the tank . <P> The peasants became " El Campesino 's dinamiteros , " famed antitank battalion of the Spanish Loyalist 46th Division . El Campesino ( which means the peasant ) became a top Spanish Communist general . In Russia , his picture was printed on match covers . <P> Last month , onetime Red Hero El Campesino ( real name : Valentin Gonzalez ) told a Paris court : " I am ready to go to Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions who died in concentration camps . I am ready to show them the camps where I was . I am ready to show them other camps . Then the commission will conclude that the thing called Communism is , in truth , vulgar fascism only under a red banner . " <P> Then There Were 1,200 . After Franco 's victory , Gonzalez had fled to Russia . First he was made a Soviet army general , but soon he was under arrest . He was put to digging the Moscow subway , later was shuttled from slave camp to slave camp . He told the Paris court : " Six thousand Spanish comrades came with me to Russia . When I escaped in 1948 , only 1,200 were left . The others perished . " <P> With El Campesino in the Paris courtroom was one of the largest collections of Soviet slave-camp alumni ever assembled &shy; Russians , Germans , Poles , Jews , Spaniards , and Balts . They included Jerzy Gliksman , brother of the Polish Socialist Victor Alter , who was executed by the NKVD in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( TIME , Jan. 15 ) , whom the Bolsheviks jailed in Russia in 1938 , then turned over to the Nazis in 1940 ; Julius Margolin , Tel Aviv philosophy student who traveled to France to tell the court about his six years in Soviet durance . <P> All were witnesses in a libel suit brought by French Author David Rousset against the French Communist weekly Les Lettres Franaises . Heavy , one-eyed David Rousset , 38 , an ex-inmate of Hitler 's Buchenwald , had proposed a year ago that an international commission investigate all the concentration camps in the world . Les Lettres retorted that Russia had only " correctional stockades , " that Rousset faked his evidence . Rousset sued for damages . El Campesino and the others came to testify to the reality of Soviet slave labor . <P> El Campesino boomed his accusations : " I am fulfilling the sacred pledge I made to the millions of Soviet camp inmates , also the pledge I made to those Old Bolsheviks who helped me to escape . . . It is the labor of millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rearm &shy; and to pay its foreign agents and the lawyers in trials like this . " <P> The Communist lawyers were livid . One shouted : " It 's unbelievable . Here is the Soviet Union tried by a Spaniard . An unheard-of shame &shy; " The court ordered him ousted . Another Red lawyer resorted to smearing :
