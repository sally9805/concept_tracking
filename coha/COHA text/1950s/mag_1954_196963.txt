American Indians are on the warpath against cheap Japanese imitations of tribal handicrafts . From the Southwest , the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the National Park Service have received complaints about Japanese versions of Navaho beadwork , Zuni jewelry , Hopi kachina dolls ( painted wooden dolls representing Indian deities ) . From the Northwest have come reports of made-in-Japan totem poles and ivory carvings . The Japanese imitations sell for as little as one-fifth Indian prices . Up until last year , the Park Service had a regulation against sales of foreign-made handicrafts by concessionaires in national parks , but the ban was lifted in keeping with the Eisenhower Administration 's policy of freer trade . The Indians protest that the imported beadwork is phony . But the Navaho craftsmen themselves work with factory-made beads imported from Italy and Czechoslovakia .
