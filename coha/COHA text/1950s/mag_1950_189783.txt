Fund raisers for the 92-year-old Episcopal University of the South at Sewanee , Tenn. were testing a brand new scheme . With help from Episcopal laymen in Texas , they had persuaded ranchers to cut out one or more calves , lambs or kids during branding time , burn them with a special brand-an unadorned Latin cross . Come roundup time next fall , Sewanee would get all proceeds from the sale of the cross-marked livestock .
