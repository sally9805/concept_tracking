Bus Stop ( by William Inge ) is the season 's and possibly the author 's best play . In this night-lighted picture of snow-stalled , long-distance-bus passengers huddling in a small-town eatery , the author of Picnic sounds no great depths and stirs no new currents , and he clutches sentiment to the same degree that he shrugs off story . But at its own level , Bus Stop is fresh and engaging . In catching the drift , and once or twice shifting the direction of his characters ' lives , Inge has revealed the surface and something of the underside of all anonymous humanity . And by writing with pervasive , even explosive humor-by showing that the way to man 's heart can be through his funny bone-Inge has not just brightened , he has also enlarged his picture . <P> Bus Stop chiefly chronicles a raw , rambunctious young cowboy 's courtship-which is virtually a kidnaping-of a soiled young Kansas City nightclub singer . Very slowly the clodhopper ( Albert Salmi ) discovers that an ounce of tenderness is worth a pound of bluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluster of a sexual tenderfoot . And the girl discovers that , though courted as though she were a punching bag , she is for once being thought of as though she were a lady . <P> Along with its taming of an oaf , Bus Stop chronicles the far more offhand and slightly more underhand amour of the proprietress and the bus driver ( Elaine Stritch and Patrick McVey ) , records the spoutings , slitherings and slumbers of a drunken professor ( Anthony Ross ) . There is also the wide-eyed high-school girl who finds the professor wonderful , there is an unrambunctious cowboy with a guitar , and there is a local sheriff who perhaps stands for law and order in the world as well as on Main Street . In a beautifully paced and harmonized production , every part is well played , and Kim Stanley plays the nightclub singer superbly . <P> There is far more health and humor to Bus Stop than to Playwright Inge 's Picnic , but it too treats largely , at bottom , of lonely lives . If Inge 's bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking symbol for his whole lost , seeking , itinerant world . The peripheral figure remains the central one in Inge 's gallery . But in Bus Stop there are integrated figures also ; the shadows are interlaced with sunlight , the naturalistic brooder is absorbed into the humorist . The difference between the two plays is also partly one of production . Where Picnic so stressed theatrical values as to ossify human ones , Bus Stop , under Harold Clurman 's understanding direction , seamlessly blends the two . Despite deeper entanglements , Picnic was all surfaced glare ; Bus Stop , for all its outward humors , catches an inner glow .
