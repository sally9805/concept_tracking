Ever since the 1946 Bikini A-bomb tests demonstrated what an atomic bomb could do to an old-style naval task force , U.S. admirals have been contemplating their naval strategy in an attempt to define the Navy 's place in modern atomic war . Oddly enough , the hydrogen bomb gave them an unexpected assist : even land-based airmen recognized that a Russian H-bomb attack could be devastating to U.S. airfields , saw virtue in a mobile , seagoing air power capable of delivering atomic attack from unexpected directions . <P> In a recent speech Assistant Navy Secretary for Air James H. Smith Jr . described the Navy 's role in a future war . Said Smith : <P> " We can visualize the future carrier striking force as a handful of large ships able to maintain high speeds in all sea conditions-say three large carriers , seven cruisers , and two high-speed supply ships per task force . . . This force will be spread out over an ocean area the size of the state of Maine . It will be so widely dispersed that no single weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one ship . <P> " Such a force could pack this kind of a great offensive punch . It could include aircrafts able to deliver large weapons under all weather conditions , against enemy bases 1,500 miles or more distant . . . Operating with such carrier forces will be advanced forces of nuclear-powered submarines launching atomic missiles against targets at relatively short ranges . . . These forces would be fully self-sustaining for some 30 days of war operations . . . <P> " Because of the dispersion of the force 's ships and the range of its weapons , such a carrier force could exert a tight and exclusive control over an area of 60,000 square miles-the six New England states rearranged into a circle 275 miles in diameter . . . Nuclear warheads would be available for missiles fired against large bomber formations . . . Nuclear anti-submarine weapons would be available . . . "
