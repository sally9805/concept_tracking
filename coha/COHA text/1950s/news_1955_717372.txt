txt Canada called on members of the United Nations General Assembly today to respond to the efforts of the great powers to relax international ten-sion : - Paul Martin , Canadian Minister of National Health and Welfare , told the Assembly that ) all delegates must acknowledge their debt to the Big Four heads of government . He : urged them to show equal moderation and restraint during debates . At the Big Four meeting in . Geneva last summer , Mr. Martin declared , the leaders " lookedI squarely at the appalling , brute facts of life and decided that man must not be allowed to ex ? tinguish himself when - he could be ' saved by the use of human intelligence . " Mr. Martin added that on the key issue , disarmament , Canada was " more hopeful than at any time in the past ten years . " He cautioned , however , that " early decisions " on the establishment of a disarmament system should not be expected . Other Proposals Mentioned Mr. Martin explained that first there must be " experimental phases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without which disarmament would be impossible . " After these were attained , he said- an " enormous amount " of studywould be needed to draw up a system of enforcement . Mr. Martin , who represents Canada on the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission , said that " after long and difficult negotiations " some " degree of agreement on a disarmament plan seemed in sight . He added that there was no reason why all the great-power proposals before the subcommittee , including President Eisenhower 's plan for a warning system against surprise attack , should not become " steps along the way " toward disarmament Mr. Martin reminded the Assembly ? that other plans before the subcommittee were : the French proposal for budgetary restrictions on defense expenditures ; the British proposal ' for a joint inspection system to determine the size of the armed forces and non-atomic . armaments that the West and the Soviet bloc maintain in Germany ; the Soviet ' proposal of May 10 for disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons , which Premier Nikoliti A. Bulganin resubmitted at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet proposal made important advances , its provisions for inspection and control were still inadequate . He did not refer to Marshal Bulganin 's letter to the President last week about the Eisenhower plan , or to the recent announcement by Harold E. Stassen that the United States was reserving its position on all disarmament proposals made before the Geneva meeting . Stassen Given Instructions Disarmament is one of the principal topics now on the agenda of the meeting of Big Four foreign ministers that is to be held in Geneva , at the end of October . However , the President has been so closely concerned with this issue that some delegates believe it may be impossible for the Big Four to take definite decisions until after he is able to resume his duties . American sources , however , said that before his illness the President gave Mr. Stassen detailed instructions on the United States position , and that the negotiations would not be delayed . It had already been decided to postpone the disarmament debate in the General Assembly until after the Geneva meeting . The United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Minister , said that further efforts to achieve disarmament ? were an essential part of the attempt to reduce tension . He suggested an , agreement " as of now " not to increase expenditures on- armaments and armed forces . The Yugoslay. delegate noted that some countries had already begun reducing their military forces , but did not mention the Soviet Union by name . However , he said that there had been " a significant improvement " in the last year in Yugoslavia 's rela // CANADA ASKS U. N.

' a major contribution to the removal of one of the sources of tension ht Europe.w Mr. Popovic emphasized the improvement in the international climate since the General Assembly 's 1951 session and urged a " political " instead of a " mili- ' tary or ideological " approach to the solution of world problems . U. N. Applicants Endorsed Both Mr. Popovic and Mr. Martin endorsed the admission ! of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations membership . Whereas Mr. Popovic favored the admission of all candidates ) " whose international status is not actually in doubt , " Mr. Mar-1 tin said " a very large proportion " should be admitted . He lid not go into details . However , Mr. Martin said he wanted question the mathematics of Vyacheslav M. Molotov , Soviet Foreign Minister , who told the Assembly Friday that he favored the admission of the " sixteen states that have applied for membership . " Last week , before Spain submitted her application , there were twenty-one applicants . Mr. Molotov was  --  thus ignoring those of North and ? South Korea , North and South Vietnam and Japan . Mr. Martin twitted M. Molotov on the omission of Japan , pointing out that even if the applications from Korea and Vietnam were excluded there would still remain seventeen . Mr. Popovic 's statement was apparently an endorsement of the Soviet " package , " which would include five Soviet Satellites , Bulgaria , Rumania , Hungary , Albania and Outer Mongolia , as well as Austria , Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jordan , Libya , Nepal and Portugal .
