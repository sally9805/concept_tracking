What is it that looks like a coffee bean , tastes like a crisp pistachio nut and crackles when munched ? As any Colombian gourmet knows , it is a toasted queen ant from Santander Department , and the very thought of the tasty tidbit is enough to make his mouth water . <P> Last week as the seasonal rains fell , signaling the start of ant harvest time , Santandereano peasants bolted their spring planting and scrambled as fast as their bare feet would take them to the dune-like ant hills that dot the countryside near the city of Bucaramanga . Stepping lively to avoid the angry swarms of worker ants , they seized the inch-long queens as they emerged , and popped them into hollowed calabashes . The nimblest harvesters caught up to three lbs . of ants in a morning 's work . <P> Rendering the captive queens edible requires little culinary art . The ants are toasted in their own fat on thin clay roof tiles over a wood fire , then salted lightly . Since they contain formic acid , a natural preservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are displayed in large fiber baskets . <P> For toasted ants it is always a seller 's market in Colombia . A favorite cocktail delicacy , and popularly reputed to give their eaters courage , they are so highly regarded that Colombians call them the " caviar of Santander . " The only thing they dislike about the ants this season is the sky-high price of ten pesos ( $1.34 ) per lb. ( about 150 ants ) .
