As the first signs of spring began to appear across the countryside last week , a U.S. farm magazine turned young farmers ' thoughts to the problems of taking a wife . In its spring issue , The Farm Quarterly ( cir. 189,000 ) warned the young farmer to be careful to select the proper strain . Its recommendations , with some adjustments , were thought-provoking for city cousins , too . <P> " A Piece of Equipment . " " When a farmer buys a cow , " wrote Farm Editor R. J. McGinnis , " he looks at her long and carefully , goes over her point by point , and weighs his pocketbook against her virtues and her faults . He should be no less calculating when he takes a wife . . . This flinthearted approach . . . will appear to many , especially the female sex , as a way of saying that a wife should be regarded as a piece of farm equipment . That is quite right . <P> " Romance is only a minor consideration in selecting a farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love will likely come along , in the field while she is pitching hay up to him , or in the barn when she whacks Daisy for stepping on her foot . . . After all , a farmer can give only a very small part of his time to love , working as he does from sun to sun and then falling into bed dead tired after an early supper . " <P> The farmer often uses " very slipshod methods " in selecting a wife . " The eligible-bachelor farmer falls victim of a moonlight night , or a dulcet voice , or a sniff of My Sin , never giving a thought as to whether or not the creature in his arms can strip a cow dry or hoist the back end of a wagon . . . Farmers do n't usually fall in love with the deep-bosomed , wide-hipped , somewhat unimaginative women who make the best farm wives . " <P> A Test for a Pigeon . A young farmer who must make his way should select a " Type I " wife . She should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have more than a high-school education , and " should not be disturbed by muddy boots in her kitchen , nor by the dogs sleeping under the stove . . . nor the continuous parade of newborn pigs and lambs in bushel baskets by the kitchen stove . She should be farm-reared . . . It takes a woman a long time to learn how to get her weight properly under a bale of hay . " <P> Since a Type I wife is a " rare flower , " a likely alternative is " Type II . . . a much commoner species . " Pretty , educated and sensitive , she adds to rather than fits into the farm scene , is more suitable for the farmer who inherited his land from grandpa than for the poor but ambitious tiller of the soil . For her , intelligence and education are not necessarily handicaps ; she " should be able to carry on a conversation with either the hired hand or a banker whose note is due . . . She should look well in blue jeans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Unable to find a rare Type I , how can the young farmer at least run a test on Type II ? " Take your candidate to the fields and the barns . Escort her across a muddy feed lot , lead her through poison ivy and , poison and all , take her to a dance . She 'll complain . . . but if she comes back for more , she 's your pigeon . "
