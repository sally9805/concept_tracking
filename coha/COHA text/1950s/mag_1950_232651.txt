One of the sharpest thorns in East Germany 's Communist hide is a 14-month-old underground organization directed from West Berlin . The Investigating Committee of Free Lawyers of the Soviet Zone was founded by Dr. Theo Friedenau , 39-year-old lawyer , who has a 500,000 East mark Communist price tag on his head . His organization of 3.000 East German lawyers , judges and public officials exposes Soviet zone perversions of justice and tries to frighten Communist officials by reporting their crimes to Friedenau in Berlin . <P> Friedenau keeps the ever-mounting score for future retribution , never stops telling the Reds about it . A constant flow of warnings from , his typewriter penetrates East Germany . Before the zone 's rigged October election , the underground blanketed the countryside with posters and carefully documented pamphlets blasting Red nominees as crooks and stooges . Bald , professorial Lawyer Friedenau , whose black sideburns reach almost to his chin , boasts that as a result of underground activity 70% of East zone finance offices recently refused to enforce Communist directives expropriating business enterprises . <P> Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the East German Communists imprisoned seven Thuringian bank officials after a trial at Erfurt on trumped-up charges of " sabotage . " Friedenau knew all about it . <P> For four months he had had in his possession the complete Communist file of the evidence , prepared by the trial 's original prosecutor , handsome , 34-year-old Heinz Perscheid , who fled to West Germany last August rather than proceed with the case . Perscheid 's dossier was dynamite . It proved that the Red 's judicial masquerade was staged to smash the Liberal Democratic Party , to which the defendants belonged , because it had refused to collaborate with the Socialist Unity ( Communist ) Party . Perscheid had received special tutelage from Fritz Lange , chairman of East Germany 's State Control Commission . Perscheid quoted Lange as telling him : " The prosecution and court are our mouthpieces . What we blow into them from the back must come out in front like notes from a flute . " Shortly before Perscheid fled , Lange dictated a new and harsher charge sheet , threatened that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arrested in court as an Anglo-American agent . " <P> The defendants got sentences of from two to 15 years , but East and West Germans , thanks to Perscheid and Friedenau , got a detailed picture of the dress rehearsal for the frame-up.
