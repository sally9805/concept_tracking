The Glass Slipper ( M-G-M ) , Hollywood feels about as comfortable with Leslie Caron as a truck driver does with a beret-whatever it is , it 's not normal . Everybody loved her in Lili ( TIME , March 9 ' . 1953 ) ) but what was it everybody loved ? Was she pretty ? Not by the usual U.S. standards . Could she act ? In Lili it was hard to tell whether she was acting , or just doing what came naturally . " She 's gamine , " the critics said . The producers asked their wives what that meant , and decided that , as usual , the critics were wrong . A studio flack perhaps came closer to the truth of the matter when he said : " The face of an eight-year-old girl , the body of a voluptuous woman . It 's practically perverse . She 's the poor little match girl-with sex . " <P> The Glass Slipper breathes , as Lili did , the atmosphere of a latter-day fairy tale . It is , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to the perfume ads . The prince ( Michael Wilding ) no longer loves his lass just because she is beautiful . He admires her " great agonized . . . rebellious eyes . " The glass slipper is now made of " the finest Venetian glass . " And the fairy godmother ( Estelle Winwood ) is a queer old dear who wanders around saying " window sill " because it sounds so nice . <P> Still , there are some pleasant things here too . Some of the scenes have a Lili-like lilt . One of the ballets , in which Michael gives Leslie a cooking lesson in the palace kitchen , is a sightly romp . The color is fresh and bright . Cinderella 's dress for the ball is wonderful-the skirt looks like a frilly igloo* - and Leslie wears it as a princess should . And when all else fails , there is Keenan Wynn . As somebody called Kovin , a confidant of the prince , poor Keenan has practically nothing to do all through the picture except to stride up and down in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suck on a long-stemmed pipe , and grunt . It all gets a little eerie , after a while . <P> One Summer of Happiness ( Times Film ) . " Say , let 's swim ! " cries Goran ( Folk Sundquist ) . He is alone with Kerstin in the woods near the edge of a lake , and the day is as warm as days ever get in Sweden . Kerstin ( Ulla Jacobsson ) , who is only 17 , dimples and looks away , but then she says , " For you I 'm not bashful . " They undress and run laughing and gasping into the icy shallows . The laughter dies on Goran 's lips as he sees her standing there , pretty as a pear . " Kerstin ! " he says . She turns toward hirn with a yielding look , and he takes her in his arms . " Goran , " she murmurs dreamily . " Do n't forget me ! " Without a word he carries her to the shore , where they lie in a sun-spangled shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaware that the camera is gawking under his armpit at the girl . " Do you know what this means ? "
