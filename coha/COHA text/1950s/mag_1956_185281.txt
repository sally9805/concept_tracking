Two days before the people of the Saar went to the polls to elect a new Parliament , French newspapers were gloomily telling their readers : " The Saar is lost . " After all , only two months before , the German-speaking miners and farmers of the coal-rich Saar basin had seemed to demonstrate their preference for Germany by rejecting ( more than two to one ) a Franco-German proposal to " Europeanize " them . Yet last week , when the results were in , it was the confident Germans , not the French , who were bitterly disappointed . Pro-German parties won almost two-thirds of the total vote ( and 33 out of the 50 seats in Parliament ) , but they failed by a tidy margin to carry the 75% majority they need to push through a merger of the Saar and West Germany . <P> Under lackluster Dr. Hubert Ney , 62 , the pro-German Christian Democrats ( an offshoot of Konrad Adenauer 's West German C.D.U. ) rolled up 25.4% of the vote . The Social Democrats took a beating ( 14.3% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-wing Democrats ( 24.2% ) , under ex-Nazi Heinrich Schneider . The big surprise was that tubby little " Jojo " Hoffmann , the Francophile ex-Premier , cornered a solid 21.8% ( and 13 seats in Parliament ) for his Christian People 's Party . Hoffmann 's supporters , who favor continued economic collaboration between the Saar and France , cannily reminded middle-class Saarlanders that West German taxes might make a bigger hole in their pocketbooks than their own French-style system . <P> France and Germany have squabbled over the Saar since the division of Charle-magnefe empire . France , which would no longer be in the same industrial league as West Germany if the Saar 's coal and steel changed hands , concedes that it can not prevent the Saarlanders from rejoining their kinsmen at some future time , but it insists on a guaranteed share of Saar production , and German nationalists noisily object . Chancellor Konrad Adenauer , a good European , believes that Franco-German understanding is more important than anything that impedes it , and accordingly will not be trying to hurry the Saar into reunification at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
