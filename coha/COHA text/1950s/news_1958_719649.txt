txt The cost of man 's first round trip to the moon will be roughly $2,000,000,000 . This is the estimate quoted by eighteen of the nation 's leading scientists in a " space primer " compiled for Administration guidance and made public today by the White House . When man may be ready to use this multi-billion dollar round-trip ticket , the scientists were uncertain . It could be within ten or twenty years , they said , or it might not be until the twenty-first century . Probably , they estimated , it would not come until after " minimal contact " had been made with Venus and Mars and after man had flown around the world aboard an orbiting satellite . These and other estimates of what is feasible and what should not be done in space were included in a 4,000-word Intro'duction to Outer Space , com- piled by the President 's science advisory committee , under the chairmanship of Dr. - mes R. Killian Jr . President Eisenhower ordered the document published , he said , because he found it " so informative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of America and indeed with all the people of the earth . " The report , he Said , " is not science - fiction " but " a sober , realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists " and should give everyone " the opportunity to share , through understanding , in the adventures which lie ahead . " The net . of the scientists ' message was to indicate in the most general way an order of priorities by which various space projects could proceed and to debunk some of the wilder speculation loosed on the public in the last six months . In the debunking category was the scientists ' extreme reluctance to make a firm guess about when pan might make his first trip tohe moon and back . Early Estimate Doubted - Less sober estimates have stated that it could be done within a decade . The Killian group did not close the door to this possibility but it also suggested that the trip might not be made in this century .

" Granted that they will become technologically possible , most of these schemes , nevertheless , appear to be clums yand ineffective ways of doing a job . " For example , it noted , the difficulties in launching a bomb from a satellite moving at 18,000 miles an hour were considerably greater than in launching the same weapon from earth-bound bases . " In short , the earth would appear to be , after all , the best weapons carrier . " Oppose Moon Atom Blast The Killian group also made a scientific argument against firing nuclear weapons into the moon . Some scientists believed that small particles with the properties of life could have drifted onto the moon from out of space , they said . " If we are to test this intriguing hypothesis , . we must be careful not to contaminate the moon 's surface , in the biological sense . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contamination of the moon until its naturally ac- quired radioactivity can be measured . " In the order of priorities , the group suggested that the earliest space ventures concentrate on amassing research data . For example , a phase of Einstein 's relativity theory could be tested , cosmic ray data amassed , the flow of solar energy measured , and data gathered on the effect of space travel ? on animal physiology and psychology , they said . In aiming for the moon , they said , there were three stages that would have to be mastered . First would be a simple shot of some object that would either smash into the lunar surface or circle the moon . Second would be a " soft " landing ; that is , one that a man could walk away from . Third would be a " soft " landing and a safe return to earth , a job that would require a rocket engine with " thrust " in the neighborhood of one or two million pounds .
