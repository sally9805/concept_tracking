" Yes , Himmell wrote that even before Cavesword , in the month of March , I believe , though we 'll have to ask my colleague when he comes . He knows all the dates , all the facts . Remarkable guy .

" Semantics were either no longer taught or else Butler had never been interested in them . " Why it just means , well , a lutherist . " " I wonder , though , what the derivation of it was .

We 've had no serious trouble for forty years . " " Forty years . . . that was the time of all the trouble , " I said . " Not so much trouble , " said Butler , undoing the bandana and mopping his face with it .

It 's the newest edition but of course the text goes right back to the early days when Cave was in prison . " Oh , yes , in California . " " Sure ; it was the beginning of the persecutions . Well , I 've got to be on my way . " He got heavily to his feet and arranged the bandana about his head . " Somebody stole my hat . Persecutingme , I 'll bet my bottom dollar . . . little ways .

" And so John Cave 's period in jail was now known as the time of persecution , with a pious prison dialogue attributed to Iris . Before I returned to my work of recollection , I glanced at the dialogue whose style was enough like Iris 's to have been her work . But of course her style was not one which could ever have been called inimitable since it was based on the most insistent of twentieth-century advertising techniques . I assumed the book was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had created , according to a list of publications on the back of the booklet , a wealth of Cavite doctrine . The conversation with Cave in prison was lofty in tone and seemed to deal with moral problems . It was apparent that since the task of governing is largely one of keeping order it had become , with the passage of time , necessary for the Cavite rulers to compose in Cave 's name different works of ethical instruction to be used for the guidance and control of the population . I assume that since they now control allp105records , all original sources , it is an easy matter for them to " discover " some relevant text which gives clear answer to any moral or political problem which has not been anticipatedin previous commentaries . The work of falsifying records , expunging names is , I should think , somewhat more tricky but they seem to have accomplished it in Cave 's Testament , brazenly assuming that those who recall the earlier versionswill die off in time , leaving a generation which knows only what they wish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of nonconformists , of base lutherists . Cave 's term in prison was far less dramatic than official legend , though more serious . He was jailed for hit-and-run driving on the highway from Santa Monica into Los Angeles . I went to see him that evening with Paul . When we arrived at the jail , we were not allowed near him though Paul 's lawyers had been permitted to go inside a few minutes before our arrival . Iris was sitting in the outer office , pale and shaken . A bored policeman in uniform sat fatly at a desk at the other end of the office , ignoring us . " They 're the best lawyers in L.A. , " said Paul quickly . " They 'll get him out in no time . " Iris looked at him bleakly . " What happened ? " I asked , sitting down beside her on the bench . " How did it happen ? " " I was n't with him . " She shook her head several times as though to dispel a profound daydream . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , Paul ? " " I can vouch that . . . " " Did he kill anybody ? " " We . . . we do n't know yet . He hit an old man and went on driving . I do n't know why ; I mean why he did n't stop . He just went on and the police car caught him . The man 's in the hospital now . They say it 's bad ; he 's unconscious , an old man . . . " " Any reporters here ? " asked Paul . " Anybody else know besides us ? "  | " Nobody . You 're the only person I called . " " This could wreck everything . " Paul was frightened . But Cave was rescued , at considerable expense to the company . The old man chose not to die immediately while the police and the courts of Los Angeles , at that time well known for their accessibility to free-spending reason , proved more than obliging . After a day and a night in prison , Cave was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was handled discreetly by the magistrate . The newspapers , however , had discovered John Cave at last and there were photographs of " Present-Day Messiah in Court . " As ill luck would have it , the undertakers of Laguna had come to the aid of their prophet with banners which proclaimed his message . This picketing of the court was photographedand exhibited in the tabloids . Paul was in a frenzy . Publicist though he was , in his first rage he expressed to me the novel sentiment that not all publicity was good . " But we 'll get back at those bastards , " he said grimly , not identifying which ones he meant but waving toward the city hidden by the Venetian blinds of his office window . I asked for instructions . Cave had , the day before , gone back to Washington to lie low until the time was right for a triumphant reappearance . Iris had gone with him ; on a separate plane , however , to avoid scandal . Clarissa had sent various heartening if confused messages from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the pieces and begin again . Our close association during those difficult days impressed me with his talents and though , fundamentally , I still found him appalling , I could n't help but admire his superb operativeness . " I 'm going ahead with the original plan . . . just like none of this happened . The stockholders are willing and we 've got enough money , though not as much as I 'd like , for the publicitybuild-up . I expect Cavell pick up some more cash in Seattle . He always does , wherever he goes . " " Millionaires just flock to him ? "  | " Strange to tell , yes . But then nearly everybody does . " " It 's funny since the truth he offers is all there is to it . Once experienced , there 's no longer much need for Cave or for an organization . " This of course was the paradox which time and the unscrupulous were bloodily to resolve . Paul 's answer was reasonable . " That 's true but there 's the problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death the whole world would be happier and , if it 's happier , why , it 'll be a better place to live in . " " Do you really believe this ? " " Still think of me as a hundred percent phony ? " Paul chuckled good-naturedly . " Well , it so happens , I do believe that . It also so happens that if this thing clicks we 'll have a world organization and if we have that there 'll be a big place for number one in it . It 's all mixed up , Gene . I 'd like to hear your motives , straight from the shoulder . " I was not prepared to answer him , or myself . In fact , to this day , my own motives are a puzzle to which there is no single key , no easy definition . One is not , after all , like those classic or neo-classic figures who wore with such splendid monomaniacalconsistency the scarlet of lust or the purple of dominion , or the bright yellow of madness , existing not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in my youth but only as a minor pleasure and not as an end in itself or even as a means to any private or public end . I enjoyed the idea of guiding and dominating others , preferablyin the mass ; yet , at the same time , I did not like the boredom of power achieved , or the silly publicness of a great life . But there was something which , often against my will and judgment , precipitated me into deeds and attitudes where the logic of the moment controlled me to such an extent that I could not lessen , if I chose , the momentum of my own wild passage , or chart its course . I would not have confided this to Paul even had I in those days thought any of it out , which I had not . Though I was conscious of some fundamental ambivalence in myself , I alwaysfelt that should I pause for a few moments and ques/tion myself , I could easily find answers to these problems . But I did not pause . I never asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man sleeping who was only barely made conscious by certain odd incongruities that he dreams . The secret which later I was to discover was still unrevealedto me as I faced the efficient vulgarity of Paul Himmellacross the portable bar which reflected so brightly in its crystal his competence . " My motives are perfectly simple , " I said , half-believing what I said . In those days the more sweeping the statement the more apt I was to give it my fickle allegiance : motives are simple , splendid ! simple they are . " I want something to do . I 'm fascinated by Cave and I believe what he says . . . not that it is so supremely earthshaking . It 's been advanced as a theory off and on for two thousand years . Kant wrote that he anticipatedwith delight the luxurious sleep of the grave and the Gnostics came close to saying the same thing when they promiseda glad liberation from life . The Eastern religions , about which I know very little , maintain ... " That 's it ! " Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You just keep on like that . We 'll call it An Introduction to John Cave . ' Make a small book out of it . Get it published in New York ; then the company will buy up copies and we 'll pass it out free . " " I 'm not so sure that I know enough formal philosophy to ... " " To hell with that stuff . You just root around and show how the old writers were really Cavites at heart and then you come to him and put down what he says . Why we 'll be half-there even before he 's on TV ! " Paul lapsed for a moment into a reverie of promotion . I had another drink and felt quite good myself although I had serious doubts about my competence to compose philosophy in the popular key . But Paul 's faith was infectious and I felt that , all in all , with a bit of judicious hedging and recourse to various explicit summaries and definitions , I might put together a respectable ancestry for Cave whose message , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hypnotic effectiveness to the main proposition : death and man 's acceptance of it . The problems of life were always quite secondary to Cave , if not to the rest of us . " When will you want this piece done ? " " The sooner the better . Here , " he scribbled an address on a pad of paper . " This is Cave 's address . I Ie 's on a farm outside Spokane . It belongs to one of his undertaker friends . " " Iris is with him ? " " Yes . Now you . . . " " I wonder if that 's wise , Iris seeing so much of him . You know he 's going to have a good many enemies before very long and they 'll dig around for any scandal they can find . " " Oh , it 's perfectly innocent , I 'm sure . Even if it is n't , I ca n't see how it can do much harm . " " For a public relations man you do n't seem to grasp the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pub .. : ' " Is good . But Cave , it appears is a genuine ascetic . " And the word " genuine " as I spoke it was like a knife-blade in my heart . " And , since he is , you have a tremendous advantage in building him up . There 's no use in allowing him , quite innocently , to appear to philander . " Paul looked at me curiously . " You would n't by chance be interested in Iris yourself ? " And of course that was it . I had become attached to Iris in precisely the same sort of way a complete man might have been but of course for me there was no hope , nothing . The enormity of that nothing shook me , despite the alcohol we had drunk . I was sufficiently collected , though , not to make the mistake of vehemence . " I like her very much but I 'm more attached to the idea of Cave than I am to her . I do n't want to see the business get out of hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all people involved , are n't more concerned . " " You may have a point . I suppose I 've got to adjust my views to this thing . . . it 's different from my usual work building up crooners and movie stars . In that line the romance angle is swell , just as long as there 're no bigamies or abortions in/volvcd . I sec your point , though . With Cave we have to think in sort of Legion of Decency terms . No rough stuff . No nightclubpictures or posing with blondes . You 're absolutely right . Put that in your piece : does n't drink , does n't go out with dames . . . " I laughed at this seriousness . " Maybe we wo n't have to go that far . The negative virtues usually shine through all on their own . The minute you draw attention to them you create suspicion : people are generally pleased to suspect the opposite of every avowal . " " You talk just like my analyst . " And I felt that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , you go to Spokane ; talk to Iris ; tell her to lay off . . . in a tactful way of course . I would n't mention it to him : you never can tell how he 'll react . She 'll be reasonable even though I suspect she 's stuck on the man . Try and get your piece done by the first of December . I 'd like to have it in print for the first of the New Year , Cave 's year . " " I 'll try . " " By the way , we 're getting an office . . . same building as this . The directors okayed it and we 'll take over as soon as there 's some furniture in it . " " Cavites , Inc. ? " " We could hardly call it the Church of the Golden Rule , " said Paul with one of the few shows of irritability I was ever to observe in his equable disposition . " Now , on behalf of the directors , I 'm authorized to advance you whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , within ... " " I wo n't need anything except , perhaps , a directorship in the company . " My own boldness startled me . Paul laughed . " That 's a good boy . Eye on the main chance . Well , we 'll see what we can do about that . There are n't any more shares available right now but that does n't mean . . . . I 'll let you know when you get back from Spokane . " Our meeting was ended by the appearance of his secretary who called him away to other business . As we parted in the outer office , he said , quite seriously , " I do n't think Iris likesp111him the way you think but if she does be careful . We ca n't upset Cave now . This is a tricky time for everyone . Do n't show that you suspect anything when you 're with him . Later , when we 're under way , and there 's less pressure , I 'll handle it . Agreed ? " I agreed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in love , " to this moment the phrase has a strangely foreign sound to me , like a classical allusion not entirely understood in some decorous , scholarly text . " In love , " I whispered to myself in the elevator as I left Paul that evening : in love with Iris . We met at the Spokane railroad station and Iris drove me through the wide , clear , characterless streets to a country road which wound east into the hills , in the direction of a town with the lovely name of Coeur d'Alene . She was relaxed . Her ordinarily pale face was faintly burned from the sun while her hair , which I recalled as darkly waving , was now streaked with light and worn loosely bound at the nape of her neck . She wore no cosmetics and her dress was simple cotton beneath the sweater she wore against the autumn'schill . She looked young , younger than either of us actually was . At first we talked of Spokane . She identified mountains and indicated hidden villages with an emphasis on place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the main highway into a country road , dark with fir and spruce , did she ask me about Paul . " He 's very busy getting the New Year 's debut ready . He 's also got a set of offices for the company in Los Angeles and he 's engaged me to write an introduction to Cave ... but I suppose you knew that when he wired you I was coming . " " It was my idea . " " My coming ? or the introduction ? " " Both . I talked to him about it just before we came up here . "  | " And I thought he picked it out of the air while listening to me majestically place Cave among the philosophers . " Iris smiled . " Paul 's not obvious . He enjoys laying traps and , as long as they 're for one 's own good , he 's very useful . " " Implying he could be destructive ? " " Immensely . So be on your guard even though I do n't think he 'll harm any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm worried , Gene . He has n't got over that accident . He talks about it continually . " " But the man did n't die . " " It would be better if he did . . . as it is there 's a chance of a lawsuit against Cave for damages . " " But he has no money . " " That does n't prevent them from suing . Worst of all , though , would be the publicity . The whole thing has depressedJohn terribly . It was all I could do to keep him from announcing to the press that he had almost done the old man a favor . " " You mean by killing him ? " Iris nodded , quite seriously . " That 's actually what he believesand the reason why he drove on . " " I 'm glad he said nothing like that to the papers . " " But it 's true ; his point of view is exactly right . " " Except that the old man might regard the situation in a different light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not receive Cave 's gift of death . " " Now you 're making fun of John . " She frowned and drove fast on the empty road . " I 'm doing no such thing . I 'm absolutely serious . There 's a moral problem involved which is extremely important and if a precedent is set too early , a bad one like this , there 's no predicting how things will turn out . " " You mean the . . . the gift as you call it should only be given voluntarily ? " " Exactly . . . if then , and only in extreme cases . Think what might happen if those who listened to Cave decided  |p113to  make all their friends and enemies content by killing them . " " Well , I wish you 'd talk to him . " She smiled sadly . " I 'm afraid I do n't always see things clearly when I 'm with him . You know how he is . . . how he convinces . " " I 'll talk to him tactfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief from him . " " But you have it already . We all have it . " " Then I 'll want some moral application of it . We have so much ground to cover yet . " " There 's the farm , up there on the hill . " A white frame building stood shining among elms on a low hill at the foot of blue sharp mountains . She turned up a dirt road and , in silence , we arrived at the house . An old woman , the cook , greeted us familiarly and told Iris that he could be found in the study . In a small warm room , sitting beside a stone fireplace empty of fire , Cave sat , a scrapbook on his knees , his expression vague , unfocused . Our arrival recalled him from some dense reverie . He got to his feet quickly and shook hands ; " I 'm glad you came , " he said . " I wanted to see you , " I said awkwardly : it was Cave 's particular gift to strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his greetings which became , as a result , disconcertinglylike benedictions . Iris excused herself and I sat beside him in front of the fireplace . " Have you seen these ? " he asked , pushing the scrapbooktoward me . " I took it and nodded when I saw , neatly pasted and labeled , the various newspaper stories concerning the accident . It had got a surprisingly large amount of space asthough , instinctively , the editors had anticipated a coming celebrity for " Hit-and-Run Prophet . " " Look what they say about me . " " I 've read them all , " I said , handing the scrapbook back to him , a little surprised that , considering his unworldliness , he had bothered to keep such careful track of his appearance  |p114in  the press . It showed a new , rather touching side to him : he was like an actor hoarding his notices , good and bad . " I do n't think it 's serious : after all you were let off by the court , and the man did n't die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old man nearly received the greatest gift a man can have , a quick death . I wanted to tell the court that . I could 've convinced them , I 'm sure , but Paul said no . It was the first time I 've ever gone against my own instinct and I do n't like it . " Emphatically , he shut the book . We watched the cook who came into the room and lit the fire . When the first crackling filled the room and the pine had caught , she left , observing that we were to eat in an hour . " You want to wash up ? " asked Cave mechanically , his eyes on the fire , his hands clasped in his lap like those dingy marble replicas of hands which decorate medieval tombs : that night there was an unhuman look to Cave : pale , withdrawn , inert . . . his lips barely moving when he spoke , as though another 's voice spoke through senseless flesh . " No thanks , " I said , a little chilled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the subject of the accident as quickly as possible and we talked until dinner of the introduction I was to write . It was most enlightening . As I suspected , Cave had read only the Bible and that superficially , just enough to be able , at crucial moments , to affect the seventeenthcenturyprose of the translators and to confound thereby simple listeners with the familiar authority of his manner . His knowledge of philosophy did not even encompass the names of the principals . Plato and Aristotle rang faint , unrelated bells and with them the meager carillon ended . " I do n't know why you want to drag in those people , " he said , after I had suggested Zoroaster as a possible point of beginning . " Most people have never heard of them either . And what I have to say is all my own . It does n't tie in with any of them or , if it does , it 's a coincidence because I never picked it up anywhere . "  | " I think , though , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree for you , to show . . . " " I do n't . " He gestured with his effigy-hands . " Let them argue about it later . For now , act like this is a new beginning , which it is . I have only one thing to give people and that is the way to die without fear , gladly . . . to accept nothing for what it is , a long and dreamless sleep . " I had to fight against that voice , those eyes which as always , when he chose , could dominate any listener . Despite my close association with him , despite the thousands of times I heard him speak , I was never , even in moments of lucid disenchantment , quite able to resist his power . He was a magician in the great line of Simon Magus and the Faust of legend . That much , even now , I will acknowledge . . . his divinity , however , was and is the work of others , shaped and directed by the race 's recurrent need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain relief , and he spoke in specific terms of what he believed and what I should write in his name . It was not until after dinner that we got around , all three of us , to a problem which was soon to absorb us all , with near-disastrous results . We had been talking amiably of neutral things and Cave had emerged somewhat from his earlier despondency . He got on to the subject of the farm where we were , of its attractivenessand remoteness , of its owner who lived in Spokane . " I always liked old Smathers . You 'd like him too . He 's got one of the biggest funeral parlors in the state . I used to work for him and then , when I started on all this , he backed me up to the hilt . Lent me money to get as far as San Francisco . After that of course it was easy . I paid him back every cent . " " Does he get here often ? " Cave shook his head . " No , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says he does n't approve of what I 'm doing . You see he 's Catholic . " " But he still likes John , " said Iris who had been stroking a particularly ugly yellow cat beside the fire . So it was John  |p116now  , I thought . Iris was the only person ever to call him by his first name . " Yes . He 's a good friend . " " There 'll be a lot of trouble , you know , " I said . " From Smathers ? " " No , from the Catholics , from the Christians . " " You really think so ? " Cave looked at me curiously . I believethat until that moment he had never realized the inevitablecollision of his point of view with that of the established religions . " Of course I do . They 've constructed an entire ethical systemupon a supernatural foundation whose main strength is the promise of a continuation of human personality after death . You are rejecting grace , heaven , hell , the Trinity . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris-tianity . " " But you 'll have to say something about it sooner or later . If  --  or rather when  --  the people begin to accept you , the churches will fight back and the greater the impression you make the more fierce their attack . " " I suspect John is the anti-Christ , " said Iris and I saw from her expression that she was perfectly serious . " He 's come to undo all the wickedness of the Christians . " " Though not , I hope , of Christ , " I said . " There 's some virtue in his legend , even as corrupted at Nicea three centuriesafter the fact . " " I 'll have to think about it , " said Cave . " I do n't know that I 've ever given it much thought before . I 've spoken always what I knew was true and there 's never been any opposition , at least that I 've been aware of , to my face . It never occurred to me that people who like to think of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . I know I do n't promise the kingdom of heaven but I do promiseoblivion and the loss of self , of pain ... " " Gene is right , " said Iris . " They 'll fight you hard . You must get ready now while you still have time to think it out ,  |p117before  Paul puts you to work and you 'll never have a moment'speace again . " " As bad as that , you think ? " Cave sighed wistfully . " But how to get ready ? What shall I do ? I never think things out , you know . Everything occurs to me on the spot . I can never tell what may occur to me next . It happens only when I speak to people . When I 'm alone , I seldom think of the .. . the main things ; yet , when I 'm in a group talking to them I hear . . . no , not hear , I feel voices telling me what I should say . That 's why I never prepare a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them taken down : they 're something which are meant only for the instant they are conceived . . . a child , if you like , made for just a moment 's life by the people listening and myself speaking . I do n't mean to sound touched , " he added , with a sudden smile . " I 'm not really hearing things but I do get something from those people , something besides the thing I tell them . I seem to become a part of them , as though what goes on in their minds also goes on in me , at the same time , two lobes to a single brain . " " We know that , John , " said Iris softly . " We 've felt it . " " I suppose , then , that 's the key , " said Cave . " Though it is n't much to write about ; you ca n't put it across without me to say it . " " You may be wrong there , " I said . " Of course in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , properly managed , everyone will accept it on the strength of evidence and statement , responding to the chain of forces you have set in motion . " Yet for all the glibness with which I spoke , I did not really believe that Cave would prove to be more than an interesting momentary phenomenon whose " truth " about death might , at best , contribute in a small way to the final abolition of those old warring superstitions which had mystified and troubled men for twenty dark centuries . A doubt which displayed my basic misunderstanding of our race 's will to death and , worse , to a death in life made radiant by false dreams , by desperate adjurations.  |p118But  that evening we spoke only of a bright future : " To begin again is the important thing , " I said . " Christianity , though strong as an organization in this country , is weak as a force because , finally , the essential doctrine is not accepted by most of the people : the idea of a man-like God dispensing merits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are small , " said Cave . " In space , on this tiny planet , we are nothing . Death brings us back to the whole . We lose this instant of awareness , of suffering , like spray in the ocean : there it forms . . . there it goes , back to the sea . " " I think people will listen to you because they realize now that order , if there is any , has never been revealed , that death is the end of personality even for those passionate , selfimportantI 's ' who insist upon a universal deity like themselves , carefully presented backwards in order not to give the game away . " " How dark , how fine the grave must be ! only sleep and an end of days , an end of fear : the end of fear in the grave as the I ' goes back to nothing . . . . " " How wonderful life will be when men no longer fear dying ! When the last superstitions are thrown out and we meet death with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer will children 's minds be twisted by evil , demanding , moralizing gods whose fantastic origin is in those barbarictribes who feared death and lightning , who feared life . That 's it : life is the villain to those maniacs who preach reward in death : grace and eternal bliss . . . or dark revenge . . . " Neither revenge nor reward , only the not-knowing in the grave which is the same for all . . . " " And without those inhuman laws , what societies we might build ! Take the morality of Christ . Begin there , or even earlier with Plato or earlier yet with Zoroaster . . . take the best ideas of the best men and should there be any disagreement as to what is best , use life as the definition , life as the measure : what contributes most to the living is the best . "  | " But the living is soon done and the sooner done the better . I envy those who have already gone . . . " " If they listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a prison . At first they may go wild but then , on their own , they will find ways to life . Fear and punishment in death has seldom stopped the murderer 's hand . The only two things which hold him from his purpose arc , at the worst , fear of reprisal from society and , at the best , a feeling for life , a love for all that lives . . . and not the wide-smiling idiot 's love but a sense of the community of the living , of life 's marvelous regency . . . even the most ignorant has felt this . Life is all while death is only the irrelevant shadow at the end , the counterpart to that instant before the seed lives . " Yes , I believed all that , all that and more too , and I felt Cave was the same as I ; by removing fear with that magic of his , he would fulfill certain hopes of my own and ( I flatter myself perhaps ) of the long line of others , nobler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use life more fully . And so that evening it welled up suddenly : the hidden convictionbehind a desultory life broke through that chill hard surface of disappointment and disgust which had formed a brittle carapace about my heart . I had , after all , my truth too , and Cave had got to it , broken the shell . . . and for that I shall remain grateful . . . until we arc at last the same , both taken by dust . Excitedly , we talked . . . I talked mostly , I think . Cave was the theme and I the counterpoint or so I thought . He had stated it and I built on it , built outward from what I conceived to be the luminosity of his vision . Our dialogue was one of communion , I believed and he believed too . Only Iris guessed , even then , that it was not . She saw the difference ; she was conscious of the division which that moment had , unknown to either of us , separated me from Cave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " death . " In true amity but false concord war began . Iris , more practical than we , deflated our visions by pulling the dialogue gently back to reality , to ways and dull means.  |p120It  was agreed that we had agreed on fundamentals , that the end of fear was desirable ; that superstition should be exorcised from human affairs ; that the ethical systems expressed by the major religious figures from Zoroaster to Mohammed all containeduseful and applicable ideas of societal behavior which need not be entirely discarded . At Iris 's suggestion , we left the problem of Christianity itself completely alone . Cave 's truth was sufficient cause for battle . There was no reason , she felt , for antagonizing the ultimate enemy at the very beginning . " Let them attack you , John . You must be above quarreling ; you must act as if they are too much in error even to notice . " I reckon I am above it , " said Cave and he sounded almost cheerful for the first time since my arrival . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to back down . I 'll just go on saying what I know . " At midnight , Cave excused himself and went to bed . Iris and I sat silently before the last red embers on the hearth . I sensed that something had gone wrong but I could not tell then what it was . When she spoke , her manner was abrupt : " Do you really want to go on with this ? " " What an odd time to ask me that . Of course I do . Tonight 's the first time I really saw what it was Cave meant , what it was I 'd always felt but never before known , consciously , that is . I could n't be more enthusiastic . " " I hope you do n't change . " " Why so glum ? What are you trying to say ? After all you got me into this . " " I know I did and I think I was right . It 's only that this evening I felt . . . well , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She smiled and , through all the youth and health , I saw that she was anxious and ill-at-ease . " That business about the accident ? " " Mainly , yes . The lawyers say that now that the old man 's all right he 'll try to collect damages . He 'll sue Cave . " " Nasty publicity . "  | " The worst . It 's upset John terribly . . . he almost feels it 's an omen . " " I thought we were dispensing with all that , with miracles and omens . " I smiled but she did not . " Speak for yourself . " She got up and pushed at the coals with the fire shovel . " Paul says he 'll handle everything but I do n't see how . There 's no way he can stop a lawsuit . " But I was tired of this one problem which was , all things considered , out of our hands in any case . I asked her about herself and Cave . " Is it wise my being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid not but that 's the way it is . " Her voice was hard and her back which was turned to me grew stiff , her movements with the fire shovel angry and abrupt . " People will use it against both of you . It may hurt him , and all of us . " She turned suddenly , her face flushed . " I ca n't help it , Gene . I swear I ca n't . I 've tried to keep away . I almost flew East with Clarissa but when he asked me to join him here , I did . I could n't leave him . " " Will marriage be a part of the new order ? " " Do n't joke . " She sat down angrily in a noise of skirts crumpling . " Cave must never marry . Besides it 's . . . it is n't like that . " " Really ? I must confess I .. . " " Thought we were having an affair ? Well , it 's not true . " The rigidity left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew visibly passive , even helpless , in the worn upholstered chair , her eyes on me , the anger gone and only weakness left . " What can I do ? " It was a cry from the heart . . . all the more touching because , obviously , she had not intended to tell me this . She 'd turned to me because there was no one else to whom she could talk . " You . . . love him ? " That word which whenever I spoke it in those days always stuck in my throat like a diminutive sob . " More , more , " she said distractedly . " But I ca n't do anything  |p122or  be anything . He 's complete . He does n't need anyone . He does n't want me except as . . . a companion , and advisor like you or Paul . . . it 's all the same to him . " " I do n't see that it 's hopeless . " " Hopeless ! " The word shot from her like a desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not weep . I sat awkwardly , inadequately watching her . The noise of a clock alone separated us : its dry ticking kept the silence from falling in about our heads . Finally , she dropped her hands and turned toward me with her usual grace . " You mus n't take me too seriously , " she said . " Or I must n't take myself too seriously which is more to the point . Cave does n't really need me or anyone and we . . . I , perhaps you , certainly others , need him . It 's best no one try to claim him all as a woman would do , as I might , given the chance . " She rose . " It 's late and you must be tired . Do n't ever mention to anyone what I 've told you tonight . . . especially to John . If he knew the way I felt . . . . " She left it at that . I gave my promise and we went to our rooms . I stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuallyreferred to the accident : he was almost petulant , as though the whole business were an irrelevant , gratuitous trick played on him by a malicious old man . His days were spent reading his mail ( there was quite a bit of it even then ) , composing answers which Iris typed out for him , and walking in the wooded hills which surrounded the farm on two sides . The weather was sharp and bright and the wind , when it blew , tasted of ice from the glaciers in the vivid mountains : winter was nearly with us and red leaves decorated the wind , so many ribbons for so much summer color . Only the firs remained unchanged , warm and dark in the bright chill days . Cave and I would walk together while Iris remained indoors , working . He was a good walker , calm , unhurried , sure-footed , and he knew all the trails beneath the yellow and red leaves fallen . Cave agreed with me on most of my ideas concerning the  |p123introduction  ; and I promised to send him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . He was genuinely indifferent to the philosophicaspect of what he preached . He acted almost as if he did not want to hear of those others who had approached the great matter in a similar way . When I talked to him of the fourthcenturyDonatists who detested life and loved heaven so much that they would request strangers to kill them , magistrates to execute them for no crime , he stopped me : " I do n't want to hear all that . That 's finished . All that 's over . We want new things now . " Iris , too , seemed uninterested in any formalizing of Cave 's thought though she saw its necessity and wished me well , suggestingthat I not ever intimate derivation since , in fact , there had been none : what he was , he had become on his own , uninstructed . During our walks , I got to know Cave as well as I was ever to know him . He was indifferent , I think , to everyone . He gave one his private time in precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work . With groups , with the masses , he was another creature : warm , intoxicating , human , yet transcendent. . . a part of each human being who beheld him at such times , the longed-for complement to the common soul . Yet though I found him , as a human being , without much warmth or intellectual interest I nevertheless identified him with the release I 'd known in his presence and , for this new certainty of life 's value and of death 's irrelevance , I loved him . On the third day I made up my mind to go back East and do the necessary writing in New York , away from Paul 's hectic influence and Cave 's advice . Cave asked me to stay with him for the rest of the week but I could see that Iris regarded me now as a potential danger , a keeper of secrets who might , despite promises , prove to be disloyal ; and so , to set her mind at ease as well as to suit my own new plans , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were for a moment alone in the study , that I had said nothing to Cave , that I was ready to go back that evening if she would drive me to Spokane . " You 're a good friend , " she said . " I made a fool of myselfp124the other night . I wish you 'd forget it . . . forget everything I said . " " I ' 11 never mention it . Now , the problem is how I can leave here gracefully . Cave just asked me this morning to stay on and . . . " But I was given a perfect means of escape . Cave came running into the room , his eyes shining . " Paul ! I 've just talked to Paul in L.A. It 's all over ! No heirs , nothing , no lawsuit . No damages to pay . " " What 's happened ? " Iris stopped him in his excitement . " The old man 's dead ! " " Oh Lord ! " Iris went gray . " That means a manslaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because of the accident . He was in anotheraccident . A truck hit him the day after he left the hospital . Yesterday . He was killed instantly . . . lucky devil : and of course we 're in luck too . " " Did they find who hit him ? " I asked , suddenly suspicious . Iris looked at me fiercely . She had got it too . " No . Paul said it was a hit-and-run . He said this time the police did n't find who did it . Paul said his analyst calls it a will to disaster ' . . . he wanted to be run over . Of course that 's hardly a disaster but the analyst thinks the old way . " I left that afternoon for New York , leaving Cave jubilantly making plans for the New Year : everything was again possible . Neither Iris nor I mentioned what we both knew . . . each of us , in our different way , accommodating the first of many crimes , as we drove across the smoky hills to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the unction , all the earnest turgidity of a theologian . You are perfect . " Clarissa beamed at me wickedly over lunch in the Plaza Hotel . We sat at a table beside a great plate-glass window through which we could see the frosted bleak expanse of Central Park , dingy in city snow , ringed by buildings like so many mountain peaks , monotonous in their sharp symmetry . The sky was sullen , gray with more snow to fall . The year was nearly over . " I thought it really quite to the point , " I said loftily but with an anxious look at the thin black volume between us which was that day to be published . The hasty work of one hectic month released in record time by a connection of Paul Himmell 's . " It 's pure nonsense , your historical part . I know , though I confess I was never one for the philosophers in those days . . dreary egotistical men , worse than the actors and not half so lovely . Waiter , I will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have it too . It 's light . " I ordered pot-de-creme , the heaviest dessert on the menu .  | " I 've made you angry , " Clarissa pretended contrition . " I was only trying to compliment you . What I meant was that the sort of thing you 're doing I think is nonsense only because action is what counts , action on any level . . . not theorizing . " There 's a certain action to thinking , you know , even to writing about the thoughts of others . " " Oh , darling , do n't sound so stuffy . Your dessert , by the way , poisons the liver . Oh , is n't that Bishop Winston over there by the door , in tweed ? In mufti , eh , Bishop ? " The Bishop , who was passing our table in the company of a handsomely pale youth whose contemplation of orders shone in his face like some cherished sin , stopped and , with a smile , shook Clarissa 's hand . " Ah , how are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She told me you 've been engaged in social work . " " A euphemism , Bishop . " Clarissa introduced me and the prelate moved on to his table , a robust gray-haired man with good coloring and a look of ease . " Catholic ? " " No , Episcopal . I like them the best , I think . They adore society and good works . . . spiritual Whigs you might call them , a civilizing influence . Best of all , so few of them believe in God , unlike the Catholics or those terrible Calvinist peasantswho are forever saving themselves and damning others . " " I think , Clarissa , you 're much too hard on the Episcopalians . I 'm sure they must believe what they preach . At least the clergy do . " " Well , we shall probably never know . Social work ! I knew Agnes would come up with something altogether wrong . Still , I 'm just as glad it 's not out yet . Not until the big debut tomorrow afternoon . I hope you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Then come to my place and we 'll see it together . Cave 's asked us both to the station , by the way , but I think it better if we not distract him . " " Iris came East with him ? "  | " Indeed she did . They both arrived last night . I thought you 'd talked to her . " " No . I have n't been in touch with either of them since I got back to New York . Paul 's the only one I ever see . " " He keeps the whole thing going , I must say . One of those born organizers . Now ! what about you and Iris ? " This came so suddenly , without preparation , that it took me a suspiciously long time to answer , weakly : " I do n't know what you mean . What about Iris and me ? " " Darling , I know everything . " She looked at me in her eager , predatory way : I was secretly pleased that , in this particular case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " You 're in love with her and she 's classically involved with Cave . " " Classical seems to be the wrong word . Nothing has happenedand nothing will happen . " " I suppose she told you this herself . " I was trapped for a moment . Clarissa , even in error , was shrewd and if one was not on guard she would quickly cease to be in error , at one 's expense . " No , not exactly ; but Paul who does , I think , know everythingabout our affairs assures me that nothing has happened , that Cave is not interested in women . " " In men ? " " I thought you were all-knowing . No , not in men nor in wild animals nor , does it seem , from the evidence Paul 's collected , in anything except John Cave . Sex does not happen for him . " " Oh , " said Clarissa , exhaling slowly , significantly , inscrutably . She abandoned her first line of attack to ask : " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I 'd intended , you know , when I brought you two together . " " I thought it was to bring me into Cave 's orbit . " " That , too , but somehow I saw you and Iris . . . well , you 're obviously going to give me no satisfaction so I shall be forced to investigate on my own . "  | " Not to sound too auctorial , too worried , do you think it will get Cave across ? the introduction here ? " " I see no reason why not . Look at the enormous success of those books with titles like Eternal Bliss Can Be Yours for the Asking ' or Happiness at Your Beck-and-Call . ' " " I 'm a little more ambitious . " " Not in the least . But the end served is the same . You got down the main line of Cave 's thinking , if it can be called thinking . And your book , along with his presence , should have an extraordinary effect . " " Do you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indeed I do . They are waiting . . . all those sad millions who want to believe will find him exactly right for their purposes . He exists only to be believed in . He 's a natural idol . . . did you know that when Constantine moved his court to the East , his heirs were trained by Eastern courtiers to behave like idols and when his son came in triumph back to Rome ( what a day that was ! hot , but exciting ) he rode for hours through the crowded streets without once moving a finger or changing expression , a perfectly trained god . We were all so impressed ... " I cut this short . " Has it occurred to you that they might not want to believe anything , just like you and me . " " Nonsense . . . and it 's rude to interrupt , dear , even a garrulous relic like myself . . . yet after all , in a way , we do believe what Cave says . Death is there and he makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And dying does rather upset a lot of people . Have you noticed one thing that the devoutly superstitious can never understand is the fact that though we do not accept the fairy tale of reward or punishmentbeyond the grave we still are reluctant to pass on , ' as the nuts say ? As though the prospect of nothing is n't really , in a way , without friend Cave to push one into acceptance , perfectlyghastly , much worse than toasting on a grid like that poor saint up north . But now I must fly . Come to the apartmentat seven and I 'll give you dinner . He 's on at eight . Afterwards they 'll all join us . " Clarissa flew.  |p129I  spent the afternoon gloomily walking up and down Fifth Avenue filled with doubt and foreboding , wishing now that I had never lent myself to the conspiracy , confident of its failure and of the rude laughter or , worse , the tactful silence of friends who would be astonished to find that after so many years of promise and reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obscure evangelist whose only eminence was that of having mesmerized myself and an energetic publicist , among a number of others more likely perhaps than we , to take to a crank . The day did nothing to improve my mood and it was in a most depressed state that I went finally to Clarissa 's baroque apartment on one of the better streets and dined with her quietly , infecting her , I was darkly pleased to note , with my own grim mood . By the time Cave was announced on the vast television screen , I had reduced Clarissa , for one of the few times in our acquaintance , to silence . Yet as the lights in the room mechanically dimmed , as the screen grew bright with color and an announcer came into focus , I was conscious of a quickening of my pulse , of a certain excitement . Here it was at last , the result of nearly a year 's careful planning . Soon , in a matter of minutes , we would know . To ' my surprise Paul Himmell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following half hour had been bought by Cavite , Inc . Paul spoke briefly , earnestly . He was nervous , I could see , and his eyes moved from left to right disconcertingly as he read his introduction from cards out of view of the camera . He described Cave briefly as a teacher , as a highly regarded figure in the West . He implied it was as a public service , the rarest of philantrophies , that a group of industrialists and businessmen were sponsoring Cave this evening . Then Paul walked out of range of the camera leaving , briefly , a view of a chair and a table behind which a handsomeblue velvet curtain fell in rich graceful folds from thep130invisible ceiling to an imitation marble floor . An instant later , Cave walked into view . Both Clarissa and I leaned forward in our chairs tensely , eagerly , anxiously : we were there as well as he . This was our moment too . My hands grew cold and my throat dry . Cave was equal to the moment . He looked tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly right . He wore a dark suit and a dark unfigured tie with a white shirt that gave him an austereness which , in person , he lacked . I saw Paul 's stagemanagingin this . He moved easily into range , his eyes cast down . Not until he had placed himself in front of the table and the camera had squarely centered him , did he look up , look directly into the lens . Clarissa gasped and I felt suddenly pierced : the camera , the lights had magnified rather than diminished his power . It made no difference now what he said . The magic was working . Clarissa and I sat in the twilight of her drawing room , entirely concentrated on that vivid screen , on the dark figure upon rich blue , on the pale eyes and the hands which seldom moved . It was like some fascinating scene in a skillful play which , quite against one 's wish and aesthetic judgment , pulled one to it , became , at least for that short time beyond real time , a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpened by artifice , by calculated magic . Not until Cave was nearly finished did those first words of his , spoken so easily , so quietly , begin to come back to me as he repeated them in his coda . His voice increasing a little in volume , yet still not hurrying , not forcing , not breaking the mood which his first glance had created and which voice and eyes together maintained without once letting go . The burden of his words was , as always , the same . Yet this time it seemed more awesome , more final , undeniable . . . in short , the truth . Though I 'd always accepted his first premise , I had never been much impressed by the ways he found of stating it , even though I always responded to his particular power . This night , before the camera and in the sight of millions ,  |p131he  perfected his singular art of communication and the world was his . When he finished , Clarissa and I sat for a moment in complete silence , the chirping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last she said : " The brandy is over there on the console . Get me some . " Then she switched off the screen from her chair and the lights of the room brightened again . " I feel dragged through a wringer , " she said after her first mouthful of brandy . " I had no idea it would work so well , like this , on television . " I felt strangely empty , let down . There was hardly any doubt now of Cave 's effectiveness yet I felt joyless and depleted , as though part of my life had gone , leaving an ache . " What a time we 're going to have . " Clarissa was beginning to recover . " I 'll bet there are a million letters by morning and Paul will be doing a jig . " " I hope this is the right thing , Clarissa . It would be terrible if it were n't . " " Of course it 's right . . . whatever that means : if it works it 's right . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion anyway . One year women expose only their ankle ; the next year their derriere . What 's right one year is wrong the next . If Cave captures the popular imagination , he 'll be right until someone better comes along . " " A little cynical . " But Clarissa was only repeating my own usual line . I was , or had been until that night on the Washingtonfarm , a contented relativist . Cave , however , had jolted me into new ways and I was bewildered by the change , by the prospect ahead . That evening was a time of triumph , at least for Cave 's companions . They arrived noisily . Paul seemed drunk , manically exhilirated , while Iris glowed in a formal gown of green shot with gold . Two men accompanied them , one a doctor whose name I did n't catch at first and the other a man from thep132television network who looked wonderfully sleek and pleased and kept patting Cave on the arm every now and then , as if to assure himself he 'd not vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dark suit , was mute . He sat answeringquestions and replying to compliments with grave nods of his head . He sat in a high brocaded chair beside the fire and drank tea which Clarissa , knowing his habits , had ordered in advance for him . After our first burst of greetings at the door I did not speak to Cave again and soon the others left him alone and talked around him , about him yet through him , as though he had become invisible . . . which seemed the case when he was not speaking , when those extraordinary eyes were veiled or cast down , as they were now , moodily studying the teacup , the pattern in the Aubusson rug at his feet . I crossed the room to where Iris sat on the wide couch . The doctor , in the chair close to her , snuffled brandy and said , as I joined them : " Your little book , sir , is written in a complete ignorance of Jung and all those who have come after him . " This was sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had not intended a treatise on psychoanalysis . " Not the point , sir , if you 'll excuse me .. . I am a psychiatrist , a friend of Mr Himmell 's " ( so this was the analyst to whom Paul so often referred ) " and I think it impossible for anyone today to write about the big things without a completeunderstanding of post-Jungian development . . . " Iris interrupted as politely as possible . " Doctor Stokharin is a zealot , Gene . You must listen to him but , first , did you see John tonight ? " " I did , here with Clarissa : he was remarkable , even more so than in person . " It is the isolation , " said Stokharin , nodding . Dandruff fell lightly like dry snow from his thick brows to his dark blue lapels . " The camera separates him from everyone else . He is projected like a dream into . . . " " He was so afraid at first , " said Iris , glancing across the room at the silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p133brocaded  chair , the teacup still balanced on one knee . " I 've never seen him disturbed by anything before . They tried to get him to do a rehearsal but he refused . He ca n't do rehearsals . . . only the actual thing . " " Fear is natural when . . . " but Stokharin was in the presence of a master drawing-room tactician : Iris was , I saw at that moment , a born hostess . For all her case and simplicity she was ruthlessly concerned with keeping order , establishing a rightness of tone which Doctor Stokharin , in his professional madness , would have completely undone , reducing the drawingroom to a seminar in mental therapy , receiving public confessions judiciously , and generalizing to a captive audience . I admired Iris 's firmness , her devotion to the civilized . " At first we hardly knew what to do . " Iris 's voice rose serenelyover the East European rumblings of the doctor . " He 'd always made such a point of the audience . He needed actual people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendly audience but John said no . He 'd c 'd try it without . When the talk began there were only a half dozen of us there : Paul , myself , and the technicians . No one else . " " How did he manage ? " " It was the camera . He said when he walked out there he had no idea if anything would happen or not , if he could speak . Paul was nearly out of his mind with terror ; we all were . Then John saw the lens of the camera . I is said looking into it gave him a sudden shock , like a current of electricity passing through him , for there , in front of him , was the eye of the world and the microphone above his head was the ear into which at last he could speak . When he finished , he was transfigured . I 've never seen him so excited . Ile could n't recall what he had said but the elation remained until . .. " " Until he got here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's been under a terrible strain these last two weeks . " " It 'll be nothing like the traumatizing shocks in store for him during the next few days , " said Stokharin , rubbing the bole of a rich dark pipe against his nose to bring out its luster ( the pipe 's luster , for the nose , straight , thick , proud , already shone like a gross baroque pearl ) . " Mark my words , everyone will be eager to see this phenomenon . When Paul first told me about him , I said , ah , my friend , you have found that father image for which you 've searched since your own father was run over by a bus in your ninth ( the crucial ) year . Poor Paul , I said , you will be doomed to disappointment . The wish for the father is the sign of your immaturity . For a time you find him here , there . . . in analysis you transfer to me . Now you meet a spellbinder and you turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that I talked to him . Believe me , I hold back nothing . Then I met this Cave . I watched him . Ah , what an analyst he would have made ! What a manner , what power of communication : a natural healer . If only we could train him . Miss Mortimer , to you I appeal . Get him to study . The best people , the post-Jungians are all here in New York . They will train him . He would become only a lay analyst but , even so , what miracles he could perform , what therapy ! We must not waste this native genius . " " I 'm afraid , Doctor , that he 's going to be too busy wasting himself to study your . . . procedures , " Iris smiled , engagingly , dislike apparent in her radiant eyes . Stokharin , however , was not sensitive to hostility . . . no doubt attributing such emotions to some sad deficiency in the other 's adjustment . Iris turned to me . " Will you be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Cave 's here ? Yes . I would n't miss it for anything . " " I 'm glad . I 've so much I want to talk to you about . So many things are beginning to happen . Call me tomorrow . I 'll be stayingat my old place . It 's in the book . " " Cave ? " " Is staying with Paul , out on Long Island at someone 's house . We want to keep him away from pests as much as possible . " " Manic depression , I should say , " said Stokharin thoughtfully , his pipe now clenched between his teeth and his atten/tion on Cave 's still figure . " With latent schizoid tendencies which . . . Miss Mortimer , you must have an affair with him . You must marry him if necessary . Have children . Let him see what it is to give life to others , to live in a balanced ... " " Doctor , you are quite mad , " said Iris and she crossed the room , cool in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as I could : " False modesty , inhibited behavior , too early bowel training , " and similar phrases ringing in my ears . Paul caught me at the door . I 'd intended to slip away without saying good night , confident that Clarissa would understand , that the others would not notice . " Not going so soon , are you ? " He was a little drunk , his face scarlet with excitement . " But you ought to stay and celebrate . " I murmured something about having an early appointment the next day . " Well , see me tomorrow . We 've taken temporary offices in the Empire State Building . The money has begun to roll in . If this thing tonight turns out the way I think it has , I 'm going to be able to quit my other racket for good and devote all my time to Cave . " Already the name Cave had begun to sound more like that of an institution than of a man . " By the way , I want to tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tried it out on several highbrowfriends of mine and they liked it . " " I 'm afraid ... " " That , together with the talks on television , should put this thing over with the biggest bang in years . We 'll probably need some more stuff from you , historical background , rules and regulations , that kind of thing , but Cave will tell you what he wants . We 've hired a dozen people already to take care of the mail and inquiries . There 's also a lecture tour being prepared , all the main cities , while . . . " " Paul , you 're not trying to make a religion of this , are you ? " I could hold it back no longer even though both time and occasion were all wrong for such an outburst . " Religion ? Hell , no . . . but we 've got to organize . We 've  |p136got  to get this to as many people as we can . People have started looking to us ( to him , that is ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clarissa 's maid ushered in a Western Union messenger , laden with telegrams . " Over three hundred , " said the boy . " The station said to send them here . " Paul paid him jubilantly and , in the excitement , I slipped away . The results of the broadcast were formidable . My small book which until then had enjoyed the obscurity of being briefly noted among the recent books was taken up by excited editors who used it as a basis for hurried but exuberant accounts of the new marvel . One night a week for the rest of that winter Cave appeared before the shining glass eye of the world and on each occasion new millions in all parts of the country listened and saw and pondered this unexpected phenomenon , the creation of their own secret anxieties and doubts , a central man . The reactions were too numerous for me to recollect in any order or with any precise detail ; but I do recall the first few months vividly : after that of course the work moved swiftly of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way casualties late in a large war do , not wringing the wearied heart as the death of one or a particular few might earlier have done . A few days after the first broadcast , I went to see Paul at the offices which he had taken in the Empire State Building . . . as high up as possible , I noted with amusement : always the maximum , the optimum . Halfway down a corridor , between lawyers and exporters , Cavite , Inc. was discreetly identified in black upon a frostedglassdoor . I went inside . It appeared to me the way I 'd always thought a newspaper office during a crisis might look . Four rooms opening in a row  |p137off  one another , all with doors open , all crowded with harassed secretaries and clean-looking young men in blue serge suits carrying papers , talking in loud voices which together made the room sound like a hive at swarming time . Though none of them knew me , no one made any attempt to ask my business or to stop me as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everywhere there were placards with Cave 's picture on them , calm and gloomy-looking , dressed in what was to be his official costume : a dark suit , an unfigured tie , a white shirt . I tried to overhear conversations as I passed the busy desks and groups of excited debaters , but their noise was too loud . Only one word was identifiable , sounding regularly , richly emphatic like a cello note : Cave , Cave , Cave . In each room I saw piles of my Introduction which pleased me even though I had come already to dislike it . The last room contained Paul , seated behind a desk with a dictaphone in one hand , three telephones on his desk ( none fortunately ringing at this moment ) and four male and female attendants with notebooks and pencils eagerly poised . Paul sprang from his chair when he saw me . The attendants fell back . " Here he is ! " He grabbed my hand and clung to it viselike : I could almost feel the energy pulsing in his fingertips , vibrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two to my every one . " Team , this is Eugene Luther . " The team was properly impressed and one of the girls , slovenly but intelligent-looking , said : " It was you who brought me here . First you I mean . . . and then of course Cave . " I murmured vaguely and the others told me how clear I had made all philosophy in the light of Cavesword . ( I believe it was that day , certainly that week , Cavesword was coined by Paul to denote the entire message of John Cave to the world ) . Paul then shooed the team out with instructions he was not to be bothered . The door , however , was left open . " Well , what do you think of them ? " He leaned back , beamingat me from his chair.  | " They seem very . . . earnest , " I said , wondering not only what I was supposed to think but , more to the point , what I did think of the whole business . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've never seen anything like it . The thing 's bigger even than that damned crooner I handled . . . you may remember the one . Everyone has been calling up and , look ! " He pointed to several bushel baskets containing telegrams and letters . " This is only a fraction of the response since the telecast . From all over the world . I tell you , Gene , we 're in . " " What about Cave ? Where is he ? " " He 's out on Long Island . The press is on my tail trying to interview him but I say no , no go , fellows , not yet ; and does that excite them ! We 've had to hire guards at the place on Long Island just to keep them away . " " How is Cave taking it all ? " " In his stride , absolute model of coolness which is more than I am . He agrees that it 's better to keep him under wraps while the telecasts are going on . It means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at this . " He showed me a proof sheet of a tabloid story : " Mystery Prophet Wows TV Audience , " with a photograph of Cave taken from the telecast and another one showing Cave ducking into a taxi , his face turned away from the camera . The story seemed most provocative and , for that complacent tabloid , a little bewildered . " Coming out Sunday , " said Paul with satisfaction . " There 's also going to be coverage from the big circulation media . They 're going to cover the next broadcast even though we said nobody 'd be allowed on the set while Cave was speaking . " He handed me a bundle of manuscript pages bearing the title " Who Is Cave ? " " That 's the story I planted in one of the slick magazines . Hired a name-writer , as you can see , to do it . " The name-writer 's name was not known to me but , presumably , it would be familiar to the mass audience . " And , biggest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already and we 've taken Dumaine Chemicals . They 're paying  |p139us  enough money to underwrite this whole setup here , and pay for Cave and me as well . It 's terrific but dignified . Just a simple through the courtesy of ' at the beginning and another at the end of each telecast . What do you think of that ? " " Unprecedented ! " I had chosen my word some minutes before . . . one which would have a cooling effect . " I 'll say . By the way , we 're getting a lot of stuff on that book of yours . " He reached in a drawer and pulled out a manila folder which he pushed toward me . " Take them home if you like . Go over them carefully . . . might give you some ideas for the next one ; you know : ground which needs covering . " Is there to be a next one ? " " Man , a flock of next ones ! We 've got a lot to do , to explain . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the kids out in the front office do a breakdown on all the letters we 've got : to get the general reaction . . . what it is people most want to hear ; and , believe mc , we 've been getting more damned questions , and not just the main thing but family problems too , things like that : Please , Mr Cave , I 'm married to two men and feel maybe it 's a mistake since I have to work nights anyway . ' Lord , some of them are crazier than that . " " Are you answering all of them ? " " Oh , yes , but in my name . All except a few of the most interesting which go to Cave for personal attention . I 've been toying with the idea of setting up a counselor-service for people with problems . " " But what can you tell them ? " I was more and more appalled . " Everything in the light of Cavesword . You have no idea how many questions that does answer . Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But of course we follow standard psychiatric procedure only it 's speeded up so that after a couple of visits there can be a practical and inspirational answer to their problems . Stokharin said he 'd be happy to give it a try , but we have n't yet worked out all the details . "  |p140I  did n't want to hear anything more about this ; I changed the subject . " What did you have in mind for me to do ? " " Caveswood applied to everyday life . " He after a few more telecasts , after more letters and so on . Then supply Caveswood where you can and , where you ca n't , just use common sense and standardpsychiatric procedure . " " Even when they do n't always coincide ? " Paul roared with laughter . " Always the big knocker , Gene . That 's what I like about you . . . the disapproving air .. . it 's wonderful and I 'm quite serious . People like myself .. . visionaries , you might say , continually get their feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull us back . . . make us think . Anyway , I hope you 'll be able to get to it soon . We 'll have our end taken care of by the time the telecasts are over . " Will you show Cave to the world then ? I mean in person ? " " I do n't know . By the way , we 're having a directors ' meeting Friday morning . You 'll get a notice in the mail . One of the things we 're going to take up is just that problem , so you be thinking about it in the meantime . I have a hunch it may be smart to keep him away from interviewers for good . " " That 's impossible . " " I 'm not so sure . He 's pretty retiring except when he speaks . I do n't think he 'd mind the isolation one bit . You see how dull he gets in company when he 's not performing . " " Would he consent , do you think ? " " I think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , for now he 's a mystery man . Millions see him once a week but no one knows him except ourselves . A perfect state of affairs , if you ask me . " " You mean there 's always a chance he might make a fool of himself if a tough interviewer got hold of him ? " " Exactly , and believe me there 's going to be a lot of them after his scalp . " " Have they begun already ? "  | " Not yet . We have you to thank for that , too , making it so clear that though what we said certainly conflicts with all the churches we 're really not competing with them , that people listening to Caveswood can go right on being Baptists and so on . " I do n't see how , if they accept Cave . " " Neither do I , but for the time being that 's our line . " " Then there 's to be a fight with the churches ? " Paul nodded grimly . " And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the supernatural junk seriously these days but they do go for the social idea of the church , the uplift kind of thing : that 's where we 'll have to meet them , where we 'll have to lick them at their own game . " I looked at him for one long moment : I had of course anticipated something like this from the moment that Cave had become an organization and not merely one man talking . I had realized that expansion was inevitable : the rule of life is more life and of organization more organization , increased dominion . Yet I had not suspected Paul of having grasped this so clearly , using it so promptly to his , to our advanatge . The thought that not only was he cleverer than I had suspected but that he might , indeed , despite his unfortunate approach , be even cleverer than myself , disagreeably occurred to me . I had until then regarded myself as the unique intellectual of the Cavites , the one sane man among maniacs and opportunists : it seemed now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two , he alone possessed ambition and energy , qualitiesneither of which I possessed to any useful degree . " You mean this to be a religion , Paul ? " He smiled , " Maybe , yes . . . something on that order perhaps . Something workable , though , for now : I 've thought about what you said the other night . " " Does Cave want this ? " Paul shrugged . " Who can tell . I should think so but this is not really a problem for him to decide . He has happened . Now we respond . Stokharin feels that a practical faith , a belief in ways of behavior which the best modern analysts are agreedp142on as being closest to ideal , might perform absolute miracles . No more guilt-feeling about sex if Cave were to teach that all is proper when it does no harm to others . . . and the desire to do harm to others might even be partly removed if there were no false mysteries , no terrible warnings in childhood and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work wonders ! Of course there would still be problems but the main ones could be solved if people take to Cave and to us . Cavesword is already known and it 's a revelation to millions . . . we know that . Now they are looking to him for guidance in other fields . They know about death at last . Now we must tell them about living and we are lucky to have available so much first-rate scientific research in the human psyche . I suspect we can even strike on an ideal behavior pattern by which people can measurethemselves . " " And to which they will be made to conform ? " Direction was becoming clear already . " How can we force anyone to do anything ? Our whole power is that people come to us , to Cave voluntarily because they feel here , at last , is the answer . " Paul might very well have been sincere : there is no way of determining , even now . " Well , remember , Paul , that you will do more good than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new dogmas . It will be the same in the end except that the old is less militant , less dangerous than a new law imposed by enthusiasts . " " Do n't say you . ' Say we . ' You 're as much a part of this as I am . After all you 're a director . You 've got a say-so in these matters . Just speak up Friday . " Paul was suddenly genial and placating . " I do n't pretend I 've got all the answers . I 'm just talking off the top of my head , like they say . " A member of the team burst into the office with the news that Bishop Winston was outside . " Now it starts , " said Paul with a grimace . The Bishop did not recognize me as we passed one another in the office . He looked grim and he was wearing clerical garb .  | " He 's too late , " said a lean youth , nodding at the churchman'sback . " Professional con-men , " said his companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And with that in my ears , I walked out into the snowswirlingstreet , into the bleak opening of the new year , of Cave 's year . I was more alainied than ever by what Paul had told me and by what I heard on every side . In drugstores and bars and restaurants , people talked of Cave . I could even tell when I did not hear the name that it was of him they spoke : a certain intentness , a great curiosity , a wonder . In the bookstores , copiesof my introduction were displayed with large blown-up photographs of Cave to accompany them . Alone in a bar on Madison Avenue where I 'd taken refuge from the cold , I glanced at the clippings Paul had given me . There were two sets . The first were the original perfunctory ones which had appeared , short , puzzled . . . the reviewers , knowing even less philosophy than I , tended to question my proposition that Caveswood was anything more than a single speculation in rather a large field . 1 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the testament of miracles , depends entirely on faith and to inspire faith one needed Cave himself . " What do you think about the guy ? " the waiter , a fragile sensitive Latin with parchment-lidded eyes mopped the spilled gin off my table ( he 'd seen a picture of Cave among my clippings ) . " It 's hard to say , " I said . " Flow did he strike you ? " " Boy , like lightning ! " The waiter beamed ; a smile which showed broken teeth spoiled the delicate line of his face . " Of course I 'm Catholic but this is something new . Some people been telling me you ca n't be a good Catholic and go for this guy . But why not ? I say . You still got Virginmerry and now you got him , too , for right now . You ought to see the crowd we get here to see the TV when he 's on . It 's wild . " It was wild , I thought , putting the clippings back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul had emphasizedmy directorship , my place in the structure . . . well , I would show them what should be done or , rather , not done . Then I went out into the snow-dimmed street and hailed a cab . All the way to Iris 's apartment I was rehearsing what I would say to Paul when next we met . " Leave them alone , " I said aloud . " It is enough to open the windows . " " Open the windows ! " The driver snorted . " It 's damn near forty in the street . " Iris occupied several rooms on the second floor of a brownstonein a street with , pleasantest of New York anachronisms , trees . When I entered , she was doing yogi exercises on the floor , sitting crosslegged on a mat , her slender legs in leotards and her face flushed with strain . " It just does n't work for me ! " she said and stood up without embarrassment for , since I 'd found the main door unlocked , I 'd opened this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Iris , the downstairs door was . .. " " Do n't be silly . " She rolled up the mat efficiently . " I was expecting you but I lost track of time . . . which means it must be working a little . I 'll be right back . " She went into the bedroom and I sat down , amused by this unexpected side to Iris : I wondered if perhaps she was a devotee of wheat germ and mint tea as well . She claimed not . " It 's the only real exerciseI get , " she said , changed now to a heavesrobe which completely swathed her figure as she sat curled up in a great armchair , drinking Scotch , as did I , the winter outside hid by drawn curtains , by warmth and light . " Have you done it long ? " " Oh , off and on for years . I never get anywhere but it 's very restful and I 've felt so jittery lately that anything which relaxesme. . . . " her voice trailed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to see Paul , " I began importantly.  | " Ah . " But I could not , suddenly , generate sufficient anger to speak out with eloquence . I went around my anger stealthily , a murderer stalking his victim . " We disagreed . " " In what ? " " In everything , I should say . " " That 's so easy with Paul . " Iris stretched lazily ; ice chatteredin her glass ; a car 's horn melodious and foreign sounded in the street below . " We need him . If it was n't Paul , it might be someone a great deal worse . At least be 's intelligent and devoted . That makes up for a lot . " " I do n't think so ; Iris , he 's establishing a sort of supermarket , short-order church for the masses . " She laughed delightedly . " I like that . . . and , in a way , you 're right : that 's what he would do left to himself . " " He seems in complete control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the decisions . " " I wish I could be sure of that . " " You 'll see on Friday . You 'll be at the meeting , wo n't you ? " I nodded . " I have a feeling that between Paul and Stokharinthis thing is going to turn into a world-wide clinic for mental health . " " I expect worse things could happen , but Paul must still contend with me and you and of course the final word is with John . " " How is Cave , by the way ? I have n't seen him since the night of the first telecast . " " Quite relaxed , unlike the rest of us . You should come out with me one day to Long Island and sec him . I go nearly every day for a few hours . He 's kept completely removed from everyone except the servants and Paul and me . " " Does he like that ? " " He does n't seem to mind . He walks a good deal . . . it 's a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ie reads a little , mostly detective stories . . . and then of course there 's the mail that Paul sends on . He works at that off and on all day . I help himp146and when we 're stuck ( you should see the questions ! ) we consult Stokharin who 's very good on some things , on problems ... " " And a bore the rest of the time . " " That 's right , " Iris giggled . " I could n't have been more furious the other night , but , since then , I 've seen a good deal of him and he 's not half bad . We 've got him over the idea that John should become a lay analyst : the response to the telecast finally convinced Stokharin that here was a racial ' folk-fatherfigure ' . . . his very own words . Now he 's out to educate the father so that he will fulfill his children 's needs on the best post-Jungian lines . " " Does Cave take him seriously ? " I1 " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who 's ever had the bad sense to lecture John . . . who absolutelyhates it ; but he does feel that Stokharin 's answers to some of the problems we 're confronted with are ingenious . All that . . . hints to the lovelorn is too much for John , so we need the Stokharins to take care of details . " " I hope he 's careful not to get too involved . " " John 's incorruptible . Not because he is so noble or constant but because he can only think a certain way and other opinions , other evidence , ca n't touch him . " I paused , wondering if this was true ; then : " I 'm going to make a scene on Friday . I 'm going to suggest that Paul is moving in a dangerous direction , toward organization and dogma and that if something is not done soofr-we 'll all be ruined by that which we most detest : a militant absolutist doctrine . " Iris looked at me curiously . " Tell me , Gene , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all of us when you so apparently suspect the general direction ? You 've always been perfectly clear about what you did not want ( I can recall , I think , every word you said at the farm that night ) but , to be specific , what would you like all this to become ? How would you direct things if you could ? "  |p147I  'd been preparing myself for such a question for several months yet I still had no single answer to make which would sharply express my own doubts and wishes . But I made an attempt . " I would not organize , for one thing . I 'd have Cave speak regularly , all he likes , but there would be no Cavite , Inc. , no Paul planting articles and propagandizing . I 'd keep just Cave , nothing more . Let him do his work . Then , gradually , there will be effects , a gradual end to superstition .... Iris looked at me intently . " If it were possible , , I would say we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruinous not only for us but for everyone . . . " " Why ruinous ? A freedom to come to a decision on one 's own without ... " " That 's it . No one can be allowed that freedom . One does n't need much scholarship or even experience to see that . Everywherepeople are held in check by stifling but familiar powers . People are used to tyranny : they expect governments to demand their souls , and they have given up decisions on many levels for love of security . What you suggest is impossiblewith this race at this time . " " You 're talking nonsense . After all , obeisance to establishedreligions is the order of the day , yet look at the response to Cave who is undermining the whole Christian structure . " " And wait until you see the fight they 're going to put up ! " said Iris grimly . " Fortunately , Cave 's word is the mortal blow though Cave himself would be their certain victim if he was protected , if there was no organization to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul and his  --  his team , his proselytes are to become merely an equivalent power , combating the old superstitions with their own weapons . " " More or less , yes . That 's what it has come to . " " Even though his talking to the people would be enough ? Let them use him , not he them . " " A good slogan , " Iris smiled . " But I think I 'm right . No  |p148one  would have a chance to see or hear him if it were n't for Paul ; you should read the threatening letters we 've been getting . " " I thought all the mail was most admiring ? " " All that came from people who 've actually heard him but there 's a lot coming in now from religious fanatics ' They are very extreme . And of course the churches , one by one , are starting to take notice . " " I saw Bishop Winston in Paul 's office today . " " He 's been trying to see John all week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , after the next telecast there will really be a storm . " " The next ? What 's going to happen then ? " " John will tell them that there 's no need for the churches , that their power derives from superstition and bloody deeds . " I was startled . " When did this hit him ? I thought he intended to go on as he was , without ever coming out openly against them . " " I was surprised too . He told me yesterday ; he 'd been broodingall day and , suddenly , he started to attack them . It 's going to be murderous . " " I hope not for him . " " Oh , he 'll convince , I 'm sure of that : but their revenge ... " She gave a troubled sigh . " Anyway , Gene , you do see why we ca n't , for our own safety , dispense with Paul and his financiers and press agents and all the squalid but necessary crew . " " It may be too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . " " No one can tell ; besides , as long as you and I are there with John it will be all right . " I felt her confidence was not entirely justified but I determined , for the moment , to defer my attack on Paul 's methods until a safer time . We argued about the wisdom of the coming telecast : was it really necessary to confront the enemy explicitly ? and in his own country , so to speak ? Iris was not sure , but she felt Cave'sp149instinct was right even though he had , perhaps , been goaded into action sooner than we 'd anticipated by the harsh letters of Christian zealots . And then by slow degrees , by careful circling , the conversationgrew personal . " I 've never told anyone else , " said Iris , looking at me speculatively . " Do n't worry ; I have n't repeated any of it . " And , as always at such times , I felt a warm flood of guilt : any direct statement of personal innocence has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've told you , I . . . it 's a relief to have someone I can talk to about John . I do n't dare mention his name to my family , to my old friends . . . I do n't think they even know yet that I 've met him . " " I thought it has all been in the papers . " " I have n't been mentioned but , after Friday , everyone will know . Paul says there 's no way for us to cluck inquiries . After the directors ' meeting he 'll issue a statement naming directors , stockholders and so on . " " But even then , why should anyone suspect you were interested in Cave or he in you ? l is possible merely to be a director , is n't it ? " Iris shrugged . " You know how people are . Clarissa keeps wanting to have what she calls a comfy chat about everything and I keep putting her off . Stokharin now takes it for granted that John and I sleep together , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " It had an odd ring to it and I laughed . " Do you think that 's a sound post-Jungian analysis ? " Iris smiled faintly . " Whatever it is , the feeling , such as it it , is all on my side . " " And he shows no sign of returning your affection ? " " None at all . He 's devoted to me , I think . He relies on my judgment . He trusts me , which is more than he does anyone else I know of . . . "  | " Even me ? " Always the " I " coming between me and what I wished to know : that insatiable , distressing " I. " " Yes , even you , dear , and Paul too . He 's on guard against everyone , but not in a nasty or suspicious way . He . . . what is the phrase ? he keeps his own counsel . " " And you are the counsel ? " In a sense , and nothing more . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . love was not possible for him . If so , it 's unwise for you to put yourself in such a position . . . harmful , too . " " But there 's still the other Cave . I love him as well and the two are , finally , the same . " " A metaphysique ? " " No , or at least I do n't see a paradox . It 's something else ; it 's like coming out of an illness with no past at all , only a memory of pain and dullness which soon goes in the wonderfulpresent . " " It ? " " My love is it . " Her voice grew strong . " I 've learned that in loving him I love life , which I never did before . Why , I can even value others now , value all those faceless creatures whom I knew without ever bothering to see , to bring in focus the dim blurs of all that world alive . I lived asleep . Now I am awake . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? It 's gone beyond that . I 'm no longer the scales most lovers are , weighing the deeds and gifts and treasures proffered against those received or stolen from the other , trying always to bring into fatal balance two separate imponderables . I give myself and what I take is life , the knowledge that there is another creature in the world whose wonder , to me at least , is all-satisfying by merely being . " " Is it so terrible to be alive ? " " Beyond all expectation , my poor friend . " And then I left her to return to winter , to the snow-filled streets and my old pain.  |p151The  second telecast had the anticipated effect . The day after , Friday , nearly a hundred thousand letters and telegrams had been received , and Cave 's life had been threatened four times over the telephone . I was awakened at five o'clock on Friday morning by a newspaperman begging an interview . Half-asleep , irritably , I told him to go to hell and hung up though not before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with hell . " This woke me up and I made coffee , still keeping my eyes half-shut in the dim winter light , hoping sleep might return to its accustomed perch ; but more telephone calls demoralized my fragile ally and I was left wide awake , unshaven , with fastbeatingheart beside the telephone , drinking coffee . Every few minutes there was a call from some newspaper man or editor requesting information : they had all been shocked by the telecast . When I told them they should get in touch with Cave himself , or at least with Paul 's office , they only laughed : thousands were trying to get to speak to Paul , tens of thousands to Cave ; the result was chaos . Shakily , I took the phone off its hook and got dressed . When I opened my door to get the morning paper , a thin young man leaped past me into my living room and anchored himself to a heavy chair . " What . . . " I began ; he was only too eager to explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ended , breathlessly , " the Star has authorized me to advance you not only that money but expenses , too , for an exclusive feature on Cave and the Cavitcs . " " I wish , " I said , very gentle in the presence of such enthusiasm , " that you would go away . It 's five in the morning ... " " You 're our only hope , " the boy wailed . " Every paper and news service has been trying to get past the gate out on Long Island for three weeks and failed . They could n't even shoot him at long range . " " Shoot him . "  | " Get a picture . Now please ... " " Paul Himmell is your man . He 's authorized to speak for Cave . He has an office in the Empire State Building and he keeps respectable hours ; so why do n't you ... " " We have n't been able to get even a release out of him for three days now . It 's censorship , that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're not the government . Cave is a private citizen and this is a private organization . If we choose not to give interviews you have no right to pester us . " " Oh , come off it . " The young man was at an age where the needs of ambition were often less strong than the desire for true expression ; for a moment he forgot that he needed my forbearance and I liked him better . " This is the biggest news that 's hit town since the war . You guys have got the whole country asking questions and the big one is : who is Cave ? " " There 'll be an announcement today , I think , about the company . As for Cave , I suggest you read a little book called An Introduction to ... " ' " Of course I 've read it . That 's why I 'm here . Now , please , Mr Luther , give me an exclusive even if you wo n't take the Star 's generous offer . At least tell me something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of coffee splattered from cup to saucer to the back of my hand : it dried stickily . I felt worn-out already , the day only just begun . " What do you want me to tell you ? What would you most like to hear ? What do you expect me to say since , being a good journalists that is what you 'll write no matter what I tell you ? " " Oh , that 's not true . I want to know what Cave 's all about as a person , as a teacher . " " Well , what do you think he 's up to ? " " Me ? Why . . . I do n't know . I never heard him on the air until last night . It was strong stuff . " " Were you convinced ? " " In a way , yes . He said a lot of things I agreed with but I was a little surprised at his going after the churches . Not that I like anything about them , but still it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of people . I mean you just do n't say those things any more , even if you do think them ' .. . ca n't offend minorities ; that 's what we learn first in journalism school . " " There 's part of your answer then : Cave is a man who , unlike others , says what he thinks is true even if it makes him unpopular . There 's some virtue in that . " " I guess he can afford to in his position , " said the boy vaguely . " You know we got Bishop Winston to answer him for the Star . Signed him last night after Cave went off the air . I 'm sure he 'll do a good job . Now . .. " We wrestled across the room ; since I was the stronger , I won my privacy though muffled threats of exposure were hurled at me from behind the now-bolted door . Acting on an impulse , I left the apartment as soon as I was sure my recent visitor had gone . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed home ; fears which were justified : according to the elevator man , lie had turned away several men already . The one who did get through had come up the fire escape . I walked quickly out into the quiet street , the snow now gone to slush as dingy as the morning sky . Fortunately , the day was neither windy nor cold and I walked to a Times Square automat for an early breakfast . I was reassured by anonymity . All around me sleepy men and women clutching newspapers , briefcases and lunch pails sat sullenly chewing their breakfast , sleep not yet departed . I bought a roll , more coffee , hominy grits which I detested in the North but occasionally tried in the hope that , by accident , I might stumble upon the real thing . These were not the real thing and I left them untouched while I read my paper . Cave was on the front page . Not prominent , but still he was there . The now-standard photograph looked darkly from the page . The headline announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There followed a paraphrase of the telecast which began with those fateful and soon to bep154famous words : " Our quarrel is not with Christ but with his keepers . " I wondered , as I read , if anyone had ever taken one of the telecasts down in shorthand and made a transcript of it . I , for one , should have been curious to see in cold print one of those sermons . Cave himself knew that without his presence they would not stand up and , consequently , he allowed none of them to be transcribed ; the result was that whenever there was a report of one of his talks it was , necessarily , paraphrased which gave a curious protean flavor to his doctrine , since the recorded style was never consistent , changing always with each paraphraser just as the original meaning was invariablyaltered by each separate listener as he adapted the incantationto his private needs . A fat yellow-faced woman sat down with a groan beside me and began to ravish a plate of assorted cakes . Her jaws grinding , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sleep and her body , incorrectly buttoned into a cigaretteash-dusteddress , was as still as a mountain , even the work of lungs was obscured by the torpid flesh . I watched her above the newspaper , fascinated by the regularity with which her jaws ground the bits of cake . Her eyes looked past me into some invisible world of pastry . Then , having finished the report on Cave 's telecast , I put the newspaper down and ate with deliberate finesse my own biscuit . The rustling of the newspaper as it was folded and placed on the table disturbed my companion and , beneath the fat , her will slowly sent out instructions to the extremities . She cleared her throat . Her head lowered . Her chewing stopped ; a bit of cake was temporarily lodged in one cheek , held firmly in place by a gaudy plate . Her eyes squinted at the newspaper . She spoke : " Something about that preacher fellow last night ? " " Yes . Would you like to see it ? " I pushed the paper toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the words of the headlines with heavy lips and deep irregular breaths . " Did you see him last night ? " she asked when her eye finallyp155got to the small print where it stopped , as though halted by a dense jungle . " Yes . As a matter of fact , I did . " " He sure gave it to them bastards , did n't he ? " Her face lit up joyously ; I thought of ca ira . " You mean the clergy ? " " That 's just what I mean . They had it too good , too long . People afraid to say anything . Takes somebody like him to tell us what we know and tell them where to head-in . " " Do you like what he said about dying ? " " About there being nothing ? Why , hell , mister , I knew it all along . " " But it 's good to hear someone else say it ? " " Do n't do no harm . " She belched softly . " I expect they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added with gloomy pleasure , spearing a fragment of eclair which she had missed on her first circuit of her crowded dish . I spent that morning in the street buying newspapers , eavesdropping . I heard several arguments about Cave : the religiously orthodox were outraged but clearly interested ; the others were triumphant though all seemed to feel that they , as the automat woman had said , would soon be on his tail . Ours was no longer a country where the nonconformist could escape disaster if he unwisely showed a strange face to the multitude . I tried to telephone Iris and then Clarissa but both telephoneswere reported busy ; I called the office but was told by a mechanical voice that if I left my name and address and business Mr. Himmell would call me as soon as possible . The siege had begun . I arrived at the Empire State Building half an hour before the meeting was to begin , hoping to find out in advance from Paul what was happening and what we were supposed to do about it . A picket line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , denouncing Cave and all his works in the names of various religious groups . A crowd was beginningp156to gather and the police , at least a score , moved frantically about , not knowing how to keep the mob out of the building . When I stepped off the elevator at Cave 's floor , I found myself a part of a loud and confused mass of men and women all shoving toward the door which was marked Cavite , Inc . Policemen barred their way . Long before I 'd got to the door , a woman 's shoe went hurtling through the air , smashing a hole in the frosted glass . One policeman cocked his revolver menacingly . Another shouted , " Get the riot squad ! " But still the crowd raved and shouted and quarreled . Some wanted to lynch Cave in the name of the Lamb , while others begged to be allowed to touch him , just once . I got to the door at last , thanks to a sudden shove which landed me with a crash into a policeman . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Business ! " I shouted with what breath was left me . " Got business here . Director . " I was not believed but , after some talk with a pale secretary through the shattered glass door , I was admitted . The crowd roared when they saw this and moved in closer . The door slammed shut behind me . " It 's been like this since nine o'clock , " said the secretary , looking at me with frightened eyes . " You mean after two hours the police still ca n't do any-thing ? " " We did n't call them right away . When we did it was too late . We 're barricaded in here . " The team sat about at their desks pretending to work , pretending not to notice the noise from the corridor . Paul , however , was not in the least disturbed . He was standing by the window in his office looking out . Clarissa , her hat and her hair together awry : a confusion of straw and veil and bolts of reddish hair apparently not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ravenous , wild beasts ! " she hailed me . " I 've seen their likes before . " -  " Gene , good fellow ! Got through the mob all right ? Here , have a bit of brandy . No ? Perhaps some Scotch ? " I said it was too early for me to drink . Shakily , I sat down . Paul laughed at the sight of us . " You both look like the end of the world has come . " " I 'd always pictured the end as being quite orderly .... " I began stuffily but Doctor Stokharin 's loud entrance interruptedme . His spectacles were dangling from one ear and his tie had been pulled around from front to back quite neatly . " No authority ! " he bellowed , ignoring all of us . " The absence of a traditional patriarch , the center of the tribe , has made them insecure . Only together do they feel warmth in great swarming hives ! " His voice rose sharply and broke on the word " hives " into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his clothes still disarranged . " My hair , " said Clarissa grimly , " may never come out right again today . " She put the mirror hack into her purse which she closed with a loud snap . " I do n't see , Paul , why you did n't have the foresight to call the police in advance and demand protection . " " I had no idea it would be like this . Believe me , Clarissa , it 's not deliberate . " But from his excited chuckling , I could see that he was delighted with the confusion . The triumph of the publicist 's dark art . I wondered if he might not have had a hand in it : it was a little reminiscent of the crowds of screaming women which in earlier decades , goaded by publicists , had howled and , as Stokharin would say , swarmed about singers and other theatrical idols . Paul anticipated my suspicions . " Did n't have a thing to do with it , I swear . Doctor , your tie is hanging down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Stokharin disagreeably , but he did adjust his glasses . " I 'd a feeling we 'd have a few people in to see us but no idea it would be like this . " He turned to me as the quietest , the least dangerous of the three . " You would n't believe the response to last night 's telecast if I told you . "  | " Why do n't you tell me ? " The comic aspects were becoming apparent : Stokharin 's assaulted dignity and the ruin of Clarissa'singenious hair both seemed to me suddenly funny ; I cleared my throat to obscure the tickling of a smile . Paul named some stupendous figures with an air of triumph . " And there are more coming all the time . Think of that ! " " Are they favorable ? " " Favorable ? Who cares ? " Paul was pacing the floor quickly , keyed to the breaking-point had he possessed the metabolism of a normal man . " We 'll have a breakdown over the weekend . Hired more people already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're moving . " " Not a moment too soon , " said Clarissa balefully . " I suggest , in fact , we move now while there are even these few policeto protect us . When they go home for lunch ( they all eat enormous lunches , one can tell ) , that crowd is going to come in here and throw us out the window . " " Or suffocate us with love , " said Paul . Stokharin looked at Clarissa thoughtfully ; with his turnedaroundnecktie he had a sacerdotal look . " Do you often think of falling from high places ? of being pushed from windows or perhaps high trees ? " " Only when I 'm on the top floor of the world 's highest building surrounded by raving maniacs do such forebodings occur to me , doctor . Had you a greater sense of reality you might be experiencing the same apprehension . " Stokharin clapped his hands happily . " Class* classic . To believe she alone knows reality . Madam , I suggest that you . . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glass shattering ; a revolver went off with a sharp report and , frozen with alarm , I waited for its echo : there was none ; only shouts of : Cave ! Cave ! Cave ! Surrounded by police , Cave and Iris were escorted into the office . More police held the door , aided by the office crew who , suddenly inspired , were throwing paper cups full of waterinto the crowd . Flash bulbs like an electric storm flared inp159all directions as the newspaper men invaded the office , let in by the police who could not hold them back . Iris looked frightened and even Cave seemed alarmed by the rioting . Once the police lieutenant had got Cave and Iris into the office , he sent his men back to hold the corridor . Before he joined them he said sternly , breathing hard from the struggle , " We 're going to clear the hall in the next hour . When we do we 'll come and get you people out of here . You got to leave whether you want to or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour is all we need , officer . " Paul was smooth . " And may I tell you that my old friend , the Commissioner , is going to hear some extremely nice things about the efficiency and good sense of his men . " Before the lieutenant had got around to framing a suitably warm answer , Paul had maneuvered him out of the inner office ; he locked the door behind him . " There , " he said , turning to us , very businesslike . " It was a mistake meeting here after last night . I 'm sorry , John . " " It 's not your fault . " Cave , having found himself an uncomfortablestraight chair in a corner of the room , sat very erect , like a child in serious attendance upon adults . " I had a hunch we should hold the meeting out on Long Island . " Paul scowled . " I hate the idea of the press getting a look at you . Spoils the mystery effect ; guess it was bound to happen , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , but I will , " said Cave easily , showing who was master here , this day . " But . . . well , after what we decided , the initial strategy being . . . " " No . It 's all changed now , Paul . I 'll have to face them , at least this once . I 'll talk to them the way I always talk . They 'll listen . " His voice grew dreamy . He was indifferent to Paul 's discomfiture . " Did you get a new place ? " asked Iris , suddenly , to divert the conversation . " What ? Oh yes . A whole house , five stories on East SixtyfirstStreet . Should be big enough . At least for now . " The  |p160inter-office  communicator sounded . Paul spoke quickly into it : " Tell the newspaper people to wait out there . We 'll have a statement in exactly an hour and they 'll be able . . . . " he paused and looked at Cave for some reprieve ; then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to interview Cave . " He flipped the machine off . Through the locked door , we heard a noise of triumph from the gathered journalists and photographers . " Well , come along , " said Clarissa , " I thought this was to be a board of directors meeting . Cave , dear , you 've got to preside . " But , though he said he 'd rather not , Clarissa , in a sudden storm of legality , insisted that he must : she also maliciously demanded a complete reading of the last meeting 's minutes by Paul , the secretary . We were able to save him by a move to waive the reading which was proposed , recorded and passed by a show of hands , only Clarissa dissenting . Cave conducted the meeting solemnly . Then Clarissa demanded a report from the treasurer and this time Paul was not let off . For the first time I had a clear picture of the company of which I was a director . Shares had been sold . Control was in the hands of Clarissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not familiar to me , also had shares . The main revenue of the company now came from the sponsor of Cave 's television show . There was also a trickle of contributions which , in the last few weeks , had increased considerably . Then Paul read from a list of expenses , his voice hurrying a little over his own salary which was , I thought , a bit large . Cave 's expenses were recorded and , with Clarissa goading from time to time , Paul gave an accounting of all that had been spent since the arrival in New York . John Cave was a big business . " The books are audited at standard intervals , " said Paul , looking at Clarissa as he finished , some of his good humor returning . " We will not declare dividends unless Mrs Lessing insists the company become a profit-making enterprise . "  | " It might not be a bad idea , " said Clarissa evenly . " Why not get a little return . . . " But Paul had launched into policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a suggestion . Iris and I made no comment . Stokharin occasionally chose to illuminate certain human problems as they arose and Paul , at least , heard him out respectfully . Clarissa wanted to know all about costs and her interruptions were always brief and shrewd . Several decisions were made at that meeting . It was decided that a Center be established and headed by 1 ) r . Stokharin to take care of those Cavites whose problems might be helped by therapy . " We just apply classical concepts to their little troubles , " he said . " But it should n't seem like a clinic , " said Iris suddenly . " It 's all part of John , of what John says . " " We 'll make that perfectly clear , " said Paul quickly . Stokharin nodded agreeably . " After all it is in his name they come to us . We take it from there . No more problems .. . all is contentment . " He smacked his lips . It was then decided that Cave would spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour of the country to be followed by more telecasts in the following winter . " The summer is to think a little in , " were Cave 's words . Next , I was assigned the task of writing a defense of Cave for certain vast syndicates ; I was also requested to compose a set of dialogues which would record Cave 's views on such problems as marriage , the family , world government and variousother problems all in urgent need of answering . I suggested , diffidently , that it would be very useful if Cave were to tell me what he thought about such things before I wrote my dialogues . Cave said , quite seriously , that we would have the summer in which to handle all these subjects . Paul then told us the bad news ; there was a good deal of it . " The Cardinal , in the name of all the Diocesan Bishops , has declared that any Catholic who observes the telecasts of John Cave or attends in person his blasphemous lectures commitsa grave and mortal sin . Bishop Winston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the press but that he is quite sure , if we continue , the government will intervene . It was a hint , and not too subtle . " " On what grounds intervene ? " asked Cave . " What have I done that breaks one of their laws ? " " They 'll trump up something , " said Clarissa . " I 'm afraid you 're right . They can always find something to get us on . So far , that is about the worst that can happen . " " But do you think it will ? " I asked . " Free speech is still on the books . " Paul chuckled grimly . " That 's just where it stays , too . " And he quoted the national credo : In a true democracy there is no place for a serious difference of opinion on truly great issues . " Sooner or later they 'll try to stop Cave . " " But they ca n't ! " said Iris . " The people wo n't stand for it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Stokharin sagely . " No son will rise to dispute him , yet . " " No use to get excited in advance . " Paul was reasonable . " Now let 's get a statement ready for the press . " While Paul and Cave worked over the statement , the rest of us chatted quietly about other problems . Stokharin was just about to explain the origin of alcoholism in terms of the new Cavite pragmatism , when Iris said : " Look ! " and pointed to the window where , bobbing against the glass , was a bright red child 's balloon on which had been crudely painted : " Jesus Saves . " Stokharin chuckled when he saw it . " Very ingenious . Someonegets on the floor beneath and tries to shake us with his miracle . Now we produce the counter-miracle . " He slid the window open . The cold air chilled us all . He took his glowing pipe and jabbed it into the balloon which exploded loudly ; then he shut the window beaming . " It will be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little fire and : pop ! they disappear like bad dreams . "  |p163The  next six months after the directors ' meeting were full of activity , and danger . Paul was forced to hire bodyguards to protect Cave from disciples as well as from enemies while the rest of us who were now known publicly as Cave 's associates were obliged to protect our privacy with unlisted telephone numbers and numerous other precautions none of which did much good for we were continually harassed by maniacs and interviewers . The effect Cave had made on the world was larger than even Paul , our one optimist , had anticipated . I believe even Cave himself was startled by the vastness and the variety of the response . As I recall , seldom did a day pass without some new expose or interpretation of this phenomenon . Bishop Winston attacked after nearly every telecast . The Catholic Church invoked its entire repertory of anathemas and soon it was whispered in devout Christian circles that the anti-Christ had come at last , sent to test the faith . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who heard Cave became hisp164partisans and Paul , to my regret but to the delight of everyone else , established a number of Cavite Centers in the major cities of the United States , each provided with a trained staff of analysts who had also undergone an intensive indoctrination in Cavesword . Stokharin headed these clinics with great energy . At Cave 's suggestion , one evening a week , the same evening , Cavites would gather to discuss Cavesword , to meditateon the beauty of death , led in their discussions and meditations by a disciple of Cave who was , in the opinion of the directors , equal to the task of representing Cave himself and his word before vast congregations . Iris was placed in charge of recruiting and training the proselytizers , while Paul handled the business end ; obtaining property in different cities and managing the large sums of money which poured in from all over the world . Except for Cave 's one encounter with the press that day in the Empire State Building ( an occasion which , despite its ominous beginning , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hostile ) , he was seen by no one except his intimates and the technicians of the television studio . Ways were found to disguise him so that he would not be noticed in the lobbies or elevators of the television network building . Later he spoke only from his Long Island retreat , his speeches being recorded on film in advance . By the time summer had arrived , there were over three million registered Cavites in the United States as well as numerous , unorganized believers abroad . Paul was everywhere at once , flying from city to city ( accompanied Iy two guards and a secretary ) ; he personally broke ground in Dallas for what was to be the largest Cavite Center in the United States and although the inaugural ceremonies were nearly stopped by a group of Baptist ladies carrying banners and shouting " Onward Christian Coldiers , " no one was hurt and the two oil millionaires who had financed the Center gave a great barbecue on the foundation site which was attended by many distinguished guests . Iris was entirely changed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few months , brisk , energetic , as deeply involved in details as a housewife with a new home . I saw very little of her that spring . Her days were mostly spent in a rented loft in the Chelsea district where she lectured the candidates for field work and organized a makeshift system of indoctrination for these potential Residents , as the heads of the various centers were known . She was extraordinarily well fitted for this work , to my surprise , and before the year ended she had what was in fact a kind of university where as many as three hundred men and women at a time were regularly transformed into Residentsand Deputy Residents and so on down through an ever proliferating hierarchy . For the most part , the first men and women we sent out to the country were highly educated , thoughtful people , entirely devoted to Cavesword . They were , I think , the best of all , for later , when it became lucrative to be a Resident , the work was largely taken over by energetic careerists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iris used me unmercifully those first months . I lectured her students ; I taught philosophy until , in exasperation at the absurdity of that , I told her to hire a professional teacher of philosophy which she did . Yet I enjoyed these men and women . Their sincerity , their excitement communicated itself to me and I became aware of something I had only known before from reading , from hearsay : the religious sense which I so clearly lacked , as did both Paul and Stokharin . I do n't think Cave really possessed it either because , although he believed entirely in himself and in the miraculous truth of his word , he did not possess that curious power to identify himself with creation , to transcend the self in contemplation of an abstraction , to sacrifice the personality to a mystical authority ; none of us , save Iris in love , possessed this power which , as nearly as I can get at it , is the religious sense in man . I learned about it only from those who came to learn from us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitied them for I knew that much of what theyp166evidently believed with such passion was wrong but , at the same time , I was invigorated by their enthusiasm , by the hunger with which they devoured Cavesword , by the dignity which their passion lent an enterprise that in Paul 's busy hands resembled more often than not , a cynical commercial venture . And I recognized in them ( oh , very early , perhaps in the first weeks of talking to them ) that , in their goodness and their love they would , with Caveswood , smudge as it turned each bright new page of life ; yet , suspecting this , I did not object nor did I withdraw . Instead , fascinated , I was borne by the tide to the shore ahead whose every rock I could imagine , sharp with disaster . Once a week the directors met on Long Island in the walled estate where Cave now lived with his guards ( his host had thoughtfully moved elsewhere until Cave chose for him to return ) . The meetings soon demonstrated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side and Iris , Clarissa and Cave on the other with myself as partisan , more often than not , to Cave . The division was amiable but significant . Paul and Stokharin wanted to place the Centers directly underthe supervision of the analysts while the rest of us , led by Iris ( Cave seldom intervened , but we had accepted already the fact that Iris spoke for him ) , preferred that the Centers be governed by the Residents . " It is certainly true that the therapists are an important part of each Center , " said Iris briskly , at the end of a long wrangle with Stokharin . " But these are Cavite Centers and not clinics for the advancement of post-Jungian analysis . It is Cavesword which draws people to the Centers , not mental illness . Those who have problems are of course helped by Stokharin 's people but , finally , it is Cave who has made it possible for them to face death . Somethingno one has done before . " And thus the point was won in our council though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to insinuate their own creatures into important Residencies . My own work went on fitfully . I composed an answer to  |p167Bisho|p  Winston which brought down on my head a series of ecclesiastical thunderbolts , each louder than the one before . I wrote a short life of Cave in simple declarative sentences which enjoyed a considerable success for many years and , finally , seriously , my first attempt at a real counterattack , I began the several dialogues in which Cave and I purportedly traversed the entire field of moral action . I felt that in these dialogues I could quietly combat those absolutist tendencies which I detected in the disciples . Cave himself made no pretense of being final on any subject other than death where , even without his particular persuasiveness , he stood on firm , even traditional ground . The attacks he received he no longer noticed . It was as simple as that . He 'd never enjoyed reading and to watch others make telecasts bored him , even when they spoke of him . After the fateful Empire State Building conference he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters which Paul forwarded to him and his relations with us , he was completely cut off from ordinary life , and perfectly happy . For though human contactshad been reduced to a minimum , he still possessed the polished glass eye of the world before whose level gaze he appeared once a week and experienced what he called : " Everyone : all of them , listening and watching everywhere . " In one year he had come a long way from the ex-embalmer who had studied a book of newspaper clippings on a Washingtonfarm and brooded about an old man in a hospital . Though Paul was never to refer again to the victim of Cave 's driving , I was quite sure that he expected , sooner or later , it would return to haunt us all . By midsummer , however , Cave had grown restless and bored and since the telecasts had been discontinued until the following November , he was eager to travel . He was never to lose his passion for places . It was finally decided that he spend the summer on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cavite who offered to place everything at Cave 's disposal . And , though warned that the heat might be uncomfortable , Cave and his retinue left secretly one night byp168chartered seaplane from Long Island Sound and for at least a month the press did not know what had happened to him . I declined to accompany Cave and Iris . Paul remained in New York while Iris 's work was temporarily turned over to various young enthusiasts , trained by her . I went back to the Hudson Valley , to my house and . . . I 've not been able to write for several days . According to the doctor , it is a touch of heat but I suspect that this is only his kind euphemism . I had broken off in my narrative to take a walk in the garden last Friday afternoon when I was joined by Butler whose attentions lately have been more numerous than I should like . " He 'll be here Sunday , Hudson . Why do n't we all three have dinner together that night and celebrate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I inched along the garden path , moving toward the hot shaded center where , beneath fruit trees , a fine statue of Osiris stood , looted in earlier days by the hotel management from one of the temples . I thought , however , with more longing of the bench beside the statue than of the figure itself whose every serene detail I 'd long since memorized . Butler adjusted his loose long stride to my own uneven pace . I walked as I always do now with my eyes upon the ground , nervously avoiding anythingwhich might make me stumble for I have fallen down a number of times in the last few years and I have a terror of broken bones , the particular scourge of old bodies . I was as glad as not that I did n't have to watch my companionwhile we chatted , for his red honest face , forever dripping sweat , annoyed me more than was reasonable . " And he 'll be pleased to know I 've got us a Center . Not much of one but good enough for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay directly in my path . It would take some doing to step over it , I thought , as I remarked , " I 'm sure the Pasha does n't know about this . "  | " Not really . " Butler laughed happily . " He thinks we 're just taking a house for ourselves to study the local culture . Later , after we get going , he can find out . " " I should be very careful , " I said and , very careful myself , I stepped over the rock : my legs detested the- extra exertion ; one nearly buckled as it touched the ground . I threw my weight on my cane and was saved a fall . Butler had not noticed . " Jessup is going to bring in the literature . We 'll say it 's our library . All printed in Arabic , too . The Dallas Center thinks of everything . " " Are they . . . equipped for such things ? " " Oh yes . That 's where the main university is now . Biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Marks were n't good enough , but Jessup did . He 'll tell you all about it . Quite a crew they turn out : best in the business but then they get the cream of the crop to begin with . " " Tell me , are the Residents still in charge of the Centers or do they share the administration with the therapists ? " " Therapists ? " Butler seemed bewildered . " In the old days there used to be the Resident and his staff and then a clinic attached where . . . " " You really are behind the times . " Butler looked at me as though I 'd betrayed a firsthand knowledge of earth 's creation . " All Residents and their staffs , including the Communicators like myself , get the same training ; part of it is in mental therapy . Others who show particular aptitude for it are assignedclinical work just as I do communication work in foreign countries . People who get to be Residents are usually teachers and administrators . Sometimes a Communicator gets a Residency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . " He then explained to me the official , somewhat Byzantinestructure of the Cavites . There were many new titles , indicating a swollen organization under the direction of a Counsel of Residents which , in turn , was responsible for the election from among their number of a unique Chief Resident whose reign lasted for the remainder of his lifetime.  |p170With  relief , I sat down on the bench beside Osiris . Butler joined inc . " Dallas of course is the main Residency , " he said . " It used to be in New York , years ago , " I said , thinking of the brownstone house , of the loft on Twenty-third Street . " Around twenty years ago it was moved to Dallas by the Chief Resident . Not only did they have the best-equipped Center there but the Texans make just about the best Cavites in the country . What they wo n't do for Cavesword is n't worth mentioning . They burned the old churches , you know ... every one in the state . " " And one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break eggs without making an omelet , " said Butler sententiously . " I see what you mean . Still , Cave was against persecution . He always felt it was enough for people to hear Cavesword .. . " " You got a lot of reading to do , " said Butler sharply . " Looks like you 've forgotten your text : And , if they persist in superstition , strike them , for one idolator is like a spoiled apple in the barrel , contaminating the others . ' " Butler 's voice , as he quoted , was round and booming , rich in vowel-sounds while his protruding eyes gazed without blinking into the invisible radiance of truth which hovered , apparently , above a diseased hibiscus bush . " I 've forgotten that particular quotation , " I said . " Seems funny you should since it 's just about the most famous of the texts . " But , though my ignorance continued to startle Butler , I could see that he was beginning to attribute it to senility rather than to laxity or potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first few years , " I said , curryingfavor . " But I 've been out of touch since and I suppose that , after Cave 's death , there was a whole mass of new doctrine with which I am unfamiliar , to my regret . " " Doctrine ! " Butler was shocked . " We have no doctrine . We are not one of those heathen churches with claims to divine ' guidance . We 're simply listeners to Cavesword . That 's all . He was the first to tell the plain truth and , naturally , we honorp171him but there is no doctrine even though he guides us the way a good father does his children . " " I am very old , " I said in my best dying-fall voice . " You must remember that when you are with me you are in the company of a man who was brought up in the old ways , who uses Christian terms from time to time . I was thirty when Cave began his mission . I am , as a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still alive . " This had its calculated effect . Butler looked at me with some awe . " Golly ! " he said . " It does n't really seem possible , does it ? Of course there 're still a few people around who were alive in those days but I do n't know of anybody who actually saw Cave . You did tell me you saw him ? " " Once only . " " Was he like the telecasts ? " " Oh yes . Even more effective , I think . " " He was big of course , six feet one inch tall . " " No , he was only about five feet eight inches , a little shorter than I . . . " " You must be mistaken because , according to all the texts , he was six feet one . " " I saw him at a distance of course . I was only guessing . " I was amused that they should have seen fit to change even Cave 's stature . " You can tell he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they still show them ? " " Still show them ! They 're the main part of our weekly Get-togethers . Each Residency has a complete library of Cave 's telecasts , one hundred eight including the last . Each week , a different one is shown by the Resident 's staff and the Resident himself , or someone assigned by him , discusses the message . " And they still hold up after fifty years ? " " Hold up ? We learn more from them each year . You should see all the books and lectures on Cavesword . . . several hundred important ones which we have to read as part of our communication duties , though they 're not for the lay/men . We discourage nonprofessionals from going into such problems , much too complicated for the untrained mind . " " I should think so . Tell me , is there any more trouble with the idolators ? " Butler shook his head . " Just about none . They were licked when the parochial schools were shut down . That took care of Catholicism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know all about them . " I nodded . Even in Egypt I had heard of massacres and persecutions . I could still recall the morning when I opened the Cairo paper and saw a large photograph of St Peter 's Cathedralsmoldering in its ruins , a fitting tomb for the last Pope and martyr who had perished there when a mob of Cavites had fired the Vatican . The Cairo paper took an obvious delight in these barbarities and I had not the heart to read of the wanton destruction of Michelangelo 's and Bernini 's works , the looting of the art galleries , the bonfire which was made in the Papal gardens of the entire Vatican library . Later , word came of a certain assistant-Resident of Topeka who , with a group of demolition experts and Cavite enthusiasts , ranged across France and Italy destroying the cathedrals with the approval of the local governments , and to the cheers of Cavite crowds who gathered in great numbers to watch , delightedly , the crumbling of these last monuments to superstition . Fortunately , the tourist bureaus were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The edict of Washington which outlawed idolatrous schools did the trick . The Atlantic government has always believed in toleration : even to this day it is possible for a man to be a Christian , though unlikely since the truth is so well known . " " But he has no churches left and no clergy . " " True , and if that discourages him he 's not likely to remain too long in error . As I 've told you , though , we have our ways of making people see the truth . " " The calculable percentage . " " Exactly . "  |p173I  looked at Osiris in the green shade . His diorite face smiled secretly back at me . " Did you have much trouble in the Latin countries ? " " Less than you might think . The ignorant were the big problem because , since they did n't know English , we were n't able to use the telecasts . Fortunately , we had some able Residents and after a little showmanship , a few miracles ( or what they took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their ex-priests told them about Cavesword . Nearly all of the older Residents in the Mediterranean countrieswere once Catholic priests . " " Renegades ? " " They saw the truth ; not without some indoctrination , I suspect . We 've had to adapt a good many of our procedural methods to fit local customs . The old Christmas has become Cavesday and what was Easter is now Irisday . " " Iris Mortimer ? " " Of course ; who else ? And then certain festivals which ... " " I suppose she 's dead now . " " Why , yes . She died six years ago . She was the last of the original five . " " Ah , yes , the five : Paul Himmel , Iris Mortimer , Ivan Stokharin , Clarissa Lessing and . . . " " And Edward Hastings . We still use his introduction even though it 's been largely obsoleted by later tests . his dialogues wilt of course be the basis for that final book of Cave which our best scholars have been at work on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I nearly laughed aloud . Poor feckless Hastings was now the author of ' my dialogues with Cave : I marveled at the ease with which the innumerable references to mys if had been deleted . I began to doubt of my own existence . I asked if Hastings were still alive and was told that he too was long dead . I then asked again about Iris . " Some very exciting things have come to light , " said Butler . " Certain historians at the Dallas Center feel that there is some proof that she was Cave 's sister . "  |p174I  was startled by this . " How could that be ? Was n't she from Detroit ? and was n't he from Seattle ? and did n't they meet for the first time in southern California at the beginning of his mission ? " " I see you know more Cavite history than you pretend , " said Butler amiably . " That of course has been the traditional point of view . Yet as her influence increased in the world ( in Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Cave 's ) our historians became suspicious . It was all perfectly simple , really : if she could exert nearly the same power as Cave himself then she must , in some way , be related to him . I suppose you know about the Miami business . No ? Well , their Resident , some years ago , openly promulgated the theory that Cave and Iris Mortimer were man and wife . A great many people believed him and though the Chief Resident at Dallas issued a statement denying the truth of all this , Miami continued in error and it took our indoctrination team several years to get the situation back to normal . But the whole businessdid get everyone to thinking and , with the concurrence of Dallas himself , investigations have been made . I do n't know many of the details but my colleague probably will . He keeps track of that kind of thing . " " If she is proven to be Cave 's sister will she have equal rank with him ? " " Certainly not . Cavesword is everything ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level though his inferior in truth : at least that appears to be the Dallas interpretation . " " She was very active , I suppose ? " " Right until the end . She traveled all over the world with Cavesword and , when she grew too old to travel , she took over the Residency of New York City which she held until she died . As a matter of fact , I have a picture of her which I always carry . It was taken in the last years . " He pulled out a steel-mesh wallet in which , protected by cellophane , was a photograph of Iris : the first I had seen in many many years . My hand shook as I held the picture up to the light . For a split second I felt her presence , saw in the saddenedp175face , framed by white hair , my summer love which had never been except in my own dreaming where I was whole and loved this creature whose luminous eyes had not altered with age , their expression the same as that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers froze ; the wallet fell to the ground ; I fainted into what I supposed with my last vestiges of consciousness to be death , to be nothing . I awakened in my own bed with my old friend Doctor Hussein beside me . He looked much concerned while , at the foot of the bed , stood Butler , very solemn and still . I resolved not to die with him in the room . " My apologies , Mr Butler , " I said , surprised that I could speak at all . " I 'm afraid I dropped your picture . " I had no difficulty in remembering what had happened . It was as if I had suddenly shut my eyes and opened them again , several hours having passed instead of as many seconds . Time , I decided , was all nonsense . " Think nothing of it ; I 'm only . . . " " You must not strain yourself , Mr Hudson , " said the doctor : a touch of sun , a few days in bed , plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left alone with a buzzer beside my bed which would summon the houseboy if I should have a coherent moment before taking a last turn for the worse . The next time , I think , will be the final one and though I detest the thought , these little rehearsals over the last few years , the brief strokes , the sudden flooding of parts of the brain with the blood of capillaries in preparation for that last arterial deluge , have got me used to the idea . My only complaint is that odd things are done to my memory by these strokes which , light as they have been , tend to alter parts of the brain , those parts which hold the secrets of the past . I have found this week , while convalescing from Tuesday 's collapse , that most of my childhood has been washed clean out of my memory . I knew of course that I was born on the banks of the Hudson but I can not for the life of me recall what schools I attended ;  |p176yet  my memories from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reread this memoir attentively to resume my train of thought , to refresh a dying memory . It is strange indeed to have lost some twenty years as though they 'd never been and , worse still , to be unable to find out about oneself in any case , since the will of others has effectively abolished one . I do not exist to the world and very soon ( how soon I wonder ? ) , I shall not exist even to myself , only this record a fragile proof that I once lived . Now I am able to work again . Butler pays me a daily visit , as does the doctor . Both are very kind but both tend to treat me as a thing which no longer matters . I have been written-off in their minds : I 'm no longer really human since soon , perhaps in a few days , I shall not be one of them but one of the dead whose dust motes the air they breathe . Well , let it come . The fraternity of the dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to sit up in bed ( actually I can get around as well or as badly as before but it tires me too much to walk so I remain abed ) . Sunday is here at last and from the excited bustle in the air which I feel rather than hear , Butler 's colleaguemust have arrived . I am not ready for him yet and I have hung a " Do Not Disturb " sign on the door , composed emphatically in four languages . It should keep them out for a few days . I have a premonition of disaster which , though it is no doubt perfectly natural at my age with the last catastrophe almost upon me , seems to be of a penultimate nature , a final human crisis . All that I have heard from Butler about this young man , this colleague of his , disposes me to fear him . For although my existence has been kept a secret from the newer generations , the others , the older ones , the chief counselorsare well aware of me and though I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am long since dead it is still possible that a shrewd young man with a career in the making might grow suspicious and one word to the older members of the hierarchy would be enoughp177to start an inquisition which could end in assassination ( ironic that I should fear that at this point ! ) or , more terrible , in a course of indoctrination where my apostasy would be reduced by drugs to conformity . It would be the most splendid triumph for Cave if , in my last days , I should recant : the best victory of all , the surrender of the original lutherist upon his deathbed . Yet I have a trick or two up my sleeve and the game 's not yet over . Should the new arrival prove to be the one I have so long awaited , I shall know how to act : I have planned for this day . My adversary will find me armed . But now old days draw me back ; the crisis approaches in my narrative . The first summer was my last on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Florida keys : short , brisk letters completely impersonal and devoted largely to what " he " was doing and saying . It seems that " he " was enchanted by the strangeness of the keys , yet was anxious to begin travelingagain . With some difficulty , 1 gathered between the lines , Iris had restrained him from starting out on a world tour : " He says he wants to see Saigon and Samarkand and so forth soon because he likes the names . I do n't see how he can get away yet , though maybe in the fall after his tour . They say now he can make his talks on film all at once which will mean of course he wo n't have to go through anything like last winter again . " There followed more news , an inquiry into my health ( in those days I was confident I should die early of a liver ailment : my liver of course now seems the one firm organ in my body ; in any case , I enjoyed my hypochondria ) and a reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of converts and detractors both . I pushed the letter away and looked out across the river . I was alone , awaiting Clarissa for tea . I had actually preparedtea since she never drank alcohol and I myself was a light drinker at best . . . a non-drinker that summer whenp178my liver rested ( so powerful is imagination ) like a brazen cannonball against the cage of bones . I sat on my porch which overlooked the lawn and the water ; unlike the other houses on that river , mine had the railroad behind it instead of in front of it , an agreeable state of affairs ; I do n't mind the sound of trains though the sight of them on their squalid tracks depresses me . Beside me , among the careful tray of tea things , the manuscriptof my dialogue lay neglected . I had not yet made up my mind whether to read it to Clarissa or not . Such things tended to bore her ; yet , if she could be enticed into attention , her opinion would be useful : such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I composed , with diligence rather than inspiration , an ethical system whose single virtue was that it tended to satisfy the needs of human beings as much as was possible without inviting chaos . I had , that morning over coffee , abolished marriage . During lunch , served me by my genteel but impoverished housekeeper ( although servants still existed in those days in a few great houses , people like myself were obliged to engage the casual services of the haughty poor ) , I decided to leave marriage the way it was but make divorce much simpler . After lunch , suffering from a digestive-inspired headache , I not only abolished marriageagain but resolutely handed the children over to the impersonal mercies of the state . Now , bemused , relaxed , my eyes upon the pale blue Catskillsand the summer green , the noise of motorboats like great waterbugs in my ears , I brooded upon the implications of what I was doing and , though I was secretly amused at my own confidence , I realized , too , that what I felt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , finally , not really the work of my own inspiration but a logical result of all that was in the world : a statement of the dreams of others which I could formulate only because I shared them . Cave regarded his own words as revelation when , actually , they only echoed the collective mind , a plausible articulation of what most men felt even though their conscious mindsp179were antipathetic , corseted and constricted by stereotyped ways of thinking , the opposite of what they truly believed . Yet at this step I , for one , hesitated . There was no doubt but that the children and the society would be the better for such an arrangement . . . and there was little doubt that our civilization was moving toward such a resolution . But there were parents who would want to retain their children and children who might be better cared for by their progenitorsthan by even the best-intentioned functionaries of the state . Would the state allow parents to keep their children if they wanted them ? If not , it was tyrannous ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could even the most enlightened board of analysts determine who should be allowed their children and who not ? The answer , of course , was in the retraining of future generations . Let them grow up accepting as inevitable and right the surrender of babies to the state . Other cultures had done it and ours could too . But I was able , vividly , to imagine the numerous cruelties which would be perpetrated in the name of the whole , while the opportunity for tyranny in a civilization where all children were at the disposal of a government brought sharply to mind the image of the anthill society which has haunted the imagination of the thoughtful for at least a century . I had got myself into a most gloomy state by the time Clarissa arrived , trailing across the lawn in an exotic anklelengthgown of gray which floated in yards behind her , like the diaphanous flags of some forgotten army . " Your lawn is full of moles ! " she shouted to me , pausing in her progress and scowling at a patch of turf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always more clover , remember that . " She turned her back on me to stare at the river which was as gray as her gown , but , in its soft tidal motion , spangled with light , like sequins on a vast train . She had no criticism of the river when she at last turned and climbed the steps to the porch ; she sat down with a gasp . " I 'm boiling ! Tea ? Hot tea to combat the heat . " I poured her a cup . " Not a hot day at all . " Actually it was  |p180very  warm . " If you did n't get yourself up as a Marie Corelli heroine , you 'd be much cooler . " " Not very gallant , are we today ? " Clarissa looked at me over her cup . " I 've had this gown for five hundred years . There used to be a wimple which went with it but I lost it somewhere . " " The material seems to be holding up quite well , " and now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the texture of the gown , like those bits of cloth preserved under glass in museums . " Silk lasts indefinitely , if one is tidy . I also do n't wear this much , as you can see , but with the devalued state of the dollar ( an ominous sign , my dear , the beginning of the end ! ) I 've been forced to redo a lot of old odds-and-ends I 've kept for sentimental reasons . This is one of them and I 'm very fond of it . " She spoke this last slowly , to forestall any further ungallantry . " I just wondered if it was cool . " " It is cool . Ah , a letter from Iris . " Like a magpie she had seen the letter beside my chair and , without asking permission , had seized it and read it through quickly . " I admire a girl who types , " she said , letting fall the letter . " I suppose they all do now though it seems like only yesterday that , next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of whom made advances . That was when we had to wear corsets and hatpins . One discouraged while the other quite protected . " Clarissa chuckled at some obscene memory . " I wonder if Paul can keep Cave from wandering off to some impossible place . " " I should n't be surprised . " She picked at the tea sandwiches suspiciously , curling back the top slices of bread to see what was underneath : tentatively , she bit into deviled ham ; she chewed ; she swallowed ; she was not disappointed ; she wolfed another sandwich , talking all the while . " Poor Cave is a captive now . His disciples are in full command . Even Mohammed , as strong-headed as he was , finally ended up a perfectp181pawn in the hands of Abu Bekr and the women , especially the women . " " I 'm not so sure about Cave . He . . . " " Does what they tell him , especially Iris . " " Iris ? But I should have said she was the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasantly . A moth flew into her artificialauburn hair ; unerringly , she found it with one capable hand and quickly snuffed out its life in a puff of gray dust from broken wings . She wiped her fingers on a paper napkin . The day was full of moths but , fortunately , none came near us again , preferring lawn and trees to us . " You are naive , Eugene , " she said , her little murder done . " It 's your nicest quality . In theory you are remarkably aware of human character ; yet , when you 're confronted with the most implausible appearance , you promptly take it for the reality . " I was irritated by this and also by the business of the sandwich , not to mention the murder of the moth ; I looked at Clarissa with momentary dislike . " I was not aware . . . " I began in a chilled voice but she interrupted me with an airy wave of her hand . " I forget no one likes to be called naive . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those designations , but to be thought trusting . . . . " She clapped her hands as though to punctuate her meaning ; then , after a full stop , she went on more soberly . " Iris is the one to look out for . Our own sweet , self-effacing , dedicated Iris . I adore her ; I always have , but she 's up to no good . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " You will . You would if you were n't entirely blind to what they used to call human nature . Iris is acquiring Cave . " " Acquiring ? " " Exactly the word . She loves him for all sorts of reasons but she can not have him in the usual sense ( I found out all about that , by the way ) . Therefore , the only thing left her to do is acquire him , to take his life in hers . You may thinkp182she may think that her slavish adoration is only humble love but actually it 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see the danger , even accepting your hypothesis . " " It 's no hypothesis and the danger is real . Iris will have him and , through him , she 'll have you all . " I , did not begin to understand that day and Clarissa , in her pythoness way , was no help , muttering vague threats and imprecations with her mouth full of bread . After my first jealousy at Iris 's preference of Cave to me , a jealousy which I knew , even at the time , was unjustified and a little ludicrous , I had come to accept her devotion to Cave as a perfectly natural state of affairs ; he was an extraordinaryman and though he did not fulfill her in the usual sense , he gave her more than mere lover might : he gave her a whole life and I envied her for having been able to seize so shrewdly upon this unique way out of ordinary life and into something more grand , more strange , more engaging . Though I could not follow her , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her days . That she was obscurely using Cave for her own ends , subverting him , did not seem to me possible and I was annoyed by Clarissa 's dark warnings . I directed the conversation into the other waters . " The children . I have n't decided what to do with them . " Clarissa came to a full halt . For a moment she forgot to chew . Then , with a look of pain , she swallowed . " Your chil-dren ? " " Any children , all children , " I pointed to the manuscript on the table . She began to understand . " I 'm quite sure you have abolishedmarriage . " " As a matter of fact , yes , this morning . " And now you do n't know what to do about the children . " " Precisely . I . . . " " Perfectly simple . " Clarissa was brisk : this , apparently , was a problem she had already solved . " The next step is controlled  |p183breeding  . Only those whose blood lines seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contraceptives are so popular no one will make babies by accident . . . in fact , it should be a serious crime if someone does . " " Quite neat , but I wonder whether , psychologically , it 's simple . There 's the whole business of instinct , of the natural desire of a woman to want her own child after bearing it . " " All habit . . . not innate . Children have been subordinate woman 's ace in the hole for generations . They have had to develop certain traits which , in other circumstances , they would not have entertained . Rats , whom we closely resemble , though they suckle their young will , in moments of mild hunger or even exasperation , think nothing of eating an entire litter . You can condition human beings to accept any state of affairs as being perfectly natural . " " I do n't doubt that . But how to break the habits of several thousand years . " " I suppose there are ways . Look what Cave is doing . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people want it to be nice : they do the real work or , rather , their terror does . In place of superstition , which they 've nearly outgrown , he offers them madness . " " Now really , Clarissa . . . " " I do n't disapprove . I 'm all for him , as you know . To make death preferable to life is of course utter folly though a perfectly logical reaction for these poor bewildered savages who , having lost their old superstitions , are absolutely terrifiedat the prospect of nothing . They want to perpetuate their little personalities forever into space and time and now they 've begun to realize the folly of that ( who , after all , are they ? are we ? in creation ? ) they will follow desperately the first man who pulls the sting of death and Cave is that man , as I knew he would be . " " And after Cave ? " " I will not say what I see . I 'm on the side of change , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarissa chuckled . A fish leaped grayly in the still river ; out in thep184channel a barge glided by , the muffled noise of its engines like slow heartbeats . " But you think it good for people to follow Cave ? you think what he says is right ? " " Nothing is good . Nothing is right . But though Cave is wrong , it is a new wrong and so it is better than the old ; in any case , he will keep the people amused and boredom , finally , is the one monster the race will never conquer .. . the monster which will devour us in time . But now we 're off the track . Mother love exists because we believe it exists . Believe it does not exist and it wo n't . That , I fear , is the general condition of the unchanging human heart . ' Make these young girls feel that having babies is a patriotic duty as well as healthful therapy and they 'll go through it blithely enough , without ever giving a second thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But to get them to that state of acceptance . . . " " Is the problem . I 'm sure it will be solved in a few genera-tions . " " You think I 'm right to propose it ? " " Of course . It will happen anyway . " " Yet I 'm disturbed at the thought of all that power in the hands of the state : they can make the children believe anything ; they can impose the most terrible tyranny ; they can blind at birth so that none might ever see anything again but what a few rulers , as ignorant as they , finally , will want them to see . There 'll be a time when all people are nearly alike . " " Which is precisely the ideal society . No mysteries , no romantics , no discussions , no persecutions because there 's no one to persecute . When all have received the same conditioning , it will be like ... " " Insects . " " Who have existed longer than ourselves and will outlast our race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " There is nothing else .

" She rose , a cloud of gray suspended above the porch . I walked her across the lawn to the driveway where her car was parked.  |p186The  breeze had , for the moment , died and the heat prickled me unpleasantly ; my temples itched as the sweat started . " Go on with it , " she said as she got into her car . " You may as well be on the side of the future as against it . Not that it much matters anyway . When your adorable President Jeffersonwas in Paris he said . . . " But the noise of the car starting drowned the body of her anecdote . I caught only the end : " That harmony was preferable . We were all amused ; I was the only one who realized that he was serious . " Dust swirled and Clarissa was gone down the drive at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong side of the road . I hoped this was an omen . I got through an unusually sultry July without much interferencefrom either Cave or the world . Paul paid me a quick visit to get the manuscript of the dialogues and I was reminded of those accounts of the progresses made by monarchs in other days , or rather of great ministers , for his party occupied four large cars which gleamed side by side in my driveway like glossy beasts while their contents , Paul and fourteen assistants , all strange to me save Stokharin , wandered disconsolatelyabout the lawn until their departure . Paul , though brisk , was cordial . " Trouble all over the map but b-i-g t-r-o-u-b-l-e , " he spelled it out with relish , size was important , I knew , to a publicist , even to one turned evangelist . " Is Cave disturbed by it ? " " Does n't pay any attention . Have n't seen him but Iris keeps me posted . By the way , we 're hiring a plane the first week in August to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along ? " I did n't but I said I would . I had no intention of being left out of anything : there was my work still to do . " I 'll let you know details . This is hot stuff ? " He waved the sheaf of papers I 'd given him.  | " Real hot , " I said but my irony was too pale , only primary colors caught Paul 's eye . " I hope so . Got any new stunts ? " I told him , briefly , about my thoughts on marriage or rather Cave 's thoughts . The literary device was for me to ask him certain questions and for him to answer them or , at least , to ask pointed questions in his turn . Cheerfully , I had committedCave to my own point of view and I was somewhat nervous about his reaction , not to mention the others . So far , only Clarissa knew and her approval was pleasant but perhaps frivolous : it carried little weight , I knew , with the rest . Paul whistled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure we 'll be able to handle that problem yet , if ever . " " I 've done it carefully , " I began . Stokharin , who had been listening with interest , came to my aid . " In the Centers we , how you say , Paul ? soft-pedal the family . We advise young boys to make love to the young girls without marrying or having babies . We speak of the family as a social unit , and society changes . I am most eager to study Mr Luther 's approach . Perhaps a little aid from those of us in clinical work . . . " But then the dark sedans began to purr ; nervous attendants whispered to Paul and I was soon left alone with the fragments of our brief conversation to examine and interpret at my leisure . I was surprised and pleased at Stokharin 's unexpected alliance . I had thought of him as my chief antagonist . But then , my work finished , I tended roses and read Cassius Dio until the summons in August carne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more blinding even than the vivid sky about the sun itself which made both elements seem to be a quivering blue fire in which was destroyedall of earth save a tiny smear of dusty faded green , the island of our destination . The pilot maneuvered the plane against a bone-gray dock  |p188where  , all alone , Iris stood , her hair tangled from the propellers ' wind and her eyes hidden by dark glasses . Like explorers in a new country , Paul , Stokharin and I scrambled onto the dock , the heat closing in about us like blue canvas , stifling , palpable . I gasped and dropped my suitcase . Iris laughed and ran forward to greet us ; she came first to me which , even in my dazzled , shocked state , I realized and valued . " Gene , you must get out of that suit this minute ! and get some dark glasses or you 'll go blind . Paul , how are you ? It 's good to see you , Doctor . " And , in the chatter of greetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow white beach to a grove of palm trees where the cottage stood . To our delight , the interior was cooled by machinery . I sank into a wicker chair even while Cave was pumping my hand . Iris laughed , " Leave him alone , John . He 's smothered by the heat . " " No hat , " said Cave solemnly after the first greeting which , in my relief , I 'd not heard . " You 'll get sunstroke . " Paul was now in charge . The heat which had enervated both Stokharin and me filled him with manic energy , like one of those reptiles which absorb vitality from the sun . " What a great little place , John ! Had no idea there were all the comforts of home down here , none at all . Do n't suppose you go out much ? " Cave , unlike Iris , was not tanned though he had , for him , a good color , a ruddiness of tone unlike his usual sallowness . " I do n't get too much sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , early in the morning . Most of the time I just hang around the house and look at the letters , and read some . I noticed on the table beside me an enormous pile - of travel magazines , tourist folders and atlases : this had obviously been Cave 's reading . I anticipated trouble . Paul prowled restlessly about the modern living room with its shuttered sealed windows . Stokharin and I , like fish back in their own element after a brief excursion on land , gaspedp189softly in our chairs while Iris told us of the keys , of their fishing trips . She was at her best here as she had been that other time in Spokane . . . being out of doors , in Cave 's exclusive company , brought her to life in a way the exciting busyness of New York did not . In New York she seemed like an object through which an electric current passed ; here on this island , in the sun 's glare , she had unfolded , petal after petal until the secret interior seemed almost exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , without warning , I experienced desire : that sharp rare longing which , in me , can reach no climax . Always before she had been a friend , a companion whose company I had jealously valued : her attentionalone had been enough to . satisfy me , but on this day I saw her as a man entire might and I plummeted into despair while talking of Plato . " The Symposium was the model , yes . There are other ways of casting dialogues such as introducing the celebrated dead brought together for a chat in Limbo . I thought , though , that I should keep the talk to only two . Cave and myself . . . Socrates and Alcibiades . " Alcibiades was precisely the wrong parallel but I left it uncorrected , noticing how delicately the hollow at the base of her throat quivered with life 's blood and although I attempted , as I often had before with bitter success , to think of her as so much mortal flesh , the body and its beauty only pulp and bone , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the eye of a geometric progression . . . that afternoon I was lost and I could not become , even for a moment , an abstract intelligence again : I saw the bone ; I saw the dust , yet I saw her existing , despite her nature and her fate , triumphant in the present . I cursed the flaw in my own flesh and hated life . " We liked it very much , " she said , not divining my mood , unaware of my sudden passion and its attendant despair . " You do n't think it 's too strong , do you ? All morality , not to mention the churches , will be aligned against us . " " John was worried at first . . . not that opposition frightenshim and it is his idea ; I mean you wrote the dialogue butp190it reflects exactly what he 's always thought . " Though in love 's agony , I looked at her sharply to make certain she was perfectlyserious : she was ; this helped soothe the pain . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have thought it was the other way around . " In a way we 're already on record , " Iris looked thoughtfullyacross the room at Cave who was showing Paul and Stokharin a large map of some strange country . " The Centers have helped a good many couples to adjust to one another without marriage and without guilt . " " But then there 's the problem of what to do with the children when the family breaks up . " Iris sighed . " Im afraid that 's already a problem . Our Centers are taking care of a good many children already . A number , of course , go out for adoption to bored couples who need something to amuse them . I suppose we 'll have to establishnurseries as a part of each Center until , finally , the government assumes the responsibility . " " If it becomes Cavite . " " When it becomes Cavite . " She was powerful in her casualness . " Meanwhile there are laws of adoption which vary from state to state and , if we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . " " Paul looks after us , " she smiled . " Did you know that he has nearly a hundred lawyers on our pay roll ? All protectingus . " From what ? " I had not kept track of this . " Lawsuits . . . mostly attempts by state legislatures to outlawthe Centers on the grounds of immorality and so on . The lawyers are kept busy all the time . " " Why have n't I read about any of this in the papers ? " " We 've been able to keep things fairly quiet . Paul is marvelouswith the editors . . . several have even joined us , by the way . . . secretly , of course . " " What 's the membership now ? " Iris gestured . " No one knows . We have thirty Centers inp191the United States and each day they receive hundreds of new Cavites . I suspect there are at least four million by now . " I gasped , beginning to recover at last from the heat , from my unexpected crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going so fast . " " Too fast . We have n't enough trained people to look after the Centers and on top of that we 've got to set up new Centers . Paul has broken the country up into districts , all very methodical : so many Centers per district each with a Resident in charge . Stokharin is taking care of the clinical work . " " Where 's the money coming from ? " " In bushels from heaven , " Iris smiled . " We leave all that up to Paul . I should n't be surprised if he counterfeits it . One thing I know , though , I must get back to New York soon , to the school . I should n't really have gone off in the middle of everything but I was tired and John wanted company so I came . " How is he ? " " As you see : calm . I do n't believe he ever thinks of any of our problems . He never talks about them ; never reads the reports Paul sends him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get several a clay , not to mention threatening mail . It 's got so bad that we now have full-time bodyguards . " " You think people are seriously threatening him ? " " I do n't know how serious they arc but we ca n't take chances . Fortunately , almost no one knows we 're here and , so far , no cranks have got through from the mainland . We get our groceries and mail brought in by boat every other day from Key Largo . Otherwise , we 're marooned here . " I looked about me for some sign of the guards but they were elsewhere : a Cuban woman glumly vacuuming in the next room was the only visible stranger . Cave abandoned his maps and atlases long enough to tell me how much the dialogues pleased him . " I wish I could put it down like you do . I can only say it when people listen . " You feel I 've been accurate ? "  |p192He  nodded solemnly . " Oh , yes . . . it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I realized that he 'd already assumed full responsibility ( and credit , should there be any ) for my composition ; I accepted his presumption with amusement . Only Stokharin seemed aware of the humor of the situation . I caught him staring at me with a shrewd expression ; he looked quickly away and his mouth was rigid as he tried not to smile . I liked him at that moment : we were the only two , evidently , who had not been possessed by Cave . I felt like a conspirator . For several days we talked , or rather Paul talked . He had brought with him charts and statements and statistics and , though Cave did not bother to disguise his boredom , he listened most of the time and his questions , when they did occur , were apposite . The rest of us were fascinated by the extent of what Paul referred to as the " first operational phase . " Various projects had already been undertaken ; others were put up to the directors for discussion . The mood was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of a meeting of account-executives in an advertising firm than the pious foregathering of a messiah 's apostles . . . and already that word had been used in the press by the curious as well as by the devout . Cave was the messiah to several million Americans , one not come with fire to judge the world , nor one armed with the instruction of a supernatural being whose presence was elsewhere but whose secret word had been given this favorite son . . . no , Cave was of another line : that of the prophets , of the instructors like Jesus before he became Christ , like Mohammed before he became Islam . Cave was the one in our age whose single task it was to speak out , to say the words all men waited for yet dared not speak nor even attend without the overpowering authority of another who had , plausibly , assumed the guise of master . I could not help but wonder as I watched Cave in those hectic conferences if the past had been like this . Cave certainly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took three centuries for Christianityto infest the world . It was to take Cave only three years to conquer Europe and the Americas . But I did not have this foreknowledge in Florida . I only knew that Paul was handling an extraordinary business in a remarkable way . There was no plan so vast that he could not contemplate its execution with ease . He was exhausting in his energy and , though he did not possess much imagination , he was a splendid improviser , using whatever themes were at hand to create his own dazzling contrapuntal effects with . We decided upon a weekly magazine to be distributed gratis to the Cavites ( I was appointed editor though the real work , of which I was entirely ignorant , was to be done by a crew already at work on the first issue ) ; we determined to send abroad certain films to be shown by Cavite lecturers ; we approved the itinerary of Cave 's national tour in the fall ( Cave was most alive during this discussion ; suggesting cities he wanted particularly to sec , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we planned several dinners to be held in New York with newspaper editors and political figures and we discussed the advisability of Cave 's accepting an invitation to be questioned by the Committee on National Morals and Americanism of the House of Representatives , a remarkably powerful Committee which had begun to show an interest in the progress of our Centers . It was decided that Cave delay meeting them until the time was propitious , or until he had received a subpoena . Paul , with his instinctive sense of the theatrical , did not want to have this crucial meeting take place without a most careful build-up . We discussed the various steps taken or about to be taken by certain state legislatures against the Centers . The states involved were those with either a predominantly Catholic or predominantly Baptist population . Since the Centers had been organized to conform with existing state and federal laws ( the lawyers were earning their fees ) , Paul thought they would have a difficult time in closing any of them . The several laws which had been passed were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher courts . Though the established churches were now fighting us with every possible weapon of law and propaganda , we were fully protected , Paul felt , by the Bill of Rights even in its currently abrogated state . Late in the afternoon after one of the day 's conferences had ended , Iris and I swam in the Gulf , the water as warm as blood and the sky soft with evening . We stayed in the water for an hour , not talking , not really swimming , merely a part of the sea and the sky , two lives on a curved horizon , quite alone ( for the others never ventured out ) , only the bored bodyguard on the dock reminded us that the usual world had not slipped away in a sunny dream , leaving us isolated and content in that sea from which our life had come so long ago ... water to water , I thought comfortably as we crawled up on the beach like new-lunged creatures . Iris undid her bathing cap and her hair , streaked blonde by the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her shoulders . She sighed voluptuously . " If it would always be like this . " " If what ? " " Everything . " " Ah , " I ran my hand along my legs and crystals of salt glittered and fell ; we were both dusted with light . " You have your work , " I added . . . with some malice though I was now under control . . . my crisis resolved after one sleepless night . I could now look at her without longing , without pain ; regret was another matter but regret was only a distant relativeto anguish . " I have that , too , " she said . " The work uses everything while this . . . is a narcotic . I float without a thought or a desire like . . . like an anemone . " " You do n't know what an anemone is , do you ? " She laughed like a child . " How do you know I do n't ? " " You said it like somebody reading a Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , too . " I do n't know . Perhaps something like a jellyfish . It has a lovely sound : sea anemone . "  |p195We  were interrupted by a motorboat pulling into the dock . " It 's the mail , " said Iris . " We 'd better go back to the house now . While we collected towels , the guard on the dock helped the boatman carry two large boxes of groceries and mail to the house . Between a pair of palm trees , a yard from the door of the house , the bomb went off in a flash of light and gray smoke . A stinging spray of sand blinded Iris and me . The blast knocked me off balance and I fell backward onto the beach . For several minutes , my eyes filled with tears and burning from the coral sand , I was quite blind . When I was finally able to see again , Iris was already at the house trying to force open the door . One of the palm trees looked as if it had been struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoldering . The windows of the house were broken and I recall wondering , foolishly , how the air-conditioning could possibly work if the house was not sealed . The door was splintered and most of its paint had been burned off : it was also jammed for Iris could not open it . Meanwhile , from a side door , the occupants of the house had begun to appear , pale and shaken . I limped toward the house , rubbing my eyes , aware that my left knee had been hurt . I was careful not to look at either the boatman or the guard . Their remains inextricably strewn among tin cans and letters in the bushes . Paul was the first to speak : a torrent of rage which jolted us all out of fear and shock . Iris , after one look at the dead men , fled into the house . I stood stupidly beside the door , rolling my eyes to dislodge the sand and listening to Paul . Then the other guards came with blankets and gathered up the pieces of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that Cave was standing slightly apart , nearest the house . He was very pale . He spoke only once , half to himself for Paul was still ranting : " Let it begin , " said Cave softly . " Now , now.  |p196It  began indeed , like the first recorded shot of a war . The day after the explosion , we left the island and Cave was flown to another retreat , this time in the center of New York City where , unique in all the world , there can exist true privacy , even invisibility . The Cavite history of the next two years is publicly known and the private aspects of it do not particularly reveal . It was a time of expansion and of battle . The opposition closed its ranks . Several attempts were made on all our lives and , six months after our return from Florida , we were all , except the indomitable Clarissa , forced to move into the brand-new Cavite Center , a quickly built but handsomebuilding of yellow glass on Park Avenue . Here on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion surrounded by Babylonian gardens and a wall of glass through which the encompassing city rose like stalagmites , Cave and Paul , Stokharin and Iris and I all lived with our bodyguards , never venturing out of the building which resembled , during that time , a military headquarters with guards and adjutantsp197and a maze of officials through whom both strangers and familiars were forced to pass before they could meet even myself , much less Cave . In spite of the unnaturalness of the life , it was , I think , the happiest time of my life . Except for brief excursions to the Hudson , I spent the entire two years in that one building , knowing at last the sort of security and serenity which monks must have known in their monasteries , in their retreats . I think the others were also content , except for Cave who eventuallygrew so morose and bored by his confinement that Paul not only had to promise him a world tour but , for his vicarious pleasure , played , night after night in the Center 's auditorium , travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain films to be halted at various interesting parts so that he might examine some landscape or building ( never a human being , no matter how quaint ) ; favorite movies were played over and over again , long after the rest of us had gone off to bed , leaving Cave and the projectionist alone with the bright shadows of distant places . . . alone save for the ubiquitous guards . There were a number of attacks upon the building itself but since all incoming mail and visitors were checked by machinery for hidden weapons there was never a repetition of that island disaster which had had such a chilling effect on all of us . Pickets of course marched daily for two years in front of the Center 's door and , on four separate occasions , mobs attempted to storm the building : they were repulsed easily by our guards ( the police , for the most Catholic , did not unduly exert themselves in our defense ; fortunately , the building had been constructed with the idea of defense in mind ) . The life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us had an office and Cave had a large suite where he spent his days watching television and pondering journeys . He did not follow with much interest the doings of the organization though he had begun to enjoy reading the attacks which regularly appeared against him and us in the newspapers . Bishop Winston was the leader of the non-Catholic oppositionp198and his apologias and anathemas inspired us with admiration . He was , I think , conscious of being the last great spokesman of the Protestant churches and he fulfilled his historic function with wit and dignity and we admired him tremendously . By this time , of course , our victory was in sight and we could show magnanimity to those who remained loyal to ancient systems . I was the one most concerned with answering the attacks since I was now an editor with an entire floor devoted to the Cavite Journal ( we were not able to think up a better name ) . At first it was published weekly and given away free but after the first year it became a daily newspaper , fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties as editor , I was also the official apologist and I was kept busy composing dialogues on various ethical matters , ranging from the virtues of cremation to fair business practices . Needless to say , I had a good deal of help and some of my most resounding effects were contrived by others , by anonymous specialists . Each installment , however , of Cavite doctrine ( or rationalization as I preferred to think of my work ) was received as eagerly by the expanding ranks of the faithful as it was denounced by the Catholic Church and the new league of Protestant Churches under Bishop Winston 's guidance . We received our first serious setback when , in the autumn of our first year in the new building , we were banned from the television networks through a series of technicalities created by Congress for our benefit and invoked without warning . It took Paul 's lawyers a year to get the case through the courts which finally reversed the government 's ruling . Meanwhile , we counterattacked by creating hundreds of new Centers where films of Cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Centers where huge crowds gathered to see and hear him and it was always Paul 's claim that the government 's spiteful action had , paradoxically , been responsiblefor the sudden victory of Cavesword : not being able to listen to their idol in their own homes the Cavites , and evenp199the merely curious , were forced to visit the Centers where , in the general mood of camaraderie and delight in the same word , they were organized quite ruthlessly . Stokharin 's clinics handled their personal problems . Other departments assumed the guidance and even the support , if necessary , of their children while free medical and educational facilities were made available to all who applied . At the end of the second year , there were more enrolled Cavites than any other single religious denomination including the Roman Catholic . I published this fact and the accompanying statistics with a certain guilt which , needless to say , my fellow directors did not share . The result of this revelation was a special Congressional hearing . In spite of the usual confusion attendant upon any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event was well-staged , preparing the way politically , to draw the obvious parallel , for a new Constantine . It took place in March and it was the only official journey any of us , excepting Paul , had made from our yellow citadel for two years . The entire proceedings were televised , a bit of unwisdom on the part of the hostile Congressmen who , in their understandable eagerness for publicity , overlooked their intended victim 's complete mastery of that medium . I did not go to Washington but I saw Cave and Paul and Iris off from the roof of the Center . Because of the crowds which had formed in the streets , hoping for a glimpse of Cave , the originalplan to fly to Washington aboard a chartered airplane was discarded at the last minute and two helicopters were ordered instead to pick up Cave and his party on the terrace in front of the penthouse , a mode of travel not then popular . Paul saw to it that the departure was filmed . A dozen of us who were not going stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few feet above the roof , their ladders dangling . Then Cave appeared with Paul and Iris while a camera crew recorded their farewell and departure . Cave looked as serene as ever , quite pale in his dark blue suit and white shirt ... a small austere figurep200with downcast eyes . Iris was bright-faced from the excitement and cold ; there was a sharp wind on the roof which tangled her hair . " I 'm terrified , " she whispered fiercely in my ear as we shook hands formally for the camera . " Paul seems in full command , " I said , comfortingly . And Paul , not Cave , was making a short speech to the camera while Cave stood alone and still ; then , in a gust of wind , they were gone and I went to my office to watch the hearings . The official reason for the investigation was based upon certain charges made by the various churches that the Cavites were subverting Christian morality by championing free love and publicly descrying the eternal institution of marriage . This was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to contemplate since it was the strongest of the numerous allegations and , in their eyes , the most dangerous to the state , the one most likely to get the largest amount of publicity . For some years the realm of public morals had been a favorite excursion grounds for the Congress and their tournaments at public expense were attendeddelightedly by everyone . This particular one , affecting as it did the head of the largest single religious establishment in the country would , the Congressmen were quite sure , prove an irresistible spectacle . It was . At first there was a good deal of confusion . Newspaper men stumbled over one another ; flash bulbs were dropped ; Congressmen could not get through the crowd to take their seats . To fill in , while these preliminaries were got over , the camera was trained upon the crowd which was beginning to gather in front of the Capitol ; a crowd which grew , as one watched , to Inaugural size . Though it was orderly , a troop of soldiers in trucks soon arrived , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a cordon of fixed bayonets before the various entrances to the Capitol . Here and there , against the gusty blue sky , banners with the single word " Cave , " gold on blue , snapped : In hoc sign indeed !  |p201Then  the commentators who had been exclaiming at some length on the size of the crowd , excitedly announced the arrival of Cave . A roar of sound filled the plaza . The banners were waved back and forth against the sky and I saw everywherethe theatrical hand of Paul Himmell . The scene shifted to the House of Representatives entrance to the Capitol . Cave wearing an overcoat but bareheaded , stepped out of the limousine . he was alone . Neither Paul nor Iris was in sight . It was most effective that he should come like this , without equerries or counselors . He stood for a moment in the pillared entrance , aware of the crowd outside ; even through the commentator 's narrative one could hear , like the surf falling : Cave ! Cave ! Cave ! For a moment it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol , but out onto the steps to the crowd ; but then the chief of the Capitol guard , sensing perhaps that this might happen , gently steered him up the stairs . The next shot was of the Committee Room where the hearings had at last begun . A somewhat phlegmatic Jesuit was testifying . His words were difficult to hear because of the noise in the committee room , and the impotent shouts of the chairman . The commentator gave a brief analysis of the Jesuit 's attack on Cave and then , in the midst of a particularly loud exchange between the chairman and the crowd , the clerk of the court proclaimed : John Cave . There was silence . The crowd parted to make way for him . Even the members of the committee craned to get a good look at him as he moved quietly , almost demurely , to the witness chair . The only movement in the room was that of the Papal Nuncio who , in his robes , sat in the front rank of the audience . He crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was respectful , almost inaudible . Several times he was asked to repeat his answers even though the room was remarkably still . At first Cave would answer only in monosyllables , not looking up , not meeting the gaze of his interrogatorswho took heart at this , professionals themselves : theirp202voices which had almost matched his for inaudibility , began to boom with confidence . I waited for the lightning . The first intimation came when Cave looked up . For nearly five minutes he had not raised his eyes once during the questioning . Suddenly he looked up and I saw that he was trying to locate the camera ; he did , and it was like a revelation : a sudden shock went through me and as well as I knew him , as few illusions as I had about him , I was arrested by his gaze . . . it was as though only he and I existed , as though he were I ; all of those who watched responded in the same fashion to that unique gaze . The Committee , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim had with one glance appropriated the eye of the world . The subsequent catechism is too well known to record here ; we used it as the main expositionof Cavesword , the one testament which contained the entire thing . It was almost as if the Congressmen had been given the necessary questions to ask , like those supporting actors whose minor roles are designed to illuminate the genius of the star . Two of the seven members of the Committeewere Cavites . This was soon apparent . The other five were violently in opposition . One as a Catholic , another as a Protestant , and two as materialistic lovers of the old order . Only one of the attackers , a quiet scholarly-looking Jew , made any real point . He argued the perniciousness of an organizationwhich , if allowed to prosper , would replace the state and force all dissenters to conform ; it was his contention that the state prospered most when no one system was sufficiently strong to dominate . I wanted to hear more of him but his Catholic colleague , a bull-voiced Irishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cavites . Cave , to my astonishment , had memorized most of the dialogues I 'd written and he said my words with the same power that he said his own . I was startled by this . There had been no hint that such a thing might happen and I could n't , for some time , determine the motive until I recalled **26;8072;TOOLONG to being quoted in print ; he had apparently realized that now there would be a complete record of his testimony and so , for the sake of both literacy and consistency , he had committed to memory those words of mine which were thought to be his . At the great moment , however , the peroration ( by which time there were no more questions and Cave 's voice alone was heard ) he became himself , and spoke Cavesword . Then , without the Committee 's leave , in the dazzled silence which followed upon his last words , he got up abruptly and left the room . I switched off the television set . That week established Cavesword in the country and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the United States was Cavite . The desertion of the old establishments for the new resembled , at uneasy moments , revolution . The Congressional Committee , though anti-Cavite , did not dare even to censure him . . . partly from the fear of the vast crowd which waited in the Capitol plaza and partly from the larger , more cogent awareness that it was politically suicidal for any popularly elected Representative to outrage a minority of such strength . The hearing fizzled out after Cave 's appearance and though there were a few denunciatory speeches on the floor of Congress , no official action was taken ; shortly afterwards the ban on Cave 's television appearances was lifted but by then it was too late and millions of people had got permanently into the habit of attending weekly meetings at the various Centers to listen to Cave , to discuss with the Residents and their staffs the points of doctrine . . . and doctrine it had become . The second year in our yellow citadel was more active than the first . It was decided that Cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery would be kept intact and the legend would grow under the mostp204auspicious circumstances . He did not reveal his actual motive in Cave 's presence but I was aware , from private conversations we had , just the two of us , of the wisdom of his plan . He explained himself to me late one afternoon in my office . " Get him in front of a really hostile crowd and there 'd be no telling what might happen . " Paul was restlessly marching about the room in his shirtsleeves . . . a blunt cigar in his mouth gave him the appearance of a lower-echelon politician . " There 's never been a hostile audience yet , " I reminded him . " Except for the Congressional hearings and I thought he handled himself quite well with them . " " With your script in his head , " Paul chuckled and stopped his march to the filing cabinet by way of that huge televisionscreen which dominated every office and home . " What I mean is , he 's never been in a debate . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Congressmen were pretty mild and even though they were n't friendly they stuck to easy issues . But what would happen if Bishop Winston got him up before an audience ? Winston 's a lot smarter and he 's nearly as good in public . " " I suppose Cave would hypnotize him , too . " " Not on your life . " Paul threw himself into a chair of flimsy chrome and plastic . " Winston 's been trying to arrange a debate for over two years . He issues challenges every Sunday on his program ( got a big audience , too . . . though not close to ours ; I keep checking it ) . " " Does Cave want to give it a try ? " " He 's oblivious to such things . I suppose he would if he thought about it . Anyway it 's to our advantage to keep him out of sight . Let them see only a television image , hear only his recorded voice . It 's wonderful copy ! Big time . " He was out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set : the screen was suddenly filled with a romantic scene , a pulsatinggreen grotto with water falling in a thin white line ... so perfected had the machine become that it was actually like looking through a window , the illusion of depth quite perfect and the colors true . A warm deep voice off-screenp205suggested the virtues of a well-known carbonated drink . Paul turned the switch off . I was relieved since I , alone in America , was unable to think or work or even relax while the screen was bright with some other place . " He wo n't like it . He expects next year , at the latest , to start his world tour . " " Perhaps then , " said Paul thinly . " Anyway , the longer we put it off the better . Did you know we turn away a thousand people a day who come here just to get a glimpse of him ? " " They see him at the Center meetings . " " Only our own people . . . the ones in training to be Residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then some outsider gets in but it 's rare . " I glanced at the tear-sheet of my next day 's editorial ; it contained , among other useful statistics , the quite incredible figures of Cavite membership in the world . Dubiously , I read off the figure which Paul had given me at a directors ' meeting . " It 's about right , " he said complacently , coming to a full stop at the files . " We do n't actually know the figures of places without proper Centers like the Latin countries where we are undergoing a bit of persecution . But the statistics for this country are exact . " " It 's hard to believe . " I looked at the figure which representedso many human beings , so much diversity , all touched by one man . " Less than three years ... " " Three more years and we 'll have most of Europe too . " " Why , I wonder ? " " Why ? " He slammed shut the cabinet drawer which he 'd been examining . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask why ? Cavesword . . . and all your words too , did the trick . That 's what . We 've said what they wanted to hear . . . just the opposite of my old game of publicity where we said what we wanted them to hear . This time it 's just the other way around and it 's big , ah , it 's big . " I could agree with that but I pressed him further . " I know what 's happened , of course , and your theory is certainly  |p206correct  if only because had we said the opposite of what they wanted to hear nothing would have happened . But the questionin my mind , the real why , ' is Cave and us . Why we of all the people in the world ? Cavesword , between us and any school of philosophy , is not new . Others have said it more eloquently . In the past it was a reasonably popular heresy which the early popes stamped out . . . " " Timing ! The right man at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece you did on Mohammed ... " " I stole most of it . " " So what ? Most effective . You figured how only at that one moment in Arabian political history could such a man have appeared . " I smiled . " That is always the folly of the one unique moment . ' For all I know such a man could have appeared in any of a hundred other Arab generations . " " But he never did except that one time . . . which proves the point . " I let it go . Paul was at best not the ideal partner in the perennial conversation . " There is no doubt but that Cave 's the man , " I said , neutrally . " Not the last of the line but at least the most effective , considering the shortness of the mission so far . " We have the means . The old people did n't . Every man , woman , and child in this country can see Cave for themselves , and at the same moment . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . it took a generation for news of him to travel from one country to the next . " " Parallels break down , " I agreed . " It 's the reason I wonder so continually about Cave and ourselves and what we are doing in the world . " " We 're doing good . The people are losing their fear of death . Last month there were twelve hundred suicides in this country directly attributable to Cavesword . And these people did n't kill themselves just because they were unhappy , they killed themselves because he had made it easy , even de/sirable . Now you know there 's never been anybody like that before in history , anywhere . " " I 'll say not . " I was startled by the figure he had quoted . In our Journal we were always reporting various prominent suicides and , though I had given orders to minimize these voluntary deaths , I had been forced every now and then to record the details of one or another of them . But I 'd had no idea there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite sure of the number . " Oh yes . " He was blithe . " At least that many we know of . " " I wonder if it 's wise . " " Wise ? What 's that got to do with it ? It 's logical . It 's the proof of Caveswood . Death is fine so why not die ? " " Why not live ? " " It 's the same thing . " " I would say not . " " Well , you ought to play it up a little more anyway . I meant to talk about it at the last directors ' meeting but there was n't time . " " Does Cave know about this ? About the extent ... " " Sure does . " Paul headed for the door . " He thinks it 's fine . Proves what he says and it gives other people nerve . This thing is working . " There was no doubt about that of course . It is hard , precisely , to give the sense of those two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toppling waves which swept into history the remaining edifices of other faiths and institutions . I had no real firsthand impressions of the country for I seldom stirred from our headquarters . I 'd sold the house on the river . I had cut off all contacts with old friends and my life , simply , was Cave . I edited the Journal , or rather presided over the editors . I discussed points of doctrine with the various Residents who came to see me in the yellow tower . They were devoted men and their enthusiasmwas heartening , if not always communicable to me . Eachp208week was published further commentaries on Cavesword and I found my time grew short if I tried to read them all . I contented myself , finally , with synopses prepared for me by the Journal 's staff and I felt like a television emperor keeping abreast of contemporary letters , but there was not enough time , as it was , in which to contemplate the great things . Once a week we all dined with Cave . Except for that informal occasion we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captivity ( and it was exactly that ; we were all captives to some degree ) , he was cheerful enough . Paul saw to it that he was kept busy all day addressing Residentsand Communicators , answering their questions , firing them by the mere fact of his presence . It was quite common for strangers to faint upon seeing him for the first time , as a man and not as a figure on a bit of film . He was good-natured , though occasionally embarrassed by the chosen groups which were admitted to him . He seldom talked privately to any of them , however , and he showed not the faintest interest in their problems , not even bothering to learn their names . He was only interested in where they were from and Paul , aware of this , as an added inducement to keep Cave amenable , took to including each group at least one Cavite from some far place like Malaya or Ceylon . Iris was busiest of all . She had become , without design or preparation , the head of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cavesword were trained , thousands of them each year , in a course which includednot only Cavesword but history and psychology as well . There were also special classes in television-producing and acting . Television , finally , was the key . It was the primary instrument of communication . Later , with a subservient government and the aid of mental therapists and new drugs , television became less necessary but , in the beginning , it was everything . Clarissa 's role was , as always , enigmatic . She appeared when she pleased and she disappeared when she pleased . I discovered that her position among the directors was due top209her possession of the largest single block of stock , dating back to the first days . During the crucial two or three years , however , she was often with us merely for protection since all our lives had been proscribed by the last remnants of the old churches who , as their dominion shrank , fought more and more recklessly to destroy us . Stokharin spent his days much like Iris , instructing the Communicators and Center-therapists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was far more likeable : Paul was " freed , " Stokharin would say with some satisfaction , due to therapy . . . and a new father-image . Less than two years after the Congressional hearings , Paul , in his devious way , entered politics and in the following Congressional elections , without much overt campaigning on our part , the majority of those elected to both Houses of the Congress were either Cavite or sympathetic . At last I have met him . Early this evening I went downstairs to see the manager about an ietm on my bill which was incorrect . I had thought that I should be safe for this was the time when most of the hotel guests are bathing and preparing for dinner . Unfortunately , I encountered Butler and his newly arrived colleague in the center of the lobby . I suddenly found myself attempting , by an effort of will , very simply to vanish into smoke like one of those magicians in a child 's book . But I remained all too visible . I stopped halfway across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Butler murmuring greetings and introductions to Communicator Jessup ( soon to be Resident of Luxor " when we get underway " ) : " And this , Jack , is the Mr Hudson I told you about . " The Resident-to-be shook my hand firmly . He was not more than thirty , a lean , dark-eyed mulatto whose features and coloring appealed to me , used as I now am to the Arabs ; beside him , Butler looked more red and gross than ever . " Butler has told me how useful you 've been to us , " saidp210Jessup . His voice was a little high but he did not have the trick of over-articulation which used to be so common among educated Negroes in earlier times , a peculiarity they shared with Baptist clergymen and professional poets . " I 've done what I could , little as it is , " I said ceremoniously . Then , without protest , I allowed them to lead me out onto the terrace which overlooked the setting sun and the muddy river . " We planned to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler expansively when we were seated , a tray of gin and ice and tonic water set before us by a waiter who was used now to American ways . " But you had the sign on your door so I told Jack we 'd better wait , till Mr Hudson is feeling better . You are okay now , are n't you ? " " Somewhat better , " I said , enjoying the British gin : I 'd had none since I left Cairo . " At my age one is either dead or all right . I seem not to be dead . " " How I envy you ! " said Jessup solemnly . His voice though high was strong . " Envy me ? " For a moment I did not quite understand . " To be so near the blessed state ! Not to see the sun again and feel the body quivering with corrupt life . . . oh , what I should give to be as old as you ! " " You could always commit suicide , " I said irritably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped him for only the space of a single surprised breath . " Cavesway is not possible for his servants , " he said at last , patiently . " You have not perhaps followed his logic as carefully as you might had you been living in the civilized world . " He looked at me with his bright dark eyes inscrutably focused . Why are you here ? I wanted to ask furiously , finally , but I only nodded my head meekly and said , " So much has changed since I came out here . I do recall , though , that Cavesway was considered desirable for all . " " It is . . . but not for his servants who must , through living , sacrifice their comfort . . . it is our humiliation , our martyrdom in his behalf . Even the humblest man or womanp211can avail mselves of Cavesway unlike us , his servants , who must live , disgusting as the prospect is , made bearable only by the knowledge that we are doing his work , communicating his word . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I intoned with reverent awe . " It is the least we can do for him . " The bright sun resembled that red-gold disk which sits on the brow of Horns . A hot wind of Numidia stirred the dry foliage about us . I could smell the metallic odor of the Nile 's water . A muezzin called , high and toneless in the evening . " Before I slip off into the better state , " I said at last , emboldenedby gin , " I should like to know as much as possible about the new world the Cavitcs have made . I left the United States shortly after Cave took his way . I have never been back . " " How soon after ? " The question came too fast . I gripped the arms of my chair tightly . " Two years after , I think , " I said . " I came to Cairo for the digging out in El Abul . " " How could you have missed those exciting years ? " Jessup 's voice became zealous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born then . . . and I 've always cursed my bad luck . I used to go about talking to complete strangers who had been alive in those great years . Of course most were laymen and knew little about the things I had studied but they could tell me how the sky looked the day he took his way . And , every now and then , it was possible to meet someone who had seen him . " " Not many laymen ever saw him , " I said . " I remember with what secrecy all his movements were enveloped . I was in New York much of the time when he was there . " " In New York ! " Jessup sighed voluptuously . " You saw him too , did n't you , Mr Hudson ? " Butler was obviously eager that I make a good impression . " Oh yes , I saw him the day he was in Washington . One of his few public appearances ! I was very devout in those days . I am now too , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daysp212when it was all new one was , well , exalted by Cavesword . I made a special trip to Washington just to get a glimpse of him . " I played as resolutely as possible upon their passionate faith . " Did you really see him ? " I shook my head sadly . " Only a quick blur as he drove away . The crowd was too big and the police were all around him . " " I have of course relived that moment in the library , watching the films , but actually to have been there that day . . . " Jessup 's voice trailed off as he contemplated the extent of my good fortune . " Then afterwards , after his death , I left for Egypt and I 've never been back . " " You missed great days . " " I 'm sure of that . Yet I feel the best days were before , when I was in New York and each week there would be a new revelation of his wisdom . " " You are quite right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the finer time even though those of us who feel drawn to the mother must declare that later days possessed some virtue too , on her account . " " Mother ? " I knew of course before he answered what had happened . " As Cave was the father of our knowledge , so Iris is its mother , " said Jessup . He looked at Butler with a half-smile . " Of course there are some , the majority in fact , of the Communicatorswho deprecate our allegiance to the mother , not realizing that it enhances rather than detracts from Cave . After all , the Word and the Way are entirely his . " Butler chuckled . " There 's been a little family dispute , " he said . " We keep it out of the press because it really is n't the concern of anybody but us , Cave 's servants . Do n't mind talking to you about it since you 'll be dead soon anyway and up here we 're all in the same boat , all Cavites . Anyway , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got attached to Iris . . . not that we do n't all love her equally.  |p213It  's just that they 've got in the habit of talking about death being the womb again , all that kind of stuff without any real basis in Cave . " " It runs all through his work , Bill . It 's implicit in all that he said . " Jessup was amiable but I sensed a hardness in his tone . It had come to this , I thought . " Well , we wo n't argue about it , " said Butler , turning to me with a smile . " You should see what these Irisians can do with a Cavite text . By the time they finish you do n't know whether you 're coming or going . " " Were you at all active in the Mission ? " asked Jessup , abruptly changing the subject . I shook my head . " I was one of the early admirers of Cave but I 'm afraid I had very little contact with any of his people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . . . when they were in the yellow tower , but it was impossible . Only the Residents and people like that ever got to see him personally . " " He was busy those days , " said Jessup , nodding . " He must have dictated nearly two million words in the last three years of his life . " " You think he wrote all those books and dialogues himself ? " " Of course he did . " Jessup sounded surprised . " Have n't you read Iris 's accounts of the way he worked ? The way he would dictate for hours at a time , oblivious of everything but Cavesword . " " I suppose I missed all that , " I mumbled . " In those days it was always assumed that he had a staff who did the work for him . " " The lutherists , " said Jessup , nodding . " They were extremelysubtle in their methods but of course they could n't distort the truth for very long ... " " Oh , " said Butler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what the word lutherist came from and I said I did n't know . I must have forgotten for I have a feeling it was taught us , back in the old days when we primitives were turned out , before you bright young fellows came along to show us how to do Caveswork. "  |p214Jessu|p  smiled . " We 're not that bumptious , " he said . " As for lutherist , it 's a word based on the name of one of the first followers of Cave . I do n't know his other name or even much about him . All that I know I 've been told . . . as far as I remember , the episode was never even recorded . Much too disagreeable . . . and of course we do n't like to dwell on our failures . " " I wonder what it was that he did , " I asked , my voice trembling despite all efforts to control it . " He was a nonconformist of some kind . He quarreled with Iris , they say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did they send him through indoctrination ? " " No , as far as I know . " Jessup paused . When he spoke again his voice was thoughtful . " According to the story I heard . .. legend really . . . he disappeared . They never found him and though we 've wisely removed all record of him , his name is still used to describe our failures : those among us , that is , who refuse Cavesword without indoctrination . Somewhere , they say , he is living , in hiding , waiting to undo Caveswork . As Cave was the anti-Christ so he , or rather anotherlike him , will attempt to destroy us . " " Not much chance of that . " Butler 's voice was confident . " Anyway , if he was a contemporary of Cave he must be dead by now . " " Not necessarily . After all Mr Hudson was a contemporary and he is still alive . " Jessup looked at me then ; his eyes , in a burst of obsidian light , caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's not much time left and I must proceed as swiftly as possible to the death of Cave and my own exile . The year of Cave 's death was not only a year of triumph but one of terror as well . The counteroffensive reached its peak in those busy months , and we were all in danger of our lives.  |p215In  the South , groups of Baptists stormed the new Centers , demolishing them and killing , in several instances , the Residents . Despite our protests and threats of reprisal , many state governments refused to protect the Cavite Centers and Paul was forced to enlist a small army to defend our establishments in those areas which were still dominated by the old religions . Several attempts were made to destroy our New York headquarters ; fortunately , they were all apprehended before any damage could be done though one fanatic , a Catholic , got as far as Paul 's office where he threw a grenade into a wastebasket , killing himself and slightly scratching Paul who had , in his usual fashion , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the proper moment . The election of a Cavite-dominated Congress eased things for us considerably , though it made our enemies all the more desperate . Paul fought back . Bishop Winston , the most eloquent of the Christian prelates and the most dangerous to us , had died , giving rise to the rumor , soon afterwards confirmed by Cavite authority to be a fact , that he had killed himself and that , therefore , he had finally renounced Christ and taken to himselfCavesword . Many of the clergy of the Protestant sects , aware that their parishioners and authority were falling away , became , quietly , without gloating on our part , Cavite Residents and Communicators . The bloodiest persecutions , however , did not occur in North America . The Latin countries , the seat of the old Catholic power which was itself the shadow of the Roman Empire , provided the world with a series of massacres remarkableeven in that murderous century . Yet it was a fact that in the year of Cave 's death , Italy was half-Cavite while France , England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of Latin America held out , imprisoning , executing , deporting Cavites against the inevitable day when our Communicators , undismayed , proud in their martyrdom ,  |p216would  succeed in their assaults upon these last citadels of paganism . On a hot day in August , our third and last autumn in the yellow tower , we dined on the terrace of Cave 's penthouse overlooking the city . The bright sky shuddered with heat . Clarissa , who had just come from abroad where she had been enjoying several seasons under the guise of an official tour of reconnaissance , was entirely the guest of honor . She sat wearing a large picture hat beneath the striped awning which sheltered our glass-topped table from the sun 's rays . Cave insisted on eating out-of-doors as often as possible even though the rest of us preferred the cool interior where we were not disturbed by either heat or by the clouds of soot which floated above the imperial city , impartially lighting upon all who ventured out into the open . It was our first " family dinner " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and the metaphors which he derived from this one conceit used even to irritate the imperturbableCave ) . At one end of the table sat Clarissa , with Paul and me on either side of her ; at the other end sat Cave , with Iris and Stokharin on either side of him ; Iris was on his left and on my right and , early in the dinner , when the conversation was particular , we talked . " I suppose we 'll be leaving soon , " she said . A sea gull missed the awning by inches . " I have n't heard anything about it . Who 's leaving . . . and why ? " " John thinks we 've all been here too long ; he thinks we 're too remote . " " He 's quite right about that . " I blew soot off my plate . " But where are we to go ? After all , there 's a good chance that if any of us shows his head to the grateful populace someone is apt to blow it off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But John is right . We must get out and see the people . . . talk to them direct . " Her voice was urgent . I looked at her thoughtfully , seeing the change that three years of extraordinary activity had wrought :  |p217she  was overweight and her face , as sometimes happens in the first access of weight , was smooth , without lines , youngerlookingbut also without much character or expression ... I kept thinking irrelevantly of a marshmallow for , in the light of day , her casually made-up face did resemble a pale smoothly powdered confection . Her wonderful sharpness , her old finenesswas entirely gone and the new Iris , the busy , efficient Iris had become like . . . like . . . I groped for the comparison , the memory of someone similar I had known in the past , but the ghost did not materialize ; and so haunted , faintly distrait , I talked to the new Iris I did not really know , to the visible half of a like-pair whose twin was lost somewhere in my memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , helping myself to the salad which was being served us by one of the Eurasian servants Paul , in an exotic mood , had engaged to look after the penthouse and the person of Cave . " I do n't think I 've been away from here half a dozen times in two years . " " It 's been awfully hard , " Iris agreed . Her eyes shifted regularly to Cave , like an anxious parent . " Of course I 've had more chance than anyone to get out but I have n't seen nearly as much as I ought . It 's my job , really , to look at all the Centers , to supervise in person all the schools but of course I ca n't if Paul insists on turning every trip I take into a kind of pageant . " " It 's for your own protection . " " I think we 're much safer than Paul thinks . The country 's almost entirely Cavite . " " All the more reason to be careful . The die-hards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them . " " Well , we must take our chances . John says he wo n't stay here another autumn . September is his best month , you know . I think he 's a little superstitious about it : it was September when he first spoke Cavesword . " " What does Paul say ? " I looked down the table at our ringmasterwho was telling Clarissa what she had seen in Europe . Iris frowned . " He 's doing everything he can to keep usp218here . . . I ca n't think why . John 's greatest work has been done face to face with people yet Paul acts as if he did n't dare let him out in public . We have quarreled about this for over a year , Paul and I. " " He 's quite right , I know . I 'd be nervous to go about in public without some sort of protection . You should see the murderous letters I get at the Journal . " " We 've nothing to fear , " said Iris flatly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We could easily grow out of touch , marooned in this tower . " " Oh , it 's not that bad . " To my surprise , I found myself defendingour monastic life . " Everyone comes here . Cave speaks to groups of the faithful every day . I sit like some disheveled hen over a large newspaper and I could n't be more instructed , more engaged in life , while you dash around the country almost as much as Paul does . " " But only seeing the Centers , only meeting the Cavites . I have no other life any more . " I looked at her curiously . There was no bitterness in her voice yet there was a certain wistfulnesswhich I 'd never noticed before . " Do you regret all this , Iris ? " I asked . It had been some time , three years , since I had spoken to her of ourselves , of personal matters : we had become , in a sense , the offices which we held ; our symbolic selves paralyzing all else within , true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suddenly appeared in that monument which Iris had become and , through the flaw , I heard again , briefly , the voice of the girl I had met on the bank of the Hudson in the spring of a lost year . " I never knew it would be like this , " she said , almost whispering , her eyes on Cave while she spoke to me . " I never thought my life would be as alone as this , all work . " " Yet you wanted it : you do want it . Direction , meaning , you wanted all that and now you have it . The magic worked , Iris . Your magician was real . " " But I sometimes wonder if I am real anymore . " The words ,  |p219though  softly spoken , fell upon my ear like rounded stones , smooth and hard . " It 's too late , " I said , mercilessly . " You are what you wanted to be . Live it out , Iris . There is nothing else . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice regaining its usual authority . " Speaking of dead , " said Cave suddenly turning toward us ( I hoped he had not heard all our conversation ) , " Stokharin here has come up with a wonderful scheme . " Even Clarissa fell silent . We all slid whenever Cave spoke which was seldom on social occasions . Cave looked cheerfullyabout the table for a moment . Stokharin beamed with pleasure at the accolade . " You 've probably all heard about the suicides as a result of Cavesword . " Cave had very early got into the habit of speakingof himself in the third person whenever a point of doctrinewas involved . " Paul 's been collecting the monthly figures and each month they double . Of course they 're not accurate since there are a good many deaths due to Cavesword which we do n't hear about . Anyway , Stokharin has perfected a painless death by poison , a new compound which kills within an hour and is delightful to take . " " I have combined certain narcotics which together insure a highly exhilarated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasies . " Stokharin smiled complacently . Cave nodded and continued . " I 've already worked out some of the practical details for putting this into action . There are still a lot of wrinkles , but we can iron them out in time . One of the big problems of present-day unorganized suicide is the mess it causes for the people unfortunate enough to be left behind . There are legal complications ; there is occasionally grief in old-fashioned family groups ; there is also a general disturbance which , though only social , still tends to leave a bad taste , giving : . aicide , at least among the reactionaries , a bad name . " Our plan is simple . We will provide at each Center full  |p220facilities  for those who have listened to Cavesword and have responded to it by taking the better way . There will be a numberof comfortable rooms where the suicidalist may receive his friends for a last visit . We 'll provide legal assistance to put his affairs in order . Not everyone of course will be worthy of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be censured and restrained . But the deserving , those whose lives have been devoted and orderly , may come to us and receive the gift . " I was appalled ; before I could control myself I had said : " But the law ! You just ca n't let people kill themselves ... " " Why not ? " Cave looked at me coldly and I saw , in the eyes of the others , concern and hostility . I had anticipated something like this ever since my talk with Paul but I had not thought it would come so swiftly or so boldly . Paul spoke for Cave . " We 've got the Congress and the Congress will make a law for us . For the time being , though , it is against the present statutes ; however , we 've been assured by our lawyers that there is n't much chance of their being invoked except perhaps in the remaining pockets of Christianitywhere we 'll go slow until we do have the necessary laws to protect us . " At that moment the line which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between me and them , became a wall apparent to everyone . Even Clarissa , my usual ally , fearlessand sharp , did not speak out . They looked at me , all of them awaiting a sign ; even Cave regarded me with curiosity . My hand shook and I was forced to seize the edge of the table to steady myself . The sensation of cold glass and iron gave me a sudden courage . I brought Cave 's life to its end . I turned to him and said , quietly , with all the firmness I could summon : " Then you 'll have to die as well as they , and soon . There was a shocked silence . Iris shut her eyes . Paul gasped and sat back abruptly in his chair . Cave turned white but he did not flinch . His eyes did not waver . They seized on mine ,  |p221terrible  and remote , full of power ; with an effort , I looked past him . I still feared his gaze . " What did you say ? " The voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension . We had reached the crisis , without a plan . " You have removed the fear of death for which future generationswill thank you , as I do . But you have gone too far ... all of you . " I looked about me at the pale faces ; a faint wisp of new moon curled in the pale sky above . " Life is to be lived until the flesh no longer supports the life within . The meaning of life , Cave , is more life , not death . The enemy of life is death , an enemy not to be feared but no less hostile for all that , no less dangerous , no less wrong when the living choose it instead of life , either for themselves or for others . You 've been able to dispel our fear of the common adversary ; that was your great work in the world . . . now you want to go further , to make love to this enemy we no longer fear , to mate with death . . . and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . " " Stop it ! " Iris 's voice was high and clear . I did not look at her . All that I could do now was to force the climax . " But sooner or later every act of human folly creates its own opposition . This will too , more soon than late , for if one can make any generality about human beings it is that they want not to die . You can not stampede them into death for long . They are enthusiastic now . They may not be soon ... unless of course there is some supreme example before them , one which you , Cave , can alone supply . You will have to die by your own hand to show the virtue and the truth of all that you have said . " I had gone as far as I could . I glanced at Iris while I spoke ; she had grown white and old-looking and , while I watched her , I realized whom it was she resembled , the obscure naggingmemory which had disturbed me all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman long dead , one whose gentle blurred features had been strikingly similar to that frightenedp222face which now stared at me as though I were a murderer . Paul was the one who answered me . " You 're out of your mind , Gene , " he said , when my meaning had at least penetrated to them all . " It does n't follow in the least that Cave must die because others want to . The main work is still ahead of him . This country is only a corner of the world . There 's some of Europe and most of Asia and Africa still ahead of us . How can you even suggest he quit now and die ? " " The work will be done whether he lives or not , as you certainly know . He 's given it the first impetus . The rest is up to the others , to the ambitious , the inspired . . . we 've met enough of them these last few years : they 're quite capable of finishing the work without us . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was suddenly relieved as the restraint of three furious years went in a rush . " I am as devoted to Cave as anyone , " I said ( and I was , I think , honest ) . " I do n't want him to die but all of you in your madness have made it impossible for him to live . He 's gone now to the limit , to the last boundary : he is the son of death and each of you supports him . I do n't , for it was only my wish to make life better , not death desirable . I never really believed it would come to this : that you , Cave , would speak out for death , against life . " I raised my eyes to his . To my astonishment he had lowered his lids as though to hide from me , to shut me out . His head was shaking oddly from left to right and his lips were pressed tight together . I struck again , without mercy . " But do n't stop now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , build palaces if you like for those who choose to die in your name . But remember that you will be their victim , too . The victim of their passionate trust . They will force you to lead the way and you must be death 's lover , Cave . " He opened his eyes and I was shocked to see them full of tears . " I 'm not afraid , " he said.  |p223A  few days after our disastrous dinner , Clarissa came to me in my office . It was our first real meeting since her return from Europe . It was also my first meeting with any one of the directors for , since the scene on the penthouse terrace , none had come near me , not even Paul whom I usually saw at least once a day . Clarissa seemed tired but fashionable in summer lace . She sat down heavily in the chair beside my desk and looked at me oddly . " Recriminations ? " I asked cheerfully : the recent outburst had restored me to perfect health and equanimity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're an absolute fool and you know it , " she said at last . " I suppose there are wires in here , recording everything we say . " " I should n't be surprised . Fortunately , I have no secrets . " " There 's no doubt of that , " she glared at me . " There was no need to rush things . " " You mean you anticipated this ? " " What else ? Where else could it lead ? The same thing  |p224ha|p|pened  to Christ , you know . They kept pushing him to claim the kingdom . Finally , they pushed too hard and he was killed . It was the killing which perpetuated the legend . " " And a number of other things . " " In any case , it 's all gone too far . Also , I do n't think you even begin to see what you 've done . " " Done ? I 've merely brought the whole thing into the open ... as well as put myself on record as being opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course is nonsense . Just because a few nitwits . . . " " A few ? Have you seen the statistics ? Every month there are a few hundred more and as soon as Stokharin gets his damned roadhouses for would-be suicides going we may find that ... " " I always assumed Paul made up the statistics . But even if they are true , even if a few hundred thousand people decide to slip away every year , I am in favor of it . There are too many people as it is and most of them are n't worth the room they take up . I suspect all this is just one of nature 's little devices to reduce the population . . . like pederasty on those Greek islands . " " You 're outrageous . " " I 'm perfectly rational which is more than I can say for you . Anyway , the reason I 've come to see you today is , first , to warn you and , second , to say good-by . " " Good-by ? You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " Not in a hundred years . . . though I must say lately I 've begun to feel old . No , I 'm going away . I 've told Paul that I 've had my fun , that you 're all on your own and that I want no part of what 's to come . " " Where will you go ? " " Who knows ? Now for the warning : Paul of course is furious at you and so is Iris . " " Perfectly understandable . What did he say ? " " Nothing good . I talked to him this morning . I wo n't enrage  |p225you  by repeating all the expletives ; it 's enough to say he 's eager to get you out of the way . He feels you 've been a malcontentall along . " " He 'll have trouble getting me to take Stokharin 's magic pill . " " He may not leave it up to you , " said Clarissa significantly , and , inadvertently , I shuddered . I had of course wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but the matter-offactClarissa enlightened me . " Watch out for him , especially if he becomes friendly . You must remember that with the country Cavite and with Paul in charge of the organization you have n't much chance . " " I 'll take what I have . " Clarissa looked at me without , I could see , much hope ; it was disagreeable . " What you do n't know , and this is my last good deed for in a sense I 'm responsible for getting you into this , is that you accidentally gave the game away . " " What do you mean ? " " I mean that Paul has been planning for over a year to do away with Cave . He feels that Cave 's usefulness is over ; he 's also uneasy about letting him loose in the world . Paul wants full control of the establishment and he ca n't have it while Cave lives . Paul also realizes . . . he 's much cleverer than you 've ever thought , by the way . . . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously Cave 's suicide is the answer . It is Paul 's intention either to get Cave to kill himself or else to do it for him and then announce that Cave , of his own free will , chose to die . " I had the brief sensation of a man drowning . " How do you know all this ? " " I have two eyes ; also , Iris told me . " " She knows too ? " " Of course she knows ! Why else do you think she 's so anxious to get Cave away from this place ? She knows Paul can have him killed at any time and no one would be the wiser . I grunted with amazement : I understood now what it was  |p226that  had happened on the terrace . I felt a perfect fool . Of them all I alone had been unaware of what was going on beneath the surface and , in my folly , I had detonated the situation without knowing it . " He knows too ? " I asked weakly . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Paul . " " Why has no one ever told me this ? Clarissa shrugged . " They had no idea which side you 'd take . They still do n't know . Paul believes that you are with him and though he curses you for an impetuous fool , he 's decided that perhaps it 's a good idea now to bring all this into the open , at least among ourselves . He hopes for a majority vote in the directors ' meeting to force Cave to kill himself . " " And Cave ? " " Has no wish to die . . . sensible man . " " I am a fool . " " What I 've always told you , dear . " Clarissa smiled at me . " I will say , though , that you are the only one of the lot who has acted for an impersonal reason , and certainly none of them understands you except me . I am on your side , in a way . Voluntary deaths do n't alarm me the way they do you but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life may have ghastly consequences . " " What can I do ? " " I have n't the faintest idea . It 's enough that you were warned in advance . " " What would you do ? " " Exactly what I 'm going to do : pull out for good and take a long trip . " " I mean if you were I. " She sighed . " Save your life , if possible ; that 's all you can do . " " I have a few weapons , you know . I have the Journal and I 'm a director . I have friends in every Center . " This was almosttrue . I had made a point of knowing as many Residents as possible . " I also have Iris and Cave on my side since I'mp227willing to do all I can to keep him alive , that he not become a supreme symbol . " " I wish you luck , " Clarissa was most cynical . She rose " Now that I 've done my bit of informing , I 'm off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . But I will tell you I wo n't go back there : they 've gone quite mad too . In Madrid I pretended to be a Catholic and I watched them put Cavites up before firing squads . Of course our people , despite persecution , are having a wonderfully exciting time with passwords and peculiar college fraternity handclasps and so on . " She collected her gloves and handbag from the floor where , as usual , she had strewn them . " Well , now good-by . " She gave me a kiss ; then she was gone . I never saw her again . Events moved rapidly . I took to bolting my bedroom door at night and , during the day , I was careful always to have one or another of my assistants near me . It was a strange sensation to be living in a modern city with all its police and courts and yet to fear that , in a crisis , there would be no succor , no one to turn to for aid and protection . We were a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day after Clarissa had said good-by , Paul appeared in my office . I was surrounded by editors but at a look from him and a gesture from me they withdrew . We had each kept our secret , evidently , for none of those close to us in that building suspected that there had been a fatal division . " I seem to be in disgrace , " I said , my forefinger delicately caressing the buzzer which I had built into the arm of my chair so that I might summon aid in the event that a visitor proved to be either a bore or a maniac , two types curiously drawn to enterprises such as ours . " I would n't say that . " Paul sat in a chair close to my own ; I recall thinking , a little madly , that elephants are supposed to be at their most dangerous when they are quite still . Paul wasp228noticeably controlled . Usually he managed to cross the room at least once for every full sentence ; now he sat looking at me , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since our dinner except Clarissa , " I explained ; then I added , earnestly : " I wonder where she plans to go . She did n't . . . " " You 've almost wrecked everything , " he said , his voice tight , unfamiliar in its tension . " I did n't want to , " I said , inaccurately . I was at the moment more terrified than I 'd ever been , either before or since . I could get no real grip on him : the surface he presented me was as formidable , as granitic as a prison wall . " Who told you ? Iris ? Cave ? or were you spying ? " Each question was fired at me like a bullet . " Spying on whom ? " " On me , damn you ! " Then it broke . The taut line of control which had held in check his anger and his fear broke all at once and the torrent flowed , reckless and overpowering : " You meddling idiot ! You spied on me ; you found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things by springing it like that . Well , you failed . " I recall thinking , quite calmly , how much I preferred his face in the congested ugliness of rage to its ordinary banality of expression . I was relieved , too , by the storm . I could handle him when he was out of control . I considered my counteroffensive while he shouted at me , accusedme of hostility to him , of deviationism from Cavesword and of numerous other crimes . He stopped , finally , for lack of breath . " I gather , " I said , my voice shaking a little from excitement , " that at some point recently you decided that Cave should apply Cavesword to himself and die , providing us with a splendid example , an undying ( I mean no pun ) symbol . " " You know you found out and decided to get in on the act , to force my hand . Now he 'll never do it . " That was it then . I was relieved to be no longer in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You bet your sweet life he has . " Paul was beginning to  |p229recover  his usual poise . " Your little scene gave him the excuse he needed : Gene 's right . ' " Paul imitated Cave 's voice with startling accuracy and malice . " Gene 's right . I never did mean for everybody to kill themselves off . .. where 'd the world be if that happened ? Just a few people . That 's all . ' And he 's damned if he 's going to be one of them . Hate to set that sort of example . ' " " Well , you 'll have to try something else then . " " Why did you do it ? " Paul 's voice became petulant . " Did Iris put you up to it ? " " Nobody put me up to it . " " You mean to sit there and try to make me believe that it just occurred to you , like that , to suggest Cave would have to kill himself if he encouraged suicide ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I looked at Paul with vivid loathing . " Ca n't you understand even the obvious relationship between cause and effect ? With this plan of Stokharin 's you 'll make it impossible for Cave not to commit suicide and , when be does , you will have an international death cult which I shall do my best to combat . " Paul 's hands began nervously to play with his tie , his lapels : I wondered if he 'd conic armed . I placed my finger lightly upon the buzzer . Implacably , we faced one another . " You are not truly Cavesword " was all that he said . " We wo n't argue about that . I 'm merely explaining to you why I said what I did and why I intend to keep Cave alive as long as possible . Alive and hostile to you , to your peculiar interpretation of his word . " Paul looked suddenly disconsolate . " I 've ( lone what I thought best . I feel Cave should show us all the way . I feel it 's both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life publicly . " " But he does n't want to . " " That is the part I ca n't understand . Cavesword is that death is not to be feared but embraced yet he , the man who has really changed the world , refuses to die . " " Perhaps he feels he has more work to do . More places to  |p230see  . Perhaps , Paul , he does n't trust you . . . does n't want to leave you in control of the Establishment . " " I 'm willing to get out if that 's all that 's stopping him . " But the insincerity of this protestation was too apparent for either of us to contemplate for long . " I do n't care what his motives are . I do n't care if he himself is terrified of dying ( and I have a hunch that that is the real reason for his hesitancy ) but I do know that I do n't want him dead by his own hand . " " You 're quite sure of that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Establishment and do n't forget it , Paul : it 's Iris , Cave and I against you and Stokharin . You may control the organization but we have Cave himself . " I gathered courage in my desperation . I purposelysounded as though I were in warm concert with the others . " I realize all that . " Paul was suddenly meek , conciliatory , sublimely treacherous . " But you must allow me as much sincerityas you withhold for yourself . I want to do what 's best . I think he should die and I 've done everything to persuade him . He was near agreement when you upset everything . " " For which I 'm happy . . . though it was something of an accident . Are you sure that it is only for the sake of Caveswordyou want him dead ? " " What other possible reason ? " He looked at me indignantly . I could not be sure whether he was telling the truth or not . I doubted it . " Many other reasons . For one thing you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that of course is something worth inheriting . " Paul shrugged convincingly . " I 'm as much in charge now as I would be with him dead , " he said with a certain truth . " I 'm interested in Cavesword , not in Cave . If his death enhancesand establishes the Word more securely then I must do all I can to convince him to take that course . " " There is another way , " I said , smiling at the pleasant thought.  | " Another way ? " " To convince us of your dedication and sincerity to Caves-word . " " What 's that ? " " You kill yourself , Paul . " There was a long silence . I pressed the buzzer and my secretarycame in . Without a word , Paul left . Immediately afterwards , I took the private elevator to Cave 's penthouse . Two guards stopped me while I was announced by a third . After a short delay , I was admitted to Cave 's study , but not to Cave ; instead , Iris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Where is he ? " " Obviously you do . " I lcr voice was cold . She did not askme to sit down . Awkwardly , I faced her at the room 's center . " We must stop him . " " John ? Stop him from what ? " " Doing what Paul wants him to do . " " And what you want as well . " " You 're mistaken . I thought I made myself clear the other night . But though my timing was apparently bad , under no circumstances do I want him to die . " " You made your speech to force him . " " And Paul thinks I made it to stop him . " I could n't help smiling . " I am , it seems , everyone 's enemy . " " Paul has told me everything . How you and he and Stokharinall decided , without consulting us , that John should die . " I was astonished at Paul 's boldness . Could he really be moving so swiftly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her quickly , urgently what I felt , what I had said to Paul and he to me . She heard me to the end without expressing either belief or disbelief . When I 'd finished she turned away from me and went to the window where , through yellow glass , the city rose upon the band of horizon . " It 's too late , " she said , evenly . " I had n't expected this . Perhaps you 're telling me the truth . . . if you are , you 've made a terrible mistake . " She turned about suddenly , with ap232precision which was almost military . " He 's going to do it . " The awful words fell like a weight upon a scale . I felt blindly for a chair and sat down , all strength gone . " Stop him , " I said , all that I could say . " Stop him . " " It 's too late for that . " She took pity on me . " I think you 're telling me the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting and looked down at me gently . " I 'm sorry I accused you . I should have realized Paul was lying . " You can stop him . " " I ca n't . I 've tried but I ca n't . " Her control was extraordinary . I did not then guess the reason for her calm , her strength . " Then I must try . " I stood up . She backed away at the expression on my face . " You ca n't do anything . He wo n't see you . He wo n't see anyone but me . " " I thought he told Paul he agreed with me , that he did n't want to . . . to countenance all this , that he ... " " At first he took your side , if it is really what you yourself feel : then he thought about it and . . . this morning he decided to go ahead with Paul 's plan . " I was confused . " Does Paul know ? " Iris smiled wanly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must do without Paul 's assistance . " " Or knowledge ? " Iris shrugged . " Paul will find out about it this evening , I suppose . There will be an announcement . John 's secretary is getting it ready now . . . one for the public and another for the Establishment . " " When will it happen ? " " Tomorrow . I go with him , Gene . " " You ? You 're not going to die too ? " " I do n't see that it makes much difference what I do when John dies . " " You ca n't leave us now . You ca n't leave Paul in charge of everything . He 's a dangerous man . Why , if . . . " " You 'll be able to handle him . " It was perfectly apparent  |p233to  me that she was no longer interested in me or in the others ; not even in the fate of the work we had begun . " It 's finished , if you go too , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd not last ten days . Iris , let me talk to him . " " I ca n't . I wo n't . " I contemplated pushing by her and searching the penthouse but there were guards everywhere and I had no wish to be shot myself on such an errand . She guessed my thought and said , quickly " There 's no possibleway for you or anyone to get through to him . Sometime tonight or tomorrow he will leave and that 's the end . " " He wo n't do it here ? " This surprised me . She shook her head . " He wants to go off alone , away from everyone . I 'm to be with him until the end ; then I 'll send the body back here for burial . . . but he 'll leave full instruc-tions . " " You mean I 'm never to see either of you again ? Just like that , you both go ? " " Just like this . " For the first time she displayed some warmth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said gently . " I even think that of us all you were the one most nearly right in your approach to John . I think you understood him better than he did himself . Try to hold on after we go . Try to keep it away from Paul . " " As if I could ! " I turned from her bitterly , filled with unexpectedgrief : I did not want to lose her presence even though I had lost her or , rather , never possessed more of her than that one bright instant years before on the California coast when we had both realized with the unexpected clarity of the lovers we were not that our lives had come to the same point at the same moment and the knowledge of this confluence was the one splendor I had known , the single hope , the unique passionof my life . " Do n't miss me , Gene . I could n't bear that . " She put her hand on my arm . I walked away , not able to bear her touch . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped and stepped back when she saw them . I spun about just as Paul shouted : " It wo n't work , Iris ! Give it up . " " Get out of here , Paul . " Her voice was strong . " You have no right here . " " I have as much right as you . Now tell me whose idea was it ? yours ? or was it John 's ? or Gene 's ? since he seems to enjoy playing both sides . " " Get out . All of you . " She moved to the old-fashioned bell cord which hung beside Cave 's massive desk . " Do n't bother , " said Paul . " No one will come . " Iris , her eyes wide now with fear , tugged the cord twice : the second time it broke off in her hand . There was no response . Paul looked grim . " I 'm sorry to have to do it this way but you 've left me no choice . You ca n't leave , either of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the release . It wo n't work . " " Why not ? It 's what you 've wanted all along . Everything will be yours . There 'll be nobody to stop you . John will be dead and I 'll be gone for good . You 'll never see me again .. . why must you interfere ? " She spoke quickly , plausibly but the false proportion was evident now , even to me : the plan was tumbling down at Paul 's assault . " Iris , I 'm not a complete fool . I know perfectly well that Cave has no intention of killing himself and that . . . " " Why do you think I 'm going with him ? to send you the body back for the ceremony which you 'll perform right here , publicly ... " " Iris . " He looked at her for a long moment . Then : " If you two leave as planned tonight ( I 've canceled the helicopter by the way ) there will be no body , no embalming , no ceremony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well undo all our work . I ca n't allow that . Cave must die here , before morning . We might have put it off but your announcement has already leaked out . There 'll be a million people out there in the street tomorrow . We 'll have to show them Cave 's body . "  |p235Iris  swayed ; I moved quickly to her side and held her arm . " It 's three to two , Paul , " I said . " I assume we 're still directors . Three of us have agreed that Cave and Iris leave . That 's final . " But my bluff was humiliatingly weak ; it was ignored . " The penthouse , " said Paul softly , " is empty . . . just the five of us here . The Doctor and I are armed . Take us in to him . " " No . " Iris moved instinctively , fatally , to the door which led to Cave , as if to guard it with her body . There was a brief scuffle which ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns . With an apology , Stokharin pushed us through the door . In a small sunroom we found Cave sitting before a television screen , watching the installation of a new Resident in Boston . He looked up with surprise at our entrance . " I thought I said . . . " he began but Iris interrupted him . " They want to kill you , John . " He got to his feet quickly , his face pale and his eyes glaring . Even Paul was shaken by that glance . " You read my last statement ? " Cave spoke sharply , without apparent fear . " That 's why we 've come , " said Paul ; he and Stokharin moved , as though by previous accord , to opposite ends of the little room , leaving the three of us together , vulnerable at its center . " You must do it here . " Paul signaled Stokharin who , after some fumbling , produced a small metal box which he tossed to Cave . " Some of the new pills , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer layer and . .. " " Take it , John . " " I 'll get some water , " said Stokharin ; but Paul waved to him to keep his place . Cave smiled whitely . " I will not take it . Now both of you get out of here before I call the guards . " " No more guards , " said Paul . " We 've seen to that . Now , please , do n't make it any more difficult than it is . Take the pill . " " If you read my statement you know that . . . "  | " You intend to take a pleasant trip around the world incognitowith Iris . Yes , I know . As your friend , I wish you could do it . But , for one thing , sooner or later you 'd be recognized and , for another , we must have proof . . . we must have a body . " " Iris will bring the body back , " said Cave . He was still quite calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing more to be said . You 'll have the Establishment all to yourself and I will be a most satisfactory figure upon which to build a world religion . " It was the only time in my experience with Cave that I ever heard him strike the ironic note . " Leave us alone , Paul . You have what you want . Now let us go . " Iris begged but Paul had no eyes for anyone but Cave . " Take it , John , " he repeated softly . " Take Cavesway . " " Not for you . " Cave hurled the metal box at Paul 's head and Stokharin fired . There was one almost bland moment when we all stood , politely , in a circle and watched Cave , a look of wonder on his face , touch his shoulder where the blood had begun to flow through a hole in the jacket . Then Iris turned fiercely on Paul , knocking him off balance , while Cave ran to the door . Stokharin , his hand shaking and his face silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cave who quivered but did not fall ; instead , he got through the door and into the study . As Stokharin hurried after him , I threw myself upon him , expecting death at any moment ; but it did not come for Stokharin had collapsed . He dropped his gun and hid his face in his hands , rocking back and forth on the floor , sobbing . Paul , free of Iris 's fierce grip , got to Cave before I did . By then it was finished . Cave lay in the corridor only a few feet from the elevator . He 'd fallen on his face and lay now in his own blood , his hands working at the floor as though trying to dig himself a grave in the hard stone . I turned him on his back and he opened his eyes . " Iris ? " he asked . His voice was ordinary though his breathing was harsh , uneven . " Here I am . " She knelt down beside him , ignoring Paul  |p237who  stood looking down at them , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cave whispered something to Iris ; then a flow of blood , like the full moon 's tide , poured from his mouth and he was dead . " Cavesway , " said Paul at last when the silence had been used up : the phrase he had prepared for this moment , inadequate to the reality at our feet . " Your way , " said Iris as she got to her feet . She looked at Paul calmly , as though they 'd met only at that moment . " Your way , " she repeated . In the other room Stokharin moaned.  |p238Now  the work was complete . Cavesword and Cavesway formed a perfect design and all the rest would greatly follow . . . or so Paul assumed . I believe if I had been he I should have killed both Iris and myself the same day , removing at one stroke witnesses and opposition . But he did not have the courageand , too , I think he underestimated us , to his own future sorrow . Iris and I were left alone in the penthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm , bundled Cave 's body into a blanket and then , with the doctor 's help , put it upon the private elevator . The next twenty-four hours were a grim carnival . The body of Cave , beautifully arranged and painted , lay in the central auditorium of the center as thousands filed by to see him . Paul 's speech over the corpse was telecast around the world . Iris and I kept to our separate rooms , both by choice and from necessity since gentle guards stood before our doors and refused , apologetically , to let us out.  |p239I  watched the services over television while my chief editors visited me one by one unaware of what had happened , ignoring the presence of the guards . It was assumed that I was too shocked by grief to go to the office . Needless to say , I did not mention to any of them what had happened . At first I had thought it best to expose Paul as a murderer and a fraud but , on second thought ( the second thought which followed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt assumed it would ) , I did not want to risk the ruin of our work . Instead , I decided to wait , to study Paul 's destruction , an event which I had grimly vowed would take place as soon as possible . He could not now get rid of either Iris or me in the near future and all we needed , I was sure , was but a week or two . I was convinced of this though I had no specific plan . Iris had more influence , more prestige in the Establishment than Paul , and I figured , correctly as later events corroborated , that Cave 's death would enhance her position . As for myself , I was not without influence . I kept my lines of communication clear the next few days during what was , virtually , a house-arrest . The editors came to me regularly and I continued to compose editorials . The explanation for my confinement to my room was , according to a bulletin signed by Stokharin , a mild heart condition . Everyonewas most kind . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Stokharin 's pellets in my food and death would be ascribed to coronary occlusion , the result of the strain attendant upon Cave 's death . I had less time than I thought . I made plans . Paul 's funeral oration was competent though less than inspiring . The Chief Resident of Dallas , one of the great new figures of the Establishment , made an even finer speech over the corpse . I listened attentively , judging from what was said and what was not said the wind 's direction : it was quite obvious that Cavesway was to be the heart of the doctrine . Death was to be embraced with passion ; life was the criminal ; death the better reality ; consciousness was an evil which , in death 's oblivion , met its true fate . . . man 's one perfectp240virtuous act was the sacrifice of his own consciousness to the pure nothing from which , by grim accident , it had come , a malignancy in creation . The Chief Resident of Dallas was most eloquent , and chilling . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitementwhich circled the globe like a lightning storm . Thirtyfivehundred suicides were reported within forty-eight hours of Cave 's death . The statisticians lost count of the number of people who fought to get inside the building to see Cave in death . From my window , however , I could see that Park Avenue had been roped off for a dozen blocks . People , like ants , swarmed toward the gates of the tower . I sent messages to Iris but received none , nor , for that matter , did I have any assurance that she had got mine . Paul 's adventuresI followed on television and from the reports of my editors who visited me regularly , despite Stokharin 's orders . On the third day , I was allowed to go to my office : Paul having decided that it would be thought odd if I were to die so soon after Cave and , too , he was no doubt relieved to discover that I had not revealed to my friends what actually had happened . Having established the fact of my weak heart , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not see him face to face until the fourth day , when John Cave 's ashes were to be distributed over the United States . Stokharin , Paul and I sat in the back seat of a limousineat the head of a motorcade which , beginning at the tower , terminated at the airport where the jet-plane which would sprinkle the ashes over New York , Seattle , Chicago and Los Angeles was waiting , along with a vast crowd and the President of the United States , an official Christian but known to incline , as Presidents do , toward the majority . . . Cavites were the majority and had been for almost two years . I was startled to find Paul and Stokharin in the same automobile . It had been my understanding that we were to travel separately in the motorcade . They were most cordial . " Sorry to hear you 've been sick , Gene , " Paul grinned ingenuously . " Must n't strain the old ticker. "  | " I 'm sure the good doctor will be able to cure me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then the car pulled away from the tower and drove down Park Avenue at the head of a long procession . Crowds lined the street as we drove slowly by . They were curiously still , as though they hardly knew how to react : this was a funeral yet Cavesway was glorious . Some cheered ; most simply stared and pointed at our car , recognizing Paul . I suddenly realized why they were so interested in this particular car : on the floor , at Paul 's feet , was what looked like a large flower pot covered with gold foil . " Are those the ashes ? " Paul nodded . " Did an extra quick job , too , I 'm glad to say . We did n't want any slip up . " " Where 's Iris ? " " I was going to ask you that . " Paul looked at me sharply . " She disappeared yesterday and it 's very embarrassing for all of us , very inconsiderate too : she knew I especially wanted her at the ceremony . She knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think she took the idea of Cavesway most illogically , " said Stokharin , his usual sang-froid had returned , his breakdown forgotten . " She should be grateful to us for making all this possible , despite Cave 's weakness . " I ignored Stokharin . I looked at Paul who was beaming at the crowd , acknowledging their waves with nods of his head . " What will you do now ? " You heard the ceremony ? " " Yes . " " Well , just that . Cavesway has become universal . Even the economists in Washington have privately thanked us for what we 're doing to reduce the population . There 's a theory that by numerous voluntary deaths wars might decrease since . . . or so the proposition goes . . . they are nature 's way of checkingpopulation . " " Perhaps you 're right . " I assumed a troubled expression as I made the first move of my counteroffensive.  |p242Paul  looked away from the crowd to regard me briefly , shrewdly . " You do n't think I trust you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? I ca n't change Cavesway now . " Paul grunted . I could see that he did not believe this spuriousvolte-face ; nevertheless , an end to my active opposition would force him to revise his plans ; this would , I hoped , give me the time I needed . I pressed on : " I think we can compromise . Short of rigging my death which would cause suspicion , you must continue to put up with me for a while . You 've nothing to fear from me since you control the Establishment and since the one weapon I have against you I will not use . " You mean . . . " " My having witnessed the murder of Cave . If I had wanted to I could have revealed this before the cremation . An autopsy would certainly have ruined everything for you . " " Why did n't you ? " I could see that Paul was genuinely interested in my motives . " Because it would have meant the end of the work . I saw no reason to avenge Cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a god to me , any more than you are . " This twist of a blunt knife had the calculated effect : " What a cold devil you are ! " said Paul , almost admiringly . " I wish I could believe you . " " There 's no reason not to . I was opposed to the principle of suicide . It is now firmly established . We must go on from there . " " Then tell me where Iris is . " " I have n't any idea . As you know , I 've been trying to get in touch with her for days ; your people intercepted everything . How did she manage to get away ? " " One of the guards let her out . I thought he was one of our boys but it seems she worked on him and he left with her . I 've alerted all the Centers ; so far no one 's seen her . " Just before Grand Central Station , the crowd began to roar with excitement and Paul held up the jar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went wild and tried to break through the police lines . The cortege drove a bit faster andp243Paul set the ashes down ; he looked triumphant but tired , as though he 'd not slept in a month : one eyelid , I saw , was twitchingwith fatigue . " When are we to have a directors ' meeting ? " I asked as we crossed the bridge which spanned the Hudson . We 're still legally a company . We must elect a new board chairman . " " As soon as we find Iris , " said Paul . " I think we should all be there , do n't you ? Two to two . " " Perhaps three to one on the main things , " I said , allowing this to penetrate , aware that his quick mind would study all the possibilities and arrive at a position so subtle and unexpectedas to be of use to me if I , in turn , were quick enough to seize my opportunity . At the airport , a detachment of airborne troops were drawn up before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incongruous marches while in the center of the stand , surrounded by cameras and dignitaries , stood the smilingPresident of the United States . The next day while I was examining the various accounts of the last ceremony , the chief editor came into my office , his face blazing with excitement : " Iris Mortimer ! " was all he could say . " Iris ? Where ? " " Dallas . " He exploded the name in exhalation ; then he told me : word had come from our office there that Iris had , a few hours before , denounced Paul for having ignored Cave 's last wishes to be embalmed and that , as a result of this and other infidelities to Cavesword , she , as ranking director and with the full concurrence of the Chief Resident of Dallas , was calling a Council of Residents to be held the following week at Dallas to determine the future course of the Establishment . I almost laughed aloud with pleasure . I had not believed she would show such vigor and daring . I had feared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended with Cave . . . even at my most optimistic , I had not dreamed
