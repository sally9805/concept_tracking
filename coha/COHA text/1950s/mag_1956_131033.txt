A DUEL ON THE SEA // Off the coast of Florida , baseball 's Ted Williams and golf 's Sam Snead sail forth in a fight for fish // Ted Williams , the finest natural hitter in baseball , and Sam Snead , the finest natural hitter in golf , got around to settling a long-standing dispute : Who is the better fisherman ? The wrangle began when Williams returned from Korea to hear that Snead , Williams ' partner in a tackle company , had set the record for the biggest bonefish ever caught on a 12-pound test line . Williams quipped , " Why I 've caught more fish than Sam has missed short putts . " To back up his claim , Williams challenged Snead to a two-day sailfishing contest . Last month , working from separate boats off West Palm Beach , Williams and Snead fought their " grudge match . " On the first morning Williams caught one sail , but Snead landed two in the afternoon to take the lead . " Say , Bush , " inquired Sam that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you hit to left field ? " Early in the second day , Snead caught three more to take a 5-1 lead . In the late afternoon , Ted came on fast when he hooked sails on two rods ( above ) and landed them while Sam watched from his boat . But that was the ball game . The score : Snead 5 , Williams 3 ; or , to put it Sam 's way : Snead 2 up . // One for the hat ( a sailfish , that is ) leaps from the water in an attempt to shake free from Fisherman Snead. // ONE MAN 'S ESPERANTO // One of the ranking gypsies in the peripatetic world of golf is Paul Hahn , a young , high-geared , personable ex-circuit pro who is generally regarded as the greatest trick-shot golfer since Joe Kirkwood , the Australian who founded the profession . A few months ago , after having previously restricted his travels to Hawaii , the Caribbean countries and 45 of the 48 states , Hahn undertook his first large-scale international exhibition tour .

" I discovered no one is exaggerating when they claim golf is an international language , " Hahn says . " I played on all sorts of courses with all kinds of caddies but , as Bob Hope put it , I never left home . " // Japanese girl Caddie carries a shoulder bag containing a mixture of dirt , grass seed and fertilizer with which she is instantly able to refill all of course 's divot holes . // HAHN PERFORMS HIS STUFF IN A SETTING THAT HAS ALL THE HALLMARKS OF HAPPY KNOLL BUT IS IN REALITY THE HONG KONG GOLF CLUB LOCATED ONLY THREE MILES FROM RED CHINA // At Royal Bagdad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hahn 's colossal golf bag receives a jubilant riding from his fellow caddies .
