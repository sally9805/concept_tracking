OUR ex-troopship , eight days out of New York , bore no resemblance to the Narcissus of Joseph Conrad . But as I stood on the wet deck in the half-dawn of that first postwar spring and watched the dark landfall ride over the rim of the English Channel , I thought of his salute to the " mother of fleets and nations . " The Britain I was meeting for the first time needed no better introduction than those fullrigged phrases of the Anglo-Polish sailor and novelist : " Guarding priceless traditions and untold suffering . . . The great flagship of the race ; stronger than the storms ! and anchored in the open sea . " All that forenoon we drove up-Channel like a China clipper with fresh tea in her hold ; tiny fishing trawlers bounced from our bow wave . Aboard our transport , still in her war paint , were haggard , homesick Britishers newly freed from Japanese prison camps . The Britain I watched passing to port was like our ship , still in battle gray . Every misty headland bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft carrier and two destroyers challenged and blinked us by , The sea air was chilly as a sentry . Sea Watchdogs Guard Approaches At the turn southeast of the Isle of Wight we met Britain 's reception committee ? a phalanx of sea-bed forts and fighting ships . Like uncounted thousands of vessels before us , we followed the tide into Southampton Water by permission of the watchdogs of Spithead and Portsmouth ( map , page 515 ) . That was my first sight of salty old Portsmouth , or " Pompey " as the sailors call it , single-minded base for a maritime power whose heart pulses with the beat of the sea . Since then , as if by a whirlpool , I have been drawn back many times by Portsmouth 's harbor and history , its fleet and its tides . In six years of seeing this naval base in all moods and weathers , I have come to respect the Royal Navy 's steadfastness in " guarding priceless traditions " as one of the few reliable beacons left in a storm-tossed world . On the eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , I stood with my friends Lt. Col. and Mrs. Harold Wyllie on the windy balcony of their Ship Tyger Flat at the top of Tower House , overhanging the narrow tide-ruffled entrance to Portsmouth Harbour . Within the circle swept by our telescope I could see all the panoply of centuries of sea power contained in one great panorama . Veterans of Korea and Trafalgar Some three miles to the southwest , down the path of the low winter sun , the light fleet aircraft carrier Theseus , not long returned from battle in Korean waters , lay at anchor in Spithead . Near by , black against the somber blue of the Isle of Wight 's hills , a big new aircraft carrier , H.M.S. Eagle , was practice-catapulting her first brood of fighters . A few cables farther on swung the carrier Karel Doorman , once H.M.S. Venerable , purchased from Britain by the Dutch ? Britannia 's foe of old , now long a staunch ally . High above us , vapor wakes from invisible jet planes congealed in the icy air . Fifty feet beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steel-blue submarine , swinging hard over to cross the tide into Haslar Lake , flipped her wash against the base of the tower . At the Royal Dockyard jetty , a pistol shot to leeward of the harbor entrance , the carrier H.M.S. Warrior had been loading troops and supplies for a fast run to Middle East trouble zones a few weeks earlier . There now lay H.M.S. Indomitable , carrier flagship of the Commander in Chief of the Home Fleet . Between us and Indomitable a constant stream of water traffic eddied in the half-mile triangle bounded by the Dockyard , the harbor entrance , and Gosport Hard ( page 524 ) . Cross-harbor ferries ran so uninterruptedly that tars and workmen seemed to catch them on the fly , leaping from quay to bobbing boat like pieces of scrap to a moving magnet . Housewives with their shopping baskets were as nimble as the sailors and workmen . Weaving in and out through the commercial traffic , the little boats of the Royal Navy were using the crowded water to teach handling and discipline . On even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making their vessel look its smartest . Helmsmen of craft dodging the nearest neighbor barely had time to sigh with relief before another converging vessel raised a new and tougher traffic problem . All about us a thousand hooters , signal flags , flashing lights , and speeding picket boats exposed the sleepless nerves of Britain 's senior dockyard and pre-eminent naval base . In the very center of all this white-waked hustle and welding-torch glitter of a keyed-up command post rose the checkerboard strakes , scarlet gun ports , and noble stern cabins of two wooden sailing ships as eloquent as battle standards in giving the fourth dimension of time to the wintry glories of the scene . Lord Nelson 's full-rigged Victory , shored up in Britain 's oldest graving dock , flew at the main the St. George 's cross flag of the Commander in Chief , Portsmouth . Across the harbor on the Gosport side , afloat but stripped of masts and rigging , lay the 134-yearold Bombay-built frigate Foudroyant ( page 520 ) . Even more than the great modern carriers , these two timbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invocation : Rule , Britannia ! Britannia rule the waves ! Britons never , never , never will be slaves . Victory ? whose keel was laid down in 1759 , seventeen years before the American Colonies declared their independence ? had survived her latest war in accustomed Navy fashion :  |p515  stripped for action and with Nelson 's " duty " signal flying . On the night of March 10 , 1941 , a German bomb landed squarely on the floor of Victory 's dry dock , under the ship 's port bow . Seasoned English oak fared better than steel and concrete ; the hole in the ship was smaller than the crater in the dock . When the stone residence of the Commander in Chief , Portsmouth , was blown apart , that gentleman calmly moved to Nelson 's old quarters aboard Victory and thereafter rode the war out in considerably more comfort than the Luftwaffe . Unless another war strips her for action again , Victory 's proud spars will remain among the loftiest in all Portsmouth . The postwar job of re-rigging her took nearly three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spliced and knotted to patterns and commands which have virtually disappeared from the sea 's manuals and glossaries . My host , Colonel Wyllie , an expert on the old sailing Navy , acted for the Society for Nautical Research in advising the Dockyard on the task . Not a single bend , hitch , splice , whipping , or serving is less than perfect ; for while the catspaw of courses slowly rose again tier upon tier , the riggers knew that leveled telescopes from the big ships ' bridges and from Tower House were focusing on every knot . There  |p516  are no perfectionists surpassing those who served and still worship the old Navy of sail . Victory today silently tells much about the way the discipline of perfection was learned through that century of sea fighting up to and through Trafalgar . The several hundred seamen then aboard her slung their hammocks by the guns they served . In view of the limited headroom below , any over five feet seven inches tall must have developed a permanent stoop or knockproof head . Only with neck bowed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decks and past the darkened orlop and magazine to the tree-sized keel . It was easy to understand why the custom arose of allowing officers to remain seated to toast the sovereign 's health ; but I wondered what Nelson 's Capt . Thomas M. Hardy , an uncommonly tall man , saw in a naval career . Right up to Nelson 's day , interiors of the King 's ships were painted a single color : scarlet . It meant that they were ever ready for blood , with oakum and salt beef always at hand for stopping shot holes in either the ship 's hull or a seaman 's powder-blackened hide . Colonel Wyllie is now supervising the restoration of Foudroyant . Through the telescope I watched craftsmen of an almost forgotten art at work on the canted and curiously carved frames for the cabin lights on each quarter . " Is n't she beautiful ? " he asked . " There is the last surviving fighting ship of the old sailing Navy still afloat . " Foudroyant was built in Bombay dockyard in 1817 as H.M.S. Trincomalee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Parsis who made a religion of their fine workmanship . Up to her main deck she is still the same ship which saw forty years of service in the active fleet . " If we are successful in raising a ? 60,000 endowment fund to keep her shipshape , we can continue giving training courses aboard her , in boat handling and character building , to ships ' companies of a hundred boys or girls at a time . " You have seen the past in Victory , and you witness the present all about you in the ships refitting here after service in Korea , Suez , and  |p517  wherever else Britain has accepted responsibility for keeping the sea lanes open . " Foudroyant links the past and the present to the future . We who know how much our survival depends on keeping alive naval tradition in the youth of Britain owe it to her , as well as to the nation she has served for so long , to see that she is kept ready and useful for generations yet to come . " An occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice from the Whale Island naval gunnery school , which , in the British tradition , bears the nautical name H.M.S. Excellent . From Foudroyant 's graceful silhouette I swung the telescope past Whale and Horsea Islands to pick up the line of Army forts on the ridge of distant Ports Down , four miles to the north . Part-time Island , Born of Tides Well I remembered the first long summer afternoon I had spent stretched out on 400-foot-high Ports Down , studying the lie of the mighty anchorage . From that ridge I first saw how Portsmouth anchors a three-by-four-mile " parttime island " guarding the island of Britain . As I watched while the day ran out , to the distant accompaniment of sunset guns and crying bugles of the forts , the flat below me changed from island to peninsula . And as the dusk brought ten thousand lights to life , fully half the fifty square miles of " land " within my range of vision disappeared beneath the returning flood . I realized that no cartographer could draw for me a map of the visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gale screen of the Isle of Wight , ten miles away , unless I told him exactly what hour of what day I wanted the map to represent . Port Creek , which connects Portsmouth Harbour on the west with Langstone Harbour on the east to cut Portsea Island off from the mainland , was alternately a drowned moat and then a gutter of mud , where little boats lay tipped on the turn of their bilges like sailors sleeping off shore leave . When the prevailing southwest breeze blew full , the sucking sound of the tide 's tentacles draining every crevice in the foreshore came plainly up the slope . Complex one-to-six-knot currents , set in motion by the tide , run wet fingers round the Isle of Wight and in and out of every bay within the ring of sea and hills . Endlessly changing combinations of wind , wave , and tide make the waters triangulated by the harbors of Portsmouth , Southampton , and Cowes a perfect cradle for seamen . In this strange maze of moon-moved waters a wellworked boat would need little help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted from dock to dock almost anywhere between Wight 's Yarmouth and mainland Portsmouth . in either direction , by the tides alone . A boat could even circumnavigate tilt Wight by leaving Bembridge bar on the firs : inshore flood ( Southampton Water has . : double high tide ) . The flood would carry hewestward past Cowes , down the Solent , righ ? through the Needles funnel . From there the easting tide would bear her along the south side of the island to Bembridge bar again . completing a 60-mile ride on a tidal merrygo-round ( map , page 515 ) . Shakespeare wrote of the " inconstant moon , " and every Elizabethan seaman whose ship awaited the next tide from Spithead knew what he meant . Not all the Admiralty 's complicated tables and charts could match the local lore of the old pilot on whose tug I once steamed up Fareham Lake , deep into the veins of the harbor . The tides were more important to him than his boilers ; the inconstant moon 's cosmic rhythms punched his time clock and paged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . and wys to undertake . With many a tempest hadde his herd been shake . He knew wel alle the havenes . " No current , or bar ? or Dunkirk rescue ! ? could dismay him after such a discipline . Not even carefully planned sabotage , which exploded ammunition barges in Fareham Lake soon after the Korean battles opened , could close the vital fairway to such weathered hearts of oak . Skill Gained Here Applied in War If Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton , how many naval victories have sprung from the tide-battling work boats and racing cutters of Spithead and the Solent ? Consider the case of the British frigate Cardigan Bay , making herself at home in the treacherous waters of Korea . Was Cardigan 's conning officer remembering Portsmouth 's tides when he took his ship by touch and sixth sense so far up the Han estuary and river behind the astonished Communist lines as to suggest cavalry tactics rather than naval ? In July , 1951 , a small launch from the same Cardigan Bay , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. landing ship through tricky sand banks and channels 100 miles behind Red lines to recover parts of a Russian-built MIG-15 shot down offshore . While aircraft from both British and American carriers flew cover , Lieutenant Ross 's watermanship and " Nelson 's touch " contributed to the success of the operation . The Ports Down ridge overlooking the  |p518  phenomenon of the swirling tide is an earthworks honeycombed with underground forts , built , like the sea forts rising from Spithead , about the time of our American Civil War . At mile intervals the tunneled strong rooms lift foreheads up through the chalk under brick-surfaced helmets camouflaged with grass . In these Ports Down forts were the undercover Naval Plotting Room and part of the headquarters " brain " ( known as " the Plot " ) of the Allied invasion to liberate Europe . Here planners worked night and day toward the great climax of June 6 , 1944 ( page 529 ) . On that June morning the spring tide of the free world swept full force across the Channel and up the beaches of Normandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just over the down ridge away from the sea , I saw the sail-sized map of the invasion plan set up for the late Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay , Allied Naval Commander in Chief , Expeditionary Forces . Scene of Eisenhower 's Historic Decision Sitting in the chair General Eisenhower had occupied , I looked up at the clock high on the map . Its hands were frozen at " H " hour . On the map the first Allied spearheads were reaching the beach . A small plaque near by reads : In this room at 2230 on the fourth day of June , Nineteen Hundred and Forty-four , General Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Supreme Allied Commander , made the historic decision to launch the assault against the continent of Europe on the sixth day of June despite uncertain weather conditions . Had this major decision not been made the whole operation would have had to be postponed until the next suitable tidal period a fortnight later . Adverse weather conditions which then arose might well have altered the whole course of the war . In the parish church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff of the British Second Army took chivalric vows : " To relieve the oppressed , to restore freedom .. . and to bring peace . " Their chaplain recited the prayer popularly attributed to Sir Francis Drake before Cadiz in 1587 : " 0 Lord God , when Thou givest to Thy servants to endeavour any great matter , grant us also to know that it is not the beginning , but the continuing of the same until the end , until it be thoroughly finished , which yieldeth the true glory ... " As they knelt on their battle eve , from their massed ships in the harbor flew the cross of St. George , the same cross which had streamed over Knights Templars and Hospitallers on the Third Crusade as they left this very same harbor . Britain 's years of pre-invasion thrust and parry against the Nazi crescent drawn around her was in many ways a geographic duel of naval base against naval base , dockyard against dockyard , in which the Fleet bases were often in the very front lines . In 1941 the German battleship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic , trying to reach the relative safety of a French harbor . Admiralty wireless towers on Horsea Island crackled with " game 's afoot " messages until warships and carrier planes closed in for the kill . To destroy the lock gates of the huge dry dock at St. Nazaire , thus denying its shelter to Bismarck 's sister ship Tirpitz , was the early 1942 objective of an overage ex-United States destroyer , H.M.S. Campbeltown . Originally the U.S.S. Buchanan , she was one of 50 United States destroyers traded for the lease of eight British bases . It was like sailing into the gates of hell . One British lieutenant , watching two of every three of his escorting motor launches blow apart under the German fire , kept repeating to himself , " My God , we 're still alive ! " The dying Campbeltown , set to explode in a few hours like a giant time bomb , rammed her lock-gate target only four minutes off schedule . In one furious sacrifice she altered the whole balance of the Battle of the Atlantic that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarines ? built secretly in the Portsmouth yard ? took the war relentlessly home to Tirpitz , hiding in Norwegian fjords . His Majesty 's Dockyard at Portsmouth fitted out nearly a thousand assault vessels and assembled parts of the artificial harbors used for the Normandy thrust . Battered landing craft and torpedo boat survivors from Normandy , St. Nazaire , Dunkirk , Dieppe , and scores of other Channel battles lie quietly now in the creeks below Ports Down . Some , converted into houseboats , fly kitchen aprons where the battle flags streamed . Still others wait to be cannibalized for scrap . Black Prince Repeated History But Portsmouth 's tides of battle sweep back far beyond World War II . One of the attack vessels assigned to the American task force on D Day , 1944 , was the new 5.25-inch-gun British cruiser H.M.S. Black Prince . Driving close inshore , this 20th-century namesake shelled almost the same French beaches where in 1346 Edward III and his black-armored son landed their fighters who later won at Crecy . For Edward some 1,600 ships had been assembled in Spithead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowmen and men at arms on the Common lying along the sea front between Old Portsmouth and Southsea , the same greensward where 1944 's champions gathered their battle kit by the landing craft . Below the downs and at the edge of one tidal creek is a solid reminder of Portsmouth 's first role in Europe 's history ? a Roman fortress , whose walls enclose a square of nine acres now bounding the ruins of Portchester Castle . Caesar 's imperial galleys , perilously vulnerable to the 15-foot tides pouring over the Channel shelves , found this land-enclosed harbor a heaven-sent refuge . The fortress the Legionaries built here was the westernmost of the chain guarding the " Saxon Shore . " The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle names the year 418 as that in which the Romans " gathered together all the treasure that was in Britain . Hiding part of it underground , they bore away the rest into Gaul . " The Roman tide was receding before a new wave of power ? " long serpent " ships of Saxon sea wolves .

" Alfred 's fleet began Britannia 's rule here in the waters of the Wight in 897 , and maintained it in a pageant of billowing red , purple , and gold " cloak of the wind " square sails of double velvet .  |p530  In 1066 Harold , last of the Saxon kings , made the mistake no English ruler has dared to repeat . His ships of war gathered near the Wight to repel the threatened invasion by William of Normandy ; but as the summer passed , Harold failed to keep his fleet in being . " Result : England fell for the last time to a foreign invader .

The view of Portsmouth Harbour from its lead-sheathed roof is almost the equal of the panoramic crow's-nest view from higher Ports Down . Crusader Richard the Lionheart sailed up this very harbor in 1189 to proclaim himself King of England . Twenty-three years later Richard 's brother , the John of Magna Carta , enclosed with walls the beach " docks " of Portsmouth village , where mud and wattle dams , hastily raised at dead low water around grounded vessels , allowed hull repairs to be made in the " dry . " As the size and draught of the King 's ships continued to increase , and the upper harbor silted up , the center of gravity of Britain 's naval strength gradually moved from Portchester Castle at the inner end of the harbor to the deeper water and dry docks of the growing village at the harbor mouth .  |p531  During the long Napoleonic Wars the Castle Keep and the hulks in the harbor held up to 12,000 prisoners . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxtail soup and to carve what are now almost priceless ship models from the bones . Bombs Destroy Many Landmarks Seeing the rest of " Pompey " today is complicated by the damage done to many of the prewar landmarks . Like Malta , this strategic city was hammered hard by Nazi air raiders . Decoy fires were lit on near-by Hayling Island to confuse their aim , but it was difficult to conceal a target area so well known . The principal business and shopping centers for a population of 230,000 were obliterated , the Guildhall gutted ( page 516 ) , nearly every house damaged . In four years of Nazi raids nearly a thousand civilians lost their lives . The best way to see what is left ( provided you have looked the ground over from Ports Down beforehand ) is to walk along the sea wall from Southsea , following the crescent of the beach westward past the harbor mouth to Portsmouth Point , then around the commercial harbor to the Royal Dockyard . First landmark west of Eastney 's Royal Marine Barracks and Cumberland Fort along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1539 and still heavily fortified . The Tudor Henrys , VII and VIII , made Portsmouth a blockhouse commanding the English Channel water gap through which expanding nation-states of Europe glimpsed new frontiers across the seas . The Portsmouth base could easily dominate the Channel , since sailing ships preferred to hug the safer English coast . Onward from Southsea Castle , naval memorials bedeck the beach promenade . Victory 's stream anchor at Trafalgar lies here to mark where Nelson 's rowing barge took him from English soil for the last time , out to his waiting " band of brothers " in Spithead . At the end of the promenade are remnants of the sea ramparts and moat defending Old Portsmouth , including the Sally Port , the Square Tower built in 1494 , and the Round Tower , dating from 1417 . Here at the harbor bottleneck , Henry VIII stretched a " mightye chaine of yron " across to Blockhouse Fort to protect his hundred sail .

Cross Recalls Fate of Mary . Rose On High Street , up which Charles I 's bust stares from a niche in the sea wall , stood circumnavigator Lord Anson 's house , now also destroyed . The area of destruction extends right up to the Portsmouth Cathedral , St. Thomas 's , where a piece of timber dredged from the Spithead wreck of Henry VIII 's Mary Rose forms an altar cross .

Wrapping a sheltering arm around the tiny Camber , the commercial anchorage within the Navy 's harbor , is Portsmouth Point ( page 517 ) . On the Point , in the 18th century , forty public houses in as many rods supplied sea-weary sailors with " fleet 's in " amenities . The Wyllies ' Tower House is on the site of what was once the Shyppe Tyger Inn . The old Star and Garter Hotel here , where many of the great three-decker admirals stayed and fugitives hid from the Navy 's press gangs in a secret room , now stands derelict . But " the Point " retains its salty flavor in the busy boatyards and the bombed sites strewn with marine gear . Within the Dockyard itself and lying to starboard of Victory , a figurehead-decked museum displays the late W. L. Wyllie 's " Panorama of Trafalgar , " a magnificent canvas of the sailing Navy 's culminating battle as seen through the stern fanlights of the French 80-gun Neptune ( page 543 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sculptor , and engraver , told me how his father had studied the eye-witness accounts of the battle , and details of the ships taking part in it , for forty years before he started work on the vast spread of the canvas .

Fortunate to be on the far wing of the French and Spanish line as Collingwood and Nelson crashed into it , she escaped ; but within another fortnight a pursuing British squadron came up with her . Technically , she never surrendered ; her colors were struck for her by British shot before the surrender order , given by the last surviving officer on deck , could be carried out . Taken into His Majesty 's fleet and fitly renamed Implacable , she fought with distinction against the Russians in the Baltic in 1808 , and in 1840 took part in a blockade of the Syrian coast to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped save her from the shipbreakers in 1908 . Between World Wars Implacable served as a holiday training ship for boys and girls , under Colonel Wyllie 's command . At the start of World War II she came back on the Admiralty 's active list as a floating storehouse . Colonel Wyllie , who had been a Royal Flying Corps pilot in World War I , rejoined Implacable 's complement with a Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve commission to teach seamanship to wartime recruits . He greeted each new ship 's company with the announcement that they would live under rules for perfection first drawn up by a young frigate captain who served under Nelson . A Grand Old Ship Goes Home The unavoidable neglect of six years of war accomplished what no enemy , not even Victory , had been able to do . When I saw her last , with her buff and scarlet color bands in gaudy relief against the North Sea blue of the restless steel veterans moored near her , Implacable was still being useful as a training ship for Sea Cadets . But the rot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ship 's legion of friends could not save her at the last . On December 2 , 1949 , flying the British and French standards side by side , Implacable was towed out through the harbor mouth to sea and to the immortality of being ceremonially blown apart . Through the long night the Channel tides carried the flotsam southward ; and so eventually she returned home to the French beaches where she had been laid down long ago in 1797 . Portsmouth 's virtually landlocked harbor and its sheltered roadstead outside , large enough to anchor a large part of the world 's navies safely at all seasons and all tides , were obviously enough to mark it from almost the  |p534  beginning as the premier naval port of the Empire . But draw a ring around Portsmouth 15 miles in radius , and the geographic reasons for its role in Britannia 's naval history become even more understandable . A centuries-old smugglers ' paradise lies eastward in Langstone and Chichester Harbours , and a sportsman 's heaven in Cowes an equal distance to the west . In their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Admiralty well as naval architects and as trainers of seamen . Some of the best-known shipbuilding firms of Portsmouth , Gosport , the Solent , and Southampton Water descend from craftsmen who would build for the highest bidder , whether pirate lugger or King 's revenue cutter . They taught each other designing for speed , as French privateer hare and English sea hound had taught each other earlier . As for the sportsmen , the Admiralty watched the outcome of important races sailed in the Solent or Spithead , many of the Portsmouth officer members of the Royal Yacht Squadron serving as crews . After the schooner yacht America , representing a syndicate of the New York Yacht Club , outsped all British yachts around the Wight in the Exhibition summer of 1851 , a British admiral hauled her out in a Portsmouth dock to study her lines . One Gosport-Cowes builder still carries in his files today the lines of the stout launch his firm built for H.M.S. Bounty before she sailed from Spithead with Capt . William " Breadfruit " Bligh . This builder will also tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Royal Yacht Squadron 's Earl of Belfast . Belfast 's favorite sport with the armed Waterwitch was to wait for the Navy 's fast dispatch brigs to get under way from Spithead , Bermuda bound , and then sail circles round them . In 1834 the admiring Admiralty purchased Waterwitch and put her to chasing the fast Baltimore-built slaving schooners off west Africa in those days when the pursuing white ensign was the Negro slave 's flag of freedom . Still later , young British officers on leave from Portsmouth studied speed as volunteers in ships which ran contraband past the  |p543  Federal blockade between Bermuda , the Bahamas , and Confederate ports . From such **28;664;TOOLONG antecedents , Portsmouth still draws zest . Sailboats are carried as standard equipment on almost all British naval vessels . While naval men take a sailor 's afternoon off racing in Spithead or the harbor , telescopes may level across them to the famous Gosport yard and sail loft where some of the America 's Cup challengers were designed , built , and rigged . Where Ships Found Hearts of Oak On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final clue to her geographic predestination . Abutting on the Solent and reaching inland between Southampton Water and the Avon River is the New Forest . Here many ships of the " wooden walls " around England found their ribs and hearts of oak . An average of 3,500 full-sized oaks , felled and then seasoned in the timber ponds , went into each stout hull . After the launching at Buckler 's Hard , a score of husky sailors at long sweeps would work the hull down Beaulieu River and across Spithead on the conveyor belt of the tide to the Portsmouth rigging towers and ropewalks . Commissioned there , the ships were blessed by the chaplain of the Fleet with the traditional prayer : " . . . that we may ever be a terror to all that is evil and bitter . " Three miles from Buckler 's Hard is Sowley Pond . Here , in the 18th century , ironstone broken from Hengistbury Head and the Hordle Cliffs was worked in blast furnaces heated with charcoal from the New Forest , and shaped by a water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships . With a forge and rolling mill near by in the upper tide-creek veins of Portsmouth Harbour , Henry Cort , to break Russia 's grip on the iron trade , developed in 1784 the puddling process which helped to make British ironmasters second to none . The strength grown into the native oak and the spirit tempered in the iron torn from Channel headlands were the breed and the blood enduring in the great ships . In the year of Waterloo , the astonishing sight of the first steam vessel puffing into Portsmouth Harbour broke up a court-martial sitting in the Gladiator . But the tradition of sail and oak died hard . In the Crimean War against Russia , the Admiralty used paddle steamers simply as tugs to tow the big wooden three-deckers into position for shelling the batteries ashore . But in 1862 The Times of London yielded to the inevitable in a dispatch describing the world 's first action between ironclads , the battle between the Federal Monitor and the Confederate Merrimac in far-off Hampton Roads , Virginia : " Whereas we had available for immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two , these two being the Warrior and her sister ironside Black Prince . There is not now a ship in the English navy , apart from these two , that it would not be madness to trust in engagement with that little Monitor . " A new dreadnought age of armor and machinery had come . One of the best vantage points for a farewell view of Portsmouth is the Sally Port , cut through the sea ramparts by the Square Tower and by the tide running strongly past the harbor entrance . Here " naval heroes innumerable have embarked to fight their country 's battles " ( page 541 ) . In the Spit roadstead where rebellious seamen were flogged through the drumming fleet or keelhauled from yardarm to yardarm , Peter the Great of Russia , enchanted by the spectacle of a sham battle in 1698 , exclaimed that the life of an English admiral was more to be envied than that of a Tsar of Muscovy . The young Queen Victoria , thrilled with her first naval review in 1842 , exulted : " I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that I am indeed surrounded by those who will uphold that title in the battle and the breeze . " Her great-great-grandchild Elizabeth , now Queen , has as consort a handsome sailor prince . Submarines Lent the Land Their Power I stood on the Sally Port one afternoon in Britain 's grim winter of 1946-47 . The nation 's reserves of fuel and energy had been exhausted by the gales of war . From the sea , one by one , submarines slipped silently by me . They were headed for the Dockyard to lend the power of their Diesel-driven generators to the machines which , lacking coal , would otherwise have stopped . While I watched the day fade through the snow squalls , back against the hills of Wight , the giant swift shadow of the twin-funneled R.M.S. Queen Elizabeth smoked in from the sea .
