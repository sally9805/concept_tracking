txt Barring complications , President Eisenhower should be well enough within the next two weeks to resume some personal control of the nation 's affairs , a noted heart specialist said yesterday . Dr. Paul Dudley White of Boston , the specialist , examined the President yesterday morning . He told General Eisenhower that his chances for complete recovery were " reasonably good . " He cautioned , however , that the two-week period following an attack of coronary thrombosis , such as President Eisenhower suffered Saturday morning , was a critical one in which complicating setbacks might occur . If no setback developed in this period , he said , the President should be able , for example , to confer briefly with John Foster Dillies , Secretary of State , and read official documents . Progress Is Satisfactory . Dr. White found the President in satisfactory condition in the morning and said his morale was " wonderful . " His optimistic analysis was echoed in the 4 P. M. ( 7 P. M. New York time ) medical bulletin . That reported General Eisenhower had spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch of Meat , vegetables , fresh fruit cocktail and milk . ? - Just after 9 P. M. , the attending physicians reported : " This has been a comfortable day for the President . His satisfactory progress as previously reported has continued throughout the day . " Up to 2 A. K ( 5 A. K New York time ) there had been no further announcements from the hospital . Although the President still was confined to bed with no possibility of rising for the next twelve days , the oxygen tent was removed during the morning physical examination , at lunchtime , and again when he ate his dinner . In all , he spent about ninety minutes outside the tent , which had been installed to ease his breathing and reduce the strain on the overburdened heart , Mrs. Eisenhower and the President 's son , Maj. John S. Eisenhower , quartered across the hall from General Eisenhower 's room , visited with him during the day . Major Eisenhower was " in and out " for several brief visits . , Mrs. Eisenhower sat through lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the evening meal . Has Vegetable Dinner The President had dinner about 6:30 P. M. , and was asleep less than two hours later . His dinner , eaten with the oxygen tent temporarily removed , consisted of . consomm ? , ' a vegetable plate including spinach , beets and broiled tomato , and sliced peaches . There was noticeable relaxation today in the tension that had pervaded the Denver White House for the first forty-eight hours of General Eisenhower 's illness . Major Eisenhower , wearing civilian clothes , came to the afternoon press conference and sat composed with James C. Hagerty , White House press secretary . Mr. Hagerty said the major had come because he had always wanted to see how a news conference was conducted . Shortly after leaving the President , Dr. White volunteered the information that a short talk with Mr. Dulles should be possible at the end of General Eisenhower 's second week in the hospital , This suggested that the dent himself might have ralczd the question whether he co : ' d physically rzassort his atiZhly : 7 in foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreIgn ministers in late October . Dr. White 's estimate of tin ' probable future for General El- senhower was optimistic , al-I though he hedged questions ) about the President 's physical I capacity for enduring a second term . IHe said he had seen many , patients with the same disease who had recovered and resumed their normal activities . Asked whether he ever had seen a patient resume a job with physical demands comparable to the Presidency , Dr. White replied that he never had treated another President for heart disease . If recovery is normal , he said , General Eisenhower could resume light activity in the third week of his illness . He probably could leave the hospital after the third week and , during the , second month , begin rehabilitation to normal living ? " getting out and around , " the doctor added . The morning medical bulletin Ion the President 's progress said that his condition continued " satisfactory without complications .

It consisted of prunes , oatmeal , a soft boiled egg , toast and milk . The President 's morale was high , Dr. White said . " He 's a wonderful patient , " the doctor said . " I believe he feels well enough to get up and go to the golf links today . He did n't say so , but I 'm sure he 'd like to , " Dr. White told a news conference . May Remain a Month The doctor said he had assured the President that his chances for complete recovery were " reasonably good . " If recovery proceeds without complications , Dr. White said , General Eisenhower could be returned to Washington or to his Gettysburg farm for convalescence after his third week at Fitzsimons Army Hospital here . After a whispered consultation with Mr. Hagerty at the news conference , however , the doctor added that it might be advisable to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain there for a month . A cardiogram taken yesterday morning showed that the President was progressing in normally satisfactory fashion for patients recovering from coronary thrombosis without complications , Dr. White said . The President 's attack , he added , had damaged a portion of front wall of the heart , an area commonly affected by such attacks . During this week and next , the , doctor said , the body would be clearing the dead tissue from the affected area and replacing it with scar tissue , which would take about three weeks to toughen sufficiently to allow the President to step up his activity . Dr. White , who had arrived here Sunday and visited the ) President Sunday night , flew back to Boston yesterday . He said he would be in telephone contact twice daily with the other doctors attending General Eisenhower at Fitzsimons . He was returning to Boston , he said , " partly because the President 's condition is so satisfactory , and partly because he has such excellent attention here , medically and otherwise . " Before leaving , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presidential offices at Lowery Air Force Base . Seated at a table between Mr. Hagerty and Maj. Gen. Howard McC . Snyder , ' the President 's personal physician , Dr. White talked rapidly and freely . He seemed as relaxed as a professor addressing a roomful of freshman medical students and he punctuated what amounted almost to a moniogue with occasional flashes of wit . He began with an academic discussion of coronary thrombosis , its characteristics , its results and its causes . It was , he said , " about the commonest important , illness that besets a. middle-aged man in this country today . " The disease , he explained , begins " insidiously in the coronary arterial wall " ? on the inner walls of the blood vessels that feed blood to the heart muscle . Primarily , he said , it was an arterial disease rather than a heart ailment , although it affected the heart secondarily . Walls of Arteries Thicken The walls of the arteries thicken , he explained , narrowing the passage through which the blood travels . When a blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it blocks off the flow of blood to the area of the heart fed by the blocked vessel . The formation of the clot , or thrombus , is called thrombosis . The thickening of the coronary arteries , which hold the clot , Dr. White said , may occur years before the thrombosis . Many persons , he said , have the thickening of the artery walls but are never stricken by thrombosis . In many cases , he added , it is impossible to diagnose the thickening of the coronary arteries before an attack . This was the case with the President . On Aug. 1 , a thorough heart check-up failed to detect any hint of the arterial disease . There were many factors causing the disease , Dr. White said . It was medically identified only forty years ago and many of the suspected causes still were in dispute . He said that age , sex , heredity , activity , occupation , stress and strain , diet , alcohol and tobacco all were factors that might produce it . It was most common in middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " the average age is about 50 in this condition . So you might say that the Presideent , at 65 , is fifteen years ahead of the game from the standpoint of that type of illness . " The President will be 65 Oct. 14 . Dr. White said he doubted that the President 's attack had been caused by the twenty-seven holes of golf played Friday tor by the relatively thin air of Denver , which is 5,000 feet above sea level . Dr. White said he did not believe the disease was caused by exercise . Exercise , he said , was more likely in his estimation to delay its onset . When thrombosis occurred , Dr. White said , some of the tissue died in the part of heart deprived I of its blood supply . Body cells during the first week of the attack carried away this dead tissue and new scar tissue began to form , he said . During this phase , the white blood cells increased at the point of the thrombus and fever occurred , he said . Increased white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . This , he explained , accounted for the President 's slight fever Sunday night and for a " slight to moderate rise " in his blond count noted yesterday morning . During the second week , he continued , new building cells set the scar . During the third week the scar would toughen and during this period the President , could only rest quietly in a bed or chair . Dr. White said he was describing the average case . " And I would say that the President has had an average attack , " he added . Explanation of Bulletin Dr. White then gave an explanation of Monday 's medical bulletin , which stated : " The President 's condition continues to be satisfactory without complications . He had a good bowel movement . He enjoyed a breakfast of prunes , oatmeal , soft-boiled egg , toast and milk . The President had a slight fever late yesterday afternoon , as is usualln such cases , but his temperature is normal this morning . The oxygen tent will be omitted at intervals today . The electrocardiagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart wall infarct . " An " infarct , " according to the dictionary , is a portion of tissue congested because of an embolus , such as a blood clot . Dr. White said that there were many complications that might arise if the President had been " very , very ill . " " They can still come , " he said . " You want to bear in mind that during this period in which the heart muscle is in a delicate state , we can still have complications . For the first two weeks we keep our fingers crossed . " " The President 's slight fever , " he added , was " just exactly according to Hoyle " in the pattern of recovery . At 5 P. M. Sunday the rectal temperature had been 101.4 degrees , which is equiyalent to an oral temperature of 100.4 degrees , he said . Yesterday morning the rectal temperature was 99.6 degrees , or the maximum normal reading . The oxygen tent was being removed , he said , because the President had been examined outside it yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been explained earlier that the use of the oxygen tent was purely routine in such cases . Dr. White and the President discussed , among other things , golf . It was " quite possible , " the doctor told him , that he could resume his golf after recovery . Nor was there any reason , the doctor said , why the President should not be able to fly in the future . The President was being given medication to keep the blood from clotting again . After the attack Saturday morning General Snyder gave him a morphine injection to relieve the pain , it was reported yesterday . Sunday night he was given " a little seconal " to help him sleep , Dr. White said . William E. Robinson , president of the Coca Cola Company and a close personal friend of the Eisenhowers , went to the hospital , visited with Mrs. Eisenhower and lunched with her son , but did not see the President .
