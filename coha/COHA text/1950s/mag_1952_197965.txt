A news photographer has the job of recording events , often tragic ones . Does this excuse him if he takes a picture rather than trying to prevent a tragedy from happening ? This journalistic question arose last week in San Francisco . On the high ( 220-ft . ) Golden Gate Bridge stood Ned Wells , 26 , a commercial photographer who makes his living taking pictures of incoming ships from the bridge for a studio that peddles prints to crews and passengers . Fifteen hundred feet away , Wells saw a woman climb over the rail of the bridge and stand hesitantly on a girder . She was Mrs. E. Noel Durant , 61 , a retired banker 's wife who had been brooding over her health . <P> Wells , camera at the ready , began running toward her , but a passing motorist , Cyrus A. Samuel , beat him to the scene . " Do n't jump ! " cried Samuel . Replied Mrs. Durant : " Nobody can do anything . I 'm very ill . " But as Samuel kept pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew noticeably more nervous as she caught sight of Wells , aiming his aerial camera with its long-distance lens . " Is he going to take my picture ? " she cried . Samuel reassured her : " He 's an engineer , holding a measuring box . " But Wells continued snapping his shutter , and Samuel said they could hear it . " He 's taking my picture ! " cried the woman , and jumped to her death. * <P> Photographer Wells , who later insisted that he was too far away for his presence to make any difference , raced to the studio and put in calls to newspaper city desks . Hearst 's afternoon Call-Bulletin bought one of the pictures for $85 ; Scripps-Howard 's News got another for $25 . Both papers ran them on Page One , and next morning Hearst 's Examiner ran others . The only San Francisco paper that did not run the pictures was the Chronicle , whose deskman could not be reached when the agency was peddling the prints . Next day the Chronicle ran a story that plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor Larry Fanning : " We would n't have printed the pictures if they 'd been offered to us for nothing . . . There might have been one chance in 100 of preventing the suicide if Wells had stayed away . Instead , he may have been the last straw . " <P> <P> * In a similar case recently ( TIME , March 10 ) , police warned New York Mirror Photographer Bob Wendlinger that he would be arrested if he took flashlight pictures of a man hanging by his hands from Manhattan 's George Washington Bridge . Just after the man let go , the photographer got his picture .
