IN OFFICES , shops , clubs and locker rooms this summer you 'll see men pointing to the creases in their trousers , peeling off their jackets to display their shirts , and lifting their cuffs to show off the sterling merits of their socks . This will not mean that the American male has suddenly gone foppish ? he will be talking about the sensational new synthetic materials which are rapidly revolutionizing men 's wardrobes . Super fabrics from oil , coal and natural gas will soon clothe a man from the skin out better than he has ever been dressed before . In the last few years , hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent by chemical firms and clothing manufacturers to bring forth the new man-made textiles and now the finished products are beginning to trickle through to the retail stores . Some of the coveted garments are in short supply , awaiting the completion of big new plants , but before long you 'll see the results everywhere . Suits You Can Swim in You 'll see crowds of men at baseball games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had stepped out of a bandbox . Wrinkled and baggy clothes will be gone forever . Garments will not shrink . and moths will starve to death . Spots will come out like magic . Tailor bills and laundry bills will be cut in half , and housewives will have less work to do . Cumbersome baggage will be a thing of the past , and businessmen carrying only briefcases will return from three-week trips looking as fresh as when they left home . Half a dozen new fabrics and treatments have combined to launch this sartorial millennium . The newest and most spectacular fabric is Dacron . When Dr. Wallace Carothers of du Pont discovered nylon in the early ' 30s , he also laid the chemical foundation for the promising filament now called Dacron . Nylon got the green light , and proceeded to take over the market of the silkworm . Since then , English chemists have made cloth from Carothers ' " sleeper , " and at the close of the war , du Pont took it off the shelf and got busy . Chemists were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They predicted that it could be made into a sturdy , long-wearing cloth that would keep its shape better than any known material . Such a cloth would resist wrinkling and , if wrinkled , would quickly recover . They turned out enough Dacron in the laboratory to make a few suits . Two years ago a few score of salesmen and executives began giving the suits rough usage on the road . One man wore his powder blue , summer-weight Dacron suit 57  | days without a press , riding in trains , planes and automobiles . For good measure , he jumped into two swimming pools fully clad . Then they took the suit and put it on a dummy in a swank exhibition room . It still looked presentable enough to wear anywhere . Dacron suits , like others , will wrinkle a little the first day of wear , but most of the wrinkles come out at night . While most suits , if worn continuously without pressing , keep on losing their shape until they look like sacks draped over hydrants , Dacron day after day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time came for a sneak preview , and in 1950 material for 200 suits was sent to Witty Brothers , New York tailors . They made them up and put a one-day ad in the Times . As a consumer test it was a failure , for word had leaked out , and within 24 hours the suits were grabbed up by competitors ' comparison shoppers and by Wall Street prospectors who were watching du Pont stock . New Colors , More Patterns Last year , Witty Brothers , who have sole rights for the 100-percent Dacron fabric for men 's suits and slacks , sold 2,000 summerweight suits for $90 each . This year they got enough material for 7,500 suits and 7,500 pairs of slacks , which are on sale in large cities throughout the country . Last year 's Dacron suits were either solid light blue or brown because problems of dyeing the new fabric had not been completely solved . Now the suits , slightly less expensive , appear in many shades , as well as in stripes , plaids and crash weaves . Also on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue evening clothes which look like their woolen counterparts and keep a press indefinitely . The new fabric will riot be plentiful until du Pont 's new $33,000,000 Dacron plant . now being built in Kingston , N.C. , goes into production . in mid-1953 . Stains and Moths Get Nowhere There are few limits to Dacron 's versatility . Witty Brothers ' vice-president Spencer Witty took a pair of light tan slacks out of stock and emptied his fountain pen on one leg . The material sucked up the ink like blotting paper . Then he took the slacks to the washroom and rinsed them out in cold water with no soap , wringing them dry by hand . When he shook them out , the ink splotch was gone , the creases were sharp and the legs hung as flat as twin envelopes . Three hours later they were dry and immaculate . But he does n't endorse the trick as standard procedure : some inks might not come out . Egg and catchup stains and all manner of water-soluble messes can be quickly and completely removed from Dacron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be removed by an appropriate solvent such as your cleaner uses . Long wear is another Dacron advantage . These summer suits have been worn 200 to 300 days without looking shabby . When a suit is not worn continuously , a man seldom counts the number of days it lasts , but it is safe to say that few woolen tropicals will go more than 100 days without showing signs of wear . The makers believe that Dacron should wear at least twice as long as wool . All suits sold so far have been of eightounces-to-the-yard material , which is a light summer fabric , but a few full-weight suits suitable for winter have been made and have proved satisfactory . Scientific experts differ concerning the  | comparative warmth of wool and Dacron , but men who have worn the new suits in cold weather say they are comfortable . When the new fabric is plentiful , Dacron suits , slacks and topcoats will be made in all weights , colors and patterns . Dacron is highly resistant to shrinking . Wear a suit long enough and it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is highly moth-resistant , for it contains no nourishment for the insects . No fabric is perfect , and a few warnings go with Dacron . If you are careless with a pipe or cigarette , you can burn a hole in a Dacron suit faster than in wool . It is a thermoplastic material , which means that it will melt if heated enough ? a too-hot iron will ruin Dacron the way it does nylon . But Dacron will not flare and is by no means a fire menace . It can be thrown in a tub with impunity , but so far , because of the limited supply , linings and shoulder pads are made of other materials which might not dry out as evenly if soaked too long . To he perfectly safe one should send such suits to the cleaners . Washable slacks with all " findings " of Dacron are now available , and it is expected that in another year there will be enough of the new fabric to line the jackets . Making a Suit Static-Free Static electricity sometimes makes synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather is dry and cold . A Denver man returned a Dacron suit for this reason . Now a number of firms have worked out chemical antistatic treatments , and the problem seems licked . Another way of beating static is to blend Dacron with a little - wool or rayon . This does not alter seriously the virtues of the new fabric . Dacron shirts , which are much more plentiful than the suits , are causing a sensation wherever men travel . Many men leave on long trips with one extra Dacron shirt when once they packed a dozen cotton ones . At night they wash out a shirt in the bathroom basin and drape it on a hanger ; in the morning it is dry and as smooth as new . It has been selling for about $11.00 . One purchaser , whose laundry charged him 30 cents a shirt , figured out that after 36 days the Dacron shirt was " his . " Nylon shirts are also fast-drying and easy to wash , but the collars sometimes look crumpled unless they are ironed . Taken all together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the traveler . The new acrylic synthetic fabrics , chemically different from Dacron , will do many things Dacron will do and have some remarkable special virtues of their own . Among them are du Pont 's Orlon and Union Carbide &; Carbon 's Dynel , already on the market , and Chemstrand , Inc. ' s Acrilan , which is soon to go into production . Men 's Orlon shirts , which have been sold for a year or so , are easy to wash , quickdrying , wrinkle-resistant and , like Dacron shirts , popular with travelers who wish to cut down baggage weight . Attractive summer suits of Orlon blended with wool , which have good wrinkle resistance and compete in price with natural fabrics , are on the market . One man wore a sharkskin-type Orlonwool-blend suit for 5:3 days without a press . During that time a waiter spilled a glass of milk on it , and he swabbed it off with a napkin . At the end of the ordeal the suit looked unstained and presentable . Summer suits of 100-percent Orlon are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire range of men 's suitings from summer-weight  | tropical worsteds to heavy winter tweeds . The acrylic fibers differ somewhat in chemical composition , but all have what is known as " bulking power . " This means that they can be made into warm , woolly , highnap fabrics which will outwear wool and are 20 to 30 percent lighter in weight . From these chemical fibers , country tweeds can be made , in all patterns and weights , that are practically indistinguishable from the product of the sheep . Wool-like socks , sweaters , plaid " lumberjack " shirts , ski suits , long winter underwear , and other outdoor sport or work garments with the same merits can be made . Used in Homes , Too Not all these garments will be ready next year or the year after , for substantial production of the synthetic fibers is just getting underway , and there is a big demand for them for industrial and home-decoration purposes as well as for clothing . With quantity production , prices should easily compete with natural wool , and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold spells , droughts , animal diseases and other factors which cause wide fluctuation in wool prices . Consumers are reaping indirect benefits from the new man-made fabrics as their popularity spurs the fabricators of natural materials to improve their products . Leading firms are spending millions on various chemical clipping processes , which at a cost , make cotton or wool cloth water-repellent , fire-retardant , wrinkle-resistant , mothproof , shrink-resistant , mildew-resistant and virtually immune from stain or sunrot . Treated Wool Wo n't Shrink If you take a pair of woolen socks and treat one of them with the Monsanto Chemical Co. ' s melamine-resin process ( called Resloom ) , then wash the pair and let them dry naturally , the treated sock remains the same length while the untreated one may shrink as much as two inches . This process is now being widely used to control wool shrinkage , and American Cyanamid and U.S. Rubber have developed similar methods . The man who wears the clothes will choose among the competing new fabrics and processes ; however his vote goes , he will be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
