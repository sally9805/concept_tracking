Dear TIME-Reader : <P> A HANDSOME Westchester matron , chic in a Hattie Carnegie dress and fragrant with Patou 's Moment Suprme , passed TIME Editor James C. Keogh in New York 's Grand Central Terminal , humming : " Da-vy , Davy Crockett , King of the wild frontier ! " In Beverly Hills , startled Furrier Al Teitelbaum told TIME Correspondent Ezra Goodman that a movie matron had handed him a mink stole and ordered it cut into " coonskin " caps for her two sons . <P> Other young Davy Crocketts in coonier coonskins around the U.S. have set off a resonant boom and what looks like the beginning of a free-for-all trademark squabble ( see BUSINESS ' The Wild Frontier ) ONE sunny day last week a helicopter landed on the heliport atop the Sankei Kaikan , the daily newspaper Sangyo Keizai 's building . Out stepped Edgar R. Baker , managing director of TIME 'S international editions . Quickly , pretty Takarazuka girls presented him with a bouquet as thanks for TIME 'S story about Takarazuka ( in Music , Jan. 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Baker 's arrival was timed for the formal opening of our new offices in the Sankei Kaikan . These quarters are in sharp contrast to our first home in bombed-out postwar Tokyo . Hard on the heels of General MacArthur , TIME moved into the Japanese capital , set up shop in backrooms above the Kyo-bunkwan bookstore and published its pony-size , adless Far Eastern edition . Last week some 400 Japanese and foreigners came to see our new quarters , and to sip , among other drinks , such an inscrutable concoction as the " Monkey Gland " ( gin , orange juice , D.O.M . and grenadine ) . <P> During his visit , Managing Director Baker announced that TIME is ready to help organize a 1956 Asian investment conference along the lines of the highly successful inter-American meetings we co-sponsored in New Orleans early this year . <P> FOR this week 's cover story on Prime Minister Anthony Eden and the British general election campaign , half a dozen TIME correspondents took to the hustings in pursuit of Tory , Labor and Liberal candidates of all ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the London bureau 's Robert Lubar wondered how the Laborite rebel would like being shadowed by a U.S. newsman . As it turned out , Bevan liked it fine . He began by taking Lubar to task for what he said was TIME 'S rough treatment of him . " But you thrive on it , " Lubar remarked . Bevan snorted and replied : " If you administer strychnine to a man over a number of years , the fact that he survives is no credit to you . You do n't call it humanitarian ! " <P> With that , Bevan guffawed and took Lubar into his official party . When asked what he would talk about at a rally one night , Bevan nodded toward Lubar and rumbled : " Ask him . " <P> Cordially yours ,
