Big , bald Louis Johnson was genial , relaxed and spruce in a brown summer suit and white shoes . The Senators , in the seventh week of the MacArthur hearing , obviously cottoned to ex-Secretary of Defense Johnson . Inquisitors and witness amiably exchanged anecdotes , often dropped into informal use of first names . Johnson ducked questions with easy bluffness that politicians understand . " Do you still beat your wife ? " he countered to one loaded question . At times , he talked about himself in the third person with the air of a man watching himself from the wings of history , a faint , fond smile on his lips . <P> Day In &; Day Out . Johnson declared firmly , " I shall not indulge in personalities , " and he did n't . " I am trying to be a good boy , " he said . But he left no doubt that the two top men in Harry Truman 's Cabinet-he and Dean Acheson-had differed sharply . Military policy , said Johnson , was " being influenced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Their chief differences were over Formosa . " The Defense Department battled day in &; day out to keep Formosa out of hostile hands . " <P> Johnson had noted in Foggy Bottom " a seeming hostility " to Chiang 's government . On military aid programs , " without being able to give you details , the definite feeling I had , there was a dragging of feet , an effort to delay . . . <P> " Generally speaking , it seemed to me that the State Department was critical of and did not support the government we recognized . Personally , I was extremely fearful that we were going to recognize Communist China in the indirect way of permitting it to become a member of the United Nations . " <P> <P> Johnson seized the opportunity to justify his own record , and to reproach the Administration . Going into one session , with two Republican Senators , he said : " Ask me why I was fired . " Someone did . Said Johnson : " My answer is truthfully , under oath , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Nights of Decision . In passing , Johnson gave the Senators a fascinating glimpse into the tense meetings where the decision was made to send U.S. forces to meet the Korean invaders . On a Sunday night , after the first shock of the invasion , the nation 's highest officials met at dinner in Blair House . " I felt that Formosa entered into our security more than Korea . . . General MacArthur had prepared a memorandum on Formosa which I thought was brilliant and I asked General Bradley to read that memorandum . . . During dessert , maybe before the dessert plates were taken out , the Secretary of State again brought up the Korean question ... I interrupted to say that before we got into that too deeply I wanted to discuss Formosa further . The only really violent discussion Secretary Acheson and myself ever had took place for a moment . <P> " When the President took over the meeting , Secretary Acheson stated the picture , as he saw it , on Korea . The President then turned to me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening was taken in the individual , unrehearsed , and unprepared and uncoordinated statements of the several Chiefs and Secretaries ... I was rather proud of them that night . "
