When a composition by Roger Sessions is played , it is a major event . Reason : his music is so imposing and complex that few orchestras dare to try it . But this season . Composer Sessions , 59 , unveils four major new works in a row : 1 ) a cantata ; 2 ) a Mass , to be performed at Kent School , Conn. ; 3 ) a piano concerto , to be played at Manhattan 's Juilliard School of Music next month ; 4 ) a symphony , his third , which the Boston Symphony Orchestra expects to play in March . The Louisville Orchestra , under Robert Whitney , premiered the cantata-really a solo aria the size of a full-grown concerto . Titled Idyll of Theocritus , it was even more imposing than previous jam Sessions . <P> The text is the second Idyll , one of literature 's great love poems , by 3rd century B.C. Greek Poet Theocritus . The piece divides into four moods , as the forsaken girl Simaitha gathers magic spells , then tells the moon goddess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how she became his mistress , and finally explains his desertion and her determination to win him back . Sessions scarcely lets the soprano come up for air . At Louisville , Oklahoma-born Singer Audrey Nossaman needed all her excellent technique-and her strength - for some 40 minutes of music . <P> The solo part inflects the words so poignantly as to enhance their individual meanings , spinning a melodic line of horizon-to-horizon dimensions . The vocal line almost never goes where ears accustomed to traditional melody expect it to go . But the effect is not selfconscious ; before the work is over , the melody attains a sort of naturalness of its own . <P> Louisville critics , softened up by two years of modern music acquired under a $400,000 Rockefeller Foundation grant , were deeply impressed . " History may record , " said the Louisville Times , " that a masterpiece was unveiled . "
