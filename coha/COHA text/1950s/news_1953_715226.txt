txt MIAMI BEACH , Feb. 2 ? Acting to stamp out racketeering in its ranks , the American Federation of Labor made two sharp breaks today with its tradition of noninterference in the internal affairs of its affiliated unions . Its executive council set up a committee of three federation vice presidents to consider means of cleaning up the gang-infested International Longshoremen 's Association . The committee began its work at once and it was indicated that it would submit its report to the council within forty-eight hours . ? District Attorney Frank S. Hogan announced in New York Monday night that he had issued a grand jury subpoena for the appearance at 2 o'clock Tuesday afternoon of Joseph P. Ryan , president of the International Longshoremen 's Association . The council also called on another affiliated union , the Unites Automobile Workers , to revoke the charter of a New York local headed by a convicted extortionist . If the automobile union refuses to comply , the council has the power to recommend that it be expelled from the federation at the next annual convention . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Monte Carlo Hotel here , the executive council set Feb. 21 as the date for resumption of formal peace talks between the A. F. L. and the // . Congress of Industrial Organize , ' Icons . The talks , to be held ini ' Washington , will represent the first negotiations for labor unity ? Since July , 1950. - The three major developments , ' ' crowded into a two-hour session , ' " ' Made it plain that a new and ! . - brisker tempo had been introduced into the federation 's activities by - the election two months ago of George Meany as its president . To " day 's council meeting was the first " over which Mr. Meany presided . ' , since he was chosen to succeed the - late William Green . ? The council 's action on the long  --  shore union was prompted by disclosures before the New York . State Crime . Commission that the . union was being used by ex-con ? : victs as an instrument for shake ? - downs and exploitation of the union rank and file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's meeting showed a unanimous sentiment on The part of the A. F. L. high com ? mand for action to force a house cleaning in the pier union . Ousting Plea Overruled Some council members urged that the longshoremen 's union be - dropped from the federation , but this idea was overruled on the ground that it would deprive the 60,000 union members of their last link to honest trade unionism , give - gangsters on the docks a free hand to run things their own way and open the door for an invasion of . the Atlantic and Gulf coasts by Harry Bridges , pro-Communist head of the West Coast independ : ent union of longshoremen . The special three-man committee was instructed to study a digest of the testimony at the crime commission hearings in New York and draw up a statement for issuance by the executive council expressing condemnation of the corrupt practices that had been allowed to develop in the union . The special committee is headed by Charles J. , president : of the International Brotherhood : , of Boilermakers . Its other mem-hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Electrical Workers , and George M. Harrison , president of the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks . The longshore union lost no time in issuing a statement applauding the executive council 's action . Louis Waldman , its counsel , who arrived here yesterday , told re-porters : " We are very happy that our parent organization , the American Federation of Labor , is willing to extend a helping hand in any construction job that has to be done to establish and maintain decent conditions in the Port of New York . " Trip by Ryan Announced Mr. Waldman announced that Mr. Ryan would come to Miami Beach and seek an opportunity to appear before the executive council . Mr. Meany , however , exhibited no enthusiasm about Mr. Ryan 's visit . He said that the pier union head had not been invited , but indicated that he would be heard if he asked for a chance to appear . " The question of crime on the waterfront is a problem for the police , the courts and other law enforcement agencies , " Mr. Meany declared . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the A. F. L. a great deal of concern . The question that arises from the crime commission testimony is whether the union is benefiting the workers on the docks or wheth- ! er it is taking away their rights , and privileges and , in many cases , their income . " The executive council 's call for revocation of the charter of the automobile union 's New York local came after an investigation by a nine-month-old anti-racketeering committee headed by Mr. Meany . He said that the investigation had convinced the executive council that the New York charter had been issued to persons with unsavory backgrounds who had no visible connection with the union Movement and that they were operating outside the assigned jurisdiction of the parent union . Involved is Local 102 . The A. F. L. automobile union has 150,000 members and the New York local about 2,000 . The president of the local is John Dioguardi , an eat ? convict , who ; was imprisoned in the Thirties'for alleged complicity in the garment trucking racket of Louis ( Lepke ) Buchalter . Local 102 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers in textile warehouses , machine shops and a variety of other fields . In recent months it has concentrated on organizing taxicab drivers . It has won several elections in New York taxi fleets and has called a number of twentyfour-hour strikes . Lester Washburn , president of the automotive international , said that it would not decide what to do about the executive council demand until it had received a formal communication from Mr. Meany . Reached by telephone at his headquarters in Milwaukee , Mr. Washburn said : " We have made diligent inquiry and have found no evidence to justify revocation of Local 102 's charter . We have always assured the A. F. L. that we would take action on our o ' . vn initiative if we found anything wrong . We will wait for word from the federation ' before we decided what our next step should be . " Insurgents Issue Warning Leaders here of an insurgent faction ' of the International Longshoremen 's Association notified Mr. Meany last night that they would not be satisfied with any " phony reform program " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The insurgents , who are headed by John J. ( Gene ) Sampson , busiIness manager of Local 791 , offered to supply any information on the dock situation that A.F.L. officials might want .
