txt The newsmen first obtained a foothold within the White House in the days of Theodore Roosevelt half a century ago . Before that they stayed away or stood outside in all sorts of weather . It would have been a shame if progress were to be reversed , as has recently been rumored , by exiling them to the old State Department Building across the street . The formal Presidential press conference  --  as distinct from occasional contacts between the President and the newspaper men ? goes back to the Administration of President Wilson , who inaugurated such conferences and then , under the pressure of war , gave them up . Again , it would have been extremely unfortunate if President Eisenhower had decided that these should no longer take place , It would have been a somewhat unhappy reversal , too , if , as again was rumored , President Eisenhower had decided to go back to requiring written questions , as Mr. Harding did , in place of the free give and take which was so successful during Franklin D. Roosevelt 's Administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings ; that he will on occasion bring to such meetings Cabinet members who can explain details of important problems , and that he may even try the experiment of talking directly to the nation once a month or so by means of television . Down to this point we may all of us rejoice  --  including those who are not journalists as well as those who are . This newspaper 's correspondent James Reston , writing from Washington for our Review of the Week last Sunday , made the excellent point that the press conference is not a matter of the " rights and conveniences of reporters " but that it is " the only direct and regular contact between the people and their President . " To be sure , the President is free at any time to express himself by means of a message to Congress , by a statement given out to the newspaper and radio services , by an address or by an open letter . Practically anything he cares to say is news . The advantage of the regular press conference is that it gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say and that it also gives him information as to what two or three hundred newspaper men think the public would like to know . The press conference , temporarily at least , relieves the President of dependence on a chain of advisers and informants . It is an occasion when the barriers are down and the divinity that doth hedge even an American President is to a large extent forgotten . Some Presidents more than others have had the ability to handle themselves effectively in a press conference . Franklin D. Roosevelt , for example , was far better at this game of give and take than Hoover , Coolidge or Harding . But this is a skill that can no doubt be learned , and we may suppose that President Eisenhower , a man of a quick and able mind and long experience , can acquire it . Some reporters got the impression during the campaign that General Eisenhower , as he then was , did not care to meet the reporters . The reason was apparently that as a candidate he preferred to say after his own fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voters . Now his role has Changed . Re needs as much support as he can get , in and out of the Republican party . The more clearly he can explain-himself-with the help of that able body of journalists who cover Washington the better it will be . " " One reservation may be-made as to the suggestion that some press confer- ences be televised . Televised press conferences , with each reporter trying to look his best and each word indelibly recorded in a form open to criti cal scrutiny , would not be press conferences at all . They would be , as experiments have shown , a vaudeville act . We hope that President Eisenhower will not take this risk . On theother hand , he might effectively deliver over radio and television an uninterrupted speech .. prepared in advance and addressed to all his fellow-citizens . The point is that all reasonable lines of communication between the White House and the nation should be kept open . This objective , so essential to our continuing democracy in these days of tremendous decisions , rises above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . -
