When Fair Deal trustbusters three years ago charged nine of the biggest U.S. paint companies with conspiring to fix prices , seven of the accused pleaded nolo contendere and paid $5,000 fines apiece . Only E. I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co. and the Glidden Co. decided to fight the charge . During a 50-day jury trial in Pittsburgh 's federal district court , Du Pont and Glidden argued that they had exchanged price information but had not fixed prices . Their licensing of patents on lacquer , they insisted , was well within the law . <P> Last week the jury brought in its verdict : not guilty . Glidden 's President Dwight P. Joyce estimated the trial cost his company $100,000 , but he thought it was worth the fight . Said he : " Had we pleaded nolo contendere , we would have had to pay only $5,000 . But it was well worth the $95,000 to take the stigma off the company 's name . And maybe it will encourage other companies to fight flimsy charges . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
