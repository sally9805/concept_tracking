A FEW QUICK ONES ( 213 pp. ) -P . G. Wodehouse-Simon &; Schuster ( $3.50 ) . <P> Today 's dean of British humorists is a 77-year-old U.S. citizen who has lived in America on and off for half a century and now resides permanently at Remsenberg , L.I . The blurb to his new book of ten short stories suggests that " the sound of his clicking typewriter keys beats a gentle staccato against the roar of the ocean surf . " The volume is recognizable Wodehouse , gently satirical , its barbs wielded with whimsy . But the more remarkable thing about Pelham Grenville Wodehouse in his twilight years is the way the decades of ocean-hopping have scrambled his language until all international date lines and regional distinctions tend to disappear . In a sense , he reflects the overall scrambling of English and American speech ever since the first World War II G.I.s came home spouting such Briticisms as " bloody " and " old top . " <P> Most Wodehouse characters live in England , but they have a curiously American shine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Leon Wilson flappers of pre-World War I America-the America first known to Wodehouse-were it not for the fact that they are simultaneously as British as Poet John Betjeman 's strong-armed Dianas ; they display the " outer crust ... of Miss Marilyn Monroe , " and yet still manage to draw from their swains such modish endearments of the British ' 20s as a " tenderly " spoken " old blighter . " Wodehouse heroes are often golfers , but they play upon courses which seem to be suspended in mid-Atlantic , uncertain whether to nationalize in yesterday 's Surrey or today 's Eastern Seaboard . His people voice such dated Americanisms as " bozo " or " They said a mouthful . " and also manage to class themselves with London 's Angry Young Men of today . <P> In a Wodehouse story it is perfectly natural for the cartoonist of a syndicated U.S. comic strip to find himself sharing a British beach resort with contenders in an American-type " Beautiful Babies " contest , for a New York publisher to be found naked in the hothouse of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Edwardian London 's Drones Club to consult Webster 's Dictionary rather than the Oxford . Victorian and Edwardian euphemisms such as " bally " and " ruddy " work their way into the tale of a British knight who once " allowed some hornswoggling highbinder to stick him with . . . dud Smelly River Ordinaries " *-and , of course , there are the usual Wodehousian references to or quotations from Shakespeare and Wordsworth , Walt Whitman , Lord Tennyson and Publishers Knopf , Holt , Doubleday , Simon &; Schuster-all balled up together . <P> The latest ten stories from the dean are the same bally old mixtures as before and will be ruddily gulped down by Wodehouse fans . The serious student of English will not fare so well : any page chosen at random will leave him ( in the Wodehouse phrase ) with the " drawn , haggard look . . . a man wears when one of his drives , intended to go due north , has gone nor ' - nor ' - east .
