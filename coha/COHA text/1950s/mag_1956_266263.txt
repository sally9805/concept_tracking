A decade ago Samuel ( Adagio for Strings ) Barber wrote a piece of music for Dancer Martha Graham called Cave of the Heart . It dealt with a Medea-like woman whose consuming love turned to hate and revenge ; the score followed the choreography closely in mood and motion . Last week Dimitri Mitropoulos and the Philharmonic-Symphony played Barber 's recomposition of the same scenes , called Medea 's Meditation and Dance of Vengeance . It turned out to be a meatier work for full symphony than as a dance accompaniment , with the same virtues-and the same faults-that have made Barber , 45 , one of the most-performed of contemporary American composers . <P> Among the virtues : a firm command of the orchestra , which produced a vividly mysterious opening figure on the xylophone , and two flutes that appear to bump and separate like a pair of slow-motion dancers . Chief fault : thematic aimlessness . After the promise of those opening bars , the next part of the brief score is limp and weary-a routine expression of Medea 's mother love . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vengeance " do things liven up again . At that point Conductor Mitropoulos took over the dancer 's role for himself , shrugging one shoulder grotesquely to the syncopated piano rhythm , splaying the fingers of his left hand to the spastic tempos . The music got more conventional in texture as it got noisier , but ultimately , sheer noise was sufficient : as the last , clubbing chord thundered out , the Philharmonic 's subscribers gasped , and then burst into applause . <P> Ahead for Composer Barber : a new opera , with a libretto written by his composer-friend , Gian-Carlo ( Saint of Bleecker Street ) Menotti.
