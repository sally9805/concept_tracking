txt The leaders of the nations are looking at one another in a new way All of this traveling that is being done is having a profound effect behind the stage where statesmen and diplomats strike poses . and make speeches . The reporter in Belgrade who said that Nikita S. Khrushchev , First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party , got out of his plane looking " half life-size " came very close to one of the most important truths of today . Actually , Mr. Khrushchev looked not half life-size , but human size . Suddenly , it became apparent that even a Kremlin leader could be human . This week at San Francisco Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov too began to look human , instead of super . The diplomats of both East and West for some months have been seeing one another more in human terms , less in the stark , red and white , contrasting terms of the cold war . Red Spectacles Doffed ? No man can say just when this humanizing process started . Perhaps it was when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to seize the passing of Stalin as the occasion to launch atomic war on the Soviet Union . The first clear evidence that Moscow itself was beginning to see the outside world in objective rather than in ideological terms was when Mr. Molotov , on Feb. 8 , noted with considerable accuracy that the Korean war was a major reason for the defeat of the Democrats in the 1952 American elections . Works Two Ways Since then . there has been increasing evidence that the men in Moscow have taken off their red spectacles and are looking at the world around them , and the people in it , as human beings who even though capitalists are capable of achieving useful things . For example , Mr. Khrushchev long since has recognized that the Soviet Union might learn something about corn-hog agriculture from the United States . For another example , Soviet military leaders have been telling their subordinates to acquire a new respect for " bourgeois " military science . For another example , Soviet Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin and Mr. Khrushchev in Belgrade expressed real curiosity about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communism . Perhaps the men of Moscow have even begun to see their " coreligionists " in Peking in more candid terms . There are some signs that th , .. y no longer attribute all virtue to the Chinese Communists just because they are Communists . The process is working in the West as well . What motivate : , men in the Kremlin ? All through the cold war , the stock ** answer was communism : just as the counter answer in the Kremlin about the West presumably would have been capitalism . But the diplomats of Washington , London , Paris , and Bonn have long since tried to look deeper and to search for possible other explanations . Is it really so simple , after all , as just com-munism ? These Western diplomats are getting ready to go to Geneva right now with some hope in their hearts because . they have come up with other answers . If the answers were just commun:sm , then there would be no point in going to Geneva , point in exploring possibilities for some agreements in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West . But these diggings below the surface have turned up new ideas , new approaches to olds questions . New Theory Explored Perhaps the men of Moscow are motivated not just by malevolence , but also by problems , by anxieties , by suspicions of one another , perhaps even by the sort of things which produce political life in Western countries . There is even a theory , explored of late in reports from the Western embassies in Moscow , that when you scrape off the surface uniformity of the men in the Kremlin you find down underneath that there are two schools of thought , two cliques , almost two political parties which vie with each other for control of the Kremlin and its policies , just as there are two major parties in Britain and in the United States which contend with each other for control of their respective governments . Mr. Khrushchev is plainly a " party " man , understandably since he is First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . Constantly , in his speeches , he gives all credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there are others in th , - : Kremlin who seldom , in some cases never , mention the party in their public speeches . How does one explain this except by the theory of underlying differences between two groups in the Kremlin ? But if there are two groups , why has one not liquidated the other in the Stalin-Trotsky tradition ? Perhaps they have come to prefer the semisecurity of internal coexistence to the lesser security of classic liussian political life in which the loser , literally , loses all . If so , does this mean the first faint germination of a two-party political system ? Perhaps . If there is ircrit this theory , is the supposed condition one which might in any way he encouraged by the West ? Is one group in the Kremlin possibly ' less bellicose than the other , less reluctant to blow up the world with atomic weapons , more receptive to ideas which could lead to a softening not only of the dictatorship in Moscow but also of the whole Stalin system ? West . Changes View These arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is new that Western diplomats consider it important to explore such areas of theory and speculation . It is new that this kind of thinking plays . a major role in the preparations for a great diplomatic conference such as the one looming ahead at Geneva . Whether the Kremlin has taken off its red glasses is speculative . That the West has taken off its own white ( or black ? ) glasses is certain . Not only is this true of the diplomats . It also is true of the United States Senate . When that august body of men voted by 77 to 4 this week to give President . Eisen-hewer a tree hand for negotiation at Geneva , it recognized the possibility that there might be a nonidcological context for negotiation with the Soviets . The proposal before the Senate , by Senator . Joseph ft . McCarthy ( It ) of Wisconsin , was in effect that the President should make the liberation of the Eastern European satellites from communism a precondition for negotiations . Any senator who believes that communism is the mainspring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that resolution . Exactly four supported it . What the Senate really did was to express a majority opinlln that there is enough change in the way men are looking at one another across the old Iron Curtain to justify and permit a serious effort to undertake serious negotiations across that barrier .
