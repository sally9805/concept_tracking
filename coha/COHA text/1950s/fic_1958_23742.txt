A Story by AUBREY GOODMAN Drawings by Peggy Lloyd Sweetheart , Sweetheart , Sweetheart N 1 V WIFE hit me in the mouth with a satin shoe , " Willy told me . " What do you know , " I said , looking at the small clock over the bar . Mary Elizabeth and Alan were twenty minutes late , but I did n't mind waiting for them . " I know she hit me in the mouth with a shoe , " Willy said , fishing an ice cube out of his glass . " Remember that time Tracy Whatzername came down to Yale for the Harvard game and whacked me across the shins with a lacrosse stick just because I - . . " I was n't listening to Willy , because heard the story a dozen times . I had favorite bars in New York , but this was not one of them . It was almost a private club and had the air of a college fraternity . This . was not accidental , because the small crowd of young people who came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the clubs of Princeton and Harvard and Yale . They had come separately to New York where they found jobs and places to live and places to drink . And many of them selected one of two or three bars like this one where they could surround themselves with old faces and old friends and sit around the dark-paneled room and tell old stories . The attempt to recreate the fun of their college years was , of course , a flop . It led these people in their middle twenties through too many drinks , toomany casual love affairs , and much too much bright talk . " Remember the time . . . " and " Did n't von know . . . " started off most of the conversations between men named Lansing and Bo Bo and Winthrop and Judson and ladies referred to as Honeybear and Alison and Choo Choo and Valerie and Annabelle . They had outgrown the prep school crowd and Dixieland jazz of Eddie Condon 's , grown tired of the smooth young men and bright young debs who crowd the dance floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially and socially , by the flashy ringside crew at El Morocco . And so this tiny bar , tucked away in the East Eighties , became their retreat and watering hole , where they could sit among the old faces and listen to the old Cole Porter prom songs on the juke box and tell old stories and drink old Scotch  --  trying desperately to forget that they , themselves , were growing older . I I. E F T Willy and walked to the back of the room to the juke box . A woman in red was sitting alone at a table near the large fireplace and she was telling the waiter , " But I 'm ? not alone . I 'm waiting for some friends . " I ignored " It Was Just One of Those Things " and " This Is It " and chose some records by Tony Perkins , Elvis Presley , and Johnnie Ray . " Do n't be croo-ool , " Presley 's voice boomed , 59 accompanied by some sort of violent instrumental thumping background , " to a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nearby table gave me a funny look and one girl wrinkled up her nose as if she smelled something stinky in the air . I smiled and walked back to the bar where I found Mary Elizabeth and Alan . " Happy birthday ! " Mary Elizabeth said , hugging me . " How does it feel to be twenty-two ? " " Does n't feel like twenty-one any more , " I replied . M ARY ELIZABETHwasatall , lovely , and charming girl who worked as a model . You 've probably seen her picture several times in fashion magazines . She was originally from Iowa , but seven years at a school in England had gifted her with a slight accent that did n't sound affected at all . As a matter of fact , it added to her charm . Alan clapped me on the back , and we all sat down at a table near the fireplace . After Alan ordered the drinks , Mary Elizabeth stood up and asked for fifty cents . " Have prices gone up in the ladies ' room ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters please , " Mary Elizabeth said . " 1 want to play some beautiful music for you . " She walked back to the juke box , and I told Alan that I had seen Jean the week before . " She 's going to Mexico to get the divorce , " he said . " That 's what she told me . " Alan sighed and said , " I 'll be glad when this is all cleared up . " I agreed with him . " I guess it 's ridiculous to let it drag on any longer . You and Jean have been separated for two years . " A girl at the bar was kissing her date 's ear . " Cut it out , " the man said crossly . " Cut it the hell out . " Mary Elizabeth came back and sat down just as the waiter finished putting our drinks on the table . " The waiters here " There is absolutely no such thing as too much of a good thing , " Mary Elizabeth said . " When this round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's terrific , " I said . She put her hand over Alan 's hand and smiled prettily at him and said , " You 're a prince of a man . And I love you . " Alan smiled hack at her and said , " You 're mad . " " Stop that , " I demanded . " You make me feel left out . ' ' " Awwwww , " Mary Elizabeth said , reaching across and stroking my cheek . " We have to find a girl for you , Art . A lovely girl . A regular sweetheart of a girl . Because it 's your birthday and you 're so nice . " " I had a lovely girl , " I told her . " And she married somebody else . " " Why ? " she wanted to know . " Because he asked her , " I said simply . " Was she wonderful and lovely ? " Mary Elizabeth asked . " No , " I replied , making rings on the table with my glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all that matters , " she remarked , picking up a cigarette and waiting for Alan to light it for her . " First loves never work out , " I said . " They always last , but they never work out . " Mary Elizabeth frowned . " Do n't say that . " " That was a long time ago , " Alan said to me . " Everyone has loved someone who married somebody else . " " I never did , " Mary Elizabeth said , looking at Alan . " I was never in love with anyone ever before you . " She turned to me and said , " When I was living in Europe , these marvelously rich , handsome , brilliant young men kept falling in love with me . But I could never fall in love with ally of them . I was beginning to think something was wrong with me . And then I met the handsome gentleman here who 's playing footsie with me right now under the table . " " And the rest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . " We 're a mathematical sequence , " I told them . " Mary Elizabeth , you 're twenty-one . I 'm twenty-two now . And Alan , you 're twenty-three . Maybe we add up to something . " " People , " Alan said , draining his drink , " never add up . " He looked around for the waiter and Mary Elizabeth giggled . " I do n't think Alan 's mother likes me very much , " she confessed to me . " She gave me an 60 SWEETHEART , SWEETHEART , SWEETHEART uncomfortable pair of walking shoes and a crocodile suitcase . Do you think that 's a hint to clear out of town ? " " Yes , " Alan replied . " You 're sweet , " Mary Elizabeth smiled . " But I adore you anyhow . " A LA N went down to the men 's room , and we leaned back in our chairs and listened to her favorite record . She stretched one arm luxuriously in the air and began to sing along with Tony Perkins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile on her lips , " for heaven 's sake . " " You seem very content , " I said , interrupting her serenade . She nodded slowly , her eyes closed , singing quietly again . Then she sat forward and talked directly to me . " I am happy , " she said . " Jean is going to Mexico - to get the divorce . Finally . I 've been waiting for over a year , and it was beginning to seem hopeless and gloomy and impossible . But it 's all working out beautifully now . Alan gave me a present today . A scarf . Was n't that sweet ? It 's a magnificent scarf . Silver . " " Good , " I said , nodding once . " Alan is the most marvelous man . The most splendid man , " she told me . " There 's only one phrase that describes him . He is a prince of a man . Other men are all those other adjectives , but Alan is the only man in the world who ever was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " Alan came back to the table . " Hello , Prince , " I said . " What ? " " You 're a girl ? You could he somewhere  --  some room , or some party , some place . And this perfect person just appears and you see each other . And it 's as if everything is illuminated inside you and you become aware of yourself and of the other person . It 's one of those moments . And who knows when she 'll come onto the scene ? " " Or when she 'll make her exit , " I added . " True , " she said , thinking it over . " Still , you do n't know , do you ? " " I do n't know anything , " I replied , smiling . A fat woman came into the bar alone and ordered a drink . She wore orange hair and a shiny black cocktail dress . Someone must have made a remark about her for I heard an outburst of laughter from another table . A girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tomorrow ! " she told a man who was talking to some other men . " Do n't forget to call me tomorrow ! " The man kept on talking to his friends , and the girl left . " I do n't want to go to the Stork Club , " Alan said suddenly . " Why not ? " I asked . " The balloons make me nervous , " he said . " You 're terrible , " Mary Elizabeth said . " Is n't he terrible ? " She looked at me for agreement , and I shrugged . " Balloons pop , " Alan explained . " You 're terrible , " Mary Elizabeth told him . " That 's why I love you . " The woman in red at the table alone stood up and went downstairs . She was wearing a red sweater , red slacks , and gold shoes . She was small and had bright yellow hair cut in bangs . Willy passed by our table and greeted Alan and Mary Elizabeth . " What 's new ? " Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's not new , " Alan muttered , and Willy moved along . " We fought all last week , " Mary Elizabeth told me confidentially . " I was on edge . I was getting nervous about the divorce and everything seemed to be taking such a terribly long time that I became cross and decided to go away . I was going to California . Or to Paris . Or to South America . Or to Iowa . " Alan looked at her seriously and said , " You were n't really going away , were you ? " " Yes , " she said . " I was . I was going away . " " What would you do , " Alan asked , " if I went away ? " She sat completely still for a moment . Then she looked at him with a grave face and said , " I 'd die . I 'd lie down and die . I could n't go on living without my prince of a man . " I rapped on the table with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! left out again . " The fat lady with the orange hair walked unsteadily past us and started down the stairs . A minute later the woman in red came up the stairs and sat down alone again at the table next 10 ours . " Did you see that woman ? " she asked us . Who is she ? She nearly knocked me down the stairs ! " The three of us laughed , and the woman in red grinned . " She nearly made a fallen woman of me ! " she ? t ? . xclaimed . We laughed louder . The laughter died away as quickly as it had begun , and the lady kept looking at our faces . She was not young , but there was something ridiculously childlike about her red costume and gold shoes and yellow haircut . Her eyes were steady and glazed , and the perfume she wore was heavy , strong , and expensive . Her voice was low and husky and carried more than a hint of the South . She wore a lot of gold jewelry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornament , something to hang on a Christmas tree . She tucked one leg under her and stared at Mary Elizabeth . " You 're a pretty girl , " she said . She was n't smiling now , and her remark sounded more like an accusation than a compliment . " I 'm waiting here for my friends . These people love me . Why ? I do n't know why they do , but they do . They 're foolish people . Is my face all right ? Can you tell I 've been crying ? " " No , " Mary Elizabeth replied , watching her carefully . The bartender had left the bar and was lighting a fire in the fireplace . " Well , " the woman said , picking up her drink , " I have been crying . Since yesterday . You see , yesterday this man ... this man told me . oh , well , you do n't want to hear about it . " She took a long swallow from her glass . " But these people , " she continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips , " love me , Arid they are coming to help me . You 're a very pretty girl . " She looked sadly at Mary Elizabeth . " It 's girls like you , " she said , " who have made my life a living hell . " Mary Elizabeth looked worried and said , " Oh . I hope that 's not so . " " It 's true , " she said . I noticed that she spoke slowly . None of her words were slurred out , but she paused between each word . Suddenly she smiled brightly and said , " I 'm all right now though . I 'M not very brave , but I 'm fine now . You see , this man was my sweetheart for seven years . I thought we were going to be married eventually but . . She broke off , and tears welled up in her eyes . " I hope you do n't think I 'm terrible , " she said , her voice trembling . " No , no , " Mary Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pretty , " the woman said in a sudden gay voice . " When I was at Sweet Briar , I was like a little .. a little pixie ! And now I 'm getting to be like an elf . " She smiled , and Mary Elizabeth smiled with her . " And in a few years , " the woman went on , " I 'll he like a dwarf . " The corners of her mouth turned down . " And then I 'll he a little wrinkled-up gnome and nobody will want me . " Mary Elizabeth 's smile faded away . " Of course , I do n't know what difference it makes , " the woman said . " It looks to me like nobody wants me now . 1 do n't know what else to think . I really do n't . " She held her chin high in the air and a tear rolled down her cheek . She wiped it away and smiled bravely . " Of course , I still have my memories . And that 's something , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where would we be without our memories ? " Mary Elizabeth opened her mouth to answer , but the woman made a reply to her own ques-62 SWEETHEART , SWEETHEA tion when she looked into her glass and said , " Where would we be without our memories ? We 'd be a lot better off . That 's where we 'd be. - Then she lifted her head and looked at each of us . " I hope I 'm not bothering you , " she said . " But I do n't know what to do . These friends of mine , these foolish , kind people , they . . . this man I 've been involved with for seven years called me up yesterday . . . and told me . .. he was getting married . . . in twenty minutes ! " Each word was like a spoonful of bitter medicine to her . " And he did ! " she continued , shaking her head unbelievingly . " Twenty minutes later . . he was married ! I mean . I knew this other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just ... out of the blue like that ? And after seven years ? " Mary Elizabeth looked truly astonished . " Unbelievable ! " the woman said . There were tears in Mary Elizabeth 's eyes and in the woman 's eyes , and she leaned over and took Mary Elizabeth 's hands in hers . " What would you do ? " she asked . " What would you du ? " " I 'd die , " Mary Elizabeth said quietly . " I 'd just die . " . The woman sat bark in her chair and shook her head . " I told him , " she said . " I told him I was n't so old . But I do n't blame him . Yes , I do . No . No , I do n't . I do n't know . I blame him and I blame myself and I blame nobody and everybody . It 's easier if you can blame someone , do n't you think so ? " She wiped her eyes . " I 'm thirty , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm thirty-six . Why lie ? " " That 's right , " Mary Elizabeth said helpfully . " Why lie ? " the woman repeated . " Good heavens , you 've got to lie ! What else can you do ? " Mary Elizabeth nodded understandingly . " Did you see what I just did ? " the woman asked . " I answered my own question . That 's a bad sign . Sometimes when I 'm drinking I feel like I 'm two people and sometimes I feel like I 'm not even one person , no person at all . And sometimes I feel that way even when I 'm not drinking . " She picked up her glass and drank , and Mary Elizabeth looked unhappily at Alan and me as if she expected us to do something . " 1 do n't know what it was , " the woman told us . " A few years ago I thought it was money . " RT , SWEETHEART " Money ? " Mary Elizabeth asked , not understanding . " Honey , money 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I blinked and said , " Oh . " " What do you think ? " she asked . " What ? " None of us answered , and the woman sighed . " Nothing , " she said sadly . " I guess that is the answer . " I lit a cigarette and Mary Elizabeth took it from me and handed it to the woman . " Thank you , sweetheart , " she said , smiling her false bright smile . " You see ? All I needed was to talk to someone and I knew this bad feeling would go away . " A WOMAN in a black dress and a short man with a pinched face came up to her table . " Dolores ! " the woman into teats . Mary Elizabeth and Alan and I turned away from them . " God , " Alan said under his breath . The people were comforting the woman , patting her hand and crooning to her . " That girl at the next table , " the woman sobbed . " She said ... she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill myself ! " Dolores shot its an angry glance , and Mary Elizabeth sat up straight in her chair and looked horrified . " I need another drink , " the woman said . " My nerves are gone . " " Pull yourself together , " Dolores told her in a hard voice . " We 're due at a party and we 're late now . We 'll take you with us . Where is your coat ? " The man picked up a fur coat that had fallen to the floor , and Dolores practically lifted the woman to her feet . " You 'll have to change , " Dolores said , putting the woman 's arms into the sleeves of her coat . " You 'll have to change , and then we can go on to the party . " " Whose party ? " the woman asked , reaching under the table for her handbag . " Who will be there ? " " Some people you do n't know , " the man said impatiently . " You 'll like them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . You 'll have to put on something else . " " All right , " the woman said , wearily . We had been sitting there silently , listening , and we watched them walk to the door . The woman in red stopped , said something to the man and woman and then came back to our table . " Oh God , what now , " Alan sighed . The woman stood by our table and said , " I just wanted to thank you all . You were very kind . " She looked straight at Mary Elizabeth . " Sweetheart , " she said , putting her hand on Mary Elizabeth 's shoulder , " do n't count on anyone . Do n't depend on anybody in this world . Because we 're all undependable . " She turned her head to me and said , " When you do n't have someone , it 's hell . And when you do have someone , it 's hell . And that 's the way it is . " The couple waiting at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called . " We have to move on ! " " I wish I was young and lovely again , " the woman said wistfully . Mary Elizabeth looked up at her and said , " I think you 're a lovely girl . " " You 're a lucky young man , " the woman told Alan . Alan nodded uncomfortably . " Well , " the woman said . She took a silver scarf from the pocket of her fur coat and tied it over her head . " I 'm not going to be bitter . My sweetheart gave me this scarf . He was awonderful man . " She smiled that brave , pathetic smile again . " He was a prince of a man , " the woman said , " and I 'm sorry I lost him . " S H E wrapped her coat tight around her , turned and walked proudly out of the bar with Dolores and the short man at her side . " What a character , " Alan said . " Where 's the waiter ? " I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at her hands . " Let 's go to the Blue Angel , " I said enthusiastically . Mary Elizabeth reached over and gripped Alan 's arm . " Hey , " Alan said . " What 's the matter ? " There was a frightened look on her face as she stared across the table into his eyes and said , " jean is going to Mexico , is n't she ? And everything is going to be beautiful , is n't it ? " Alan sighed and said , " For God 's sake , Mary Elizabeth ! " I got up and went to the bar and stood by Willy , who began to tell me about the time some girl had whacked him across the shins with a lacrosse stick . And although I was trying to find a temporary peaceful place of relief , not in the present , not in the future , but in someone else 's past , I could hear the voices of Mary Elizabeth and Alan  --  growing louder and louder .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
