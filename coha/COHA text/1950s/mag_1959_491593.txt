He is a comedian who can make you cry . He is a serious man who can make you laugh . For Danny Thomas , these diverse talents have paid off . In November , 1958 , they landed his " clean and wholesome , " C.B.S . family-type TV show at the top of the Trendex rating list , ahead of such rugged competition as Gunsmoke , Wagon Train , Perry Como , What 's My Line , Person to Person , Wyatt Earp , and Maverick . I first met Danny Thomas in a high-toned Beverly Hills rib-joint because I was with a friend who knew him . At times Ile looks startlingly like Cary Grant . Then you get a load of his nose and the Grant illusion fades . His nose is pure Lebanese . It resembles a small scimitar . Danny sat at our table and began to talk . His voice gathers pace and volume as it goes along . In no time at all it was winging . He was telling me things I wanted to put down on paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow , or I do n't get it . So I did the only thing that I could think of to dam his verbal torrent . I said , " I have to wash my hands . " When I came back , Danny said , " I get it . I was talking too much and too fast . " " Next time , " I told him , " I 'll be prepared to trap your words so I wo n't lose them . " Several weeks later I waited for him in the lobby of a hotel in New York while he completed a nonstop flight from Los Angeles to Idlewild . When he arrived pandemonium broke loose . Bellhops , elevator men , maids , people from room service , an elderly man with a roaring vacuum cleaner , all shouted greetings to him . They were n't tip-begging greetings . They knew him and liked him . When the hullabaloo died , Danny loosened his tic , took off his coat , sat down and told me , " The thing that scares me about telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my special feeling for Saint Jude .

I 'm not trying to convert anybody . I pray the only way I know how ; strictly informal . Once there was a play , My Brother Talks to Horses . I , however , talked to marble statues , or rather , to one marble kstatue . Everyone said it could n't hear , but I was sure the saint it represented could hear me . And I got answers .

The regular doctor was n't available , so a veterinarian delivered me . Our family rarely discuss that farm because it was a sadness in my father 's life . He lost it when I was only a few months old . He ran out of dough . L- " Mom was so ill she almost died after I was q'born . Aunt Julia came out to the farm to take care of me when mom was so desperately sick . She became attached to me and I to her . Then we all ( Continued on Page 69 ) January 17 , 1969 moved to Toledo from Deerfield . By .311 ' I mean Uncle Tony and Aunt Julia and my folks . " My brothers and 1 have eloquent Arabic names .

" At that time , dad was driving a dry-goods wagon through lower Michigan towns like Dundee , Tecumseh , Monroe and Coldwater . My Arabic name is Muzyad , which means ' A Little Better . ' " He grinned . " I ' in surprised dad did n't add a syllable meaning ' but not much . ' " Uncle Tony and Aunt Julia moved into a two-family house in Toledo with my mom and my dad and my brothers . My folks lived downstairs because Uncle Tony could n't stand our feet battering the ceiling over his head . When I was a year and three months old , Uncle Tony was offered a good business opportunity in Detroit , and he decided that he and Aunt Julia should move there . Aunt Julia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go without me . That created a crisis . " Mom and dad realized that it would be a problem to take a baby  --  meaning me  --  away from a woman whose knowledge that she could not have children was eating on her . But if Uncle Tony did n't move , he would lose a setup which would be good for him , so he said , ' Why ca n't we bring up this baby ourselves ? My sister and her husband have very little money and they have four sons . ' Aunt Julia went downstairs to have a talk with my dad ; Uncle Tony sent for my mom , and each of them made a different pitch . " " Did anybody ever tell you what they said ? " I asked . Danny nodded . " In marrying Aunt Julia , Uncle Tony had taken my father 's intended bride . Dad had come to America to marry Julia , although he 'd never seen her . The match had been made by the parents . " " Not even a photograph sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Danny said . " But by the time my dad arrived in this country , Aunt Julia had fallen in love with a man named Tony Simon , and was determined to marry him . Aunt Julia 's parents said , ' We 've given our word that we will deliver our daughter , ' and my father 's parents said , ' We 've given our word we are going to deliver our son , ' but Aunt Julia was in love with Tony and that was that . " " What was Tony 's nationality ? " I asked . " Italian ? " " He was Lebanese too , " Danny told me . " To complicate things further , he was my mother 's brother , but Aunt Julia and Uncle Tony went off by horse and buggy and got themselves married in Dundee , Michigan . That uncomplicated things .

She Was fifteen and a half when she bore dad his first son . ( Continued from Page 21 ) " About the pitches Uncle Tony and Aunt Julia made as to who should have me , Aunt Julia told dad in Arabic ( which is untranslatable into English or any other language which will make it as beautiful as it is ) : ' Fate plays strange tricks . You came to America to marry me . From that marriage you expected many sons . Luckily for you , you did n't get me , because I am barren . But the Lord has blessed you with many sons . Now I 'm asking you for one of them . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand it was touching . " My dad rolled a cigarette and thought , " Danny went on . " He never spoke before he thought . I wish I had that trait . I blurt things out and sometimes they 're terrible . Dad put the cigarette behind his ear , then he said to Aunt Julia , ' My answer is you ca n't have him legally , but you can have him personally . From us . From the heart . Not from the law . All I ask is that you bring him up in the love of God. ? " What was your father 's religion ? " I asked . " Maronite Catholic , " Danny said . " I 'm one too . A Maronite is an Eastern Rite Roman Catholic . Saint John Maron is our patron saint . The Eastern Church of the Byzantine period split up into Greek Orthodox , Syrian Orthodox , Russian Orthodox and Ukrainian Orthodox , but the Maronites stayed a part of the Roman Catholic Church . " I stayed in Detroit with Uncle Tony and Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster parents brought me back to Toledo again . We lived about eight or nine blocks from my father , mother and brothers . Uncle Tony and Aunt Julia raised me . I was seven years old before I realized that Aunt Julia was n't my mother . " " Did somebody tell you ? " I asked . He said , " I finally realized that the other kids at school had mothers instead of Aunt Julias , and I asked why I was different . Aunt Julia and Uncle Tony looked at each other , then he took me on his lap and said , ' As little as you are , you must know I love you as much as any father could love his son , yet you 're not my boy . You belong to my sister and my brother-in-law . They trusted you to our care . To us , you are our son . ' " He told me very simply , " Danny said , " but I was so young I did n't get it at first . I had to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shocked ? " I asked . " No , " he told me . " But although I had n't realized my brother Ray was my brother . I was very fond of him , and when I found that he was really my brother , I was glad . I kept on living with Uncle 63 Tony and Aunt Julia all the way through grammar school and high school . I put in six years at Saint Francis de Sales parochial school in Toledo , and I spent two years in the seventh and eighth grades at Saint Joseph 's . My fourth-grade teacher is now mother superior of an Ursulinc convent . A few years ago , when I went to Toledo to appear in a benefit to rebuild the convent , I saw her again . She looked at me , her steel-gray eyes welled tears and she said , ' Praise the Lord , it 's you . I was afraid you 'd been executed for some deviltry or other . ' " While I was attending Saint Francis de Sales Cathedral School with my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gym . I belonged to the Newsboys Association , and the association played ball there and studied such vocations as shoemaking , basket weaving and journalism . " I thought that lumping shoemaking , journalism and basket weaving together was a pretty casual grouping , but I kept my thought to myself . " For a year I sold papers , " Danny told me . " Then , when I was eleven , I began to sell soda pop in the gallery of a burlesque theater . I did that for seven years . " " You must have learned a lot , " I said ; then I added hastily , " I mean about such things as timing . " " I saw Fanny Brice and Clark and McCullough there , " he told me , " but a Yiddish comedian named Abe Reynolds was my idol . The thing I remember most about him is that he was one of the cleanest comics I 've ever seen work . The burlesque house in which I sold pop was part of the Columbia Wheel . The shows there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when people instinctively connect burlesque with smut . What burlesque really means is ' making fun of the original , ' like taking a play and parodying it . But let 's get back to my semi-adoption by my Uncle Tony and Aunt Julia . It became a serious matter for me when they decided to leave Toledo . Now I knew who my brothers were , and this parting was great ' sorrow . I would miss my brother Ray and Toledo , too , because every year Toledo 's Woodward High put on a two-act musical show in twenty-two scenes . The sketches used were stolen from acts on the Columbia Burlesque Wheel . I stole them . I also borrowed costumes from the burlesque theater . If you worked in a Woodward High musical you got classroom credit for it , even if you were still in grammar school . My brother Ray and I were in the Woodward High musical when we were in eighth-grade parochial school . " But after all my foster parents had done for me , it would n't have been fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I went to Rochester , New York , with them and enrolled in Fast High there . A few days later I passed a Columbia burlesque theater and , remembering the Columbia house I 'd worked in in Toledo , I asked to see the manager . I was still in knee pants , but I told him , ' I 'd like a job candy-butchering for you . ' " ' Think you can sell prize packages ? ' he inquired . I said , ' Sure , ' but my heart jumped , for in TOledo prize packages were the top items . There was a prize in each package , and now and then a special prize . He gave me a tray of prize packages , and I spent the next half school year breaking all local truancy records . Mornings at nine 1 went to the Family Movie Theater , bought a ten-cent ticket and sat there until noon . That meant I had fifteen cents left for lunch . With that fifteen cents I bought two slices of bologna , a bun and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at noon because lots of high-school kids were on the streets then , and no one paid any attention to mc . When I ' finished lunch , I went into the burlesque theater and sat in an upstairs scat until matinee time . Then I sold my prize packages . I did that for four and a half months , but finally the truant officer caught up with me . " Aunt Julia was horrified to find out I had n't been going to school , " he went on . " She did n't know that I was in rebellion against being uprooted from Toledo . 1 wish now that I had had more formal education , because I speak by ear , and verbally I 'm often up a dead-end street . I went back to school for four days the first week after the juvenile authority caught me , but Friday of that week I skipped school and I was never forced to go back again . " The following year I could n't stand being away from Toledo any longer , so I moved back there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It turned out that Aunt Julia had missed her folks as much as I had missed mine , but she had n't told me . Back in Toledo , my brother Ray was a high-school sophomore . I 'd caught up with him classwise in parochial school because he 'd drunk a glass of kerosene on a dare , and it had made him sick for a long time , and later a stove fell on his legs ; but now he was a sophomore . He 'd gotten a year ahead of me again because I 'd played so much hooky in Rochester , but I was n't going to be separated from him any more , so I enrolled as a sophomore . My teachers passed me at the end of the year and I became a junior . " I got straight A 's in English . My English teacher , Miss Hammond , liked my oral reports . The other kids liked them too , for when I was called upon to give one on a book we 'd read , every kid in the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once I was on my feet I was good for forty minutes . " At the beginning of my junior year in Toledo , the principal called me in and inquired about my freshman credits . He said he had n't found any record of my having attended school in Rochester . ' Did you use a different name ? ' he asked . 1 said , ' 1 used my uncle 's name , Simon , instead of my own name , Jacobs . ' So he wrote to Rochester again , but by the time he heard from them once more it was mid-term , and the rehearsals for the annual Woodward High musical were under way . " This time I was a major part of the production . My brother Ray and I not only produced it , we were its principal comics . Ray was top banana and I was second banana . To make sure that no catcalls came our way , we used the school 's football and basketball players for our male chorus , and we had some gorgeous sixteen- and seventeen-year-old girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Rochester that Amos Simon ( also known as Jacobs ) had strung together a total of nine days as a high-school freshman . The verdict was that I would have to drop back and really take my freshman subjects , although I was earning passing marks as a junior . What hurt most was that if I did n't do that , I would have to drop out of the musical show , although the show was keeping the athletic department alive . We had a sorrowful football team that lost money , and the show made up the difference . It ran for two days in the city auditorium and it made around 517,000 , which was handed over to the school . " I said , " I should have thought that with that much at stake , somebody would have saved your bacon . " " Some kindhearted folk did try , " Danny said . " And the principal was asked to work out a probationary compromise with me . He decided that I should take three junior subjects and two freshman subjects . Even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my diploma . I said , ' Yes , sir , ' but when the curtain fell on the 1932 musical show , it ended my academic career  --  with the exception of a brief interlude . " That interlude came in 1950. 1 was planning a trip to London to play the Palladium , when I got a wire from the Toledo Board of Education , asking me to stop off en route to New York and accept an honorary high-school diploma from the mayor of the city , Michael V. Di Salle , who is now Ohio 's governor . As usual , I could n't refrain from making a speech . My opening line on that occasion was , ' As valedictorian of my class ... ' This struck the Class of 1950 as hilarious but , after all , as the only one in my class  --  the thrown-out class  --  why should n't I elect myself valedictorian ? " " Did you meet your future wife in high school ? " I asked . " Afterward , " he said . " First I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night watchman in the city coal-and-lumber yard . 1 saved enough money to buy two suits , two shirts , two ties and four pairs of shoes ; then I went to Detroit . I knew trying to get into show business would mean a lot of worn-out shoe leather . " " Was there theatrical work there ? " I asked . " Yes , " he told me , " and for a while I got lucky . I was hired as a straight singer for a radio program called the Happy Hour Club . My future wife , Rosemarie Mantell , was a member of the Happy Hour Club too . She 'd graduated to it from a kids ' program , although when I first met her she was just a kid herself . " " This business of falling for a girl as soon as she 's nubile seems to run in your family , " I said . He grinned at me and said , " I waited until Rosemarie was seventeen before we married . On January fifteenth we were married twenty-three years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twenty-one ; Theresa , sixteen ; Tony , ten . " After singing on radio , I occasionally worked in radio plays at WJR and on a program called News Comes to Life , which dramatized the news . I had tried to get on WJR for three years ; then , when George Gershwin died and WJR dramatized his life , there was a scene between Gershwin and Al Jolson , with Jolson singing Swanee . The station librarian remembered a hook-nosed kid in a beer garden doing a take-off on Jolson . That hook-nosed kid was me . They called my apartment and asked me to audition , but I had infected ears and I said , ' I 'm sorry , I ca n't . I 'm sick . ' " But they were desperate to put on the show that very night and they said , ' We 'll skip the audition . Just come over and you can have the job . ' I gulped codeine to kill my pain and went over . They said , ' Read these lines the way Joley would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Eric Howlett came out of a booth and said , ' Who 's doing the Jolson stuff ? ' He was told , ' The kid with the beak . ' And Eric said , ' If he can only sing like him , we 're in . ' I said , ' There 's no trick to that . I 've been doing it for years . ' He said , ' Sing me eight bars of Swanee . ' I did , and when I was through , they gave me a whole chorus of Swanee to sing . " Nevertheless , I was n't doing very well in Detroit when , in 1940 , 1 heard of Saint Jude Thaddaeus , the patron saint of the forgotten and the hopeless . Charley Deale , the head stagehand at the Michigan theater , told me about him . Charley 's wife had cancer , supposedly a hopeless case , but he prayed to Saint Jude Thaddaeus to give him his wife 's life , and she lived . " " It sounds miraculous , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for the benefit of those who do n't like to call things miracles , it could have been a good doctor . Whatever it was , Charley Deale credited his wife 's cure to Saint Jude , to whom he had prayed kneeling on a marble floor for so many hours that his kneecaps flattened out and he had to be helped to his feet . Charley got down on his knees about midnight ; then , at dawn , his wife 's doctor came up to him and said , ' Charley , I do n't know who you 're talking to , but whoever it is , thank him , for something peculiar is taking place . Nature is doing things for your wife that I do n't understand . I 'm calling the surgeon and I 'm having him come over with the staff doctors to see what 's going on . ' What happened was this : the cancer loosed itself from the body and it came away in one mass , clean as a whistle . " " I 've never heard of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Danny said . " But you could n't convince Charley Deale that Saint Jude did n't do it if you spouted all the scientific jazz at him you 've ever heard . Charley went out into the street shouting the name of Saint Jude like a madman . He seemed drunker than a hoot owl . I was doing a caf ? act at the time , and Charley came into the caf ? , grabbed me and said , ' Sit down . I want to buy you a drink . ' I said , ' No , thank you , ' but he said , ' You must listen . ' " I listened . He began to tell me about how he 'd prayed , and I thought , I not only hare a drunk on my hands , 1 hare a religious rummy on my hands . Charley took out a little pamphlet and said , ' I want you to have this . ' It was a two-page prayer to Saint Jude . It had been mailed by the Dominican Fathers from Saint Jude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me , I read about Saint Jude Thaddaeus . It turned out that he was the Apostle who 's second from the right in The Last Supper . " " He must have been called Thaddaeus in the Bible I studied , " I said . " I do n't remember any Jude . " " They did n't usually call him Judas because of Judas Iscariot , " Danny explained . " There was Judas Iscariot and Judas Thaddaeus . That 's why Saint Jude became the forgotten saint . His name being Judas too , people sometimes got him mixed up with the other Judas and said , ' skip him . ' And because so few pray to him , the prayers of those who do are answered promptly . Saint Jude is n't too busy . " It just happened that when I studied that pamphlet , I had reached an impasse in my own life . My contemporaries were being booked out of town at more money than I was getting . I could n't get into the nice places , which were sprouting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainer . The owners of the better places were booking classy stuff from Chicago and New York . I did n't tit in . " My wife kept after me to quit show business . ' Get a job in a grocery store , she begged . ' Do anything , but let 's lose this uncertain life of ours . ' It was then that I went into the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Detroit , to ask Saint Jude to help me find my way . 1 said to him : ' Help me find my place in life and I 'll build you a shrine that the poor , the helpless , and the hopeless can use when they come to you for aid . ' I told him , if it 's not meant for me to keep on in show business , I 'll appreciate a sign , and if I get it , I 'll get out . If it is meant for me to stay in show business , I want to go all January 11 , 1959 the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shrine . " ' " Was there a sign ? " I asked . He said , in the voice of a man ashamed , " 1 forgot about my deal with Saint Jude for a while . It was the beginning of summer . My wife , our little daughter , Margaret , and I went on a vacation trip to see my brother Ray in Toledo . I planned to spend a couple of weeks there , but suddenly , for no reason , I said to my wife , ' I think I 'll run into Chicago to look around . There 's a lot of good radio work in Chicago , and radio actors there do well , living in the suburbs and all . Why do n't I get out of the saloon entertainment business and go back into radio ? ' My wife said , ' All right , if that 's the way you want it . ' " My going to Chicago was where Saint Jude got in his first licks . That was the hinge in my life . Everything since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio and got a job . I 'd done dialect stuff in night clubs . I not only spoke different dialects , I spoke different languages  --  Italian , Yiddish , Arabic , Greek  --  and that stood me in good stead . 1 began working around Chicago radio stations the second week of July , 1940 , and on the twelfth day of August I took a job in the Fifty-one Hundred Club on Chicago 's north side . Supposedly that job was for one week , at fifty bucks . I 'd been working in radio under my real name , Amos Jacobs  --  Amos was my middle name  --  but when the man at the Fifty-one Hundred Club asked me , ' What 's your name ? ' I said , ' Danny Thomas . ' I was n't happy about the crummy appearance of the joint as it was then , and 1 did n't give my right name for fear that my friends in Detroit would think I was working in a honky-tonk .

I stayed with that one-week job three years . " " How much were you getting when you quit ? " I asked him . " Five hundred a week , " he told me . " It was then that Abe Lastfogel , head of the William Morris Agency , took over my career . I 'd been booked by the Chicago office of the William Morris Agency , but I was about to drop the agency on the ground that I did n't need a representative any more . I planned to go in business with Mr. Roscoe , who owned the Fifty-one Hundred Club . Mr. Lastfogel happened to be in Chicago and he came out to the club and caught my act . Hearing he was in the audience , I did my best . It also helped that I had reached a point with my regular audience where I could do no wrong . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

' " ' I want to be an entertainer , ' I told him , ' but it looks as if being a saloonkeeper is the best bet for me .

But I nudged him at La Martinique because it was where the people laughed hardest . It had class , not high-society class , but it was n't a place you fell into off the sidewalk either . It cost about eighteen-seventy-five just to sit down . There was a three-seventy-five minimum . There was a five-dollar tip to the maitre d ' , and five to the captain and a further five to the waiter , so already your tab was eighteen-fifty .

The few New Yorkers present wondered what was going on . From the moment I walked on , the Chicagoans beat their palms to a pulp and yelled , ' Go , Danny , go ! ' " " Like at a football game ?

The sudden realization that Chicago , the city where something  --  I do n't know what  --  had persuaded me to try my luck , was Saint Jude Thaddaeus ' home in the United States knocked me out . To me , it meant only one thing : ' Build that shrine . You promised . This pamphlet is a reminder . ' " I went home and slept for a few hours . When I got up I told my wife I could n't go in business as a night-club partner . I 'd never be able to build the shrine that way . The money would n't be big enough . She called me a religious fanatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I love you , but this I owe . ' I had no idea what my shrine was going to be . A shrine can be almost anything . It can be a side altar in a church , it can be a statue , it can be an arbor in a vineyard . But while I did n't know it , my shrine was going to be a hospital in Memphis , Tennessee , dedicated to a search for cures for catastrophic diseases of children . But at that point there was no hospital , only me telling Saint Jude , ' I 'll build your shrine , but where do I go from here ? ' I got my answer a week later when Abe Lastfogel came to Chicago , caught my act and took me to New York . From that moment on , building Saint Jude 's shrine was always on my mind . " First I began to study Saint Jude 's life . There 's not much to know . He was one of the Twelve Apostles . He preached the Gospel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How did they kill him ? " 1 asked . " They clubbed him to death , " Danny told me . " That 's why he 's shown carrying a club in his hand . And there 's the flame of the Holy Spirit on his head , to show that he 's an Apostle . He was Christ 's cousin and he wears a medallion of Christon his chest to show his relationship to our Lord . " For a while during World War II , I went off to the E.T.O. with Marlene Dietrich to entertain the troops . After that I went to the South Pacific with my own theatrical company . Then in 1945 ( two years after I 'd left Chicago ) , I was booked into the Chcz Parec in that city at S3000 a week . I stayed there for seventeen weeks . That was the beginning of my big earnings . During that engagement , I hired a car and made a sentimental pilgrimage to the places I 'd haunted when I 'd lived in Chicago . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , and lighted a ten-cent candle before his white marble statue in memory of all the times I 'd done it in the past . I was certain that that statue was a statue of Saint Clement , because I recognized all of the other statues there , such as the Holy Family and Saint Theresa , whom 1 knew well . " It was one of the most awe-inspiring moments of my life . You 've heard the expression , ' My hair stood on end . ' Mine did . I walked into the church and to a little alcove where the statue stood . Then I looked at that statue closely and I said , ' You mean you 've been here all the time ? ' It was a statue of Saint Jude . It always had been a statue of Saint Jude , with the club in his hand , the medallion on his breast , and the flame of the Holy Ghost on his head , only I had n't known what those things meant before . " Right after that , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was his suggestion that I build a hospital for underprivileged children . I wanted to build it in the most forgotten , out-of-the-way place I could find , but the cardinal said ' No . ' There were transportation and hotel facilities to be considered and suppose a specialist was needed from Europe or the Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins or the Children 's Medical Center in Boston , how would such a specialist get to an out-of-the-way , hard-toreach hospital ? " " The cardinal was practical , " I said . " He had a cute punch line too , " Danny told me . " He pointed out that the University of Tennessee 's medical school is in Memphis , with one of the largest medical student bodies in America ; and Memphis has fine hotels and good transportation . Then he smiled and said , ' Besides , it 's my home state . ' " " How much did you think it would cost ? " 1 asked . " At first , " he said , " I figured on a clinic costing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I advanced into the general-hospital field , it began to run higher , and when I finally decided upon a research hospital , it ran higher still . " " How much will it cost when it 's finished ? " I asked . " Two million , " he told me . " We 're still half a million short . The big remaining task is maintenance . When my peo. plc , the Arabic-speaking people of America , selected me the Lebanese of the Century , I asked them , ' Why did you do it ? ' They said , ' Because you have been successful in theatrical business and because , although you 're a member of a minute minority , you 're not ashamed of your heritage . ' " I could n't understand why a fellow should get a trophy for that , so I said , ' I want to earn this trophy . Only when I 've done that will I put it in my trophy room , not before . ' Then I asked myself , How 'll I earn it ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dope . They 've been in America a hundred years : they have many clubs and each has contributed to every nationally known charity , but they 've never done anything together . " " They seem to have an even harder time getting together in Lebanon , " I said . " Do n't they ? " Danny agreed . " That 's where A.L.S.A.C. comes in . Originally it meant **38;1197;TOOLONG Charities . This has now been changed to embrace all of the Arabic . speaking people in the United States  --  Christians , Moslems , and Jews . I was told that for many reasons  --  all of them petty  --  this could n't be done ; yet now my people are united in a common endeavor . " November 2 , 1958 , was the groundbreaking day for the Saint Jude Hospital . For that event , Catholic , Jewish and Protestant clergymen assembled a shovel which had been made in three parts . " They handed it to me , " Danny said , " and I dug up the first spadeful of dirt . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Headded proudly , " That is mine . "
