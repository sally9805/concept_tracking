txt Kings Saud of Saudi Arabia and Faisal of Iraq issued a joint communiqu ? tonight declaring that no Arab country should interfere in the affairs of another Arab state . This was intended as a rebuke to President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt , whose propaganda machinery has been turned against Jordan , Iraq and Lebanon . It was also an unmistakable warning to President Nasser 's diplomatic missions . Two weeks ago the Saudi Arabian monarch had demanded the recall of the Egyptian military attach ? in Riyadh . Earlier today , Premier Nuri as-Said made an impassioned defense of his foreign and domestic policies . Premier Assails Neutralism In an interview with foreign newsmen , the Premier of the only Arab state linked to the Western defense system through the Baghdad Pact assailed neutralism . He warned the other Arab nations that the Soviet Union would continue to " create disturbances " in the Middle East . The monarchs ' communiqu ? , which was broadcast simultaneously here and in the Saudi Arabian capital , Riyadh , followed a six-day visit to Iraq by King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . The communique pledged both kingdoms to " make every effort possible " to prevent Israeli shipping from using the Gulf of Aqaba . The Israeli port of Elath is at the head of the gulf . The Kings described the waterway as " a closed Arab gulf " connecting part of the Moslem world with sacred Islamic places . The monarchs of two of the world 's biggest oil producers pledged every possible effort to prevent oil supplies from reaching Israel from any Moslem source . They labeled Zionism , communism and imperialism ' as triple threats to the Arab world and agreed to resist with all their might these " dangers that threaten Arab stability , independence and power . " ' . As expected , however , there was no direct reference to the Jordanian crisis . Although King Saud agrees with the Iraqis that King Hussein 's regime is menaced by subversion from Egypt and Syria , he wants no break with Egypt and Syria . He is said to believe that President Nasser can still be won back to moderation . The two Kings agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moslem world . They espoused the principles of the I Arab League 's Arab security pact , of the United Nations and of the Bandung conference of Asian-African nations held in Indonesia in 1955 . Referring to Palestine , the I communiqu ? said the return of ; Arab refugees to their homes ! was an essential condition to the restoration of peace and security in the Middle East . The Kings also disapproved French " methods of force " in Algeria and promised continued support to the Algerians in their struggle for independence . Premier Cites Choices Expanding at his news conference on his criticism of neutralism , Premier as-Said insisted that the Arab world had only two choices  --  to ally with the West or to ally with Moscow . He observed that the Western powers , with all their mistakes , had nevertheless given independence to colonial peoples but that Moscow had kept a tight rein on its satellites . The Premier said he would maintain martial law in Iraq as long as Communist agents remained active in Syria and Jordan . He indicated that any steps toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nasser . The Egyptian leader could make a start by halting propaganda against Iraq , Mr. asSaid observed . He noted , however , that Cairo 's attacks on his administration had eased off in the last two months . Despite the strained relations With President Nasser , Iraq firmly supports Egypt in denying the passage of Israeli ships through the Suez Canal , the Premier ? asserted . Israel , he said , must first do something for the refugees before she can expect concessions from the Arab world . Moreover , he continued , any inconvenience suffered by Israel through a Suez blockade is negligible compared with the misery of nearly a million Palestinian Arabs who lost their homes when the state of Israel was created . " How many ships do the Jews have ? " the Premier asked angrily . " Their merchant fleet is small . Closing the Suez Canal to these ships is not serious . What is serious is the plight of a million refugees . " Definitely we support Egypt on this issue . " On the subject of internal security , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail  --  reporters had beer told there were 8.000 to 20,000 political prison ers ? by declaring that only forty-nine such persons were now being detained . Of these , he said , forty-three were in a concentration camp and five were awaiting trial . " That concentration camp is not at all like Hitler 's , " he added . Those in concentration camp Bre " suspected of being a Communist element , but we want to release them soon , " the Premier declared . Mr. as-Said denied a charge made to foreign correspondents Tuesday by an Opposition leader that the elections of 1954 and the referendum of 1955 were rigged . Both resulted in overwhelming victories for the Premier . " The Opposition put up only twenty-two candidates for Parliament that would have 140 , elected deputies , " the Premier said . At 68 , Mr. as-Said looked cheerful and fit . But when asked f he would seek re-election next rear , he spread his hands and said : " I do n't know whether I 'll run gain . I 'm an old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
