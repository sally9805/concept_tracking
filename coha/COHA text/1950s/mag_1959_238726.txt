Financier Allan P. Kirby , boss of Alleghany Corp . since the death of Robert R. Young almost two years ago , got a telephone call last week from another big moneyman . The caller : Boston 's Abraham M. Sonnabend , the real estate wheeler-dealer who heads Hotel Corp . of America , Botany Industries , and a fistful of other companies . Could they set up a meeting some time later in the week ? Kirby knew why . For months , Sonnabend and a group of associates had been quietly buying Alleghany stock , and they owned some 700,000 shares , or about 14% of the common stock outstanding . They obviously wanted to get in . Alleghany , said the Boston financier , was " an excellent investment opportunity . " <P> It was all of that . Through its stock holdings , Alleghany has 17% working control of the New York Central Railroad , plus 50% ownership of the Missouri Pacific Railroad . The Central also owns more than $500 million in Manhattan real estate , including the Park Lane , Commodore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue land . Biggest plum of all : Alleghany 's 47.8% control of Investors Diversified Services , which manages five mutual funds whose combined assets total about $3 billion . This great Alleghany complex , says Sonnabend , " has been static since Robert Young died . It needs new vitality and dynamism . " <P> <P> " Bad Faith . " The meeting between Kirby and Sonnabend went well enough . Kirby offered Sonnabend a seat on Alleghany 's nine-man board ; Sonnabend said he would accept . But hardly had the two parted when the deal exploded . Angry telegrams flew back and forth , and words began to fly about a proxy fight for control of Alleghany at the annual meeting next May . <P> What touched off the fight was some behind-the-scenes maneuvering by Alleghany 's Executive Vice President David Wallace , 35 , who also acts as trustee to Bob Young 's estate and adviser to his widow . Wallace had advised Mrs. Young to support any future Sonnabend bid for control . When Kirby got wind of this piece of advice , the executive committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bad faith . A violation of a gentleman 's agreement to keep Wallace . I decline to serve on the board as presently constituted . " <P> <P> The Key . At week 's end , Alleghany Chairman Kirby was trying to make up his mind whether to fight to keep control or not . He owns 524,000 shares of Alleghany common , about 10% , also holds 148,000 shares of 6% convertible preferred and warrants for another 226,440 shares of common . If he converts his preferred and exercises his warrants , he will have close to 1,450,000 shares of common to Sonnabend 's 700,000 shares-and the common elects five of the nine directors .
