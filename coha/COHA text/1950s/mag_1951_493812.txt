THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT H. by R. H aeum of December , 1917 . We regard it as one of the finest statements of the liberal spirit ever published . We reprint it this Christmas because each phrase and thought and its entire spirit seem to us clearly relevant in today 's struggle . Britain was at the height of her material and military power when this protest and appeal was written . Victory in war was : only a matter of time . But , turning from these surfaie advances to the underlying deterioration of Britain 's siitrit , Tawney , the liberal historian , rightly dis ? cerned that a ' state of mind was hardening among the allies which would perpetuate the unending cycle of victory , disillusionment and future wars . . . . The most obvious temper of war is a passion for effective action . But the very concentration of effort upon action disturbs a clear apprehension of the prin ? ciples which give action its significance , and which alone make the wars of nations something either nobler or baser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which men see is that their material forces should be weaker than those of their opponents . They organize , and sweat , and die , that they may avert it . By incredible exertions they hold the means of military victory in their hands . " At last , " they say , " we are neither out-num ? bered , nor out-generaled , nor out-gunned . Victory . is in sight . " And victory eludes them ; or , if it seems to be in sight , it is not the victory which they willed in the hour of vision which preceded the whirlwind of feverish activity . Too often it is not only not the same : it is the opposite . The destruction , by the effort to achieve victory , of the moral principles which alone can justify a war , is the commonest lesson of history . It is the defeat which men prepare for themselves , as the danger of defeat by the enemy becomes more remote . The change in their temper is not understood by them ; or none , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It comes disguised as patriotism , self-sacrifice , a more perfect and unquestioning devotion .. . . Men . . . can not see the distant heights they saw before the struggle began ; and because they can not see them they believe that they no longer exist , and turn angrily on those who remind them that the foundations of the world are what they were . In their obliviousness of all that does not directly forward their success , they imperil the success for which they strive by forgetting in what it consists . The spirit of theircause works for them , and offers them the greatest demonstration of its power that the world has seen for a century . Like men who curse every wind that does not fill their own sails , they turn from it with a sneer of impatience , because it can not be made of immediate military advantage ; and since they will not let it work for them , it ends by working against them . As the original mean ? ing of their effort grows faint , new interpretations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulness . Like Bunyan in his anguish , they are surrounded by voices clamoring : " Sell it ! Sell it ! Sell it for security . Sell it for empire . Sell it for economic advantage . Sell it for revenge . " But , unlike Bunyan , they do not know the fiend for what he is . And since , being human , they can not live without a creed , the loyalty which was given to the cause for which the War was undertaken is transferred to the War itself . It be ? comes an article of faith , whose character and objects it is heresy to question . The inertia , the apathy , the weight of custom and routine , which made it difficult to begin , make it hardly less difficult to contemplate its being ended , and in proportion as the soldiers grow more pacific , the civilians grow more bellicose . Peace itself is no longer thought of as the reconciliation of enemies through the victory of a principle . It is the last trick to be snatched by the winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerance , the generosity which would feel that the nation were contaminated if it snatched material advantages from the world 's misery , the liberal spirit which knows that even among its enemies there is a better mind , and preserves through the conflict the hope of reconciliation , are denounced as treason to those who have fallen , though it was in the hope of some such glorious resurrection that they fell . In so far as it yields to that spirit , the world staggers blindly to hell along a path paved with the corpses of men who offered their lives for its salvation . . Of all the dangers that confront a nation at war , this degeneration of national purpose , so common in the past as to seem part of human nature itself , is the greatest . It impedes its success , and would degrade it if it were attained . But , if they will , men can escape it . And the way to escape it is for them to keep their moral forces alive and active , by perpetually reflecting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of peace which , not in ' the heat of the conflict , but in the calmer mood which preceded it , they desired to establish . It is to refuse to be frightened by national danger into na ? tional egotism , and to judge all proposals and policies , not by the immediate advantages which they may seem to offer to this nation or that , but by their compatibility with the original purpose , which may not have been the only motive , but was nevertheless the moral justification , for undertaking war . In order to secure itself against the solicitations which distract it from its main goal a nation ought periodically to redefine its object . Like believers in a world of scoffers , it ought solemnly to ' rehearse the articles of its faith . Such a redefinition is the most urgent need of Great Britain at the present stage in the War . It is necessary , not because the national purpose has changed , but in order to convince the nation and its allies that it has not . The strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of detachment from purely national ambitions , which seemed to some baser minds its weakness , and which , therefore , they have tried to expel . It was deriVed less from astute diplomacy than from its con ? formity with the deeper forces which , since the French Revolution , have been at work ? with many cross-currents and backwashes , with many obstacles , which England as well as Germany has helped to erect ? for national freedom , and for a growth of international solidarity based upon law . The qualities which made Great Britain slow to mobilize its military resources were also those which gave it some small place in the confidence , even in the affection , of other nations . Its faults were obvious and childlike : its na ? f worship of material success , its contempt for reflection , its savage provincialism . But it appealed even to its critics because it seemed , if not to be disinterested ? for what nation is disinterested ? ? at least to acknowledge the existence in political affairs of a higher law than national self-interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its power of concentration . The strength of the allies has consisted in their power of expansion and attraction . No Cioubt some such concentration of purpose and organiza ? tion as Germany has practised for a generation is neces ? sary in France and England in time of war . But it is even more important to cultivate the appeal to the better mind of mankind which comes from the disinterested Advocacy of a principle . It speaks when the guns are silent . It fights with the armies . And when the armies Are dead , it fights on . Such was our strength ; and after three years of war we should have learned both our strength and our weak- Bess . But we have not learned them . Or , if we have , while we have supplemented our weakness , we have not ailtivated our strength . Indeed , in some ways we have impaired it , We have impaired . it , because we have allowed it to be overgrown by elements foreign to ' the original purpose of the nation , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , the English Government can not state " terms of peace . " It can not " act independently of its allies . " Of course it can not . Nor is it suggested that it should . What it can do is to state , after consulta ? tion with its allieS , the provisional terms upon which the Entente is prepared to begin the discussion of settle ? ment . It can distinguish between those items in the settlement which the allies are pledged to attain before they cease hostilities , and those items which they would desire to attain as the result of negotiations ? between the injustices perpetrated in the course of the War , which Germany must consent to undo before discussion is possible , and the wider reorganization of Europe which would have been desirable even had no war oc ? curred , and which war can not achieve . . . . To refuse to state the terms upon which the allies Would be willing to enter upon negotiations is to invite the suspicion that they do not state them because they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for what they can get , " because they do not aim at military victory in order to obtain conditions which are just , but will estimate the justice of different claims by the extent of the military victory which they succeed in obtaining . . . . " All this , " it will be replied , " is irrelevant . Our duty is to achieve victory . " Certainly it is our duty to achieve victory . It is because a more precise definition of our objects would contribute to victory that such a definition is indispensable . It is necessary , not in order that we may now make peace , but in order that we may more effectively make war , by waging it with our minds as well as with our bodies . If victory can not be achieved by policy alone , neither can it be achieved , as men built the Pyramids , by the unreflecting expenditure of physical energy and the sacrifice of countless human lives . If policy without power is lame , power without policy is blind . Since when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand everything from the courage of its soldiers , and nothing from the wisdom of its statesmen ? And in what , after all , does victory consist ? Are we at the age of picture-books , stage-struck with the vision of a Roman " triumph , " a procession of generals and minis ? ters to the Capitol with captives bound to their chariots ? What test of victory is there except the acceptance by the enemy of the terms which he is desired to accept ? .. . It may readily be conceded that there is not at present any evidence that the existing German Government would accept them . But that is a reason for stating provisional terms , not for declining to state them . .. . Either the allies would begin negotiations and end un fathomable misery , or they would make it evident beyond controversy that those who fall in the future . will fall to realize the objects which they approved when they took up , arms . It is not evident now . It is not evident to our allies , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our armies . We fight in an obscurity which makes the resolution of our adversaries more desperate because more despairing , and which weakens our own by obliterating the moral principles on which it formerly was based . Our prayer might be that of Ajax : " Let us fall in the light . " But it is addressed , not to the gods , but to the governments , which blind the nations with the fog which they create to conceal themselves . . . . To define at once and in explicit terms the conditions precedent to the commencement of negotiations is , there ? fore , the path of wisdom . It is also the path to the only kind of victory which it is wholesome for England to win or for Germany to endure . There is a moral as well as a military strategy . Its aim is to undermine the central fortress of an opponent 's resistance by appealing to principles which his government repudiates , but which his people may be willing to accept , because they are the foundation of popular liberty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally in the heart of its enemy , whom it may alienate by menaces , or strengthen by the recognition of the common interests of common humanity . What our statesmen seem to have forgotten is that the Allies are not fighting Germany , as nations have fought in the past merely for territory or for corn merce . They can not , it is true , escape from the influence of these things . But it is not by them alone that the special quality of this war can be explained . They are fighting to resist the extension by force of a more than usually immoral political system , to which , if it had been successful , the world , with its reverence for demonstrable achievements and for the triumphant fact , would prob ? ably have tended to conform ... " Therefore it is unnecessary , " said the writer of a little book which made some stir in the world 400 years ago , " for a Prince to have all the good qualities which I have enumerated . But it is very necessary to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , humane , religious , upright , and to be so , but with a mind so framed , that , should you require not to be so , you may be able and know how to change to the opposite . " " To change to the opposite , " there it . is ! Who , in. the agony of the past three years , has not felt within himself and his countrymen the beginning of that change ? Who has not excused it by the thought of the peril of his nation and of the abominations of its enemies ? And yet who , if he will expel from his mind the passion which war arouses , not in the actual combatants , but in its spectators , would not admit that the motive which justifies this war was not national interest , but a principle ; that its object is the defeat , not merely of Prussia , but of the Prussian spirit ? not merely national security , but a better order of inter ? national relations ; and that it is only upon the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be built ? Either a war is a crusade , or it is a crime ; there is no halfway house . . .
