Election time was 16 long months away , but Republicans as well as Democrats were already beginning to hear the call . Across the nation , in surprising numbers , Republicans were cheerfully spending $100 bills for a platter of chicken and a hard seat at a fund-raising dinner . The California party overflowed Los Angeles ' Biltmore Bowl and took in $130,000 . At Milwaukee a fortnight ago , the Wisconsin G.O.P. $100-a-plate affair , featuring Senator Robert A. Taft as speaker , drew 2,250 enthusiastic listeners . More dinners were on the way . <P> Almost all G.O.P. professionals seemed convinced that their opponent in 1952 would be Harry Truman , and with such campaign items as mink coats , Korean casualties and home freezers , many talked confidently of being able to take good care of Harry this time . <P> Dark Horse . Busiest of all were the backers of Ohio 's Taft . They flitted back from sorties into the countryside with broad grins and reports that scores of delegates ( " So many that it is almost frightening , " said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in no hurry to line up delegates , remembering that Taft had been a winter-book favorite in 1940 , ' 44 and ' 48 , without ever being able to get to the post . They feared one dark horse : Ike Eisenhower . <P> The We-Want-Ike faction was hard at work . Such shrewd politicos as Pennsylvania 's James Duff , Kansas ' Frank Carlson and Harry Darby were saying openly that Eisenhower would definitely run-and as a Republican , not a Democrat . A wealthy New Jersey lawyer named Amos J. Peaslee , who backed Harold Stassen in 1948 , was rounding up a group of influential Republicans to talk up Stassen again as a candidate . <P> Top , but a Drop . In the latest Gallup poll , Eisenhower was still everybody 's favorite-Republicans ( 30% ) , Democrats ( 40% ) and independents ( 35% ) . Harry Truman 's popularity was at a new recorded low ( only 24% approved of his handling of the presidency , said Gallup ) . Actually Eisenhower had dropped about 8% in popularity among the Republicans , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained . What Ike lost was divided up between New York 's Governor Thomas E. Dewey ( 16% ) , who announced last fall without qualification that he was an Ike man ; Stassen ( 10% ) , who says he is also for the general ; and California 's Earl Warren ( 13% ) who is n't saying . <P> Way down on the list , among the batch of possibilities which Gallup called " Others , " was presumably Douglas MacArthur , who said he was n't interested . The pros seemed to consider him more valuable as an issue than as a candidate . But he worried the Eisenhower backers on another score . They hoped that MacArthur would not take it into his head to come out against the candidacy of his onetime aide .
