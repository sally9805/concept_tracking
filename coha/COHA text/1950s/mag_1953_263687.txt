Of the 29 bureau chiefs who direct the on-the-spot operations of TIME 'S domestic and foreign news staffs , the most recently appointed is Robert W. Glasgow , a correspondent in TIME 'S Chicago office for the past three years , and now head of our Toronto news bureau . Shortly before Glasgow took over his new Canadian post , he dropped by TIME 'S New York office . In the course of our conversation we talked about some of the things that go into the making of a newsman . <P> The career of Bill Glasgow , reporter , a native of Warren , Ark. , began at Hendrix College , Conway , Ark . As he recalls it : " I 'm still baffled at what prompted me to get into this business , although I well remember when it happened . It was one day in the fall of 1933 . The editor of the college paper issued a call for reporter candidates . Though I had never shown any interest in news beyond reading it , I suddenly found myself applying and being told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit samples of my work . I had no samples , so there was only one thing to do : go out and write a story . <P> " That first story subsequently proved to have been an important one , though it was not particularly well written and certainly not original . It was one of those things about ' If all the biscuits eaten since the dining hall was built were stacked on top of each other , they would reach . . . ' I do n't recall how far they would reach , but I do know it was a stratospheric height . Anyway , the editor published it , and I 've been writing ever since . " <P> Two years after the biscuit story , Glasgow was working as editor of the Warren Eagle-Democrat at a time when the community was going through " an explosive , hectic time , caught squarely in the painful throes of a union effort to organize the local lumber mills . " Says he : " I learned rather quickly that reporting is a bit more complicated and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on other Arkansas papers , Glasgow joined the New York Herald Tribune as a general assignment reporter , soon became its labor reporter working out of New York . Following a wartime hitch in the Merchant Marine , he returned to his old beat in time to cover the wave of labor troubles and strikes that swept the country in the year following V-J day . In 1947 Glasgow went to Harvard on a Nieman fellowship to study industrial and human relations . " It was , " he says , " a reporter 's dream , the opportunity to study the background of some of the contemporary history I had been covering . " <P> After Harvard , the Tribune sent Glasgow to Chicago as its Midwest correspondent . He came to TIME in 1950 , assigned to the Chicago bureau . Some of the TIME stories he covered include the Cicero race riots of 1951 , the tragic West Frankfort , Ill coal mine disaster , the rise of Adlai Stevenson and his political campaign , some notably quotable reporting on the home life of Dr. Alfred Kinsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
