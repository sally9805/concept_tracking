THE WOMEN 'S ARMY CORPS ( 841 pp. ) - Lieut . Colonel Mattie E. Treadwell-The Department ot the Army ( $6.25 ) . <P> Before Pallas Athene sprang full-armored from his brow , Zeus had a dreadful headache . The U.S. Army had worse headaches getting the Women 's Army Auxiliary Corps , which adopted Pallas Athene as its symbol , dressed and going . But it was worth it . <P> How the WAAC ( later the WAC ) fought to make a place for itself , how it verged on humiliating failure and how success finally came , is told with bold candor and fine humor in the Army 's official history of the corps . <P> Symbol of Virtue . The person most responsible for the WAAC was Army Chief of Staff George Marshall , one of whose staff officers recalled : " General Marshall shook his finger at me and said , T want a women 's corps right away and I do n't want any excuses ! ' " The bill creating the WAAC was passed by Congressmen May 14 , 1942 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the humiliation ! What has become of the manhood of America ? " ) . Mrs. Oveta Gulp Hobby , a Houston publisher , was sworn in as WAAC director . Notes the book : " Her wide-brimmed hat proved unreasonably difficult to photograph . " <P> Mrs. Hobby had headed the WAAC 's preliminary planning program , which included the unhappy task of designing a corps uniform . The members of her staff , says the history , " faithfully wore sample undergarments while carrying on preplanning ; male planners offered their best guesses in the matter , and the staff became accustomed , as one member noted , to ' seeing Lieut . F. stalk through the office with a cigar in one hand and a pair of pink panties in the other . ' " The heraldic section of the Quartermaster General 's office submitted designs for insignia . A first attempt " produced only a busy-bee-like insect , which Mrs. Hobby pronounced a bug , adding that she had no desire to be called the queen bee . Designers then hit upon the idea of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive variety of womanly virtues and no vices either womanly or godlike. " * <P> At last the first class of WAACs gathered at Fort Des Moines , Iowa . " More was learned about women 's uniforms than had been discovered in the past six months of research . . . When WAACs walked or marched , the skirts climbed well above the knee unless a desperate grip on the skirt was substituted for the required arm swing . Shrieks of dismay arose as the women tried on the WAAC caps , uncharitably christened ' Hobby hats . ' " It soon became apparent that the WAAC difficulties were far more serious than had at first been thought . Items : <P> A vicious slander campaign threatened the existence of the WAAC , reaching its climax when New York Daily News Columnist John O'Donnell wrote ( falsely ) that WAACs were being issued contraceptives because " Mrs. Roosevelt wants all the young ladies to have the same overseas rights as their brothers and fathers . " <P> With a premature attempt to expand the WAAC organization , physical and moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women passed the physical examination for admittance .
