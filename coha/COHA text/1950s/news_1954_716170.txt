txt The old International Longshoremen 's Association , already under heavy attack , suffered yesr terday what may be its most damaging blow of all . Arthur Leff , a National Labor Relations Board examiner , recommended that the union representation election held among longshoremen in the Port of New York last December be set aside . His reason was that I. L. A. supporters had engaged in acts of force , violence and intimidation , including beatings and stabbings . To determine which union  --  the I. L. A. or the rival American Federation of Labor pier union ? should bargain for the port 's 24,000 dock workers , Mr. Leff urged that a new vote be taken as soon as possible . ' His suggestions must still be approved by the full labor board but the expectation was that this was a matter of course and that N. L. R. B. procedures would be expedited so that a new election might ' be held no later than the middle of next month . Mr. Leff 's report came as New York 's wildcat pier strike entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of Local 333 of the I. L. A. , made good in part their promise to respect picket limes setup by the parent dock union . Tugboat Men Begin Walkout The sympathy walkout by the towboat men got started slowly but both labor and industry sources expected that it would gain momentum so that by Monday that phase of the port 's troubles would be completely effective . However , harbor craft that move food , oil , coal and building materials will continue to operate . These were the day 's other waterfront developments : 9The slow but steady return to work continued . The Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor said 3,871 men were on the job , loading and unloading thirty ships . On Thursday the totals had been 3,712 men and thirty-five ships . 9Governor Dewey made an unannounced trip to New York from Albany . He was said to be here on waterfront matters . 9Longshoremen in Baltimore , where the port has been booming , announced they would work no more cargo diverted from New York . The move was out of sympathy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repercussions of the Leff report appeared to be a move by some L. A. officials to organize a " protest parade " in Washington Monday by 600 longshoremen . The New York police were notified by the Washington police that such a plan was afoot . Capt . William V. Bradley , the I. L. A. president , said early today he " understood " a parade was being contemplated . 9The New York Shipping Association , representing 170 shipContinued ping and stevedoring companies ; said it was formulating a threepronged legal attack against the I. L. A. The actions contemplated are : 1 . An appeal to Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr . to obtain another Taft-Hartley eighty-day injunction , banning the strike . The first such injunction expired on Christmas Eve . 2 . Applications in the New York and New Jersey Supreme - Courts for injunctions against mass picketing by the L L. A. 3 . Filing of a new unfair labor practice charge against the I. L. A. 's tugboat division , Local 333 , for its sympathy walkout in support of the parent union . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to President Eisenhower asking for " extraordinary remedial action " by the Federal Government to " end the extraordinary dispute situation . " 9The New York Board of Trade urged Mayor Wagner to consider the issuance of. , , " any necessary directive that would result in the actual arrest of persons engaged in violence " on the waterfront . In the December representation election held by the N. L. R. B. the old I. L. A. received 1,492 votes more than the A F. L. But 4,399 other ballots were challenged and never counted . It now appears that they never will be . The I. L. A. has contended that it legitimately won the contest and its present strike is aimed at forcing the board to certify it as bargaining agent . L L. A. Accuses Governor These were the reactions yesterday to Mr. Leff 's recommenda-tions : Patrick J. ( Packy ) Connolly , executive vice president of the I. L. A. , said : " Our only comment is political pressure is being , used . They 've got orders from Governor Dewey . If any honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing on charges against the I. L. A. it would decide in our favor . They did n't even count the vote . They 're afraid to count it . " Captain Bradley backed the Connolly comment and reiterated that his men would not return to work without a contract . Ace M. Keeney , executive director of the A. F. L. dock union , said : " We do n't see how the trial examiner could have done otherwise in view of the overwhelming evidence submitted by the A. F. L. Mayor Wagner said he was " gratified " that Mr. Leff harr " finally submitted his report so that prompt action can be taken . " But he added that he was " disappointed " that President Eisenhower " did n't take a more active ' role . " Mr. Wagner last Wednesday asked for Presidential intervention . Governor Dewey said : " This ? is a great victory in the three-year-long fight of the state Administration to drive the gangsters out of the New York waterfront . The time has come for everyone in the Government of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and be , counted on the side of decency with no more pussyfooting . " From now on anyone who claims to be neutral is playing the game of the racketeers . This will now apply with special emphasis to the employers on the waterfront who have not yet extended their full cooperation to the clean-up . " The N. L. R. B. said it would hold oral hearings on Mr. Leff 's report next Tuesday in Washington at 2 P. M. That will also be the deadline for filing exceptions to the recommendations , which were mailed out to the parties on Thursday . A recommendation from the full board is expected by the end of next week , with the setting of a new election date to follow soon thereafter . The tugboat sympathy walkout , which was voted on Thursday , had its most apparent effect on the berthing and departure of giant ocean liners . However , the Home Line cruise ship Nassau , carrying 425 passengers docked at Pier 42 , Hudson River  --  an A. F. L. stronghold  --  at 9:30 A. M. with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure of the Cunard liner Franconia from Pier 90 was delayed when tugboats refused to work her . She got off unassisted at lb P. M. The Nieuw Amsterdam , berthed at Jersey City , managed to get away from her pier without the help of a tug at 4 P. M. Then , strangely enough , she was picked up by two tugs and steered down-river , In Washington , Presidential Press Secretary James C. Hagerty said the White House had not changed its position that it should not intervene while the courts were involved in the waterfront situation . He added that Mayor Wagner 's telegram asking Presidential intervention had been referred to Secretary of Labor James Mitchell . Pier : violence was negligible . Three arbor workers  --  all A. F. L. members  --  were assaulted in early morning incidents . Two of them were injured in Brooklyn and one in Manhattan . The assailants Were unidentified . The wildcat walkout began on March 5 , one day after Federal Judge Edward J. Dimock had issued an order restraining the I. L. A. and eight of its locals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
