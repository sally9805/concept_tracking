Pr-1 " ln The Black Mollies A Story by Sloan Wilson Drawings by Rudi Lesser A T FOUR o'clock on a March afternoon Virginia Edwards telephoned her husband , Tom , at his office to tell him their four-year-old daughter 's cold had taken a turn for the worse . Virginia 's voice was serene as it always was , and she made light of the child 's illness . " The only reason I called is that Peg wants you to bring her a present , " she said . " The doctor says she has to stay in bed , and she 's bored . " " Has she got a fever ? " Tom asked . " Just a little one , " Virginia replied . " It 's under a hundred and two . " " How 's the baby ? " Tom asked . " He has n't caught it yet , " Virginia said . " Quit worrying ! " " I 'll be home as soon as I can , " Tom said . " Tell Peg I 'll bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the sales report he was writing , but he could n't concentrate . The foreboding that always gripped him when sickness approached was taking possession . Virginia never seemed to feel it . After half an hour of fruitless work , he gave up and went out to buy his daughter a present . On the way to a toy store he passed a place where tropical fish were sold . It occurred to him that a bowl of these would be a good diversion for a bed-bound child , and he went in . The tanks with the little fish glinting like sparks in the green water appealed to him , and before he got out the clerk had sold him a tank sixteen inches long , complete with a light to make the fish shine , a cardboard container full of water and fish , and a book on their care . On the train home he worried about his daughter . Long ago , when he was fourteen years old , his mother had died suddenly of pneumonia . That was before all the new miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off sickness he opened the book he had just bought , and was soon lost in an account of ways to maintain the balance of life in a fish tank . He liked the names of the fish described  --  the flame fins , the gold crescents , the neon tetras , and the black mollies . The only kind he knew he had bought was the black mollies . The clerk , while dipping out the brightly colored fish he had chosen , had persuaded him to buy the black mollies too . They were , according to the clerk , " a basic fish , " necessary for contrast . When the train reached his station , Tom gathered his packages and hurried home . His wife met him at the door . " How 's Peg ? " he asked . " Fine , " she said . " Good heavens , what have you got there ? " " Tropical fish , " he said , and without putting his packages down went upstairs to his daughter 's room . Peg was lying limply on her bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is that a present ? " she asked . " Sure it is , Baby , " he said , put the packages on the bedside table , and started unwrapping them . As the empty glass tank emerged Peg looked mystified . Virginia had followed Tom upstairs , and appeared with a pitcher of water . Tom fitted the light on the tank , turned it on , and Virginia poured in the water . " Watch now ! " Tom said to Peg . " I am ! - she replied . Tom loosened the cover on the cardboard container and like a magician poured its contents into the tank . A swarm of bright blue and crimson minnows with the black mollies among them like shadows blossomed under the light , swirled in a miniature cyclone , then slowly paraded around the glass walls . " Fish ! " Peg said , enchanted . She pressed her nose against the glass . Virginia and Tom stood watching her , grinning . In a few minutes Virginia left the room to put their eight-month-old son to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went downstairs for cocktails . While they were drinking they heard Peg coughing hard . " Has she been doing that all day ? " Tom asked . " A little , " Virginia said . " I 'll go up and see her . " She put her drink down and left . There was a long moment of silence broken only by Peg 's coughing before she reappeared . " How is she ? " Tom asked . " Still looking at the fish , " Virginia said . " Her temperature 's gone up a little , but you 'd expect that at night . " " What is it now ? " " A hundred and three . " " We better call the doctor , " Tom said . " He 's just been here , " Virginia objected . " Honestly , you must n't worry so , Tom ! We 're giving her aureomycin . She 's going to be all right . " Unwillingly Tom sat back and poured himself another drink . Virginia carried a tray of cereal and milk up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's asleep , " she said . " She 's way over on the side of the bed with her nose almost touching the tank , and she 's asleep . The fish were a good idea . " A FTER his dinner Tom tried to read , but he could n't get interested in his book . Leaving Virginia engrossed in a sweater she was knitting for Peg , he went to bed early . He was tired and slept so deeply he did n't hear Virginia come up . When hours later he was awakened by the strangling sound of hard coughing from his daughter 's room , he had no idea what time it was . The coughing awoke Virginia too . They went to Peg 's room . Peg had thrown off her covers , and waslying on her back . Her chest was heaving . Her lips seemed oddly purple . She was breathing faster than Tom had ever heard anyone breathe . He placed his hand on her forehead , and it seemed almost to burn him . Peg opened her eyes , coughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Call the doctor , " Tom told his wife . Virginia went downstairs to the telephone . " It 'll be all right , Baby , " he said to his daughter . Peg turned her head toward the fish tank and said , " It 's all dark . " He put the tank 's light on , and the fish shone . Peg lay watching them , with her chest straining . Virginia came back and said , " The doctor will be here in a few minutes . I guess we better get some clothes on . " When the pediatrician arrived he sat on the edge of Peg 's bed a long time listening to her chest with a stethoscope . He was the first physician Tom had ever had who was younger than himself . Peg lay watching him suspiciously , because usually when he came he had to use a needle to give her inoculations . Finally the doctor put his stethoscope in his bag and said , " I guess we better get her to the hospital . It sounds as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Got what ? " Tom asked . " Pneumonia , " the doctor replied . " It jumps up suddenly like this sometimes , but nowadays we can take care of it pretty well . It will be easier in the hospital . " Peg suddenly sat up in bed . She coughed hard . Weakened , she lay down again . Then she said , " Will somebody come to the hospital with me ? " " Of course , " Virginia said . " Daddy will take you . " Peg looked at her father . " Will you stay with me ? " she asked . " Of course I will , " he replied . " Can I take my fish with me ? " Tom thought of trying to carry her and the tank at the same time . " We 'll bring that along tomorrow , " he said . " I 'll stay with you tonight , and Mother will bring it in the morning when she can get a sitter to stay with the baby . " The doctor looked uneasy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom followed him . " You know , you 're right about staying with her , " the doctor said . " The psychiatrists and all those people say you should n't leave a child that age alone in the hospital . But the hospital is pretty crowded , and they do n't like parents hanging around . I think they 'll ask you to leave after you 've brought her . " Virginia heard the doctor talking to her husband , and joined them . They were standing right outside the baby 's room , and she was afraid they 'd wake him up . They all went down to the living room . Tom told her what the doctor had said . Virginia was usually so matter-of-fact about illness that Tom expected her to accept any hospital regulation without objection , and he was surprised when she said , " Why , Peg 's never been away from home before ! I would n't leave her with strangers now for anything ! " With renewed confidence Torn said to the doctor , " We wo n't leave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay ? " " I can try , " the doctor said , " but the hospital makes its own rules on these things , and you may have a fight on your hands . I 'll try to get you a private room . Meanwhile , give her another capsule of aureomycin and get her over there . You wo n't need an ambulance  --  she can lie down in the back seat of your car . " " We 'll call a taxi so Tom can sit in the back seat and hold her , " Virginia said . The doctor left , and Torn called a cab . They went upstairs and started getting Peg into her snow suit . Peg , who was independent for her age , had just learned to put on her snow suit herself , and she insisted on trying to do it now , but already she was weak , and could n't manage it . This , with the strangeness of going out so late at night , frightened her , and she began to cry . Virginia calmed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great adventure . By the time Virginia had got the snow suit on her , Peg was n't crying any more , but she had started to breathe seventy-two times a minute by the sweephand on Tom 's wrist watch , and he was frightened . He tried not to act as scared as he was . Finally , the taxi came . Leaving Virginia with the baby , Tom picked Peg up and , walking in the snow beside the sidewalk to avoid the icy surface , went out to it . The taxi driver jumped out to open the door , and they got in . I N THE back seat of the taxi the excitement of driving through the night seemed to revive Peg , and she insisted on sitting upin Tom 's lap . In spite of the trouble she was having breathing , she asked a great many questions about hospitals . The taxi driver apparently was intrigued by the drama of driving a child to the hospital and kept asking questions about Peg 's illness as though the child were n't there . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up some icy steps , down a long hall to a reception desk , where they consulted some instructions the doctor had telephoned and told Tom to place Peg in a wheel chair . A nurse appeared and started wheeling Peg off . Tom followed , walking beside the chair , and Peg grabbed his hand . They got into a strangely whining elevator and moved slowly upward . Finally they stopped . The elevator door rumbled open . it was the children 's floor . The first thing Tom heard was the sound of children crying . He glanced at Peg , and she looked startled . The nurse pushed her wheel chair out of the elevator , and another , older nurse came out of a small office to meet them . She ushered them down another long corridor . Even in the dim light Tom could see that nursery rhyme characters had been painted on the yellow walls . In the shadows the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe and Jack the Giant Killer looked more sinister than gay . Tom and Peg kept on going down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a room with an open door . Inside Tom could hear a child sobbing . " Here , " the nurse said . " I asked for a private room , " he said . " There are n't any left  --  did n't they tell you ? This is a semi-private . " The nurse started to pick Peg up , and with a movement of real fear she took hold of Tom 's arm . " I 'll take her , " he said , and lifted her from the wheel chair . Carrying her , he followed the nurse into the room , which was almost dark . In one corner , where the sobs were , he could just make out a small dim form in a crib . On the other side of the room , near a small night light , was an empty crib . Tom put Peg in it , but she still hung on to him . The nurse put a small pair of hospital pajamas on the bed and said , " Do you want me to change her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll have to let me take her temperature , " the nurse said . " Ca n't I do it ? " Tom asked . " I would n't be allowed to let you do that , " the nurse said . Tom held Peg while the nurse took her temperature . When it was over , he said to the nurse , " What is it ? " " I 'm sorry , but I 'm not allowed to tell  --  you 'll have to get that information from your doctor , " the nurse said . Tom put the pajamas on Peg and tucked her in . Her forehead felt hotter than ever , and she seemed to he breathing even faster . While he was bending down arranging her covers she whispered , " Do n't go away . " " I wo n't , " he said . T HE nurse turned up the light . She was carrying what looked like a large trans- parent shower curtain . Behind her an orderly wheeled a cylinder of oxygen as tall as himself . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought  --  he had n't seen one for a long time . He stood near the head of the bed while the nurse fussed with the steel frame , then fitted the transparent tent over it . Peg still wanted to hold his hand , but he could n't stand that near her withoutbothering the nurse . He guessed Peg realized that . She lay there without saying anything , but without taking her eyes off him . The nurse smoothed out the transparent tent so that it formed a rectangle enclosing Peg . While that was there , Torn thought , he would n't be able to touch her . The orderly wheeled the cylinder of oxygen against the wall nearest the crib , connected some rubber hoses , and turned a valve . There was a barely audible hiss . Torn watched Peg carefully . She still had her eyes on him , and her chest was rising and falling with that terrifying rapidity . The hiss of the oxygen continued , and gradually he saw that she was beginning to breathe easier . He grinned at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile back . Just before her eyes closed her lips moved , and although he could n't hear through the tent and over the sound of the other child sobbing , it was not hard to read her lips . She was saying , " Do n't go away . " Then she went to sleep . The nurse had gone out of the room , and Tom looked around for a place to sit . There were two chairs , one by each crib . Both were straight and hard . He selected one , and sat down . In a few minutes the nurse came back . " There 's no need for you to stay , " she said . " I 'd like to , " he replied . " I wo n't be any bother . " " She 's asleep , " the nurse said . " She might wake up , and she 'd like me to be here if she does . " His words suddenly seemed terribly familiar to him , and he remembered that his father had sat by his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness , and had said that whenever attempts were made to get him to bed . " How long do you plan to stay ? " the nurse asked . He had n't thought of it quite that way before . He had been planning to stay as long as Peg was in the hospital , but she might be there quite a few days , and there was only the hard chair . There was n't any place for Tom to lie down , or get meals , or even to wash up . " I think I 'll try to get a private room for her , where I can have a cot and stay , " he said . " There are n't any private rooms left for children  --  they 're used for contagious cases . Why do you want to stay ? " " I think you 'll find that the experts on child care recommend it , " he said , but his words sounded more pompous to him than sensible . They were both whispering hoarsely and it was hard to sound authoritative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confided as though she were telling a secret . " The visiting hours are from seven to eight in the evening . " Tom could imagine Peg lying there all day alone in those strange and terrifying surroundings with no understanding of why he and Virginia had abandoned her . " I 'm going to stay , " he tried to whisper sternly . " Let me stay until daytime , anyway . Then we 'll figure something out . " The nurse looked at him , shrugged , and went out . A few minutes later a bigger , higher-ranking nurse came in and whispered , " I 'm sorry , but you 'll have to leave . Rules . " " Sorry , " he whispered back . " Matter of principle . Let me stay until daytime , and we 'll figure something out . " " Why ? " she whispered with some exasperation . He explained all over again , but he felt as though he were confessing an odd religiousbelief . He thought he was going to be thrown out , and he whispered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look unpleasant , said , " All right , go ahead and stay while I 'm on duty . But you 'll have to take it up again with the next nurse . " T om settled back on his hard wooden chair and waited . The child in the crib across the room had gone to sleep at last , and there was nothing to be heard but the purr of the oxygen . After an hour of squirming on the chair it occurred to him that he would be much more comfortable on the floor . During the war he had often slept on floors . Now , however , he realized it would look odd to see a full-grown man who was already beginning to appear unshaven asleep on the floor by a crib in a hospital . He would be almost sure to get tossed out . He remained on the chair . Suddenly he heard Peg say loudly and clearly , " Daddy ? " " I 'm right here , Baby , " he said . There was a muffled sigh from inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him glad he had stayed . He experimented with positions on the hard chair and tried several extremely uncomfortable ones . After a long while it began to get light . The child in the other crib began to whimper again . He had felt somehow that he had no business going near the child in the other crib , but as the whimpers deepened into sobs it seemed unnatural to remain in his chair . He went over to the other crib . A little girl about the same age as Peg with hair as dark as Peg 's was light lay curled in a ball , her whole body trembling . Tom was not at ease with any children but his own , and he felt helpless . He knew he had no right to have anything to do with other people 's children in the hospital , but it was unbearable just to stand there while the child sobbed , and he went to the corridor to look for a nurse . The one he found was not the same one who had said he could stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked as soon as she saw him . She did n't look like the sort of person he could reason with , so he figured he 'd better bluff . In the corridor there he did n't have to whisper so carefully . " Never mind that , " he said sharply . " I have permission to stay with my daughter , who is in the room down the hall . I came to tell you that the child in the same room with her is crying pretty hard . You ought to see what 's the matter . " She did n't question him , and suddenly he realized that she was tired . Undoubtedly she had been working all night . " I 'll have a look , " she said . She followed him to the room . He had been afraid Peg might have awakened and be wondering where he was , but she continued to sleep . The dark-haired child was still crying . He and the nurse stood by her crib . " What is the matter , Baby ? " the nurse said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rhythm of the sobs and a tearful voice said , " I want my Mummy . " Then the sobs continued . The nurse sighed . " There 's nothing I can do with her , " she said . " They cry all day and all night up here . Nothing anybody can do . If you 're going to stay around here , you better just get used to it . " Tom was afraid she would go on to ask who gave him permission to stay , but she had other things on her mind and hurried off down the hall . He returned to his chair . At about seven o'clock Peg awoke . As soon as her eyes opened she said , " Daddy ? " " Here , " he said , feeling as though he were reporting at muster in the Army . p EG lay there , and he could tell she was becoming conscious of where she was , and the sobs from the other side of the room . She did n't say any more , and although she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't move , and she did n't look very well . Just when Tom thought she was going back to sleep , two nurses strode into the room , one carrying a tray with a hypodermic needle on it . They stepped briskly over to the crib in which the dark-haired child lay , and at that moment the dark-haired child let out a piercing scream . Peg sat bolt upright in her crib , and Tom involuntarily rose from his chair . The nurses were very matter-of-fact . One of them held the needle up to the light . " You know this does n't hurt , " she said . The other nurse reached for the child , who had shrunk into a corner of her crib , and pulled down the child 's pajamas . " No ! " the child said . Grimly , quickly , and without a word one nurse held the child firmly while the other plunged the needle in . Then she pulled theneedle out , the other nurse pulled up the child 's pajamas , and said , " There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further words of comfort to the child , they strode from the room . The child was crying in a way Tom had never heard a child cry . It was a cry not of pain , but of ululating fear . Tom started to go to the child . He had no sooner left his chair when the nurse who had administered the hypodermic came in with a technician pushing what looked like a white tea table , loaded with instruments . They went to Peg 's crib , and without so much as a glance at Tom , the nurse started peeling the tent off the frame . Peg immediately began to howl . The cries of the dark-haired child blended with Peg 's in a chorus of fear . " What are you going to do ? " Tom asked . " Temperature , " said the nurse . " After that , a blood test . " Torn held Peg while her temperature was taken , and this time he did n't even ask the nurse what the thermometer read . He could tell by feeling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for her arm , Peg retreated to the corner of her crib , but she submitted easily when Tom held her . Just before the nurse left she said to Tom , " You should n't be here . Visiting hours are from seven to eight in the evening . I 'll have to report you to the head nurse . " " All right , " he said wearily . By this time he had made up his mind that if the hospital wanted him to leave they would have to drag him out . Still , if there was going to be a big fuss it would n't help Peg or the other child much , and he was worried . The nurse had n't put Peg 's oxygen tent back , and he wondered if he should . Better not meddle any more than he had to , he thought . In a few moments he was glad he had n't , because the nurse returned with breakfast trays for the two children . The food smelled good , but of course there was no tray for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up , - and the nurse put the tray across her knees , gave the dark-haired girl her tray , and left the room . Peg took two mouthfuls and said , " Take it away , Daddy  --  I do n't want any . " " Are you sure ? " he said . She made a grimace of disgust , and he saw she wanted to lie down . He took the tray and put it on the bedside table . Peg lay down , and almost immediately went to sleep . Torn looked at the scrambled eggs . They looked pretty good . He took a few mouthfuls . It occurred to him that if the nurse came in it might look odd for him to be taking food from his sick child . He finished the eggs anyhow , and then it occurred to him that the nurse probably kept records of how each child was eating . Peg was n't eating at all , and the record should show it . He gazed guiltily at the empty plate . When the nurse came in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and said , ' =My daughter did n't seem to want any , so I ate it . It was pretty good ! " " I 'm glad you liked it , " said the nurse . She took the tray and started toward the door . Over her shoulder she said , " The nurse in charge of this floor is coming to ask you to leave . " " I 'll be glad to see her , " Tom said . H E PACED up and down the room . Peg was asleep , and the dark-haired child was whimpering softly . The pacing might bother her . He returned to the hard chair . There was nothing in the room to read . He sat for a while , and suddenly his wife , Virginia , walked in , carrying the tank of tropical fish . He had never been so glad to see anyone in his life . " How 's it going ? " she asked . " Fine , " he said , and helped her to set the tank down on the bedside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took a glass and started refilling the half-empty tank with water from a sink in the corner . He told her Peg seemed better , but that the hospital 's pressure to get him out was increasing . " If they really make an issue of it , I think I can scare them into letting us stay , " he said . " I 'll tell them I 'll make them carry me out , and that I 'll have every newspaper reporter I can get here to take pictures of it . " Virginia looked horrified . " I think we can do it easier than that , " she said . " I still know the woman in charge of recruiting nurses ' aids here  --  I helped her out for a while during the war . I called her up first thing this morning , and she said she 'd sign me up again . She warned me that if any of the nurses object to my staying with Peg , I 'll have to quit or go back to the regular nurses ' aid routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at me ! " She took off her coat , and Tom saw that she had on a white dress . Before he could sayanything an enormous nurse came in . She was taller than Toni , and must have weighed two hundred pounds . She had a big broad face which appeared kind in spite of an expression of determination . " Mr. Edwards , " she said , " the nurses have been telling me you wo n't leave . I understand how you feel , but you must realize we simply do n't have the facilities for this kind of thing . If you stay , all the parents will want to stay , and what would we do with them all ? " There was n't any answer to that , Tom thought , except maybe a rather futile speech about the kind of hospitals there ought to be . It would cost a lot of money to build hospitals with facilities for the parents of young children , and it would cost money to teach hospital personnel that the fears of both parents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guiltily he remembered that he had never helped the hospital to raise money . Still , he could n't forget how the hospital must seem to a four-year-old there alone . Virginia glanced at him , and suddenly he understood that the nurse had been talking entirely to him . She had n't paid any attention to Virginia . Very politely he said to the nurse , " I understand completely . I 'll go now . " The nurse looked relieved , and apparently afraid that he would change his mind , escorted him down the corridor . On the way to the elevator they chatted pleasantly . When Torn got home he found the sitter playing with the baby . The baby was sniffling ? apparently lie had gotten the cold which with Peg had developed into pneumonia . Almost as though she were there , Tom imagined Virginia saying , " Do n't worry ! " He grinned , and went up to bed . Six hours later he was awakened by the telephone . It was Virginia . She said the doctor had been there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also asked Tom to bring the fish food when he returned in the evening . " How are you making out ? " he asked . " They 've been pretty unpleasant , but think this shift of nurses will let me stay , " she said . " I 've spent half my time folding linen for them , but they still do n't like it . I do n't know how tough the next shift will be . " At five minutes of seven Tom returned to the hospital . He waited scrupulously until seven o'clock before presenting himself at the reception desk for a visitor 's card . A rather nice-Looking couple accompanied him in the elevator and walked ahead of him to the room where Peg was . They must be the parents of the dark-haired little girl . When Tom reached Peg 's room he found Peg was looking better . The dark-haired girl was in her crib , leaning toward the tank . When she saw her parents she drew back , expressionless . Her mother ran and picked her up . The child started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers undress . He turned to Virginia , who said that the attempts to get her out were growing more determined . When he glanced back at the dark-haired girl , her mother had placed her back in her crib , but still was leaning over and caressing her while the father rummaged in his pockets for presents . The child 's face was radiant . Her parents were obviously affectionate , and Tom wondered whether they knew what their daughter was going through . Virginia said she was willing to try to stick it out through the night , but Tom thought it was better for her to rest up for the next day , and insisted upon changing the guard . He told her that the sitter was anxious to get home and that the baby had caught the cold . " It was bound to happen , " Virginia said , kissed Peg good night , and left . A T EIGHT o'clock the parents of the dark-haired child departed , and the child started to cry again . The lights went out , and the only illumination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively replaced the night light . The water in the tank glowed like a crystal ball while the bright blue and crimson minnows with their drab shadows , the black mollies , tirelessly darted back and forth with obscure purposefulness . Peg and the dark-haired child , in spite of her sobs , lay watching them . Tom sat on the hard chair in the corner . In the dim light he could n't read the magazine he had brought . It seemed to him that the night ahead would be interminable . He had sat there only about ten minutes when a nurse came in and said , " Are you here again ? " The reply seemed self-evident , but he replied , " Yes , I wo n't be any bother . " " Come out in the hall , " she said . Their talking had already disturbed both children , and he did n't want it to continue . He went to the hall . " I have orders to get all parents out by eight o'clock , " the nurse said . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're more lenient . Your daughter is not an emergency case  --  she 's in no danger at all now . You 've got to go . " He thought quickly . Peg had been given a sleeping pill , and would probably go through until morning if she were n't awakened for injections or pills . If he made too big a fuss now , Virginia probably would n't be allowed to stay the next day , and it would he better for Peg to have company when she was awake than when asleep . He distrusted his own judgment because it was so uncomfortable for him to stay , but he said , " Let me talk to my daughter . I want to see how she 'll take it . " He went back to the room , and found Peg asleep . It seemed absurd to wake her to tell her he was going ; yet he did n't want her to awake and find him mysteriously gone . He hesitated , then went back to the nurse . " Do you think she 'll wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be all right , " the nurse said . " She 's no different from any other child . " While they talked he was conscious of the sobs of the dark-haired girl . Still , if Virginia could get back in the morning by the time Peg woke up , it might not be too bad . " If you do n't go I 'll have to call the manager of the hospital , " the nurse said . " If you 're going to bring your child here for treatment you 'll have to follow our rules . " " All right , I 'll go , " Tom said wearily . He wanted to tell the nurse that in spite of all her rules and all the hospital 's lack of facilities , a child 's first serious illness and first prolonged absence from its parents should not be made to coincide . His nerves were on edge , and he was afraid that if he got into an argument he 'd overdo it . The idea of Peg 's waking up alone and calling for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there by seven o'clock at the latest . He smoothed things over with the nurse as best he could and left . When he got home he saw that Virginia was shocked to see him . " Why did you leave ? " she asked . " She 's out of danger now , " he began , and with that beginning betrayed to himself the degree to which he had been driven by the dread in his own heart . For Virginia , concern for the dread in Peg 's had been enough . He faltered , then said , " She was asleep . The nurse really meant business this time , and I was afraid that if I made too much fuss it would be harder for you to get in tomorrow . She 's had a sleeping pill , and I think it will be all right if we get there by the time she wakes up in the morning . " w HEN they awoke the next day they found it had been snowing all night . Tom hurried to put the chains on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had fetched the sitter and got to the hospital . Tom sat in the waiting room while Virginia went up to the children 's floor . It was n't long before she reappeared . " I saw Peg , " she said . " Both she and the other little girl were crying when I came in . Peg is asking me to stay , and they tell me I ca n't . They say she 'll quiet down in time . " Tom looked stricken . " I never should have left her , " he said . " She ca n't have been crying long , " Virginia said . " I 'm sure she just woke up a little while ago . When they spoke to me I realized why you ' had to go last night . They did n't give me a chance . " " I 'll take care of this , " Tom said . " This hospital 's in the middle of a fund campaign , and they wo n't want any bad publicity . I 'll get some newspaper reporters here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an issue of this , I 'm all for it ! " " Wait a minute , Tom , " Virginia said . " Do n't make it harder for them to get funds . Call the doctor . Tell him what 's happened , and see what he says . " Tom went to a telephone booth and called the doctor . Trying to keep his voice calm , he outlined the situation . When he was through there was a pause . " Can you hear me ? " he said . " Yes , " the doctor said . " Look , I agree with you  --  scaring a child to death is a pretty poor way to make her better . But keep your shirt on . According to the last I 've heard , your daughter 's over the worst of it , and maybe you can take her home today if you can keep her in bed . " " Hell , we can get a nurse at home if we have to , " Tom said . " I 'll be right down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " If she 's at all improved , she can go home . " Tom rushed back to Virginia and told her the good news . In a few minutes the doctor arrived , told them to wait while he went up to look at Peg , and disappeared . " Peg knows him , " Virginia said . " She wo n't mind his looking at her very much . Sit down , Tom ! There 's nothing to worry about ! " Before long the doctor returned , grinning . " Go on up and get your daughter , " he said . On the way up in the elevator Virginia said , " Do n't be nasty to the nurses . It 's not their fault . " " I do n't feel like being nasty to anybody , " Tom said . They found Peg lying in her crib staring at the fish , whimpering and looking lost . When they told her they had come to take her home she looked as she did on Christmas morning . A nurse came in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom felt all the more badly about the little dark-haired child , who lay solemnly watching Peg get dressed . Tom said to Peg , " How would you like to leave the fish here for the other children ? " She hesitated , and he added , " I 'll get you some more . " It came hard , but Peg said , " Sure  --  they can have them . " " I 'm sorry , " the nurse said . " We ca n't allow it . They take so much time to care for and , besides , we 've had them before . The children get attached to them , and before long they die . It upsets the kids . " " All right , " Tom said . " We 'll take them with us . " They got Peg back into her snow suit , and in a wheel chair . Virginia emptied most of the water out of the fish tank , and carried that while Tom pushed the chair . When they got downstairs , Tom lifted Peg out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hospital open , and Tom carried Peg down the icy steps toward their car . Her body was warm in his arms . They hurried into the car and all sat in the front seat with the fish tank between Peg and Virginia . The fish in the trembling water at the bottom of the tank churned in a frenzy of terror , and Tom , restraining an impulse to honk the car 's horn in wild celebration , started driving home .
