txt AMERICAN ASKING ITS PILOTS TO PAY IN STRIKE THREAT Seeks $90,000 a Day Now and $850,000 Daily if the Union Halts Flights By A. H. RASKIN American Airlines wants unionized pilots to pay it $90 , - 000 a day in damages , even though a court order has kept the line 's planes flying in the face of a union strike threat , The company has asked Federal Judge Frederick van. ; Pelt Bryan to raise the damages to $850,000 a day if the Air Line Pilots Association actually halts operation of American 's fleet of 200 passenger and cargo planes . The unusual claim for reparations while flights continued came to light yesterday as Judge Bryan extended for least six more days his original , restraining order against walkout by the company 's 1,500 pilots . Deadline Set on Monday The extension provided assurance against any interrup- , tion of service before noon Monday on flights that carried 8,115,000 passengers a total of 5,142,000,000 revenue miles last year , The court set Monday as a deadline for the filing by company and union attorneys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One-third of the country 's commercial passenger planes remained grounded by strikes against Eastern Air Lines and Trans World Airlines . Eastern made a new contract proposal to its 550 striking flight engineers , but their union spurned the offer as " the same old song and dance . " A ! negotiating session in Miami ! between the line and representatives of its 5,383 idle mechanics proved equally fruitless , Hope at T. W. A. Brighter Hopes were brighter for a settlement of the strike of 6,700 T. W. A , mechanics . Leverett Edwards , chairman of the National Mediation Board , met with both sides in Kansas City in an effort to resolve a dispute over seniority rights for mechanics promoted to posts as foremen or supervisors . It was understood that the company and the International Association of Machinists were in basic agreement on a general wage increase of 41 cents an hour over a three-year period . This would be in line with a settlement reached last week by ground crews at National Airlines . However , minor problems affecting the adjustment of wage inequities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request by American for damages while the pilots stayed on the job was based on a con. tention that many passengers had decided to switch to other airlines or to railroads because of uncertainty about American 's // ability to ' continue fights . The company asked that the payrnents start as of Nov. 28 . This was the day after the union gave formal notice that its members plannca to quit work at 11:59 P. M. on Nov. 25 . Since then a series of extensions by Judge Bryan of an order he issued Nov , , 24 has kept the pilots from carrying out their ) strike threat . Charges Exchanged At a hearing before the judge yesterday American argued that it was entitled to a temporary injunction on the ground that the union had failed to engage in " realistic and effective " collective bargaining on wages and other contract issues . The union retorted with a charge that the company had been guilty of bad faith in the negotiations . After listening to presentations by Samuel G , Gates , counsel for American , and Henry Weiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the injunction plea pending submission of briefs and replies to briefs by both sides , He did not indicate how &quickly; he would rule after getlig the final papers Monday . In Miami , Eastern made one concession in the vain hope of obtaining a return to work by members of the Flight Engi-. ? neers International Association , Joseph H , Brock , the line 's vice president in charge of personnel , informed the union that the company would allow engineers to take training on company time at accredited aviation schools in preparation for licenses as pilots , This was in addition to previous offer that the company would pay for all such training . The offer was made even though Federal Judge Emmett C. Choate already has enjoined the engineers from striking over this issue , Jack Robertson , chief negotiator for the engineers , said the Eastern proposal had brought the walkout no closer to an end , He took exception to proposed wage increases and all other features of the company package , Lines unaffected by labor trouble were able to provide transportation for passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion or difficulty was reported , although many persons found it necessary to go to airports on a stand-by basis before being accommodated .
