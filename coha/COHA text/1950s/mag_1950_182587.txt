Pink-cheeked , blunt Richard C. Patterson Jr. , who had served three stormy years as U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia , looked forward to a quieter time when he took on his new diplomatic assignment to tree-shaded Guatemala City . That was 17 months ago . Last fortnight , weary and out of sorts , Patterson was back in Washington , and the Guatemalan government was asking for his recall on the ground that he had intervened in the nation 's domestic affairs. - The State Department insisted that Patterson had merely flown to the U.S. for a medical checkup . But as soon as the ambassador had taken off for Washington , a campaign against him broke out in the Guatemalan press . The semi-official Diario de la Maana labeled him an old-school imperialist . The Guatemalan Labor Federation 's leftist political action committee charged that Patterson had engaged in " a great imperialist conspiracy against the leaders of Guatemalan institutions . " The windy press charges seemed to sum up just about all Guatemala had to say against Patterson . Guatemala 's official protest , delivered verbally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cited no specific evidence . <P> Best guess was that Patterson had trod on the pink toes of President Juan Jose Arvalo 's " Spiritual Socialist " government by harping too strongly on the influence of Communists in Guatemala . No responsible observer has claimed that Arevalo 's government is run from Moscow . But some open Communist sympathizers ( the party itself is legally banned ) have risen to key positions in the labor movement , and have taken advantage of government support to badger U.S. companies . <P> Diplomat Patterson , a former RKO executive , thought he saw his duty clearly . " We are trying to work out here in Guatemala , " he later explained , " a pattern for containing Communism and injustice to U.S. companies everywhere . " But he never seemed to get the knack of dealing with touchy , prideful Latins . <P> Last month Arevalo apparently decided that he had had enough of Patterson 's direct talk . At about the same time that he asked for the ambassador 's recall , he posted extra guards at the residency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patterson against a threat to his life . A few days after that , the ambassador departed . <P> At week 's end , as Patterson was resting in the Bahamas , the State Department called in Dr. Carrera and roundly rejected his government 's protest . But whatever the diplomatic niceties of the situation , it seemed clear that Patterson and Guatemala were thoroughly fed up with each other ; if he ever went back it would probably be to pack his trunks .
