Brazil 's booming industrial center of So Paulo ( pop . 3,650,000 ) likes to boast of itself as the locomotive that pulls all the other Brazilian states . Ten years ago Industrialist Francisco ( " Cicillo " ) Matarazzo Sobrinho* decided it was high time So Paulo got up enough steam to become a center of the arts as well . Stoked by Matarazzo 's enthusiasm and backing , the city fathers and state officials financed a multimillion-dollar series of exhibition halls in the city 's suburbs , organized a biennial show of international art designed to rival Venice 's . Last week So Paulo opened its fifth Bienal , with more than 4,000 creations by 1,200 artists from 46 nations round the world . <P> But 46 nations did not produce 46 styles . In the brave new world of widely circulated reproductions , painters and sculptors are busier keeping abreast of trends than developing distinctive characteristics of their own . Overwhelmingly , the trend was abstract expressionist , in both painting and sculpture . Confronted by much that was grandiose , more that was trivial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own national museums , had to give up the search for jewels , settle on their choice among the semiprecious offerings available . <P> Almost by default , the grand prize ( worth $4,000 ) went to Britain 's Barbara Hepworth . Sculptress Hepworth , 56 , once had her studio near Henry Moore 's , and has stayed in his long , pierced shadow . Her smoothly involuted forms look like Moore 's women without the womanliness ; they are more like analytical geometry than like people . More powerful are the forged iron abstractions of Italy 's Francesco Somaini , at 33 a newcomer to the big time , who won the prize for the best foreign sculptor . Rough , inelegant for an Italian , Somaini produces work resembling meteorites and mountains , full of energy but at the same time monumental . <P> To the open annoyance of many jurists , first prize in painting went to Spain 's Modesto Cuixart , 33 , cousin but proclaimed rival of Spain 's Antonio Tapies ( TIME , March 16 ) . Cuixart makes elegant mudpies , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black may always be in fashion , especially in Spain . Yet the spirit of Goya is clearly not with Cuixart . He makes despair chic . <P> The U.S. painting and sculpture exhibits , financed by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts , featured Sculptor-Welder David <P> Smith and Abstract Expressionist Philip Guston . Both finished out of the big prize money . But as a whole , the exhibition proved that the modern , peculiarly American idiom of abstract expressionism has become the lingua franca of art the world over . Murky and only half articulate , it is nevertheless spoken everywhere . The idiom has plenty of champions , and may yet find its poet , too . <P> <P> *First cousin to So Paulo 's Multimillionaire Francisco ( " Chiquinho " ) Matarazzo Jr .
