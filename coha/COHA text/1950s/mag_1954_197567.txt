Last week , before the U.N . ' s Political Committee , the U.S. unrolled its blue prints for President Eisenhower 's " atoms for peace " plan . It involved , said U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. , the setting up of an International Atomic Energy Agency , which would be loosely linked to U.N . ( as are such agencies as UNESCO ) but not directly under U.N. , so as to avoid Russian vetoes . Member nations ( eight Western atomic powers ) would contribute materials and information , support it with money , make their scientists and facilities available to others . <P> The original U.S. plan for a kind of atomic bank , owning , storing and doling out its own atomic riches , had been changed after Russia refused to participate . Instead , said Lodge , the agency would act only as a " clearinghouse " for requests made by atomic " have-nots " - more a broker than a banker . <P> <P> Roses in the Deserts . Able New York Industrialist Morehead Patterson , appointed by President Eisenhower to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to " move fast . " But the U.S. was not going to wait for creation of the agency itself . To get Eisenhower 's program started in spirit and fact , the U.S. offered a proposition of its own . It was ready , said Lodge , to conclude bilateral agreements with other nations to help them build and operate research reactors ; the U.S. would furnish technical advice and help , and supply fissionable materials . In addition , the U.S. would throw open a large part of its research and training facilities to all nations . <P> <P> Early next year , said Lodge , the U.S. will establish a reactor training school to which 30 to 50 foreign scientists will be invited . The Atomic Energy Commission will sponsor courses , open to all nations , in atomic preventive medicine , disposal of atomic wastes , the use of radioisotopes as tracers . Brookhaven , Argonne and Oak Ridge will open to foreign scientists one-to two-year courses in the use of atomic energy in medicine and biology ; 150 foreign specialists will visit U.S. cancer research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ten complete libraries of nonclassified atomic publications totaling 300 feet of shelf space . <P> But most " have-not " nations seem to be chiefly interested in atomic power . The U.S. 's problem is to calm down the visionary while disproving the cynical . The excitable happily envision a kind of atomic Marshall Plan setting up atomic power reactors on every hilltop , making deserts bloom like a rose . The cynical doubt that anything will come of the plan but an exchange of talk and papers .
