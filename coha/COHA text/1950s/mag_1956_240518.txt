Back from ten days on the Red red carpet , the nine-man delegation from the National Council of Churches issued a care fully drafted formal statement about their get-acquainted expedition to Russia ( TIME , March 26 ) : " The experience was profitable . We understand the Russian church men better as a result of our conversations . . . The most severe limitation of the church is in the area of education . . . " <P> <P> But the group 's leader , the Rev. Dr. Eugene Carson Blake , president of the National Council and stated clerk of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. , went into more revealing detail last week in a series of three articles for the Associated Press . Writing for himself only , Dr. Blake showed he had a good journalist 's eye , though it was , he confessed , " almost permanently closed against klieg lights and flashbulbs . " <P> Divided Mind . Prague he found beautiful but " empty not only of traffic but also of moral animation . " In Moscow the varied and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereotype of the Communist Russian which is too prevalent in American thinking . " But the Americans found some troublesome stereotypes in Russian thinking . The Russians translated the National Council 's " Policy and Strategy Committee " as " Politics and War Committee , " and " it took several minutes of discussion to make clear that we really did believe in a true separation of church and state . . . " <P> <P> Dr. Blake came home with a divided mind about how closely U.S. churchmen should commune with Russian churchmen . <P> <P> " It would appear that the only result of any common effort for peace on the part of American and Russian churches would be to put the American churches in the position of being used by the Soviet Union for its political policy and propaganda , only to be dropped at any moment when they would be no longer useful . <P> " Our cynical advisers tell us that this is obvious and that any cooperation on our part can only lead to disillusionment and regret . But look at the other horn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 , 1954 decree by Khrushchev , outlining the new party line on religion , the churches in Russia are going to be free to establish ecclesiastical ties with other churches in the East and West , as they have not been since 1918 . <P> " If the churches in the West are cynically unwilling to give or to respond to gestures of friendship , they are false to their own conviction that one ought to love even his enemies . Furthermore , such reluctance would forfeit the chance of Western churches to help the Russian churches resist the more subtle but not less effective propaganda attack against religion . . .
