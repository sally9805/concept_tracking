In England last week , it was the Roman Catholics ' turn . They spoke up to answer the Archbishop of Canterbury and his church 's new pamphlet on Roman Catholicism ( TIME . Oct. 26 ) , and they used words like " shrill , " " juvenile , " and " uncharitable . " <P> The Anglican pamphlet drew most of the fire , but Father Thomas Holland , vice-superior of England 's Catholic Missionary Society , had a term for the Archbishop of Canterbury too , " The Strange Samaritan . " The archbishop 's rebuke to Roman Catholics , noted Father Holland in the Catholic Herald , had come just after some highly sympathetic remarks by the archbishop about the plight of the church in Poland . " Against the background of the Polish persecution . The Strange Samaritan has gently poured in acid . " <P> Sharpest counter-polemic came from Jesuit Father Joseph Christie , preaching in London . Answering the archbishop 's complaints of aggressive Catholic proselytizing . Father Christie said : " We do not need to seek converts ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church of England itself . <P> " The Anglican pamphlet is not so much an attack as an expression of interior distress . It is an attempt , resulting from distress , to create unity by negative means . The authors are expressing not so much what they believe as their wish to say : ' This is what we dislike . ' The pamphlet has little to add to ancient arguments beyond a certain bitterness of tone . " <P> In the U.S. this week , Presbyterian Life renews an old charge against Roman Catholics , to wit , attempted grand larceny of the word Catholic . In an article for Presbyterians titled You Are a Catholic , the Rev. Paul Austin Wolfe writes : " There has been persistent propaganda to apply the word Catholic to the Roman Church alone . On our town and city streets you will often find a sign saying ' The Catholic Church-Masses 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m . ' It is a sign put up by the Roman Church . In the armed forces chaplains are classified as Protestants , Catholics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two Greek words meaning ' according to the whole ' or ' universal ' . . . The Roman Church has been eager to have the American public believe that it is the ' one universal and true ' Christian church . Thereby other churches become mere sects , their Christian teaching at least partial and probably false , and all of them in rebellion against the true church founded by Christ . . . <P> " If the word Catholic is to be used , it should be preceded by the word Roman ... If our denominations were named as the Roman Church is named , we would be known as Presbyterian Catholics or The Catholic Church ( Methodist ) or The Lutheran Catholic Church . . . If we omit the word Catholic when referring to our own churches , however , it seems logical that we should also omit it when we mention the Church of Rome . "
