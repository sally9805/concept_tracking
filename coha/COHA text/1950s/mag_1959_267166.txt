Aspen groves cut swaths of delicate yellow flame through the valleys , and fresh snow coated the peaks . But few of the fiercely competitive driver-navigator teams in the 66 sports cars that set out from the outskirts of Denver last week in the Continental Divide Rally had time for any sightseeing . They were too engrossed in solving the exacting problems of driving and navigating presented by the nation 's toughest test in the growing postwar sport of " rallying . " Boasted one official of the Sports Car Club of America : " One goof and they 're out . " <P> The object of the Continental , oldest of the S.C.C.A. national rallies , sounded simple in theory : teams had to cover legs of a given course in a given time , were penalized for not passing checkpoints on schedule . Rallymaster Charles Sink had laid out a 630-mile , two-day course between Denver and Aspen over highways and dirt roads that crisscrossed the Continental Divide through passes more than two miles high . <P> Blocks &; Navigators . Over such a twisting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average speeds ( e.g. , 30.33 miles at 36.34 m.p.h. ) , and a single truck grinding up a narrow mountain road can throw a roadblock into the most delicate calculations . Heads low over their clipboards , navigators ( often long-suffering wives ) frantically figured rate-time-distance problems to tell their drivers how much to speed up in order to hit the next checkpoint on the button . Speedometers are considered far too inexact for rallyists ' standards . They rely on odometer and stopwatch , backed up by slide rule , $250 automatic computers , and short-wave radios that let a team check the exact time broadcast by the U.S. Bureau of Standards . But odometers are subject to errors of their own , since their accuracy depends on counting tire revolutions . Wheels slip on ice , snow or a stretch of gravel . Even a rain squall can induce an error , cooling the road surface and thereby reducing tire pressure and size . <P> Because rallyists , faced with these frustrations , have been known to seek the low road to success , Continental officials set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such old tricks as stopping just up the road from a checkpoint and waiting for the right moment to gun past the timers . <P> Ice &; Cattle . But the competing teams had no time to think up skulduggery ; an early-season storm turned roads into snow-clogged obstacle courses littered with jackknifed trailer trucks . Drivers fumed as they lost time putting on chains and crawling up mountains , tried to get back on schedule by hurtling down icy stretches at 70 m.p.h . In the valleys , they were slowed as they honked their way through meandering herds of cattle . Even so , Flight Engineer Mel De Loof covered the course as though it were laid out in a parking lot back home in Manhattan Beach , Calif . Beside him in his Jaguar XK-140 coupe was his wife Juanita . " If I get more than one-tenth of a mile off schedule , Juanita simply stops navigating , " cracked De Loof . " She figures if I 'm doing that badly I 'm just not driving right . " <P> When Juanita was done navigating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , missed ten of twelve others by no more than 15 seconds , and roared off with first place in one of the wildest rallies ever held along the backbone of the continent .
