By NOEL BARBER ROLLE , SWITZERLAND . It all started over lunch , as so many romances do . I arrived  --  aged forty-three  --  gay as a crickcs and , what 's more , free as a bird . I had a tiny apartment in Paris which I could , and did , lock up for weeks on end when on assignment as a foreign correspondent . Life was one long thrill on expense accounts . No wonder I had a few thousand dollars in the bank and lots and lots of friends . Then the dark-haired girl , half-Italian , half-Rumanian , was Weed next to me . I fell in love at first course . Now  --  two and a half years later  --  I sit in the garden of the old farmhouse I have bought overlooking Lake Geneva , and I take stock at the shattering transformation that has detonated my life . Two and a half years ago , as a bachelor approaching middle age , my family was one . Mc . Now , somehow  --  and I shall never quite know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there arc just about nine languages stuttering from room to room like a recording session at an examination for interpreters . It sounds crazy , I know , but there it is  --  to get along , we have to speak , among us , English , French , Italian , Danish , German , with a little Rumanian add Korean thrown in for good measure . Here is how . There is the breadwinner . I am English . There is Titina , my wife , who is Italian . I speak to her in French or English . She has a pretty , if slightly unusual , command of the latter language , samples of which I shall offer later . There arc my two children , eighteen months and . eighteen days at the time of writing , and neatly arranged . though I say it myself , as Bengy the elder and Simonetta the younger . Bengy already chatters  --  but only French and ' ' ' . Italian words . Simonetta so far only screams . But there are two other children . There is Titineg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husky sixteen-year-old called Musty . Normally he speaks French or Italian to his mother , French to me . You might think this enough for a newly married man to undertake . But if you do things at all , might as well do them thoroughly So in a moment of ? ? eakness I have never regretted , we adopted a ravishing seventeenyear-old niece of Titina 's called Emanuel : * She speaks only Italian . By now I can almost understand opera . Emanucla helps look after lkngy , but we have a nurse for Simonetta . Noss , Swiss nurses cost several earths and expect you to wait on them as well . So we imported a girl from Copenhagen , as I had once lived there and know them to be first-class nurses . But she speaks only Danish . She is called Crete , and she and T. a have just about enough words in common to stop the children from starving . But when there 's a really difficult problem to solve , lien poor papa . who speaks Danish , is called in unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven , including the breadwinner . But we had another problem to solve : How could we organize life so that occasionally Titina could get away with me on a trip ? After all , I am absent from home nine months or more of the year when you add all the trips together , so one way to enjoy life with my bride is to take her with me when I can . But Titina is an old-fashioned girl and flatly refused to leave even l3engy with the nurse and Emanucla , though we trust them both implicitly . So we overcame this difficulty by asking Titina 's mother to come and live with us . We call her Mamie , and she is a remarkable old Rumanian lady of seventy-one who smokes through long cardboard cigarette holders and whose best languages are unfortunately Rumanian and Korean . She picked up Korean while living in Seoul , where her husband was ambassador . She does talk Italian  --  hut not when excited . which is frequently And finally there is our treasure who cooks and washes and dusts ; old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , for the trouble with French Switzerland is that everybody is so darned rich that you can never get maids . But Else , our treasure , comes from a village near Zurich , and so , though I hardly like to mention it , she speaks only German-Swiss , though under the tutelage of my wife she has by now learned to cook in Italian . Well , there you arr . Long , long ago all my dollars  --  and many more  --  vanished in buying the farm and prams and teen-age clothes . Long , long ago all the peace 1 thought so necessary to creative writing vanished Coo . The old farmhouse is a babel . Mamie is crooning Bcngy to sleep in Korean  --  or Rumanian . Else 's guttural voice warns Titina there is " nicht spaghetti " in the pantry . Nurse is singing a Danish ditty . Musty in French demands that play tennis with him , and Emanucla in Italian wants to know if she ran play jazz on my radio . I move never , never been so happy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . my life marched with such precision and order that I was in the gravest danger of becoming quite impossible . I worked extremely hard , but in my leisure I demanded the best of everything with the minimum of fuss . 1 wore shirts made for Inc by Sulka in Paris , shoes from Lobb in London , and I ? ? ? nthusiast of mothers-44m , Rumanian brand , " declares family man Barber . April .0 , , ? ? , ? And So I Got Married ( Continued from Page 35 ) would n't dream of buying a tic ordressing gown except at Batlistoni in Rome . But yesterday I was looking through what one could laughingly describe as my wardrobe , and I found that my favorite tie cost a dollar  --  twelve months ago  --  and that really , my ready-made shoes are extremely comfortable . One dressing gown is quite enough  --  it has to be , for Musty has long since pinched the others . And before all this I thought I was happy . But all the same I had misgivings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its obvious advantages . I adore children  --  I really lose their company  --  but the idea of being a father instead of an uncle frightened me because of the responsibilities . I love the country  --  but the idea of settling my loose cash into a pile of bricks and mortar frightened me too . Well , now 1 have got what I asked for  --  or rather what I was afraid to ask for  --  and since the world is full of middle-aged bachelors afraid to take the plunge , maybe I can detail some of the problems and some of the magic that were mine in the transition from gay bachelor to polyglot papa . It is n't easy , an upheaval after the age of forty , for the trouble with adult life and change is not that your feelings alter , but that your emotions get wrecked and torn by material problems , and often there is very little you can do about them unless you make a big effort . And when you arc over forty you do n't like a change that demands a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was our separation . It is n't much fun for the bride of a newspaperman when he gets his marching orders halfway through lunch and sends her his first telegram when he lands in Timbuktu and does n't come hack to finish his lunch for two months . And in this age of war and strife , it is n't much fun being a young mother while papa is being stabbed by terrorists , as I was in Casablanca , or being shot , as I was by the Russians in Budapest , Yet if you are a writer you can not change a way of life that means more to you almost than life itself just because you fall in love , for you would end by hating the person who made you change . So we both had to adjust our personal relationships very quickly ; otherwise we would have been half married , half single , and you do n't have to be a divorce-court judge to know where that road leads . But quite apart from that , right at the start of our married life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child was on the way , we decided to give apartment life a miss and move to a new country . We chose Switzerland because taxwisc it 's wonderful , it is clean , property is reasonably cheap , and on the shores of Lake Geneva they speak French . On Our honeymoon we had driven along the lake and stayed a couple of nights at a town called Rolle . It is a town , though it has only 2000 inhabitants , and it lies about midway between Geneva and Lausanne . The lake sits gently in front of the main street , with eternal snows on the mountains that dominate it , and , behind , the vineyards sweep up to the sky lint . So I took a week 's vacation and we motored there in my spanking Citroen , the pride of my existence and  --  like everything bought before my marriage , from phonograph discs to automobiles  --  bought for me and me alone . We installed ourselves in the hotel at Rolle , where they remembered our confetti , and on the first morning I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? is a very serious business . We 've got to be very careful . We 'll comb the lakeside and look at every single empty house before deciding anything . " In order to carry out this ambitious program we needed gas for the car , so we stopped at garage in the main street . Madame Utilel is a nice , homely country woman , and she remembered our confetti too . " But if you 're going to look for houses , " she confided , " you really ought to go and look at an empty farmhouse just a quarter of a mile behind the town . " So we went to see it  --  our first inspection . We were accompanied by Monsieur Peter  --  that 's his surname  --  a dignified gentleman who is mayor , bank manager . estate agent and just about everything else in Rolle , " Now remember , " I whispered to Titina as we drove up , " this is just the beginning , so do n't lose your head . " 11 was at the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit trees , a fair slice of land and , in front of the kitchen and barn doors , a fountain that spilled mountain water into a trough where once the horses had drunk . The house itself was long and low and of stone . " Amusing , " I said nonchalantly to Monsieur Peter . Then I felt a small Italian hand creep into mine as I looked out at the snow-clad mountains . And there was Titina , and in her two big dark eyes were the beginnings of two tears . We bought it before lunch . It had no water laid on , no drains , no heating , no lighting . But it was lovely . Monsieur Peter drew up the deeds in the bank and then introduced us to a quaint old Swiss banking custom that I strongly urge other countries to adopt . The signing over , he unlocked with some ceremony a stout door at the rear of his office , through which we walked into a real , old wine cellar , gravel on the floor , hundreds of bottles tfulli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses . We uncorked a bottle of good Swiss wine and toasted our new home . With the possibility of discussing future overdrafts in such convivial surroundings , I opened an account with Monsieur Peter on the spot . It took three months or more to lick the Farm into some sort of shape and I was away all the time , so poor Titina had to look after the work . Before I left 1 rented a temporary bungalow for the family and then I went off to foreign parts . To assess the changed character of polyglot papa , it is important to note that this bungalow was a few miles from 1 97 the farm , and though Mamie looked after Bengy , Titina had to visit the farm each day to superintend the work . As she had an Italian driving license , it was only natural that I left her my automobile . the Citroen . It shows the depth of my love that she was the first woman who ever drove it . Alas , I did not know then the ways of Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of pull roar with laughter at the idea of such silly things as taking driving tests . If you know somebody , you get a license , and then you have a shot at driving . When I left Geneva airport and I showed Titina the gear positions , I thought she looked a trifle startled . but 1 put it down to wifely sorrow at our parting . All ! That was a car , that Citroen . I loved her dearly , I returned three months later , and somehow  --  we shall never know how , for these things arc veiled in mystery  --  Titina had managed not only to dent every fender but even to knock numbers off the license plates . It was not love , but self-defense that made me visa the gallant Monsieur Peter and , over a bottle of wine , ask for a quick 5500 to buy the poor girl a secondhand auto . I did n't want her to suffer from an eternal guilt complex . It was during this trip that I first tasted the joys of correspondence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand . Emanuela wrote me in Italian . so I had to buy a dictionary . Musts wrote in French . Titina though , as a surprise . wrote me every single day in English . But Tama is as impatient as she is pretty and , though she actually speaks very good English . if she does not have the correct word at hand , she makes one up . She says it is quicker than looking up the word on a dictionary , a point of view that had not hitherto occurred to me . And furthermore , until our marriage she had spoken Ina never written our tongue . Thus I became involved in an exchange of correspondence resulting almost in the birth of a new language . When I was in cold climates , a letter implored me , " Please , darling , be careful not to catch an ammonia . " When I forgot to reply to specific questions about the house , I was reproved gently . " You must please reed my letters more attentiously . " Then Bengy had such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can hardly brief . " But at least dunng these difficult times my letters to Mina arrived regularly " and you will never know how tech letter is a frill . " Life was difficult , but like a good Italian  --  and what good wives they do makeTittna kept the cost down , telling me so with . " I can promise you , deer , 1 will never be spendencious . " There was a minor crisis when Mamie hurt her hand . " She put it in mistake into scaldacious water , but despite our disordinate life , we are happy . " Finally I armed home at Geneva airport  --  yes , " home " ? and l looked in blank dismay at the tattered remains of my fastest girl friend , the Citroen . " Now , daromit ? " I began . " Yes , darling , " said Titina nervously , " I do listen , I suspend your lips . " Which is why there was never a row about the Citroen . Oh , what the heck 's one automobile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , by now installed in " Three Circles Farm . " It had been a hard trip , more than 30,000 miles and a lot of work , but now I had a home and I looked forward to peace and quiet after those grueling three months away , At last I had a well-ordered household , and I imagined the quiet evenings with a little good music , 98 some of the latest books , a pretty wife , no worries . Ah , sweet dreams ! I lost ten pounds  --  and ten years  --  on that first trip home . Emanuela had fallen in love . Not very seriously perhaps , but the boy had a jeep . I suppose that was the reason . Well , that had to be sorted out , and explanations made that she really was far too beautiful for a jeep , and she had better wait a bit anyway . I sorted that one out in Italian . Crete , our nurse , was pining for Denmark , or at least for Danish food , and I do n't blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I sorted that one out in Danish  --  by telephoning to Copenhagen and having u Danish smiirgachord air-freighted out to Geneva for us . That kept Grew quiet for a while . Then there was Musty . Though he had persuaded me to take up tennis again and we played together , it was n't easy making friends with a stepson of sixteen , especially one with Italian blood in his veins . The Italians are % iolently jealous and suspicious , and he hated the idea that his mamma , single and close to him for ten years , now ) ( wed somebody else . And naturally , with our " thsordinate " life . I demanded that Titina and l spend quite a lot of time alone and slip into Geneva or Lausanne for quiet dinners when we felt ( like it . So Musty sulked . He missed Paris . He refused to make friends with the nice families around . He hated the country . He certainly hated mc . He hated life . Then one day I could stand his long face no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage , I slapped him so hard at the dining table that I nearly knocked him off his chair . For ten years no man had hit him . Good boy  --  he held back the tears as , in a scarlet-faced fury , he left the room . A couple of hours later he came and apologized , and so did I. That was the moment I ceased to be a stepfather and became a real father . The next time I had to visit Paris on business , " we men " left the women behind , and Musty and I drdve there alone , and l took him for his first dinner at Maxim 's . Our friendship has never wavered since . Astepson was a problem . but my mother-in-law presented none . From now on , I am a desoted enthusiast of mothers-in-law  --  Rumanian brand . I was frightened at first . The old music-hall joke about the mother-in-law dies hard , and as I settled down to life with a wife younger than myself , I wanted to be surrounded by the young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have codes of their own , for Mamie 's attitude is simple , If y ou do n't want to be an old lady spending your remaining years in a lonely bed-sitting room , then treasure your chance by keeping out of the way . In the eighteen months sincc we settled here in this farmhouse , I have had dinner with Mamie only once and lunched with her at the table twice . No amount of cajoling  --  even if actuated by a feeling of guilt rather than sincerity  --  van make her join us . Every time I arrive back from a trip abroad , she vanishes . She cats in the old spacious kitchen or on a tray in her room . If she is playing with Bengy in the field and I walk toward them , she fades away . If I ask her to come to the local cinema , she pretends to be tired , even though I know she loses the cinema . We all love her , and I think she loves me and her life with us . But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having a polyglot family has one great advantage  --  we get a polyglot cuisine . Else , our German-Swiss factotum , is hot on wiener schnitzel. and also roast pork with red cabbage . Titina looks after the spaghetti and pasta department . hlamio takes an occasional turn at the stove to produce a ripsnorting goulash that fairly reeks of the Balkans , while Nurse  --  usually on a Sunday  --  cooks us a Danish lunch . So we do n't only speak , we cat in different languages , and the only language and food that is missing is English . Early I set about remedying the lack of English food . It 's one thing to be fairly fluent with spaghetti , but now and again the lone Englishman who occasionally visits Lscept for the worries of a railroad and a ixditical faction , the United States today might take in all of Lower California and the nortlesmt rnrner of Mexico proper .

So James Gadsden. a prominent South Carolina planter who was then Minister to Mexico , was told to offer Se0,000,000 for a triangle of land taking in Northwest Mexico all the way down to the port of Guaymas , on the Gulf of California , plus all of Lower California . Mexico , though nearly prostrate , refused . Suddenly she received unexpected support from within the United States . Powerful railroad interests backing a transcontinental line along the northern route from Chicago to San Francisco wanted no deal by which a shorter line could reach the sea at Guaymas . Antislavery politicians objected that the transaction would add a huge expanse to the slavery area of the South . The combination of railroad and antislavery interests prevailed upon Congress to whack the proposition down to 513,000,000 for the Gila River watershed , a smaller triangle between the Gila , Rio Grande and Colorado rivers . The Mexican Government was then headed by Antonio Lopez de his farm pines for the substantial faro that actually does exist in Britain , though Americans will never believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steak and oyster pudding , for even simple English dishes presented enormous problems . but I am trying . It is , however , a costly business . My first request , before the advent of our maid and nurse , was very simple . It was the case of the boiled onions . Now .1 happen to like boiled onions . It is rude country fare , but an excellent way of starting a meal and , as I explained , quite simple to make : A big plate of onions , Santa Anna , the general who had seized the Alamo years earlier . Santa Anna , often pro-American , played coy and hard to get . Gadsden slashed the offer from S15,0oo , coo to a meager S10,000,000 on a take-it-or-leave-it basis , and sat back . Santa Anna grabbed Angry Islexicans subsequently ran him out of the country as a traitor . The successful Gadsden scarcely fared better . Bitter critics in the United States termed the +5,555 sandy , arid square miles that he bought " our national cactus garden " and " rattlesnake heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colorado River fifteen miles south of Yuma , United States and Mexican commissioners got into a dispute . They arc said to have adjourned to a Yuma saloon for repeated rounds of friendly drinks , after which they sighted their transit through the swinging barroom doors at a point aerate the river and called the job done . Whatever the truth , there is a distinct jog in the boundary at that point . " Rattlesnake heaven , " now the lower part of New Mexico and Arizona , has paid for itself many times over through mineral wealth , such as the great copper deposits at Ajo . Meanwhile American tourists can " go native " at colorful Mexican resorts like Tijuana , Agua Caliente and l'sfe-sicali , all of which would have been in the sober-sided United Stairs under the original deal . Clarence M. Conkling g well boiled , and covered with a cheese sauce . I arrived home that night as hungry as a hunter to find the most depressing specs Were of our early marriage . I had omitted to mention that the dish should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score of sad , willed , shrunken onions , covered with a gluey substance like wallpaper paste . It was a grave moment , calling for instant action . Just as when a flier crashes he must immediately take to the air again , so a cook who falters must return to her stove before she loses her nerve , Together we put a fresh serving of onions in the pan to boil . But for how long ? And what about that cheese sauce ? How to make it the way my mother used to make it ? Well , I hand it to Titina , they were wonderful . The dish came out rather expensive , but you ca n't blame a girl for taking no chances when cooking in a foreign language . To make sure all went well , Titina telephoned my sister-in-law , SOO miles assay in London and , at a cost not to be despised , the two ladies kept up a running cookery lesson until the onions were done to a turn . Of course , the moral to all this story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can form your own private United Nations , you will be happier than you ever imagined it possible to be . I must warn you that if you are set in your ways and you like every book to be in its place as I do , and you would never dare to play a phonograph disc without first wiping it with one of those patent cloths , you will find your books vanish unaccountably , and the record cloth has been used to clean the silver , and you will be driven crazy . And you have no idea what a damned nuisance four children can be when you acquire them all in two years . The teenagers , whom I nester watched growing , but who came to me ready-made , arc at times insufferable . I am sure Emanuele still pines for that fellow with the jeep . It was n't even a new jeep . And I know Musty is aching to return to Paris , Bengy is impossible . How can you write a book when some wretched brat screams all day long for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to him . And as for Simonetta  --  why , it 's just absurd . I still ca n't understand how a baby can cry that much and still live . And the money that goes ! Fancy having a nurse who speaks only Danish , a maid who can talk only German ! Why , it 's ridiculous ! And Mamie , there she is , a good sort , of course , but who wants the children to be brought up swearing in Korean ? No , I never knew just how tofigh life could be as a polyglot papa . And then suddenly everything clicked . I shall remember the moment forever . I came back from the Belgian Congo , landing at six A.M. at Geneva airport , after a day and a night in the air . I joined the crocodile of people filing toward the immigration authorities and I thought , half asleep , Well , here It goes again , the worst part of my Joh , landing lonely With the dawn . I would get me a taxi and drivo the half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely landings . I walked through the customs shed , cleared my tattered old suitcase  --  and there they were , the whole darned family , screaming and yelling . They had all come down to meet me . Bengt ' actually recognized me  --  yes , dammit , he did  --  and banged everything within reach , including a Swiss policeman , as he cried " Alto , papa ! " Emanucla and Titina fought to plant kisses on my cheeks , and Titina whispered , " Alio adorato . " Musty , too grown up ( Continued on Page 100 ) ( Continued from Page YS ) for this sort of nonsense , asked with the gravest urgency  --  in French , of course  --  if I would be free to play tennis today . And we all those back home singing in the car . Thc flowers were out , the apples were ripening . Mamie made a rare appearance gathered below at the terminal building . II was eleven tssa , so we were pretty sure that those people must be waiting for the Braves . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they 'd gathered to throw stones at us . When we started down the ramp from the plane . the crowd cheered us just as if it were a victory celebration . There must have been 15,000 to 20,000 men , women and children , including some parents with babies in their arms . Some of the people were crying . Many of them patted us on the back and told us not to worry , that we 'd gel them neat year . Some of the players stopped to chat with the fans . Most of the boys did n't feel like talking . Thc Chamber of Commerce had arranged buses for the learn to ride into town , but only five of us got aboard . I do n't remember who the others were : I was too busy feeling sorry for myself , and promising myself that we would win it for those fans the nest year . An caps:rot:rice like that can either kill you or inspire you . Here was a mob of fans just as disappointed as we were , and they had shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wonderful loyalty . but still it made me become irritated with myself . It made me feel chat we should have done more . The feeling we carried away from that night stayed with us all winter . I think this is the inspiration that will drive us to the pennant this season . I do n't believe there was a player who reported to training this spring at Bradenton , Florida . who was n't determined to win a pennant for those Milwaukee fans . They ' se stuck by us since we moved there from Boston in 1953 . Three times vese finished second and one time third , but we 've never given them the thrill of a pennant . On the other hand , they'se gisen us the biggest and most worshipful following in the majors . We were in Milwaukee over three years before we heard our first boo . Where else do you find fans like that ? In the National League race this year . Brooklyn is still the team to beat . But the Dodgers will not be the same superior ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit , they lost a real spark plug . They 'll have lost another if Pee Wee Reese ca n't play every day . And there arc question marks . Maybe Roy Campanella will come hack and maybe he wo n't . How can you count on Don Newcombe to win twenty-seven games again , or Sal Maglic to win , say , fifteen ? Apitcher who might pick up some of the slack is Clem Labine , the most underrated player on the club last year . The Dodgers also have a lot of promising new players around , and Gil Hodges , Carl Furillo and Duke Snider seem ageless . But the years arc catching up with the Dodgers . Their domineering days arc over . Cincinnati was a powerhouse last season . The Redlegs hit 221 home runs to tic the all-time major-league record . Johnny Temple and Roy McMillan were the best double-play combination in the majors . Even their pitching , notoriously vulnerable for several seasons , was improved . to welcome me in Rumanian  --  or was it Korean ? Nurse said , " Gus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to change and take a bath . A pile of bills was waiting to be paid , but what the hell , it 's only money . All over the house a babel of tongues was But a lot of those Cincinnati players had as good a season last year as they 'll ever have . Although manager Birdie Tcbbetts did a great job of building up their confidence . I do n't know how long that college psychology course he took can hold out . And I doubt that he can come up with another find like Frank Robinson , who was the league 's rookie of the year in 1956 . Thinking of Cincinnati 's deal with the Chicago Cubs for Warren Hacker , you 'd say their pitching should be better . But will ii ? Can Brooks Lawrence win nineteen again , and can the Redlegs get the same kind of relief work out of Hershel ! Freeman , who won fourteen games ? And on the physical side , will Ted Kluszew ski be able to play regularly ? As for the St. Louis Cardinals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they were the team that knocked us out of it down the stretch last year . They will be improved this season , but they still have to be considered outsiders . They may have trouble in the outfield . Del Ennis will have a tougher park to hit in than he did in Philadelphia . Center field could he a problem , although one of the candidates , Bobby Del Greco , is a fielding genius . I say this with a bleeding heart . When I lost a fatal 2-I decision to the Cards in twelve innings the next-tolast day 1,1 the 1956 season , Del Greco beat me with two fantastic catches , off Ed Mathews and Jack Dittmar . But lie has yet to prove that he can do a hitting job over the course of a season . All this is a negative approach , of course . On the positive side are the Braves themselves , not a great ball club , but more talented than the last Braves team to win a pennant  --  the Boston Braves of 1948 . The only remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan , now one of our coaches ; Huh Keely , the bullpen catcher , and myself . Thc Braves of today are an entirely ditTerent type of club . The 194/t Braves were an old , experienced team that nobody picked to win . In some respects it was a makeshift team . Manager Billy Southworth made a lot of fading veterans  --  I use that term with some reservations  --  till some vital gaps . He shifted an awful lot to meet emergencies . The way the Yankees have been winning in recent seasons , people seem to have forgotten that somebody used the platoon system before Casey Stengel . That was the secret of the 1948 Braves . Southworth played checkers with his men . Only Al Dark at shortstop , Bob Elliott at third and Tommy Holmes in the outfield played full time . The rest alternated according to the pitching . One day Danny Litwhiler hit a home run in the first inning , then was lifted for a pinch hitter because a righthanded pitcher time in , That was the year of the little rhyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This was an injustice to many other players who were important to the club 's success , but I 'd go along with the Sain angle under any circumstances .

And I would n't give up my polyglot family for all the lonely freedom the world could give me , not for anything . won only fifteen  --  the third lowest total of my career in the majors . Nelson Potter and Bobby Hogue did great relief jobs . Bobby won six games that I started , and saved a number of other games that he did n't get credit for , Bill Voiselle and Vern Bickford took starting turns , and contributed much to our pennant drive . Earl Torgeson had a fine season , alternating at first base with Frank McCormick , Bob Elliott was the most valuable player in the league  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke his leg late in September , we came up with Marvin Rickert as his replacement . Rickert brought off the greatest catch I ever had made behind me , in the World Series game I won in Cleveland  --  a diving catch of a low line drive . ' There was a fabulous spirit about that team . It was n't like a fraternity off the field , but on the field the players fought like cats and dogs to win . In the ninth inning against Chicago one day. , when we were two runs behind , Elliott hit a homer with the bases empty . He came back to the dugout cussing because there had been nobody on have to tie it up . Frank McCormick , the next batter , hit one a little higher up in the stands . The game was tied , and we won in extra innings . That 's the way things went all season long . The great team spirit carried us all the way .
