In Hamburg , Germany , anyone can dial 4166 and hear hit records of the week . Most startling selection : Louis Armstrong playing and croaking a catchy 4/4 time ditty called Mack the Knife : <P> Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear <P> And he shows them a-pearly white , <P> Just a jackknife has Macheath dear <P> But he keeps it out of sight . . . <P> The appearance of this song as an American jazz hit marks the end of a remarkable odyssey ; Mack the Knife , originally the prologue of Kurt Weill 's famed Threepenny Opera , was first heard in Berlin 28 years ago . It also marks a remarkable revival , on records , of Kurt Weill 's other music-the legacy of a strange , half-angry , half-sentimental genius . <P> Underdog Snarl . Most of Weill 's early opera music was the song of Berlin between the wars , the city that Christopher Isherwood wrote about in the Berlin Stories-starvation side by side with luxury , Nazi and Communist bullyboys in the streets , cynicism as heavy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Threepenny Opera echoed that city . Vaguely based on John Gay 's 18th century original , the German libretto by Poet Bert Brecht ( now a propaganda wheel in East Germany ) had a vicious underdog snarl ( " First fill our bellies , then talk morality " ) and magnificent , vulgar humor . Like the rest of the work , Mack the Knife* was a bitter satire of society and of schmalzy , popular music ; it gave a ragtime catalogue of murder , arson and rape . <P> There are now no less than 17 recorded versions of Mack the Knife spinning across the U.S. , and most of the horror has gone out of it . U.S. Composer-Author Marc Blitzstein has effectively translated the Berlin slang into American , but as Satchmo growls the words , the listener is amused rather than chilled by the corpse sinking into the river , weighted down by what Armstrong insists on calling " ceee-ments . " <P> Other versions are even farther away from the original . Les Paul ( Capitol ) gives it a zithery sound , Tito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaughan ( Dot ) features an off-key whistler . But most versions retain the original 's deliberately poverty-stricken melody-five of its eight phrases end on the same querulous note . <P> Vintage Rotgut . For those who want to hear the original version , there is a new Threepenny Opera album in German ( Vanguard ) , fascinating largely because it shows how difficult it is for vintage rotgut to travel . The " chamber orchestra " of the august Vienna State Opera bravely buckles down to the hurdy-gurdy score with its plinky-plink banjos , but it is played with excruciating slowness . The star is a charming Viennese nightclub chanteuse named Liane , who sounds less like Polly Peachum than an operetta shopgirl mooning over an archduke . The record does have its high spots , notably the duet between the prostitute Jenny and her pimp . To a wistful tango melody they coo : <P> We wo n't forget , wherever we may roam <P> The dear old whorehouse where we made our home . . . <P> On a Columbia LP , Lotte Lenya sings Berlin Theatre Songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Knife and other Threepenny ditties as they should be done . Fiftyish , and after two years of starring in a successful New York revival of the work , Lotte Lenya still sings with a smoky , strangely appealing quality that always suggests the waif beneath the cynic .
