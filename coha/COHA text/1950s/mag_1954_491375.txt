HE air is chill , this March evening in 1948 , but there is a promise of spring in it . A car drives around behind a large , handsome , brand-new home in the sleepy college town of Bloomington , Indiana . In the car is a good-looking young man upon whom fortune has showered blessings : he is physically healthy . happily married ; his book is a best-seller ; he has just been paid 8150,000 for movie rights to it ; he is full of honors and acclaim . For this young man is Ross Lockridge , Jr. , thirty-three , author of the novel Raintree County , and brilliantly successful . But what is young Mr. Lockridge doing ' ? He drives into his garage and locks the door , but he lets the engine continue to run ; now he seats himself in the driver 's seat , thinking such thoughts as only his Maker knows , while the motor continues to idle . After some minutes , he slumps inertly over the wheel . The harsh light shines down and the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his terrified wife and neighbors break in the door and find him there , far beyond any help . Why ? What makes a person do such a thing ? We human beings cling to life so tenaciously , despite our fears and burdens , that the act of suicide is a horror and a mystery . And in most cases , as in Lockridge 's , the mystery is never really solved . Yet an even greater mystery is the fact that our society does little or nothing about suicide . It is , after all , the killing of a human being . In 1952 , 8270 people in the United States were murdered by other human beings , but 16,030 died by their own hands . Actually the figure is probably much higher . Be-. cause of society 's condemnation , a great many cases of suicide are concealed by the relatives . In addition , most psychiatrists believe that a number of the 39,000 annual auto deaths involve a subconscious impulse to self-destruction . At a conservative guess , therefore , between 25,000 and 50,000 Americans take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 others attempt suicide , but fail  --  often to try again . Yet , although we have extensive police departments and courts which try to prevent and solve murders , our coroners and medical examiners and public hospitals are able to give only the most perfunctory attention to preventing or explaining suicides . Nor is suicide the kind of thing that never happens to you , but only to other people . A sociologist in Chicago and a psychiatrist in New York have separately sampled groups of healthy normal people and found that about 80 per cent of them admit to having thought about committing suicide . Thinking about it is n't the same as committing it , yet the figures seem to mean that nearly all of us harbor a mysterious urge to self-destruction ? an urge most of us would , most of the time , violently deny having . Psychiatrists the world over agree that the real reasons for any suicide are almost always hidden from outsiders , indeed from the victim himself . And because the real reasons are deeply buried in our subconscious minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee for thol Study of Suicide , Inc. , " we grasp at any straw of external plausibility when faced with the discomfort of looking closer and deeper into the problem of life and death . " A case in point concerns a plump , balding , fortynine-year-old hardware dealer . One Sunday afternoon last summer . his own mouth , opened the jet and lay down on the linoleum floor to die . According to the newspaper accounts , a friend tried to call him , got no answer , became worried and finally called the police . A squad car arrived , broke down the door and found the dealer unconscious , but still alive . A suicide note stated that he was too ill to wish to continue living . The explanation seems satisfactory . A man could reasonably want to kill himself if he were dying anyhow . But the hardware dealer was n't that sick . and he is n't now . Back at work , he never discusses his " accident , " and the friend who summoned help is a perplexed man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently . " He was n't really very sick ; just a little of this and that . And do you know why I called the police ? Because he had called me on the phone . Sounded stinking drunk . He most have taken some gas already . then called me , then gone back for more . I guess some part of him did n't really want to die ; he did n't have any good reasons I know of , and I know him pretty well . How do you figure it , anyhow ? " Detectives both of fact and of fiction seldom accept the obvious clues to murders or the plausible alibis of the suspected . But they and the rest of W3 eagerly accept any plausible " reasons " for suicide , even though , like the hardware dealer 's illness , these explanations often fail to stand up . In Fort Worth , in 1952 , thirty-one-year-old Air Force Capt . Arthur Nelson shot himself to death in his bathroom ; in a note , he said he was doing it , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect his $10,000 insurance . Yet how could a man help such a woman less efficiently than by leaving her alone , helpless  --  and with only $10,000 ? Ottmar Fischer . a twenty-five-year-old German baker , had just arrived in San Francisco last summer after a long wait on the quota list . The fog rolled into the harbor . Fischer paced the floor of his aunt 's apartment hour by hour , and told her the foghorns reminded him of air-raid sirens . Finally he ran to the roof and leaped four stories to his death . That is all the police and coroner need to know , but who can he satisfied that a man could kill himself for such a reason when millions who lived through air raids feel no such urge ' ? The commonest of all explanations offered by would-be suicides , according to the National SaveA-Life League , a volunteer organization which tries to talk them out of it , is that they " are tired of life and find it intolerable , " but Doctor Zillioorg , whose files include an exhaustive analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has proven to be the least frequent of the valid explanations . If the difficulty of living could , by itself , cause suicide , there would be a thousand times as many as there now are . " Whatever a suicide may or may not have known about , life , he almost certainly did not know the real reasons for his own final bitter deed . And , for the most part , neither does anyone else . Yet , although mysteries ordinarily intrigue us , and violent crime moves us to strenuous efforts at investigation and punishment , suicide remains largely ignored or is dealt with in the most superficial manner by the law and the public-health agencies of the nation . In the average city , for instance , when the body of a suicide is found an inspector from the medical examiner 's or coroner 's office goes along with police to have a look . If the circumstances or the existence of witnesses makes it clearly a case of suicide , the body is quickly released to the relatives ' undertaker and the victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but why that hand so acted we have no true idea . " We do n't even try to look for the real motives , " says an otlicial of the New York City chief medical examiner 's office . " All we 're concerned with is , are they real suicides or not ? " Cases which are not clear-cut remain at the morgue and are autopsied in the effort to prove the manner of death . If even t hen the situation remains unclear , the D.A . gets the case and investigates the possibilities of homicide . Even this limited amount of investigation  --  cold . frigid , dehumanized  --  is in large part due to the complications of insurance law . Moat companies do not pay benefits if suicide occurs in less than one year , or sometimes two , after the policy took force ; and all companies refuse to pay a double-indemnity accident benefit to the beneficiary of a suicide . As a result of these rules , relatives quite often bring suit against the insurance companies , and juries have been known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief medical examiner 's testimony . One recent case involved a man who was killed by a subway train WO yards down the track from the station , where he had no possible reason to be walking . His coat had been left behind , neatly folded , at the edge of the platform ? a typical last act of many jumpers and self-hangers . But his widow sued the insurance company for double-indemnity accident benefits , and since t here was no other evidence , such as poison in the stomach , she won . Such is the extent of society 's interest in those who have died by their own hand . Its interest in those who wish to die , but are not yet dead , is somewhat keener  --  or at least more dramatically expressed . The job of foiling suicide attempts falls to the police department . In New York City , for instance , a special section known as the Emergency Service Division handles this assignment , along with many others . When a call comes in about a jumper poised on some window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ii1111 ( 1.11111. .11 loan 25 ) gas seeping out from behind some locked door , radio patrol cars of the Hmergency Service Division rush to Ise scene . as does a specially equipped ruck which carries antijumper nets , iiiiialatont and other first-aid equipment . If the police successfully talk the ; limper in or revive the gassed victim , i hey send him in an : mil oulance to Bellevue Psychiatric or some oilier city hospital . Here t he staff psychiat rists and of her workers make a " case work-up , " which consists of interviews , tests and a certain amount of therapy in the form of discussions with the psychiatrist and possibly some shock treatments . At the end of the work-up , which takes between one and two weeks , about two birds of the cases are considered out of " immediate danger " and they are released to relatives or in their own custody . The others are committed to state or private hospitals for further treatment . City funds permit nothing more to he done for the two thirds who are released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it scarcely ever uncovers the hidden factors that caused the wild act , and certainly it has little chance of making permanent changes in the patient 's personality or pattern of life . Of course , the search for the real causes of suicide has not been entirely ignored . For over half a century , sociologists , statisticians and others have been examining the death rates from suicide in various ways , and have made a number of surprising discoveries , An Italian named Mors.elli found long ago , for instance . that . suicide rates in England and Scandinavia were higher than those in Italy . The former are foggy and gloomy , Italy is sunny and cheerful . Erg " , said Morselli , had weather causes suicide . In the United States , Seattle  --  which has more rain than almost . any other major city  --  has Iwo and a half times as many suicides per 100,000 people as the rest of the country . But actuary Walter G. Bowerman recently spoiled this " explanation " by showing that the five rainiest states in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the five driest average out quite high . The clichk of literature hold wintertime , the lonely week end and t he dark of night to he the most likely times for suicide , All three clich  --  s are wrong , according to doctors of the Harvard School of Puhlic Health who surveyed all available data and found that springtime , Monday and Tuesday , and morning are the most likely times . Some scholars have maintained that religion plays a major part , and point right hack to Morselli 's figures . Italy is Cat holic , Scandinavia Protestant . The Cat holic Church takes a sterner view of suicide than the Protestant churches . Hence , the rates are low . Ireland 's rate is about one tenth that of Denmark ; Prussia 's rate is much higher than that of Catholic Bavaria . But a recent survey in Toronto clouded this picture by producing evidence of a higher suicide ratio for Catholics than for Protestants in that city , and Catholic Austria has one of the highest rates in Europe today . There does seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents of large families than among the child-leas ? hut does it mean that children 11:11iNINO POST are n kind of prophylactic or that pc : - tentially suicidal personalitiesdon I. choose to have children ? For half a century suicide rates in the United States have been higher in cities than in the country , and the larger t he city the higher the rate . Does this mean I hid the hick of belonging to small social groups is to blame or that people with an X-factor in their personalities tend to migrate into cities , where they later commit suicide and make the rates high ? Hard times are commonly thought to cause more suicide , and 1932 marked the high point of recent American suicide history . But oddly enough , the rate had been rising from 1923 on , all through the years of the lag boom . It is the richer states that have the higher rates , and within each state it is not the Poor classes that are most suicide-prone , but the middle class and t he rich . Age apparently has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicides below the age of fifteen . Then the rates rise steadily , getting larger for each later decade of life , although beyond the seventies the figures are too small to be reliable . This has the sound of an understandable concept  --  the less life there is ahead , the less one wants to hold onto it . But to turn This digestible idea into a lump of stone , you need only separate the male statistics from the female . It is true that n larger proportion of men commit suicide in each older age group , but suicide among women levels off at about the change of life and never goes higher . Again , a mystery . But while the statistical approach has , in general , proved disappointing , some encouraging sparks of light have been struck recently by a group of investigators digging from another direction altogether ? the psychiatrists . They have , to be sure , come up with no single dramatic revelation , no beautifully simple wonder-drug solution . But from the intimate study of tens of thousands of cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last fifteen or twenty years . Take the case of a lady whom I shall call Mrs. Sally Collins . On a Friday morning about six months ago , she stood at the kitchen sink of her pleasant suburban home outside Boston . She was trying to wash the dishes , but her hands were shaking . They had been shaking for months , more and more . Mrs. Collins , a little , plain-looking , graying woman of forty-five , had been under a strain for many years , what with her husband 's business deep in debt , a daughter chronically ill of a glandular disease , and a son critically wounded in Korea . But a year ago things had taken a turn for the better : Collins ' business got a big , steady , new account ; the boy came home on the mend : and the daughter 's illness began to yield to a new hormone treatment . That made Mrs. Collins ' condition all the more peculiar , for it was only since these happy events that she had begun to feel increasingly gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly any more ; her children were grown and ready to leave home ; the very sight of her careworn face and lumpy body in the mirror offended her . As she washed dishes that morning a terrible thing happened to Mrs. Collins . " All of a sudden I felt my mind split right apart , " she says . " Thpenla piece of it stood up on end and toppled over . I wanted to scream out , but I said to myself , ' That was your unconscious mind that fell over . Get hold of yourself . Think your way out of it . ' " February to . lerrt The rest of the ( bailee wont unwashed while she eat , down and thought . Weeks went by , and she still sat around and thought 1111 day . She was confused , incoherent , totally unable to attend to her housework ; even to lift the phone and order groceries seemed an immense task . One day she finally found an answer . " I 'm losing my mind , " she figured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . misery and sickness ; I 'll be a burden on my husband , a shame to my children . There is one intelligent choice  --  death . That 's logical , reasonable . That 's the best possible answer for me . " Mrs. Collins thereupon poured out a glass of milk and with it chased down eighty-live aspirin tablets . Several hours later she was discovered gasping and in a coma by her daughter . In the hospital her stomach was washed out , and by the next day she was recovering from the drug . Since then she has spent half a year in a leading mental hospital in the East , making an excellent beginning toward complete recovery from her nervous breakdown . But had Mrs. Collins died , what reasons would have been given ? Exhausted from overwork ? Despondent because of ill health ? The facts belie either answer ; she should have been happier and less likely to desire death than at any other time in nearly twenty-five years . The causes of her suicide lay deeply hidden in her subconscious , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For despite the theoretical and technical differences among the many contemporary schools in psychiatry , they almost all agree on one thing : our conscious motives do not adequately explain human behavior , especially pathological behavior . Much or most of what we do and think is shaped by the subconscious , and by desires and experiences that have been forcibly " forgotten . " This was the crux of Sigmund Freud 's original work , which centered about the basic sex drive . Freud claimed that the sex drive existed even in infants , and that it was responsible for much of our subconscious motivation , our character formation and ? when misdirected ? our neurotic tendencies . But Freud and other psychiatrists kept finding so many aspects of human behavior which did not relate to this drive that in his later life he reformulated his thinking into a dual-instinct theory . There are two basic conflicting instincts , he said : love ( sex , creativity , eelf-preservation ) and hate destruclion , aggression and the drive toward death ) . Dr. Karl Menninger , who , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinic , foundation and school that bears their name in Topeka , Kansas , is one of the psychiatrists who have developed and applied this dual-instinct theory , especially in trying to solve the mystery of suicide . Not all psychiatrists agree with it , but even those who do n't are nowadays stressing the role that aggression and destructive wishes play in human conduct ; as a result , most of them use Similar and strikingly effective technique of treatment for suicidal patients . From a child 's earliest days , explains Doctor Menninger , he displays both love and hate . At first , both emotions are directed toward himself , for his own body is the source of both good and bad sensations . Later he begins to see that these feelings are the results of outside forces and people , and he begins to transfer his emotions outward . Every parental restraint and command frustrates him to some extent , and the chummed L 's found out about her pareters 111111 when her kiratalittedher started braving Fiend al hicks , she fell I hid even I10110 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married and embarked upon II 11 adult life I hat most people wool ( ' agree held little joy and much sorrow . But only when all her difficulties seemed on I lie pond of disrsppeurtug Hiii ? gn into her suicidal depression . Why ? Because , says t he chief psychiatrist at Mrs. Collins ' hospital , " the buried feelings of rage against her parents and grandparents . nod the terrible sense of guilt at having such rage , had hem transformed into similar feelings about herself . But they had I ieen assuaged all her life by hard work and worry  --  the equivalent of punishment or expiation . When suddenly there was no punishment in daily life to allay the guilt and no hard work to use up the excess rage , she turned 1 these emotions inward and all but destroyed herself . " " Today I understand all this , " she says , " because of the psychiatric help I 've had . The incredible thing is how I thought that suicide was simply the most logical , intelligent thing to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illusion . " Next month Mrs. Collins goes home , and she 'll conic in once a week for continuing psychotherapy . Her major trouble is probably over for good . From his clinical experience with hundreds of suicidal patients in the Menninger Clinic , the Winter VA l-tospital and the Topeka State Hospital , Dr. Karl Menninger has also concluded  --  as he first theorized fifteen years ago in Man Against Hirnsetf ? that there generally are three distinct elements in a suicide al tempt : a wish to kill someone else lgggressions a wish to he killed ( that is. to he punished 1 . and a wish In die rthe death instincts . When only one or two of these are present . the attempt is generally a failure , and deliheretely so . Some weeks ago , for instance , a twenty-one-yea r-old girl crawled onto a window sill of a five-story building in Oakland , California , and screamed that she was going to jump . She spat on the crowd below , tore shreds of her clothing and shrieked out a stream of threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and police had failed , but even then it took several burly officers to restrain her from further violence . Her wish to " end it all , " interpreted in the light of the Menninger theory , was really a seething hatred of others turned against the only nonresisting person at hand ? herself . Yet in a way , the girl was making a plea : Someone please love me , help me to love ; this hate is hurting inc . For had she really wished to die , she could easily have jumped . The psychoanalytica l explanation of suicide also throws some light on a number of heretofore-haff ling statistical studies . For example , it is fairly certain that the national suicide rate decreases during wartime ? just when things are often worst . But , according to the aggression-turne d-within theory , this is perfectly natural . In wartime the blind , bottled-up aggressions which a man is ashamed to vent +in his family and friends , and not skillful enough to sublimate in his work or play , are given an outside focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , he hates himself  --  or the internalized equivalents of other people  --  that much less . It is a tragic paradox . Another statistical puzzler has been the odd inverse relationship between suicide and murder . It seemed , from various early studies , that there was less murder where there was more sui1 19 1ST cido , and vice versa . Yet . why should not both nets of violence be high in a violent society , and both be low in sa calm and orderly society ' ? Sociologist Austin Porterfield , of Texas Christian University , recently made some careful iinalyses of this very point , taking a number of American cities and states . The early studios proved to have had some truth in I hem ; Porterfield found that Alabama , for instance , rice , had only half as high a suicide rate as the entire nation , but two and a half times as high a murder rate . Vermont , had a higher suicide rate than the nation , but only one fifth the murder rate . M urders exceeded suicides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeded murders in most of the Nort hem cities . Portertield'a study lends excellent support to the psychiatric theory , for it seems to indicate that murder and suicide are opposite types of adjustment to a basic built-in aggressive drive in human beings . Our various classes and cultures condition us to express anger in different ways  --  either by acting it out against other people or things , or by turning it in upop ourselves . Still other puzzling facts about fticide no longer seem so mysterious to the psychiatrists . The family man is less likely to commit suicide , they say , because he has more external objects for his love instinct ? and sometimes , alas , for his hate instinct . There is more suicide among the wealthier and the better educated , not because wealth and education are harmful , but because such people are curbed and made more proper " in their aggressive desires by a different culture pattern . And how about the most mysterious of all suicides ? those committed by people who have just reached a pinnacle of success in something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Ross Lock-ridge ? To some people with keen aggressive drives that were originally directed against a fat her or brother , according to Doctor Menninger , the overactive conscience says , " success means you are robbing or displacing someone , or usurping the position once held by your envied baby brother or someone else in the family . " When good luck or hard work brings success to such a person , " the conscience reacts with a prohibition . and the wish to be killed develops in response to it . " Out of such current theorizing there has emerged some very practical therapeutic help for the suicidal . At the huge Winter VA Hospital where Doctor Menninger is chief consultant , doctors on the maximum-secu rity ward have for the last few years used a new technique with deeply depressed suicidal patients . instead of kindness and love , thedoctors treat them with tirmnessand a degree of severity , almost unfriendliness . At the same time , they prescribe long hours of such dull chores as floor scrubbing or sanding down of furniture . This kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to punish themselves by suicide . It also makes them thoroughly mad at the doctor . " And when the patient blows off and curses the doctor , " says Dr. Herbert Klemmer , chief of the Closed Active Intensive Treat ment Section at I he hospital , " his suicidal depression flies out the window and we have an enraged person on our hands instead . We 've had patients paint a doctor 's face on the punching bag on the porch , heal the stuffings out . of it , and be vastly im- proAvsedthae afterwar d. begins to talk out his anger , he becomes amenable to psycho ? , , , try h. teal thernpy or psychoanalysi s , which may help him unravel the source of his discontent . Through such psychotherap y , I he patient learns to re-evaluate himself , the people around him , and the meaning of his own feelings . Along with this mold important process of gaining insight go some specific physii- cal from slam the mop , the r block and the punching bag , he graduates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and learns to release aggressions in an acceptable way , Finally the patient is encouraged to divert his aggressive activity away from his loved ones altogether and channel it . into useful work . It may he anything from carpentry to playwriting , but it represents the culmination of the healthful development of man s aggression as well as his love instinct . Doctors at Winter VA Hospital , the Menninger Clinic and t he Topeka State Hospital also make generous use of medical methods , including insulin and electro-shock therapy . In the past few years these have revolutionize d the treat ment of about 25 per cent of euicidal patients . Why they magically dissolve certain kinds of psychotic depressions in less than a week no one knows . Perhaps they disrupt troublesome memories , perhaps they serve as symbolic punishment , relieving guilt . No one really knows , but shock treatment does work wonderfully in a number of Cases ' Yet , despite the progress that has been made in treating it , suicide is still largely an enigma . Doctor Menninger believes that one step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide a " reportable ? disease  --  one which the law requires , under penalty , to be reported by physicians to state hoards of health and to he accurately recorded . He would also like to see researchers or public-health workers assigned to the job of tracing the life histories of every suicide case and suicide attempter . " That would cost plenty of money , " he admits . " But if the public wants protection , it will have to be spent . " Research into suicide could follow a score of different lines of endeavor , if someone were willing to pay for it . One fertile field would be a study of ways to spot the pre-suicidal personality , for there still is not one reliable medical or psychological test that will pick out such persons . Even richer rewards might come from the point-by-point mapping out of those mistakes in child-rearing and family life which stunt the outward development of love and the normal channeling of aggression into valuable activity . Of the many external factors which seem to hear a predictable relation to suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family , the level of income , and so on  --  some , surely , must he significant rather than accidental . If any of these are truly meaningful , perhaps they , too , will show us unsuspected ways of reducing the rate of self-destructi on through social planning . Suicide is not only a matter of up to 50,000 lost lives each year . Many leading psychiatrists believe that the self-destructiv e impulse is also involved in at least half of our 9,400,000 annual nonfatal accidents ; that it plays a part in much of our psychosomatic disease , in cases of self-sacrifice to foolish or ignoble causes and in the unaccountable errors and forgetfulness that make so many people fail where others , no more intelligent , succeed . Like it or not , in short , suicide is more or less a part of the daily life of nearly us.
