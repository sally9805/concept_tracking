In the bedroom of a London home , dark-haired Dillon Usill , 31 , lay in labor , awaiting the birth of her first child . Counseling and assisting the patient was Dr. Grantly Dick Read , famed pioneer advocate of the " natural-childbirth " technique , which seeks to reduce the mother 's dependence on drugs through relaxation and elimination of fear . As in many births by the natural method , the prospective father was on hand , comforting and reassuring his wife-and , in this case , operating a tape recorder to pick up every bedside sound . From twelve hours of tape recorded during labor , Westminster Records last week released a 53-minute Long Playing disk ( Natural Childbirth ; $3.98 ) , reproducing in sound the high drama of life 's beginning . <P> The voice of Dr. Dick Read explains as the record begins that Mrs. Usill is nearing the end of the first stage of labor ; dilatation of the cervix , now almost complete , has been accomplished with little discomfort : " She is lying relaxed on her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the patient 's deep and rapid breathing signals the onset of each new contraction ; they are now coming three minutes apart . In a quiet moment , a microphone attached to the doctor 's stethoscope picks up the fetal heartbeat , amplified to thunderous volume . " That 's fine , " he remarks . " One hundred forty-five and going strong . " Between contractions , Mrs. Usill complains of hunger . " I could do with some honey , " she says , and it is brought . <P> As the infant begins its passage from the uterus , the doctor gently encourages the mother to push as hard as she is able to during contractions . " Many people with the first one do n't know how to push , " he explains . " You are not hurting ? " " Not at all , " says the resting patient . " It 's hard work ... I find it jolly tiring . . . Oh , let 's get on . I have another contraction , " <P> When the infant 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has a boy or a girl . " I ca n't tell , " the doctor replies . " That part is n't out yet . " Moments later , the shrill wail of young David Usill rises above the murmur of the bedside sounds . " Oh , doctor , " breathes the mother , " that 's beautiful . "
