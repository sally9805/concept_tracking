Should the Virgin Mary be referred to as the Mother or the Mama of Jesus Christ ? This question , while not the major issue in the controversy , was nevertheless one irritant in the latest quarrel between the Vatican and the French Roman Catholic Church . Long suspicious of French " progressive Catholicism , " the Vatican finally cracked down on a matter that seemed less dramatic than the ill-fated Red-tinged Worker Priest movement ( TIME , May 13 ) , but was perhaps even closer to rank and file French Catholics . The issue : a " progressive catechism . " which replaced the old , stodgy National Catechism throughout France last year . The new catechism tries to teach the tenets of the Catholic faith not by rote but through simple logic , slogans and cartoons . <P> To progressive Catholics the catchy new booklets are a means of winning children who otherwise would all too easily drift away ( said one agnostic Paris mother : " It 's dynamite . If my children got hold of that , they 'd all be Catholics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vatican 's Holy Office , it is a wrenching departure from tradition , alarming both by its content and the mood that produced it-so much so that the Vatican ordered it withdrawn , reportedly called on its author , Lyon-born Canon Joseph Colomb , to resign . <P> Drumbeat Repetition . The old National Catechism phrased its lessons in adult language , relied on drumbeat repetition to teach difficult concepts that children later might grow to understand : " Was the Blessed Virgin preserved from original sin ? Yes , the Blessed Virgin was preserved from original sin . This is why we say that she was conceived without sin . " The new catechism 's verse presentation is designed for emotional appeal : <P> <P> The Good God has said : <P> I will send you my Son . <P> He will tell you what you should do . <P> The Good God has prepared for his Son <P> A Mama . <P> A Mama without any sin . <P> A Mama all beautiful . <P> The old catechism on the Eucharist : " What is the Eucharist ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blood , soul and divinity of Jesus Christ under the appearance of bread and wine . " New version : <P> When Jesus is on the altar In the form of bread , He invites me to receive him . My soul desires you , O Jesus . <P> The Catchisme Progressif avoids complex dogma , presents simple concepts first , seeks to initiate more involved theology gradually . Many points are emphasized with cartoons , e.g. , Jean , who has ignored the instructions of the auto dealer , has just overturned his car , while Jacques , who paid attention , is pictured put-putting happily by on his motor bike . Moral by analogy : " I have faith in God ; I ought to obey his law . " <P> Gradual Truth . Conservative Catholics have argued that the new method might teach children harmful " speculative tendencies . " Protested one pamphlet : " Give the children the proper words . Later they will understand . " The Holy Office finally agreed : " There can not be gradual teaching of the truth . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
