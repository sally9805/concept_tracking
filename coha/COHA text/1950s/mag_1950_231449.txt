Lonely Bahrein Island , off the east coast of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf , is a hot , humid desert , inhabited mostly by Arabian pearl divers and British and American oil drillers . Its airport on nearby Muharrak Island is a stopover for Air France planes on the Saigon-Paris run , and French pilots do n't particularly like it : the weather in the Gulf is treacherous , and within minutes fine flying weather can become a horror of sandstorms , torrential rains or typhoons . <P> One night last week , the weather around Bahrein was in one of its ugliest moods . A sandstorm scoured the airdrome and blotted visibility down to three-quarters of a mile as an Air France DC-4 , carrying 43 passengers and a crew of eight on the regular Saigon-Paris run , called the field for landing instructions . At 1:15 a.m. the man in the tower signaled his O.K. , waited for his first glimpse of the DC-4 's landing lights . Forty minutes later , still waiting , he called for the rescue teams . Toward dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight bodies , and the plane itself . It had crashed in twelve feet of water , two miles off the island , obviously on its final approach to the runway . <P> Two nights later the sandstorm still raged , and a second DC-4 was lost Like the first plane , it was also on the final approach to the airstrip . It plunged into the sea within a mile of the first . The passengers who got out clung to the tail , and then , as the plane sank , to its broken aerial wire . Total loss in the two crashes : 85 lives . <P> Within hours of the first crash , a French government commission was on the way to Bahrein to investigate . It was headed by Maurice Bellonte , of the famed Coste-Bellonte team which flew nonstop from Paris to New York in 1930 . There were rumors that in each crash the altimeter was faulty , but an early report from Airman Bellonte said that in the second plane at least , the instruments were " in good working order . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tragic coincidence ? Paris newspapers did not think so , darkly hinted at sabotage . They pointed out that the first plane carried Henri Maux , French government official returning to Paris from strife-torn Indo-China with important documents which he had prepared for an interstate conference between Viet Nam , Cambodia and Laos . Scheduled for June 26 , the conference had to be postponed as a result of Maux 's death . Also on the first plane : Raymond Rivet of the French Ministry of Finance . Rivet carried with him a full report on drug peddling , smuggling , and the dollar black market in Saigon . <P> While the investigation continued , Air France discontinued all night landings at Bahrein.
