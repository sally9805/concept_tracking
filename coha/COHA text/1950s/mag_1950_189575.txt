The bells of the Kremlin tolled the May Day hour ( 10 a.m. ) as Joseph Stalin , in fawn uniform and chipper mood , stood on Lenin 's marble tomb to take the adulation of a million marchers . His son , Lieut . General Vasily Stalin , flew above Red Square in the van of the mightiest Soviet air show ; there were 64 four-engined bombers where last November there had been 22 . " Comrades , " orated Chief of Staff General S. M. Shtemenko , on the rostrum beside Stalin , " a crisis is approaching in capitalist countries . . . " <P> The sense of crisis was most acute in Berlin , where two worlds faced each other balefully . Half a million German comrades paraded in the Soviet zone , held high the images of their master Stalin . Three-quarters of a million gathered in the Western zone to cheer anti-Communist speakers . Between opposing camps ranged a thin line of police and occupation troops . At Potsdamer Platz , demonstrators surged from the Allied toward the Soviet sector , hurling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " Communist pigs ! " They were promptly dispersed by West German police . <P> Warsaw watched 600,000 march . Prague staged its celebration in historic Wenceslaus Square , where citizens had wept when the Nazis swept in . Paris had a divided holiday-a traditional left-wing parade and a rival Gaullist music festival . Rome listened to speeches in the jampacked Piazza del Popolo . Peking 's 200,000 celebrants chanted " Long live Sino-Soviet alliance ! " <P> A third world held jubilee in Belgrade . There the Yugoslav comrades , led by Marshal Tito , cheered for the people 's revolution and independent Communism , promenaded under the portraits of Marx , Engels and Lenin . Nowhere was there any picture of Stalin .
