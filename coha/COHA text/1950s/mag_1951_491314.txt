baseball you sometimes are better off just taking a success story at its face value . If you get very far beneath the surface , you may be disillusioned . This is not the case , however , with Jim Konstanty , whose remarkable relief pitching made the difference for the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1950 National League pennant race . Here the deeper you dig , the more impressive the story becomes . It You find there is much more to it than the central fact that Konstanty , after years of being just another minor-league pitcher , suddenly turned into a big-league star at the advanced age of thirty-three . Go back a bit and you discover that at twenty-two Jim could n't make the grade with an independent club or win a pitching job on his college team . Go back still further and you learn that he had to work his way not merely through college but through high school . Back when he was sixteen , Jim and a younger brother were on their own , occupying a rented room in the lodgings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were other periods in Jim 's boyhood when the family had little or nothing to eat . The Konstanty story is Cinderella all the way . It also is one of baseball 's prize case histories of a self-made man . In Konstanty 's development as a pitcher there is a real believe-it-or-not twist . His coach was , and is , a non-ballplaying friend back home  --  the local undertaker . In any field the man who comes up the hard route is apt to be an ultra-aggressive personality with a lot of rough edges . Jim Konstanty is not that type . A solid 200-pounder of six feet one and a half inches whose good looks are somewhat obscured by his glasses , he is forthright but unassuming in manner . He has a light , deprecating way of talking about himself and his pitching . At businessmen 's luncheons over the winter in Oneonta , New York , where he operates a sporting-goods store , he is indistinguishable from any other personable , poised young entrepreneur . However , Jim Konstanty is a basically serious-minded fellow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Continued on Page 97 ) // ( Cont ' NI from Page 25 ) so exhaustively into the mechanics of their craft or set themselves such a strict code of daily living . You find this intense career-mindedness in many of the players who become stars . In Konstanty 's case it has transformed him from a pitcher of ordinary ability into a standout . A relief pitcher has to be spectacular to make the baseball headlines , as was demonstrated by Jim 's own experience in 1949 , his first full season in the majors . Konstanty was right up with the Cardinals ' Ted Wilks among the National League relief specialists that year , yet attracted so little attention that he was not even listed in the next edition of Who 's Who in Baseball . Konstanty 's 1950 record , however , was so extraordinary that nobody could overlook it . Jim pitched in almost half the Phillies ' games in 1950 , and figured in nearly half their victories . He appeared in a total of seventy-four league games , breaking Ace Adams ' modern record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finishing pitcher , breaking Clint Brown 's all-time record of fifty-six . Jim was in there for as little as one pitch , and for as much as ten innings . In the 151 innings he worked he allowed only 109 hits , an unusually low ratio , and yielded just forty-nine runs , both earned and unearned ? an average of less than three per nine innings . He was credited with sixteen wins and seven defeats . In addition to his sixteen official victories , there were twenty-four other games in which he preserved a Phillies ' lead . Since the Phils captured only ninety-one games all told in 1950 , finishing first by a scant two-game margin , it was obvious that the Whiz Kids could not have won the pennant without the veteran Konstanty . He was the overwhelming choice as the National League 's most valuable player of the year . He also made a brief but brilliant appearance in the All-Star Game . Finally  --  the most fictionlike touch of all  --  this Cinderella man switched from relieving to starting in the opening game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who needed a superb performance from Vic Raschi to squeeze out a 1-0 win . How does Konstanty do it ? Other great relief pitchers have had dazzling stuff  --  Joe Page , of the Yankees , with his fast sinker ; Firpo Marberry , of the Washington Senators , with his speed ; Ted Wilks with his fine curve . Konstanty , however , operates with an assortment of what is politely known as junk . His teasing deliveries have the batters fairly weeping with frustration . " You could catch his fastest pitch between your teeth , " Leo Durocher declared in exasperation after his New York Giants had flailed away futilely at Konstanty 's tosses one afternoon last summer . " He could hit you on the nose with his hardest pitch and not bruise the skin , " said one of Konstanty 's 1950 teammates , the veteran pitcher , Blix Donnelly . But Donnelly continued , " His control is terrific . His poise is tremendous . He is so effective it is almost unbelievable . " Some of the hardest hitters in the National League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public became aware of him  --  men like Ralph Kiner , of the Pirates ; Enos Slaughter , of the Cards ; Hank Sauer , of the Cubs ; and Jackie Robinson , of the Dodgers . Konstanty has an unexceptional fast ball  --  he uses it strictly as a come-on , according to Catcher Andy Seminick ? and an unexceptional curve . But he has perfected a couple of unorthodox deliveries  --  the slider and the palm ball  --  and he has developed precision control . He mixes them up . He pitches to spots . Most of all , he consistently keeps the batters off on their timing . Konstanty is a big righthander with a big windup who looks as though he is going to blaze away with the ball . . . but does n't . The slider is a pitch which just " moves over " as it nears the plate , in contrast to the standard curve , which breaks down as well as out . But the Konstanty slider appears to cross up hitters who are used to seeing the regulation sharp-breaking stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? floats up with no spin . Seating the ball between his ring finger , little finger and thumb , with index and middle fingers resting lightly on top , and exerting some slight pressure with the finger joints close to the palm , he achieves an effect like that of the knuckle ball . . " It never comes up there , " Ralph Kiner says of the Konstanty palm ball . " You start your swing , and when you 're halfway through , the ball is still out there near the mound . " Technicalities aside , Konstanty adds up to a supreme example of a fellow who pitches more with his head than with his arm . He has a dedicated approach to the business of being a ballplayer . One of your aTuthors , who travels regularly with the Phillies , has never seen Jim smoke or drink . Although Jim gets along with everybody , he keeps pretty much to himself on the road . He seldom goes out at night , even to the movies . Jim passes most of his time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading  --  mostly novels and business texts . Konstanty did not begin to develop into a real pitching craftsman until he was nearly thirty , and he was another couple of years working up to the Phillies . He knows he does n't have much time to cash in . He is a solid family man , with what are universally described as " a wonderful wife and two swell kids " ? James Edward , eight , and Helen Irene , six . He does n't want things to be as tough for them as they sometimes were during his own boyhood . Jim was one of six children of John and Apolonia Konstanty , a Polish couple who emigrated to the United States , first settling near Strykersvilie , New York . Jim  --  the full name is Casimer James Konstanty  --  was born there on March 3 , 1917 . Father Konstanty farmed for a while without much success , and then moved to Buffalo , going to work in the steel mills , where he did much better . However , city life did not appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide open spaces in Poland . She induced her husband to Euy a hotel in the farming community of Delevan , New York . Delevan had a baseball team , and Jim displayed such a knack for retrieving foul balls that he was made bat boy and taken along on trips as a ball chaser . At twelve he started playing American Legion junior baseball as a shortstop . But this was a bitter period for the Konstantys . Business was poor , money was scarce . The family savings melted away . The worst blow was the death of Jim 's mother , who passed away in 1926 , soon after the purchase of the hotel . Jim 's father , who lived until 1949 , remarried several years after the mother 's death . His second wife was a widow with four children of her own who had a farm a few miles away , at Arcade , New York . They all moved in together , and things got even tougher , as Jim recalls it . " We had a few cows , but the milk was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " Sometimes we got half a cup a day . Most of the time we lived on cabbage , potatoes , cabbage , potatoes . The only clothing I had was a pair of overalls and an old shirt . " Jim went through his first year of high school in Delevan , thumbing or walking the seven miles back and forth from Arcade each day . He went out for the baseball team and made it as a pitcher with a sidearm roundhouse curve . The next year he transferred to Arcade High , played first base and pitched on the baseball team . He was captain and center in basketball , and a halfback in soccer . Meanwhile the farm continued to be a bust . By the time Jim 's junior year came around , his father decided he 'd had enough of the country , and moved to Buffalo . Jim and a younger brother , John , decided to stay in Arcade and struggle along by themselves . They rented a room and cooking privileges in a flat occupied by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol and survived on it . " We never saw him eat , " remembers Jim . " He just lined up the bottles for us to stumble over . , I got a job keeping fires at the Borden Milk plant . I made twenty-five cents an hour , and that kept John and me . We ate beans , spaghetti and soup . We had no dishes , so we ate out of the cans and threw the cans away . I owned the one white shirt in the family , but every time I wanted to put it on and go to the movies , I 'd find my brother had worn it to a date . " Jim 's eyes began to go back on him at that time . He had strained them , reading Wild West yarns by candlelight in Delevan . The principal noticed him squinting one day , sent him to an oculist and got him a pair of glasses . He has been wearing glasses ever since . In his senior year at Arcade High things brightened a bit . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George Montgomery , who had played on the Delevan team with Jim , moved into Arcade , and Jim lived with him . His brother John moved in with other folks . Later in the winter the basketball coach , Dan S. Collister , arranged for William McNair , a manufacturer and great basketball fan , to keep Jim , his brother and two other boys . By the next fall Jim had saved $150 and wanted to go to college . Collister arranged a half scholarship for him at Syracuse University , and McNair took him to the bank and went his note for another $150 . McNair acted as a father to him during the next four years , advising him in money matters , taking him back to Arcade during Christmas and other holidays . Jim 's years at Syracuse were busy , hard ones , working , playing sports and studying as a physical-education major . He washed dishes and waited on tables at Winchel Hall for his meals , fired boilers and swept downtown offices for room money . The first two summer vacations he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next summer he went to Smithville to play ball and work . At Syracuse he was on the baseball , basketball and soccer teams . Because Jim had a strong arm , Coach Lew Carr made him a third baseman . In his junior year Jim went out for the pitching staff , but Carr discouraged it . " You ca n't pivot right for a pitcher , " said Carr . " You do n't whirl enough . " So Jim went back to third base . In his senior year he worked out with the boxing squad for fun . " We had some good heavyweights , but they froze ' every time they got into a real ring , " says Jim . " So the coach got me to come out for the team . I whipped a Coast Guardsman my first bout , and then the coach entered me in the interc , ollegiates . Harry Stella , of the Army , was my first bout . He weighed 225 . I scaled 175 . I could n't even hold his arms up . The coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Konstanty 's last fight . " After getting out of college  --  he graduated in 1939 and did postgraduate work the next year  --  Jim became a two-career man . Winters he was a high-school coach and gym instructor . Summers he was a ballplayer . For a long time Konstanty was a very obscure ballplayer indeed . In 1939 he failed to stick as a first baseman with Malone , New York , in the Northern League ? the independent circuit in which young Robin Roberts , the ace starter of the Phils , later pitched . In 1940 , helped by a letter of recommendation from his Syracuse coach ? " Not much ability , but a lot of hustle , " the letter said ? he got another Northern League trial with Massena , New York . Manager George Miner put Jim in the outfield and used him to pitch to the batters in hitting practice . There he showed so much stuff that Miner turned him into a pitcher . His work with Massena led to an offer from the Syracuse Chiefs , of the International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League during 1941 . Jim lost thirteen games by one run , was shut out five times , and finished the season with a top-heavy record of four wins and nineteen losses . There was one consolation for Jim that year . It was a big one . On May twenty-seventh he was married to Mary Burlingame , an attractive young history teacher he had met and fallen in love with during the winter while working at St. Regis Falls High School . For the first few years of his married life , Jim continued in the same job cycle . Each fall he would go back to physical-education work in New York  --  at Cherry Creek in 1941 , at Westfield in 1942 and 1943 . Each spring he would decide to give baseball one more try . Pitching for Syracuse in 1942 , he got in only five games and had only one decision  --  an important victory over Newark which put the Chiefs in the championship play-offs . In 1943 his record was eight and twelve . At contract time in 1944 , disgusted at his failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up the game and concentrate on his teaching . Leo Miller , the Syracuse business manager , not only upped Konstanty 's salary to more than $400 a month but told him that there was a chance of his being bought by Cincinnati . This changed Jim 's mind . He won eight out of fourteen decisions during the first months of the season at Syracuse , including a hot streak in which he took six straight , but his sale to Cincinnati did not materialize . When Konstanty asked about it , he was given another raise , but told that the club had been unable to put through the sale . , Jim wrote a complaint to Commissioner Landis . Within two weeks he was at Cincinnati , where he won six and lost four during the balance of the season . In 1945 he was out of baseball , serving in the Navy at Sampson Naval Training Station . He was discharged in December , and went through 1946 spring training with Cincinnati at Tampa . The day the season opened the Reds sent Konstanty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Boston , Jim thought he should have a raise . " So I asked Billy South-worth for a boost , and to make it sound better , I dropped the remark that I had two offers from the Mexican League  --  which I did n't . " ' See me tomorrow , ' said Billy . At ten o'clock the next morning I had a call from the office . ' That 's quick work , ' I said to myself , and walked in . General Manager John Quinn handed me a slip . It was a release to Toronto . " Konstanty had stayed in Boston long enough to pitch only fifteen innings  --  he had one defeat and no victories  --  and now he was back in the minors . He went on to a sour season at Toronto , winning four and losing nine . When Jim got home to Worcester , New York , that fall , he fully intended to get out of baseball for good and stake out some other career . Instead he wound upundergoing a virtual rebirth as a pitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Andrew Skinner , came in . Andy Skinner is one of the most improbable advisers any big-leaguer ever had . He was n't a ballplayer himself . He did n't know the first thing about pitching until he started working with Konstanty . Yet by Jim 's own testimony , Skinner has had a lot to do with perfecting the present Konstanty technique . He is still the man to whom Jim turns for help when he loses his touch . It started soon after Jim came home in the autumn of 1946 . He had signed to play a pro-basketball game , and invited Skinner to come along with him . Because his baseball difficulties were uppermost in his mind , Konstanty began to talk about pitching . He mentioned that he had been experimenting with a slider , but had n't had much luck with it . Skinner is a fellow with an uncommonly analytical mind and a yen for getting to the bottom of things . He had made himself a good bowler by the book , studying the basic principles of twist and spin and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Konstanty with his slider ? although , he confesses , he had never even heard of the slider before . He invited Konstanty to work on it with him in a local gym , and Konstanty , in a nothing-to-lose spirit , agreed . Skinner went to the library and studied a book on pitching before keeping his date in the gym . " Before we start , " he told Konstarity , " let me see how you hold the ball . Where do you put your fingers ? Why do you put your thumb there ? " Konstanty was puzzled . " I o n't know , " he said . " I 've always frown them that way . " Skinner shook his head in mock dis-g- ust " That 's the trouble . You do n't think . You do n't know why the ball breaks certain ways . You do n't know about building up wind resistance . It 's just like building up friction resistance on a bowling alley . Now let 's start thinking . " Skinner and Konstanty had session after session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimenting with different grips . Finally he arrived at his present effective delivery , in which he puts his thumb on the seam , and holds the ball an inch off center between his fingers . The ball is thrown overhand , and it slides away from right-handed batters . This was the beginning of a unique relationship which continues to this day . From the slider , Skinner and Konstanty moved on to control  --  pin-point control . Skinner 's basic contribution probably has been to stimulate Jim to a perfectionist attitude toward pitching . Konstanty now has everything in his repertoire down to a fine point . The palm ball , for instance , is not only a deceptive change-of-pace pitch but one which  --  with varying overhand and side-arm deliveries  --  he can cause to break down or to either side . The Konstanty-Skinner combination functions in season as well as out . At Toronto in 1947 and again in 1948 , when Jim hit a bad spell , he got Skinner to come up and see what he was doing wrong . In 1949 , when Konstanty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a high hill near Oneonta . Although he was supposedly out of range , he was able to get the baseball telecasts from Philadelphia on days of heavy fog . When the Phils were in New York it was easier . Skinner called Konstanty at New York 's Hotel Commodore one night . " You were too careful with Campanella today , " he told him . " He ca n't hit your slider unless you get in the hole . " Later , after watching Jim hurl against the Giants , he reported , " Your motion was perfect today , but try to come a little higher with your arm on the slider . " In 1950 , after an impressive one-inning appearance in the All-Star Game ? he fanned Hoot Evers and Jim Regan , and got Bobby Doerr on a bounder  --  Konstanty hit a mild slump . Again he called Skinner , and Skinner came down to Philadelphia to help him get back to form . So it has gone . Jim 's improvement after 1946 was gradual . In fact , to many observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Toronto in 1947 , and a ten-ten record in 1948 , without knocking anybody 's eyes out . One of the few people he did impress was Eddie Sawyer , then the Phillies ' top farm manager , who stepped in at Toronto in 1948 when the Phils negotiated a working agreement with the Maple Leafs . After Sawyer moved up to the Phillies in late summer , he astonished both the Philadelphia and Toronto managements by asking for Konstanty as one of the two men the Phils were entitled to claim under their working agreement . Sawyer had a hunch that Konstanty , with his deceptive soft stuff and gilt-edged control , would be highly effective in relief of the fireballing young pitchers around whom the Whiz Kids were building . Konstanty came up at the tag end of 1948 , appeared in a total of ten innings , and allowed only one run . The following spring , however , he was hit hard in exhibition games . In his first regular-season appearance on April twentieth he was hammered for four hits and two runs in two innings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him for the same total in just two thirds of an inning . But Sawyer stuck with him , and eventually Jim began to click . His top performance was in a game at the Polo Grounds . " We were a run ahead in the ninth , we 'd only scored the run that inning , " Sawyer has related . " The Giants came up and filled the bags with none out and had Bobby Thomson , Willard Marshall and Sid Gordon on deck . Konstanty went in . And how ! He got Thomson on a pop up , struck Marshall out and made Gordon pop up . " Konstanty , who has yet to start a National League game for the Phils , was none too happy at first about being a relief pitcher . He said he would relieve only for a manager like Sawyer , who fully appreciated what the job involved . Jim figured that the big headlines and the big money went to starting pitchers . The great 1949 success of Yankee relief ace Joe Page caused Konstanty to take heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he worked in fifty-three games , was credited with nine victories , saved a dozen additional contests , and was tagged with only five losses . In 1950 , despite a stubborn spring holdout , he signed for a base pay probably less than $10,000 , plus a bonus if home attendance went over 1,000,000 ? which it did . It is believed that he asked for , and got , a better contract before the end of the season . Konstanty 's 1951 salary demands no doubt will be sizable . He will have some strong talking points . His 1950 record stacks up favorably against the best years of the best relief pitchers , including the fabulous 1927 season of Wiley Moore . Moore was a venerable surprise package who won nineteen and lost seven for the Yankees that year , pitching mostly , although not entirely , in relief . It would take a small catalogue to detail all the occasions in 1950 when the thirty-three-year-old Konstanty came in to save the day for the Whiz Kids . He had some bad spells , of course ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard in four out of five appearances . Then there was the unhappy Fourth of July game in which the Boston Braves , trailing 9-8 , loaded the bases on Jim in the ninth and won out on a grand-slam home run by Sid Gordon . But most of the time Konstanty was a stopper . His hottest streak was from July nineteenth , to August thirtieth . He appeared in seventeen games , pitched a total of thirty-eight innings  --  including the last nine of a fifteen-inning affair at Pittsburgh ? and was charged with only a single run . Jim Konstanty has an ideal temperament for a relief pitcher . He has sold himself on the idea that when he steps into a tight situation it is the batter who has to worry , not Konstanty . He gives his wife , Mary , credit for making him that way . " I used to alibi myself too much , " he says . " I 'd come home after losing a tough one and say , ' If the second baseman had n't fumbled that ball in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , If the ump had n't missed that third strike on Joe Doakes , they 'd never have beaten me . ' " Mary would listen patiently . Then she 'd ask , ' But what about the fellow who was already on base and scored the run that beat you ? How did he get on ? If you had been more careful with him you would n't have been in trouble . ' " She was right . She taught me not to pass the buck . Today when I go out there I tell myself that I 'm the boss  --  that if I throw the right pitches in the right places no one will get a hit . I do n't believe in the law of averages  --  that a hitter is due to get a certain number of hits and a pitcher a certain number of defeats . When I lose , it 's because I make mistakes . " The lone run off Konstanty in the World Series opener stemmed from a hit which looked somewhat fluky . It was a grounder off the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left-field line for a double . However , one of the assembled experts , Pittsburgh Manager Billy Meyer , said after the game , " You have to give Brown credit . He did what the hitters always try to do against Konstanty ? hit him to the opposite field . " Jim himself waved aside all alibis . " It was bad pitching , " he said . " The ball got away from me . " No ballplayer gets the hero treatment in his own clubhouse . Teammates kid Jim about his conviction that pitching can be reduced to an exact science , and about his " nothing-ball " assortment . Deep down , Konstanty has an artisan 's pride in his work , but he has learned to ride along with the gags . His stock answer to reporters who ask him what he has is , " I throw a junk ball . " Only if it becomes clear that you are genuinely interested in getting an understanding of his technique does he open up . It is then that you begin to appreciate his round-the-clock absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is always careful about what he eats , always careful to get enough sleep . In every pre-game workout he runs seven laps around the park or the equivalent . " If your legs are strong your arm never gets tired , " Jim declares . He never has had a sore arm . Frank Wiechec , the Phillies ' trainer , says that Konstanty 's muscles seldom show signs of fatigue . In the bull pen Konstanty has a set routine . Warm-up mounds are often rather makeshift affairs , but Jim got the Phillies to put in one exactly like the regular Shibe Park mound . When the call comes for him to warm up ; he relaxes his arm , shoulders and body , flexes his wrists , then starts tossing the ball to the catcher at a short distance . With each toss he steps back a stride . When he reaches the full pitching distance he throws twenty hard pitches . Then he practices his slider , his palm ball , his control . In a game he works deliberately , but with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but varies them as circumstances dictate . He shifts from one side of the rubber to the other to get better pitching angles on certain batters . He makes anxious batters wait while he " double pumps " ? goes up and down twice with his arms  --  during his windup . He does n't overpower the opposition  --  although he averages better than three strike-outs per nine innings  --  but they seldom get the fat of the bat on his pitches . The batters who give him the most trouble are the punch hitters , fellows like Gene Mauch , of Boston , and Al Dark , of New York , who stand up , wait for the pitch and push it to right field . After the game he records the details of his performance in a notebook . He always has his exact record on the tip of his tongue  --  innings pitched , earned runs , bases on balls , strike-outs , games won and lost , games saved for other hurlers . Former Brooklyn Manager Burt Shotton once said , " Give me nine players who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pennant . " It was in the same painstaking and methodical fashion that Jim went into the sporting-goods business . This was an idea he had begun to think about while he was in the Navy during 1995 . He wanted something more lucrative than physical-education work to turn to in the winters and after his pitching days were over . He spent much of his spare time in the Navy studying books ( on business operation  --  management , bookkeeping , merchandising . After the 1947 season , he decided that it was time to start his store . Worcester , where he lives , was n't big enough to support it ; he finally chose Oneonta , a nearby town of 12,000 , and opened in February of 1948 . The venture was hardly launched before Jim had to leave for spring training with Toronto . Mary ran the store that first summer , and got it off to a good start . Nowadays they leave it in other hands during the summer , and Mary and the children spend the season with Jim in the Philadelphia suburbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that he knew nothing about running a store when he started , but he was willing to learn , and has worked hard . He has developed various markets , such as selling equipment to the smaller high schools ; having been a small-budget high-school coach himself , he knows their problems . Jim had various job offers for this winter after his big 1950 season ? $2500 for a baseball barnstorming trip , a student-interviewing post with Syracuse University , a goodwill job with a liquor distributor . But he passed them all up , to stick to his store and to his workouts with Andy Skinner , who said , " This year we 'll have to get you a fast ball . " The 1950 season was the one in which , after years of unrewarded struggle , everything began going Jim Konstanty 's way . His top thrill was the World Series . Although the Phillies lost four straight to the Yankees , Konstanty showed up very well , pitching a total of fifteen innings , and yielding only four runs . Konstanty 's selection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to everyone else . However , Manager Eddie Sawyer insists that Jim was the only logical choice . " Jim had proved during the season that he could go the distance , " Sawyer says . " One time he went nine innings against Pittsburgh , and another time he went ten against Cincinnati . For the series we did n't want to start Robin Roberts . He had started four games in nine days , with only two days since the last one , and we knew he 'd be better with another day 's rest . Curt Simmons was gone . Bob Miller and Bubba Church were hurt in September and had n't got back in form . It had to be either Konstanty or Heintzelman . " It was one of the easiest spots Jim had all year , " adds Sawyer . " This was one of the few times he went into a game when there was n't anybody on base . "
