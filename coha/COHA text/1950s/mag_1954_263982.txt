On a cool February evening in 1888 Scottish Veterinarian John Boyd Dunlop watched his small son pedal a tricycle along a Belfast street and into history . For the rear wheels of the boy 's tricycle Dunlop had fashioned hollow rubber-and-canvas tubes pumped full of air-two of the world 's earliest pneumatic tires . Within two years pneumatic tires were the rage of Britain 's cyclists , and Dunlop was busy trying to fill the demand . <P> From these modest beginnings Dunlop Rubber Co. , Ltd. has grown into a mammoth holding company with 165 subsidiaries , 66,000 stockholders and 93,000 employees . Its 61 factories ( 23 outside the United Kingdom ) turn out golf balls , tennis balls , foam rubber , tires , tubes , ' raincoats ; its Malayan rubber plantations ( 92,800 acres ) are the biggest private landholdings in the British Commonwealth . With 1953 sales of $680 million ( and a net of $14 million ) , Dunlop completely dominates the Commonwealth market for rubber goods . Dunlop , in fact , is often called a microcosm of the Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dunlop 's empire is big ( 6 ft. , 200 Ibs. ) , grey-haired George Edward Beharrell , 55 . In his realm he finds one flaw : Dunlop sales rank but fifth in the U.S.* Last week George Beharrell made a big move to correct this flaw . He announced that Dunlop will spend $5,500,000 to modernize its plant at Buffalo and streamline its U.S. sales organization . <P> Exit Dunlop . While Scotland 's John Dunlop first thought of putting his pneumatic tires on bicycles , it took an Irishman to gaze into the spinning wheels and see a fortune . Dublin Paper Merchant Harvey Du Cros , father of three famed bicycle racers , needed only to see his sons beaten by a man on Dunlop tires before he set to work . He promptly organized a tire company , persuaded Dunlop to join him , and with classic forethought predicted in his prospectus : " The pneumatic tyre will be almost indispensable for ladies and persons with delicate nerves . " <P> With the stamina of six-day bicycle racers , Harvey Du Cros and his sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continent , them the U.S. They built new factories in France , Germany , and Canada ; in seven " years the company was reorganized with $24 million capital , and John Dunlop sold his interest . <P> Enter Macintosh . At the dawn of the auto age , the company started its own rubber plantations in Malaya , bought textile mills to guarantee supplies of tire fabrics . But Dunlop expanded too fast , was caught in 1921 's commodity collapse with a disastrously big inventory of rubber . The Du Cros regime was ousted . In went Sir Eric Geddes and Sir George Beharrell , a brilliant management team . <P> At Dunlop , Sir Eric and Sir George swung the ax ruthlessly , began to diversify . They bought more wheel and rim plants , started making all kinds of rubber goods , from flooring to hot water bottles , and took over Charles Macintosh &; Co. , of raincoat fame . In 1928 Sir George hired his son , George Beharrell. who rose to a directorship in 1942.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
