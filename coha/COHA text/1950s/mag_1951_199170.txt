When Laurence Olivier &; Vivien Leigh decided to do Shaw 's Caesar and Cleopatra for last summer 's Festival of Britain , Stage Designer Roger Furse jokingly suggested that they do Shakespeare 's Antony and Cleopatra as well . They smiled at the idea but were quickly haunted by it ; and in due time the two Cleopatras became the sensation of the festival . Long before they opened in Manhattan last week , to rave reviews and a $900,000 advance , they had become a Broadway sensation as well . <P> The thing was such a bright idea , it comes off such a brilliant stunt , it boasts in the Oliviers so much added aura , that the superlatives ca n't help spilling over into what should be more temperate zones . The productions have their admirable virtues ; the stars have their expected lure . But this is no such event as was Olivier 's Oedipus Rex on his last visit to Broadway . And far from blotting out a recent Caesar on Broadway ( with Cedric Hardwicke and Lilli Palmer ) or a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present productions will be constantly-and not always favorably - compared to the earlier ones . What is really important is doing two such plays together . Shaw 's emerges as so good that what should be stressed is how vividly it differs from Shakespeare 's rather than how it necessarily falls short . It sets some of the sharpest prose in the modern theater against some of the greatest poetry of all time ; Caesar underscores the impotence of wisdom where Antony dramatizes the tragedy of folly . <P> Kitten on the Sphinx . On the first of the two nights , audiences saw a Cleopatra who was a mere frisking kitten with claws . <P> Caesar is the central thing in Caesar and Cleopatra , the central thing for Cleopatra herself . The musing middle-aged stranger she addresses , between the paws of the Sphinx , as " Old gentleman , " keeps her his doting pupil in queenship , but will not risk his heart . A Roman eagle Caesar is , but like the eagle , bald , and wearing a laurel wreath as a toupee . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he knows too well that the only true conqueror is the conqueror worm . Caesar is that type that always fascinated Shaw , the successful man of action . And Shaw molded Caesar nearer to his mind 's desire : made him notable not for warmth but for lack of heat , not for humanity but for hate of inhumanity . <P> Yet the resemblances between this Caesar and Shaw mean less than the differences between this Caesar and actual Caesarism . This Caesar 's is roughly a philosophy of Right Needs Might , but the philosophy is not , with him , a pretext for dictatorship . Shaw 's Caesar , if not history 's , has no other course for checking the violence , the will-to-rule , the lust-to-kill of everybody-the young Cleopatra not least-he encounters . Indeed , the exultantly upraised swords and the hysterical shouts of " Hail Caesar " at the final curtain are less Caesar 's moment of triumph than of defeat . The voice of reason is always drowned out , all too soon will " Ave , Caesar " become " Et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
