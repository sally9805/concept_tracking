In the Page One furor about Senator Joe McCarthy 's " blockade by subpoena , " there was a rapid changing of tunes last week . Originally , the Wisconsin Senator boldly announced that he had succeeded where the State Department had failed : his investigating subcommittee had " negotiated " an agreement with Greek shipowners to prevent 242 merchant vessels from carrying cargoes to Communist ports . In answer , Mutual Security Director Harold Stassen boldly told McCarthy that he was " undermining " the State Department . Then the rewriting began . <P> With an air of " we 'll see about this , " McCarthy asked Secretary of State John Foster Dulles for an appointment . Dulles invited McCarthy over to lunch . For 75 minutes , Lawyer-Diplomat Dulles and Lawyer-Senator McCarthy ate and talked . Then they issued a weasel-worded joint communiqu . <P> Wrist &; Hand . " It was noted that cooperation and advice of members of Congress is helpful , " said the prepared statement . However , " it was pointed out the dangers that would result if congressional committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chief Executive . " <P> The communique went on : " Senator McCarthy . . . pointed out that neither he nor his committee had made or contemplated making any agreement with any . . . foreign shipping groups , but that , as a byproduct of the committee 's investigation , certain foreign shipping groups had voluntarily agreed among themselves to abstain from participation in the Communist China trade and inter-Soviet bloc trade , a result which both Secretary Dulles and Senator McCarthy felt was in the national interest . . . Senator McCarthy further advised that if in the future similar information would be developed it would be promptly communicated to the proper authorities . " <P> Foster Dulles had slapped McCarthy 's wrist , but he had also held his hand . Reporters surrounded McCarthy and asked about the wrist slap , and about McCarthy 's new melody . How did it happen that his negotiated agreement had been reduced to a voluntary byproduct ? Said McCarthy : " I do n't recall what I said the other day . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " negotiations " ( it was in the first line of his publicity handout ) , McCarthy asked : " Did we ? " Then he headed for a holiday in Florida . <P> Happy &; Not Unhappy . That left the hand-holding to be asked about . Reporters trooped into President Eisenhower 's press conference to fire question after question on Dulles ' failure to stand behind Stassen . The President was calm . He did n't think that McCarthy was really trying to take over the executive 's responsibility for negotiating international agreements . How could McCarthy or anyone negotiate if he had nothing to commit ? He did n't think that McCarthy 's act , even if it were an error , was serious enough to undermine the State Department 's efforts . Perhaps Stassen meant to use the word infringement ( instead of undermine ) , said the President . He was not unhappy with McCarthy or with Stassen . Relations between the executive department and the Congress were getting better and better , and he was n't going to let a little incident disturb him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
