U.S. Steel Hour . " You see , I got four daughters . Each one takes turns having me for a visit . Every three months , like clockwork , I get sent out-like a quarterly dividend . " This was the TV story of Walter Slezak , playing a retired furrier from Manhattan , whose bumbling social presence made his daughters uncomfortable and embarrassed their husbands . Visiting son-in-law No. 4 , an ambitious Hollywood agent , Slezak lumberingly wrecked a cocktail party by commenting amiably on a guest 's mink ( " Say , that 's a nice mutation you got there ; it 's not what you 'd call real mink , but I would n't worry about it if I was you . To the untrained eye , there 's no difference in quality " ) . Abashed , disheartened and in disgrace , he volunteered as patrol supervisor for a group of eight-year-old junior Rangers . His methods were unorthodox . The first course was artificial respiration- " what to do in case of drowning or being electrocuted . " Slezak had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naturally . There 's an emergency truck they got , with oxygen inside-a pulmotor-everything you need . What 's next ? " The young called him Uncle Chuck , and he was happy . But soon he was in his usual jam - the boys found the camping ground cold and hard , and so did he ; he bundled them all off to a motel , and everybody thought he had kidnaped them . Scripter John Vlahos could not resist the predictable switcheroo for a misty-moist ending ( the Rangers discovered the publicity on the Beaver Patrol had been sensational , and Uncle Chuck finally felt wanted ) , sometimes seemed to be writing an artful recruiting appeal for parent participation in youth groups . But his simple story was redeemed by an authentic feel for the peculiarly Jewish blend of wry humor and forthright sense of Manhattan 's Seventh Avenue , and the warm , shamblingly expert performance of Slezak , who can ( and frequently has ) played this kind of role so expertly that it seems disarmingly artless.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
