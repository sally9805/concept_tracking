KENTUCKY DERBY ODDS Following the Santa Anita Derby , Pricemaker Tony Alessio offered these odds on the May 3 Kentucky Derby in his Caliente Future Book : // Silky Sullivan // 2-1 // Tim Tam // 4-1 // Jewel 's Reward , Nadir // 6-1 // Sir Robby , Old Pueblo // 15-1 // Kentucky Pride , Li'l Fella , Hubcap , Nisht Amool , Music Man Fox // 20-1 // Aliwar , Olymar , Liberty Ruler , Seventy Six , Misty Flight , Victory Morn , Washington // 30-1 // Silky Sullivan won the Santa Anita Derby last week , and thereby established himself as the equine personality-although not yet the greatest horse  --  of the decade . // This amazing , flame-red chestnut has California in a condition akin to hysteria . He has , in addition to his captivating name , a trait which fascinates horse fans everywhere : he wins his races from behind , and from so " far behind that horsemen and " trainers from coast to coast agree that there may never have been a racer quite like him . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as the West Coast 's answer to Tim Tam and Jewel 's Reward for the Kentucky Derby , for which race he has now been , made favorite in the Caliente Future Book at the ridiculously short price of 2 to 1 . // To his old fans ( there was a record Derby crowd of 61,123 on hand ) this race was strictly a pushover . Silky only got 28 lengths behind in the backstretch ( in one of his races he trailed by 41 lengths ) , and then , instead of looping his field , he cut to the inside , zigzagged through the pack like a sure-footed halfback and won  --  going away  --  by 3 ? lengths . At the finish he was actually easing himself up , obviously satisfied that he had showed the field who was boss and what was the point of pouring it on . His time was a most creditable 1:492/5 ( making it the second fastest Santa Anita Derby on record , slower only than the two turned in by Your Host and Determine ) , and his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 23 seconds , was a more normal 242/5. // Santa Anita horseplayers will tell you that Silky Sullivan is the greatest horse that ever lived . People who have never seen a race in their lives  --  even on television  --  love him dearly . // Least excited about him  --  in public , anyway  --  are his two owners and their amiable trainer . Co-owners Tom Ross ( a successful lumberman ) and Phil Klipstein ( a retired cattleman ) , who went into this partnership about four years ago , are both plagued by heart conditions which have n't exactly improved through watching Silky Sullivan scare the clients with his late finishes . As a matter of fact , Ross had been forbidden to watch Silky run this winter until last Saturday . Their knowledgeable trainer is the California veteran , Reggie Cornell , who has few peers in the mastery of handling a large public stable on the busy , competitive West Coast circuit . Phil Klipstein , now 76 , has been associated with race horses for nearly 50 years ; he and Ross picked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave him to Cornell to develop . Looking at the 3-year-old colt today you see a great big , sturdy and well-muscled horse , just about 16 hands , with a tremendously thick neck ( " like a Percheron , " says Phil Klipstein ) , and , when you come to think of it , more resembling a solid quarter horse or a 5-year-old stud than a maturing 3-year-old . But Silky is a picture horse nonetheless , with a beautiful sheen to his chestnut coat and a placid disposition . He is always completely relaxed , gentle as can be in or out of his box stall , eats anything he can get close to ( except his admirers ) and is as tractable as a tired old lead pony. // Trainer Cornell is frank to admit that he has no idea why Silky starts slowly and finishes like a whirlwind . " Maybe he just likes to give his opposition a head start and then nail ' em . // " But the strange thing about Silky ( Cornell usually refers to his horse as the Silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks from the gate right with his field and then automatically after going a few yards he 'll take himself back without any help from the jock . From there on for the next half mile or so he runs awkwardly and as though he 's in some difficulty . Suddenly he 'll shift into high gear and really flatten out . From there on ( it 's usually about the three-eighths pole ) I 've never seen a horse in my life  --  or heard of one either  --  go faster . " // Most other horsemen who have watched and studied Silky Sullivan 's action in his races believe he must , in some way , be a freak . His trouble , say some , just has to be a physical disability in either his respiratory , circulatory or digestive apparatus . " Something , " says one oldtimer , " must be hurting this colt so that he takes himself back for the first part of it . You think of an automobile engine that sounds and acts rough when you first turn on the motor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Silky maybe he 's hurting somewhere when he suddenly starts to exercise violently , but after he goes a while his action shifts from that rough awkward movement into a smooth and beautiful one . Like a distance runner , maybe , who can go nowhere until he gets his second wind . " The theory of a respiratory defect also gains credence from the fact that , working a mile the other morning , he passed the finish line roaring like a diesel express . " If he were genuinely winded , though , " says Cornell , " he could never run like this and run this far . There must be more to it than that . " // Whatever Silky Sullivan does from here on , he is already a national hero , and , as Arcaro points out , " If there was to be a popularity contest among horses right now , this sucker would clean up 3 to 1 . " Silky 's sire , Sullivan , although he won over sprinters at Hollywood Park at distances up to a mile and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . There is a bit more evidence of stamina on the dam 's side , but if Silky goes much further than Saturday 's mile-and-an-eighth Derby he 'll be tripping more than lightly over his own pedigree . The horses he beat were , for the most part , not top-drawer . His most formidable rival , Old Pueblo , is a colt who should concentrate on sprints from now on and can be discounted as a distance threat . // Silky Sullivan , hero that he is , has a tough road ahead in hoping to be the next Santa Anita Derby winner to take the Kentucky Derby . The big question now was put clearly by Eddie Arcaro last week . " The important thing to remember , " says the man who has won more Kentucky Derbies than any other jockey , " is that Silky Sullivan has been making up 35 and 40 lengths on ordinary horses . What 's he going to do when he tries to give away all that ground to top colts and then nail them in the stretch ? If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Florida colts , Tim Tam and Jewel 's Reward , then he 's got to be good . Not only good but real good . " // Silky is going to get just that opportunity . His next stop : the Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park on March 29 , and then on to Keeneland and Churchill Downs for the big one . Do his connections think he has a chance ? " Listen , " says a jubilant Reggie Cornell , " the last time I saw Bill Corum I told him I would n't come back to Churchill Downs until I had a horse that would get me over there into his winner 's circle . Now I 'm ready to go back . "
