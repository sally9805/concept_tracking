When Army Chief of Staff Matthew B. Ridgway appeared before the House Armed Services Committee , a Democrat asked if the null cut in ground forces ordered by Commander in Chief Eisenhower by 1956 would affect the safety of the country . General Ridgway 's answer : " I think it does , sir . " <P> In his press conference last week , President Eisenhower was asked about General Ridgway 's criticisms . The President spoke just as bluntly : " General Ridgway was questioned in the Congress as to his personal convictions , and , naturally , he had to express them . <P> " His responsibility for national defense is , you might say , a special one , or , in a sense , parochial . He does not have the overall responsibility that is borne by the Commander in Chief , and by him alone , when it comes down to making the recommendations to the Congress . <P> " My recommendations , I repeat , were made from my best judgment of what is the adequate defense structure for these United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the decision has not been altered . And at this moment , I do n't see any chance of its being altered . "
