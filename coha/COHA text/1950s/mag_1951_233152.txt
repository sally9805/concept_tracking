Never before has the paint industry had such a winter . Said the Glidden Co. ' s President Dwight P. Joyce : " We used to spend the winter building up an inventory for spring . Now our plants are busy turning out latex-based paints which we sell as fast as we can make them . " <P> The $1 billion paint industry gets most of the credit for the drastic change in its market . By plugging new , easy-to-apply paints and labor-saving devices , it now sells 75% of its paint direct to householders , not to journeymen painters . And thanks to the high cost of painters , the industry is well on its way toward making every amateur an expert . <P> The biggest change , and the one that has boomed year-round painting , is paint with a rubber , instead of an oil , base . These paints are virtually odorless , will dry in an hour or so with windows closed . They are easy to apply , and it is almost impossible to leave brush marks with them .

Many companies have started selling rollers which take the backache out of painting walls and ceilings . Said an executive of W. P. Fuller &; Co. , the largest West Coast paint firm : " Our goal has been to sell not only paint , but a state of mind . Painting has always been a messy , dirty , disagreeable job . With rollers , it 's a cinch for the housewife . " <P> Rollers have been around for years . But the old-style roller was hardly an improvement on the brush ; it still had to be dipped in a pan , would drip paint . The newer rollers , made by Cleveland 's Kenwill Corp . and others , hold the paint inside the cylinder , let it out through holes onto a rubber or fabric sleeve so that it can be rolled on walls or ceilings without dripping .

Sears , Roebuck recently began selling a brand-new 4-in. wall brush that can be broken down into two smaller brushes simply by unscrewing the handle . Next week Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. is introducing a shed-proof , synthetic-bristled 7-incher for only $3.69 ( v. $25 and up for 5-in. pig-bristle brushes ) . <P> Color &; Confusion . Competition in the paint industry , long confined to quality , has spilled over into color . Companies like Glidden and Sherwin-Williams now put out elaborate sample books , complete with swatches of color and detailed advice to help housewives do a complete decorating job themselves . Housewives are no longer restricted to a small choice of colors . To help them further , Colorizer Associates has begun selling 16 pigments in tubes that can be mixed easily with a base paint . When one tube is added to a can , the color is guaranteed to match a color chart . <P> Other specialized paints : <P> Sapolin Co.

It " cleans " itself over the years by powdering off with the dirt . <P> Devoe &; Raynolds ' white wall and ceiling paint , which contains DDT , will kill insects , be effective for as long as five years .
