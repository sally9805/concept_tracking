txt Democratic policy makers in the House of Representatives ) are about ready to rule out a , general tax cut this session . Instead , they are now giving primary consideration in informal consultations to relatively minor reductions in excise ( sales ) taxes on autoniobiles and a few other goods and services . These Democratic strategists hold that general tax relief can not be justified as an antirecession weapon unless the economy should start declining at a much sharper rate than that of the last few months . And they believe the slump is unlikely to get much worse before Congress adjourns some time in July or August . Truce in Effect A tax-cutting truce is now in effect between Robert B. Anderson , Secretary of the Treasury , and the chief Democratic leaders of the House and Senate , Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senator Lyndon B. Johnson , both of Texas . Under a gentlemen 's agreement reached in mid-March , neither side will put forward a tax relief plan without consulting the other . As leader of the House , where revenue legislation originates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the door on any general tax cut this session . He would like thereby to put a quick end to the present uncertainty , which has been blamed for much of the widespread buyers ' ? resistance that is contributing to the business slump . Anderson Pledge Asked The Speaker has told colleagues that he would be willing to announce now his opposition to a general tax cut this session if Secretary Anderson would promise not to recommend one on behalf of the Administration . It is doubtful , however , whether Mr. Anderson would give such a pledge . The Administration , by all signs , does not want to foreclose all possibility of wide tax relief as a last resort weapon against a worsening recession . The apparent prospect , consequently , is for continuation of the truce at least until late May or early June and perhaps until Congress adjourns . In the immediate background of this situation is a growing feeling , reinforced by legislators ' consultations with constituents during the Easter recess , that there is no strong grass roots demand for general tax relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the fact that a tax cut would add to the already large prospective Federal deficit and increase the national debt . The possibility that tax reduction would set off another inflationary spiral is anther consideration very muchln the minds of legislators . Behind all this is a belief , which has gained widespread acceptance in the last decade , that tax reduction has lost virtually all its traditional political appeal . The mass of the voters now pay the bulk of their taxes as weekly deductions from their wages and are not so much aware of the heavy burden as they used to be . By and large . they are not vitally concerned over a possible increase of a mere $2 or $3 in weekly takehome pay that even a big tax cut would provide . Truman Victory Cited Those sharing the belief that tax reduction is no longer necessarily good politics point to recent history . Harry S. Truman won a surprising Presidential victory and the Democrats regained control of Congress in 1948 . A major campaign issue was the enactment by the preceding Republican ( Eightieth ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the Republicans losing their Congressional seats that year was Representative Harold Knutson of Minnesota , Ways and Means Committee chairman and sponsor of the tax relief bill . In the 1954 Congressional ' campaign , Republicans claimed credit for $7,400,000,000 of tax reductions . Yet they again lost control of Congress after two years in power . The excise tax reductions now under consideration would be provided as amendments to what ordinarily is a routine bill to postpone for another year automatic tax reductions scheduled for June 30 . Present law calls for the expiration then of rate increases , imposed to finance the Korean war , on corporation income and on automobiles , cigarettes and liquor . Congress Must Act Unless Congress acts , the corporation tax will drop from 52 per cent of earnings to 47 per cent . Simultaneous reductions would occur as follows : cigarettes , from 8 cents a pack to 7 cents ; liquor , from $10.50 to $9 a gallon ; beer , from $9 to $8 a barrel , and automobiles , from 10 per cent to 7 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend all these rates for another year except the one on automobiles : The automobile levy would be allowed to drop to 7 per cent or perhaps be fixed at 5 per cent . Halving the present rate would mean a saving of about $150 on a $3,000 car if the cut were passed along to the consumer , as manufacturers and dealers have promised . The bill probably would also provide for some reduction in the 3 per cent tax on transportation of property and in the 10 per cent levy on transportation of persons . Consideration also is being given to a cut in the 10 per cent tax on local telephone service .
