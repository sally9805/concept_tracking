Last week another Arab nation prepared to join the new anti-Communist Baghdad pact , but not without the kind of scuffling in the streets that so often passes for soul-searching in the Middle East . The prospective new member is the poor desert state of Jordan , which is under the wing ( but not the thumb ) of Great Britain . <P> Britain sent its top soldier , General Sir Gerald Templer , to Jordan with a tempting proposition : if Jordan would join the Baghdad pact , with Turkey . Pakistan , Iran and Iraq . Britain would boost its aid program ( currently $24 million a year ) , replace the present Anglo-Jordanian treaty with a new one more favorable to Jordan , and increase the size and armored strength of Jordan 's British-trained Arab Legion , whose 20,000 men are the best Arab troops in the Middle East . <P> Templer 's diplomacy worked well enough to win over some of Jordan 's leaders , including 20-year-old ( Harrow , ' 51- ' 52 ) King Hussein . Last week Premier Said el Mufti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the King promptly appointed a new Cabinet headed by a young ( 36 ) lawyer , Hazza el Majali . The new government was ready to accept Templer 's package proposals , but first it had to survive a tough test of its authority , mainly among the country 's half million destitute Arab refugees from Israel , who are easily inflamed to violence . <P> The way to stir up such mobs is to identify the Baghdad pact with the West , to identify the West with Israel , and then to stir up hatred of Israel . <P> Serious trouble erupted next day throughout the nation after the noon prayers in the mosques . Worshipers came storming forth , crying epithets against the Baghdad pact and the U.S. , attacked emergency patrols of the Arab Legion with sticks and stones . A tight censorship closed down over the capital city of Amman , but some details got out . In the Arab half of Jerusalem , the U.S. consulate was surrounded and stoned , while the wives and children of the U.S. staff huddled in the safest place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's end El Maja-li 's new government was still in control , but at least 40 people had been killed , some 300 arrested , and mobs were still milling in the streets .
