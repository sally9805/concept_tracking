SEVERAL years ago , when my main job was editing books , I began to wonder whether it might be possible to introduce at least a trace of scientific method into a wildly unscientific business . Every day authors or their agents would come in to get money to finance the writing of a book . Usually they would have a couple of chapters finished and an outline of the rest . Sometimes they had nothing but an idea , in their heads or scribbled on the back of an old envelope . ( One agent , whose effrontery I have always admired , did n't even have that . She said she represented a radio commentator , and she suggested that if a publisher would put up $10,000 so that he could lie on a Florida beach and think for a few weeks , he might bring back an outline for a possible book . ) On such tenuous security , publishers frequently advance sums ranging from $500 to several thousand dollars ? to be repaid out of the author 's royalty , if and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far-fromeager public . The decision is made almost entirely on the basis of sheer hunch ? or what publishers prefer to describe , wistfully , as " editorial judgment . " The editor takes a look at whatever the author has down on paper ; checks the sales and reviews of his previous books , if any ; finds out what he can about any recent books on a similar theme ; wonders whether the buying public will have any interest in the subject when the book is published , maybe two years later ; snakes a personal estimate of the writer 's talent , responsibility , and character ? and then takes a deep breath and decides how much of the firm 's money to gamble . ( Even when there is no advance to the author , publishing a book requires an investment of at least $5,000 . ) If an editor guesses wrong too often , he and his firm will be out of business . Even the best make so many bad guesses that every publishing house has to write off thousands of dollars in unearned advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be equally serious ; I remember with shame at least five authors whose demands I turned down as exorbitant , and who are now bringing in fat , green wads of money for rival firms . So ? like many another naive young editor ? I started to look for some clue which might help me to calculate on a less haphazard basis whether any given author would be likely to earn enough to repay the money he asked for . I made a careful study of the performance records of some two hundred writers , looking for common characteristics which would distinguish the good risks from the had . Two showed up . Nearly all the successful writers had them , while the failures did not . They were : I. An abnormal supply of simple animal energy . 2 . An over-charged ego . THIS discovery proved less than revolutionary , because there is another essential ingredienttalent ? which I never did learn to spot with any certainty until the writer had demonstrated it on paper , and not always then . Plenty of would-be authors are endowed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still ca n't write a lick . Yet it also seems to be generally true that the most luminous talent wo n't get very far when the other two qualities are missing . As a scientific finding , this may not amount to much ? but for an editor it does have its uses . In addition to cutting down his bad debt figures , it can help him in developing a working partnership with his authors . For , once they have entered into their curious alliance , the editor 's main jobs are then : ( a ) to keep his writer churning out manuscripts and ( b ) to nourish , protect , and shepherd that all-important ego . The first chore is relatively straightforward . If the writer possesses that overflowing vitality which has characterized such diverse specimens as Tolstoi , Edgar Wallace , Tom Wolfe , and Dickens , he will write as naturally as a fire burns . The publisher will have to sell enough books to stoke the auctorial flames with their necessary fuel : money . On occasion he may also need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subject matter , and to prune back the luxuriant prose which unbridled energy so often produces . But if the sheer physical drive is n't there , the case is hopeless . Writing is a punishing trade , and the feeble soon drop it . But there is nothing simple about the editor 's second duty . Ego-nursing will take a different form with every author ? but , like baby-raising , it always ought to begin with affection and respect . If an editor does n't like authors enough to put up with their tantrums and change their emotional diapers , he is in the wrong business . And he must understand that if a writer 's ego ever wilts , he is ruined . It is the only thing that can sustain him through those lonely months while he is trying to piece together a book out of one recalcitrant word after another . Every morning he has to persuade himself , all over again , that putting marks on paper is the most important thing in the world . . . that he has something to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but pay for . that it has not been said already ( or anyhow not so well ) by his innumerable competitors , from Homer to O'Hara . and therefore that his personal statement of Eternal Truth has to be recorded at all costs ? even if his children starve and his neglected wife takes up canasta . Only an ego-maniac can believe these things , for they defy all the evidence . Any rational man could sec that far too many books already are being published . that only a small fraction of them can possibly be reviewed ... that even these usually will encounter an invincible indifference . . . that most books are nearly as perishable as fresh vegetables , and soon doomed to be pushed off the store shelves by a fresh crop . . . that the odds therefore are overwhelmingly against any given writer making a ripple on the public consciousness . Or even making a living . For reasons noted in the special supplement on Writing in America which accompanies this issue of Harper 's , the average novelist can rarely hope to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books in type . Yet if his ego is sturdy enough , an author can ignore these facts and turn again to his typewriter ? confident that he is not like other men , and that his hook will beat the odds . And sometimes he is right . T H A T is why one veteran editor , William Sloane , once described his work as a cross between playing the horses and practicing medicine without a license . It is a kind of psychotherapy ? a process of reassuring the writer constantly that his genius is unique , that the last chapter was a gem , and that the world breathlessly awaits his message . Nor is this hypocrisy . It is true that an editor has to view the literary facts of life more realistically than a writer dares to , and that sometimes he has to administer flattery in doses that would gag an opera star . But , allowing for this therapeutic hyperbole , the editor believes what he says . He thinks his boy has what it takes , and he is backing this conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phony enthusiasm , in fact , just does n't work . The writer will soon spot it ? and so will the salesmen who eventually will have to try to persuade somebody to read the finished book . So a capacity for real ( arid soundly-based ) enthusiasm is perhaps the greatest asset an editor can have . For example , the way in which Alfred Knopf 's unsquelchahle enthusiasm for Joseph Conrad finally created an American market for his works is still a legend of the trade . a publishing house which spefiction once told me that he years with a highly successful Rarely in all that time did she ever talk about anything except her dominant obsession : the shameful way in which she was neglected and abused by her husbands , children , reviewers , booksellers , publishers , and public . Actually , he said , she was a pampered old dragon who got her own way in nearly everything and tyrannized the lives of everybody within reach . But her illusion was indispensable for her work . All her novels dealt with the same theme ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since this appealed to the streak of self-pity in millions of female readers , her books sold very well indeed . If she had ever been forced to confront the truth , she probably could never have written another line . Again , I was puzzled for a long time by the conviction of most unsuccessful writers that no publisher will read a manuscript unless it is thrust into his unwilling hands by a friend , a wealthy aunt , or the banker who holds the mortgage on the printing press . Repeatedly I tried to explain that reading manuscripts is a publisher 's business ? that he gives them careful attention , whether they are delivered by the postman , an agent , * or his own mother ; that , in fact , publishers are constantly on the prowl for new talent . Hardly anybody was convinced . At last it dawned upon me that not-yet-success- *Nearly a hundred literary agencies are now operating in New York . Perhaps a dozen of these have earned the full confidence of most publishing houses , because they understand the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a real possibility for a particular publisher 's list . Consequently , manuscripts from them often get prompter attention ; but no reputable firm ever declines a manuscript , from any source , without at least one responsible reading . THE EASY CHAIR ful writers need this myth , and t it is both useless and cruel to try dispel it . Suppose you have labo : for two years over The Great Am can Novel , investing in it all the f sion and talent at your comma Then it is rejected in quick suet sion by eleven publishers . There c be two possible explanations : 1 . Nobody ever read it ? or at b it was skimmed by some callow , co ; drinking junior reader , who could-recognize genius if it kicked him the tccth. 2 . The novel is no good. * Which would you believe ? Whi would you have to believe , if p planned to embark on another move THIS necessity for maintaining ; unshakable faith in his own tale sometimes leads an author into fa tasies which are less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . However tactful ti editor may be , the process is alwa painful ; and it is this which so oftt makes their relationship a tense an unstable one . For instance , when the sale of book is disappointing , the author a ways knows who 's to blame . If it ha been advertised properly ? with bil boards , skywriting , and TV comme cials ? if only the publisher had see to it that the New York Times n viewed this work , instead of wastin its space on Faulkner and Hemiru way ? then surely the public wont have discovered it , in carload lots . At this juncture the editor ma try to explain that the firm alread has spent far more on advertisin , than the book could hope to earl ... that book reviewers can neithe be pressured nor cajoled ? and tha any publisher who tries will sow regret it . . . that the public seem to be tiring of sensitive novels abou the torments of adolescence . tha a sale of 3,182 copies of a first nove really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have better lucl with the next one , especially if th , narrative pace is a little faster . These home truths ( Cont. p. 20 *A third possibility is that eleyel experienced editors read it ? and all n hem guessed wrong . This has happenec with the result that a twelfth publishe profited from their mistakes ; but sue ( dses are extremely rare . THE EASY CHAIR are no comfort to the author. * Quite possibly they will merely encourage him to look for another publisher . The same thing may happen when the editor offers advice on a manuscript . It may be his plain duty to point out that the heroine sounds like a fifth carbon of Scarlett O'Hara , and that a thirty-thousand-word description of Terre Haute in 1890 might well be cut out of the opening chapter . The writer may recognize these hints as sound and accept them gratefully . Or ? you never can tell ? he may regard them as a vote of no-confidence and a Philistine assault upon the integrity of his work . For this reason , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an author . Such reports are probably the best literary criticism being written anywhere . They often sum up the strengths , weaknesses , sales potential , and literary stature of a manuscript with remarkable precision . The New Yorker recently observed , in a memorial note about the late Wolcott Gibbs , that if his written editorial opinions " could be released to the world ( as they most assuredly ca n't be ) , they would make probably a funnier and sounder critique of creative writing in the late ' twenties and early ' thirties than has ever been assembled . " But such reports customarily are written with a succinct , pitiless candor which might easily wound an author to hi , very gizzard . Consequently a prudent editor keeps the original in a locked file , and transmits the gist of it to the author in gentler ( not to say muffled ) terms . Another thing which some writers find hard to tolerate is the idea that an editor is not a private possession , like a one-man dog . This type ( fortunately not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his literary affairs , but also to his plane reservations , theater tickets , and romantic tangles . Any reminder that the editor now and then has to *Nothing is ? short of astronomical sales and undiluted acclaim . And nobody is immune to the pangs of authorship , Between stints of editing , I once wrote a couple of honks myself . To my astonishment , I found that I developed all , the standard symptoms , although I knew perfectly well that my expectations were silly and my demands unreason- deal with the problems of other authors is likely to touch off a spasm of jealous anger , accompanied in extreme cases by accusations of neglect and disloyalty . This syndrome ( at least in my experience ) occurs most frequently among women ; perhaps it has something to do with their innate prejudice against polygamy . B U T the author 's ego is not the only potential source of friction . Editors also have egos which can cause trouble ? and with far less justification . The main danger here is that the editor may try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the writer . This is most apt to happen if the editor is himself a frustrated author ; he may then ? usually without realizing it ? attempt to influence a novelist to produce the epic he had wanted to create . The upshot almost surely will he a disaster for everybody . Or an editor may grow dogmatic . If he ever begins to think that he knows exactly how every kind of book ought to be written , and that he can guess infallibly what the public wants , then he is coming clown with that special form of hubris which is the occupational disease of his profession . It will make him miss both the truly original work of art and the good commercial item which ? according to conventional rules ? should he unsalable . I hate to remember the time when James R. Newman first told me his scheme for a history of mathematics . We were working together on a wartime intelligence assignment which had taken us to London , and one evening while we were drinking beer in his room at the Athenaeum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather all the basic documents of mathematical thought and arrange them into an anthology which would trace the development of the science in the words of the masters themselves . It would be a big book ? perhaps 500 pages . What did I think of it ? I told him it was impossible . Nobody would buy it ; its subject was too specialized ? in fact to most people ( including me ) downright repellent ? and it would be far too costly to manufacture . Why did n't he turn such as a book on chess ? a subjec on which he was equally expert Jim said he was bored with chess . A week or so later he said he hat revised his plan . He now though the hook should be two volumes-a really comprehensive work . Di ( that make it sound more promising : I said no , it sounded worse . Tht next night I flew to North Africa . We did n't meet again until the war was over . Jim then told nu that he had been plugging away- at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown to four volumes ; and that Simon &; Schuster was going to publish it . I was dumfounded : S S , always known as a real shrewd outfit , must have lost their minds . The rest is almost too humiliating for me to repeat . As everybody in the trade now knows , Newman 's The World of Mathematics became a phenomenon of publishing . Priced at an impossible S25 , it sold more than 120,000 sets ? in addition to distribution by two book clubs ? and is still selling a steady three thousand copies a year . It also shattered my confidence in my publishing judgment , probably for good . B U T all this may be giving a wrong impression . In spite of such calamities , the editing of books is one of the more cheerful trades . It has all the excitement of gambling . ( Before I got into it , I used to play poker quite a lot , though badly ; afterwards . I found I got enough action in the daytime . ) Exasperating as they sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are alike ; so the business has none of the monotony which must afflict a manufacturer of , say , canned milk . But the biggest psychic income is the editor 's feeling that he often helps to bring to birth a talent or an idea . He can , in his better moments , think of himself as a midwife to the culture of his time ? a part of the process by which civilization is created , preserved , and handed on from one generation to another . In his had moments , though , an editor may feel that his profession is almost as painful as an undertaker 's . The really depressing part has nothing to do with the wrong guesses or the trying habits of authors . It is just the constant necessity of saying : " No. " 2 . THE EASY CHAIR working hours in being mean to people . Every manuscript accepted must he winnowed out of a stack of hundreds which are hopeless . Many of those rejected can be sent back with a form letter ? but , for a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editor . Either by mail or face-to-face , he must tell the author that his child was stillborn ? that all his labor , ambition , and emotional investment have come to nothing . This always hurts ; or should hurt . I have a notion that any editor has only so many " No " s in his system . Some have a lot , others only a few . When they are all used up , he ca n't stand being mean any longer , and he dies . Or ? what amounts to the same thing ? he gets so calloused that he can say - No " without a twinge ; when that happens he is dead and does n't know it .
