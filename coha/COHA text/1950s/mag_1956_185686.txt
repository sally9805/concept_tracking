Sardinia , which is like nowhere . Sardinia , which has no history , no date , no race , no offering . They say neither Romans nor Phoenicians , Greeks nor Arabs ever subdued Sardinia . It lies outside ; outside the circuit of civilization .. -D . H. Lawrence , Sea and Sardinia <P> And so it was until the Yanks came . Midway through World War II , General Eisenhower 's forces crossed from North Africa to occupy the bald , sirocco-scorched island of Sardinia ( pop . 950,000 ) as a bomber base for the invasion of southern France . They ran up against the malaria that infested the coastal marshes and that throughout history has kept invaders back and the islanders down . Thereafter , by one of the most intensive campaigns ever waged against malaria , U.S. and Italian DDT teams banished the anopheles mosquito that had helped stunt the development of a people long accounted the smallest of Italians . Since 1950 there has not been a single new case of malaria in Sardinia . <P> Rocky Reform . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become possible for the proud , primitive islanders . Italy 's ambitious , $2 billion Cassa del Mezzogiorno ( Fund for the South ) is now transforming the rocky , scrub-covered face of Sardinia . Already the fund 's associated agencies have taken over a third of the island 's arable land from large holders and passed it out to peasants in 15-acre plots . By draining the old malarial swamps , the agencies are making another 185,000 acres of cropland for small holders . But the most ambitious project by far is a $75 million complex of three dams being built to catch floodwaters which race seasonally down the Flumendosa , Sardinia 's most important river , and are lost in coastal lagoons . <P> Besides generating 90 million kilowatts to light the houses that will dot the new green fields , the dams will divert the pent-up waters through some 900 miles of new canals and ditches to irrigate an estimated 150,000 acres of barren southern plains around the capital city of Cagliari ( pop . 100,000 ) . The 100,000 villagers now living in the area may see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole level of Sardinian farmers ' life should rise to levels undreamed of in the old days when most scratched out a lean living by herding ( or stealing ) sheep in the mountains by winter , hoeing a few acres in summer in the lowlands . After 20 centuries , Sardinia may once again win a name as Rome 's granary . Already the fund 's crewcut , sports-jacketed young Italian engineers are saying that after the Flumendosa Valley is remade , underpopulated Sardinia may be able to absorb thousands of Italy 's mainland unemployed . <P> Proud Eye . Italy 's urbane , frail Premier Antonio Segni comes from Sardinia . As the father of Italy 's postwar land reform ( he himself surrendered 200 acres of rich olive groves outside Sassari ) , Premier Segni keeps a proud eye on the Sardinian transformation , and almost every Sunday without fail flies the 125 miles from Rome to his Sassari villa . The new Sardinia may do him political good , too , helping to hold his Christian Democratic pluralities on the island in Italy 's nationwide municipal elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
