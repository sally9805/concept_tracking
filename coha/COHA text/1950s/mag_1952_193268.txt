When Oliver Edmund Clubb , 51 , retired from the U.S. Foreign Service last month , the business of his previous suspension and clearance seemed all settled and done with . A veteran diplomat who became chief of the State Department 's Office of Chinese Affairs , Clubb got into trouble after Whittaker Chambers testified that he had once ( 1932 ) seen him in the offices of the Communist New Masses . In the course of defending himself against this not very grave charge , Clubb produced his personal diaries . These contained very candid entries about the Foreign Service and about Clubb 's colleagues . These convinced the State Department Loyalty and Security Board that first examined the case that Clubb was too indiscreet to be a secure repository of secret information . Nevertheless , a month ago Clubb was allowed to retire with a pension of $5,800 a year ; he announced that he had been cleared by departmental " processes , " which everyone assumed meant State 's investigating board . <P> A word from Secretary of State Dean Acheson would have corrected this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notably Wisconsin 's Senator Joe McCarthy , charged that Clubb had been cleared through Acheson 's personal intervention . Last week Acheson felt compelled to tell the story of just what happened . <P> State 's Loyalty and Security Board had , in fact , found Clubb a security risk ( his loyalty was not questioned ) . This judgment was appealed to Acheson , who turned the matter over to an " experienced and trusted " aide . Though the Clubb case involved the highest ranking Foreign Service officer yet to come under inquiry , Acheson said : " I read my aide 's opinion very carefully . I did not study the record because ... I do not have time to do that . " On the basis of his aide's* recommendation , the Secretary overruled his board . <P> It was more fuel for the fires of congressional investigators and a probe of the Clubb case seemed likely . It was also another illustration of Acheson 's inability or unwillingness to 1 ) believe that the question of internal security seriously concerns his department ; 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Foreign Service , and expect him to tell them what steps he is taking to protect it . <P> <P> * Identified as Nathaniel P.
