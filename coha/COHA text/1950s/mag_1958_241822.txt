" In the final moments of the flight , " burbled a story in the New York Post , " the space passenger lost all sense of up and down . " So . it seemed , had the Post as well as hundreds of other free-world newspapers that blasted off last week with an Associated Press report that Russia had shot a manned missile into space . For , despite such hedged headlines as the New York Daily News 's REDS SAY ROCKET MAN ROSE 186 MI. , it was palpably clear from the start that 1 ) the Reds had said no such thing , and 2 ) the coming of the Sputnik has infected even seasoned editors with the urge to hitch headlines to almost any misguided missile . <P> Competitive Flight . Last week 's space junket took off on a typewriter at 7:52 p.m . Monday in Paris , where Agence France-Presse , on a telephoned tip from its Moscow Bureau Chief Constantin Zar-nekau , flashed : " For the first time , a man has been put aboard a Soviet rocket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , after communicating with Moscow Bureau Chief Henry Shapiro , United Press put on the wire a wary note to editors stating that there were " rumors " in Moscow of a manned rocket but " no official confirmation . " Reuters also sidled up to the story with its kid gloves on . <P> Then , about an hour and a half after the A.F.P. flash , the Associated Press , biggest news agency of them all , filed a Moscow-datelined bulletin ( which was actually written in London ) : " The Soviet Union has launched an experimental rocket 300 kilometers into the atmosphere with a human aboard , reliable sources said here tonight . " So began a competitive stratosphere flight that outdid all competitors in irresponsibility . <P> As deadlines neared for U.S. morning papers , A.P . aimed even higher , wider and wilder . Said its night lead , still without any confirmation : " Soviet Russia has shot a man-carrying rocket 186 miles into the air and the man parachuted safely back to earth , reliable sources said tonight . " The A.P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no official announcement whatever , " but added : " The official silence-in view of the rumors sweeping Moscow-led to some speculation that ... the manned rocket experiment may not have been a total success . " <P> Astronaut . By next day , editors around the world had showered Moscow correspondents with their own rockets ( correspondents ' term for inquiries about competitors ' stories ) . France-Soir and London 's Daily Mail both ran Page One drawings of the compleat astronaut in space suit , breathing gear and seat belt . Said one query : " Like interview and first-person impressions . " Demanded another : " Competition says it 's woman , not man . Confirm . " <P> Unable to confirm anything , the A.P . allowed early Tuesday that there were still " no hints as to the mystery traveler 's identity " - but volunteered no hints as to the identity of its mysterious news informants . Turning to such tried-and-true sources as Estes Kefauver and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory 's Fred Whipple ( who , said A.P. , " expressed no surprise " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with scientific and political punditry.
