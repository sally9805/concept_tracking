txt A Universal Military Training program is almost certainly killed for this session of Congress . After as involved a parliamentary tangle as Washington can recall , the House in a 236-to-162 roll call sent the bill back to the House Armed Services Committee . There it is expected to rest , according to Representative Carl Vinson ( D ) of Georgia , committee chairman . Senator Ernest W. ( D ) of Arizona , Democratic leader , immediately indicated the Senate would not take up the measure in view of the House vote . The House action was a stunning blow to Democratic and Pentagon leaders . who at moments in the tangled House voting felt the legislation they had been pressing for would be approved . Opposing Groups Thus ends more than a week of House floor debate that found veterans groups urging passage of UMT , and church , school , and labor organizations attacking it . The involved parliamentary procedure through which the measure went , found the House tentatively approving , then defeating , a substitute measure that would have scrapped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military training in the high schools . The final vote , defeating a UMT program , was on the original bill that had been introduced by Chairman Vinson without any of the amendments approved by the Armed Services Committee . In the first vote in the House , proponents of the measure beat down 196 to 167 a direct Republican attempt to kill the measure , by sending it to committee . Speaker Sam Rayburn ( D ) of Texas had pleaded with the members to " face the issue directly " and not pigeonhole it by parliamentary maneuver , Amendment Offered Mr. Vinson , hen offered an amendment to meet some of the criticism of the measure by setting its termination date at July 1 , 1958 , and specifying that UMT could not begin until the drafting of men for service had been stopped . This strategic retreat , aimed at winning doubtful votes . was approved , 126 to 9 with the House sitting as Lhe " committee ' of the whole house . " Next the House , continuing as a " committee of the whole house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a military training program in colleges and universities resembling an expanded ROTC . A substitute for this was then introduced and passed 150 to 145 providing for military training for youths in the junior and senior years of senior high school . This bill was supported by a big majority of Republicans and a sizable group of Democrats , but a large number of Democrats , who might have opposed it , were not present . At this point Mr. Vinson demanded a roll-call vote on the substitute bill , and with many supporters of the high school plan voting against it , it was defeated 235 to 156 . Original Bill Left Under the House rules of procedure , this left the original Vinson bill , without any of the amendments that previously had been tied to it , the only business before the House . A motion to recommit the measure to committee was then made by Representative Dewey Short ( R ) of Missouri  --  and carried 236 to 162 . That ended the voting  --  and apparently ended the UMT issue for this session of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic leadership to first defeat the Republican move to recommit the bill and then , after watering it dowil with amendments , get it passed . The first part of the plan succeeded , but it collapsed when the Democrats could not muster enough votes to kill the substitute measures introduced . Thus the opposition , which lost on its opening bid to get the measure recommitted , achieved that goal in the final vote . Defeat of UMT does not , It is pointed out here , affect the status of the draft law , which remains in effect ; nor does it nullify the preliminary Universal Military Training provisions voted into law last year . That law provided that UMT could not begin without enactment of further legislation ; and it is that legislation which has been rejected . While the Senate theoretically still has a chance to act on UMT legislation this session , the fact that the House has shelved it is believed enough to keep the Senate from taking it up . What is the use , commented Senator in taking up our time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House .
