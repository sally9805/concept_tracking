After over 4 years of writing his breezy , brassy columns , Billy Rose this week called it quits . In his farewell , Rose wrote : " I may feel differently about it one of these days , but as of this writing-propped up in bed and with a magnum of morphine sloshing around in my veins-I 've about made up my mind to stop . " Rose underwent an operation recently , and " I found that , for the first time in my 51 Novembers , I was n't snapping back the way I should-that the ever lovin ' elastic was n't there any more . . . Three weeks after the patch-up job , I 've still got a headful of fog and a skinful of ache . " <P> Rose hated to give up columning and said so . One reason was that the column that started as a paid ad in the New York Daily News ( TIME , June 24 , 1946 ) had spread into 400 daily and 2,000 weekly newspapers and was netting Rose about $3,500 a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to leave the stage with that big an audience in the house . " But the tough little showman , who has been sandwiching his writing in between running his nightclub and theater , finally learned what every good columnist knows : that turning out a column three times a week is close to a full-time job . Concluded Rose : " And now , as the sun sinks in the West and the nurse shoves a thermometer in my face , I reluctantly say farewell to the lovely land of green eyeshades and printer 's ink . It 's been a real nice clambake and-who knows-maybe we 'll bump into each other again . "
