In the free-wheeling stagecoach days of the 1850s , Dallas won fame as a lively center of the buffalo-hide trade . But last week , the city played host to 5,000 department-store and specialty-shop buyers who were too busy to bother with Dallas ' frontier past . They came to see the up-to the-minute fall styles of the city 's bustling fashion industry , eighth largest in the U.S <P> In the Hotel Adolphus showrooms and on the display racks of busy shops along Commerce and Poydras Streets , 859 manufacturers showed off their styles , designed with the splash and color which have made Texas clothes a big-selling favorite of 20,000 retail stores in 3,500 cities and towns all over the U.S. To service these far-flung outlets , Dallas manufacturers have taken to air freight ; last year Texas ' own Slick Airways flew out 349,000 pounds of Dallas fashions , which have even invaded Manhattan . <P> Lusty Infant . Such high-flying merchandising methods are commonplace in Dallas ' fast-growing fashion trade . The industry got its big start in the mid-1930s , when the wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in open-shop Dallas ; soon it had an $18-million-a-year volume . It concentrated on sport clothes and other casual wear in big demand in mild-weathered outdoor-loving Texas . With World War II , the Dallas garment industry hit the big time ; last year it provided jobs for 10,000 and produced a sales volume of $60 million . <P> While growing , it expanded into high-style lines for such swank stores as Dallas ' own Neiman-Marcus , and into specialties like the stylish maternity gowns made by Dallas ' Page Boy ( TIME , Sept. 6 , 1948 ) . One big Dallas maker , Justin McCarty , Inc. , rang up $2,500,000 in 1949 sales with sportswear items . But nothing in Dallas had grown quite as fantastically as Nardis Sportswear , run by high-pressured little Bernard L. Gold , 51 . <P> Tough-talking Benny Gold often sounds like a New York cab driver , and used to be one . Born in Russia , he started a taxicab company in Brooklyn soon after World War I , went broke when he tried to buck the cab drivers during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run me out . " <P> Corduroy Man . Benny ran all the way to Texas , where his brother Irving was part owner of Nardis , a near-bankrupt dress firm which he wanted Benny to pull out of the red . To the horror of other Dallas garmentmakers , who are still only 20% unionized , Benny called on the International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union for help . I.L.G.W.U. engineers taught him an assembly-line method of making dresses . Benny not only signed a union contract but became the first Dallas manufacturer to employ Negroes . Benny 's experiment was a success : from a one-shop company with 15 machines , he expanded Nardis into five plants employing 1,100 . He specialized in the use of corduroy for women 's suits and dresses ; last year , with a gross of $5.5 million , he topped all other Dallas manufacturers .
