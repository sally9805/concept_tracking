Not long ago Robert Merrill , a young man with the flashing , dark good looks of a desert prince and an opera singer on whom music critics have showered some of their most shimmering adjectives. received a tribute that is unquestionably unique in the lengthy history of the Metropolitan Opera . It was a short note , and it read . " Dear Mr. Merrill : Your Rigoletto last night was absolutely dreamy. even from where we sat . We started out as a Sinatra fan club . hut , man , we 're changing . " The note was signed by four girls who had formed themselves into the sixth ? so far ? Robert Merrill Fan Club . Though the management of the Metropolitan might arch an aristocratic eyebrow at the new Merrill Fan Club . it could scarcely be surprised , for it has come to accept rather unusual doings both from Merrill and from his devotees . To begin with , Merrill looks as much like an opera singer as Hopalong Cassidy does . He is not florid in appearance or extravagant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . and though he dresses well it is with a kind of summer-camp informality rather than with the foppish elegance associated with opera stars . He likes baseball , for instance , a pastime most opera people regard as backward if not actually primitive ; and in a profession where the display of volcanic temperament appears almost obligatory . Merrill 's disposition remains endlessly sunny . Most opera stars , in crossing a stage ? or even a room ? proceed with ponderous. grave dignity , but Merrill . on stage or off . moves in a series of uninhibited bounces . When he is telling a story , his eyes roll comically , like those of a doll whose eyes are weighted , and sometimes he amuses friends by doing an old-time minstrel cakewalk , accompanying himself by humming outlandish old tunes . The figures of most opera stars resemble beer mugs. but Merrill 's is lithe and graceful . partly because he does n't possess the typical wolfish hunger of most opera stars . After a performance Merrill has been known to decline to join his colleagues in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugstore for a sandwich and a glass of milk . Most opera people . to whom massive eating is part of tradition . regard this characteristic of Merrill 's as highly eccentric if not worse . But they seldom speak of it , perhaps fearing that the Metropolitan management might allude to the quality of Merrill 's voice and then suggest bacon-and-tomato sandwiches for the entire troupe . Merrill is never late for rehearsals . does not disport himself in night clubs with either pretty blondes or rich lady opera patrons . and in general is not a public figure except as his work demands . One curious whim , however , sometimes places him on stages less decorous than the Met 's . This concerns Merrill 's good friend Danny Kaye . and it takes the form of an odd conviction that there is only one thing in the world that can make a Danny Kaye act any better than it is and that one thing is Robert Merrill . During Kaye 's last engagement at the Palace Theatre in New York . some people had the impression that Merrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never billed and never paid , but he was nevertheless on hand one day , bursting into songs , going through gag routines . and in general lending a helping hand . The audience , needless to say , loved it . Kaye loved it . and Merrill himself was like a small child on Christmas morning . Merrill simply lurked in the wings until Kaye went on . He waited ? politely ? for Kaye to finish his opening number . and then he strolled on stage and the horseplay began . It went on so long that it threw the theatre 's timing schedule off . but the audience was so visibly enjoying itself that the theatre manager let the unannounced fun go on .  | Yet for all his vivaciousness , his love of antique gags , his total lack of " artistic " or long-hair pretense , Robert Merrill is nevertheless an authentic musical marvel , probably the best Bari -- tone at the Metropolitan and certainly the most popular . Serious music lovers like his voice not only for its clarity but also for its phenomenal volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can outshout them all , " i.e - says . ) Another of his talents is his talent for acting , or at least overacting . There is more ham in Merrill than in Chicago , but in opera this is all right . Opera plots commonly involve some of the more flamboyant aspects of human relationships , such as suicide . homicide , insanity , and the dramatically broken heart , and any subtlety in acting technique would simply not register . In opera a man with a broken heart often behaves as if someone had just piled the UN buildings on him ; and when a man goes mad on an operatic stage , the stagehands reinforce the sets . Merrill is superb at this kind of acting . He whines , rages , blubbers , shrieks ? all with his hurricane voice . And the audience believes him . The real music lovers love him , but he is popular with another group as well . This group is composed mostly of girls , of all ages , who think Merrill is real cool . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothered , or it may be that this appeal is no more complicated than sex appeal . Younger girls are noticeably present at a Merrill performance ( and Metropolitan tickets cost considerably more than those to the neighborhood movie ) . In any event Merrill 's popularity on the operatic and concert stage , his TV and radio appearances ( where he makes more than any other Met star ) , his income from recordings , both classical and pop , make him one of the highest paid opera stars in the world . In addition to this , he has made frequent appearances at The Sands in Las Vegas . A clue to his appeal may be found in the fact that last March he played the two weeks between Tallulah Bankhead and Lena Horne , two stars whose sex appeal is clearly mountainous . From all his musical enterprises , Robert Merrill this year will make something over $100,000 , which is n't bad for a thirtyfive-year-old who not too many years ago was singing " Home on the Range " four times a day , five on Saturdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall for a salary that today Merrill shudders to recall . ROBERT MERRILL started life as Merrill Wolf Miller on June 4 , 1919 , in a cold-water flat in Brooklyn , New York , the third of four children of Polish immigrants . His father ran a small shoerepair shop and had hopes that if fate were kind his son would join him in the shop . The boy went to the usual elementary public schools in Brooklyn and distinguished himself by maintaining a singularly indifferent level of scholarship . His mother , noting his grades , decided that if he did n't exactly shine at the 170 three R 's he might shine in music , and so , when he was twelve , she hastened him off to the first of his piano teachers . In all he had five , and their reaction to the young boy 's playing was identical : He was hopeless . There seems to be some official confirmation for this view , for the records of the music department of the high school the boy attended describe him as tone-deaf . Music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not interest many a young man . He did n't want to play the piano ; he wanted to play baseball , and because piano lessons would interfere with his time on the sand lots , he craftily displayed such a devastating lack of musical talent that one by one his teachers gave him up . This accomplished his purpose : release to the baseball diamond . When he was sixteen , he got a job with a local semipro team called The Kings . He earned $10 a game . Inflamed with the lure of this easy money , he decided that he would become a professional ball player , and he confided this ambition to his mother . She made a deal with him : He could try to become a ballplayer if he would continue his music lessons . " Music lessons , " the boy said . " For what ? " " For me , " his mother said . It was about this time that Bing Crosby was entering into national prominence , and the young boy decided that if he had to study music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitate Crosby . His mother agreed to the change . His lessons took place at night , and on one occasion he was about to leave the house when his father , who had n't been apprised of the new direction in which his son was heading , asked him where he was going . " To take a voice lesson , " the boy replied . " A voice lesson ? " the old man asked , in a fine , Polish accent . " What 's the matter , you ca n't talk ? " But Merrill 's career was still secondary to baseball . The $10 he got playing with The Kings looked gigantic , so when he was seventeen he wangled a tryout with the Brooklyn Dodgers . Casey Stengel , then with the Dodgers , watched him for a while and then came up and put his hand on the boy 's shoulder . " Sorry , sonny , " he said . AN UNCLE got Merrill a job in a wholesale dress factory located in the center of Manhattan 's garment district , about 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push the garmentladen delivery trucks through the streets . Even today he can not estimate how many times he passed the vast opera house , but he can remember that he never bothered to look up . Meanwhile he was practicing his Bing Crosby imitations . The fact that they were imitations does n't mean much ; we forget today that for a period everybody sang like Crosby . Of course Merrill sang scales and classical songs for his teacher ? and his mother ? back in Brooklyn , but the songs he really liked were items like " Sweet Leilani " and " Pennies from Heaven . " These heresies he kept from his teacher , who one day scratched his head and announced that he thought that Merrill had a pretty good voice and he should try another teacher , a more advanced one . The boy accordingly presented himself to a singing teacher named Sam Margolis . Although Merrill did n't know it , Margolis was one of the most celebrated teachers in New York . He listened to young Merrill , who perversely chose to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " Young man , " he said . " you got a voice . Yes . You want to work ? " " Work for what ? " asked Merrill . " To be a singer . " " But I already am a singer . " The old man exploded . " You are a singer , " he cried , " like I am a streetcar ! " Merrill went away , promising Margolis he would think it over . He returned in two days , ready for work . Margolis ' reaction was quietly classic . " Now we begin , " he said harshly . Then a smile spread across his face . " Young man , " he said to Merrill , " I can promise you nothing , but I can also promise you everything . " For two years Merrill studied the basic theory of singing with Margolis by night ; by day he continued to push his employer 's racks through the streets of the garment district , past the Metropolitan . These days , however , Merrill bothered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a summer job at Scaroon Manor , one of the borsch-circuit resort hotels in the Adirondacks . Merrill ( he had by now permanently changed his name ) was hired as a singer , but it was a long time before he sang so much as one note . His first job at Scaroon Manor was as an assistant to an act called The Three Stooges . " I was , " Merrill explains today , " a stooge 's stooge . " The Stooges ' act was a rowdy one , part of which reached a climax when The Stooges , all three of them , brought Merrill down with three flying tackles , an art form not normally familiar to operatic stars . Other parts of the act consisted of whackings , loud cries and pitiful moans , and repeated facial muggings and eyeball rollings . Merrill 's present-day acting technique obviously springs from his training in that turbulent school . One day The Stooges announced that a new part they had prepared for Merrill required him to wear a tuxedo . Merrill explained that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200 for the entire summer season , he did n't propose to buy one . The Stooges generously procured one for him and rather airily waved off his thanks . Merrill was profoundly moved , seeing in this an example of the basic kindness of show people , which he had heard about . He did n't learn for years that The Stooges had simply appropriated the suit from the resort 's prop room . The Stooges left and were replaced by the now famous Red Skelton , and Merrill , mot-. or less the resort 's built-in stooge , was assigned to him . Skelton was working out a routine in which he played six commuters eating doughnuts at a lunch counter . The act is now a celebrated television standard , but in those days it was unknown . Merrill helped Skelton , dashing up and down the stage , uttering the piteous cries The Stooges had taught him . Skelton thought he was excellent , and so did the audience , but he still was n't singing . He went to the leader of the resort 's little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're long hair , " the leader explained . Merrill promptly broke into one of his four Crosby numbers and halfway through stopped . " Is that long hair ? " he asked . He got the job . So the singer hired to sing finally got a chance to sing , but only popular stuff . One night when the band , except for the piano player , was off the stand for an intermission , Merrill thrust at the pianist an accompaniment for an aria from The Barber of Seville and muttered , " Play it . " To the surprise of perhaps everyone but Merrill , the long-hair music was a success , and soon the exstooge sang two or three operatic arias every night , between his Crosby numbers . Two years later Merrill sang that same Barber of Seville aria , the famous " Figaro , " for a fill-in spot on NBC and got a three-year contract . But though he had a good radio contract , he was n't in opera , so that year he tried out ? still pumping away at " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He won first prize , and the next year he made his first appearance on an operatic stage . It was n't the Metropolitan ; it was in Trenton , New Jersey . The opera was Aida , and in the cast was one of opera 's all-time greats , Giovanni Martinelli . Martinelli was making his last appearance on an operatic stage , and Merrill was making his first . Students of the opera may be interested to know that the young Merrill played the part of the old Martinelli 's father-in-law . The Trenton Aida was a success , and then Merrill sang The Barber of Seville in Montreal , with Ezio Pinza . Everyone in the cast but Merrill was Italian , and to tease the newcomer they ad-libbed most of their spoken lines , thus throwing Merrill completely off , since he did n't speak Italian and had to rely on memorized cues . He struggled along for about ten minutes , singing his part as well as he could between gaping silences and miscues . Finally he simply began to double-talk , in what sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the cast . The rest of the troupe quickly resumed their traditional lines . Merrill had revenge , of a quiet sort , a few years later when Pinza opened in South Pacific . He went backstage and innocently asked his friend , " How do you like those cues now ? In English ? " It was at this time that Merrill made a recording of " The Star-Spangled Banner . " It was designed as a sign-off for radio stations across the country ; a baritone voice was less frivolous than a tenor , the recording company decided . It is still being used . Merrill can not estimate the number of times his voice singing " The Star-Spangled Banner " has been broadcast , but probably enough for some sort of a record . THE opera that began his Metropolitan career was La Traviata , in December 1945 . Merrill was selected to sing the part of the elder Germont . It was his Metropolitan debut , and he was as nervous as only a Metropolitan debut can make a singer . Opposite him was Licia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distraught the boy was . She helped him , almost like a mother . She made her cues obvious . She helped him take stage positions ( more important in opera than in plays because of placement for duets or trios ) , and she led him , gently , whenever they sang together . At the end of the second act Merrill was so overcome by her kindness  | to a beginner , that , dressed in a garish , purple Italian nineteenth-century costume and wearing , not only a wig but a beard , he rushed out into the street , ran two blocks to a florist 's , and returned with three dozen roses . He wanted to make sure they would be in her dressing room after the final curtain . Arturo Toscanini , whom some musicians regard as only slightly less lofty than Moses , had long wanted to record La Traviata , and when he heard of the young Merrill 's performance , he sent notice that he wanted him for the recording . It was an unprecedented honor for so young a singer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How did you like your performance ? " the maestro asked . Merrill stammered out his thanks for being allowed to sing with the great Toscanini . " Never mind about me , " Toscanini said . " We know about me . How did you like your performance ? " Merrill was happy with it , just as happy as he was with the 750,000 sales of a pop tune , " The Whiffenpoof Song , " which he recorded that same week . It was about time for Hollywood to prick up its ears about this handsome youngster who could also sing , and Hollywood did . They showed him a script that offered him a chance to sing , and he accepted the offer . When he got to Hollywood , the script was changed . No arias . " Everybody knows you can sing arias , " a producer explained . " So why sing them ? " He sang one duet , " My Beloved , " with his costar , Dinah Shore , in the film , which was called Aaron Slick from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Merrill says , " My , Dinah Shore is a nice girl . " Actually he is happy that the picture was such a flop . He feels that if it had been even a slight success he might have stayed on in Hollywood , which he did n't like . Merrill , in referring to his film " career , " likes to quote the immortal Fred Allen remark " California is all right if you 're an orange . " His one movie was a failure . He had another failure ahead of him : his first marriage . In March , 1952 , it was announced that he was going to marry Roberta Peters , one of the best , and certainly the prettiest , of the young Metropolitan stars . They were married later that month . The marriage lasted only fifty-nine days , only thirty of which the couple spent together , because of their various singing engagements . They parted amicably and today sing side by side in a number of Metropolitan productions . " It was nobody 's fault , " Merrill says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many . " Last spring , on May 30 , 1954 , Merrill was married again , this time not to an opera singer but to a former concert pianist named Marion Machno , from Michigan . After the wedding the couple traveled to Havana , where Merrill had an opera engagement , and then continued on to Europe , where he kept a recording date . Now , of course , they 're back in this country and Merrill is back at the Met . There is little doubt that Merrill has considerably broadened the appeal of both the long-hair singer and of opera in general . For one thing he is Americanborn . ( In 1945 , the year of his debut , a large per cent of the Metropolitan 's roster were European-born artists ; today about 75 per cent are American-born , and Merrill 's astounding success has been enormously important in effecting this change . ) Merrill 's popularity is unusual , because he is a baritone . Most of the famous male singers of opera are tenors , partly because baritone roles are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roles of old men , heavies , or unrequited lovers . Merrill 's appeal manages to penetrate the roles and even the costumes he is obliged to assume . Merrill , despite his six-figure income , lives in a modest apartment whose most noteworthy furnishings are his records . He plays them constantly , liking music as a background for even his nonperforming hours . After an opera performance he often has dinner in some unpretentious restaurant with his wife and sometimes his mother and father . The last has in recent years bashfully admitted that maybe his first reaction to his son 's career was n't quite wise . One day last summer Danny Kaye arranged a game of golf with Merrill and Bing Crosby . The three men played merrily through the first nine holes , and then Kaye revealed Merrill 's secret . " This guy , " he told Crosby , " once thought he could sing as well as you . " Crosby pretended horror . " What a nerve ! " he cried . " Exactly , " agreed Kaye . " But just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you two fellows run through a song together . Something classical , like Darktown Strutters ' Ball . ' " So as the men walked to the tenthhole tee , the two singers burst into " Darktown . " Kaye pranced along beside them , doing the strutting . Merrill was lyrically happy . He felt he had really arrived .  |
