THE CENTER OF THE STAGE ( 290 pp. ) - Gerald Sykes-Farrar , Straus &; Young ( $3 ) . <P> Dr. David Holderness , M.D. , was no Ulysses-he was just a more or less preoccupied research man returning to the U.S. after a long stay abroad , and wondering how to pick up the threads of his marriage . In a way , his son Pete reflected , the situation did resemble the old Greek story : " Enigmatic Mother , Absent Father , Disagreeable Suitors . " <P> Carlotta , the Enigmatic Mother , was a frisky and fashionable actress living a life of frantic emptiness . And the Disagreeable Suitors were a passel of New York busybodies , creatures on the make . From this situation Novelist Sykes , an urbane critic of the U.S. urban way of life , has spun a quiet and thoughtful novel . <P> Carlotta , says one of her friends , is possessed by " the Zeitgeist . " For her , everything runs by fad : in the ' 30s she marched in Union Square , now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind as sleek as her skin , shrewd in business , burning with vanity , oozing prefabricated charm , she personifies the glossiest in Manhattan nightclub and summer-resort society . One weekend , in the summer of 1950 , while the radio hums with reports of war in Korea , Carlotta throws a party in East Hampton for a speculator in money and models , a fellow-traveling movie director , an interior decorator with Lesbian appetites , and the decorator 's religious husband and soul-sick daughter . Son Pete finds them all disagreeable , but ca n't quite say why . <P> Suddenly , Dr. David Holderness makes his entry . At first Carlotta is charmed ; her rediscovered husband appeals to her sense of the theatrical . But gradually he rouses the irritation he always did . Even in his silence , " he made her feel shabby . " seeming implicitly to criticize her way of life . Each of Carlotta 's guests uneasily senses David 's moral strength , and each turns to him for help ; but he can give none of them the ready-made solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own life and to root himself in " a country-bred wisdom " as protection against the " artificial stimulation " of the city . To Carlotta , the aging star of bedroom farces , this seems a threat to her very existence , and she soon resents him violently . <P> The Center of the Stage ends indecisively , without the harsh clash that the opposition of Carlotta and David calls for . But while the book is written in too muted a pitch , it is clearly a serious effort to describe , and prescribe for , the Carlottas of this world . Novelist Sykes has an enviable gift for writing cultivated dialogue and intelligent reflection ; his book , even in its limp spots , reveals the controlling presence of a grown-up mind .
