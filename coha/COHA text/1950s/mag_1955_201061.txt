The Air Navigation Development Board last week took the technical wraps off the controversial Tacan ( Tactical Air Navigation ) , electronic distance-direction guide for aircraft . Backed by the Navy and Air Force as a replacement for the Omni-DME ( Omnirange and Distance Measuring Equipment ) system adopted by the Civil Aeronautics Administration in 1948 , Tacan stirred up a storm in the flying industry ( TIME , May 30 ) , but it will probably become the system for all U.S. aircraft . <P> In essence , Tacan and Omni-DME are much alike , but though Tacan and DME use the same ultra-high-frequency radio band ( 960-1215 ) , they can not be read on the same instruments . Both are short-range ( 200 miles ) systems ; both show true distance from the ground station within 500-600 ft . Nevertheless , the new details bring out differences . Tacan can provide compass direction with less than one degree error ; Omni-DME is accurate within three degrees . Tacan , not bothered by superstructure interference or a ship 's roll , is better fitted for Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tacan equipment , an airplane sends out " query " signals to a Tacan ground beacon . The ground beacon , identifying itself in International code ( which the pilot can hear ) , sends out signals in " reply " to the aircraft . To determine distance , the plane 's Tacan continuously measures the time interval between its own " interrogation " signal and the reply , computes the time delay into miles , and indicates the figure on a dial on the instrument board . The same radio pulses are simultaneously performing a more complicated process . To determine direction , the ground beacon 's pulses pass through a revolving ( 15 revolutions per second ) antenna system that relies on two concentric cylindrical rings , one mounted with a single rod-shaped element , the other fitted with nine rods . Whirling around the antenna core , these rods , set at different modulations , " tag " ( modulate ) the signals as they go out . Every time the inner rod passes " zero " ( north ) , a regulating signal is transmitted . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The airplane 's Tacan separates all the signals , computes their differences , and , all without a sound , converts the result into a degree reading on a dial for the pilot to steer by .
