DOROTHY S. BROWN is a grade-school teacher who wants to get a job in the public schools in Elmont township , Nassau County , Long Island , New York . Ray L. Lindbloom , who does n't think she ought to get the job , is the Superintendent of Schools in the Elmont district . Robert A. Thayer comes into this unpleasant story because Mrs. Brown accuses him of pussyfooting , and worse , on the question of whether she deserves the job . This is a serious charge , since Mr. Thayer , as a member of the New York State Commission Against Discrimination , is supposed to see that she gets a fair deal from Mr. Lindbloom . Although her skin is as white as John Rankin 's , her hair a curly auburn , her eyes blue , her nose narrow , Mrs. Brown is a Negro . Her parents were Negroes , and JERRY TALLMER was formerly assistant editor of The Nation . she has always lived as a Negro . She is convinced she was turned down by Mr. Lindbloom for that reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a job in Nassau County public schools . Early this year Mrs. Brown learned that Elmont school officials were looking for some twenty new teachers . To , ward the end of April she talked with one of Mr. Lind-bloom 's assistants and was assured that Mr. Lindbloom would be interested in such a well-qualified candidate . ( Mrs. Brown has a B. Sc . in education from Minor Teachers ' College in Washington , D. C. , extensive credit in graduate worlein education at Howard University  --  like Minor , a well-known Negro institution  --  and at New York University , and eleven years of teaching experience in the public schools of the District of Columbia and a private school in Great Neck , Long Island . ) Several days later she was asked by the principal of the Elmont Road School to come in to see him . He seemed December 30 , 1950 delighted with her record and told her of the two openings in his school . Then he asked her if she would object to teaching Negro children . After all , her Southern accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't object ; you see , I am a Negro . The principal handed her an application blank and brought the interview to an end . A month later he informed her that the two openings had been filled . Mrs. Brown related this experience to a friend , a white woman whose young daughter was then about ready to transfer from kindergarten to grade school in Elmont . The friend asked an acquaintance , another principal in the district , how he would feel about hiring a Negro . He did n't know ; the parents would be against it . But I 'm a parent , she said , and I 'm not against it . You 're just one , he replied . The person you have in mind should meet other parents . So this friend arranged for Mrs. Brown to meet ten or twelve Elmont mothers and fathers . That was the beginning of what Mr. Lindbloom was later to term " a move . . . , of which Mrs. Brown seemed to be a party , to high-pressure her appointment . " On June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elmont parents , Mrs. Brown received a card from New York University saying that her credentials had been forwarded to Mr. Lindbloom at his request . She then called Mr. Lindbloom on the telephone and was granted an appointment for the end of the week . " I did n't go to pick a fight , " she says . " I was n't looking for trouble  --  or for a race problem . " According to Mrs. Brown , Lind-bloom told her that he had received more than one hundred applications just from the seniors at Queens College and that he was interviewing only those candidates whom he was seriously considering . " I asked Mr. Lindbloom if race would have anything to do with my not being considered for the job . He said , ' I will not commit myself on that , but before considering anyone for a job , I would most certainly consider race and religion along with my own personal integrity . ' I do n't know what he meant by that . I saw my credentials before him on his desk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was " impressed with Mrs. Brown 's educational attainments , pleased with many of her personal characteristics , and was considering recommending her for appointment . " Then , the next morning , four of the parents who had met Mrs. Brown called on Lind-bloom . They have since insisted that they just wanted to let the superintendent know how some of the parents in his district felt about Negro teachers . In signed affidavits three of them have declared that Lindbloom told them " he did not feel that the time was right to hire a Negro . . . . Such an act on his part might cause a split in the School Board . " They also say the superintendent " intimated . . . that Mrs. Brown , in his opinion , qualified in all respects for the position but that he did not feel the community was ready for such a step . " Lindbloom has7011 stated : " It is very apparent that Mrs. Brown was not satisfied to have her application passed upon on the merits , but she very deliberately sought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and therefore " declined further consideration " of her application . A few days afterward Mrs. Brown filed a complaint at the office of the State Commission Against Discrimination in New York City . She received a brief acknowledgment from Commissioner Robert H. Thayer on June 16 , returned to his office the following week to give her story to an investigator , and then heard no more from the commission for some time . On July 14 she wrote Thayer : " I was informed today by her white friend that the superintendent of schools in Elmont . . . has taken what I believe to be a retaliatory action against her child in reducing her child to the kindergarten level after she had been informed that the child had been accepted for the first grade . " * She also asked Thayer to advise her what progress had been made on her case . On July 31 she got a reply , not from Thayer , who was then absent on vacation , but from Commissioner Nicholas H. Pinto . His letter indicated that the Commission 's investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to " persuade the school officials that you should be seriously considered for appointment next fall . . . . If I have not succeeded in effecting an adjustment within two weeks , this matter will be taken up by Commissioner Thayer . " TIME passed with no word from the commission . The 1- parents ' group then went to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , which supplied an attorney , Jawn N. Sandifer . At the end of August Mrs. Brown filed a petition with Lindbloom and the Elmont School Board requesting action on her application . In September she asked the State Commissioner of Education in Albany to intervene , but he said he could not take jurisdiction because the local School Board had not made a decision on her application ; the School Board could not act because Mrs. Brown 's name had never been submitted to it . On October 3 Mrs. Brown instituted action in the Nassau County Supreme Court to compel Lindbloom to submit her name to the School Board for its consideration . On October 16 , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown received a brief note from Mr. Thayer asking her to call his secretary for an appointment . Mrs. Brown called , but she is a busy woman and none of Thayer 's free moments seemed to match hers . The court case was argued and a date set to file briefs . On October 26 the Commissioner 's secretary telephoned *The child was eventually accepted in the first grade Her mother would not discuss the incident with me for fear of " bringing further harm to an innocent victim " But Mrs Brown 's statement to Mr. Thayer is a matter of record . 702 The NATION Mrs. Brown . From here on , I had better let Mrs. Brown and Commissioner Thayer tell the story in their own conflicting words . Mrs. Brown : She Mr. Thayer 's secretary called me and asked me to come in again . We still could n't find a convenient time . She said Mr. Thayer would meet me after work in the Great Neck railroad station ! We made the date . I called my lawyer and he said to take along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and up came Mr. Thayer . He was very angry . He said he resented the insinuations in the papers that the commission was n't doing anything on my case . But I had n't seen that insinuation printed anywhere . Then he told me that Mr. Lindbloom was ready to hire a Negro teacher but would n't do it now because of the pressure group behind me. he told me two or three times he washed his hands of the whole thing , that I was wasting my money on a lawyer , that he , Mr. Thayer , would get my case thrown out Of court . He implied that the parents supporting me and the N. A. A. C. P. were all Communists . He said that even after my interview with Lindbloom , Lindbloom sent for my credentials . So I said that the credentials were right there on the Superintendent 's desk when I talked to him . The Commissioner stamped his foot and said , " I will not have you dispute me ! " But I have the postcard from N. Y. U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . I called his attention to my original complaint to the commission , in which I had included the parents ' report of what Lindbloom had said to them . Mr. Thayer said he had never seen their statements . It 's in the complaint , I said . Well , he said , maybe now he would reconsider the case . This was new evidence . Finally , I asked him to tell me the purpose of our meeting . What did he have to say that he could n't have written ? He ignored the question . I think he arranged it because he - wanted to scare me , but I left on top . Commissioner Thayer : I tried to get hold of Mrs. Brown for quite a while . She was always too busy to see me . Well , I thought , I 've got to see she has a complete chance . I live in Glen Cove . I 'll meet her halfway , in Great Neck . We met in the railroad station and went out and sat in my car . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? That is an absolute lie . That I would get the case thrown out of court ? That , too , is an absolute lie , and there is no possible way she could have misunderstood me . I did not tell her she was being victimized by her lawyer or anything like that . As a matter of fact , I asked her whether her lawyer had pointed out to her that her case would quite likely be thrown out of court because her complaint was pending before my commission , and Section 135 of the Ives-Quinn law makes it clear that any pending action within the commission 's jurisdiction is exclusive  --  it excludes any other civil or criminal action based on the same grievance . Later I told her lawyer about this . I am not in a position to characterize pressure groups . But I can say that I know from experience that the minute pressure has been put on anyone , the instinct is for the fellow to draw back . In this business of discrimination you 're dealing with human tensions , human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to handle it carefully and slowly . It requires tremendous patience . Throughout this whole case I 've tried to be fair . If there had been no new evidence , I would have decided this matter then and there in Great Neck . What do I mean by new evidence ? Evidence which was not contained in the file . She gave me evidence she had never given before . I do n't care what she says about my having previous access to such evidence . That is not the fact . As for the length of our investigation , it means nothing . We 've taken two weeks to decide a case  --  or over a year . It depends on circumstances . Has there ever been a Negro teacher in a Nassau County public school ? I 'm sure I do n't know . We have a big Negro population here in Glen Cove , but I do n't know if we have a Negro teacher . ( I checked up on Mr. Thayer later . He plays a leading part each year in the organization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least once . He is also interested in Negro affairs out there and is a strong supporter of Lincoln House , a Negro social-service center . The Negroes in his home town have a high regard for him . ) On November 3 Justice Cortland A. Johnson of the New York Supreme Court decided in favor of Mr. Lindbloom , finding that discrimination had not been demonstrated , that Mrs. Brown had no " clear , legal right to the relief she seeks . " The selection of appointees to the school system , he said , " involves a high degree of discretion  --  and the court does not feel justified upon the record to interfere . " Mrs. Brown 's lawyer says that this is not a great setback to his client . All he wanted was to get the case through the lower court and into the Appellate Division . He will try to show that five other Negroes have been refused teaching jobs in Nassau County public schools . The N. A. A. C. P. , he says , is going to fight for a reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 20 Mrs. Brown wrote Mr. Thayer to notify him that she was withdrawing her complaint before the commission . She wants to remove her case from its " exclusive " jurisdiction . By return mail Mr. Thayer informed her that " the right of a complainant to withdraw a complaint is not an absolute right , but a request to withdraw a. complaint may be accepted or refused in the discretion of the investigating commissioner . Before making any decision with regard to your request , I would appreciate your advising me the reasons for your request . " I have n't bothered to ask Mrs. Brown if and how she 'll answer .
