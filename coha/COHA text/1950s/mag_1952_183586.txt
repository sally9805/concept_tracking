Leonardo da Vinci , Florentine painter , sculptor , architect , inventor , naturalist , writer , was one of the wisest and most universal of men . This spring and summer , to celebrate the sooth anniversary of his birth , a few remaining fruits of Leonardo 's vast labors are being exhibited in England , France , Italy and the U.S. . <P> Leonardo 's name conjures up a heavy-browed , sad , hawk-eyed man , with a straight nose , mouth firm to the point of cruelty , and a flowing silver beard . In contrast to that awesome image of masculine rigor , it also recalls the dark , soft femininity of his most famed creation-the Mono . Lisa . This painting , which hangs in the Louvre , is probably as well known as any in existence-though few admirers pretend to grasp it fully . A portrait of the wife of a Florentine merchant named Francesco del Giocondo , it has been the subject of a towering stack of critical works . Summarizing the comments of the centuries , Johns Hopkins Professor George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age sees the Mono , Lisa in a new way . <P> Subtlety &; Superiority . One critic who saw nothing strange about the Mono , Lisa was the 16th century 's Giorgio Vasari , who praised the painting for its naturalism . " In this head , " Vasari wrote , " every peculiarity that could be depicted by the utmost subtlety of the pencil has been faithfully reproduced . . . Mona Lisa was exceedingly beautiful , and while Leonardo was painting her portrait , he took the precaution of keeping someone constantly near her , to ... amuse her , to the end that she might continue cheerful . " <P> The romance-minded commentators of the i gth century found the lady less cheerful than beguiling . Theophile Gautier wrote that her " sinuous , serpentine mouth , turned up at the corners , in the violet shadows , mocks you with so much gentleness , grace and superiority , that you feel suddenly intimidated , like a schoolboy before a duchess . " <P> Mother &; Mankind . Walter Pater tried to pierce her veils with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among which she sits ; like the vampire , she has been dead many times . . . and , as Leda , was the mother of Helen of Troy , and , as Saint Anne , the mother of Mary ; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes , and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments , and tinged the eyelids and the hands . " <P> In the science-minded 20th century , Sigmund Freud applied psychoanalytical guesswork to the problem . He decided that the Mona Lisa was actually an idealization of Leonardo 's own mother . <P> Through the growing darkness of the little panel wherein she holds court , Mona Lisa keeps smiling silently on mankind . In illuminating one by one her amber facets , the critics have only succeeded in making her more dazzlingly mysterious .
