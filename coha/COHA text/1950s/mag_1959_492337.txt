Looking back today , I can scarcely understand the feelings that led me , almost thirty years ago , to seek an end to my life . I 've done so much growing up since then that the girl I once was  --  so foolish and immature  --  seems like a stranger . I went through a period of utter despair , which I concealed from everyone , including Arthur . Newspapers called my suicide attempt an accident and dismissed it in a couple of paragraphs . Even our neighbors and close friends did n't guess the truth , for was n't I the giddiest young thing and the life of every party ? I was ; yet I thought my life was unbearable . My outlook then seems so ridiculous now , from a mature point of view , that I could cry over that silly young flapper , Katie Murray . I have always loved gay , noisy parties and fun-loving people . At the same time I have a strong sense of duty . Back in 1930 , these conflicting drives  --  to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feelings in turmoil . My days in a small Mount Vernon apartment with two small children seemed endless and dull , especially since a full-time helper left me with little to do . Yet my conscience told me I was neglecting the children if I left them even for an afternoon . Arthur and I were asked to lots of parties . I wanted to attend them all , but during the week Arthur seldom came home before midnight , and on weekends he wanted peace and seclusion . So I would attend the parties alone , feeling guilty , or I would stay home and feel abused . Since Arthur always wanted to talk over the day 's doings when he got home , I would keep myself awake with a novel until I heard his key in the lock at midnight . Then , when I wanted him to tell me how much he adored mc , he spoke of new sales gimmicks and daily grosses . What a familiar story it is !

I felt , foolishly , that I had no real share in Arthur 's life ; as for the twins , they had each other . What was I contributing ? Nothing . Who needed mc ? Nobody . The notion that I was a kind of useless ( Continued on Page 68 ) ( Continued from Page 37 ) parasite , added to my boredom and unhappiness , made me feel completely unnecessary . Unlike my father , who showered my beautiful mother with attentions , Arthur is not a demonstrative person . I ca n't remember him ever calling me " dear " or " sweetheart " or any pet name . It 's not even " Kate " ; it 's " Kathryn , " and when he thinks I 'm being bossy he calls me " Madam . " Like most men , Arthur shows his love in actions , not in words . How much heartache I endured before I saw this ! As a bnde I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked business with me until two and three in the morning . That was his way of showing me how much he valued my opinion and how much he wanted me to share his life . But I did n't understand . My suicide attempt took place one evening in September , 1930 , after we had returned from a picnic with some families living in our Mount Vernon apartment house . It was during prohibition , and I can remember drinking homemade wine  --  not much , but even one drink makes me dull , depressed and misty-headed . Feeling sick , when we got back to our apartment , 1 went into the bathroom and locked the door . That is the last thing I remember . The window was rather high up and small . I must have climbed up on a chair , opened it and jumped out . In the next room , Arthur heard shouts and commotion outside on the lawn . He leaned out the window and saw me three stories below , stretched out unconscious on my back . The next thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've always been afraid of the dark ; I was frightened now and said , " Who are you ? " " I 'm your nurse . You 're in the Mount Vernon Hospital . " Then I relapsed into unconsciousness . For days 1 lay flat on my stomach while Arthur brought up a parade of specialists from New York to examine me . I was too full of dope to be conscious of very much , but I remember the day Dr. Benjamin Farrell came , an elderly man who has since died . I could n't turn my head to see him , but I liked the sound of his voice and the sure , gentle touch of his fingers . I told Arthur I wanted him to do the operation on my fractured spine , and I was moved to the Orthopaedic Hospital in New York . The little knobs on the human spine are called " processes . " Doctor Farrell 's special technique was an operation called a fusion , which means that the processes are removed with a hammer and chisel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed along the broken segment of the spine . After the patient has spent weeks of total immobility , nature fuses the backbone together . The operation took three and a half hours . Arthur stood in the viewer 's section reserved for medical students and watched the surgeon 's deft maneuvers , knowing that one slip of the chisel could sever my spinal cord . When the operation was safely over , we were told it would be weeks before we knew whether I could ever walk again . No one could have had a more loving or devoted husband than I had during the long months of my convalescence . Arthur came to the hospital twice a day , morning and evening . The twins , who were curly-headed darlings of four , cane on Sundays . I was incased in a rigid brace that extended from shoulders to hips . 1 could move my head , but that was all . Arthur rigged up a special device to hold a book , but I found that my eyes tired very quickly reading at that angle . Mostly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair . I thought I had sentenced myself to a wheel chair for life . But gradually , as the doctors expressed satisfaction with my progress , I began to hope . Now all my thoughts were directed toward becoming whole and well . I vowed that if only I could move and walk and dance once more , I would never yield again to mental depression . I had the same day nurse for five months : if I had it to do over again I 'd change nurses every week . We got so edgy that we fought over who would eat the lamb chops . But she had a lot of salty talcs about life in a small Minnesota town that dried my tears of self-pity . One was about an ambitious mother who wanted her daughter to be an opera star and fretted constantly about her straining her voice . Whenever the daughter let herself go with the church choir , the mother would stand up at her pew and scream , " Do n't strain yourself , Elsie ! " That has become our favorite family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arthur 's visits to the hospital he bent over to greet me with a kiss , and I felt a wad of paper in his coat pocket . I asked , " What on earth do you have in there ' ? " and it seemed to me that he was evasive . Jealousy struck -- I demanded to see the papers he was carrying , and as 1 thumbed through them I came across a telephone number in a girl 's handwriting . Arthur claimed he could n't remember whose number he was carrying . 1 did n't believe him . Finally he tried to clear himself by phoning the number in my presence . I heard him say , " Hello . I am Arthur Murray of the Arthur Murray School of Dancing , and I 've forgotten why I have your telephone number in my pocket . " There was a pause . Evidently someone else had been called to the phone because Arthur went through the same spiel again . Then I saw him grin . He handed me the phone . I heard a woman say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle washers , and we do n't want no dance lessons ! " The phone number belonged to a restaurant-bakery near the hospital where Arthur had stopped to buy some cookies for me . He had asked for the phone number to use for future orders . I spent Christmas and New Year 's in the hospital . In February I came home . For a year afterward I was afraid to lean over , and I brushed my teeth bending from the knees . Later I found I could bend forward . Although the small of my back is still rigid today , 1 can do practically any dance step except a deep backward arch . Arthur did not want to take me back to our old apartment , so we bought a pretty , white Georgian house in Harrison , New York . It had two guest rooms , which Arthur filled with New York friends every weekend in an attempt to cheer me up . But I had learned my lesson ; 1 thanked God 1 was n't a hopeless cripple , and I looked on each new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of the depression , with banks failing , able-bodied men selling apples , the carriage class stunned by misfortune , It took all of Arthur 's ingenuity and courage to keep going . Our studio space shrank from six entire floors to two , and our rates for dance lessons were cut in half . Arthur talked business with me half the night , wondering how to attract more students . Arthur has always spent heavily for advertising . He has to , since we do not grow by word-of-mouth recommendations , like other service industries . Americans who take dance lessons  --  particularly the men  --  like to keep it a secret . Why is this true ? Compared to European men , Americans really need instruction in dancing . When Arthur and I were abroad we ( Continued on Page 72 ) P 0 s ' t ( Conthinnifrom NO found I ontlim crammed with dance halls , andCopenhagen 100 , all doing a In ely trade , v.

When our first German studio was opened in Frankfurt , we expected mainly women student , , since the war len that city with twice as many women LIS men . We also expected many Americans from the big United States Army installation . To our surprise , the majority of lesson takers were men , and German . American tourists , startled to see the big neon sign in downtown Frankfurt , ARTHUR attlitRAV TANZ ScHULE , are further amused when they step inside and ... ee a pretty , blue-eyed teacher counting crisply to her German partner , " Ein , zwei , drei , eha-ehat " " European men come to the studio under their own steam and learn for their own pleasure , " says Ethel Fistere , who opened the Frankfurt studio . " In the States a man enrolls for dancing lessons because his wife or sister or mother has persuaded him , or because he figures it will help him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign to make good dancers of American business and professional men would have to be subtle . For instance , no man w ill admit he 's taking dancing lessons  --  but he wo n't mind saying that he 's taking rumba lessons . It 's like the difference between saying your feet hurt and your foot hurts . Arthur addressed businessmen with dignified ads which ran in leading New York newspapers and business journals : " Does your dancing say ' New York ' or ' small town ' ? Where do the fastidious satisfy their craving for the up-to-the-minute dance steps and instruction ? A secret ? ... On the contrary , they happily pass the word about Arthur Murray 's delightfully modern studios , where chic meets chic , " Pictures of six pretty Arthur Murray girls , with captions explaining their good social backgrounds , illustrated the advertisement . The ad was noticed by E. B. White , who gently satirized it in The New Yorker : He wrote : I am as good material as any dance studio could hope for . Clumsy , awkward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no Tuxedo .... Yet what comes of it all ? I look at Arthur Murray 's six dance instructors and I simply ca n't make up my mind which one I want .... How can I choose one girl from that lovely galaxy , esen though I cruse the definite air of distinction , the subtle sophistication , the youthful vivacity which would characterize my dancing were Ito register at Arthur Murray 's ? ... I 'll never be able to narrow my choice down to one dance instructor . I think what better do is have all the girls down to my place some afternoon for cocktails . No , not you , Mr. Murray  --  just the girls and me Any time after five-thirty . Dancing . Recently he wrote to me , " Your husband , whom I have encountered only on television , is one of the few men I truly envy , as he takes you and glides away across the floor with no mistakes , no hesitation , nothing but grace , felicity and delight . I should have grabbed Barbara Foltz Pone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to dance  --  it must be the perfect way to get rid of life 's vapors . " It still is n't too late , Mr. White . Come over any time . No cocktails , though . Arthur 's advertisements , which he wrote himself , were so succet'sful that by the mid- ' 30 's 65 r el.1 of our students were men . While on a visit to the United Slates , President QUefon of the Philippines took lessons twice a day . I owell Thomas , Col. " Wild Bill " Donovan , Ben Bernie and Walter O'Keefe came regularly . The doughty Arctic explorer , Lincoln Ellsworth , slipped up to the studios in a back elevator , his dancing shoes concealed in a paper hag . Hattie Carnegie , New York t+11111thire. took lessons in a cubicle nest to one where instruction was being given to Mr. Klein , owner of the famous cut-rate store on 14th Street . Barbara I Raton came for lessons and proved to he an exquisite dancer . Photographer Margaret Bourke-White found dancing the perfect way to relax after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Elizabeth Arden and Mrs. Floyd Odium , then president of Bonwit Teller . One career woman came for eight or nine years and became one of our closest friends  --  Mary E. Dillon , president of the Brooklyn Borough Gas Company . She spent many family vacations with us and got to know us well . Of course . Arthur has been meeting well-known people for many years . While he was teaching dancing in Atlanta , he met political bigwigs and financiers . All of the visiting Metropolitan Opera stars stayed at the Georgian Terrace , and many took lessons from him  --  Enrico Caruso , Rosa Ponselle and others . When he first tried to leach dancing by mail , William Jennings Bryan advised him , " Send out instructions for the left foot first , and do n't send the right foot until they pay up ! " Unlike Arthur , I was not used to celebrities when we married . It was Mary Dillon who taught me how to be comfortable in a roomful of strangers . " Do n't barge up to a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be on the outside , " she said . " Instead , approach someone who 's standing by himself , looking bored and unhappy . Introduce yourself and concentrate on making him smile , You 'll forget your self-consciousness , and soon your twosome will attract a circle . " I tried it , and it always works . As the financial depression deepened in the ' 30 's , we acquired a baroness , several countesses and a Russian prince on the staff . But Arthur made a strict rule that titles could not be used . The student , he said , must always be more important than the instructor . Now he needed to reach out for new sources of pupils and persuaded big New York department stores to give their employees lessons during their lunch hour . We had special " gym " rates for those who wanted to exercise as they brushed up their dancing , and two-for-one rates where couples shared a single teacher . At one time we had as many as eighty teams of dancing teachers on cruise ships and at resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel to attract tourists to Bermuda during the depression , twenty of our teachers were invited to live there as guests of the hotel and , incidentally , enliven the place , It was then a pale pink stucco palace , set among dark green cedars and commanding a sweeping view of the harbor . Everything was in period French , from the Aubusson carpets to the silk shades of the boudoir lamps . The chefs were imported from Le Touquct . Few of our teachers had ever known such luxury . I recall an engaging young Irish boy whose experience in dining out had been limited to cafeterias . He ordered corn flakes for breakfast . The maitre d'h  --  tel told the headwaiter , who told the captain , who told the assistant waiter , who told the bus boy , who disappeared into the kitchen . After a long wait , a dish of corn flakes actually appeared  --  an entire boxful presented in a large silver fruit bowl . During the depression years we sent several teams of dancers to Palm Beach in charge of Herb Richards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stockbroker . Herb 's charm and good manners made him welcome at Palm Beach parties , and he and his teachers were invited to one fabulous mansion after another . Mrs. Henry Flagler , wife of the railroad magnate , thanked Herb for her lessons by a gift of a large ear . Our teachers often receive small remembrances from pupils , but Herb is the only teacher I know who ever received an automobile . Gifts received by Arthur Murray girls are usually handkerchiefs , scarves or perfume , but a butcher once handed his teacher a beautiful raw beefsteak , and one salesman gave his pretty instructor a fire extinguisher . Arthur was suspicious : Was there a leer here ? Although Arthur has always frowned upon romances between pupils and teachers , several Arthur Murray girls have married well-known people . Eleanor Searle married Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney . Instructor Helen Berrien , a wealthy New York society girl , married Burgess Meredith . Writer James Jones is married to an Arthur Murray girl , and TV and Broadway star Neva Patterson married an Arthur Murray teacher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air conditioning , our studios practically closed down in summer . So Arthur took the family on three-month vacations . After my recovery from a broken back he drove us into the wilds of Canada , to a resort hotel at Murray Bay . One of the hotel guests , a French surgeon from Quebec , immediately wanted Arthur to give him private lessons . To discourage him , my husband quoted a rate of fifty dollars an hour . The surgeon hurried off . A few days later I came down with acute appendicitis . There was no hospital within a hundred miles . Arthur called on the Quebec surgeon to perform an emergency operation , which he did : acting as assistant , Arthur held a small table lamp over my abdomen . The surgeon , who had not forgotten that Arthur asked fifty dollars an hour for dance lessons , presented a monumental bill . All the guests left , the hotel was boarded up for the winter , and still we lingered on , shivering in the early Canadian winter until I could he safely moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bargaining for silver-fox skins , and bought enough hand-knit ski sweaters to outfit the entire population of Saint Moritz . He can seldom resist a bargain . During the ( Continued on Page74 ) ( C'entiroitea " from Page 72 ) depression , when many luxury shops were folding , he really went overboard . Once he brought time 100 diamond engagement rings , with he lame excuse that we could give them to leachers who got engaged . Another auction yielded a couple of hunched tiny unset diamonds that arc still rattling around somewhere . But 1 really hit the ceiling when he lugged home a genuine Russian altarpiece , which he thought would look ' dee as a decoration in our living room . Forty bcllpulls from medieval Italian castles and several dozen fringed piano throws , he said , would suit the studio , which then had an Italian decor . Arthur 's greatest passion is for watches which he buys wholesale by the gross , mostly to use as gifts . He has the slogan , IT 'S ARTHUR MURRAY TIME , embossed on the faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful timepiece I could lied . 1 chose a wafer-thin platinum wrist watch and had it suitably engraved . But the week before Christmas Arthur came home with 400 wrist watches . My $1000 gift lies in a drawer because he prefers to wear watches bought wholesale for $8.50 with a year 's guarantee . As soon as anything goes wrong with a watch , he discards it and selects another from a desk drawer crammed with them . Arthur 's watch buying once inspired a top TV comedy writer named Aaron Rubin to make a crack which has since been adapted to hundreds of jokes . We were watching Martha Raye rehearse a skit for our show in which she tossed together a crazy kind of salad . Miss Raye threw a toupee into the lettuce , then a shoe , then asked , " Anybody got a watch ? " " Why , yes , " spoke up Arthur helpfully . " I have four hundred in a closet over at the studio . " Everyone was struck dumb . Finally Aaron Rubin remarked nonchalantly , " Does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has turned into a business advantage . During the ' 30 's we started a studio magazine called Murray-GoRound , and one of the people who wanted to be editor was young Jules Levine , a smart boy just out of City College . Jules came to apply for the job with a scrapbook bulging with jokes and gags . His collection gave Arthur an idea which launched a new routine in press-agentry . He told young Jules to send jokes to the columnists , crediting them to Arthur : he would pay for each item that got printed . Nowadays this kind of nonsense fills the gossip columns . Arthur soon had not one press agent but six of them at a time . Some of them , like Norman Krasna , Monte Prosser , Maurice Zolotow , Alex Gottlieb , Dave Alber and Bert Nevins are famous now . The Broadway and Hollywood gossip columns were so full of quips by Arthur Murray that columnist Robert Sylvester began referring to him sarcastically as " the funniest man in the world . " Then Bob Hope made that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to take dancing lessons from Arthur Murray until 1 found it was more fun dancing with a girl . " Another perennial favorite is , " I took lessons from Charles Atlas and Arthur Murray . The trouble is , now 1 dance like Charles Atlas and look like Arthur Murray , " My pet is , " My girl won the Arthur Murray award . " " For dancing ? " " No , for looking the most like Arthur M array . " For items landed in newspapers , Arthur pays press agents from $50 to $100 apiece , depending on how many papers carry it . One of his publicists makes $1000 a week from Arthur Murray quips alone . Arthur has cut down lately ; he now employs only four press agents . When he has n't seen his name in print fora what he phones them and asks , " What happened to my sense of humor ? " For television and radio plugs , Arthur usually pays off in gifts  --  a case of whisky , for example . One well-known comedian was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on him . His opening Three-minute spiel often contained as many as four plugs for four different businesses in a single sentence . Often comedians mention Arthur Murray on the networks because for some reason the name alone makes people laugh . Does this sell more dance lessons ? Arthur says no , but he keeps on paying handsomely to keep his name before the public . One thing that helps is his willingness to search out new dances . In 1934 , returning by ship from a tour of Sweden and England , Arthur taught a new one to the Leonard Lyonses . This was the Lambeth Walk , and we sent teachers to all the big New York hotels to popularize it .. ? When Arthur heard about a southern dance called the Big Apple , he sent teachers to North Carolina , where they watched the dance in an old country barn . There was n't much to it originally , so Arthur added enough steps to make it fun to do and colorful to watch . He trained groups of youngsters in the dance , outfitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Statler hotels hire his groups to entertain . Before the craze died down , Arthur had teachers giving dance lessons in hotels in all the major cities . This was really the origin of our branch studios , most of which started in Statler hotels . Arthur worked out a deal for our teachers much as he had done in Ashe-ville and Atlanta years before . The hotels gave the instructors free room and board , and rooms for dance lessons in return for a percentage of the take ; all that the instructors needed to go into business was a phonograph and a stack of records . Cy Andrews and Doris Eaton , one of our resort dancing teams , were the first to ask Arthur for a franchise to open a studio . Doris had been a musical-comedy star , and while teaching for us in Florida had met the Henry Fords and other Grosse Pointe families . She and Cy Andrews decided they could do well with a dance studio in Detroit . They promised to follow Arthur 's advice and instructions and give him 10 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their ability , he agreed . That summer we visited Hollywood for the first time , tempted by stories of fun , glamour and sunshine we had heard from Leonore and Ira Gershwin . We were a novelty in the film colony , and after twelve years of being a Westchester County housewife , I found myself a celebrity in a small way . I thrived on excitement . Arthur was delighted by the change in me , and since he hates cold weather he , loo , was attracted by life on the Coast . After he had granted ten more franchises , he decided he could run both the New York studio and our branches by remote control . It was 1938 ; he reached his forty-third birthday and decided to retire . We hurried east , sold out Harrison house and furniture , gave away our winter clothes and headed for California with the twins and a couple of suitcases . We moved into the plush Beverly Hills Hotel and settled down to enjoy a life of fun and companionship .
