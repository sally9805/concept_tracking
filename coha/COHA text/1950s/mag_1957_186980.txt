" I 'm an old campaigner , " growled House Republican Leader Joe Martin , " and when I want votes , I go after ' em . Now Sam 's an old campaigner too . When he needs votes , he 'll go after them too . " In jockeying for position on the first U.S. civil rights bill since Reconstruction , Martin and Democrat Sam Rayburn had gone after votes so skillfully that they were deadlocked . Result : late last week , after days of glaring at each other from a distance , the old campaigners were forced to get together on a compromise of a compromise of a compromise . <P> The week began with this tactical situation : the civil rights bill , with the Senate amendment requiring jury trials in all criminal contempt cases , was stuck fast in the House Rules Committee and needed G.O.P. votes to bring it out . But Joe Martin , who is not even certain that he has any Negroes in his district ( " I 've seen one or two of them on the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall the names of any of them " ) , was determined to place a Republican stamp on what then stood as a Democratic bill . Said Martin : <P> <P> " We 're not at all interested in pushing a Democratic bill through , particularly when it does not provide anything . " <P> Strong Kidneys . Martin persuaded the four Republican members of the Rules Committee to hold out against the Senate bill , set New York 's Republican Representative Kenneth Keating to working out a party position on the bill with Acting Attorney General Bill Rogers . Then Joe Martin , who ordinarily confers a dozen or so times a day with his old friend Sam Rayburn , announced that he was not on " talking terms " with " Mr. Rayburn . " <P> With everyone on Capitol Hill wondering when they would get together , the two entered on a war of nerves , each refusing to go to the other . Said Martin : " I would n't be so presumptuous as to see the Speaker on a subject like this . I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never locked . I 'm always glad to see Mr. Martin or any other member of the House . " How long would the waiting game go on ? Grinned Joe Martin : " My kidneys are good . " <P> Deep Stuff . Martin did not even send Rayburn the proposal worked out by Keating and Rogers . Instead , newsmen handed Sam a copy . He read it once , grunted , read it again , then again and again , finally announced : " This is very deep stuff . I 'll have to have a little more time to digest it . " Whereupon he disappeared into his office , taking with him four fellow Texans to aid in the digestive process . The Republicans ' " deep stuff " : 1 ) the contempt of court provisions of the bill would apply to violations of voting rights only , and not to all criminal contempt cases , as the Senate bill provided ; 2 ) in criminal contempt cases based on denial of the right to vote , federal judges would be allowed to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $300 , but jury trials would be required for greater penalties .
