 | YESTERDAY HOPELESSLY ILL TODAY CURED ALIVE TODAY 1S a growing army of people who just a few years ago might have died despite the dedicated efforts of their doctors . They were not saved by the magic of any individual wonder drug ; rather , they were salvaged from the ranks of the doomed by a combination of ingenuity , daring and faith that highlights medicine 's amazing new power . For example . In 1950 a little boy was brought into Highland-Alameda County Hospital in Oakland , Calif. , critically ill with peritonitis following a ruptured appendix . Despite huge doses of antibiotics over 24 hours , the boy was all but dead ? overwhelmed not only by microbes but by the poisons of the inflammation within him . Now , to the already large doses of antibiotics , Dr. Laurance W. Kinsell and his associates added injections of heroic doses of the new pituitary hormone , ACTH . This was scientific heresy : the hormone that cooled inflammation might also aggravate microbic invasion . But after one day of this combination treatment the boy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been sick at all . Hormone injections were stopped ; within two days the boy once more was close to death . Again for two days the hormones fortified continuing doses of antibiotics . This time the boy stayed well . Inflammation now extinguished , the antibiotics  | alone defeated the microbes and the boy improved sufficiently to stand an operation ; surgeons could then complete the cure by removing a remaining abscess . During the past five years at Oakland this double-barreled science has been a last-ditch hope for more than 300 patients desperately ill not only with peritonitis but with pneumonia , pneumococcus meningitis or deadly meningococcus blood poisoning . In many hospitals this treatment is now routine for the hopelessly infected . The hormones ACTH and cortisone , used briefly , buy time for dying patients so that antibiotics can go on by themselves to save their lives . Persistent use of a remedy that seems to have failed may result in cure after all hope seems gone . Dr. William G. Lennox of Boston , famed authority on epilepsy , reports the strange rescue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a bright , healthy boy ; at age four , epileptic seizures had reduced him to a state less than human . Despite the use of half a dozen new medicines , electroencephalograms showed his brain apparently badly damaged , and the boy was taken home with the understanding that the end was not far off . But Dr. Lennox kept giving Dilantin ? a remedy controlling 8o percent of less serious epilepsy ? to this continuously convulsing boy for whom it had failed completely . In a month , his convulsions began to fade . Mysteriously and miraculously the Dilantin had begun to take hold . Six weeks later Stephen was laughing , talking , playing , and Dr. Lennox found him mentally alert , brain waves normal . For three years now Stephen has been as if he 'd had no epilepsy ever . A patient 's faith in his doctor may carry him through years of new , hazardous treatments to a happy ending . Some seven years ago a man was smitten by a breaking out of blisters , inside and all over the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a death sentence . Dr. Marion B. Sulzberger of New York City started giving him dangerous doses of hormones ACTH and cortisone . These hormones drove the patient insane , as they may do in some patients when used in large , long-continued doses . But his insanity was controlled by temporary reduction of hormone dosage and by electroshocks . Later , increased hormones gradually dried up his deadly blisters . The hormones also removed calcium from his bones ; orthopedic surgeons had to install a metal hip-joint socket in order for him to get around . Under his continuing severe treatment his gall bladder went bad . During the operation that followed , he went into collapse ; increased doses of hormones were all that saved his life . Finally came what the doctor hoped for in the face of no hope : the man had been kept alive long enough so that his own body defeated the deadly pemphigus . Now , with little or no hormone treatment ,  | is well , happy , working hard , the father of two fine children . ' tragically , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate . An example is inlet tious hepatitis ? inflammation of the liver ? which , though not generally fatal , can become chronic and end in death . Against it sulfas and antibiotics are powerless . In the past five years many scientific papers report new hope from hormones . Dr. ' i lliam S. Reveno of Detroit , one of the pioneer observers of this treatment , had a patient for whom death seemed to be round the corner . Her acute hepatitis had turned chronic , destroying her liver 's ability to make the prothromhin that guards against hemorrhage . Covered with hemorrhagic blotches and bleeding contantly from her intestines , she was iven up for gone . Dr. Reveno , recognizing that hormones are no cure for anything , just he same gave the dying woman CTH and cortisone with the hope hey might help normalize her inflamed liver . In a few days her hemorrhages vanished ; her color became healthy pink ; she ate ravenously . For the past four years she has lived vigorously , guarded by daily hornwnes and protected from the dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From New York City , Dr. Shepard Shapiro reports the rescue of a 00 Oman , in 1953 , from a double threat of death . She had been brought to the hospital in collapse with excruciating chest pain . The case was diagnosed as coronary thrombosis . Through the day , under oxygen , she improved a bit , but in the evening there was another attack of pain ; her breathing became fast and shallow , her lips blue ; she coughed and spat up blood . Her blood had stagnated following the heart attack , and clots formed in her veins ; a fragment of clot had been lodged in her right lung , adding the peril of lung embolism . With gasping breath she hovered between life and death . How to stop further blood-clot danger ? First , Dr. Shapiro injected the emergency anti-coagulant , heparin . Then he began giving her the new long-acting anti-coagulant , Coumadin sodium , discovered by Dr. Karl Paul Link of the University of Wisconsin . Within hours the woman 's breathing was normal . Under daily doses of Coumadin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of bed . Today she is keeping house again . Now that Coumadin sodium has made it safe for physicians to delay blood coagulation , they are starting this medicine in heart attacks as soon as the diagnosis is made or even suspected . They do not wait for dangerous lung embolisms to occur ; they prevent them . Today 's death fighters refuse to admit defeat despite disappointment with successive remedies ; against tuberculosis their spirit of never-saydie is bringing fantastic saving of  | lives . Ten years ago streptomycin was the antibiotic hope for wiping out the white plague . But its longcontinued use revealed danger to patients , and TB microbes became resistant to it . Then to streptomycin 's aid came two other chemicals : para-amino-salicylic acid ? P.A.S. ? and isoniazid , a drug developed by Hoffmann-La Roche and Squibb Laboratories independently . With this triple medicine the death rate of lung TB began to tumble . But it is against a far more deadly form of the disease that the new combination shows truly awesome power . A few years ago , TB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these patients are brought to the hospital in a terminal coma , big doses of the triple medicine start the majority back to useful life . If-they can only be kept alive 21 days after beginning the therapy , they will survive . They must still take the triple medicine for months , but ultimately they get well and stay so . It is the addition of isoniazid to streptomycin and P.A.S . that has solidified the recovery of these doomed . In 394 cases of TB meningitis , Dr. Donald C. Young of Herman Kiefer Hospital , Detroit , reports a survival rate , for 1956 , of 87.9 percent . Up from zero ten years ago ! Today 's avalanche of medical discovery encourages doctors to be dauntless . Dr. Leo Loewe of New York City records the history of woman as good as dead three time and each time resurrected . In 194 he saved her from death from subacute bacterial endocarditis by ma sive penicillin treatment that has re versed this ill from surely fatal t ? too percent potentially curable . Fo ten years she stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of blood and i 1956 she was again at death 's doo with heart failure . It was imperativ to find a heart surgeon who 'd ope ate upon this maximum poor ris patient . At last , in Philadelphia , D C. P. Bailey , his index finger armed with a tiny knife , groped inside th beating heart of the dying woma and removed masses of calciu from her heart valve . This new , amazing surgery r. stored blood flow and the woma lived . But in a month she bega again to go downhill with a post operative complication : she coul not tolerate cortisone-type hormon that might have a chance to give he strength . But a new hormone , triamcinolone ( trade name : Arist cort ) arrived in the nick of time t. save her . Now she is at her old-time full vi or in household and social activities " It 's really something to see her , ' says Dr. Loewe , " ? alive , though three times doomed .
