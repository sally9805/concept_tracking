Were it not for the Christmas spirit , U.S. publishing would be a far less prosperous enterprise than it is . This year the trade is ready once again for the growing number of people whose gift problems seem to be most easily resolved by handsome , outsize volumes , preferably loaded with pictures . A sampling of the current product : <P> A CURRIER &; IVES TREASURY , edited by Colin Simkin ( Crown ; $10 ) , contains 80 prints in color , generous in size ( 10 in. by 14 in. ) , and calculated to hasten the pulse of anyone devoted to forthright Americana . <P> THE SELECTIVE EYE , edited by Georges and Rosamond Bernier ( 193pp. ; Random House ; $7.95 ) , presents material from France 's outstanding art magazine L'Oeil ( The Eye ) and ranges over world art , past and present .

The drawings especially still have an attraction , mostly gruesome , that is hard to resist . <P> THE BOOK OF THE MOUNTAINS , edited by A. C. Spectorsky ( 492 pp. ; Apple-ton-Century-Crofts ; $10 ) , might seem to leave ex-Exurbanite Author Spectorsky ( TIME , Nov. 7 ) hanging over a crevasse after the year 's avalanche of good books on mountaineering .
