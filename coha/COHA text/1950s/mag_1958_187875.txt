The Houston school board , which runs the nation 's largest ( 159,200 students ) segregated school system , last week found itself in an unsettling situation-its newest member , 42-year-old Mrs. Hattie Mae White , is a Negro . A former public school teacher and mother of five children , Mrs. White startled Houston citizens when she announced her candidacy ten weeks ago . She was written off as a crusading eccentric when she ignored a vacant seat on the school board , decided instead to run against Board Member Dr. John K. Glen , a staunch segregationist . <P> At the outset , the liberal Houston Association of Better Schools , of which Mrs. White is a member , proved itself not quite liberal enough to ignore her race , refused to endorse her candidacy . But a milk-bottle collection in Houston 's Negro districts boosted funds to some $4,000 , and Candidate White began a hard campaign . Pointedly , she talked of issues , e.g. , Houston schoolchildren pay 4 more a half-pint for lunchtime milk than children in surrounding districts because the hyperconservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not orate for integration . But she visited Negro schools , some of which lack libraries , cafeterias , permanent buildings , reported wryly : " I have found them very separate , but not quite equal . " <P> Last week Moderate White won a handy victory over Segregationist Glen . That she outpulled her opponent in a surprising number of white districts holds real hope for Houston ; almost inevitably during her four-year term , the city will have to choose between integration and the educational atrophy of a Little Rock .
