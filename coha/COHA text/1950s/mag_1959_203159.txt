The 44-year-old housewife in the emergency room of St. Joseph 's Hospital in Syracuse was in deep shock from massive internal bleeding . The problem : to find its source as fast as possible . Italian-born Dr. Goffredo G. Gensini buttonholed a visitor , Radiologist Charles Dotter from the University of Oregon . Dr. Dotter sterilized the G string of a guitar , punctured the main artery in the woman 's thigh . then-watching the steel 's progress under the fluoroscope-worked it up into the aorta , the body 's main artery . When it was close to the heart , he slipped a thin polyethylene tube over the dangling end , worked this up the artery , using the steel string as a guide , then withdrew the guide . Radiopaque dye injected through the tube showed , on X rays , a ruptured kidney artery . Removal of the damaged kidney and connected artery saved the patient 's life . <P> Simple &; Safe . Last week Drs . Dotter and Gensini told the Radiological Society of North America that steel-string and steel-spring techniques can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart itself-into the left ventricle , which pumps fresh blood to the entire body. * Pioneered in Sweden and France , the method has been adopted by Dr. Dotter in the hope of replacing techniques that , says he , were neither " simple , safe , nor reliable . " <P> As used so far in 70 cases by Dr. Dotter in Portland and in 30 by Dr. Gensini in Syracuse , the procedure begins with insertion of a thick , hollow needle ( under local anesthetic ) into the femoral artery . Through the needle the diagnostician passes a flexible steel spring , like a plumber 's snake ( or like the bass strings of pianos and guitars ) . The needle is soon withdrawn . Inside the steel spring is a single-strand steel wire for stiffening . As in the Syracuse housewife 's case , polyethylene tubing is slipped over the steel spring . But in her case , the doctors did not go beyond the aorta . Now they go around the aorta 's arch ( see diagram ) to its end at the aortic valve-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advance . By pulling back an inch or two of the stiffening wire , they leave some of the spring pressing against the aortic valve . When the valve 's leaves open to let blood out , the tensed spring pushes through , taking the polyethylene tube with it . With the end of this tube in the ventricle , the spring is withdrawn . Diagnosticians can then take samples of blood for a variety of tests , check pressure inside the ventricle , and inject radiopaque dyes for X rays to reveal abnormal or damaged arteries . <P> Admittedly crusaders for what the profession calls " left ventriculography , " Drs . Dotter and Gensini believe that the technique is safe enough to be used in a physician 's office . Some cardiologists believe it still advisable to have the patient in a hospital . But they agree that if experience proves the method safe , it will be a great advance over punching a big needle through the chest wall and into the heart itself to get inside the left ventricle . <P> <P> * The right side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver used blood to it .
