Hope rose last week for a truce in Colombia 's bitter religious strife . A Colombian Catholic , Jos Maria Chaves , 29 , now teaching at Queens College , New York , and worried about anti-Protestant violence in his homeland , suggested a formula for peace . Its gist : Protestants should agree to a missionary quota , stop publicizing persecution unless new attacks occur , limit preaching to churches , avoid attacking Catholic dogmas and priests . The Roman Catholic Church and the pro-Catholic government should agree to denounce and punish anti-Protestant assaults , guarantee freedom of worship . <P> Such an agreement , Chaves hoped , would make the missions of some 30,000 Protestants acceptable in the predominantly Catholic country of 11 million , and cool off inflamed passions which have , during the past three years , brought death to 25 Protestants , hundreds of attacks on them , and the stoning , burning and dynamiting of their churches . <P> In Bogot , Foreign Minister Juan Uribe Holguin promised a government statement on Chaves ' plan . Most Colombia Protestants seemed likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom or martyrdom . Colombia 's Catholic hierarchy would probably cast the decisive vote for or against tolerance .
