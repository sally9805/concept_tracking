" They are , but I 'm very strict with them , " said Mary . " I did n't know you had a nurse for him . " " The nurse is for me . Rowland was quite a lot of trouble . " " But I did n't know that , Mary . " " I know you did n't . Alfred did n't want you to know , and the only reason I 'm telling you now is because I do n't want you to think we were selfish , not to bring the baby here sooner . They kept me in the hospital for an extra two weeks . " " But you must be all right now , or Alfred would n't have gone so far away . " " I am , but I still get tired easily . And I do n't want to drop the baby on the floor . " " Heavens , no . " " The next time I 'm going to have a Caesarean , if there is a next time . " " There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . " " Your flowers are lovely . " " We 've had a very good year with everything . I have a new man , an Italian .. You 've never seen our greenhouse close to , have you ? " " Oh , yes . The first time I was here . " " Oh , but this new man has it filled , filled . He 's done a lot of transplanting . Pays no attention to what I say , but the results are worth it . He speaks hardly any English and I do n't know any Italian . " " Yes , I 've been to the greenhouse . That was the day I was really sure I loved Alfred . " " What in the world is he doing in Texas ? Texas , that 's just over the border from Mexico , and somehow Mexico seems farther away than Russia . " " It 's a business trip . He has a friend there he met in the Navy named Jack Tom Smith . Alfred wants to buy out the Thorntons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I can tell you . " " It has n't been going well ? " " Swimmingly for a while , after their first row . Jack Tom is coming North in September for the polo matches , but Alfred vlanted to see him before that . He 's immensely rich and he loves Alfred . If Alfred ca n't buy out the Thorntons and Lex , I 'm afraid he 's going to resign . The whole trouble is Larry Von Elm . He 's turned Lex against Alfred and the two of them run up bills and Alfred has to find the money to pay the bills without going to Fritz Thornton . He knows Fritz Thornton would be on his side , like he was a year ago , but Alfred does n't want to be a tattle-tale . " " He never was . He always kept his troubles to himself . Too much so . " " I know . But he said the only thing to do is raise the necessary money and then go to Fritz Thornton again and say either the corporationis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Then why does he want the money ? " " To buy out the Thorntons . If he has control , Lex will have to do as he says , and so will Larry Von Elm . The way it is now , Alfred ca n't help feeling that it 's Lex 's money in a way , and it is . But he is n't very hopeful . Oh , he 's sure he can get Jack Tom to pledge the money , but he doubts whether Lex would like working under Alfred as the real head of the corporation . " " I have loads of money . " " But Alfred wo n't take any of it . It 's too risky . And people are n't risking their money these days . Alfred 's been to see a dozen men and they all have the same story . No money to invest . Then he suddenly bethought himself of Jack Tom Smith . " " Jack Tom Smith . What an awkward name . Why do those Southernershave to have double first names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man ! Jack Tom . It sounds like an old colored rag-picker . " " Picking up thousand-dollar bills , from what I understand , " said Mary . " Not all Southern ladies have double first names . My mother did n't , and she was a Virginian . " " I know that , Mary , and I did n't mean any offense or I would n't have said it . " " Perfectly all right , " said Mary , in a tone that was self-contradictory . " You must n't let things I say upset you , Mary . You have no idea what it is to sit here day after day with no one to talk to but a woman who would n't be here if she was n't paid well . You lose touch when you do n't see people . You lose the knack of talking to them . I do n't want to take advantage of being  --  an invalid . But you know all about me , Alfred 's told you . And you do n't know how grateful to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful to see that baby . It was wonderful to know about him , that he was on the way . And all the time you were carrying him , it gave me some excuse to go on living . I have n't had much excuse , you know . Nobody needs me . The girls go their own way , and thank God they have it in them to , because I have n't been much help . And Alfred did n't need me . He needed you , even before he ever knew you . I never thought Alfred would marry young , and I never thought I 'd see an Eaton grandchild . But now I have , and it 's wonderful to . A grandchild is n't your own , but you get something from having a grandchild that you do n't get from your own children . What is it , I wonder ? I know , but I ca n't put it into words . It 's  --  suddenlythere are three generations of you . You yourself , and your child , and his child . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into so much trouble if 1 'd known I was going to have a grandchild . Oh , I knew I was going to have grandchildren , everybody does if they live long enough . But I did n't know how I was going to feel . And now I ca n't say how I feel . I just go gab , gab , gab . But now I want to know what Rowland 's going to be like , and being his grandmother I can think about that without having the work and responsibilities of raisingp402him . That 's it . You 're so busy raising your children and so much a part of their lives that you do n't really give much thought to their future . . . I do n't want to embarrass you  --  " " You do n't embarrass me , " said Mary . " Wait till I tell you . I do n't want to even ask you to come to see me , because that must be  --  that takes an effort . But I hope , I sincerely hope , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to somebody , that you want to talk to somebody other than your mother , just remember me . There 's one good thing about my awful life , Mary . I 've had the experience . " " Why do you say that ? What experience ? " " Oh , Mary , we know . Do I have to say it in so many words ? I knew the first day you looked at me , Alfred had told you about me . Alfred is so honorable that he 'd feel he had to tell you that his mother had been an unfaithful wife . Well , I was . Of course I was . " " I know . I 'm not pretending I did n't know that part of it . But why are you saying all this now ? " " For the future . If I 'd had anyone to talk to  --  well , things probably would have turned out the same way . But maybe , just maybe having someone to talk to would have  --  no , maybe not . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from my second . I was thinking that the second one could have been prevented . But I guess not . No , I do n't think so . " " Is what you mean that I might want to have a love affair ? That 's simply never going to happen . And I must say , Mrs. Eaton , I ca n't say I like your thinking it might happen . " " It 's because I do n't want it to happen , " said Martha . " No , I do n't believe you . You think it is going to happen . I do n't say you want it to happen , but you 're convinced it will . In fact , listening to you , I got the feeling that you thought it had happened or was happening now . " " No , Mary , I do n't think it has happened or is now . But when I married Alfred 's father I did n't even know it ever happened . And not many years later it happened to me . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because when it happened , Mary , the man was just as innocent , or ignorant , as I was . He had never been in love with anyone but his wife . It 's people like us , innocent , ignorant people , that it does happen to . A friendship , and he 's nice when you need someone , and before you know it you ca n't stand to be separated . And with married people it is n't like a boy and a girl who are n't married . With married people there 's only one ending . " " No there is n't . There are two endings . You put a stop to it , as I did . I did , too . " " Then you were lucky , and strong . " " Whether I was lucky or strong , I put a stop to it before it ended the way you think it has to . And I always will . And I expect Alfred to do the same thing . "  | " Then you 're both lucky , and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does he know about the danger ? " " Of course . We do n't see so many people . And it was n't Lex Porter , so do n't imagine things there . " " I 'm glad you put a stop to it , and grateful . Glad for you and grateful for Alfred . You 're right . I did think it was Lex Porter . " " Well , it was n't . " " Lex could be a heart-breaker . " " Not my heart . Lex only appeals to a certain ty  --  " Mary changed her speech : " I do n't think of Lex that way . " " He only appeals to a certain type of woman , " said Martha . She smiled . " I guess he does . And I guess I have nothing to worry about . " " I was n't classifying you with Lex 's girls , Mrs. Eaton . " " Why not ? " " Ca n't we talk about something else ? " " Yes . That 's the trouble with not seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me it 's an event in my life , and I forget that they 're seeing people and making polite conversation all the time . I have n't people any more . I have servants , and whatever birds and animals I can look out at . Some women like to read , but I doze off . I 'd like to meet Mr. Galsworthy , John Galsworthy , the English author . He would have been on my side . And I read a book by a woman , Edith Wharton . But most writers have a tendency to gloss over things . Oh , well , most people do , too . I think about the lives of the people I 've known , some of them pretty interesting , but nobody 'd ever put them in a book , because everybody has that tendency to gloss over things . Nobody 'd ever put George Fry 's life into a book . Just a coach-man , finally burned to death in a fire . And yet it was an unusual life , if you knew the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My Miss Trimingham would rather read what she 's reading I now . The Sheik . Have you read The Sheik , Mary ? " " Yes . " " Did you like it ? I have n't read it . I would n't even know about it if Miss Trimingham had n't tucked it behind a pillow out of my sight . Was it naughty ? " " Well , parts of it , I guess . It never really tells anything in so many words . I guess they would n't be allowed to sell it if they did . But it never could have happened , at least I did n't believe it . It was written by a woman . The author is really a woman . Uses initials instead of her first name . " " Ethel M. Dell . " " No , it 's almost that , a name very much like that . Hull . E. Something Hull . " " Hull , yes . That 's it . " " A woman would never write about sex . Everybody 'd think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not supposed to know about it , even in 1921. "  | " I know . Since I 've been married to Alfred he 's told me some things , but I heard them when I was fifteen . We talked about it , but outwardly we pretended we did n't know about it . " " The men make us do that . They all want to marry a virgin , and then when they get the virgin they turn right around and want her to be Cleopatra . " " Cleopatra ? Why do you say Cleopatra ? " " Oh , because I always think of her as very naughty . My father used to have a picture of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra in his den . It was considered very risque , especially for my father , but it was n't really . She did n't have anything on above the waist , but everybody had statues that showed a lot more . Women , of course . Not men . If the statue showed a man , he always had something on . Leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a strange conversation to have with your husband 's mother . " " Not any more . Not since you 've been giving your baby a bath . My thoughts about Alfred go back to when I used to give him his bath . " " I do n't think I understand that . " " Do n't you ? I guess I did n't make it clear . I often have thoughts that I 'd have difficulty expressing . Out of practice . All I meant was , Alfred to me is more baby than man . If you and I talked about naked men , we 'd think of them as men , even if we were talking about my son and your husband . But now that you have a baby of your own , you can see how I could only think of my son as a baby , naked , not as a man . I 've never known Alfred naked as a man . And you have . Do I shock you ? " " Maybe you might if I understood you better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as well , " said Martha . " Tell me about your mother and father . Have they been in Wilmington all summer ? The heat must be even worse there than it has been here . " " Mother 's been away twice for a week at a time , but my father 's been there most of the time . He likes to take his vacation in September , in Canada . He and some other men have a place where they go fishing and gunning . " " They 're very kind . They call me up on the telephone every once in a while . I 'd like to have them here , but I know if I asked them they 'd feel they had to come , and when they got here there would n't be anything for them to do . I could n't entertain for them . The only time I 've had people my age in the house was when my husband died . And you were really the hostess then . What a burden for a brand-new bride ! I often think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't hard . The people were all so nice , so considerate . " " Do you know who sing your praises ? Nellie and Josephine . After that ordeal they said , Never worry about Mr. Alfred . He has a real lady and a real woman . ' I do n't do their brogue very well , but that 's what they said . " " I 'm devoted to them . "  | " Well , they 've been staunch and true to this family . I wish the girls were here . " " I meant to ask you about them . How are they ? " " Well , I get a long letter from one of them every week . They 've been on pack trips , and of course they 've had to learn to ride western style and Constance says she 's come to prefer it . Not Sally , though . She still prefers the English saddle . They 've met a lot of new people . They 've visited another ranch that 's owned by an Englishman , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to read if you 've never been out there . 1 ' 11 give them to you to read on the way home , but will you return them , because I 'm saving them ? " " I 'd love to read them , and I 'll send them back tomorrow morning . Give them my love when you write to them . " " Oh , and it 's so nice to have something to write about , this visit from you and Rowland . Ca n't you imagine the clucking and cooing that 's going on down in the kitchen right now ? " " Yes , I can . " " Now you must take care of yourself , Mary . Do n't overdo . I 've given birth to four children and I know from experience that it is n't only having the baby that 's exhausting . It 's afterwards that you have to be careful and not overtax your strength . Men never realize that . " " Alfred does . The doctor told him . " " I 'd love to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tries not to be a typical father , and the more he tries the more he 's like the one in the funny papers . " " Yes , " said Martha . " His father was like that with Billy . . . Mary , I know you want to go now , and much as I 'd love to have you stay , I do n't want to keep you . It was a great kindness , sweet of you to come all that way when you have n't been feeling well . Come often if you can , but as often as you like . Say goodbye to me now and would you send the baby up for just one more look ? " " Of course . " Mary rose and put out her hand , then changed her mind and bent down and kissed Martha 's cheek . " I will never do anything to hurt you , Mary . " " Of course you wo n't . " " Please remember that , because sometimes I say things that come out differently than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip on Mary 's hand and the girl smiled and left . In a few minutes Miss Macdougall , accompanied by Trimingham , brought the baby to the room . Martha was sitting in her chair and did not turn when they entered . " Here 's the wee one to say goodbye , " said Miss Macdougall . She held the child in front of Martha and Martha looked at him and nodded . " Thank you , " she said . The nurses looked at each other and Trimingham by a quick motion of her head signaled the other to leave . At the sound of the Hudson starter Martha stood at her window and waved , but Mary and her babyp406and the nurse were already in the car and did not see her . Martha returned to her chair and picked up a fan . " This was hand-painted , " she said . " When I was little I had one that folded . It came from Japan , and it was made of ivory . I think this one came from China . The Japanese ones are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm day . " " You get more air with that kind , " said Trimingham . Martha tapped the fan with her fingers . " It has almost the same sound as a drum , has n't it ? " " Yes . " " Mr. Barlow 's coming tomorrow or the next day . " " So I believe . " " What time is it ? " Trimingham looked at her Army wrist-watch . " Ten till three . " " Is that all ? We still have most of the afternoon left . " " Yes , it seems later than that . " " If I look at that sprinkler too long it makes me dizzy . " " It has that effect on me sometimes . " " Your watch must be slow , there goes three o'clock . " " I know . This watch , you see it is n't only a wrist-watch . You can take it out of this leather thing and use it for a pocket watch , but then it runs fast . I guess it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strap . " " How much does a real wrist-watch cost ? " " Well , I saw one for twe'rve-fifty , in the window . And they go on up to as high as fifty , in this kind of a watch . " " Pick one out for twelve-fifty and charge it to me . " " You mean as a present ? " " Well , I was n't going to take it out of your pay . " " Well , thank you . Thank you very kindly . Then I can give this one to my nephew . Such a fine lad . " " Today let 's not talk about your nephew . " " I do go on about him , I know . But he 's all I have . At least the only one I have any use for . The others just use me , to borrow money and never pay it back . " " They almost called him St. John Eaton . I 'm , ) lad they did n't . It might have been all right when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . " " Much better . " " I never really liked the name Alfred . Raymond was good enough for his grandfather . I should have insisted , no matter what Sam said . The finest man in Port Johnson . " " That 's what I 've always heard . They still speak very highly of him . " " We 're not talking about the same person . " " Your father . " " No . My husband . "  | " Oh , I thought you were talking about your father . Well , Mr. Eaton was a fine man . " " Oh , dry up , Trimingham . " " Have a care , now . By rights you ought to be taking your afternoon nap . I only let you stay up because you were good today , but now you 're getting just as bad as ever . " Martha stood up and looked at Trimingham , and began to laugh . " You 're lucky . " " Am I ? " " Yes . Just think if I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . " " You 're bad enough as it is , " said Trimingham . " I know . Poor woman . Poor Trimingham . I never have a kind word for you , do I ? " " I do n't expect it . I have my duties and that 's what I 'm paid for . " Alfred came to Port Johnson as quickly as he could , but that was four days later . He went to the mill from the station , taken there by Ed Barlow , who would not have been able to comprehend the confusion created by the pleasant news that Jack Tom was willing to advance the money necessary to buy out the Thorntons and Lex , and , on the other hand , the bad news of the fire , which so far Alfred could regard only as bad news . It was disturbing to have the great good news followed so closely by the bad . The good news was so good and so great that he had not had time to digest it , to revel in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , too , should have been thought over , appraised , regretted , until it had run its course . He had gained something and lost something within a twenty-four-hour period , and the one followed the other too quickly . He was therefore uncommunicative on the ride out to the mill . Ed stopped his car at the south end of the property , to show the damage at a distance . " I ca n't believe it , " said Alfred . " It reminds me of someone who 's had his front teeth knocked out . No more Bridge Shop . " " No more Bridge Shop , template shop , oil shanty , yard-crew shack , watchmen 's hut , loading platforms in the lower yards , the trapper . " " Where was the dinkey ? I hope that was saved . " " Which dinkey ? We had three . Well , we still have all three . They 're boarded up and white-leaded in the engine-house up at the north end . " " We had three ? I guess you must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number 2 , I used to love to ride on that when I was a kid . " " I remember . We could always tell when you were taking a ride , ringingthe bell and blowing the whistle . " " Francis Xavier O'Day was the engineer . Always gave me a piece of cake from his lunch-pail . I used to consider it a privilege to be allowed to throw the switches . " " Frank O'Day never minded that , I 'm sure . "  | " And the big whistle did n't blow the night of the fire . " " No . We had the steam . The insurance company makes us keep up enough steam in a small auxiliary to give us pressure for the fire hydrants . But I gave orders to disconnect the whistle when we closed down . " " Then there 's no fire whistle in Port Johnson at all ? " " None . They might as well get used to it now . They 're going to have to sometime , Alfred . The first good offer we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish we did n't have to . I would n't have said that two weeks ago , but seeing the hole in the scenery , where the Bridge Shop used to be , I get sentimental . " " I 'm having some pictures taken of all that 's left . You 'll want to show your grandchildren . We do n't have a picture of the Bridge Shop . Only the main office . " " I 'm just beginning to realize , Eaton 's Iron &; Steel is a thing of the past . " " A thing of the past . To be cold-blooded about it , financially we might have been better off if the whole shooting-match burned down . " " Well , let 's go have a closer look . " Most of the men in the clean-up crews recognized Alfred and nodded to him , but with neither affection nor hostility . " They 're glad to get the work , " said Barlow . " We hired them back on seniority and those with families . They 're all either ten-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That seemed the only fair way . It did n't satisfy everybody , but it was the best we could do . They all get the same money , thirty cents an hour . I put them on a six-hour shift to spread the work around a little bit , but some of them put up a howl . Some that were hired wanted to work ten hours and hog it all . Take it or leave it , ' I told them . There 're plenty of men will work four hours just to make a little cash . ' " " And here 's the old template shop . Not a wall standing . Where did they find George Fry ? " " About here . The way I pieced it together , George must have been using the lower shelf of one of those big workbenches for a place to sleep . It was like a Pullman sleeper , only not as comfortable . " " I just spent three nights in them , they 're not so comfortable . But more comfortable than a workbench . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said George was a Catholic . I never knew that . They had a service for him . He had a nice funeral , a pretty good turn-out . The two women that work for your mother , and I went representingthe mill . Some of the men that hang around the livery stable . The mill paid for it . It 'll come to under two hundred dollars . " " A man was burned to death right there . " Alfred shook his head . " But I do n't feel anything . I thought I would . I did on the train , but I do n't now . George was my best friend . " " You get used to the experience the older you get . I buried all butp409two of my classmates from High . Only three of us left out of eleven in our class , and one of them 's ready to go any day now . Not counting your father , I 've been a pallbearer five times in the last year and a half . Counting your father  --  six . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call that a pallbearer . And being on the degree team I go to all lodge funerals . " They spent an hour at the scene of the fire and another hour in the office until Walter came to take Alfred to the farm . He had supper with his mother and she retired for the night immediately . They exchangedbits of information and it was not until he went downstairs to read the evening paper that he realized that he had enjoyed every minute of their conversation . She listened , she did not interrupt , she did not convey that impression that she was laughing at him from the superiority of her disordered mind , and when it was time for her to go to bed she put up her cheek to be kissed as of old . But not as of old , not at all as of old . She could easily have been Elsie Ferguson , playing a charming invalid , and he a young admirer worshipping from afar . He had been afraid of this meeting , with its potentialities for emotional outbursts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she paid routine compliments to Mary and the baby and let it go at that . She was not his mother of old ; she was , for this meeting at least , normal , settled , and strong . Perhaps , he told himself , she was often like this . But he knew that she was not . This was new , and she was new . He saw her in the morning , before leaving for Wilmington . " I hope you 'll come again , very soon , " she said . " And I 'd love to sec Mary and the baby , but I suppose there 's not much chance of that before Christmas . If you go to Wilmington for Christmas , try to get up for a day . " And then he had left , knowing this woman less well than he had ever known her before ; less well than he had ever known anyone . He often says that this was the time that he could have made a decision that would have altered the course of his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go back to Pennsylvania , stay there , raise a family there . He had spent most of his life in Pennsylvaniaand it was the only place he really knew . He had roots there . When his son was born he realized for the first time that roots meant something to him . He began to take secret pride in the accomplishments of his family . He had always been proud of his grandfather , but now he also began to feel some pride in his father . He could not love his father . That would have been asking the impossible . But when he saw what had happened to the mill he says he felt the way most people were supposed to feel over the destruction at Louvain . The destructionp410at the mill seemed to him like a desecration of a man 's life work , and he was almost tempted to change his mind and give up the aviation business and take charge of the mill . He knew next to nothing about how the mill should be run , but he could count on Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot until business conditions improved and the mill went back into production again . He was also encouraged bythe improvement in his mother 's health . He did not count on it to last , but at least he had seen her take hold of herself instead of letting go when she had a legitimate opportunity . If she could do that unassisted , there was no telling how much more she might improve if he brought Mary and the baby to live somewhere in Port Johnson  --  not at the farm , but somewhere in that direction . He says that when he went back to New York , armed with Jack Tom Smith 's promise of financial support , he felt that his battle had been won . He could go to the Thorntons and offer to buy them out , and they would not have any very good reasons to refuse . If they agreed , he could then lay down the law to Lex andVon Elm and if they opposed him , he could get out . He had no intention of continuing the corporation without Lex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on with him or without him . Jack Tom Smith 's promise of money gave him the opportunity to have a showdownwith the Thorntons and Lex . If they resisted his efforts to run the company properly , he could resign with dignity , having offered to buy out the company . It was not like it had been the first time . The first time he quit it was more in a fit of pique and not very dignified . He was getting out of something that he had not put anything into . In fact , it was even worse than that . He appeared to be ungrateful and dictatorial . But now he had the money behind him and he was on equal terms with the Thorntons and Lex . That was what made him feel that the battle was won , no matter how they reacted or how it turned out . He sometimes says that although he was only twenty-four at the time , he had gone through almost everything a man experiences in his lifetimeand that everything else that happened later was repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four was the perspective that you get from more years of experience , but he had to be reminded that it was not true that everything that happened after that was repetition . He would often reply by saying that basically the situations were the same and therefore repetitions , but then he would be told that the results were not always the same and also they involved different people and therefore the experiences were totally different since no two people are ever the same . Sometimes he would agree to that , but sometimes he would argue . Looking back he would often take pride in the extent of his maturityat twenty-four . Not many young men had had as many important experiences as he had had , he would say , and he admitted that it gave him a sense of superiority to be able to say that . What were they ? And his answers were almost always the same , namely , that he had been in love twice before he was twenty and both times the girls had beenp413killed , which was an experience many men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war and in some danger , although not much , and he had had responsibility in the Navy at an age when he should have been going to proms . And he had had a lot of business experience in a year and a half . But he would be told that the one thing that gave him his sense of superiority more than anything else was his experiences with women . He was inclined to dismiss that experience , but it was true . He would change the subject , but the next thing he would talk about was having had a son at twenty-four . He says that he was young to be a father , although he was not the first in his class at Princeton to be a father . He was only comparing his experience with other rich boys and not with boys of the middle class and the poor ; there were thousands of boys whose parents were not rich , who had had every experience he had had at twenty-four . But he said , " Well , they never played court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's experience , too , do n't forget . " Well , he had never starved . To this he would say , " And damn few people you ever heard of starved either . " He says he is not sure just what decided him against going back to live in Port Johnson but there were several reasons . The real reason was that he was not a second-rater . He could have been the leading citizen of Port Johnson without much competition , but it would have been avoiding life and rather cowardly . Port Johnson was not good enough for him . He had to live in the big world , compete with the big people . He practically said that himself . He said he did not take pride in beatingHarry Van Peitz at tennis . He wanted to beat the first man on the Princeton varsity . It was the same with other things he wanted to do . All through his life he has been one of those men who gravitate toward the top by instinct , and I suppose that is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complimentary to a woman to know that she is loved by a man who has a touch of greatness . The house at Jagger 's Cove was too big for the young Eaton family and their staff of two , and the $150 monthly rent was more than Alfred wanted to pay , but it had its advantages and the primary one was that Mary wanted to live there . It was a two-story structure , a center unit to which an east and a west wing had been added , with a porch facing north that ran the length of the north elevation for the view of the Sound . The halls and rooms were high-ceilinged and there was a widow 's walk . The house belonged to friends and contemporaries of Eugene St. John 's who were taking two of their remaining years for a leisurely trip around the world , and Alfred and Mary were in **27;0;TOOLONG . The owners provided the necessary two gardeners , one of whom lived in a cottage on the place , but the owners wanted a reliable , socially acceptable couple who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental carried with it one condition : that the Eatons must live there the year ' round . It was as cool a spot as there was on the North Shore during the months when coolness is not easily found on the North Shore , but the location and the airy , spacioushalls and rooms created a costly heating problem in cold weather , and Alfred , who had never had to pay a coal bill , learned why there were so many rich people back in Gibbsville , Pennsylvania . He learned to operate a furnace  --  although that was supposedly the head gardener 's duty  --  and he learned to refrain from remarking that the apparatus was big enough to run the Vaterland  --  now the Leviathan and now berthed at Hoboken . He learned that any such criticism of the place annoyed Mary , who had visited the house as a child and as a girl in her teens , and regarded any slighting comment as ingratitude . " If we 're ever offeredOtto Kahn 's place for $15 a month , do n't take it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a bargain . " But Jagger 's Cove was only six miles from the Nassau Aeronautical Corporation plant and not more than ten miles from most of their friends ' houses . They were less than a mile from the Long Island Rail Road station and the village of Jagger 's Cove , where the merchants astutely charged them summer prices all year ' round . " This is good training for when I make my first million , " said Alfred . " Every young married couple ought to start out like this . It gives the man the proper incentive . " " Your sarcasm is wasted on me , because that 's exactly what I be-lieve . " " But it is n't as though we had n't seen some big houses before . You grew up with du Ponts , and I 've been to the mansions of the rich . In fact , my grandfather 's house was once known as The Mansion . AlthoughGod knows it was nothing to compare with this . " " Well , just get to work and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence , and no sarcasm , in the way she said it , and he had lost his point to a compliment . But it was unusual for her to be unresentful during such conversations , and during her pregnancy he refrained from criticism of their bargain  --  her bargain  --  and in time he became reconciled to the expense . She protested when he bought a second-hand Indian motorcycle-and-sidecar . " You 're pretending we 're poor , and we 're not . You 're making people think I 'm extravagant and you know I 'm not . " " I know you 're not . But there 's hardly room in the garage for the Marmon . They have five cars up on blocks and they ) had to move thern closer together to make room for our car . Tight squeeze , too . I got the motorcycle because I want the guys at the plant to know I 'm economizing . Good example for them . And anyway , I 've always wanted a motor-cycle . " " That 's what it comes down to . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an economy , too , Mary . I get about seven miles to thegallon with the Marmon . I get almost ten times that with the Indian . " " Pow-wow-wow-wow , you and your Indian . " " You 'd like it if you 'd go for a ride in it . " " I 'd lose the baby , too . " " Oh . I 'm sorry . " Any mention of the baby , before or after its birth , instantly had such a magical effect on Alfred that she ceased to take pleasure in watching his response . It was like throwing a stick for a dog to retrieve ; the response was so predictable , he would chase the stick when none had been thrown , and the performance became tiresome . It was , finally , the healthful aspects of the place for mother and child that made the Jagger 's Cove house acceptable to Alfred . After the baby was born Mary 's own pleasure in the child had been detracted from by the enormity of Alfred 's love for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completeness of it made her feel that she was being overlooked , by-passed , unappreciated , ignored , in spite of his gentleness and solicitude and tenderness . His concern for her during her postpartum hemorrhaging was genuine and unqualified , and made more touching to her by his helplessness while wanting to help . But she saw in his love for the baby an emotion that she could not share because Alfred could not share it , a love that was more nearly intellectual than  --  in spite of its depth  --  passionate . It was a love that by the nature of the man who held it and the child who was the object of it could never reach a climax . Passion and the practices of passion had been exquisitely pleasurable to her , as to Alfred , but from the most ecstatic love-making a man turned to sleep , and this love , she knew , was not subject to the vicissitudes of the expression of love . It was an even and an eternal thing , inexhaustible and indestructible beyondself-destruction , invulnerable to lethal attack by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the object of it . It was not that Mary did not understand this love ; she understood it only too well . And in her depressions she could not help wanting what was impossible to have , what her husband could not even give . It was no comfort to contemplate what she had , that was freely given . There was no reason-ablenessin wanting what she wanted , thus no hope that she could be satisfied without it . And so , as though to pay for a successful birth of her first child , she was left to think the thoughts that even in their minutest form had the power to eat away at the love that existed between Alfred and her . Concurrently , her own love for her child was not affected by Alfred 's love for it . It was deep and true and passionate , and good-humored , and besides all the other things , the baby was fun . She was not aware of any destructive force within herself , and she had confidence in her physical recovery , and she therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to take pleasure in the exercise of her newly developed power to observe the minutiae that indicated its progress in life .  |p414She  saw things that no one else saw ; a single new eyelash , the disappearanceof a wrinkle , the enlarging of a nostril . Out of her womb the baby was more truly the whole of her life than he had been as an insistent heavy presence inside her . She bore no resentment toward the baby for his father 's love of him ; it was the love itself she resented . And a woman could not complain of her husband 's love for their child when it had done nothing to lessen his love of her . There was no reasonableness in wanting what she wanted , thus no hope that she could be satisfied withoutit . They had curtailed their social activities after the early months of Mary 's pregnancy . A woman 's pregnancy was not discussed in her presence if it was mixed company  --  and the company was seldom mixed . It was , in fact , an indicator of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male friend to dinner and bridge with his pregnant wife , but even then the subject was embarrassing , although the wife might be great with child . The whole process of love-making and reproductionwas so new and fascinating to Mary that she escaped most of the gestative boredom , and visits from her mother , visits to Wilmington , and the running of the household occupied much of her waking hours . And while the baby remained in her womb she was maternally protective toward Alfred , who was dissatisfied with the state of affairs at the plant . He told her everything , day to day , and she became interestedthrough the accumulation and possession of his information , rather than through an original interest . Alfred confided in her , and in no one else , that the armistice between him on one side and Lex and Von Elm on the other was ended in three months , at which point Lex and Von Elm on their own ordered two Wright engines . Alfred 's first knowledge of the order was the presence of the crated engines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Lex was not in the draughtingroomoffice he shared with Von Elm , and Alfred ignored Von Elm . About an hour later Lex appeared in Alfred 's office . " You were looking for me . I guess I know why , " said Lex . " Well , I saw those crates and I knew they were n't perambulators . " " That 's just the trouble , Alfred . Perambulators are more on yourmind than aeroplanes these days . " " There 's room in my mind for both . What are they going to cost ? " " A thousand dollars apiece . The Navy 's ordered a hundred of them from Wright and we heard about it , so we got these two . We could never have got them for that price if the Navy had n't given Wright the big order . " " We 're in the business , so we 're going to need engines . I do n't object to spending the money for essentials , and engines are essentials . But I do n't like you going over my head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I did n't like doing it , but I did n't want to have an argument over it , so I went ahead . I never know how you 're going to take it when we want to spend some money . " " Try me , " said Alfred . " I 'm not objecting now . "  | " No , but just before we ordered the engines you 'd just given us hell for ordering a hundred gallons of dope . " " Fifty gallons was more than enough . It did n't take anywhere near fifty gallons to paint those wings and fuselage , so why tie up cash ? I 've saved enough money around here to pay for those engines . Do you realize that ? But if you and The Genius had your way , we 'd have a stockroom filled up with stuff we 're not going to need for at least two years , if ever . And all representing cash tied up . The only way I can make you understand what I 'm doing is to hammer away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there , because you can see those engines and you know how much they cost . Let me give you an examination . I 'll get out some data for you . Here it is . Take the machine shop . How much does a lathe cost ? " " Search me . " " Seven hundred dollars . A shaper , how much ? " " I do n't know . " " Six-fifty . The air compressor system ? A thousand . We have a lathe , a miller , a shaper , a power hack saw , two drill presses , a grinder , a forge , the air compressor system , the line shaft and pulleys , the vises and small tools and chucks , and two chain hoists . It adds up to eight thousand fifty dollars in the machine shop . Take this office , this room and the outer office . It does n't look like J. P. Morgan &; Company , but we spent twenty-four hundred on furniture and equipment . " " I know things cost money . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know that they would have cost more if I had n't paid cash in some cases , and in other cases bought second-hand . If I let you and The Genius have a free hand you 'd order from catalogs , everything new . Your uncle wanted everything new , too , but he did n't know the difference when I bought some things second-hand . There are some items in here that are better second-hand . A workman ca n't complain that a machine has n't been broken in . Do you know what our annual payroll is ? " " No . " " Over $50,000 . That 's a figure you can understand . And believe me , I can too , because it 's something I ca n't fool around with . But just remember , Lex , we got those engines for nothing because I do the shitty job . " Lex rarely apologized to anyone for anything , but the conversation temporarily had the effect of censure , and it pleased Alfred that it had been accomplished with facts and figures and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been permanently damaged in the first dispute between Alfred and Lex , and communication between Alfredand Von Elm existed almost entirely through Lex . There was little occasion for more direct contact , since Von Elm worked with and under Lex . Alfred and Von Elm hated each other soundly and comfortably , once they had passed beyond the stage of compulsory , tentative polite/ness . Alfred 's motorcycle irritated Von Elm because it was rather dashingand at the same time an economy that Von Elm  --  loving money that was his own  --  could not carry off . Von Elm had bought himself a Brooks-type suit at Nat Luxenberg 's , but he still wore the pointed high shoes and the fedora hat with the bow at the back . The hostility between Alfred and Von Elm disposed of any social relations after working hours , but Lex had been a disappointment to Von Elm on that score . Once , and only once , Lex invited Von Elm to his uncle 's for a swim , and when Von Elm replied that he could not swim , Lex made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rich and elegant . Von Elm lived in a boarding-house in Huntington and drove to work in his Dodge roadster . He was hardly a half hour 's drive from the power and the glory of the North Shore , but he was still as far away from it as Greensburg had been from Sewickley . On Sunday afternoons he would drive slowly along the narrow , winding roads of Nassau County , seeing nothing of the great estates except the protective shrubbery and French fences and the mighty names on the little black or green signs . The simplicity of the signs amused him  --  all but the sign at Jagger 's Cove reading A. Eaton . It would be a pleasure some day to kick that one over . Since Mary had neither curiosity nor social ambitions to disturb her , her residence on Long Island was not attended by the nervousness of the newcomer . There was not much difference between taking up residence there on a permanent basis and the frequent visits in the past , and what difference there was was favorable to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jagger 's Cove . The only disturbance during the months of her pregnancy was the reappearance of Jim Roper , now a full-fledged medical student at Columbia . Alfred and Mary saw him at a wedding and she invited him for Sunday lunch . " I had to do something , " she said , on the way home . " He knows I know he 's going to be here tomorrow . He knows I 've invited the Broomes , and he 's staying with them . I could n't say , We 're having your host and hostess tomorrow , but do n't you come . ' " " I 'm not blaming you . You had to invite him . He did n't have to ac-cept . " " Well , he 's the only ghost in my past , and heaven knows he is n't much of a one . Although I declare he looks like one . " The Broomes already knew the Jagger 's Cove place , but Jim Roper did not , and he accepted immediately Mary 's casual offer to show him around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred asked Mary what she and Roper had talked about . " He did n't have his , wuddiacall-it , stethoscope with him , so I guess he was n't clinical . " " He still loves me . " " Why are you so frank about it ? " " Because , honey , I give you credit for knowing he did . You would n't have believed me if I 'd said we talked about the landscaping . "  | " No , I would n't , not after seeing the cow-eyed looks he was giving you today , and yesterday . Are you planning to elope with him ? " " He did n't go that far , but he allowed as how if you ever whupped me or did n't treat me kindly , he 'd always be there , ready and waiting , open arms . " " You 're making a joke of it , but he did n't mean it as a joke and you did n't take it as one . Did you let him kiss you ? Did he try ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talked about ? " " I told him he ought to get out and play tennis or something . He said he played a little , they have courts where he is , but he did n't play often enough to get a real tan . " " Very solicitous of you . I suppose you told him he was n't getting enough to eat  --  " " I could n't after the lunch he ate . " "  --  that 's what I was going to say . Herr Doktor Roper had all kinds of an appetite today . I suppose he has n't got a girl to make him forget you . " " I asked him that . He has n't . " " You really went into it , did n't you ? " " Well , why should n't I ? We were engaged , do n't forget , and he 's never done anything to you . I like him , and I always will like him . You ca n't expect me to stop liking all my men friends , any more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them I knew years before I ever met you . So let 's not talk about it any more . " All she said was true , and it was not the truth . She was not reporting the bitterness and intensity in Jim Roper 's words , nor the moment in their stroll when he stepped several paces away from her and said : " I ca n't even bear to touch your hand , you carrying his baby . You never gave me the chance to show you that I 'm a man . Now when I stay with a girl I pretend it 's you . I 've had a dozen girls since you gave me the gate , but they 've all been you , Mary . And that 's the way it 'll be . Some night in bed he 'll turn into me . " " That 's horrid ! That 's a filthy horrid thing to say ! " " Only half of what I 've been wanting to say for two years . Does your doctor say you can still go to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If I think of you it 'll be with loathing , now or ever . " " That 'll be even better . Maybe you 'll get to loathe him and that 's what I want . You made a fool of me , Mary . Did you think I was going to be the little gentleman about it ? I 've taken enough from all you bastards that had everything . I went to a good school because my father was a clergyman and they gave him a special rate . I had to wait on table in college and miss half the fun because I had to keep up my marks for my scholarship . And I 'll owe money for five years after I get my degree . But it would have been worth it if I could have had you . But no , a rich bastard with a big car came along , and I got the gate . " " I did n't know you had to work in college . "  | " I was ashamed to tell you . You knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to admit I waited on tables , serving meals to some of the bastards that you know . " " They 've never mentioned it . " " Oh , no . Of course not . Would n't think of embarrassing good old Jim . " " Still , it was nice of them not to mention it . " " Oh , the hell with them and how nice they are . But they took my girl . You were my girl . I had them all licked till Eaton came along . If you expect me to be the little gentleman about it , you 've got another think coming . " " Jim , do n't feel this way . I 'm sorry . But I found out that I loved Alfred and I did n't really love you . It was n't money . He is n't very rich , like Lex . " " He had a big grey Marmon and I could n't afford the carfare to Wilmington . He could be everywhere that I could n't be , and even your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against me . " " Nobody turned against you . " " All right , then I turned against them . He is n't rich ? Look at this place . You have to be rich to be a guest here . " " That 's practically what we are . " " Ha . Mirthless laughter , mirthless laughter . " " He 's a wonderful husband , and he works as hard as you do . " " And he 's the boss . President of a company at his age . Did he work his way up to that ? " " Let 's go back , and do n't come here any more , Jim . It does n't do you any good and it worries me . If you wanted to make me feel awful , you 've succeeded . And you could n't say these things to anybody you ever really loved , so I was n't your girl . " " You 're my girl even with his kid floating around inside you . " " At least try to be a gentleman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn at the start of their second year at Jagger 's Cove Mary and Alfred began to settle into the enjoyment of a marriage . There had ceased to be the frenetic concern over the ability to have a child and the having of the child . The child was there , he was healthy even in his illnesses , and he gave them joy . Alfred was learning and Mary was learning that to go to sleep without making love was not a cause to take offense . Without prejudice to their love they had begun to renew their interest in the world outside themselves and in so doing had taken on an individuality that was stronger and more assured than either had had before marriage . They were now a man and woman who were a husband and a wife , a wife with a husband , a husband with a wife , in the community of mankind , of the United States of America , of polite society , of Jagger 's Cove , Long Island . They had achieved nothing unusual , but they had achieved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had each forsaken the solitary incompleteness of the unmarried state . They had learned and would never stop learning thep419greatest joy of parenthood , which was the instinctive thinking of the child 's well-being before one 's own , and the joy of the consciousness of that thinking . Their own youth was only comparative ; they were infinitelyolder than the child but in his helplessness they retained the special privilege of communication through dependence , without languagebut in the one case by means of an angry or a happy trust , and in the other a devoted curiosity and a practical comprehension . On Saturday afternoons and Sundays they would play lawn tennis at one or another of the indoor courts of the very rich , or golf as guests at Piping Rock . Mary was so secure in her human motherhood that she asked for , and Alfred gave her , a collie bitch , six weeks old and young enough to grow up with the baby without jealousy . She called the puppy Prima because it was their first dog , and because a Donna was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were busy with small things , with their lives and their life together , with their popularity in society , with their deliberate prolongation of the practices of passion , with an unself-conscious contemplation of their tranquillity . The greater worries were , for those three seasons , subdued and postponed by the day-to-day routines of their happy life . The danger in Mary 's fear of Alfred 's love of the baby was unreal against the realness of the pleasure he gave her and took with her . And she was totally unaware of any danger that might be attributable to Jim Roper 's assault on her subconsciousmind . Her casual small lusts for other men were scarcely more than self-assuring responsiveness , provoked by her detecting similar covert lusts of her women friends for Alfred . She was no longer a defenseless virgin , unequal to the competition of other women . At a dance she would sometimes look about the room and know that she could not only match her beauty of face and figure with any other woman 's but could attract any desirable man by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her debutante days that some of the young women described her as " cold as marble , " and she knew that some of them had not bothered to change the description . But some of their menfolk had changed the description without , for sure , knowing why . " Whatever young Eaton is getting , " they would say among themselves , " I 'd like to have some of it , hot , cold , or luke-warm . " Among the women there was no doubt about Alfred Eaton . It was only a question of time , they said  --  and in their cynical judgment of a man whom they did not know very well they were not conscious of the harsh judgment they were passing upon themselves . The trouble was to come , they implied , with one of their own number , and not stopping at one . But until Alfred selected one and one selected Alfred , they were all as guilty as they were innocent ; all inadvertently comparing their set to a herd of mares awaiting their turn with the stud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of time ; the prediction was made so often that the identity of the speaker and present company changed over and over again and the speaker and present company be/came the absent and available ones . Tuesday 's good woman and virtuoussisters became part of Wednesday 's good woman 's potential adulteresses . And yet they were not especially and particularly cruel to Alfred . It was only that he was new . They had seen it happen before ; it was happeningnow , and as soon as Alfred had made their prediction come true , there would be someone else to take his place as the watched one . They were shrewd , and they needed no legal evidence as satisfactoryproof . The watched one always gave himself away and in so doing he only confirmed their suspicions about the woman ; the woman was always designated a little before the fact . She was suspected becausethe man had shown one extra courtesy , one extra effort to be in her company ; and her availability , the degree of her availability , was known to those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her stupidity , her nymphomania , her boredom , her curiosity , or her present admiration of or common interest with or even love for the man . The presence of love was a cause for worry among the sisterhood . Individually they would aid and abet an affair that did not go beyond clandestine meetings for the pleasures of the body . But an affair that began as or became love , and threatened two marriages , was not to be encouraged . No one thought of mentioning the " sanctity " of a marriage . The marriages had been sanctified at no higher altitude than St. John 's Lattingtown . But no one not immediately concerned wanted divorce . The serious pressure was always saved for arguments against divorcing , by the friends and contemporaries of the principal parties , then by the next older generation . And an adulterous man and woman who obstinatelydivorced their wife and husband and went on to a marriage of their own were held in low esteem . They had violated good order . Even in the least scandalous of such developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the attention of the outside world , and the high hedges and French fences that hid the big houses from the view of Lawrence Von Elm were only small evidences of the smaller world 's passion for privacy . But it must not be thought that good order was the vocation of the women . It originated with and was enforced by the men . The fathers and the grandfathers , the uncles and great-uncles were the hardest sophisticates in the world , and peculiarly American . They had had their money long enough  --  even when it was no more than a single generation  --  to discover that it would buy anything that the Englishmanhad , whether it was a servant or an elephant 's tusks or a thousand grouse or a soft-rolled lapel or a Shakespeare folio , and there was no title under duke that would tempt them to change citizenship , since all other titles were by their very nature restrictive , and these men resisted all restrictions they had not themselves made . They were sentimentallyattached to the English , often through lineage and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired Englishp421habits and tastes . But they regarded the Englishman 's system of recognitionand reward as undesirably immature and even slightly cheap . The title , the medal , the order , the sash , the velvet , the ermine , the buckle , the sword  --  they had all been copied and adopted by the undertakers and dentists and insurance agents and railway conductors who belonged to the more flamboyant Masonic sideshows . The reward for accomplishmentwas more power , and as the power increased so did the desire for and desirability of privacy . Underwood and no one else took their picture and it was expected to satisfy the public curiosity for at least ten years . Blythe and Marcosson were permitted to convey the public statements of these men , but other journalists and less thoroughly processed methods were given no consideration . Some of them were affable men , some kindly , a few humorous , and they were all subject to the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to , but they demanded obedience in all matters pertaining to their work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for privacy easily extended over matters not directly connected with their work . It was expected that the habit of obedience would be cultivated by all those who could not meet these men on precisely equal terms . At the moment there was no one living who alone and unaided could put these men in the secondary position . A gardener was more likely to take a firm , opposite stand than a United States senator or a Knight Commander of the Bath , but the gardener had earned that privilege . A man who allowed an illicit love to jeopardize his marriage and thereby to disturb good order forfeited what privileges he had and was likely to obtain . A similar punishment awaited the cuckolded husband who took his nasty discovery into the courts . He , too , had violated good order . One effect of this uncompromisingattitude toward divorce and scandal was that it ironically gave a sense of security to wives who contemplated or were indulging in extra-marital affairs . This effect was unknown to the keepers of good order , who were more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to the protection they enjoyed under the system of good order . A man on his way up suffered his wife 's infidelityrather than take public action that he knew would end his career . And the women knew it and made use of the knowledge . This unsuspectedimmoral effect of an apparently highly moral prohibition might have been truly laughable had the keepers of good order established their rules as a moral code . But in reality , and although some of the keepers of good order were religious and sternly moral men , the purpose of good order and its enforcement was to keep the public in ignorance of the personal lives of these men and their families . No publicity was better than any publicity , a rule which applied even in the matter of public benefactions . The library or the hospital or the museum might bear the donor 's name  --  or , more likely , his deceased mother 's name  --  but he remained as nearly anonymous as practical in the circumstances . A scandal attaching to a friend 's name was unthinkable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while secretly enjoyingp422security under the system , helped to maintain it for a less selfish reason . They knew that a man 's career could be ruined by divorce , and they protected their women friends as long as they were able . The women 's version of the code made for a practical loyalty that was at least as sound as a sentimental one , less subject to caprices of small envies and jealousies and not always dependent on close friendship . But if the system controlled the divorce rate , it also made a minor misdemeanor of infidelity . Neither Mary nor Alfred was a blood relation of the families which maintained good order , and their financial connection was so remote that it was unimportant . Mary 's father had gone as high in the du Pont company as he could hope to go , and the total fortune of the Eaton family would have been exhausted if it had had to cover the living expensesof any of a dozen North Shore families for a couple of years . But Mary had friends of long standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the current phrase , by Fritz Thornton , who , while not a business figure of the first rank , was a very rich man who was prominentin most of the right sports . As such he commanded more respect i than if he had devoted his time and money to high finance . In sport he was one of a few ; in Wall Street he would have been one of many . He worked as hard at his games and his clubs as other men worked to make money , with the result that in the matters on which he was expert , the men who had more money sought his advice . He was , moreover , safely conservative in his attitude toward outsiders , and his approval of Alfred Eaton was as good as a letter of unlimited social credit . If Fritz Thornton liked the boy , the boy must be first-rate . The boy who became the man had made a good marriage and was off to a good start in business by proving he wanted to work . He was good-looking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good swimmer , drank but had never been seen drunk , had some sort of a way with the women , and at the same time had a reserved something in his manner that signified good breeding and not merely a middleclassunfamiliarity with his new surroundings . He was said to be an extremely good influence on young Porter , and the older women consideredhim charming , charming . Bit by bit Alfred 's reputation was being assembled and his name had come up in houses he had not yet entered . He was new , but he had made a good impression , especially on families which had no sons . But the favorable impression needed the dramatic touch to have a lasting effect , and it was provided in February of the young Eatons ' second year on the North Shore . The MacHardie estate main entrance was just under a mile from Fritz Thornton 's and at any time but the dead of winter the lawns and the big house and the pond were hidden from view . But the hedges and other foliage were denuded except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow for two days and the roads were cleared for passage but only at low speed as Alfred and Mary made their way to Fritz Thornton 's tennis court . It was just before threep423o'clock and they were going to be slightly late for their tennis date , but the drifts and icy road forced Alfred to drive in second gear . " Look at that little boy , " said Mary . " His little ears are going to fall off . But he 's a good little skater . Alfred ! Stop the car ! He 's going through the ice ! Oh , God ! Alfred . " " Where ? Where ? " " The pond , the pond , the pond . On the left . " A woman in a heavy dark-blue cape was screaming , " Sandy ! Sandy ! " But she stood as though frozen at the edge of the pond . Alfred moved the car through the gateposts , got out and ran to the pond . It was plain to see where the child had gone through , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his overcoaton the snow and took off his jacket , waistcoat and shoes and walked slowly on the ice until it gave way and he went under . He found the child immediately and brought him up and still holding him in his arms , walked in the shallow pond until he was able to hand him to the nurse . " Alfred , you 're bleeding , " said Mary . " Never mind me , let 's start working on the kid . " " I know how , I know how , " said the nurse , now somewhat composed . She lay the boy on his belly and began lifting him in the rhythm of artificial respiration . " Will you help her , Mary ? I 'll go telephone for a doctor . " " I want to help you . Your neck , your throat is cut . Alfred , please ? " " I 'll be all right . You help her . " He got into the Marmon and drove to the main house . A butler , whom Alfred could see through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting on his tailcoat as he walked . He stared at Alfred , wet and bedraggled and bloody , and started to close the door in his face , but Alfred pushed his body against the door and spilled the butler . " Where 's your phone ? I have to have a doctor . Little boy fell in the pond . " " Little boy ? Sandy ? Master Sandy ? " " Yes , now get to the phone , you damned fool , and call the doctor . Better yet , call an ambulance , tell them to bring a pulmotor . " " You , sir ? What have you done to yourself ? " " Get to the God damned telephone , will you ? " Alfred opened his eyes some time later and saw Mary , a man identifiableby his stethoscope hanging about his neck , and another man in a Donegal tweed suit and wearing a wing collar , all standing near the bed . The green velvet window draperies had been drawn and Mary was in the tennis dress she had worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred . " How do you feel ? " " I feel all right , I guess . " " Take a sip of this , " said Mary , coming to the bed . " What is it ? " " Steer-o . Bouillon . "  | " Oh , " said Alfred . " Is the boy all right ? " " The boy is alive , thanks to you , sir . My name is MacHardie , James MacHardie . I 'm the boy 's grandfather . " " Is he all right ? " " He 'll be all right , " said the doctor . " Try not to move around , Mr. Eaton . I 've had to take twelve stitches in your neck . Apparently cut yourself on a jagged piece of ice bringing the little fellow out of the dam . A nasty cut , but it could have been much , much worse , an inch or two to the right . " " Did you call Lex ? Tell him we were n't coming ? " said Alfred . Mary laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm terribly sorry . " " Perfectly natural reaction , I 'd say , " said MacHardie . " Your wife has been very brave , Mr. Eaton , and  --  well , very brave . " " She always is . " Alfred took her hand . " I 'm sorry I did n't recognize you , Mr. MacHardie . I 'm in a fog , I guess . " " Think nothing of it , my dear sir . Your friends are downstairs . My friend Fritz Thornton , and his nephew , Lex Porter . " " I have a son of my own . Is your grandson all right ? " " He 's alive , and he 's asleep . Naturally we have to consider the possibility of pneumonia , am I not correct , Doctor Blane ? " " We have to , yes , Mr. MacHardie . " Alfred shivered uncontrollably . " Do I have to consider that possibility ? I ca n't bed down in Mr. MacHardie 's house . Is there any whiskey ? " " You can have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor . " You can have everything here you 'd have in the hospital , " saidPvlacHardie . " I do n't think we ought to move him , do you , DoctorBlane ? " " No , he 'll be better off here for a day or two . " " Would you like some more bouillon ? " said Mary . " I like  --  sleep , " said Alfred , and dozed off . Alfred remained at MacHardie 's house for three days . Mary was given a room connecting with his through a bathroom . They were driven to Jagger 's Cove in MacHardie 's Daimler , and in every room in the house there were dozens of hothouse roses . At the end of the week there was a large package from Tiffany 's . When they had removed the wrapping Mary said : " Heavens ! I 've seen this . I 've seen this , Alfred . I saw it when I went to exchange wedding presents . I know what it cost . " " Twelve stitches . " " Twelve stitches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tea service , is n't it ? " " Not a tea service . It belonged to some very famous person . Let 's see the card . " Alfred handed her the card , a calling card of Mr. James Duncan MacHardie , with the Mr. crossed out and written at the top : " Profoundly grateful . "  | " Five hundred dollars a stitch , " said Alfred . " It belonged to Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin . Mother would know . She remarked on it when we were in the store . " " I did all the work and you get all the hardware . " " You 're getting something , but I 'm not supposed to tell you . " " What ? Some cream and sugar to go with the set ? " " Never mind . And act surprised when we go there to dinner . " " I 'll act surprised when we get invited . " " We have been and I 've accepted . Next Friday . Alfred , you 're a wonder . I saved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was twelve years old and 1 got a five-pound box of Page &; Shaw 's . You saved James D. MacHardie 's grandson . " " I used to like those Page &; Shaw jordan almonds , all covered with white sugar stuff . " " Is your mind all right ? " " My mind 's all right , all right . I do n't mind his giving us a present , but I do n't like going there for dinner . I wish you had n't accepted . I wish you 'd told him  --  anything . " " He did n't invite us . His daughter did . She wants to thank you and you ca n't refuse her that . " " Oh , the old boy is n't going to be there ? " " I did n't say that , honey . But his daughter 's the hostess . " " I wish they 'd let it go at giving us a present . You ca n't stretch out undying gratitude through a whole evening , " said Alfred . He need not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coats were taken by a footman and maid , and they were led to the library , a cheerful room in spite of the massiveness of the furniture and the gold-and-leather formality of the sets of books . Logs were burning in the fireplace , there was a globe large enough for a general staff , silver paper cutters and framed photographs of Booth Tarkington and Mark Twain among other photographs of royalty , Republican government notables and family . There were also some framed handwritten letters which Alfred did not have a chance to read before MacHardie 's daughter briskly entered the room . " How nice of you to come , Mrs. Eaton , Mr. Eaton . I 'm Jean Duffy , Sandy 's very grateful mother . And this is my husband . " While speaking she pushed a wall button , a maid appeared in the doorway , and Mrs. Duffy nodded , all without interrupting her talk . " My husband and I wanted to thank you alone  --  " " And we do , " said Duffy . " And we do , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and as a very special treat for him , I think he 's on his way downstairs at this very moment . At least if my arrangements are working out . Yes . Here we are . Sandy dear , this is Mr. and Mrs. Eaton . Mrs. Eaton , this is our boy , and Mr. Eaton , you have met before . " The boy , in pajamas and bathrobe , took Mary 's hand and bowed over it , but when he shook hands with Alfred he stared up at him inp426adoration . He was about six years old , thin and with light brown hair . " I 'm glad to see you 're all dry , Sandy , " said Alfred . The boy laughed . " All dry , yes . That 's good . I 'm glad to see you 're all dry , too . " " Well ? " said the boy 's father . " Oh . Thank you very much for fishing me out of the pond , " said the boy . " And ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . And it 's a good thing I was n't any smaller oror  --  oryou would have had to throw me back . " " Very good . Very  --  good , " said his mother . " Very good , son , " said Duffy . " And now skedaddle . Kiss for Mother , kiss for me , and up up up up . " " But Daddy , we all forgot , " said the boy . " What did we forget ? " said Duffy . " Mr. Eating . I hope your neck is better , " said the boy . " Thank you , Sandy . It 's much better . I still have the bandage . Do you want to see it ? Well , I guess I ca n't open my shirt to show you , but it 's right here , and much better . " " You remembered and we forgot , " said Mrs. Duffy . " You have much better manners than your mother and father . But now off you go , and go right to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The boy again bowed to Mary and took Alfred 's hand . " Will you go for a swim with me in Grandpa 's pool sometime ? " " Almost any time you say , " said Alfred . " And I say , no more delays . Goodnight , darling , " said Mrs. Duffy . The boy departed . " Now I 'm sure you 're ready for your cocktail . You were very sweet to him , Mr. Eaton , and he 's been looking forward to this meeting as much as we have . " " And that 's saying a lot , " said Duffy . He was a portly man , forty years old , with thinning hair parted in the middle . He wore a white waistcoat with his dinner jacket and had the look of good food and Turkish baths , but also of powerful arms and shoulders and coldly appraising blue eyes . His teeth were white , even , and small for his face as it was now but probably not out of proportion before he had begun to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order in his satin lapel . Alfred judged him to be a good boxer and a punishing one . His wife , who was probably thirty-five , wore a black lace dress , firmly corseted underneath , and she had large full breasts that squeezed together almost to her throat . Her jewelry was a doubled strand of pearls , a ring of rubies and diamonds on her right hand , and a plain gold wedding ring and one-carat diamond in a Tiffany setting . Together the Duffys presented a picture of opulence with obvious inferences of frequent sexual contests , tending toward slappings and laughter . " Creighton , dear , you and Mrs. Eaton lead the way ? " James MacHardie and the other guests were waiting in another room ,  |p427all  white and gold even to the concert grand piano , which stood in the far corner with a concert harp , and white and gold music stands . All the smaller chairs were matching , all the larger chairs matched , and the two sofas were a pair . The room had a crystal chandelier and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was a glare , and the six persons seemed lost . The butler was serving Martini cocktails and sherry from a small glass mixer and a small silver-leafed decanter . " Mrs. Ripley , Lady Sevringham , Mrs. Pearson , Mr. Thornton , Lord Sevringham , and my father . Mr. and Mrs. Eaton . I think that does it . " " Mrs. Eaton , you come and sit beside me , wo n't you ? " " She has you at dinner , Father . No . " " Do n't be bossy , now , Jean . Mrs. Eaton and I dined together for three nights straight and we still had a lot to talk about , did n't we , Mrs. Eaton ? " " I had a very good time , speaking for myself . " " Sit down , now , and tell me , how is Master Rowland Eaton , and have you any news of our mutual friends in Wilmington ? " Alfred took a seat beside Lady Sevringham , a fiftyish woman who smiled at him until he was more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not going to speak . Then , abruptly , she did speak . " Mm . Tell me , Mr. Eaton , what do you think of the chain drive ? " " The chain drive ? The chain drive . " " Precisely . The chain drive . We 've been discussing it . I say it 's a nuisance , dangerous , inconvenient , ugly , and on the way out . " " I agree with you . " " You agree with me . Now you see , this young man agrees with me , and all young Americans are expert mechanicians . " " All but me , " said Alfred . " But I agree with you . " " Oh , now you must n't be over-modest . You do know cars , do n't you ? What do you drive ? " " A Marmon . " " A Marmon . Now let me see . Marmon . Yes , I know that one . Now it has n't a chain drive , has it ? " " No . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something else . Where is 0-re-gon ? " " Oregon ? It 's in the Northwest . " " On the Pacific Ocean , is n't it ? " " Yes . " " And therefore at least three thousand miles from the Long Island , would n't you say ? " " Easily . Closer to four thousand . " " Then will you please tell Sevringham , my husband , the gentleman who 's trying to talk to your pretty little wife but has an ear cocked to our conversation  --  will you please tell him that he simply can not take the sleeping-car and expect to be in Portland next morning ? "  | " Portland , Maine , he can , " said Alfred . " Portland , Maine ? The State of Maine ? I know Maine . It 's just below Canada . But there are two Portlands in the States ? " " More than that , I think . " " But why ? When you have a new country like this you have a splendid opportunity to start from scratch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there two Portlands ? " " Oh , we have some worse ones than that , Lady Sevringham . " " You have ? How worse ? " " Well , you 've heard of California ? " " Of course . I have a friend there . " " And you 've heard of Indiana ? " " Yes , I think so . Yes , yes . Indiana . India-napp-polis . " " And Pennsylvania ? " " Of course . Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania . I know a dozen people there . The Pennsylvania Railway takes you to Philadelphia . " " Right . Well , there 's a California in Pennsylvania , and an Indiana in Pennsylvania . " " A state within a state ? Two states within a state ? How could there be ? I 'm sure there 's a perfectly reasonable explanation , but spare me it , please . This is my first visit to the States and I 'd so looked forward to it , but you know , I 'm quite discouraged . You make it so difficult for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty , but it has a vitality . Philadelphia , with all those Welsh names , I was quite touched . My mother was born in Wales . But why do you , for instance , call a place the Polo Ground and they 've never had anything but baseball there ? " " I never saw an elephant in Piccadilly Circus . " " No , I daresay . You know London , then ? " " During the war . " " I do n't think I 'd have come to America if I 'd judged you on what I saw of you then . You must confess you were  --  shall we say  --  you got out of hand . " " Some of us did , I 'll admit . I know I did . " " But I 'd known one before the war , perfectly charming and later I admired him because he stayed right on through the air raids . Shared them with us , so to speak . I wonder if you 'd know him . Man called Budd . Devrow Budd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know him very well . " " You do ? Now did his wife shoot someone ? I never met his wife , but there was some story that she went back to the States and shot her lover . I 'm not scandalmongering . After all , you say you knew Devrow very well , you must have known that he was very fond of the ladies and made no bones about it . What did happen ? " " His daughter was murdered , then the man shot himself . " " His daughter it was . There was a daughter , I knew that . He was terribly fond of her , but quite concerned about her , and I gather not without reason . Devrow told me she was having a , well , surely not anp429affair , but a strong attachment for a boy much younger than she was . And so the boy shot her and then killed himself , did he ? " " No , he did not . That 's not the way it was at all . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We came from the same town . " " Oh . Were you related to them ? I 'm sorry if I 've hit on a tender spot . " " I was n't related to them . " " I 'm a fool , but not entirely a fool . You were the boy , were n't you ? I am sorry . I 'd do anything to take back everything I 've said , but I ca n't do that . " She put her hand on his arm . " Yes , I was the boy . " " Will you share a secret with me ? I was his mistress , " she said . " I offer you that secret as a token of my regret . I would never , never hurt anyone through his love . Do you forgive me ? " " Yes , I do . " " Dinner  --  is served , " intoned the butler . " Will you ring me up ? We 're stopping at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . I must talk to you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there 's nothing to talk about . " " I see , " said Lady Sevringham . The seating arrangement kept Alfred and Lady Sevringham together . James MacHardie sat at the head of the table , and Jean Duffy faced him at the opposite end . On MacHardic 's right were Mary Eaton , Lord Sevringham , Mrs. Ripley , and Fritz Thornton , in that order . Alfred sat on Jean Duffy 's right , and to the right of him were Lady Sevringham , Creighton Duffy , and Mrs. Pearson . Mrs. Ripley was  --  Alfred guessed  --  the widow of Standish W. Ripley , the former Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , and Mrs. Pearson was the wife of Ray Pearson , a friend of Fritz Thornton 's whose quick indentification was that he had been on Walter Camp 's All-America while at Harvard and was otherwise known to the North Shore as an insatiable satyr , who made no discrimination in regard to race , color , or social-economic status . At least in the minutes Mary and Alfred had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his whereabouts . The fact was that Frances Pearson was not likely to know and had long since ceased to care . Alfred had met her before in Fritz Thornton 's company , and was as convinced that they had had an affair as he was now that the affair was ended . They were served Cape Cods on the half shell , potage Mongole , filet mignon , Brussels sprouts , French peas bonne femme , chef 's salad , cherries Jubilee , and petits fours . There was a red wine with the meat and champagne with dessert . The dinner was served by two footmen , assisted in the clearing-away by two maids , while the butler stood behindand to the right of MacHardie . Jean Duffy addressed herself to Alfred through the oysters and soup and he talked without imparting any secrets but without letup until she dropped him for Fritz Thornton.  | " And now you 're back to me , " said Lady Sevringham , as the table was turned . " Yes , " said Alfred . " Afraid I was n't very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own fault . I was thinking of you and my own guilty conscience . I 'm much too direct , and I have n't yet learned that this is a small world . I 've never been anywhere , you know . We see always the same people , and they see us . That 's the size of it . I 've never been to India , or South Africa . I 've been to Italy and to France and nowhere else . My husband 's away a good deal and I like the country . When he 's home we go up to London to brush out the cobwebs , but I 'm always ready to leave London after three or four days . Although I confess I was quite taken by Monte Carlo . I discovered that I loved to gamble . For that reason I never went back . One never knows what secret weaknesses one has . Not secret . Undeveloped . Undiscovered . But why am I telling you all this ? I 'll tell you why , if you have n't guessed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone in common , therefore I felt free to prattle on as I did . All unawares , I was opening up an old wound of yours , and now I find that I 've opened up an old one of my own . " " I 'm sorry , " said Alfred . She paused . " Yes , I suppose you are . Sorry for me , of course ? " " Yes , that 's what I meant . " " Yes , I knew that . You 've known sorrow , and I think more than was brought about by Devrow 's daughter . Well , so have I. And that 's what I wanted to tell you when you came to see me . Since you do n't care to see me , and I ca n't say I blame you , I must take advantage of these few moments to correct your impression of me . I ca n't have you , if ever you think of me or hear my name , you must not think of me as a heartless , gossippy woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd let me talk to you about Devrow Budd . I was in love with him , and heaven help me , I 'm not sure but that I still am . To me it was the most mysterious experience of my life , but it happened . I 'd been married for ten years , eleven , twelve . Thoroughly domesticated and content , and when my husband brought this man to our house , I was my usual self . I gave the same nice party , with the same nice people , and that night  --  this is important  --  I was visited by my husband and we had a good thing . Our usual , Friday-night custom . Devrow Budd was not in my mind . The Saturday was  --  another Saturday . Shooting , or golf . Someone 's house for dinner . Then Sunday . Devrow was called back to London and I knew that my husband had something to do so I offered to drive Devrow to the train and did so , in my little car . I felt quite sure he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way to the station . We had something like ten minutes to wait for the train , and in those few minutes he stripped away all my complacency just as a few weeks later he stripped off my clothes . It 's getting late , you know , ' he said to me . I know . ' I said . Past five . " Past thirty-five , ' he said . How can you do it ? How can you go on living at the bottom of a well ? You'rep431almost blind now , and in a few years it 'll be too late . Did Sevringham sleep with you Friday night ? Yes . And he will next Friday night , and he did last Friday . Did he bother to look at you ? Did he find any new delights in you , or you in him ? Is that all you 're to get , and all you 're going to give ? ' I was astounded . Was this the way Americans behaved ? Until then he 'd been a gentleman , everything as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat , and I 'm on the telephone , ' he said . I promise you none of the noble things , but I 'll take you off the greengrocer'sshelf and at least make you feel like a great whore . ' " She took a deep breath . " Oh , when I think of how I felt at that moment . Degraded . Murderously angry . But I had no resources , my life had left me with none . Morally I had no muscles , no sinew . Nothing to fall back on such as a sense of humor . No experience to warn me that I was just possibly not the very first woman he 'd treated so . Well , he did make me feel like a great whore , but a great one , Mr. Eaton . He never made the slightest mention of marriage and divorce and a permanentstatus . For three years I went to his flat whenever we thought it was safe to do so , and not a soul the wiser . Then one day I had to change my plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that he was in love with me . When he told me that  --  I hope you can understand this  --  he became another husband . Is that too simple ? It 's the way it was . And I had to drop him . He became insistent , jealous , demanding , and insofar as scandal was concerned , dangerous . I told poor Sevringhamthat we could n't have Devrow any more , that he was drinking too much . " " And what did you tell Budd ? " " That I had another lover . It was the only thing he could under-stand . " " Did you ? I mean had you ? " " Not then . Later , briefly . But the other man meant less than nothing to me , only served to show me that I was in love with Devrow . Not really in love , longing for him , his childishness , ingenuousness I believe is the word . I have no excuses and no very good explanation . Sex , to be sure . But I need more than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . He only wanted his own way . He was a terribly simple , sweet man , and I do n't expect you to understand that for a second . Only another woman would understand that . Was his daughter like that ? " " I never knew it until this minute , but she was exactly like that . " " Then do n't be afraid to love her , Mr. Eaton . It ca n't harm that lovely creature you 're married to . We all have secret things . I said weaknesses , but they do n't have to be either weaknesses or strengths . You 're not a Roman Catholic , by any chance ? " " Lord , no . " " Well , I was until I ceased to be something on the green-grocer 's shelf . Sevringham is still , but very tolerant about my losing it . I was damned if I 'd confess to a priest that I had sinned . It seemed to mep432very ungrateful and hypocritical to Devrow Budd . I was  --  well , I sec I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you . " " Thank you ? What for ? Oh , the girl . You 're welcome . " Mary on her way out , stopped beside him . " What did you two talk about ? " " England . London . American ways and so forth . " " That 's exactly what we talked about , Lord Sevringham and I. She 's awfully attractive . " " She thinks you are , too . And you are , I 'll give you that . " " Gentlemen , I think the billiard-room for us , " said MacHardie . " Creighton , good fellow , would you lead the way ? " Fritz Thornton linked his arm with Alfred 's . " How 's the temperature at the plant ? " " The temperature ? Oh . Why , I 'd say it was above freezing , but not warm . " " Not warm . That 's too bad . Shall I continue to stay out of it ? " " I do n't want you to catch our cold . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third party was the germcarrierthere . " " Well , it is n't hopeless . " Thornton patted Alfred on the shoulder . " If it gets to be , let me know . " There was a large oaken tavern table at one end of the billiard-room and a dozen stout chairs around it . " That was a damned good dinner , Jim , " said Lord Sevringham . " And I could n't help noticing that Duffy and Jean and my good wife consumed every morsel of the filly . Devoured it like a crew of starving Protestants . Nor do I recall choking on it myself . Duffy , does he do this to you all the time , insidious Presbyterian trying to undermine our holy religion ? By God , Jim , I 'm going to have some Benedictine and let the good monks wash away my sin . Better have some , too , Duffy . I knew damn well it was Friday and I never hesitated . Pitched right in and ate every damned , sinful scrap of it . And to make matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scoundrel . Thornton , what do you say to that ? Is he a scoundrel ? " " Known to be , " said Thornton . " There you are , Mr. Eaton . Take warning . I gather you are n't very well acquainted with our host , but you see what we think of him that know him well . Thirty years , man and boy , I 've been observing his ways and never have I detected any sign of a change for the better . With those appropriate courtesies disposed of , I shall have one of those Havanas and in all likelihood doze off before I get the damned thing lit . Jim , your good health . " He raised his glass of Benedictine and took a sip . " Jerry , you 're incorrigible , " said MacHardie . He obviously liked and was accustomed to Sevringham 's fun , which was not obsequiousness in disguise but Sevringham 's own method of treating an importantp433American financier . MacHardie , a widower who seldom entertained younger people , was also grateful to Sevringham for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . He was a conscientious host rather than an adept one and he now turned to Fritz Thornton . " Fritz , what is this I hear about you ? " " Well , I do n't know , but for heaven 's sake , what kind of a question is that ? Everybody 's waiting for you to accuse me of almost any crime in the books . I am , too . " MacHardie smiled , pleased that his question had accidentally providedThornton with a humorous response . " Nothing criminal , although you do seem uneasy . No , I wanted to ask you to tell all of us here about your new boat . " " Oh , well that 's safe ground . But first , please do n't speak of it as my boat . It 's a syndicate , Jim . You know perfectly well that I could n't swing that alone . " " I do n't know that , but go on . " " Well , I 'm in it with five other fellows . It 's still only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ever gets . But even if that 's all that comes of it , we 've had some fun . We meet for dinner once a week and I let the others do the talking because they know more about it than I do , and then somehow it always turns into a game of poker . " " Oh-ho , well , have n't you managed to make your share out of the poker games ? " " Not quite . I 'll admit I could contribute a dinghy thus far and we 're playing  --  that is to say , meeting  --  again next Tuesday . But this is ' way in the future . Two years at least before we ever got a boat in the water . I was roped in on it , as I always am when someone has a splendid idea but needs some dilettantish idler to take the wheel . I know this much : when I die , if they put down all the committees I 've been on , from charities , to monuments to generals I never heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor old Thornton worked himself to death , and we 've always thought he was nothing but a lazy bum . ' Yes , Jerry , I know what bum means in England . They 'd call me that even if they knew what it meant . Already have , more than likely . My friend Alfred Eaton will bear me out , wo n't you , Alfred ? I told him many times when he was younger , get a job , any job , and you 'll have a good excuse . " " Fritz , you 'd be lost without your committees and the rest of it , " said MacHardie . " Of course I would . Now . Now when they form a committee and I 'm not on it , I begin to wonder . But you must admit it 's a hell of a way for a man to go through life , and with nothing to show for it but a few silver trays and an umbrella . Yes , one committee gave me an umbrella . Not a walking stick . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , and I 've been afraid to ask . " Wall Street and Throgmorton Street were carefully kept out of the men 's conversation , as were women , politics and all other topics that would call for complete and mutual trust or that could be mentionedp434on Monday as having been discussed at James D. MacHardie 's house . Nothing was said that was worth repeating to a speculator or a politician or Town Topics . And yet in the presence of such impenetrable discretionAlfred sensed the practice of power , and if MacHardie or Sevringhamhad said anything memorable about the New York , New Haven &; Hartford , Alfred would have been disillusioned . He had never been on such terms of familiarity and informality with a man of MacHardie 's standing in the financial community , and MacHardie had behaved in a manner true to form  --  until , that is , the gentlemen rose to join the ladies . MacHardie looked at his watch , allowed the man speaking to finish what he was saying , and then laid both hands on the tavern table and leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay a call in the little room in the corner , I suggest we . . . " He did not complete the sentence . They all rose , but Alfred felt that he was being held back by MacHardie 's smile and he waited while the others moved toward the stairs , leaving Alfred and MacHardie somewhat alone . In a quiet tone , not a whisper but inaudible to the others , MacHardie said : " I wonder if you could have lunch with me at my office , next Wednesday at twelvefifteen ? Just say your name to the man at the door . May I count on you ? " " Yes sir , thank you . " " Good . " " What do you think he wants ? Is that all he said ? It sounds like an order , a command , " said Mary . " It is . " They were in bed , reporting to each other all details of the party . " Oh , I can hardly wait to tell Mother . And Daddy . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's going to offer me a job . He would n't waste his time otherwise . At least he would n't have me make the trip to Wall Street . He 's too considerate for that . It 's a job . But what , I do n't know . " " Whatever it is , take it , " said Mary . " This shows how clever Mother is. , , " How clever is she ? " " Well , not clever , but she does know people . When I told her that it was James D. MacHardie 's grandson you saved , she said , That 's his only grandson and there 'll be no limit to how grateful he 'll be . ' And she was big enough to admit something , too . " " What was she big enough to admit ? " " That I was right about you and she was wrong about Jim . " " Jim MacHardie ? " " Jim Roper , you silly . Jim Roper never would have been playing tennis on a Sunday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " As far as that goes , I should have been , too . Studying how much we spent that week at the N. A. C. "  | " Well , you were n't , so luck was with you . And luck is half the battle . That was the trouble with Jim Roper . He 's an unlucky person and I despise him . " " You do n't despise him . " " Do n't I ? I 'd never do this to Jim Roper . " " I hope not . " " I never did . But I like doing it to you . You like me to do this to you ? " " You know I do . " " Yes , you do like it , do n't you ? " " You can see I do . " " Yes , I can see you do . You would n't want me to be anyone else , would you ? That Lady Sevringham . She was flirting with you . " " No . " " Or Mrs. Duffy , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Nobody but you . " " I do n't want you to think about anyone else . " " I wo n't . " " Put out the light , will you , honey ? " " Anything you say . " " Do n't talk any more . Let 's just do n't talk but make love in the dark . " The things that were different about what she said and did this night he put down to her excitement over his coming meeting with James D. MacHardie . He considered himself extremely wise and knowing to realize she was seeing him with new respect and that this fresh reappraisalof him made her want to be especially pleasing to him . But it was unusual for her to be asleep when he came back to bed after openingthe windows and having a look at the baby . She was asleep , far on her own side of the bed , breathing regularly , and soon he too was asleep . There was a number but no name-plate at the entrance to MacHardie &; Company , a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to frugality . " Think of the money that Scotchman saves on metal polish , " they said . And : " After all , one of those brass signs is only good for fifty or sixty years , and then you have to get a new one . " And : " Old Jamie 's afraid the Salvation Army will find out where he is and come around for some of those suits . " The uniformed guard just inside the revolving door spoke to Alfred before he could ask for directions . The man , tall and white-haired and clean-shaven , touched his cap in a semi-military salute and said : " Mr. Eaton , sir ? " " Yes . " " Across this room into the hall at the far end , and it 's the fourth door on your left . Room marked eight , sir . Room 8 . " Alfred knocked on the door of Room 8 and it was opened by a manservantin a sort of livery : black business suit , black shoes , wing collar and starched white bow tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform the man from servant to another anonymous bookkeeper . " Good afternoon , sir . May I take your hat and coat ? I 'll just hang them on this clothestree where they 'll be in plain sight when you wish to leave . Sherry and a biscuit , sir ? " " No thank you . " He had scarcely selected a chair in this pictureless but comfortable room when James D. MacHardie entered . Immediately Alfred saw a man who was totally unlike the worried grandfather and uneasy host . His gait was heavier and firmer , his shoulders were squarer , his hands hung at his sides , and the barest nod sent the manservant out of the room . " Good afternoon , Mr. Eaton . Quite cool corning in this morning , was n't it ? If you 'll keep that chair , I 'll take this one and the table will be here . You do n't take anything before lunch ? " " No sir . " Here 's our table . Are you going to be comfortable ? " " Yes sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servant served their consomme vermicelli , and retreated to a corner while they drank it , which MacHardie did in three gulps , between lines of conversation . " A great pleasure to have you and your charming wife Friday evening . She 's a very agreeable conversationalist . A touch of the Southern accent I find easy on the ears , and she has wit . She has an original way of expressing herself . I 've met Mr. St. John on two occasions . And your son was named Rowland after his maternal grandmother 's family . I had n't realized that before . " He leaned over to his left and made a motion to start turning his head , which was all that was necessary as a signal for the servant to remove the soup cups and serve the next course . " I have a glass of milk with my lunch , " said MacHardie , implying a question . " Yes , I 'd like a glass of milk . " Liver and bacon , string beans , boiled potatoes , and milk were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very good , sir , " said Simmons , and departed . MacHardie picked up his knife and fork , Continental fashion , and commenced his meal and his statement . " We have here , have had in recent years , a training course that we do n't call a training course . In the first place , a man who works for us is making , or trying to make money for us , and if he has to tell his friends he 's taking a training course it does his dignity no good , and it does n't give our outside connectionsmuch confidence in him . It is not the Harvard School of Business Administration or the Wharton School of Commerce &; Finance . There is no prescribed curriculum of textbooks , although we do recommendcertain reading if our young men have n't had it . I say young men . The term may be misleading . We have n't made a practice of offering this course to recent undergraduates . Most of the men have been past twenty-five and in two cases , past thirty . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are a private bank and a house of issue . Are you familiar with those terms ? " " As a house of issue you sell stock ? " " That 's all it is . We will look at a given property and supply its banking needs , and in some cases , but not all , we will also arrange for the sale of stock in this given property . However , we do not sell stock in a concern for which we do not also supply the banking facilities . " Our greatest success in our not-so-called training course has been in sending young men out to investigate properties , considering their reports , and acting on them to the best of our ability . We do not by any means rely entirely on the young men 's reports , but we have been known to do so . Sometimes with successful results , sometimes not . " The young men to whom we offer this opportunity , and it is an opportunity , have almost invariably had some business experience other than in the general field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say we prefer young men who have not been dealing in stocks and bonds and so forth , and have had no experience in a bank . We can get such men , that is , men who have had that experience , but we do n't want them . We 'd rather have a man who 's run a small grocery store , or a fruit cannery . Too many men come down here and get into banks and brokerage houses and never do learn what those pieces of paper actually represent . " We do not expect any young man to come here at a financial sacrifice . Consequently there is no fixed salary for those who participate in this training course of ours . A man is given in any case a salary he can live on , because almost immediately he is given considerable responsibility . " We have never had a refusal , but before I actually offer you a job with us , are you interested ? " " I 'm interested , and I 'm honored . " " Thank you . Naturally you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thereby earned my personal gratitude . But all that served to do was to call attention to you . We are not in the habit of hiring men who qualify as life guards and nothing more , and I would never allow my personal gratitude to influence me in a matter that would involve this firm . I have eight partners . But in your case , having met you and been favorably impressed by intangibles that had nothing to do with your expertness as a swimmer , I made inquiries , and I am now in possession of a set of facts concerning you that I daresay is as complete as any ever compiled . These include transcripts of your marks at the Knox School and Princeton , your Navy record , your health report  --  we have a participating interest in an insurance company  --  your credit rating , and such other out-of-the-ordinary facts as the time you were beaten up at Princeton , your close relationship with your maternal grandfather , and various extremely private matters concerning your family . We are , or our agents are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at the same time , with a limited opportunity to get to know you , I have been most strongly influenced by my own , call them hunches , although I detest that word for what it means down in this part of the city . Now , is there anything you would like to know about us ? " " Yes sir . Are all the men who took the training course still with MacHardie &; Company ? " " Twenty-eight men have taken it . One did not come back with us after the war . He renounced us for the fleshpots of Paris . He was a good man , too , but he wanted to write music , so he 's better off where he is . One left us to go into his father-in-law 's business , a large going concern in the prairie states . One is on sick leave and I 'm sorry to say has tuberculosis and he may not be back . And two of them did not live up to our expectations , possibly through no fault of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still with us , some as long as ten years . The men who have been here ten Years have made enough money to retire . By that I mean , each of them is worth a sum fairly well up in six figures . Neither one has a million . " " Why not ? " MacHardie smiled . " You all have that goal of a million , have n't you ? " " No sir . I want much more than that . " " How much more ? " " Well , sir , not to be impertinent , but as much as you have . I do n't want to stop at what my father had . " " Let me ask you a question . What would you do if you had five million today ? " " Today ? I 'd wait till you offered me a job , and then I 'd take it . " " That is the right answer . Because there 's no limit to what you can earn here , within reason . You certainly should have five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will no matter where I go . I want to have five million by the time I 'm forty . " " Fifteen years ? That 's $340,000 a year . " " I do n't look at it that way , Mr. MacHardie . It might be impossible for me to make $340,000 a year every year , but it wo n't be impossible for me to make two million in one year and half a million for six years . " " How is this money to be made ? Speculation ? " " Naturally . That 's how all money is made , all big money . A company that pays big returns on a small investment is speculative or it would n't pay the big returns . " " There is such a thing as information , Mr. Eaton . " " That would be my job , would n't it ? " " There is also such a thing as misinformation , and loss . " " Loss would account for the nine years that I did n't make much . " " Another question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partner in this firm ? " " I 'm imagining it for the moment , yes sir . "  | " Will you explain to me why your present partnership is unsatisfac-tory ? " " I could give you a lot of explanations , and some of them you already know . " " I still want to hear your explanation . " " Well , it finally comes down to this : I want to make money , and my principal associates at the plant just want to spend it . " " So I am told , " said MacHardie . " Well , sir , how long will it take you to arrange your affairs ? " " Three months . " " You 've given it thought . " " Naturally . Two months to arrange things at the plant , and one month with my father 's estate . " " Do you take coffee with your dessert ? " " Yes , please . A large coffee with sugar and cream . " " You will be hearing from Mr. Connifer . Mr. John T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of personnel . He 'll arrange the details . I 'll be abroad on the first of June and in any case your work wo n't be directly with me , but you 'll find that I 'm easily accessible . I have one of those roll-top desks you passed on the way in . I 'm pleased that you 're going to be with us , and I trust you 'll never have cause for regret . Misgivings once in a while , but not regret . This is the finest establishment of its kind in the United States of America , and we mean to keep it that way . Those words will have some meaning to you after you 've been here a while . Good day , Mr. Eaton . " He did not wait for dessert or coffee , but then he had not said he would . Simmons not only w . s accustomed to such behavior ; he was accustomed to explaining it ' . He came in with his watch in hand . " Mr. MacHardienever waits . " " I understood him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , he said twenty minutes . But that was only if he did n't finish before that . If your conversation lasted twenty minutes , I was to come in and that would remind him that the twenty minutes was up . He always does that . Sometimes fifteen minutes , sometimes half an hour . He wo n't have a ticker in here , but he does n't like to be away from it very long during trading hours . Remarkable man for his age . " " What is his age ? " " I do n't rightly know , sir . But I 've been here twenty-two years and he looked the same the first day I started . " Simmons finished serving the coffee and cabinet pudding , and stood with his hands behind his back . " May I ask , sir , are you going to be with us ? " " Yes I am . " " Then may I be the first to welcome you , sir ? I usually am . In our training course , Mr. Eaton ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall be here to wait on you the next time you have lunch in here . "  | " Are you quitting ? " " Oh , no . No sir . Very few ever quits MacHardie &; Company . But I 'm not getting any younger and five years is n't a long way off at my age . " " Oh . Five years before I have lunch in here again ? " " Five years minimum , sir . It 's a bit like the Army in some respects . Promotion is slow , you know , sir ? A year or two do n't mean very much in a firm like MacHardie &; Company . But I warrant you , the next time you do have lunch in here , this room 'll be exactly the way you see it now . Oh , I like it . It gives you a real feeling of something permanent . Out there , the same gentlemen at the same desks , conducting their business nice and quiet , never raising their voices like in some other firms down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , not one of the big ones . Those are the partners ' . The nine big desks are for the partners . Mr. Connifer will never be a partner . Mr. Connifer never had his lunch in here , if you see what I mean , sir . There may be two young men doing the same work for a while at the beginning , but everybody knows which one of them may some day be a partner and which one wo n't . If a young man starts out by lunching with Mr. Connifer , we all know he 's never going to be a partner . " Alfred finished his lunch and Simmons helped him on with his coat and said goodbye . The smile and the crispness of manner of the white-haired man at the street door revealed to Alfred that the word had got around , inexplicably , as it so often does in Wall Street and in the most secure prisons . " Good day , Mr. Eaton , " he said . Good day , and not goodbye . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred took the East Side subway to Grand Central , changed to a local to Fifty-first Street , and walked to the Racquet Club . There was only a slight chance that Fritz Thornton would not be there , and at the door Alfred confirmed his guess . He waited in the lounge until Fritz came out of the diningroom , accompanied , somewhat to his dismay , by Jack Warren , of Boston . Warren remembered him and then excused himself with a word to Thornton that he would see him again at four o'clock . " Did you want to talk to me about something special ? If so , we can go to the bar and I 'll build a fence around us , " said Thornton . " I 'm free until four o'clock , as you heard . " They went to Thornton 's favorite table . " What will you have ? I 'm going to have a bottle of Apollinaris water . " " So will I. " " With a slice of lemon . I prefer it that way . Before I forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than ten minutes ago . " " That 's good to hear . " " All right , Alfred . You may fire when ready . " " Well , I just have to start with a big long well . I have a lot to say . "  | " May I make one guess , and then I wo n't interrupt you again . You are getting out of the Nassau Aeronautical Corporation ? " " Yes. , , " I 'm not surprised . Now go ahead . " " Well  --  another well . You remember our last long talk , when I offered to buy up all the stock in the corporation ? I told you I 'd been to see this fellow in Texas , and he agreed to put up the money . I told you why I was doing it . I felt that with outside money that I had dug up , I would be in a better position to exercise my authority than I was as long as Lex and Von Elm knew the money came from you and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said then that you understood completely why I was doing it , and you appreciated the fact that I had n't done anything underhanded . " " Of course . " " To repeat what I said then , I did what I did because I thought it was for the good of the corporation collectively , and in the long run , better for Lex and Von Elm and me individually , and also relieved you of any feeling of responsibility . And then you said to me privately , you did n't want to be relieved of the responsibility , and that you thought that by offering to buy up all the stock , by doing that , I would achieve the desired effect , namely , to prove to Lex and Von Elm that I could buy it up , that I wanted to buy it up , and was in a position where I did n't have to feel that Lex had you on his side in any difference of opinion . And even if he did have you on his side , I did not depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was outnumbered , or there on sufferance , or any of those things . Somebody besides a member of Lex 's family had enough confidence in me to be willing to back me for a hell of a lot of money . " Now then , Lex flared up when I offered to buy up the stock , but then when he calmed down he realized that what I was really doing was to prove that I was at least as interested in making a go of it as anyone else , and possibly even a little more so . " " Which was true . You were n't using your uncles ' money , and Lex was . " " But he calmed down and as you predicted , for a while he tried to be more economical and not go on as though we , or you , had unlimited resources . But that was too good to last , and before long we were back at the same old problem . Just as bad as ever . And when you suspected that and faced me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elm , which I had the authority to do . Well , I said I would n't do that , that I would give it till Christmas . " I guess you wondered why I did n't say anything at Christmas , because you must have known that things had n't gotten any better . They 'd gotten worse . But oddly enough , they 'd gotten worse for a reason that was good . I 'm not trying to be What's-His-Name , the paradox guy , Chesterton . I would n't know how to make a paradox any more thanp442I 'd know how to make a parachute . I 'd rather read W. O. McGeehan than Chesterton anyhow . But what I mean by this paradoxical business is that I discovered something good , that is , favorable to the firm , that was bad for my position . I found out that Von Elm , no matter how much of a prick I think he is , or how careless he can be with other people 's money  --  he 's a good designer . How did I find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew God damn well , and I know God damn well , that we will never make any real money by trying to make aeroplanes for the people who buy Rolls-Royces . Do you know how many Rolls-Royces there are in this country ? Twenty-seven hundred . That 's all . I took the trouble to find that out . In a country of over 105,000,000 population , only twenty-seven hundred want to or can buy Rolls-Royces , and I agree with you that that 's a pretty good way to judge our market . Let 's say there are three thousand people who might even be slightly interested in buying a good , small aeroplane . Not enough . Lex always accuses me of wanting to make flivvers or Dodges , but I think it 's a financial fact that you have to stop somewhere and build one model and stick to it for a while . Mass produce , even on a small scale . But we 've had all this out before , and I know you 're more inclined to agree with Lex . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there could be a market for a good aeroplane in quantity . So I wrote a letter to a friend of my father 's and through him I went to Washington and spent three days talking to guys in naval aviation . I knew I would n't be able to talk their language very well , so I took some designs along with me , some drawings and blueprints . I did n't tell Lex or Von Elm . I did this entirely on my own . " Well , one officer wanted to throw me out of his office for wasting his time , but he was the only one . The others were like a bunch of kids on a farm , seeing their first electric train . One officer even said , Do you by any chance have a man named Von Elm working for you ? ' He 'd recognized some Von Elm touches . " Well , Christ , I thought , this is the best news since the Armistice , and I began rubbing my hands and counting the shekels . Can I count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . We 'll be in production next year . ' I made it 1923 because I wanted to give us a chance to get a few ships in the air before offering one to the Navy . " They all shook their heads . Not a chance . Congress would n't give them the money , and even if Congress did , the battlewagon men in the Navy were still sore as hell about buying a hundred engines from Wright . They liked that about as much as they liked old Daniels trying to make them drink grape juice . " All right , ' I said . We 'll give you one . We 'll sell you one for a dollar . ' Anything to get the Navy interested . But they would n't even take one as a gift . And anyway , all I had was drawings . I did n't have an aeroplane . Then I asked one nice guy , an officer , how about the Army ? I said I was pretty sure I could get to see General Mitchell.  |p443But  he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force it was called , and was making himself unpopular all over . In fact , I do n't think this officer liked Mitchell very much himself . So 1 never bothered to go see Mitchell or anyone else in the Army . I came home with my tail between my legs , because I not only could n't get any business , but I 'd found out that this shit Von Elm was really pretty good . " Mr. Thornton , that was the blow that killed father . I knew then that as far as the N. A. C. was concerned , my days were numbered . If it came to a real showdown , you 'd have to fire me , or I 'd have to quit . So I went on marking time , trying to decide what to do and how to do it , and then three Sundays ago on my way to your house to play tennis , I happened to hear a woman scream , and I guess you know the rest as well as I do . " " In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company . " " Yes . " " Well , let me be one of the first to congratulate you . " " As a matter of fact , you 're the first . And so far , the only one . I had lunch with him today , and I came here hoping to find you . I have n't even called up Mary . " " When does all this take effect ? " " I told Mr. MacHardie I needed two months to arrange things at the N. A. C. , and then I ought to spend another month with my father 's estate , things at the mill , insurance , and so forth . I start the first of June , I guess . " " Do you want me to break the news to Lex ? " " God , no . No thanks . That will have to be done with a bottle of whiskey on the table and maybe some eight-ounce gloves nearby . But I owe him that . " " Yes , I think you do . I was just thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's none of that . " " I 'll take my licking like a little man . " " I just hope Lex does  --  a different kind of licking . " " Yes , so do I. " " He may not , you know . " " I know only too well . " " I have an uneasy feeling that I was the one who rushed you two into this and you at least were too polite to say no . " " I have a feeling that most of the good things that Mr. MacHardie knows about me came from you . " " I wo n't deny that we had several conversations . But you made it on your own . He 's been looking for someone like you , and you owe me nothing . He owes me something , but you do n't . At the moment I have only one piece of advice for you . " " What 's that ? " " Watch out for Duffy , his son-in-law . He 's a smart Mick and he likes to pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in MacHardie &; Company , but I happen to know he 's never been offered any/thing by his father-in-law and I happen to know he 's boiling inside . He 'll never need money . He 's done well , and his wife will inherit , besides the money her father settles on her every five years . But he thinks the old gentleman has snubbed him because he 's a Catholic and made his wife join that church , and the child is being brought up a Catholic . That is n't the real reason Jim MacHardie does n't want him in the firm . Don Shanley 's a Catholic and he 's a MacHardie partner , and Jerry Sevringham is a good friend . But there 's a difference between a Catholic and a Mick , and Duffy is a Mick . Sharp , shrewd , brilliant , dresses well , good manners and all that . But when I meet an Irishman and I get that instinctive feeling that I ca n't trust him , I know he 's a Mick . I 've had it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooms , I have one that 's been with me for thirty years . Charlie McDonald is one of my best friends , and Charlie did n't have as good an upbringing as Duffy . Duffy 's family had a place on Long Island long before he ever married MacHardie 's daughter . I ca n't say any more than that I just do n't trust him . I suppose it 's a good thing I can classify them as Micks and just Irishmen . " The only other piece of advice is that everything you do at MacHardie &; Company is made a part of your record . Five or ten years from now you 'd be surprised to find out that they know you stayed in Chicago one day longer than necessary , or you had a margin account for two weeks because you had a hot tip . They 'll know if you 've had trouble at home , and they 'll also know that you won a handicap tournament at Piping Rock . It 'll all be down on paper . They 're famous for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I had to know where I was on a certain night ten years ago , I 'd find out at the office . ' He was only half-joking . Do n't get into any scandal , do n't get to be known as a drinker . And stay out of the newspapers unless you happen to get on the sporting pages with other men like yourself . And if I were you , I would n't come here so often . Do n't resign . But do n't make a regular habit of this place . " " I thought this place was the best . " " It is , of its kind . But if you 're here every day , or three or four times a week regularly , they naturally wonder how you can spare the time , and they also wonder why you do . Next year I 'll put you up at a smaller club , an older crowd . You wo n't get in before you 're thirty on account of the waiting-list . The people at MacHardie 's approve of this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's what a young man should do . But James D. MacHardie does n't expect his embryonic partners to have time for the Racquet &; Tennis Club life . Above all , never be found at the bar here at three o'clock in the afternoon . That could finish you . I 've always regretted that I was never tapped for MacHardie &; Company , and 1 'd like to see you make good in my stead . " " I 'd rather be you than any other man I know . " " Thank you , Alfred , but that is n't as true as it was two or three yearsp445ago , and it 'll become less true as you get older . But God ! I wish I had your life for the next forty years . I 'm certainly tired of mine . " Alfred remained silent . " That 's imposing on you . I should n't have done that . A statement like that makes you feel you have to make a reply , and there is no reply . . . This stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . Shall we try some of that so-called Gordon 's gin ? I 'm certainly not going to toast your new career in Apollinaris . " " Can we put it off till some other time ? It 's just that I 'd rather not have a drink now . " " Are you rushing off ? " " No , I 'm staying a little while longer . " " Oh ? Well , good . Good . " Alfred smiled . " You know , I know you better than I used to . " " Well of course you do , dear boy . " " I 'm not as easily fooled as I used to be . " " Now what 's behind that remark ? " " I think you know . You have a very clever way of steering the conversation in the direction you want it to go . Or at least away from something you do n't want to talk about . " Thornton smiled . " You 've caught wise , have you ? " " It took me long enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this time ? " " What I wanted to talk about , and you knew I wanted to talk about . " " In all probability . The stock ? " " Yes . " " I 'd like you to keep it . It may be worthless in a year , and you could n't sell it for much now . On the other hand , I wish you 'd keep it because you 've only been taking $50 a week for your salary . If this little corporation should ever amount to anything you 've more than earned your share . Call it half business and half sentiment , if you like . " " Mostly sentiment . " " Your stock is n't worth its face value , you 'll agree there . Nowhere near . It would make the bookkeeping much easier if you just kept what you have . And technically , you ca n't sell it to anyone but me or my brother or Lex , and naturally if we refuse to buy , you 're left holding it . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , so you ca n't buy any and I would n't accept payment for what you hold . Therefore , Alfred , you remain a stockholder willy-nilly . " Alfred laughed . " You 've worked that out very neatly . " " I think so . Lord knows , in years to come you may want to have your stock certificate as a souvenir of your first business venture , and the way it looks now , that and the experience will be all you 'll have to show for it . I am extremely pessimistic about the future of the Nassau Aeronautical Corporation , and that is n't mere politeness because you 're leaving . What you found out about Von Elm is precisely true ,  |p446the  good and the bad . I did some inquiring on my own , and that 's why I never came to your support as you probably thought 1 should have . I found out he was good , or promising , and if 1 'd supported you and tied a tincan to his tail , I would have been doing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm glad you 're not going to have it on your record that you failed to appreciate him . You 'll make mistakes , Alfred , but oddly enough , the mistakes that are remembered in businessare not always business mistakes . Oftener than not they 're mistakesin personal judgment , judgment of other men . As I see it , twenty years from now Von Elm is going to have it on his record that he could n't get along with you , a very easy man to get along with . 1 'd much rather have it that way than vice versa . " " You win . It 's easy to lose to you . I never really lose by it . " Thornton bowed . " Would you like to wait around for Jack Warren ? He 's a very good connection to have in State Street , although Devonshire Street is where he has his office . " " I imagine it 'll be a long time before I need any high connections . " " Never hurts , but I suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the way , how 's your neck ? " " Practically healed . " " That 's where the chicken got the ax , so bear that in mind , Alfred . But I know that this is one of the most important days in your life , and you know you have my hearty good wishes and my promise to be of any assistance at any time . " " 1 know that if I know anything at all . " The main office of the Buffalo , Fort Penn &; Trenton was in Fort Penn , a fact which in certain other circumstances might have hurt the pride of citizens of Buffalo ; but while the millionaires of Delaware Avenue were as proud of their city and as sensitive to a profitable operation as citizens anywhere , they were also quite aware that they had allowed the old Buffalo &; Fort Penn to slip away from them almost unnoticed , and when they eventually realized that James D. MacHardie had been quietly puttingtogether the Buffalo , Fort Penn &; Trenton , it was far too late to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn had become , or very nearly become , one of the joke railroads of which Americans are so fond . As the initials on the cars of the Delaware , Lackawanna &; Westernwere said to mean Delay , Linger &; Wait , the Buffalo &; Fort Penn initials on its rolling stock stood for Bad For Passengers , a title that was not altogether inaccurate . Most of the standard American jokes about poor railroad service applied to the Buffalo &; Fort Penn ; its equipment , its right of way , its personnel , and its methods . When the announce/ment came that James D. MacHardie had effected a merger of the Buffalo &; Fort Penn with an almost mysteriously unknown New Jersey railroad , Buffalonians uttered the hope that the newly organized system would put up a new station , not necessarily so elaborate as some then a-building , but a substitute for the crumbling eyesore that had served the traveling public so many years . The prayer went unanswered , the station got worse than ever , and the line itself was not regarded as a credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the only regrets were mild , lingering ones on the part of a few gentlemen at the Saturn Club who had not known of James D. MacHardie 's interest until it was too late . They could take some consolation from the knowledge that gentlemen just like them at the Fort Penn Club had been no smarter , nor was there any jubilation in the Trenton Club . It was obvious from the beginning of the Buffalo , Fort Penn &; Trentonthat the new owners had no intention of losing money for the sake of prestige . The passenger trains fulfilled the requirements of the system 's franchises , but no more . A Fort Penn millionaire might have his new Pierce-Arrow shipped from Buffalo via the B. F.-P . &; T. , but on a journey between the two cities he would unhesitatingly take the Pennsy , which would deliver him at his destination on time and reasonablyclean . The B. F.-P . &; T. liked to carry coal , iron ore , iron and steel products and , least of all , mixed freight , and the merger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in the anthracite region of Eastern Pennsylvania and the growing industrial area from Trenton westward to Fort Penn . Most of the business in coal was dependent on the line 's arrangements with the large and small independent coal operators , since the Pennsylvania and the Reading , the Lehighs and the Delawares had extremely friendly ties with the largest mining corporations . It had not been so long since the mining and railroading operations had been separated by the government , one of the rare instancesof government interference to have the tacit approval of James D. MacHardie . But it was not to the main office in Fort Penn that Alfred Eaton was sent in the autumn of 1927 . MacHardie &; Company received daily reports from Fort Penn , voluminous ones by mail for the less urgent reports , by leased telephone and telegraph wires for the questions needing ready answers . On an October morning he was told by his secretary that Mr. Hasbrouck would like to see him . " Ah , hello there , Alfred , " said Hasbrouck . " Good morning , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , facing Hasbrouck , who as a partner rated one of the nine roll-top desks . " Alfred , you come from Pennsylvania . Port Johnson , I believe . " " Born and raised there , yes sir . Mother and father born and raised there . " " And your mother still lives there , if I 'm not mistaken . " " Still lives there , and so does one of my sisters . "  | " I knew most of these things , of course . No use pretending I do n't . But there are some things about your Pennsylvania background that I do n't know about . " " Thank God , " said Alfred . Hasbrouck , who enjoyed a mildly naughty joke , chuckled . " I do n't think I 'd like them to dig down too deep in Englewood , either . That 's where I spent my young manhood , and  --  well , the less said about some things the better , eh ? " " Check . " " Check and double-check , " said Hasbrouck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lantenengo County ? Coal . One word , and I 've used up all my information , I 'm sorry to say . " " It is n't very far from your town . You must have friends there . " " None . I 've never been there . No , that 's wrong . I was there once for about an hour . I 'm afraid I 'm not much help on Lantenengo County . In fact , I 'm not even sure what the principal town is . Is it Gibbsville ? Gibbsville belongs up there somewhere . " " Gibbsville is the county seat . " " I knew some fellows from Gibbsville in prep school and college , but they were never particular friends of mine , and I 've completely lost touch with them . And I 've never been to Gibbsville . I 've only been to a country club somewhere near there , and it was at night . There was a dance , but I did n't go to it , and I never even got inside the club . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is music to my ears . " " Oh . " " Exactly . " " Like the Louisiana sulphur proposition ? " " Exactly . The fewer people who know you , the better from our point of view . " " What are we after ? " " First , information . Second  --  as always , the second depends on the first . This has to do with Buffalo , Fort Penn &; Trenton , which , as you know , is one of our investments . At the moment we do n't go into Lantenengo County , but that does n't say we never will . Nor am I implyingthat we intend to . But within twenty-five miles of Gibbsville there are eighteen independent coal companies , aside from the illegal bootleg coal operations . These eighteen have no connection with the big fellows , the Reading , or the L. C. &; N. " " What 's that ? " " Lehigh Coal &; Navigation . " " Oh , yes . Shows how little I know about it . " " You recognized the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlookingsomething worthwhile there . They 've had a bad strike in the anthracite coal industry and they lost a considerable amount of their domestic market to oil . Nevertheless we have n't given up on coal or onp449coal mining or on coal-carrying . Coal is still our big source of revenue on the B. F.-P . &; T. , and they 're still mining it in Lantenengo County . You do n't have to concern yourself with how we 'll get in there if we want to . That 's for us to worry about . But if there 's a big future there in the independent operations  --  and there may be  --  we want our share of that business . " " You 're bucking the Pennsylvania and the Reading . I know that much . Their coal trains used to rumble through my home town , night and day , eighty-car trains . I know because I used to count them . " " Well , that 's quite true . The Reading gets the Coal &; Iron Companybusiness , naturally . The Pennsylvania  --  well , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that , and I 'm glad you do because you have some perspective on it . But we 'd like you to go down there , or over there , or whatever you choose to say , and spend a couple of months looking around . You know how to sell a bond ? " " Yes . You say , Would you like to buy a bond , mister ? ' and you either sell it or you do n't . " " Except that in this case , you wo n't be in a hurry to leave the office if you do n't sell a bond . You will be there as a new man for Rowley &; Cruickshank , opening up new territory . That will give you an excuse to be chatty and friendly . All new bond salesmen are chatty and friendly and all small-town bankers like to chat , except when they 're half expecting a surprise visit from the bank examiners . " " Do I get the four dollars if I sell a bond ? I have a wife and two children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it was five . Whatever it is , yes , you can keep the commission . Rowley &; Cruickshank will supply you with a small car and their various lists . It 's getting a little late for golf , but take your sticks with you . However , you are not to confine yourself to bankers . Rowley 's will give you the names of business men , priests , dear old ladies , lawyers  --  all sorts of people . I would n't waste too much time on the dear old ladies , but a priest knows as well as anyone in the town if a mine is in good shape . Doctors the same . Are people paying their bills ? It 's almost wide open down there so have a good look at the saloons . " " That part is always a pleasure . " " Yes . You see , if the owners are letting the mines go to pot , that 's important for us to know . The state has strict mining laws , but I understand they 're not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervision at all . " " What are these bootleg operations ? I do n't understand that . " " It 's stealing , and it 's getting to be an industry . When a big operation shuts down , the miners sink their own shafts and take the coal and sell it by the bucketful . " " Why do n't the owners stop them ? " " They do n't dare . Bloodshed . There 's going to be some trouble , be/cause some of the miners are stealing it by the truckload and carting it away to Philadelphia , Reading , probably your home town . " " They wo n't get rich in my home town . Since our mill shut down there are n't many people who can afford coal . " " Well , you 'll learn about bootleg coal mining , Alfred . We have a lot of figures on tonnages  --  legitimate , legal tonnages  --  and all the rest of the figures . But we would like you to find out the kind of thing that does n't show up on Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may come across something like that splendid sulphur proposition . I may as well tell you , Mr. MacHardie is taking a personal interest in this trip of yours . " " Well , I 'll do my best . " " We know that . You always do . " " Will I be able to come home on weekends ? " " I 'm afraid not . Not for the first month . I imagine that when you get there you 'll find that you get a lot of your best information on Saturdays and Sundays . Are you a churchman ? " " I was christened but I do n't think I was ever confirmed . I 'm an Easter Episcopalian . Not much help there , I 'm afraid . " " Well , we ca n't have everything . You might spend this afternoon over at Rowley &; Cruickshank 's and I suggest you leave here next Sunday . " " Oh , my wife is going to love that . Our second Sunday in the new apartment and she 's asked some people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacHardie &; Company , " said Hasbrouck , with an attempt at levity , but without yielding . " I had to give up a month at Fishers this past summer while Mr. MacHardie was abroad . But it 's worth it . I 've never made any sacrifice for the firm that I did n't feel amply repaid , and not always the money consideration . " " I 'm not complaining , but my wife will . " " They often do , " said Hasbrouck . " Now there are one or two men who could be helpful to you , who do n't fall into any of the classificationsI 've already mentioned . One is a politician named Slattery . He lives in Gibbsville . As a general rule we stay away from politicians , but this fellow is safe . We 've tried him out on any number of things and found him reliable . You can go to him if you 're stuck for anything , but do n't go to him if you do n't have to . We always prefer to have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him know you 're there . At least in your true identity . It 's quite likely that you 'll run across him , but on the other hand you may not . But if necessary you can tell him who you really are . " " It should n't be necessary . " " No , it should n't . But we have him there in case it is . Mike Slattery . A Republican , by the way . Do n't be misled by the name . In Lantenengo County the Democrats do n't elect . The other fellow is a man we 've had our eye on for some time . In the deepest confidence , if we ever decide to go into the mining of coal in that section , this man is the one we'dp451like to take charge . His name is Ralph Benziger . R. W. Benziger . He is general superintendent of the Mountain City Coal Company , the largest of the independents in that section . I would like you to go and see him and I 'll have Rowley 's give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Benzinger ? " " Benziger , without the second n . Benziger . Now in this case , under no circumstances must you let him know who you are . The letter will simply say that you are a new man with Rowley &; Cruickshank , and any small courtesies , et cetera . Perfectly logical , because Benziger has a small account at Rowley 's , and Rowley 's have done some business with Mountain City . If he 's aware that there is any connection betweenRowley 's and MacHardie &; Company , well , it 's no secret . Everybodyknows that there 's some connection , everybody that takes the trouble to find out such things . " Benziger  --  I do n't want to prejudice you  --  but he 's one of the nicest fellows I ever met . I met him in Philadelphia two years ago and then again last year . He did n't know it , but the meetings were not accidental . He has no idea that he was being looked over , and I 'm the only partner who 's seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's never been in this office . He probably knows that I 'm a partner in MacHardie &; Company , but I 'm not even sure of that . He is not a rich man . He may be worth three to four hundred thousand , most of it in Mountain City . He works like a mule , but with a great deal more intelligence . He 's the old-style mining engineer . High school education , engineering corps , self-taught , even studied a little chemistry at the I. C. S. The men in the mines trust him because he 's shown in the past that he 'll put on a pair of rubber boots and a miner 's cap and go inside if necessary . He 's not afraid to dirty his hands , they say . He 's had less labor trouble than almost any general superintendent , but he 'll stand up to the union officials whenever the local superintendent ca n't handle a dispute . Now we know these things about Benziger , but we want to know all we can , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's in his early fifties , but I 'd like you to get to know him if you can . He will probably invite you to dinner at his house , and if he does , I leave the rest to you . This will never be as big as the Louisiana sulphur proposition , but it 's the first one you wo n't have any help on . This is all yours . Stay two months at least , more if you feel it 's necessary . After that you 'll have a week to dictate your report , and then Mr. MacHardie wants you to lunch with him . In the little room . Good luck . " Mary received the news without enthusiasm but without displeasure . " And you 're not to come home at all for the first month . Of course they mean by that that they hope you do n't ever come home . " " I 'll come home the end of the first month , you can be sure of that . " " And of course I 'm forbidden to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enough said . All right . Every year they seem to send you on longer trips . " " This is n't very far . About two hundred miles , I 'd say . " " I was n't talking about distance . " " And I was in Louisiana longer than a month . " " But there I was allowed to come down and see you . The trouble with these companies , they 're all run by old men . It is n't good for young couples to be separated for such long spells . What 's more , I got the curse today , so that takes care of that till you get home . No fond farewell on Sunday morning . " " Well , God damn it , that 's my luck . " " Your luck ? It 's my luck , too . That 's what I mean about old men . And you wo n't even be here Sunday afternoon ? I 've invited thirty people . Will you call up Forty-two West Forty-nine and order the liquor ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out and pick up my clubs anyway . " " Are you taking them with you to Pennsylvania ? " " Hasbrouck suggested it . " " And your Tuck , too ? " " I guess I 'd better , to be on the safe side . " " I thought you were going to bury yourself with a lot of coal miners . Does n't sound much like that to me . " " They have a country club there . I 've seen it . " " Oh , good-ee . And I sit here with two small children , one of them teething . It is n't fair , you know . " " Alex is teething ? A fever usually goes with that , does n't it ? I did n't know he 'd started teething . " " How would you ? You 're never home long enough . " " Oh , come on , Mary . " " If you 're going to be playing golf and going to country club parties , I 'm not going to just sit here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " I mean if somebody asks me to go to the theater . " " Go to the theater . " " What if it 's somebody you do n't know ? " " That 's different . " " That 's what you 'll be doing . " " I do n't want you having dates with guys I do n't know . If Lex or somebody wants to take you to the theater , okay . But not a stranger . " " Lex  --  all he wants to do is sit in a speakeasy . What if it 's somebodyyou do know and do n't like ? " " For instance ? " " Jim Roper ? "  | " No . What made you think of him ? " " He 's coming Sunday afternoon . " " How did that happen ? " " I saw him on the street and I invited him . " " I 'm glad I 'm not going to be here . " " Maybe it 's just as well you 're not , if that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . I 'll tell you what else is my attitude . You 're not going out with Jim Roper . That 's final . " " Final ? Do n't be too sure . " " I 'm not at all sure , but you 'd better be . " " This is 1927 . " " Yes , and you have n't learned much if you think I 'm going to letyou go out with that prick . I do n't care if it 's nineteen forty-seven . " " He 's not a prick . You have friends that I think are worse pricksthan Jim Roper . " " They do n't happen to be in love with you and screwing some nurse on the side . Not that that would be very easy . Screwing a nurse on the side . " " Oh , you 're so witty . " " I am sometimes . Sometimes I surprise myself . If you 'll excuse me , now , I 'm going in and have a look at the baby , and congratulate him on having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , **28;29;TOOLONG . " " Oh , go piss . " " On the way , dear . On the way . Thanks for reminding me . " Roper was not again mentioned and Alfred took off for Pennsylvania . He was halfway to Phillipsburg before a slight fear grew up in the midst of the homesickness and eagerness for the new assignment that occupied his thoughts on the dull ride across New Jersey . He happened to look at his watch , saw that it was past six o'clock , and imagined the apartment , crowded with thirty guests and noisy with the sounds of Mary 's cocktail party . He knew who had been invited ; all of them friendly , some of them decorative  --  and Jim Roper , serious with the dignity of his new degree , resentful of the others ' money , confident of his attraction for the women , and free to pick his moments with Mary . Two hours later Alfred was in Gibbsville . He had a drink of whiskey in his room at the John Gibb Hotel , then went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked along the main street until he saw a crowded Greek restaurant . He sat at the counter and ate half a dozen fried oysters and some French fried potatoes . The people in the restaurant were loud and rather drunken , and from their conversations Alfred finally learned that most of them were celebrating the victory of the Gibbsville football team over the Providence Steamrollers . A girl left her table and walked around the counter and tickled Alfred 's ear . " You 're that Providence left end , I know you . "  | " Nope . Sorry . " " You played awful dirty . You should have been kicked out of the game . " " I was . " " No you were n't , but you should have . But you 're cute . Come on over and sit with us . We have a quart . " " No thanks . I 'm in training . " " For what ? I 'll bet you 're married . " " Right the first time . " " Well , so am I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with the glasses ? That 's who I 'm supposed to be married to . Come on , I want to introduce you . Wud you say your name was ? " " I 'm sorry , little friend , but I have to get going . " " You got a car ? " " Why ? " " Meet us at the Stage Coach . We 're all going to the Stage Coach . You go to the Stage Coach and I 'll meet you in the bar . I do n't promise anything but I 'll bet you wo n't be sorry . I wo n't promise , mind you , but if I like a person . Here . " She took his hand and crushed it to her breasts . " I hate to say no to a lady , but I 've got to beat it . " " Wuddia mean you got to beat it ? " " Just that . I got to be on my way . " " Oh , you do . Well , fuck you , Buckley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter on the counter and laid down the exact change at the cashier 's desk and returned to the hotel . The girl had not been bad-looking . Still in her twenties , with a tight round figure and resistance in her breasts . The man she had pointed out as her husband had never looked at her when she left the table . MomentarilyAlfred was pleased that she had picked him out , and the promise that she had insisted was not a promise was exciting . But alone in his room he felt relief to have escaped not only the girl , but the attachment and its possible effect on his assignment . He looked at his watch , then put in a telephone call to Mary . He heard the maid tell the operator that Mrs. Eaton was not expected back before midnight , and he canceled the call . He read The Saturday Evening Post and The Literary Digest and went to sleep with the light on . He paid six calls on banks during the next day 's business hours and at three o'clock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sales , but in each case he had asked if he could stop in again in a week or two , and the prospective customers all gave their consent , with the admonition that Thursday , Friday and Saturday were bad ; payrolls , store business , and so on . It began to appear  --  and he was learning  --  that a salesman 's worst enemy is time ; too little of it , and too much of it . In a week , at the present rate , he would have visited all the banks on his list . He would have established his new identity . He remembered that any stranger in Port Johnson had been a markedp455man , and it was important to have the curious know who he was . He decided to cover the county banks in the first week and worry about the rest of the assignment later . At six o'clock he telephoned Mary . " I called you last night , " he said . " We went to Michel 's . " " How was the party ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all loved the apart-ment . " " Who did you have dinner with ? " " There were seven of us . Peg and Bill , Edith and Joe , and Lex and Jim Roper and I. " " Jim Roper managed to horn in ? " " He did n't horn in . He came along . " " Who brought you home ? " " Jim did . " " What time ? " " I think it was about twelve-thirty , might have been a little later . " " Did you ask him to come up ? " " Yes . " " Why are you making me ask a question for every step of the way ? " " Because I do n't want to make it easy for you . " " You 're not . How late did he stay ? " " Not late . About an hour . " " Possibly two o'clock . Did he make a pass at you ? " " No . " " Naturally I believe that . Are you seeing him again ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peg and Bill 's on Friday . I 'm goingthere for dinner . " " And he 'll undoubtedly bring you home . " " Possibly . I do n't know . " " You know what you 're doing , do n't you ? " " I always know what I 'm doing . Do you know what you 're doing ? " " Never mind me for the moment . You 're showing this son of a bitch that as soon as I leave town , you 're ready to go out with him . " " I 'm not showing him anything at all . But I 'm showing you that I do n't intend to stay cooped up in this apartment while you play golf and go to country club parties and call it business . " " Well , now 1 ' 11 tell you something . I hereby forbid you to have Jim Roper in the house . " " I suppose you can do that . " " I can do it , and I 've done it . The next step is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . So make up your mind . Stop having him in the house or I 'll come back to New York and tell him myself . He 'll have a hell of a time explaining a shiner to his doctor friends . " " Yes , you 'd do that , I guess . Very well , I wo n't have him in the apartment . Is that all ? " " No . Let me speak to Rowland . "  | " Before you do , I have something to say . " " I 'll be delighted to listen . " " Just this . You 're making a big thing out of nothing . " " I do n't happen to believe that . You 're my wife and I 'm not going to let this fellow walk in and do to our marriage the same thing that 's happened to others we know about . I 'm not making a big thing . It is a big thing that 's happening now . " " I 'll call Rowland . " In a moment the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy . This is Rowland . " " Hello , boy . " " Where are you ? " " I 'm in Gibbsville , Pennsylvania . " " Is Grandmother Eaton there with you ? " " No , she 's quite a distance away from here . " " Is Aunt Sally there ? " " No , she 's in Port Johnson . " " Is Aunt Constance there ? " " No , she 's with Grandmother . " " Are you all alone ? " " Yes . All alone . Very much so . " " What did you say ? " " I said very much so . How are you ? What did you do today ? " " You ask me too many questions . " " You 're your mother 's son . " " What ? " " I said how are you ? " " Fine . How are you ? " " Fine , thank you . How is your brother ?

" He could hear the disconnect signal , and he hung up , but not withoutthe suspicion that Mary had heard his last question to the boy , The roads were not too well marked and in his week of calling on bankers he lost his way several times , but he completed that part of his assignment on Wednesday afternoon , and thus was left with half the week open . Mary did not telephone him , and he was tempted to disobey Hasbrouck 's order and go back to New York , which he could almost certainly have done without Hasbrouck 's knowledge . But he was determined to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more importance to him than the quarrel with Mary . He could not in fairness characterize her as a quarrelsome girl ; she took pride in her house and her children and in her husband , and in her pride she was justified . The kids were inevitably called " Mennen 's food babies " and for reasons that were probably not unrelated to favorable comments about Alfred in Wall Street , as well as the photogenicquality of the children and their mother , they had been photographedfor the Sunday rotogravure section of the Herald Tribune : " Mrs. Alfred Eaton , Long Island young matron , and her interesting children , Rowland ( left ) and Alexander . Mrs. Eaton is the former Miss Mary St. John , of Wilmington , Del . " She had been asked to pose for a Pond 's advertisement , and on Alfred 's insistence had refused . She had by-passed the activities of the Junior League and she was highly selective in allowing her name to be used on lists of patronesses . She had , in other words , elected to subordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , a decision which was quite likely to be more rewarding in the future but prevented her from joining in the more obvious and immediate gayety of the larger young married set . On such matters she sometimes did quarrel with Alfred . " What harm can that do ? " she would ask . " None , but let 's stay out of the papers , " he would reply . He discovered that her mother had subscribed to the Herald Tribune for the society news and went through it every day for mention of Mary and Alfred . " Tell your mother we 'll be in Personal Intelligence every day  --  after I 'm made a partner . " Their other quarrels were not atypical for their life and the time . He would object to her deep decolletage for a fancy dress party ; she would complain about his falling asleep at the bridge table ; he would complain about a lack of the stiff collars he wore to work ; she would object to his readiness to break any engagement for the firm . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how trivial the cause of the quarrel , while it lasted she stayed in a fury , using words and combinations of words that he did not know she knew ( although she had learned them from him ) , and sometimes striking out at him with her fists . Then one evening in the midst of a quarrel he threw her on the bed and she lay there looking up at him with what he at first thought was hatred growing out of the quarrel , but almost immediately realized was something besides that . She was breathing deeply from the exertions of the quarrel , but then she slowly drew up her nightgown , all without taking her eyes off him , and for the first time he understood that there was a strong , direct connection between her angers and desire . He took her with almost no preliminary lovemaking , and later she asked him to forgive her for her bad temper , paid him compliments , spoke of love . Love-making did not become a means of settling all quarrels between them , but he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ) that if a quarrel led to love-making , or was followed by it , she retained no resentment ; and he possessed the corollary knowledge that resentment remained ifp458he did not make love to her while the heat of the quarrel lasted . In the latter event her resentment could continue for days , as it was doing now . But there was a difference in this quarrel . It was a double quarrel . It had begun with the announcement of his trip , it had not been dissolved in love-making , and in her resentment she had defied him , and he suddenly thought of Victoria Dockwiler . For a moment it was an alarming thought , as nearly all thoughts of Victoria Dockwiler were either alarming or saddening or sweet , but now he minimized his fears and dismissed them by summoning up the dissimilar facts of his last quarrel with Victoria and his present quarrel with Mary . There was really hardly anything that the two quarrels had in common , he told himself . This quarrel would just have to work itself out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor would he placate her with words of love . Now that decision was made , and he gained strength from it . He could turn now to an undistracted consideration of the work at hand . He got out his lists and read the names of Hasbrouck 's dear old ladies and priests and professional men , and they seemed on paper to be such an unattracting lot that he got out the letter to R. W. Benziger . On an impulse he telephoned the Mountain City Coal Company office , which he knew to be about fifteen miles away , and by merely asking to speak to Mr. Benziger he was put through to him . He introduced himself in his role as Rowley &; Cruickshank salesman , and asked for an appointment the next day . " Oh , I 'm very sorry , Mr. Eaton , but if you want to see me it 'll have to be before supper . I 'm going away tomorrow and I wo n't be back till a week from Sunday . " " Oh , I 'm sorry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your busiest . " There was a laugh . " I do n't know when I 'm at my busiest . But why do n't you come over anyway ? We could talk for ten or fifteen minutes , get acquainted . " " Unfortunately I 'm in Gibbsville . " " Hmm . Got a car ? " " Yes . " " Well , you can be here in half an hour if you think it 's worthwhile . I 'm not going to buy anything , but I know how it is to break in a new territory . Come on up , if you feel like it . " " I 'll be there in half an hour . " " Watch out about ten miles up the mountain . There was a big slide there early this morning . Must be about thirty tons of rock there . " It was dark when he got to the Mountain City office and the town was at least ten degrees colder than Gibbsville . Every bulb in the building was burning and the brightness ( and possibly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the end of the day for the office staff and Alfred arrived simultaneously with a party of men carrying lunch cans and transit , rod , tape-spools andp459other surveying equipment . All but one of the men were young , wore Army breeches and hob-nailed boots and they were all dirty-faced . Vaguely they reminded him of a group of junior officers from his Navy days . They were tired and ready for a bath , but they joked among themselves and made easy conversation with the girls of the office . Merely to see them was to feel very far removed from Hasbrouck 's list of dear old ladies and dear old men , and the thought abruptly brought him back to his purpose . Benziger 's office had a temporary look about it , in spite of the heavy furniture and enlarged photographs of collieries and tipples , firstaidteams and mule yards . The paperweights were lumps of sculped polished anthracite and a varnished spragger , and there were calendars and foot-rules bearing the names of firms that supplied the Mountain City Coal Company with dynamite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only personal touches were Benziger 's hat and coat , hanging from a wooden clothes-tree , and a Bachrach photograph of his wife , daughter , and son. f " Have a cigar , " said Benziger , after the exchange of greetings . He took a walnut humidor out of a drawer and offered it to Alfred . " This is the only thing I have to keep out of sight here . I could leave a ten-dollar bill on my desk and nobody 'd put a finger on it . But not a box of cigars . How long you been here , Mr. Eaton ? " " Since Sunday night . " " Drive ? " " Yes , I did . " " Came by way of Easton , I suppose , and that way ? " " Yes . " Alfred felt the not unfriendly study he was undergoing . " First time in the region ? " " First time , although I was born in Port Johnson . " " Oh . One of that family . Of course . Was that your father ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We had some dealings with your father 's mill , a long time ago . I met him only the one time . From then on everything went through our purchasing agent . Well , it 's always nice to do business with the second generation , but I 'm not in the market for any bonds just now . Excuse me , just one minute please . Ethel ! " His secretary opened the door . " You might as well go home . I 'll be here at seven , but you do n't have to come in till eight . " " I might as well be here at seven . Goodnight . " She closed the door . " I ca n't ask a good secretary to be here at seven o'clock in the morning , but she knows darn well I 'll need her . Uh , what are you doing for supper ? At home they always give me a steak the night before I go off on a trip . You wo n't get as good a steak at the John Gibb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold me . " " Sure it 's an invitation , " said Benziger . He picked up the telephonep460receiver . " Five one one , please . . . Natalie ? Dad . Tell Mother I 'm bringing a guest for dinner . Be there in fifteen minutes . . . There we are , Mr. Eaton . See how easy it is ? That was my daughter . I forgot to ask her whether she 's going to be home . There she is in that picture , with Mrs. Benziger and my son . My son 's a lawyer in Wilkes-Barre , graduate of Lafayette and the Harvard Law School . Just starting out . Daughter Natalie went to Miss Baldwin 's but did n't go on to college . Where did you go , Mr. Eaton ? " " Princeton , for two years only . " " Quit to go in the Army , I suppose . " " Navy . Then I never went back . " " No interest in making steel ? " " None whatever . " " Well , Ralph was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had him working on the engineering corps , summers , and I even had him what we call muckin ' in a drift , the lowest job in the mines . But he never cared anything for mining , and his grandfather , Mrs. Benziger 's father , was a very well-known judge in Wilkes-Barre , so we 're hoping he 'll follow in his footsteps . You have your car ? I 'll ride along with you and show you the way . I 'll send my driver home . " They put on their hats and coats and went out . A man in a cloth cap was sitting asleep at the wheel of a black Cadillac phaeton . " I do n't think I 'll wake him up , " said Benziger . " He 's been up since half past four this morning , and he 'll know I 've gone home when he wakes up . " " Did you get up at half past four , too ? " " No , I got up at five . Sharp left . He comes to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coffee . Then today , for instance , we drove to Scranton and had our breakfast and I transacted my business and we got back here around noon . Then I had to go to Gibbsville for bank meeting , and back here at four . So he 's gotten about a two-hour nap . Straight ahead . The only trouble is , some of the school kids know about him and how he takes naps , and they sneak up and blow the horn , and I 've had to give him merry hell for the language he uses to those kids . He 'll sleep there now for another hour . He can sleep anywhere , anytime . You talk about your colored gentry in the South , that fellow  --  well , he drove a motorcycle in France during the war . Dispatchrider . He 's been driving for me now for eight years last August , and he can still tell me stories . G. Dewey Hollingsworth , better known as Dewey . Knows more about the V-type eight-cylinder engine than the man that invented it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year old . Do you have any idea what the mileage on it is ? You can take a look at the speedometer . Fifty-four thousand miles . I could n't do that if I did n't have a man like Dewey . I 'm glad you stopped by , Mr. Eaton . I hope you 'll do it often , whenever you 're in the region . Now if you 'll just pull up at the white house with the iron fence , on your right . "  |p461They  got out of the car , and a dog growled . Alfred could not see the animal . " Rupert . Quiet , boy , " said Benziger . " Now we 're all right . " Benziger opened the gate and a handsome German shepherd came into sight . " He can be very embarrassing at times , but my wife and daughter are here alone a good deal at night . And the cook , but she 's a woman , too . I keep a .38 in my bureau drawer , and Natalie knows how to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we have to fire men in our business , and if one of them ever got drunk on this boilo they drink nowadays  --  new whiskey , still hot  --  he might come looking for me and I would n't be here . We live closer to the basic instincts than you might think . Down there , you ca n't see it now under this poor light , but at the end of this street last winter they found a man frozen to death . You do n't think of this part of the country being cold , but we have readings of fifteen , eighteen , twenty below . And you get off a road less than a mile from this house and you 're in scrub oak that all looks the same , and even people that were born here have been frozen to death . They start home a little drunk . In the summer , they fall down an air shaft . Get bitten by a rattlesnake . Drown in a dam . Not as bad as it used to be , but payday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month , a little oftener . And yet I have to say I love it . I would n't live anywhere else if you paid me . When these mountains around here are covered with laurel , or even snow , there 's something so beautiful about them , and to me , knowing them from the inside , having spent so many years in the coal-black insides of these mountains , with just a carbide lamp that only makes you realize the darkness of it , and the danger , always there , gas that you ca n't smell but that can kill you , and the coal above you and on all sides of you that can crush you . And the people . The men , their women . The Irish faces , especially of the old Irish men . The old ones , not the young . Dignity . Wisdom . Sorrow , and pride . Not much time left to them , and not much to show for working like niggers all their lives . But have a look at their skin sometime . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners are the cleanest laborers there are . They scrub every evening and every Saturday they shave . You 'll see an old man in his seventies or eighties and he 'll have the skin of a young girl but with a light in it that is n't a greasy shine . And the Polacks . The schwakies . I go to one of our collieries in the early morning , before they get the coal dust on their faces , and they get in the cage , line up to get in the cage , and I look at their faces and I can almost see them back on the steppes of Russia , not working in the mines , but riding horses with their swords swinging around and the reins in their teeth . Cossacks . Men who fight with knives . Wild men . Oh , well . Let 's go in . I always stand out here for a minute or two when I get home . Just that minute or so between my work and my home . It 's a habit I have . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Rupert to talk to , but he ought to understand me . He is n't far from being a wolf . "  |p462The  door was then opened by the most beautiful girl Alfred had ever seen . " Hello , Dad . " " Natalie , this is Mr. Eaton . " " How do you do ? Come right in , " she said . She swung the door wide and held out her hand . " How do you do , Miss Benziger . " They shook hands and she kissed her father . " Dad ? Like the side of a match-box . " " Ca n't think why . I shaved at five o'clock this morning . Growing boy , it ought to last me a week . " " Well , it wo n't . Let me take your hat and coat , Mr. Eaton . We have a place for them under the stairs , usually . But we 're having new shelves built . Did you hear that , Dad ? " " I heard it . They 're not finished yet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once all day . So I 'll take Mr. Eaton 's things . " She left them and Benziger led the way to a small room on the left . " This was intended to be a sort of a den , but as you see , it 's as much office as den . Wash up in there and I 'll be downstairs in a minute . " Alfred was alone for a moment when he came out of the lavatory . The room was overcrowded with souvenirs of Benziger 's past life and articles for his present ease . There were framed acknowledgments to his Red Cross and Liberty Loan activities in the war , a mounted bass , a mounted trout , the head of a deer , a cabinet containing four shotguns and a leather fishing - rod case , and everywhere framed photographs ; family snapshots and posed cabinet-size pictures of men . A presentation cigar humidor and a large silver cigarette box that needed polish . A desk with two small filing cabinets . Two telephones . A black leather sofa and three tufted leather chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bookcase containing technical volumes and textbooks and a 1922 Who 's Who in America . On the desk were the day 's Philadelphiaand New York morning newspapers , still in their wrappings . Alfred turned when he heard her step . " I 'd never seen a coal mine before last Monday . Is this one of your mines ? " He indicated a photograph he had been looking at . " It certainly is . That 's Number 4 . Dad wanted to name it the Natalie , after me , of course . But not seriously . There 's a Natalie company that we have nothing to do with . But Number 4 is the biggest our company has . This one is Number 1 , which of course is the oldest , but Number 4 is our pride and joy . When that was built it was the most electrified colliery in the world . This is my favorite room in the whole house . I always used to come in here to do my homework . " " Especially your arithmetic ? " " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father to help you . "  | " No , I was good in arithmetic . But he helped me with everything else . He 'll be here in a second and you can have a drink . " " I 'm in no hurry for one . " " Here 's Mother . Mother , this is Mr. Eaton . " " Good evening , Mr. Eaton . It 's very nice of you to come . " " It 's very kind of you to have me . And Mr. Benziger to invite me . This is the first house I 've been in since I got here , and you and Miss Benziger are the first Lantenengo County ladies I 've ever met . " " Yes , but how long have you been here ? " said Natalie . " Since Monday , but I 've had a lot of free time . " " Do you know anybody around here ? " said Natalie . " Until now , no . I know I went to school with some Gibbsville fellows , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? " said Natalie . " To prep school , a place called Knox , now defunct . " " I ca n't help you . Did you go to college ? " " Princeton , for two years , before you were aware of Princeton . " " I 'm twenty-two , and I 've been aware of Princeton for seven years . " " No , you have n't , Natalie . At fifteen ? " " I was aware of it . Ralph talked enough about it , although not complimentary-ly . Complimen-tarily . Ralph is my brother , and he went to Lafayette . " " Well , what 's everybody standing for ? Natalie , you know where I keep the liquor , " said Benziger . " Introductions all taken care of , let 's see what we 've got here . Mr. Eaton , the choice is gin and whiskey . The whiskey is pre-war , and the gin is made by one of our men in the lab . If you 're going to be around this section I 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like beer , there 's some good beer to be had , but not everywhere . A lot of it is etherized and some of it is just slop . " " You sound like an old toper , " said Mrs. Benziger . " Well , if I had n't married such a strict Methodist that 's what I 'd be . Let 's have whiskey , shall we ? Natalie ? Grace ? Mr. Eaton ? " " I 'd like gin , " said Natalie . " So would I , " said Mrs. Benziger . " I 'll have whiskey . I would n't pass up a drink of pre-war . " The drinks were served in shot-glasses with water chasers in tumblers . " Welcome to our fair city , welcome to our house , " said Benziger . They each had two drinks , and when they finished them Mrs. Benzigersaid : " Let 's have dinner , now . No more drinking , and I do n't want our steak ruined . " At dinner the conversation was autobiographical , biographical , and anecdotal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ den while the women sat in the livingroom and knitted . At nine-thirty Mrs. Benzigercame in to say goodnight and Natalie followed her into the room . " I might as well say goodnight , too , " said Natalie.  |p464  " Keep Mr. Eaton company for a minute , " said Benziger . He left with his wife . " Mother has a heart condition , " said Natalie . " She never stays up later than ten . " " What do you do with your time ? Or have you a heart condition , too ? " " No , I have no particular heart condition of either kind . I play bridge , go to the movies , the usual . Dances at the club . " " Will you go to the movies with me sometime ? " " No . " " Because I 'm married ? " " You guessed it . None of my friends would think of going to the movies with a married man . " " I have n't asked your friends . " " I 'm telling you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the movies with me in  --  Philadelphia ? " " No . " " Why ? Again because I 'm married ? " " Yes . I think that you probably have a very nice wife , an attractive wife . There 's no percentage for me in playing around with a married man . I never have , and I never intend to . " " Are you angry because I asked you ? " " No . I consider it a compliment . " " I hope you do , because you 're the first girl I ever asked to go out with me since I 've been married . That 's six years . But I have something more to say . " " Maybe you 'd better not say it . " " I 'll say it . I hope to go on seeing you for the rest of my life . " " I was right . You should n't have said it . " " Maybe , but you know I mean it . You knew the minute I looked at you , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage this conversation . " " In two hours  --  in two minutes  --  my whole life has been changed , just by seeing you . You do n't want me to disturb you . I want to disturbyou . Not to make you unhappy , or uncomfortable , but to convince you of this one thing . " " Do n't say it , please . " " I love you . " " You still should n't have said it . I could have thought it and you could have let me think it , but you should n't have said it . " " I 'm going to be here for two months . Even if I do n't ever say it again , or get the chance to , I have said it and it 's true . " " I think I 'd better go away . " " You 're not going to give it a chance ? " " Give what a chance ? What has a chance ? You have a wife and two children . " " And a very important job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's more than most people get out of life . " She looked up at him . " It 's more than I have , and what you 're doing now is spoiling any chance I have of getting it . " " Yes , you 're right . 1 had n't looked at it that way . Before your father comes back , will you meet me sometime , to talk ? Will you phone me at the hotel ? " " No. 1 know that if we stop it now it wo n't get worse . " " Then you felt it too ? " " Of course I did . This does n't happen to just one person . " " I 'd have loved you if it had n't happened to you . " " How old are you ? " " I 'm thirty . " " And you do n't know the first thing about love . . . And then we stayed in Paris for three weeks and then we went to London for a week . Is Mother all right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Few things I wanted to tell her . I wo n't be seeing her in the morning . Dewey 's coming for me at five minutes of seven . " " Well , I 'll wander along , Mr. Benziger . " " Now wait . Natalie 's having some people in for dinner on Saturday and Mrs. Benziger and I think it 'd be nice if you came , too ! " " They had a pow-wow to decide whether it was all right to invite a married man . Yes , Dad ? " " Well , something on that order . This is n't New York , and I 'm sure Mr. Eaton realizes it . You know how small towns are . But a dinner party in our own house , with Mother here , that changes the complexion of it . And I 'm sure it 's all right with the real hostess , Natalie ? " " Yes , of course , " said Natalie . " Fine . Good . You understand why Natalie did n't invite you herself . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But it 's so much closer to Philadelphia than we are , we tend to think of towns down that way as part of the city . " " Well , we never did . Do the men dress on Saturday ? " " No . It is n't a big party . It 's really only two tables of bridge . " " Then I 'm excess baggage . Let me have a rain check for Saturday and invite me some other time . " " Dad , I think that would be better . We keep the scores individually for the whole season , so I 'm afraid Mr. Eaton would n't have much fun just talking to dummy . " " Well , you two work that out yourselves . But Mrs. Benziger and I hope you 'll come here for dinner , if not this Saturday , some other time . Natalie , will you lock up ? Goodnight , Mr. Eaton . " " Thank you for everything , you and Mrs. Benziger , and have a good trip . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go to Pittsburgh I alwaysfeel that I 'm getting the Middle Western point of view . Goodnight . "  |p466His  failure to kiss his daughter indicated that he expected to see her momentarily upstairs , and Alfred put on his coat and went to the door . She went out to the porch with him , and let out the dog . " Innocent , are n't they ? " said Natalie . " The last thing they 'd ever want to do is throw us together , but they almost did . " " You 're bucking fate , Natalie . That 's dangerous . " " Not as dangerous as some things . Goodnight , Mr. Eaton . " He clasped her hand for a moment , but she shook her head slowly . " I would n't have minded kissing you if you had n't said what you said . I would have liked it , a casual kiss from an attractive man . But now it would be misinterpreted . " " I can wait forever . " " That 's what it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back . " She whistled , one long low note and one short high note , and the dog , out of the darkness , was upon them in seconds . " That 's my answer ? " said Alfred , laughing . " That 's your answer . " She opened the door and she and the dog went inside and he heard the bolt being shot . As he slammed the door of his car the porch light went out . The car did not start easily , and he soon became conscious of the cold . His topcoat was light , his gloves were thin . The car was a Chevroletbusiness coupe , unheated , and he drove with the disturbing knowledge that there was water and not alcohol in the radiator . But he enjoyed the ride and when he got to the hotel he had a cup of coffee in the coffee shop , which was decorated in a simulation of the interior of a mine , and he was thankful for the warmth of his room and for his solitude . He had decided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , which two months hence he would use in preparing his report to the firm . He got out his notebook and wrote " R. W. B. " at the top of the page . From the beginning everything he wrote , and the unwritten thinking that produced his impressionistic notes , proved the inadequacy of Hasbrouck'sinformation on Ralph Benziger . Nowhere would Hasbrouck have considered it valuable to have a record of most of what Alfred had observed about Benziger . Benziger had the eye of the poet without the poet 's constricted tongue , but what was Hasbrouck 's picture of Benziger ? A hard-working man who had the good will of the people who worked for him . If there was more , it was only more of the same , and the sameness could have been repeated for a thousand , ten thousand , men who employed labor . Hasbrouck 's information was inaccurate because of its incompleteness , but Hasbrouck could not be expected to know that . Hasbrouck was a snob , the worst kind of Wall Street snob , who would excuse his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was undesirable in a business relationship to take the time and trouble to understand any more about him than that he wasp467efficient , industrious , sober , and honest . The cold truth was that Hasbrouckdid not want to understand a man like Benziger , who had no Harvard or Yale background ( Hasbrouck considered Princeton an institutionwhich some of his prep school friends attended because of family ties , but was at best a member of the Big Two-and-a-Half ) . Hasbrouck would describe as virtues some of MacHardie 's characteristicsthat in Benziger he would dismiss as ordinary . Hasbrouck couldnever get Benziger to open up as he had tonight in his nearly lyrical description of his mountains and his people . Benziger would know in two minutes that Hasbrouck would never see the faces of the men lined up at a shaft but only that they represented certain items on the time-sheets that had to compare favorably with the tonnage figures . But Alfred had found out that Benziger was a man who knew what he was doing and why he was doing it , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes it would have taken him to judge Hasbrouck , had judged Alfred and opened up to him . It was a complimentaryjudgment , to be sure , but it resulted in a more accurate picture of Benziger than Hasbrouck would ever get , and therefore was even more valuable for its results than any set of facts respectfully submitted to Hasbrouck . Alfred was pleased by the compliment , but he was equally pleased by this additional confirmation of his own judgment of Hasbrouck , whom he did not like . Whenever he was called to Hasbrouck 's desk he would come away with the conviction that of all nine desks , Hasbrouck'swas most likely to become his own . Whether Hasbrouck suspected him of such ambitions he could not tell . Hasbrouck was always so precise in his praise and so careful not to patronize him thathe gave Alfred no reason to complain or resent . He did not underestimate Hasbrouck , who worked hard , was shrewd in his work , and was re-spectedand even feared in and out of the firm . It was said of him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tying an ascot for you , and he 'd tie a damn good ascot , too . " But he was an arithmetician , not a mathematician ; he was a snob , and he lacked what old Raymond Johnson liked to see in a business man  --  imagination . Both characteristics would work against him in an appraisal of R. W. Benziger , the business at hand , as the lack of imagination had somewhat worked against him in the Louisiana sulphur proposition . . . It had been one of Alfred 's first important assignments , and one in which he was expected to function as a student in the MacHardie trainingcourse that was not a training course . He went along as a clerk , messenger , and in a perfectly self-respecting way as valet to Hasbrouck . As he left New York he was totally ignorant of the uses of sulphur and he arrived in New Orleans with only a sketchy , general idea of its value . In the next few weeks he absorbed more information , but still only what he could pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chat with when Hasbrouck was not giving him clerical and messenger chores . He was amused by the fact that the oil industryp468had to go to a lot of trouble to remove the sulphur from crude oil , and then put sulphur back in , a fact which he learned was also true of steel and the manufacture of certain kinds of steel , and which explained the carloads of sulphur he remembered lying at the north end of his father 's mill . The usefulness of sulphur in the oil and steel industries was what concerned MacHardie &; Company , since the firm was the heaviest stockholder in Cullingworth Steel and Ziegler Oil , the latter an East Texas company which was being used to justify Hasbrouck 's presence in Louisiana . They had been in the state about two weeks , and one night after dining alone , Alfred was sitting in the hotel lobby . A thin , carelessly dressed man with an untrimmed moustache took the chair beside him . " Cigar ? " said the man . " Smoking , thanks , " said Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice piece of change ? " " How would I go about doing that ? " said Alfred . " Well , it would cost you money , all things do in the long run , all things that a man can buy . A woman like that there , she would n't have to pay money . " " I noticed her . She a friend of yours ? " " No sir , she is not . I 'm past the age where I get in the saddle any more , but I still look , from habit . Clutch that little bottom of hers and hang on , twenty years ago . " " Well , somebody 's going to be hanging on tonight . She just made a pick-up . " " Well , let 's hope he do n't wake up with a bead on it some morning next week . The bead that wo n't shake off . Oh , that old bead . At least I do n't have that to worry about no more . You never caught it . " " Nope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberty of sizing you up right . " " That 's all it was . Luck . " " Do n't go low-ratin ' luck , mister . This may be your lucky night . " " You never can tell . " " She may be thin and look all in , but you never can tell . ' No sir , you never can . But you can make a nice piece of change if you believe in luck . " " I can ? " " Provided you believe it was lucky you saw old Jack Rawlings tonight . " " Jack Rawlings being you ? " " None other . " " Yes , I do believe I was lucky , Mr. Rawlings . But now I think my luck is about to run out , because I 'm headed for bed . Up early , you know . " " Hasbrouck works you pretty hard , does he ? " " Yes , but how did you know that ? Not that it 's any secret , " said Alfred.  |p469  " I 've lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always take a look at the registry every morning . " " One of the owners ? " " Not any more . Used to own a few shares , but they bought me out a while back . Not that you have to answer me if you are n't so inclined , but are you down here to buy up some oil properties ? " " You said if I was n't so inclined  --  " " You did n't have to answer me . Well , you ca n't shoot a man for asking . Just curiosity , an old man sticking his nose in where it do n't belong . But when I see a partner of James D. MacHardie in town , well I knowed right away it was something bigger'n crabbing . Only two things in Louisiana big enough to interest James D. MacHardie , and I already asked you about the one . If I asked you about the other I 'd get the same answer . " " What is the other , Mr. Rawlings ? " " It would n't be sulphur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed , sir . Goodnight . " " Pretty good . You 're smarter'n I took you for . " Hasbrouck went out to dinner every night , and Alfred would chat with Rawlings in the lobby . He reported that the old man had identified Hasbrouck , but Hasbrouck seemed unconcerned and accepted the recognitionas his due . One evening when Rawlings did not show up Alfred inquired for him and the next evening Rawlings mentioned the fact . " If I was to just die in my sleep nobody 'd miss me . That is , I thought so , but I 'm reliably informed you asked after my health last evening . " " Yes , I did . I 'm glad to see you 're all right again . " " Thank you , sir . I stood in water and muck all my life and now I 'm paying for it with the rheumatism . " " Have you lived here all your life ? " " In Louisiana ? No , but a big piece of it . Last year I went pretty near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this year my rheumatism bothers me . Next year it 'll be something else and the year after that all my worries 'll be over . But it was right nice of you to ask after me . " " Well , I enjoy our evenings together . " " I do n't mind telling you I do too , sir . I 'll be sorry to see you go . " " So will I , although I have to admit it 's only because of our chats . My wife is coming down next week for a few days . You 'll have to meet her . " " I can give her a good report on her husband . " " She knows I behave . I do n't want to misbehave , that 's why . " " Mr. Eaton , that first offer I made you to make a little money for yourself ? " " Yes . " " You would n't of made any money . I was hoping to get rid of some land I own . There 's no oil underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got $25,000 , or could you lay your hands on it ? " " Mr. Rawlings , I do n't want to buy anything . " " Yes you do . You 're out to make money , that 's why you 're with James D. MacHardie . " " I 'd rather remember you as a pleasant gentleman I spent some pleasantevenings with . I do n't want to think of you as a man who took me for a sucker , so let 's steer clear of business and tell me about the old days . " " Oh , I 've made some deals that do n't make me proud of myself in my old age , but I 'd never cheat a young fellow that 's been nice to me . Have you got $25,000 ? " " Yes , I have . " " Then I tell you what to do with it . Your Hasbrouck man , he 's fixing to buy up the St. Bovard Parish Sulphur Company . You do n't have to say yes or no . I know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelve . I know . Both those deals have been shaken hands on and ready to sign . But next door to the Beau Reve is a thousand acres of swamp , that 's all it is and nobody 's interested in it . They had surveyorson it , they sold options on it , they had geologists give their opinions . Nothing there but trap-lines now . Well , Mr. Eaton , you can option that land for $25,000 , twenty-five dollars an acre . You do it . " " I 'm just a clerk , Mr. Rawlings . " " You 're a clerk with $25,000 , though . Hasbrouck wo n't buy it and I do n't care what Hasbrouck does . You option it for yourself and that lovely wife and son of yours that you showed me the pictures of . And then you tell James D. MacHardie to go plumb to hell . " " Why do you want to sell it ? " " That 's a natural question . I ca n't sell it because I do n't own it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you have $25,000 . " " I have a little more than that , but I do n't have any wife or young ones to leave my money to , and I 'm too full of the rheumatism to get any pleasure out of work . I 'm an old man living alone in a hotel , that 's all I am , waiting for somebody to claim the body , and that 's going to be an undertaker I hired three years ago . Here they do n't even put you in the ground , so I 'm getting cremated and my ashes sprinkled on Lake Pontchartrain , if the undertaker remembers to take the trouble . " " Well , at least you can laugh at it . If I did want to take an option on this land who would I talk to ? " " I 'll write down their names for you . And my lawyer , a man named Xavier O'Ryan . Let him do the buying for you . " At lunch the next day Alfred told Hasbrouck the old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Naturally we 're not interested , " said Hasbrouck . " But you seem to be . " " I do n't know whether I am or not , Mr. Hasbrouck . " " Well , can you afford to pay $25,000 more for your education ? "  |p471  " No , but would you have any objection if I did ? Would the firm object ? " " Not if you made sure the firm was kept entirely out of it . Sometimesthe best thing that can happen to a young chap is to lose money early in his career . However , I must warn you that if you do decide to do it , it goes down on your record at the office . Your work has been satisfactory and I 'm going to say so in my report , but I 'm also obliged to report this , too . If you do it . Just as I will report that you did n't do it if you follow my advice . The St. Bovard and Beau Reve are investments . The other land is worthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fur business . I understand the trappers make a good living , some years . But you 'd have to go a lot deeper than the Frasch process goes if you expect to get any sulphur out of that land , and as to oil . . . " Hasbrouck 's smiling superiority became so infuriating that Alfred could answer it only by taking the old man 's advice in defiance of Hasbrouck . He went to his room and telephoned Ed Barlow in Port Johnson , instructing him to telegraph $20,000 that same afternoon . The Postal Telegraph notice was in Alfred 's mail-box when he returned to the hotel before dinner , and he immediately paid a call on Xavier O'Ryan . O'Ryan , a short man with thick black eyebrows and a shock of white hair , was not surprised to see him , and said so . " You realize , Mr. Eaton , this-yuh ai nt a speculation . It 's a gaimble , a gaimble pure and simple , " said O'Ryan . " Otherwise I 'd sure be in it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But you 're doing it because you like Jack Rawlings . " " I guess that 's what it comes down to . " " Ve ' well , sir . I foresee no difficulties . Your money order will be deposited when the bank opens in the morning , and this is your personal cheque for the remainder . Am I to understand that I 'm to have the honor of acting for you in a legal capacity after you go North ? There 'll be such matters as taxes , collecting rents and so on . The one wo n't balance the other , you know that . " It was obvious that Rawlings had instructed O'Ryan to treat Alfred with every consideration , and back at the hotel Alfred waited for Rawlingsin anticipation of the pleasure the transaction would give the old man . But Rawlings did not appear that night , and the next morning the elevator boy told him why . Rawlings had died during the night . Hasbrouck permitted Alfred to go to the funeral in the small Episcopalchurch . The service was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes of the elevator boy  --  bellboy class , and a few elderly women who had survived the rigors of their past . O'Ryan spoke to him after the service . " I just wanted to tell you , since there 's no money changed hands yet , and Jack passing away , you do n't have to go through with the deail . I mean to say , he 's past taking offense if you druther not . "  |p472  " I 'll go through with it , as planned , Mr. O'Ryan . " O'Ryan looked at him . " He was right about you . He said you were a gentleman , " said O'Ryan , and Alfred knew that he had a new friend . About three months after their work in Louisiana was completed Hasbrouck sent for Alfred . " I 'm not going to beat about the bush , " said Hasbrouck . " How much do you want for your options on that Louisiana land ? " " I do n't know . You must know something I do n't know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I have a sneaking suspicion he wants me to eat crow , and I 'm prepared to do that . I was wrong , and you were right . There 's oil . How much , we do n't yet know . Now you can raise the money to finance additional investigationyourself , if you like . Or you can sell us your options at a considerableprofit and we 'll develop the property if there 's anything there . " " If there 's anything there ? " " There 's oil there , but we do n't know that it 's one of the great pools , or just one of those freaks . And I have been asked to tell you that your decision in no way affects your job here . That 's up to you . " " Will you give me some time to think about it ? " " Take a week , if you like . Go down to Louisiana and find out what you can . This firm will be here when you get back . " " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Alfred . He watched Hasbrouck 's effort to retain his composure , turning a long gold pencil over and over , running his fingers down the pencil to the bottom , then up-ending it and starting again at the top . Hasbrouck had well-manicured hands and his cuffs were starched , and hands and cuffs became symbols of the man in the present situation : whatever was going on inside him , he was not showing it . He had spoken of eating crow , but he had displayed no humility or even respect , and yet Alfred sensed that if he gave an answer that was unsatisfactory to the firm , Hasbrouck would resign . Months might pass , but only to enable Hasbrouck , and indirectly the firm itself , to save face . " All right , Mr. Hasbrouck , " said Alfred . " I 've decided . I 'll sell the options for $250,000 and one condition . " " What is the condition ? " " That the first well you bring in be called the Jack Rawlings . " " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options  --  us will be a company we 'll form , of course  --  for $250,000 . That ends your participation in the deal ? " " Yes . That , and the naming of the first well . " " That 's satisfactory . Congratulations . I think you showed great good sense . You did n't ask for too much money , you did n't gamble $250,000 , which is what you 'd have been doing , you know . And you did nothing , I may say , to jeopardize your position with the firm . I 'll tell you now that you made a very good guess . If you had asked for more than three hundred thousand , you would n't have got it . And regardless of ourp473good intentions and our sincerity , I do n't think you 'd have been very happy here . Now tell me , please , why did you decide to risk $25,000 of your own money for those options ? Do you know why ? " " I think I do . The old man trusted me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trust him , but he trusted me . I 'm almost sure to lose by it sometime , but I 'd rather lose by it than hurt somebody who did trust me . Hard to explain . " " Well , we 'll see that his name is perpetuated , or at least that 's what we hope . " " Now I 'd like to ask a question if I may . How do you know there 's oil on that property ? " " You may ask , but I 'm not at liberty to tell you . I am at liberty to tell you one thing you may have overlooked . If you 'll read your contract with the firm , re-read it , you 'll notice that there 's a clause in it that covers just such situations as this . Technically , under your contract , you had to sell us that property , and we did n't have to pay you a cent more than $25,000 . " " I knew that , Mr. Hasbrouck . " " Oh , you did , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect in Hasbrouck 's smile , and that much respect remained there permanently . . . . Alfred finished his notes on R. W. Benziger and put them in a folder . He was amused by the workings of his own conscience : the complimentary jottings about Benziger had made up for the deception he was practicing . And yet he was sure that if Benziger ever discovered that he was not actually a bond salesman for Rowley &; Cruickshank , it was a deception that Benziger would forgive . And he realized that Benziger 's forgiveness , Benziger 's approval , had in a few hours become as important to him as the approval he had never got from his father but had been given by his grandfather , Fritz Thornton , Lex , and even Jack Rawlings . It was strange , he remarked to himself . that he had not automatically included James D. MacHardie in that list , but then not so strange ; James D. MacHardie was scarcely more of a human being than J. P. Morgan &; Company , the Pennsylvania Railroad , the PennsylvaniaCompany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Insurance of Houses for Loss by Fire , the Girard Trust Company , E. I. du Pont de Nemours , or any other business organization which had been a name to Alfred since he first learned to read . Often months would go by without his seeing James D. MacHardie , and even when he saw him it was no more than that ; MacHardie in his wing collar and slightly squared derby hat , marching splendidly alone on the Axminster runner with his silvermountedcane , on his way to his car ; carefully looking downward and forward a few paces but speaking to no one ( except the white-haired guard at the door ) and fully confident that no one would get in his way . Alfred did not resent the augustness of MacHardie , but neither did he yield up any affection for the senior partner . But his feeling for R. W.p474Benziger was already that of warmth and eagerness for Benziger 's approval  --  afeeling he was beginning to recognize as traceable to the lack of it in his relationship with his father . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sought he had not included the name of Eugene St. John , and he thought about the omission for a long time . Yesterday , and at any time in the past five years that he had made such a list , he would have had Mr. St. John 's name among the first . Now he had not thought of him at all , and he knew what that meant , not in reference to St. John , but as it implied the state of his relationship with Mary . He knew then that the things he had said to Natalie were true . He knew more than that ; he knew that nothing he had ever felt for any other woman would help him now . The easy comparisons were with Victoria and Mary , but Victoria had become a romantic wound , and Mary was an accomplishment , a capture , and then in their marriage privately a sharer of passion and affection , publiclyan adjunct in the life he had chosen to lead . There was not a minute 's worth of future for him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel room , he would not argue with the realities or his conscience , the proper loyalties , the responsibilities to his sons , the responsibilitiesto the career he was so firmly building . He conceded all the arguments but one : he had seen Natalie , he had met her , and what he had said he had had to say because to leave it unsaid was a concession not to those other arguments , but to self-doubt and insincerity . He had been faithful to Mary in word and in deed , and he was reconciled to the continuation of their relationship as it stood ; and if it stood . But whatever might happen , he had not treated what he felt for Natalie with the disrespect of polite conversation or silence . If he never saw her again , the good had been done . She would know for the rest of her long life that the sight of her had once created love , that it was a love that dispelled doubt before it arose , that it had been declared , and that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her tonight ; that was his first concessionto the realities . But if this were to be his last night on earth , he would spend it with her . And always it would be that way , whatever happened , whatever did not happen . It was almost a fact now that he could not live with her , but he wanted to be with her at the end of his life . And now the telephone rang . " Hello , " he said . " You got home all right , " she said . " I was thinking about you this very second . Have you a telephone in your room ? " " No , I came downstairs . I 'm in that little room . I went to bed but I could n't sleep . Can you hear me all right ? I do n't dare speak louder . " " You 've thought about what I said . " " Yes , that 's why I called you . I wanted to tell you  --  I 'm glad you said it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having said it . "  |p475  " I know . I 'm writing you a letter . Goodnight  --  my love . " She hung up , and he turned out his light and lay there , hearing an occasional automobile and with some regularity the starting and stopping of the trolley cars and on every half-hour the bell of the court-house clock . He wanted to stay awake and retain a consciousness of this tranquillity , these last moments before there was passion in their love and the rest of the world came back into their lives . In the morning he awoke refreshed and cheerful without immediately knowing why , but he soon remembered . It was a good idea to keep busy and after breakfast he paid three calls on two business men and a doctor who were on the Rowley &; Cruickshank list . After lunch he drove to the country club and was surprised to see a large number of automobiles in the parking area , but on his way to the golf shop he saw the reason : ten tables of ladies ' bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving me a guest card but I know it has n't arrived . Is it all right if I hit a few ? " " R. W. Benziger ? Sure . I 'll get you a match if you can wait till three o'clock . You paying your own greens fees or is Mr. Benziger ? " " I 'm paying them myself . " " Three dollars a day . Caddy fee , if you want a caddy , two bits for nine holes , for second-class caddies , and thirty-five cents for first-class . But you wo n't get any kind till after three , school leaves out then . You 'll want a locker . I 'll take you over and meet Otto and he 'll take care of you . " Alfred changed to knickers and sweater and returned to the golf shop . " Just put your name and address and home club in this book and when Mr. Benziger 's card comes I 'll sign you in officially . You were n't expecting Mr. Benziger ? " " He went to Pittsburgh today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just testing me out ? " " Well , it 's nothing against you , and do n't hold it against me . The only trouble we have is like two years ago a nice-looking fellow said he was a friend of one of our members . Member happened to be in Europe at the time , and this stranger , he had a Packard car and he looked all right . But he hung around here for a week and finally he took over $800 from one member and four hundred from another and around four hundred from another . He 'd been playing this course in the middle forties but boy , when he started bearing down he came in with a 68 for the eighteen , that 's when he got the eight hundred , and in the low seventies the other two times . The best eighteen I ever put together was a 67 and I play this course every day it do n't snow . After that the greens committee tightened up on guest cards . " " Well , I do n't want to get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You knew Mr. Benziger was gon na be in Pittsburgh . " " And you could call Mrs. Benziger . I had dinner there last night . " " No , that 's all right . But no matter whose guest you are , I advisep476you , do n't you be the one to offer to play for any important money . They 'll call the state cops . Mr. English will be here at three o'clock , if you want to wait for him . He has an automobile agency and he can play any time he feels like it . About your age , maybe a little younger . Plays a nice game when he 's on his game , but he can go haywire worse than anybody I ever saw . There he is now . Hey , Mr. English , I was just talking about you . " The newcomer nodded to Alfred . " Yeah , " he said to the pro . " I 'll bet you were . Is my mashie-niblick ready ? " " No . I said I 'd have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping you 'd have it today . Is Mickey going to be here this afternoon ? " " If he is n't kept after school . " " Then how about Smiley ? " " Smiley ought to be here . Uh , make you acquainted with Mr. Eaton . Mr. Eaton , this is Mr. English . " " Glad to know you , " said English . " Glad to know you , " said Alfred . English hesitated . " Have n't we met before ? Are you from anywhere around here ? " " Originally from Port Johnson . " " No , unless I met you here . Your family used to own the steel mill down there ? " " Yes , " said Alfred . " I 've been here once before , for about five minutes one night . Oh , a long time ago . " " Maybe I met you then , or maybe I 'm all wrong . " " I did n't meet anybody then . Oh , now wait a minute . Did you go to Lehigh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember . You went to Princeton . Right ? You drove a Marmon . A grey Marmon with the top down ? " " That 's me . We stood up there on the porch and watched the people dancing . " " Freezing our balls off , as I remember . What are you doing in these parts ? Are you going to live here ? " " No . Trying to sell some bonds . " " Where 's your stiff collar ? " " I did n't wear it today . " " You 'll be drummed out of the regiment if they ever hear about it . Have you got a match all set ? If not , I 'm playing alone and 1 'd be glad if you 'd join me . " They played nine holes before dark and in the locker-room English supplied the gin for their ginger-ale highballs , and signed the chit for the ginger ale . " I have to scat , " said English . " Having dinner at my mother-in-law 's . But I 'll call you at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to do . " At the hotel there was a special-delivery letter in his box.  |p477I  have to call you that because I do not know your first name . I wonder what it is ? I have gone through all the names I could think of , starting with Abner and ending with Zebulon . I hope it 's neither because I am not fond of either name . I do n't know anyone named Abner and Zebulon is a name I only remember from geography  --  Pike 's Peak . But what difference does it make ? My father and my brother are both named Ralph and yet it is not a name I would choose . Is your name Ulysses ? Percival ? Malcolm ? Those are other names I do not like , and yet if it turns out that one of those is your name , I shall begin to like it immediately because it is your name . After you left our house I locked up all around and then climbed the stairs to say goodnight to my mother and father . They said complimentarythings about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known the gist of our conversation in the den ) . They asked me my opinionand I , too , joined in the chorus of praise , but I was not sincere . If I had expressed the disapproval I felt , they might have wondered why , and it would have been impossible to tell them since I did not know why myself . Then I took a bath and tumbled into bed , but not to sleep . I soon realized the reason for my sleeplessness . I was still startled by what you said , but soon I realized that I was believing your words and that was even more startling . That was when I called you up . I guess I wanted you to reassure me , or perhaps I merely wanted to hear your voice . Nothing like this has ever happened to me . I have been in and out of love several times , of course , and was half engaged last summer but it collapsed because the boy had no intention of settling down . He was from Pittsburgh and had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrimony was to take a world cruise for a year , after which we would live in Sewickley ( near Pittsburgh ) and Southampton and also have an apartment in New York . I could not help but compare him with My father and picture our marriage ten years from now and realized that marriage to him was impossible , much as I liked him . I do not wish to masquerade under false pretenses . I enjoy a good time . But he lived in another world , totally different from mine or from the kind of world I want to live in . And yet if you were to ask me what kind of world I prefer , I should have difficulty in answering . Why do I ramble on like this ? Is it because I do not want to say goodnightto you ? This will be a long night for me but a happy one . I could not say this over the phone , but I can say it now . I love you , too . My mind is in a whirl and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should say , such as to tell you that we must not see each other again and all the other sensible things that have always meant so much to me and still do . I have never kissed a married man and of course I have not kissed you , and yet I wanted to so much that it might have been better if I had . If I had kissed you and let you kiss me , perhaps I would be able to sayp478now that " he just wanted to kiss me . " Then I would be able to forget you as easily as I have some boys I kissed . As things are , I shall never forget you . Whether or not we ever see each other again , some day when I am fifty and perhaps a grandmother , I shall always remember that one night in October 1927 I met a handsome man who told me he loved me and I believed him without even knowing his first name . Dear Man , please stay away . But that is not my heart speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be better to keep what we have this minute instead of the pain and sorrow that we will cause not only to ourselves but to those who love us ? But it is not for you to decide , it is for me . What that will be I can not tell . Tonight I love you , but tomorrow I may love you more . If I mail this you will know which way I have decided . If I had to decide now there would be no doubt . NatalieHe tried to visualize her as she had been during the writing of the letter . He re-read it many times , wholly and in parts , to try to reconstructthe thinking that resulted in the written sentences . He wondered how long it had taken her to write the letter , and at what hour of the morning she had taken it to the post office . It was a special delivery , but instead of a special stamp the envelope had five two-cent stamps , and the postmark told him only that it had been canceled before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He was surprised to find himself in an unreasonably angry mood , as though he were imprisoned in his hotel room and she the belle of some forbidden ball . Yes , it had come to that . She was as far away as the telephone  --  but so was he . And the girl who had written that letter would call when she could . He went to a movie because one of the stars in it was Greta Garbo , but it was an unfortunate choice in the circumstances of his new romance . The title was Flesh and the Devil , but the story was still Anna Karenina , and Alfred was not receptive to the idea of the tragic aspects of illicit love . He knew what they were , he had been thinking about them , he did not need to be told . He did not stay to see the beginning . He was making his daily report when the telephone rang . " Hello , " he said . " What is your first name ? " she said . " Abner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where are you ? I loved your letter , and I love you . " " I love you , and I guess I 'll never have a letter to love . " " You may . Where are you ? " " Home . Mother 's gone to bed , but I ca n't talk long . Please tell me your first name ? " " My real first name is Raymond , but I never use it . The name I use is my middle name , Alfred . Hardly anybody knows about the Raymond . " " May I call you Raymond ? It would be appropriate . " " Why ? "  |p479  " I 'll use your secret name for our secret love affair . Have you ever had a special delivery addressed to just Mr. Eaton ? On blue stationery ? " " No , I have n't . " " What did you do today ? Work ? " " And played golf at your club with a fellow named English . " " Julian . He 's nice . I could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to , never fear . Did you mention my name at all ? " " No . " " I 'm glad you did n't , because he and his wife are coming here Saturday . The club might be a good place for me to  --  no . No . Let me think . There 's a road about a half a mile south , south of the club driveway . I could meet you on that road at three o'clock tomorrow , for a little while . It 's the only road on your right going south . I must say goodnight . Goodnight , Raymond . " He found the road easily . It was narrow and unimproved , and a farmer driving a team of mules hitched to a manure-spattered wagon stared at him , nodded and said , " Hyuh , " and passed on . Then Alfred saw a Chrysler roadster in his rear-view mirror . Natalie was driving it . She went past him , turned around and came back and parked on the other side of the road . " Hardly anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She got in his car and for a moment sat with her hands in her lap , and then he took her in his arms and they had their first kiss . Her response to the kiss was whole and trusting , with both arms around his neck , with no hand held back to fend off his hand . " Yes , " she said . " If I had any doubt , I have n't now . Is everything else going to be perfect , too ? No , of course not . We know that , do n't we , Raymond ? " " The nicest thing is that you trust me . " " I do , and you must trust me . Why do I say that ? Because  --  you 're married . I 'm a virgin . But it is n't only that I trust you . You must believe me when I tell you why we ca n't have necking parties . You 're not used to stopping , and I 've never had the other . And I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wife . " She nodded . " Not that I 'm worried about her finding out . But I do n't want to be the one that you 're unfaithful with . " " You mean you do n't want to be the first one I 'm unfaithful with ? " " No , that is n't what I mean . I 'll go the limit with you . I believe in that for us , some day . But not as long as she 's faithful to you . I would never , never while she 's faithful to you . " " I might want you enough to lie to you . " " Not to me . " " No , not to you . " " This is the beginning of our troubles , is n't it ? " " Yes , if you put it that way . "  |p480  " It is . I know . You want me , and if I ever wanted anybody I want you . Oh , how silly to say that . I do want you . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw me . " " It happened in seconds . " " Then understand this . You loved me because of what I 'm saying now . You knew that I would feel that way about your marriage . It shows , Raymond . Not that you can always tell whether a girl is a virgin or not . But the very second you loved me , you knew all the good and bad things you have to expect . " " Very wise . " " Very much in love . Thinking of nothing else . I 'll tell you something about yourself . " " What ? " " I 'll tell you several things , and I only know them because I love you . Let me think . . . First , something happened to you when you were quite young . Something sad . So sad that for a long while you were more unhappy than happy . " " Right . " " I have to think of something else now . . . You 're quite accustomed to being alone . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people as much as most people do . Maybe that has something to do with the first guess . " " Yes and no , but you 're right . " " I 'll try one more guess . And I 'm not doing this to be clever . I could n't do it with anyone else . Let me think . Yes . You like my father . Not just like , because everybody likes him . But you like my father better than  --  better than he gave you any reason to . " " Absolutely correct . " " Do you know why ? " " I could give you reasons , but they 'd all be reasons , if you know what I mean . Reasons are like excuses , sometimes . I like your father as much as any man I 've ever known , and I do n't really care what the reasons are . " " I 'm very glad , because then you 'll understand about me and the way I feel about him . I know the nasty stuff , the sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I like my father . Sex is one of the reasons I love you , Raymond . I know that . But I like my father because there is n't any of that in my feeling for him , and there is in my love for you . I 'll always love my father , but no girl can completely love her father the way I  --  yes , the way some day I 'm going to love you . " " Some day . You think there will be some day ? " " Yes . And there again I trust you . A less honorable man , but in love the way we are , might drive his wife to being unfaithful to him . You wo n't . " " No . " " No . If I were married , Raymond , and just met you , I 'd love you just as much , more than I loved my husband . But I 'd never be unfaith/ful to him while he was faithful to me . I hope that girl is as good to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be . " " No , I guess not . A wife has more on her side . What are you think-ing ? " " I ca n't say it . It 's something I believe , but do n't know , and I ca n't say it to you till I know . " " Oh , Raymond . You think she 's unfaithful to you ? " " No . I honestly do n't . " " I wo n't ask you any more . But I 'm glad she has n't been . And now what happens to us is really up to her , is n't it ? " He nodded . " And remember . You trust me . " " There 'll never be any doubt about that . " " What 's next for us ? " " Oh  --  I 'm going away . We ca n't just talk about our love . If I stayed home , some night all our good intentions would be swept away and I 'd begin to hate your wife and children , and you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , but we might even get to hate our love . Is that possible , all that ? " " Yes . " " I 'm going to be in a wedding in St. Louis the week after next but I 'm going to leave before that . I can visit a girl in Pittsburgh  --  " " That boy ? " " Oh , he is n't there . He 's at Oxford . Oxford got him on the rebound , and you can imagine what he 's learning there . No , this is a girl I went to school with . Then I can go to Chicago for a few days . " " I 'll still be here when you get back from St. Louis . " " I wo n't be back before Christmas . You 'll be gone then . " " Probably . " " Is there some club where I can write to you ? " " Racquet Club , 370 Park . Where can I write to you ? " " Nowhere . " " Is this goodbye ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You do n't know that about me , Raymond . I can wait forever , and I will . " She took his hand and pressed it against her bosom , kissed it , and quickly got out of the car . She was gone . She was gone into their indefinite future , of which five minutes now was its enormous and infinitesimal part , as much as the whole time would be , and as little as five minutes . He gave her the five minutes to get away so that he would not catch up with her in his car . As he approached the country club driveway he thought of stopping for a drink and some human companionship , but he dismissed the notion . He did not want a drink , and the kind of human companionshiphe wanted now was possible only with Lex  --  the companionship of silences in the midst of confidences unexchanged . For the present he felt as though there had been passion spent without the previous ecstasy ;  |p482something  finished but not completed ; and a loss of dignity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the first time in his thirty years he cared about nothing in the future , and was alone with a refrigerated love that was like a meat that had been frozen and packed in Chicago , for consumption God knew when , and that might spoil before it could give sustenance to anyone . She was gone , and she was going away from him , and she could do that . She was young , twenty-two , she would only have to enter a room or a city and life would start up around her beauty so that the time would pass for her and she would be stimulated and restimulated by the effect of her own personality . She had wisdom , but she knew nothing . He did not want to doubt her love , and did not doubt it , but he thought of a line from a novel he had read a year ago , a short novel by a Princeton man named F. Scott Fitzgerald : " There 're things betweenDaisy and me that you 'll never know , things that neither of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Natalie to never forget ? A kiss ? A hand clutched to her bosom ? Or would this love that was new and that had yet surprised her so little become old enough and strong enough to last ? And not only to last ; it was not something he wanted only to last , to be contemplated privately after the ball . What did she know ? What could she know in her virginal state , without havingshared the ultimate ecstasy , without having a regret that she had not shared it first with him ? A virgin belonged to no one but was possible to every man living . And then , having reached the lowest point in his miserable meditations , he called himself a liar . Where had he left all the facts of their love , so undeniable and convincing and more real than all facts outside their love ? He gave a deep sigh , and committed himself to whatever their love would bring . There was no word from Mary that night , but she telephoned him before nine o'clock in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Obviously if I had , you would n't have been there . " " That depends on what time you 'd called . I got home late , it was after three . " " No , I did n't phone you . " " You did n't care enough to . Is that it ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Is that the way it looks to you ? " " How else could it look ? Are you having a good time ? " " Well , now what the hell difference does that make to you ? You made your decision Monday , before I even met anybody here . I 've had dinner here alone every night but one , and that was Wednesday . I had dinner with R. W. Benziger and family at his house . I 've played golf once with a fellow named English . That 's my hell-raising so far , but I 'm not telling you this to show what a good boy I am . I just want you to know that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf this afternoon , and tomorrow I think I 'll go to the football game . " " Football game ? You do n't go to football games on Sunday . "  |p483  " Here you do . " " Are we going to the Princeton-Yale game ? " " No . I have to stay here . " " Is it all right if I go ? " " Oh , boy . You 'll be sitting on the Yale side , I take it . " " Yes . " " Then why ask me if it 's all right ? You do n't give a damn about my permission , and I 'm certainly not going to give my approval . Your friend would n't have asked you if you had n't told him I was going to be away then . Got any other little excursions planned before you get written up in Cholly Knickerbocker 's column ? " " I 'm not going to call you again till you decide to be polite . " " I 'd like to speak to Rowland . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as I can make out , the main purpose of this call was to announce that you 're going to the Yale game with your friend . " " Well , I said I 'd let him know tonight . " Alfred realized that that was a slip and he could sense her alarm . " Then you let him know tonight , dear . And do n't you call me any more till I decide to be polite . I 'll be calling tomorrow to speak to Rowland , but you do n't have to be polite to me . I know there 's a limit to what you can endure , cooped up there in that apartment . So long , kid . " She lay on the bed , smoking a cigarette , with a sheet covering her from the waist down . He came in , drying himself with a large Turkish towel , and sat on the edge of the bed . She sat up . " What are these marks on your back ? " she said . " Scratches and tincture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , last night . " " I did ? " " Yes . Are you sorry ? " " I 'm not sorry for last night . But I do n't like to scratch you up like that . You should n't be so  --  " " I should n't be so what ? " " I 'm trying to think of a word . You should n't prolong it . " " Should n't 1 ? I thought you liked that . " " I do . Do you ever think of the time we wasted ? " " Not any more . " " I guess I do n't either . We had to try other people first . Shall I tell you something ? " " What ? " " When we were going together I used to get this strange feeling about you . " " Well , I 'm a strange man . " " You are ? "  |p484  " Yes . I know it now , I did n't then . Oh , I guess I did know it then . But luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean queer ? " " Not in the usual sense of the word . " " Because I 'd never let another woman touch me . " " Do n't say never . " " Some have tried . " " I ' 11 bet they have . " " Why would you bet they have ? " " Because the kind of woman that would try , would know that there 's something there . " " Yes , I think you 're right . Yes , they always thought I knew more than I did . One of them got really angry . Called me a hypocrite . She said I was leading her on , and I just thought she wanted me for her husband . But she was a bad girl . She had an affair with her own brother and he killed himself . " " Oh , sure . I know them . Stay away from them . " " I did , finally . " " They 're what you might call sexual blackmailers . They use people to get other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are you strange ? Do you want to tell me ? " " I 'll let you find out . " " Are you queer , in the usual sense of the word ? " " Do n't ask any more questions , Mary . I 'll let you find out . " " Do you love me ? " " I adore you . I do n't think I can love anybody . But that 's all right . You do n't love me , and I do n't ask you to . The kind of love that you mean , I do n't believe in it . It 's really much more flattering to have someone adore you , the way I do you . Sensation is what really counts , you know . The other junk was thought up by the State . Kings . The Church . Is n't it much more intelligent for us to be like this , you wanting me , me wanting you , instead of prattling on about how much we love each other ? And swearing to love each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find someone else . I will . " " You are strange . " " Of course . That 's what brought you here Sunday night , last night , tonight . It 's what you used to feel when we were kids . Is n't it so much more intelligent to be together like this , talking sensibly and thrilling to sensation than chattering about our devotion , forever and ever ? Look at you . With some men it would have been all over by this time . You 're just beginning to feel deeply and I have n't even put a finger on you . I 'm sure you secretly think I 'm rather evil . " " A little , yes . " " Only because you 're still remembering what you learned outside this room . But after a while , weeks or months , you 'll think the same way I do . " " I wonder . "  |p485  " Naturally you wonder , dear . It 's all so new to you . You wait till I 've taught you a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read something to you . " He stood up . " No , do n't . Just make love to me . " " All right . " She was home before midnight , bringing with her two books , a translationfrom the Hindustani and another from the German , the first illustrated with line drawings . She was wondering how to break off the affair with Roper , and continued for several days to seek an excuse that would not make him contemptuous of her , but she had already been unfaithful to Alfred , not only a casual once but deliberately and willingly twice again , and after her half-hearted attempts to find a way out of the affair she began to visit Roper 's apartment almost every afternoon that he was free . Her mother , in New York for the day , remarked on how well she looked , vaguely allowing the inference that a rest from Alfred 's demands might be responsible . Mary encouraged her mother to think what she pleased , so long as it was an idea that satisfied its own curiosity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salutary effect on Alfred 's work . In the next two weeks he and Mary made no attempt at cordiality in their telephone calls , and without an outright declaration on either side , it was understood that Mary was having an affair with Roper . In those two weeks he accomplished what he had set out to do ; he had information that was sufficient for his report , and he was trying to decide whether to wait the full month or go back to New York when the decision was made for him . He was dining , as always , alone in the hotel , with the morning 's Herald Tribune folded on his table . A man stopped at the table , then moved on a couple of steps to get a better look at his face . " Alfred Eaton , I was sure it was you . I was positive . It 's Tom Rothermel . " " Well , by God . " They shook hands and Rothermel took a chair . " What are you doing here ? " said Alfred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is James D. MacHardie coming into the coal regions ? " Immediately Alfred was on his guard . " Oh , I 'm not here for James D. MacHardie . I 'm in the bond business , with Rowley &; Cruickshank . " " Oh , the last I heard you were with James D. MacHardie . Now I ca n't tell my friends I know a MacHardie partner . " " Partner ? Jesus , Tom , you promoted me awful fast . What do you do here ? " " With the Power &; Light Company . I 've been with them ever since I got out of State . " " Married and all that ? " " No , still batching it . You know the old saying , why keep a cow when milk is so cheap ? Not that I have anything against it for somep486guys , but not me . But you 're all settled down I understand . Two young ones ? " " Two sons . " " Well . Your mother and sisters all well ? " " Fine , thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did n't you start up an aviation company with him ? " " It did n't last . " " Well , you gave Larry Von Elm his start . He 's going great guns , I hear . " " Yes , so I hear . " " I guess aviation will be the new thing now , since Lindbergh . " " Looks that way . But I 've had all the manufacturing experience I 'll ever want . I 'd rather sell bonds . " " A capitalist . " " Hmm ? " " Nothing . " " You said capitalist , did n't you ? " " Well , yes , I did . That 's what you are , are n't you ? " " Yes , are n't you ? " " Well , I 'm working for them . " " The way you say it , you sound as if you did n't like it . " " Well , if you were still working for MacHardie &; Company I would n't admit it , but I think the capitalistic system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smartest capitalist in Port Johnson . " " Sure , and I saw my father starve to death , and now I 'm working fora big public utility company and I see enough there to know it stinks . " " Well , I 'm afraid it 's here to stay . " " You may change your mind about that . " " Say , you 've got it pretty bad , Tom . " " Well , you just take a look around this part of the state . You 'll see enough to make you wonder , anyway . " " Why I 'd have thought you 'd approve of things around here . I 've only been here a short time , but I 've found out it 's a solid union country . " " Unions run by Irish Catholics . They 're not going to change any-thing . " " I was under the impression they had . In fact , I 've been given to understand that they damn near wrecked the coal business , that strike they had two years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Other people , too . " " Not the people they tried to starve into submission . Those people do n't buy bonds . This place is through , and the reason why it 's through is because the operators tried to break the union , and while they were doing it , they lost their market . " " I 've heard some of that , put in a different way . "  |p487  " I 'm giving you the facts . But hell , I do n't expect you to see it any other way . Your father was Samuel Eaton , and he was no friend of organized labor . " " No , he certainly was n't . So here we are , on opposite sides of the fence . But you 're working for a public utility . You ought to be working for a union . " " Well , maybe I am . I do n't expect to last long where I am . They 've started to look at me funny . Company spies everywhere . " " What 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's the worst enemy labor has around here . He softsoapsthem and they fall for it . Mountain City is supposed to be a model company but the men would be a darn sight better off if Benziger cracked their skulls and maybe beat a little daylight into them . That 's the trouble with the men . A few pennies , a few safety precautions , then they go back to work . " " What do you want them to do ? Take over ? " " That will come . " " Tom , I do n't recognize you any more . " " No . Your kind of people think I ought to stay Tom Rothermel , the errand boy . Child labor . Working three hours before school and five hours after . That was my eight-hour day when I was twelve years old . " " So you think this section is through . " " I know it is . It 'll take a little time . " " Before the miners take over the mines ? " " That 's only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits he closed down and threw a thousand men out of work . " " The whole steel business was shot to hell then . " " You mean a few Wall Street men stopped making big profits . If things were run right a few men would n't be able to deprive the working-manof a living . " " Oh , well , you just want socialism . " " That 's all . " " Instead of Samuel Eaton running things , you 'd rather have Tom Rothermel . " " Much rather . " " Well , are you getting anywhere ? " " Laugh at me if you want to , Alfred . " " I do n't want to laugh at you , but I think your ideas are pretty damned foolish . What I do n't see is why you are n't more interested in getting rich . When you were a kid you made money every chance you got , and I remember my grandfather saying you 'd be a rich man . " " I am a rich man , for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's inconsistent . Well , it is n't . If I have brains enough to make money out of you people , why should n't I ? But I want more than money . I do n't want a God damn yacht , polo ponies . I can skip all that stuff . " " I think you want the same thing James D. MacHardie wants . He'sp488had several yachts . No polo ponies , but several yachts . But you make the mistake of thinking that was all he wanted . It was n't . He wants power , and he has it . You want it too . If you think he 's bad , you 're just as bad as he is . " " What do you want ? " " Now I want a piece of cherry pie . Ten years from now , when you and I are forty , I want to have $3,000,000 tucked away so I can forget about it . Twenty years from now I 'd like to be one of the four or five biggest capitalists in Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union men . Unless of course you start to make really big money in the market . I wish I knew how much you 've made for yourself . " " I 'll tell you . At four o'clock this afternoon , a little over $38,000 . " " You 're a margin player , of course . " " How else would I get up to $38,000 ? And I 've made some selling short , too , you know . When they fire me at the P. &; L. I can tell them to kiss my ass . " " Why do n't you tell them to kiss your ass anyway , and quit ? " " Why should I ? They 're paying me two hundred a month , and I 'm learning all about how a big public utility is run . I 'm not husky enough to fight the company police . When I get in the labor movement I 'll have something besides a pair of fists to offer . " " Can I sell you some nice safe bonds ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No money , and no fun . How much are you worth , Alfred ? " " Tom , that 's exactly none of your God damn business . " " I just do n't understand why you 're selling bonds . A guy that was with James D. MacHardie . You inherited money from your old man and your grandfather , and I understand your wife has plenty . " " I 'm like you . Learning all about Wall Street . And I meet a lot of interesting people . " " Yeah . R. W. Benziger . " " I think he 's a swell guy . Well , Tom , would you like to go and drink some beer ? " " Where ? At the Gibbsville Club ? " " No , I have n't been there . I 've been going to an old-fashioned saloon . One block north and turn to your right . " " Murphy 's . No thanks . I have a date with a telephone operator , gets off at ten o'clock . " " Does she believe in free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far . The price of a condrum . She does it because she likes it . I give her a little hump about once a week . I sneak her into my room and as long as we do n't make too much noise the landlady does n't mind . She has to be out of there by twelve o'clock , but that 's all right . I take her home in my car , sometimes I give her another little hump on the way home , but it 's getting pretty cold for that now . I have this little Ford coop , but it 's cold here at night . "  |p489  " Stop talking about it . I do n't give a damn about your tail . " " I guess you get yours from the country club crowd . " " Nope . " " Well , you would n't say so even if you did . " " You 're right . I would n't . " Rothermel stood up with Alfred . " All I told you tonight is private , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , they probably know all about you anyway , " said Alfred . " Company spies . By the way , what were you doing here tonight ? This is a sort of a capitalist hotel , is n't it ? " " Oh , I like to put on the dog now and then , " said Rothermel . " I 'm on the committee for the Penn State dance at Christmas . We got a free meal out of the hotel tonight , the members of the committee . Honest graft . If you 're gon na be here Christmas that 's the night to get laid . We all rent rooms . " " Sorry I wo n't be here . So long , Tom . " " So long , Alfred . Funny world , huh ? " " Pretty funny . " Instead of going to the old-fashioned saloon Alfred went to his room and wrote a note to Hasbrouck . My work here is completed and I am firmly convinced that my further presence in the neighborhood would serve no useful purpose . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shall spend the weekendat my mother 's house in Port Johnson , arriving in the office Monday morning . My report should be ready before the end of next week . To himself he said : " If anybody ever asks me if I 've been to Gibbsville , I can always say I have . It is a town consisting of one hotel room , situated about halfway between Mountain City , where I first saw the love of my life , and a nameless country road where I first kissed her . " Martha was not surprised to see him , not because she had knowledge of his whereabouts , but because nothing surprised her any more . She was fifty-six now , old for her age because of the fragility that was caused by her sedentary manner of living , and young for her age in that all she seemed to need was the light touch of a magic hand to smooth out the skin and she would be forty again . In her eyes were suspicion and humor and cynicism and skepticism , and the humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the suspicion , cynicism and skepticism . She had her own language now , a combination of sensible speech ail and incoherent wanderings , as though she were speaking 1927 American English with lapses into the dialect of Chaucer . He was not there to see her . He had gone there because it was a place , the only place , in which he was answerable to no one in any way . He owned the house ; his father had left it to him , no doubt in the belief that Martha was unfitto take the responsibility of it and that the girls would n't live there long . There was a new maid to do the work that Nellie and Josephine could no longer do , and Miss Trimingham had grown into the woodworkp490with the older servants . It was a house of silences that were broken only by familiar sounds at predictable moments , a Wallace Nutting house that when viewed from the road appeared to be ready for occupancy at any time a new owner chose to move in . The windowpanes glistened and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived in the house had done all they could to give it life when once again they had seen to its cleanliness . Almost no man ever entered the front door . Sally , now twenty-eight and married to Harry Van Peltz , would bring her son and daughter to pay duty calls on their grandmother , but Harry stayed away whenever he could . Constance , now twenty-six , spoke of the house as " home " but it was no more than a convenience , a place to which she could escape from Philadelphia weekends while her married lover put in his appearance at The Rabbit parties and golf at Gulph Mills . His sisters came to the house separately while Alfred was there . " Is there anything wrong between you and Mary ? " said Sally . " Yes . " " Permanently wrong ? " " I 'll be able to tell you better next week , if I decide to tell you . " " Oh , then it 's not you . It 's Mary . That 's surprising . I always thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping at conclusions . " " Still , she 's a damn good-looking girl . And you 're away a lot . That 's the trouble with New York . " " What 's the trouble with New York ? My being away a lot ? " " No . I meant that in New York if a husband is away a lot , there are thousands of other men . " In his conversation with Constance he took the offensive . " Constance , when are you going to start making some sense out of your life ? " " What is your interest in the matter ? My honor ? The family name ? Or the chaps at your clobb , old deah ? " " All those , and I always liked you . " " Then keep your aquiline nose out of my affairs . Or my affair , singularnumber . " " What if you got pregnant ? " " It might interest you to know that I 've been pregnant , so we 've crossed that bridge . " " Has he ever talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . " " I think so , " said Alfred . " John Coddington . " " Yes . And therefore you must know that John is n't going to push his wife down a well , and he 's not going to ask her for a divorce . " " How nice for him . " " That would be a real dig if it were n't for the fact that he 's as much in love with me as I am with him . You 're no rose , Alfred . Why are you preaching ? Has James D. MacHardie gone to your head ? " " Yes . "  |p491  " That explains a lot , even if you did mean it sarcastically . " " What does it explain ? " " Well , let me ask you a question . Is your married life so perfect that you can pass judgment on everybody else ? " " No . " " Are you and Mary perfectly happy ? " " At the moment , no . " " All right , you asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you thinking about getting a divorce ? " " Come to the point . " " That is my point . " " I know you . There 's something else . " " Then you come to the point . " " All right . Mary is seeing another guy . " " I 'll tell you something else . Mary is being seen with another guy . She was seen by me at the Princeton-Yale game , sitting on the Yale side about four rows in front of me . " " Did you speak to her ? " " No , but I was somewhat grateful to her . At least she gave Philadelphiasomething else to talk about besides John and me . And I want to warn you , Alfred . This is meant kindly . The man she was with wanted everybody to see him . He stood up every chance he got and waved to friends of his , and just generally showing her off . And there were a lot of them she knew . Is he an old beau ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , as though they just did n't care who knew it . That made me sore . I know where she spent that weekend , because I was invited to the same place , and you have my word for it , that particular host and hostess do n't go around checking who 's sleeping where . " " Would you mind telling me where ? " " Englewood . People named Cash . Joe and Peggy Cash . I 'm tattling , but I can assure you it 's an open secret now . The Cashes can put up  --  let me think  --  I 've been there when they 've had eight house guests . " " Why did they invite you if they knew Mary was coming ? " " Oh , the Cashes do n't invite the girls . They invite the men and the men bring whoever they please . John invited me , but I do n't like the Cashes . You see , John does n't know Mary . But he knows her friend , Mr. Roper ? " " Doctor Roper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself John said he was one of the people on the Cashes ' party . " " Well , do n't feel sorry that you told me . We have n't been pretending much lately . " " I 'm not sorry I told you . But I 'm sorry it happened to you . Have n't you got anybody ? " " Not really . "  |p492  " You love somebody besides Mary ? " " Yes , but it is n't going to work out . " " Does Mary know it ? " " Nobody knows it . There 's nothing to know . " " You ? Platonic love ? " " One kiss . " " That 's even worse than Platonic , from what I 've learned about you . I know somebody who still has a yen for you . Do you remember Clemmie Shreve ? " " Sure , but I did n't have an affair with her . " " I know , and she 's had a long time to regret it . She told me so herself . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start mooning over this other girl . If she wo n't sleep with you , forget her . You can have Clemmietomorrow night if you want to . I mean that literally . She 's in Philadelphia , and a very unhappy girl . " " Clemmie and I are a thing of the past , and we never were very much . What happened with her and her husband ? " " He turned into an awful drunkard . " " Maybe Clemmie drove him to it . " " Maybe she did . I 'm not suggesting that you marry her , but I just thought that you 'd want to see her . She has n't lost her looks , and I know for a fact that she still likes you . You have nothing to lose , " said Constance , then added , " now . " He was not , then , astounded when Clemmie Shreve Hennessey turned up for dinner the next evening . She drove out from Philadelphia in her own car , a red Packard roadster with six wire wheels and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue tweed suit and a Basque beret and a blue polka-dot scarf . She was not the picture of tragedy and through dinner she chatted like the Clemmie of old , substituting the names of winter and summer resorts for the colleges she had once talked about . Then Constance said : " Goodnight , you two , and good luck , " and left them . " You did n't want me to come , " said Clemmie . " To tell you the truth , no , " said Alfred . " But it 's good to see you , now that you 're here . You 're so damn pretty . " " I 'd better not lose that , because it seems to be all I have . What 's the matter with me , anyway ? I know I 'm not brilliant , but neither was John Hennessey . Did you ever meet Dorothy Parker ? " " No . " " Unfortunately John did . He met all those literary people . You know , the Hotel Algonquin Round Table ? He met them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now he thinks he 's one of them . I 'll bet they do n't . I know they do n't . He and Heywood Broun talk about baseball all the time and one night when we sat down with . Broun and Dorothy Parker I heard Dorothy say , The Spalding Guide . ' John thought it was funny . Then he and Broun talked , talked , talked about old first-basemen . John never heard anything Dorothy said , butp493when we got home he told me I was a stupid blonde , and why could n't I enter into the conversation instead of just sitting there . " " So you left him . " " He left me ! He has a girl friend that writes about fashions but her office is in the same office as Vanity Fair . That makes her one of the intelligentsia . " " You 're not unhappy , are you ? " " Not to lose him . But he goes around saying I have n't got a brain in my head , and he did n't marry me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , either . " " Why did you marry him ? " " Because he was good-looking , had money , was tapped for Death 's Head at Yale , and was older than you and the other boys I saw . And I thought sex . Ugh . Sex . He 'd get drunk and could n't do anything and then blame me for being cold . And when he was n't drunk it was always so quick that he was quite right , I was cold . I went to see a doctor and the doctor said I was all right , and told me to have my husband come and see him . But I knew that would be a waste of breath . John thinks he 's a real virile , hairy-chested man . Well , I then proceeded to have an affair with the doctor , lasting about a month or two , but he was too much sex . He gave me Hindu books and German books and  --  I think he must be trying to write a book himself , that doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , normal woman . But I certainly did n't want to make a career of it . He wanted me to write down every sex thought I had . Keep a sort of a diary . And I told him I could n't , or would n't do that , so he gave me up as a bad job , although actually I gave him up . " " You must have had some experience in between . " " I did . A writer . He was quite nice , but in love with someone else , and whenever she 'd raise her skirt just a little bit he 'd go running back to her . But at least he was nice to me . If he thought I was stupid , at least he did n't say so , and he did n't try to get me to furnish him with material for a book . I 'm not so sure that Constance has n't got the right idea . " " Except that one of these days she 'll find herself forty years old and Coddington settling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out in the cold . " " Well , fourteen years of being in love with a man ? Is that the worst thing that could happen to a woman ? It 's inconvenient at times , but unless you want to have children I can think of worse ways to spend your life . The trouble with me is that I 'll keep looking for a husband or somebody like John Coddington and before I 'm forty 1 ' 11 have slept with so many men I wo n't remember them all . And I 'd hate that . You know , Alfred , when I was young and so popular , there were really only two boys I liked . One was you , and the other was that friend of yours , Lex Porter . But you had your mind on someone else , and Lex  --  I said to him one time , You always seem to be ready to pounce on me , even when you 're sitting still . ' "  |p494  " Lex is still unattached . " " But maybe I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Look at us , you and me . We 're almost like brother and sister . " " That 's news to me . " " I said almost . Nothing would please Constance more than if I came tripping into your room in the dead of night , but do n't worry . I wo n't . I do n't even know where it is . " " It 's the floor above you , turn right at the top of the stairs . " She smiled . " Very chivalrous of you , but you have a family . " " Things are not what they seem , Clemmie . " " Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that . Serious ? " " I should think Constance would have hinted as much . " " She would n't have had me here if everything was going smoothly , that 's true . But I thought she was trying to do me a favor . Do you want me , Alfred ? " " Of course I do . " " Because I want you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to your room will you make me feel popular again ? You used to make me feel attractive , and desirable . I have n't felt that way lately . " " You 're as attractive and as desirable as you ever were . In some ways more so . " " It may be quite late . Will you just let me stay with you for a little while ? " " Stay all night . The servants go to the Mass on Sunday morning . The only person you have to watch out for is that battle-ax Miss Trimingham . She gives Mother her bath about nine o'clock . " " Oh , I would n't stay that long . " It was some time between midnight and two o'clock  --  the single strikes of the clock were lost as he dozed off  --  and he became conscious of her . She was standing beside his bed and in the light of his reading lamp he saw her , barefoot and in a blue silk dressing-gown . She smiled and dropped the dressing-gown and got into his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made love to her and she was ready for him at every moment . She continued to smile and was full of thoughts after the intensity was gone . " What ? " he said . " What am I thinking ? " " Yes . " " That I 've been needing this for years . With you . It was so nice . It could n't have been this way with anyone else . We owed this to each other for a long time , Alfred . What are you thinking ? " " Almost exactly the same thing . " " I knew everything about you but this . I 'm awfully happy . It is n't love , but it 's so friendly . I wanted you to feel good , and you wanted me to . " " And did you ? "  |p495  " Did , and do . You have n't for a long time , either , have you ? " " At least a month . " " This is the way affairs start . " " Usually . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have an affair that was just between us . When you needed somebody , or when I needed somebody . We would n't have to go out together and be talked about . Nobody 'd ever see us together . . . Of course it would never work out that way . But tonight it has . I 'm going to lie to Constance , and you do too . Shall we never tell anybody , anybody in the world ? " " All right . " " Can I stay here till daylight ? I 'd like to go to sleep with your arms around me . I promise I 'll wake up . " " I 'll promise you that . The chickens will see to that . " " Then it 's all right ? " " How much do you weigh ? Eighty-five ? " " A hundred and five . Why ? I 'm so small ? You never saw me with my shoes off . Not to mention . No , you 're not too heavy , if that was what was worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept for a while and he awoke with renewed desire and curiosity . In the beginning he made love to her while she was half asleep but this time it was longer and more sophisticated , the love-making of highly experienced and adept persons , in contrast with the earlier consummationthat had been postponed from their youth . She got out of bed and kissed him good-morning . " We may have to do this a lot , " she said , and left him . As to Alfred , he had an odd wish to tell everyone he knew that he had slept with Clemmie Shreve and that it had been wonderful . She was gone before he appeared for breakfast . " I 'm not very good as a procurer , " said Constance . " Well , you did your best , " said Alfred . " Did n't you even try ? " " What was the use ? I told you Clemmie and I were a thing of the past . It 's a mistake to try to arrange people 's lives for them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in New York before the usual Sunday-night supper hour of seven-thirty , and a few minutes ahead of Mary . " Oh , you 're back , " she said . She put her gloves and handbag on the foyer table and began taking off her hat and coat . He was sitting in the livingroom . He did not rise , and she did not go to him . " Have you seen the boys ? " " Yes , for a minute . " " I 'll be back in a minute , " she said . When she returned to the livingroom she sat down and lit a cigarette . " Are you back for good now , or is this just a visit ? " " For good . " " You finished up sooner than you expected . "  |p496  " Yes , and sooner than you expected too , probably . " " Yes , sooner than you 'd led me to expect . Have you had your sup-per ? " " It can wait . " " To be sure . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now that I 'm back you 're going to have to start behaving your-self . " " Did you say start ? " " You heard me . From now on I will use the guest-room . You can move my things in there tomorrow . " " Mother 's coming to New York this week . " " Mother can go to a hotel or sleep in the room with you . Any explanationyou want to give her is okay with me . This marriage , as a marriage , is all washed up , but that does n't mean you 're going to be allowed to do as you damn please . You 've had your fling . The next one , you and I talk to our lawyers . " " Oh , you have it all figured out . " " No , not all , but that much . I could divorce you now in New York State . " " But Mr. MacHardie would n't like that . " " Mr. MacHardie would n't like it , that 's correct . But there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know exactly what the medical associations do in cases like this , but I 'm sure they do n't give one of their members a gold medal for sleeping with patients . Before you interrupt  --  I did n't say you were a patient . I just happen to know about a woman who was a patient , and I 'm sure her husband would be delighted to name Roper . " " Oh , blackmail . " " Pressure . All I have to do is follow suit , because I have all the winning cards . if I named Roper and this other guy named Roper he 'd be through . You 're a clever girl , you can see that . As a matter of fact , of course , you 're not so damned clever . I could subpoena everybody that spent the night at the Cashes ' party . And I would . And would n't that make a beautiful story in the tabloids ? You think I would n't ? Well , I 'll tell you why I would . You flaunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having an affair when you were desperately in love and made every effort to keep it secret . Just stop to think of how many people already know that you slept with Roper , in Englewood , New Jersey . So it is n't as though I were the one to bring it out in public . You 've already done that . Hasbrouck , at the office , comes from Englewood . I did n't find out from him , but I 'll be curious to see what he says or does n't say tomorrow . No , they do n't like divorces at MacHardie &; Company , but I do n't particularly like having my wife thumb her nose at me and think she can get away with it . You see , you overestimated my dependence on MacHardie &; Company . I 've had other offers forp497more money , so let 's have it understood now that your next fling will be your last . At least as my wife . " She hesitated before answering , apparently going over all his points . " What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you my plans . " " No , I know you . You 'll have an affair with somebody . You have to . " " I deny that . " " Go ahead and deny it if you like , but you 'll get some woman to sleep with you . While that 's going on , what am I supposed to do ? Enter a convent ? " " I will not say anything that smacks of collusion , collusive adultery . I deny that I will have a mistress , and I refuse to condone your having a lover . Another lover , since you 've already had one . " " Listen , I 'm not afraid to say things out . Nobody 's listening , and we 're not in court  --  " " Yet . " " But I 'll tell you this , Alfred Eaton . The minute I find out you 're sleeping with another woman , I 'm going to have myself a lover , and you can sue me to hell and gone . I 'll bet you slept with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I deny that . " " Deny it , but I do n't believe you . " " I repeat , I deny it . " " I just wish I knew what big-mouth told you about the Cashes ' . " " I 'll give you a hint . It was somebody who was n't there but knowseverybody who was there . That just about leaves 120,000,000 people . " " All right , you win . Temporarily . But , oh , you better watch yourstep . You better be able to explain every minute of your time . " " I foresee no difficulty . " " Talk like a lawyer if you want to , but you 'll slip , if you have n't already . " " I 've been living at a very respectable , small-town hotel , and I spent the last couple of nights at my mother 's . And I expect to be here every night till I 'm sent away again , and that wo n't be till spring . Of course if you 're going to keep tabs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , dear heart . " The telephone rang . " I 'm sure it 's for you , " said Alfred . " I 'll be listening to every word . " She answered the ring but the call was for Alfred , and it was Hasbrouck . " I 'm going to be uptown all day tomorrow , " he said . " Why do n't you take the day off and meet me for lunch at one o'clock at the Astor ? " " Did you say the Astor ? " " Yes , and plan to be with me for at least an hour if you can . " Hasbrouck had something on his mind.  |p498They  met a few minutes before one o'clock and after they ordered their food Hasbrouck began to reveal how much he had on his mind . " Alfred , I 'm so much older than you that I know you 'll permit me to exercise certain prerogatives that go with my age . " Such was his preamble , but he continued without waiting for Alfred 's granting of the prerogatives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " " Very well , we can go on . I know what it is , but I had to be sure you would admit it . The firm is very paternalistic in the best sense of the word , about the promising younger men , and you 're perfectly well able to see for yourself that you are highly thought of . It 's almost a sure thing that we 're going to take your advice , whatever it may be , on this latest job of yours . The next job will be bigger , with more responsibility , and the one after that will be still bigger . You know where you 're headed , everybody in the financial district knows . " Now this trouble you 're having at home , it was very distressing because of its possible effect on you . Not altogether unselfish on our part , but more so than you might think . When you 're one of the family  --  and you 're considered just that  --  we back you up , we cover up for you , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you does n't end with the business relationship . So when we heard about this , uh , domestic infelicity we knew we might have to do something about it . I do n't like to talk about these things in the office , so I arranged to spend the day away from there . I changed a dentist appointment , seeingthe man from Peal shoes , my tailor , and so forth and so on . But the most important thing was seeing you . " It took Hasbrouck half an hour to state all the facts : after hearing about Mary at the Cash party , and incidentally learning the names of all others present , Hasbrouck had made sure that Mary 's affair was an open secret , " more open than secret . " He had then gone to Wilmingtonand had an " informal " conversation with Eugene St. John , asking him to take no action at the time , but extracting from him a promise to speak to Mary if necessary or advisable or desirable . " And that is where the matter stands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you very much , and I hereby resign from MacHardie &; Company . I 'll finish my report on the Buffalo , Fort Penn &; Trenton matter , and I 'll leave when I 've handed it in . " " Let me hear your reason for wanting to resign . " " Well , there is only one . I think it 's none of the firm 's damn business what my wife does . " Hasbrouck smiled . " Never underestimate James D. MacHardie . " " I never would . I never have . " " Mr. MacHardie predicted this , and almost gave me your very words . He said you would probably tell me to go to hell . " " It just came out differently , Mr. Hasbrouck . I 'm surprised that Mr. St. John did n't tell you to go to hell . "  |p499  " Mr. St. John is older and less impetuous , and he realizes that what was good for your interests is also good for his daughter 's . " " He 's also intimidated by du Pont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wrong . " " You thought he might be . That 's why you went to him . " " Mr. MacHardie anticipated that , too . There was no intimidation for the very good reason that there could be none . The du Pont people are n't afraid of us . They do business with the people across the street . " " Then I certainly do n't understand why Mr. St. John did n't tell you to go to hell . " " Well , he did n't because he 's fond of you , and if there 's anything he or I or anyone else can do to save your marriage , he 's for it . For instance , I did n't tell him the name of the man involved , but he guessed it . Mr. St. John said he was always afraid his daughter was going to marry that man , and he was so delighted when she married you instead , so relieved . " " Mr. St. John is a fine man . I 'm sorry he had to know anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred . Knowing it now may help to stave off any drastic action on your part . That is , if you would like him to have a talk with his daughter . " " I do n't . I do n't see any future for the marriage , but at this moment we are not going to get a divorce . " " I 'm glad to hear that , no matter what else you do . But I 've failed ? The resignation still stands ? " " It still stands , Mr. Hasbrouck . " " In that case , will you have lunch with Mr. MacHardie on Wednes-day ? " " Of course . " Nothing much mattered between the lunch with Hasbrouck and the appointment with MacHardie , not even the new relationship with Mary . It was too soon for any real test of that . Alfred waited upon MacHardie , who bustled in , said , " One-thirty , " to Simmons , and with a nod of his head indicated the wheeled table with its covered dishes . " I ordered for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be interrupted . " He placed his finger tips on the edge of the table and sat looking at them until he heard the click of the door closing behind Simmons , and then looked up and faced Alfred . " Mr. Hasbrouck feels that somehow he 's failed . I do n't think he failed . I do n't know what else he could have done , and I do n't know what else you could have done . Under the circumstances . You not only have a future with this firm . You have a past . You 've worked hard and well , and successfully . You 've given up your own pleasures and pastimes to remain here until three and four o'clock in the morning . You are thirty years old , too old to start with another firm , but with five good , sound , basic years put in here . You ca n't afford to throw that away . What do you say to that , young man ? "  |p500  " With all due respect , sir , I say that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I say , with all due respect , that you can afford nothing of the kind . It is n't money that counts now . It 's time . In ten years you will be forty , and you know how we do things here . In ten years you 'll be told whether you get one of the roll-top desks , or become  --  let 's be truthful  --  one of our working pensioners . You know what I mean by that  --  the men who have jobs here , but can never hope to become partners . If you leave us , you will be giving all the other men at your next place of business a five-year advantage . Can you , or any man , take a fiveyearchunk of his life and hand it to his rivals on a silver platter ? No . You can not . " There 's more to it than that , too . It is n't only the matter of five years . It 's five years of good association , earned respect , increasing responsibilityand pleasant experience . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here you know everybody that you have to know , and we know you . Who is Miss Loughran ? Miss Loughran is Mr. Hasbrouck 's secretary . Who is Miss Bumble-bee ? I do n't know , you do n't know . Miss Bumble-bee is the secretary to a junior partner in some other firm . Who is Mrs. Kelly ? Mrs. Kelly is our trained nurse . Who is Mrs. Penwiper ? I do n't know . Mrs. Penwiper is the woman in the supply room in some other firm . Two years wasted while you 're finding out who Mrs. Penwiper and Miss Bumble-bee are . Do you know what thirty is ? It 's the beginning of middle age . Thirty to fifty . From fifty on you have no right or reason to expect to live another day . Between forty and fifty are the years when you may properly expect to reap the benefits of your ability and experience . In our previous conversation I believe you said you wanted to have five million by the time you 're forty . I said you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your calculations , your average would have to be $340,000 a year . Obviously you have n't maintained that average . Do you think you can maintain it , and more , by going elsewhere and handing over a seven-year advantage ? Or , in the light of recent events , have you decided to settle for considerably less than four million ? " " In the light of recent events in the stock market I could still have the five million at forty . " " Or lose your shirt . I thought you had that gambling instinct of yours under control . " " It 's under control , but it has n't disappeared . " " So , as I see it , you plan to leave here and become a speculator . " " I might do that , " said Alfred . " It was one of the possibilities I 've been considering . " " No . You would n't like that . Not any more . It 's too late for that . " " Why ? " " Because you might enjoy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unsatisfactory . Since you 've been with this firm you 've learned to enjoy the satisfaction of working for your money . Studying a proposition , really learning something about it , and **28;59;TOOLONG with a topic of current importance . The protective tariff . " She explained the tariff as something the Republicans in Congresswere devising to ruin the country . She used the proposed tariff on tin as an example . " Tomorrow , you can go into a certainstore and buy a tin cup for five cents . Next year , if Mr. McKinley has his way , the same tin cup , in the same store , will cost you twenty-five cents . " " Pst , Mick Mack , " whispered Patsy across the aisle . " What store does she mean ? " " Why , the certain store what sells tin cups , " said Mick Mack . Patsy gave him a contemptuous look as he thought : Why the durtee little showoff of a mane en ! He spoke to me ! thought Mick Mack rapturously . Now I have a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to dress up and have Mary wave to him from the parlor window as he left . He liked the admiring glances the girls walking on the street gave him . He liked his teacher and he liked to despise Mick Mack . It made him glow all over . It was coming on Christmas and Miss McCarthy made an announcement . " Tomorrow will be our last class before the Christmasvacation . No one of you is to bring me a Christmas present of any sort whatever . Is that clear ? " The next night , the last session , she came in lugging a large suitcase . " What 's that for ? " Patsy whispered to Mick Mack . " Christmas presents . " " What Christmas presents ? " " What we all is going to give her . " True , there was a Christmas-wrapped package on every desk but his . He was the only one who had taken her literally . He was embarrassed . He liked his teacher and would have liked to give her a present . " But why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present ? " " ' T is the style in America , " said Mick Mack , " to say you do n't want no presents , it being a hint that means do n't forget to give me a present . " " Someday , " said Patsy , grinding his teeth , " you 're going to get  |p51|pucked  right in the nose because you think you know so much . " " And you , me friend , will be at me side to lick hell out of the man what tries it . " It was June and school was over . Patsy escorted Miss McCarthy home to avoid walking with Mick Mack . He knew the little man would get sentimental , want to exchange addresses , to plan other meetings , and Patsy wanted none of that . Patsy missed the classes . He was sorry he had n't obtained Mick Mack 's address . Not that he liked the man . Oh , no ! It was just that Patsy had a couple of things to say to him that he , Mick Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't put Mick Mack in his place . He still had a thing or two he 'd like to tell him . PATSY had been in America a year . His steamship passage was paid in full and he owed nothing more on his clothes . He had about thirty dollars saved . He 'd heard from his mother twice in the year . Both letters told him his had been received and hoped more would follow . She wrote no news of Maggie Rose or of the people he knew ; of the village or of herself . Both letters were copied from Bertie 's book with no personal interpolations . Patsy felt he ought to leave Moriarity and get a better job but he did n't know how to go about it . Then he reasoned that a new job might be worse than the old . Eventually , he decided it was better to put up with the drawbacks he had become used to than to take on unknown ones . Besides , in a way , he would have missed Mary . He was not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on her kindness and her understanding ways . Each time he thought of Biddy , however , he thought a new job could n't be worse than the one he had . She was a nuisance . He suffered many indignities from her . She made him run trivial errands and help with the dishes . She made him listen to her tire/some views on life , love , drinking , religion and what not . When he showed his lack of interest , she had a way of getting close to him and nudging him with her big , hard bust until she had him backed into a corner . There she held him with her barrier bust and made him listen to her homilies . Jessie , one of the mares , had the same trick of nudging him into a corner and leaning against him when he tried to curry her . Biddy was also getting what he called forward . She was the kind that , had he made advances to her , she 'd have cracked his head open . But she was also the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't worth making advances to . She had him nudged into a corner one afternoon , trying to get him to agree with her that Teddy Roosevelt had false teeth . He thought otherwise but was on the point of agreeing with her in order to get away , when she suddenly dropped the argument and , in plain earthy words , made him a point-blank proposition . Now Patrick Dennis was not one to refuse any bounty that came his way , but he liked his bounty young and fresh and softly yielding and not iron-bound like Biddy . " I could not do so , " he blurted out , " with you . " " So you think you could do better , eh ? " she said ominously . " ' T is not that , " he said placatingly , " but ' t would have to be with marrying . " God forgive the lie , he thought , but what a grand , good way to get out of this sitcheeashun . " I got to marry you for that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd think of marrying . " " Who was asking you ? " he said . " If I could n't do better . . . " " What 'd you say ? " she growled . " Nothing , " he said hastily . " And take me apology for it if I did . Sure and you 'd make me a fine wife , the way you work hard and the way you 're healthy .... " " Oh , Paddy , dear ! " She fluttered her eyes . " Only , " he continued , " I would want a younger woman . . . not too young , " he added hastily , afraid of insulting her again . " Someone about Miss Mary 's age ? " she asked . " I do not think about her that way  --  as me wife , " he said . " You think right , " she said . " She 'd never marry a stable boy . "  | " She could go farther and do worse , " said Patsy , stung . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you ! " " She would so , " cried Patsy indignantly . The argument went on . Because of Biddy 's forever saying that Mary would n't spit on him and that he was n't fit to clean her shoes and because Moriarity was always warning him not to get " idears " about his daughter , Patsy gave more and more thought to Mary. 1 do n't want her , he thought , and the Lord knows she do n't want me  --  and not because I 'm a stable boy either . This is not the old country where the stable boy does not marry the lord 's daughter . This is America , where ' t is the style , like Mick Mack would say , for the poor working man to marry the boss 's daughter . Them books she gives me to read : All about poor boys what marries the rich boss 's daughter and the poor boy then owns the factory when the old man croaks . A thought struck him . Did she ask me to read that book thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah , no , he decided ; she ai n't tricky the way women is . Is she far above me like Biddy says ? Sure , she has the grand education sitting in school till she was twenty studying to be a teacher . And meself ? Six years of schooling I had . But did I not learn Latin good the way Father hit me on me head with his shillelagh ( after Mass , to give him his due ) when I did n't say it right when I was his altar boy ? She plays the piano to be sure . But do 1 not have the ear for music the way I can . . . the way I could , keep time to any tune was played the while I jigged ? She 's rich and I 'm poor . And that 's the God 's truth . But all her father 's money could n't buy for her what I do have for nothing : me youth . I 'm twenty-one and she 's twenty-seven . And that 's old  --  old for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could walk with a girl on each arm for the asking . But poor Miss Mary ! Sure and she 's never had a man make up to her . Then there is looks . She is sweet , but ah , she 's plain in her face . So plain . And where is her shape ? And me ? I 'd be lying to meself did I not tell meself I 'm good looking and I 'll say an Act of Contrition for me pride in me looks before I sleep this night.  |p54So  , Patsy came to his conclusion . She would n't be so bad off marrying me . But I will not think of it for do I not love Maggie Rose and 1 could never love another . And does she not wait for me with love ? ' T is a lie she has another feller . She could love no one else after me . And when I get me thousand dollars saved up , I 'll go back . I 'll tell her the waiting time is over and .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second year in America . After supper now , Patsy sat on the stone bench in the paved areaway onto which the iron-grilled door of the basement dining room opened . He 'd sit there and smoke an after-supper pipe , trying to put off the time when he 'd have to go back to his miserable little room . He watched the comings and goings of the people on the street and stared at the folk who climbed the step to ring Moriarity 's bell . He was n't at all interested . He was curious . On Friday nights , many policemen , in and out of uniform , came to the door . The procedure was always the same . A cop rang the bell . Moriarity appeared and put out his hand . Instead of shaking it , the cop put something in it . The Boss put some of it back into the cop 's hand and the cop went down the stoop , saluting another cop who was on the way up . Eventually , his curiosity made him ask Biddy what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you living in the yard this year or more past and you do n't know ? Why ' t is graft , yes , it is , what The Boss is collecting . From the witch houses . They ca n't run without paying . The madams pay the cops so the cops wo n't run them in . The cops pay our Boss so he wo n't snitch on them to the Big Cheese . " " And who is the Big Cheese ? " " The feller what takes half the graft The Boss collects from the cops what collects from the madams . " " Ca n't The Boss be arrested for that ? " " And who would arrest him ? " " A co " " They ca n't because all the cops is in on the graft , too , and who would arrest them ? " One October night , Patsy was sitting on the stone bench smok/ing his stub-stem clay pipe when he saw a big cop heft himself up the stoop . He was used to the cops coming but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday night . The other cops came on Friday night . The big cop pressed the button . Moriarity opened the door and put out his hand . Instead of putting something into it , the cop shook it warmly . The Boss , surprised , pulled his hand away and wiped it on his coat . " Excuse me , " said the cop . " I live in East New York but me beat is in Manhattan . " Patsy was alerted . There was something about that voice .. . " What the hell are you doing here then , in my precinct ? Go see the commissioner if you want a transfer . " " I came to see about . . . " Patsy lost the rest because the big cop 's voice dropped to a whisper . But he was sure he heard his name mentioned . " And this is his address , " concluded the cop in his normal voice . The Boss leaned down over the stoop . " Boy ? " Patsy looked up . The Boss waited . Patsy got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the pipe from his mouth . Then Moriarity spoke . " Patrick , the officer wants to see you . Take him to your room . " Patsy was up the ladder in a hurry . He lit the kerosene lamp while the big cop , with many a sigh and a wheeze , hefted himself up the ladder . The cop removed his helmet . There was that nimbus of red around his bald head . . . . The cop looked around for a place to sit . His feet hurt so . But there was only one chair in the room and he was too polite to take it without an invitation . Finally Patsy sat on the cot and the big man took the chair . He sighed in relief . He introduced himself : " I 'm the feller what licked you back in County Kilkenny nearly two years ago . " Yes , Patsy had known it was Big Red . And what did he want of him now , Patsy wondered . " I do n't hold it against meself that I licked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'm hoping that you 'll let bygones be bygonesbeing 's everything turned out fine in the end . " Patsy 's heart leaped up . Everything turned out fine , Big Red said . Could that mean that Maggie Rose was in America now withp56her big brother and Big Red had come to ask Patsy to marry his sister ? Yes . That 's what he must have come for . And he 'd marry Maggie Rose . Yes , he would ! " Yes . It all turned out fine for you and for me sister . You 've got a good job and me baby sister ... " Eagerly , Patsy leaned forward and put his hand on Big Red 's knee . He was so happy he could hardly speak . " Maggie Rose ! Where is she ? How is she ? " " She 's happy as a lark . " He smiled tenderly . " She 's expecting . " " Expecting ? Expecting what ? " " Sure and you must have heard ? She married a few months after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " croaked Patsy . " Me sister . ' T was from her husband I got your address . " " What husband ? " " Hers . You know him . The feller what sold you the ticket to run away from me to America ? " Big Red laughed . " He was quite a ketch , I hear , the way he came ten miles on his bicycle twice a week to court her . " " He married her on me own wheel ? " said Patsy , bewildered . " And the money given me for it stolen ? " " How 's that ? " asked Big Red , equally perplexed . " The Liverpool sport ? " " I ca n't tell you what make ' t was . " " So she is married , " said Patsy drearily . " That she is . And happy , she writes me . Ah , I did you wrong , " said Big Red humbly , " crossing the sea to come between you . Many 's the Novena I did for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the worst . But me own mother did her best to make the trouble and your mother , God rest her soul , would n't listen to me .... " " Me mother ? " interrupted Patsy . " You said , God rest ... ' ? " That 's how Patsy found out his mother had died . It was almost too much to bear . In a few minutes he knew he 'd lost his Maggie Rose and his mother forever . Big Red kept talking , hoping to get him over the first shock . He assured the boy his mother had not died alone . Her oldest boy , Neeley , who had gone to Australia before Patsy was born ,  |p57had  returned to her a few months before her death ; Neeley 's wife having died and his children long since scattered or married . Patsy held in his grief . He did n't want Big Red to see him weep . Men wept only before women ; not before other men . When Patsy could hold back his grief no longer , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash his face . He went down and washed in the horse trough . His tears mingled freely with the water from the tap . He thought as he wept : Had I but stayed a while longer , he thought in anguish , 1 could have held Maggie Rose to me and now with me mother gone , the way would have been clear for Maggie Rose and me . Not that I 'd have me mother die . But if she had to go .. . He dried his face with the rough towel that had been issued him at the house and knelt before the trough to say his prayer for the dead . The horses shifted weight in the dark stable and made the straw rustle and Patsy was glad for the company of the sound . The big yellow cat weaved toward him , arched its back and leaned against his thigh for an instant , then sat close to him , lifted a paw and started to wash itself . Patsy felt less alone for the closenessof the cat . When he got back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt , tie , socks and shoes laid out . He urged Patsy to dress up . " ' T is not right you spend the evening alone , " said Big Red . " The last thing me Lottie said to me when I left the house was : You bring him home with you , hear ? Do n't let the poor boy stay alone with his sorrow the night long . ' Ah , you 'll like me Lottie , " said Big Red . " She 'll take your mother 's place in a way . " Patsy went because he did n't want to be alone . Big Red held his arm . He thought the awareness of another human being would help Patsy a little . He held him the only way he knew how : the way he held a man he was arresting  --  his right hand clasped firmly about Patsy 's upper left arm , Patsy pulled close to him and propelled to walk a few steps before Big Red . It looked like an arrest , Big Red being in uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lottie too , whether he was in uniform or not . People on the street reacted . Those whose pleasure came from the ill luck of others thought : I do n't know what he did but I 'm glad they caught him . Kinderp58people thought : The poor thing ! So young to go wrong . I hope they 're easy on him . The Moriarity household watched him leave with the policeman . Biddy watched from behind the bars of the basement diningroomwindow . The Boss and The Missus watched from behind the lace curtains of the parlor and Mary watched alone from the music room . They saw how pale and drawn his face looked under the street light . Biddy was sure in her mind that Patsy Moore had raped a servant girl and gotten her in the family way . The Miss us was sure he 'd stolen a bag of money because it would be Christmas soon and he wanted to buy presents for everyone . Moriarity had it figured out . The big cop was a stool pigeon sent by the reform candidate who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking Patsy away so that the higher-ups of the reform party could force him to inform on the activities of him , Michael Moriarity . Only Mary felt the truth . He has had news that grieved him , she thought . CHAPTER EIGHTLorriE made up a little party for Patsy . She sent Big Red out to the delicatessen for smoked whitefish , slabs of creamy , smoked sturgeon and wedges of smoked eel . She gave him instructions to get a dozen bottles of light beer  --  off the ice . ( She did n't think it was refined to run down for a pail of draft beer when company came . ) Lottie thoughtfully plied Patsy with food . " Eat , " she said . " It will help you forget your sorrows and troubles . " Big Red asked for permission to soak his feet . He explained that he 'd gone to Moriarity 's directly from work and had n't had an opportunity . . . His request was graciously granted by wife and guest.  |p59The  food was gone , the beer was nearly gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about . Big Red thought a little entertainment was in order . He asked Lottie to sing . She demurred , as was proper , and modestly confessed she had never had her voice cultivated . Big Red told her she was too bashful for her own good . He told Patsy that she had a grand voice . She broke down under the coaxing and said she 'd sing if Big Red would accompany her on his bugle . He demurred too , because in polite society one must not be too eager to show off one 's talent . After the coaxing had gone on too long and Patsy and Lottie were about to take his word for it that he could n't blow a note , he gave in , rummaged in the clothes closet , and came up with his bugle . He stood in the middle of the parlor in his bare feet and , after a few false starts , he played a stirring reveille . After he had gotten all of the neighbors ' children out of bed , he tapered off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Lottie sang : Oh , the-e-e-yice man Is a nice man .. . When her song was done , he lifted his bugle and played a long-drawn-out taps . Widdy , who had arisen from his cot at reveille , now crawled back after taps . It had been a short day for him . Lottie waited until the boy was sound asleep again before she suggested they ought to get Widdy up to recite " Hiawatha . " Big Red went in and shook him awake . Widdy stood in the middle of the parlor . He took a short cut through the coaxing . He was anxious to get back to bed . By the shores of Gitchee Goomee , By the shining Big-Sea-Water , Stood the wigwam of Nokomis . Daughter of the moon , Nokomis . He droned on and on and on in a monotonous singsong . When he had finished , Patsy clapped in delirious and noisy delight  --  not in praise but in deep gratitude that the interminable droning was at an end . Widdy wanted to go back to bed but Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening.  | " This you must not miss , me son , " he said . He turned to Patsy . " Would you now , Pathrick , dance one of your grand old Irish jigs for us ? " Lottie put her hands together and made a sound of ecstasy . Patsy shook his head . Well , that was right  --  to refuse at first ; not to seem eager . They understood . He wanted his full share of coaxing . " Pretty please ? " begged Lottie . " With whipped cream on top ? " " I could n't , " said Patsy . " Do n't be like that , boy , " said Big Red heartily . Under the coaxing , Patsy 's feet started to tingle . The rotation of the steps raced through his mind . He was about to make the speech of acceptance : **25;89;TOOLONG , but-I'll-try , when Widdy had to put in his two cents ' worth . " Hey , Pop ! Ai n't this the feller you licked that time you went to Ireland , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " moaned Lottie piteously . " Shut up , son , " said Big Red , low and ominously . " But , Pop ! " Widdy made puzzled peaks out of his eyebrows . " You said ! You told me and Mom how you licked the ... " The back of Big Red 's hand , with tufts of red hair on the knuckles , made an arc and landed on Widdy 's cheek . The blow sent the kid halfway across the parlor . " That 'll learn you , " said Big Red . " You and your Nokomis ! " " It 's past his bedtime , " said Lottie . " What 's he doing up so late then ? " He turned to yell at Widdv . " Get back in bed , " he shouted , " where you belong ! " I could kill him , thought Patsy . Him and his whelp ! " I got to go , " said Patsy . " Now , " said Big Red , " you know how kids is . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just going to make some strong hot coffee and send Timmy down to see if the baker 's is still open and get a crumb cake . " " I 'll thank you for me cap and for nothing else , " said Patsy . Lottie , with tears in her eyes , begged him to stay . Big Red assured him that he would n't have had it happen for a million dollars but what can you do with kids ? When they saw that Patsy was not to be moved , Big Red went to the door with him and said the correct farewell words :  | " Now that you know the way to our house , do n't be a stranger . " " May God strike me dead , " said Patsy passionately , " if I ever set foot in this house again ! " " I had enough out of you , " said Big Red . " A mistake was made . All right ! I apologized . What do I get back ? May God strike you dead if you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop dead if I ever let you set foot in this house again ! " " Yeah ? " said Patsy . " Yeah ! And another thing : Oncet I crossed the ocean to give you a good licking . This time I just got to cross Newtown Creek to give you more where that first licking came from . " " Yeah ? " " Yeah ! " " Yeah ? " repeated Patsy . " Well , listen ! " He opened the door and put one foot out . " I 'll bury youse all , " shouted Patsy . " And enjoy me bowl of pot cheese after the funeral . " Then he ran like hell . CHAPTER NINE 94MARY , sitting at her window and waiting for Patsy , saw him come home about one A.M. He had stopped in at the saloon to have a few beers and to brood . He climbed up to his loft and without lighting the lamp threw himself on his cot . Mary slipped out of the house in her dressing gown and bedroomslippers . She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the horses whinnied and for a second she was afraid someone would awaken in the house . She waited . No light went on . She called Patsy 's name . He did n't answer , pretending not to hear . She climbed up to his room . He lit the lamp . She went to the table and turned the lamp low . He was in a panic . " Miss Mary , please go , " he said . " God help me if your father finds you in me room this late . " " Never mind my father , " she said . " Patrick , please tell me all  |p62about  it . " He shook his head . " You 've had bad news from Ireland . " He said nothing . " Is it your mother ? " He turned away from her . " I am your friend , Patrick . Tell your friend your troubles . Do n't hold them to yourself . A trouble shared is a trouble halved . Tell me , Patrick . It may help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He spoke of his boyhood , his mother , Rory-Boy and Maggie Rose . He told of being whipped by Big Red and how he had sneaked out of Ireland and how his money had been stolen his first day in America . And then he told of his mother 's death and Maggie Rose 's marriage and the humiliating evening at Big Red 's home . Her eyes were filled with tears all during his story . " And now , " he concluded , " me old life is gone and the new life I 'm making . . . I mean the new life everyone is making for me is no good . I do n't like nobody no more and I do n't want nobody to like me . " " You do n't mean that , Patrick . You say that because you 've been so hurt ; and so alone in a strange land . " " I mean it . I 'm never going to give nothing to nobody and I 'm going to take everything I can get from everybody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , Patrick , " she said . " You could never live like that . Why , you 're so young  --  so full of life . Everyone would like you so much if only you 'd let people .... " Suddenly , he broke down and wept piteously . She held out her arms in compassion . " Come to me , Patrick dear , " she said . " Come to me . " She stood before him , her arms outstretched toward him . Her loose robe concealed the way she was straight up and down withoutcurves . Her hair hung loose to her waist and the golden lamplight made her pass for pretty . Because he was so lonesome and so starved for love , he went to her . She held him tightly and kept saying : " There now . There now . " She was like a mother soothing a child . " There now , " she said . He put his arms about her waist and she stroked his shoulder and said : " There now . Do n't cry any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how tightly they held each other , there was no blending . Her body stayed straight andp63stiff . It did not know how to relax against his . He thought of the last time he had held Maggie Rose  --  how her little waist curved in and her thighs curved out . He remembered the evening . He had stood with one foot up on a stone wall and she had leaned against him . He remembered how his upraised thigh had fitted the curve of her waist and how the curve of his arm fitted all around her . When a girl and a man fit together so grand , he thought , sure God made them for each other . And why did I ever leave me own Maggie Rose ? He sighed . And this good girl I 'm holding in me arms now , he thought sadly , we will never fit together . He was quiet and she thought he was comforted . " I will leave you now , " she said . She waited . He kissed her cheek . He held the lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loft . After she had slipped back into the house , he came down from his loft and stood in the yard . He leaned against the stable and smoked his pipe and thought of Mary  --  how good she was ; how kind and understanding . He felt warm toward her . It was almost like love . Then his mood was broken . Biddy came out from behind a snowball bush . " Ah , so , " she said . " So me pretty man changed his mind about waiting for the marrying before he did  --  you know what . " " Go away , Biddy , " he said wearily . " That I wo n't till I 've had me say . " He looked at her with aversion . Her hair was in a thick braid down her back and the end of it twitched and writhed around her backside like a black snake . She wore a crepe kimono and her flesh was unconfined beneath it . There was a continuous movementunder the kimono as though something were boiling inside . Patsy winced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , and them not being hoisted up and resting on top of the corset . " I seen youse , " she said . " There I was sleeping and I heard this noise and what do I do but I wake up . First , I thought it was only the horses nooling around in the straw . Then I looked up at your window and saw youse spooning against the lamplight . " " Go back to bed , " he said . He emptied his pipe by tapping it against the heel of his shoe . He stamped out the few live coalsp64and turned to go back to his room . " Good night , " he said . " Listen ! " she raised her voice . " I 'm going to tell The Boss on you . On the both of youse . " " Do so , " he whispered savagely , " and I 'll tell The Boss on you ! How you put in your Thursday night off by working in Madame Della 's aitch house in Greenpoint . " She sucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight . " ' T is a black lie , " she choked out . " I know it , " he agreed . " But The Boss will take it for true . For is he not the one who likes to think the worst of everyone ? " " You 'll see ! " she threatened . At breakfast next morning , Mary told her parents of the death of Patsy 's mother . " Is he an orphan then ? " asked The Missus . " Why not ? " said Mike . " And we all got to go someday . " He laved condensed milk over cooked ground horse 's oats in a soup plate . " Papa , " said Mary , " Patrick 's too good for the stable . He was n't meant to be a servant . Could n't you use your influence .. . pull ... to get him better work ? " " Nothing doing , " said her father . " I 'll not give meself the trouble of breaking in a new stable boy . " " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the top floor of the house . That stable room is n't fit for a man to live in . " " The next thing you know , " he said jokingly , " you 'll be wanting to marry him . " " I do , " she said quietly . " And I will if he asks me . " " Yah-ha-ha ! Yah-ha-ha ! " laughed Mike . " You and the stable boy ! That 's rich . Ya-ha ... " Then something unprecedented happened . The Missus spoke up to The Boss ! " I do n't see nothing to laugh at , " she said . He put down his spoon with meticulous care . " What did you say , Missus ? " he asked ominously . " She 's going on twenty-eight , " said The Missus . " So far no one asked her to get married . " ( Mary winced . ) " So I say if the boy wants to marry her , let him . She might not get no other chance . "  | " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkin ring as though to throw it at her . The Missus jumped up so suddenly that her chair fell over backward . " Nothing , " she whispered . " I did n't say nothing . Excuse me . " She scuttled out of the room . " See what you done ? " Mike asked his daughter . " You and your loony talk at the table . Made your mother so nervous she could n't eat . " " Excuse me , Papa , " said Mary quietly . " I 'm almost late for my class . " She left him alone with his now cold horse 's oats . Patsy was sweeping the sidewalk . The Boss peeped through the lace curtains and watched Mary as she stopped to talk to the stable boy . She seemed to be talking eagerly . He saw Patsy nod his head from time to time and he saw them smile at each other . She patted the boy 's shoulder in farewell . He waved to her when she turned for a backward look . Mike waited until Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Patsy . He came up silently behind him and shouted : " You ! " It pleased him when Patsy almost dropped his broom . " Listen , you ! You keep your place . Hear ? Let me see you getting friendly with Miss Mary and you 'll hear from me . Get me ? " " She wants to be me friend . ' T is kind of her . " " I told you before : She 's kind to everyone . Even the mongrel dogs on the street . And I tell you again : Do n't get idears . " " What idears ? " " Like you think you 're good enough to marry her . " " I do not have such an idear . But if I wanted to marry her and she wanted to marry me , whose business would it be ? Only ours , being 's we 're both of age . But rest your mind . I 'm not thinking of marrying . " " I 'm glad to hear it , " said Mike sarcastically . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially marrying a stable boy . " " I was n't born a stable boy , " said Patsy , quietly . " You made me one . And Mary ... " " Miss Mary , " corrected Mike.  | " Mary , " continued Patsy evenly , " do n't look on me as just a stable boy . " " Deary me , no , " said Mike mincingly . " She loves you . " " Yes , " said Patsy quietly . " And you love her ? " Patsy hesitated before he answered . He said : " I 'm attached to her . " " Attached to her ! Attached , you say , Mister Pathrick Dennis Moore ! And would it be that she 's me only child and she and her husband would fall in for all of me property and money when me and The Missus dies have anything to do with this here attach-ment ? " " Yes , " said Patsy . " If I have to put up with the likes of you for a father-in-law , by God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Get off me property , " bellowed Mike . " Get the hell out of me house ! " " Stable , " corrected Patsy . " You 're sacked ! No recommendation . Pack up your rags and get ! " Patsy did n't pack up and he did n't " get , " because the next day he and Mary were married by a clerk in City Hall . CHAPTER TENTHEY came home directly from City Hall . The Missus wept because there had n't been a big church wedding with a Nuptial Mass . But Mary seemed very happy . From time to time , she looked at the wedding ring on her finger and smiled at Patsy . Patrick Dennis swaggered with his hands in his pockets and grinned at his father-in-law . Biddy stood listening behind a half-closed door with her mouth hanging open in amazement . Mike Moriarity was the only one who did n't act normal . He acted as though he were thinking ; as though he had been strickenp67speechless . His silence made his wife and daughter nervous . " Wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . " Let 's see your papers , " he said suddenly . Nervously but happily , she got her marriage certificate out of her reticule and gave it to him . He examined it . " Ha ! " he said . " So you was n't married by a priest ? " " No . " " There was n't time , " began Patsy . " And you came right home from City Hall ? " asked Mike , ignoring Patsy . " Of course , Papa . " " Good ! " He gave an order to his wife . " Missus , get me hat and coat . " " Now , Michael , " she started to say . " Quiet ! " he shouted . " I mean , " said The Missus timidly , " could n't we have a glass of wine first ? All of us ? Kind of celebrate ? " " There 'll be a celebration all right , later on , " he said grimly . " But not what you think . " " Where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Excuse me for asking . " " I 'm going straight to Judge Cronin and get this marriage an-nulled . " " You ca n't ! " wailed The Missus . " Sure I can . Cronin owes me a favor . " " I mean they 're married good . " " Oh , no , they ai n't . Did n't you hear her say they came right back from City Hall without stopping anywheres ? " " But ... " " That means the marriage was n't con . . . consa . . . It was n't consumed ! " he said triumphantly . He rushed out of the house . The Missus ran after him . " You ca n't , Michael , " she panted as she caught up with him . " Do n't you tell me what to do . " " But what will she do with the baby ? " wailed The Missus . " And she not married ? " He stopped so suddenly that his Missus bumped into him . He grabbed her arm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his . "  | " How do you know ? " " Biddy told me . " " How does she know ? " " She saw Mary up in his room . In her nightgown , Biddy said . And they was hugging and kissing . . . " The Missus blushed . " ... and all . Biddy saw the whole thing . " " Why' n't she tell me ? " " Because she was afraid of Patrick . He said he 'd kill her if she told . That 's what she said to me anyways . " Slowly he walked back to the house with The Missus jogging along beside him . Arriving home , he gave her his hat and coat to hang up , and , without a word to anyone , he went into his den and locked the door . Alone there , he put his head down on his desk and wept . He wept because all the plans he 'd had for his daughter had come to nothing . When she was twenty , he had hoped she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful future . But Mary had been too shy to encourage the young man . Now the young lawyer was Assistant District Attorney . Had a chance of being Governor someday . Moriarity had dreamed of saying , " Me son-in-law , the Governor ... " As the years went by , he was convinced she 'd never marry . Well , there were compensations in that , too . He could count on her to grow old devoted to him ; to attend to his well-being if his wife died before him . That dream had gone now . And he wept for that . But fundamentally he wept because he knew his daughter was sweet and good and honest . She was too good  --  much too good  --  for someone like Patrick Dennis Moore . That almost broke his heart . They ate supper together . It was a sad wedding feast . No one knew what to say and everyone was apprehensive of Biddy , who served them with poor grace , banging the dishes down and mutteringto herself . After supper , they went upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike sat in morose silence while Patsy and the two women tried to make conversation . The Missus asked Mary to play the piano . She requested " Over the Waves . " Mary said her fingers were too stiff from the chill of the room . Then her fatherp69broke his silence and asked her to play " Molly Malone . " Because she wished to ingratiate herself with him , she played a chorus of the ballad , then closed the piano . They sat there . The evening wore on . The Missus dozed in her chair . Black shadows appeared under Mary 's eyes . Patsy began yawning and got The Boss to yawning , too . No one wanted to be indelicate enough to suggest going to bed . Finally Patsy took charge of the situation . He got up , stretched his arms and yawned . " I 'm going to bed , " he said . " I 'm that tired . " He held out his hand to his wife . " Come , Mary . " Hand in hand they went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Mike . " To me room , " said Patsy . " Over the stable . " Mike stood up . " Me daughter was n't raised to sleep in a stable , " he said . " Neither was my husband , " said Mary . " Michael , " said The Missus timidly , " surely in this big house there is a room ... " " We 'll sleep in my room , " said Mary . The two women stood silent , waiting for Mike 's outburst . He said nothing . Patsy went to The Missus . " Good night , me sweet mother , " he said . He kissed her cheek . The Missus beamed and gave him a fierce , loving hug . " Good night , " he said to Mike and held out his hand . Mike ignored it . Mary kissed her mother , then went to her father , put her arms around his neck and rested her head on his chest . " Oh , Papa , " she said , " I 'm so happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stroked his daughter 's hair with one hand and held out his other hand to his son-in-law . " Be good to this good girl , " he said to Mary 's husband . Later , they were married by a priest . The Missus did n't want them to be married in the neighborhood parish . She said they were too well known and people would think it was " funny "  --  her daughter being married without a veil or bridesmaid or Nuptial Mass . They were married in the adjoining parish of Williamsburg byp70Father Flynn , a priest newly come to the neighborhood . He was very nice to them . The marriage disrupted the household . Biddy announced it was beneath her to wait on an ex-servant even if he had married The Boss 's daughter . She turned in her notice and they had to break in a new servant girl . And The Missus and Mary decided it was not becoming for a member of the family to be a stable boy . Patsy agreed with them . Mike had to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and odorous chores . Mary lost her teaching job when she married . Married women were not permitted to teach in the public schools . Therefore , Mike had to support Patsy and Mary and pay a new stable boy in the bargain . Patsy hung around the house all day smoking his pipe of clay and picking out " Chopsticks " with two fingers on the piano . He was very loving to Mary and courtly to his mother-in-law . Both women worshiped him . The Missus bloomed under Patsy 's attentions and she stopped scuttling for a while . He called her " Mother , " which thrilled her . He stopped addressing Mike as " Sir . " He called him " Hey , Boss ! " which irritated Mike . Patsy got things out of Mike by using Mary 's name . Mike referred to this process as " bleeding me white . " " Hey , Boss , me wife says ... " " You mean , me daughter says . . . " " Me wife says I need a new suit . Me wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way me backside is showing through me pants  --  they is that worn out . And the way me bare feet is on the ground for want of soles on me brogans . So . . . " So Mike bought him new clothes . If Mary knew her husband was using her to get things from her father , she never said a word about it . " Me wife . . . " " Me daughter ... " " Me wife says I 'm getting to be a reglar mully-cuddle the way I sit in the house day and night with only wimmen folks . Be like me father , ' says me wife . Have the grand life like me dear father and he amongst the men all day . ' "  | " Me daughter do n't talk that way . " " Them was her words . Take a night off once a week , ' she says , and stand up to the bar with the boy-sis and have your schooner of cool beer . Or two . ' " So The Boss gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . One night , six months later , The Boss and his Missus were preparing for bed . She scuttled into the double brass bed and lay tight against the wall to displace as little space as possible . He sat down on the side of the bed to pull off his congress gaiter shoes . His weight made her bounce up and down once or twice . As usual he was complaining about his son-in-law . ( During the day , about the house and also in public , she seemed frightened of him and he never spoke to her without shouting or without sarcasm . But at night , in the privacy of the room and bed they had shared for thirty years , they turned into congenialcompanions . ) " Me patience is used up , Molly , " he said . " Out he goes as soon as she has the baby . " " What baby , Micky ? " " Mary 's . And , " he added grudgingly , " his'n . " " Oh , they 're not going to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . You told me that Biddy told you . She told you that she saw them two nights before they was married . And they was intimate . " " Oh , Micky , you know what a liar Biddy always was . " He sat there aghast , holding a shoe in his hand . " So I 've been thricked into this marriage ! And that 's how the durtee cuckoo got into me clean nest ! " " Say your rosary and come to bed , Micky . " " I got to find some way of getting him out of me house . But how ? " " You could get him a job and give them a house to live in . That 's how . " " Hm . That 's not a bad idear , Molly . I 'll start thinking on it tomorrow . " He got into bed . " Now where 's me beads ? " " Under your pillow like always . "  |p72Moriarity  pulled wires and cut red tape and bribed and blackmailedand got his son-in-law a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted his son-in-law on garbagecollecting . He was tempted to say yes , but he knew he could n't push Patsy that far . So he got him a job as street cleaner . Then he gave his daughter and her husband a house of their very own to live in . Among Mike 's holdings was a two-family frame house in Williamsburg on what was then known as Ewen Street . Fifteen years before , Mike had bought it for five hundred down and a first mortgage of three hundred and a loan of two hundred . This was in the years when property was still cheap . In those old days , the plumbing was an outhouse in the yard , people drew water from a community pump down the street , the lighting was from kerosene lamps and heating came from a cooking range in the kitchen and a " parlor " stove in the front room . Recently gaslight and water had been installed in the house . Mike had taken a small woodshed attached to the house and made it into a bathroom of sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet and wash bowl . Upstairs , a toilet had been put into a bedroom closet and a sink in the kitchen . Mike had paid off the two-hundred-dollar loan and then turned around and gotten a thousand-dollar mortgage on the " improved " house . The upstairs flat rented for fifteen a month and the downstairs for twenty . One half or the other was usually without tenants . Mike made no attempt to pay off the thousand-dollar mortgage . He simply paid the interest and kept " renewing " the mortgage . The taxes were still low . Since he put no money into improvements , the rent was a decent little profit on his original **28;116;TOOLONG . This was the house he turned over to his daughter and her husband . He made a little speech when he turned over the deed ending up with : " ' T is your very own , now . " The mortgage and the unrented upstairs apar anent were their very own , too . Mary got a woman in for a day to help her scrub and clean up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching job and Patsy had nearly a hundred . They had the rooms up/stairs and downstairs cheerfully papered and the woodwork painted . Mary was allowed to take the bedroom furniture from her room at home and she and Patsy bought what additional furniture was needed . She made muslin curtains for the windows and set up her hand-painted china plates on the shelf that ran the length of the kitchen wall . She was able to rent the upstairs apartment soon after they had taken over the house . She made it very plain to Patsy that the rent was to be used entirely for taxes and mortgage interest and payments on the mortgage itself . Mary liked her little home but Patsy did n't like it one bit . To Mary , it was a great adventure  --  creating a home of their own . Patsy liked the brownstone house on Bushwick Avenue much better . He liked that neighborhood and he had liked not working while living there with Mary . He hated his job . Nearly every evening , he visited his father-in-law and complained about everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than as his , Patsy 's , wife . " ' T is a disgrace that your only daughter has to live in that cellar with a winder in it that you name a home . T is a shame that a high-toned woman like your daughter has a husband who has to shovel horse manure all day to support her . " " Stop your bellyaching , me boy , " said Moriarity . " Times is hard and men is out of work and banks is closing down . But let me tell you : I figured it out . The country is sound . " " I read that too , " said Patsy . " In last night 's World . " " They say there 's a panic on , " said Mike . " But what 's that to a man fixed like you ? You got a house to live in . Nobody can take that away from you . You got a city job . Ca n't be sacked . You get your pension when you retire . And your wife gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Patsy . He waited but Mike did n't second the motion by an " amen " or by knocking on wood . " Say ! Did me daughter take her money out of the bank like I told her ? " " We took our money out . Yes . " " That 's good because your bank closed this morning . " " We only had eight dollars in it . She , I mean , we , paid the interest and some of the taxes just last week and eight dollarsp74was all was left . And you , " asked Patsy shrewdly , " was you lucky enough to get all yours out before your bank closed up ? " " That I did . And in plenty of time , too . " " I bet it was more than eight dollars , " suggested Patsy . Would n't you like to know , thought Mike . He said : " Well , it was n't a forchune , but enough , enough . It 's safe under me mattressnow . If anything happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patsy : He did n't say " amen " for me when I said , " die , God forbid . " So I 'm not going to say it for him . " Tell The Missus . . . " continued Mike . " You mean me new mother ? " interrupted Patsy . You bastard , breathed Mike under his breath . " Well , just tell her that the money is in a old sock under the mattress . " Stubbornly , Patsy went back to his complaining . " I still do n't like to shovel manure  --  panic or no panic ; pension or no pension . " " It wo n't be forever . Someday you will be superintent ' and stand on the street in kid gloves making other men shovel manure . And sure , your house ai n't no marble mansion .... " " That can be said again , " agreed Patsy . " But ' t is only temporary against the time when you and me daughter get everything I own ; me big house and me carriage and fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sooner than you or me think . Me old ticker ai n't acting so good . " He pressed his hand to his heart . Patsy shivered because The Boss had not knocked wood when he spoke of his failing heart . Patsy had an impulse to knock wood for Moriarity . But he squelched it . Let the bastid knock his own wood , he decided.  |p75THE  way things turned out , Patsy and Mary were never to come into Mike 's fortune . The reform party won the next election , and , true to its platform , the new administration started the Big Cleanup . The bright , new District Attorney polished up his armor , buckled himself into it and went out after the grafters crying , " Corruption ! Corruption ! " all the way . Little grafters ran for their holes . Medium-sized grafters , like Moriarity , could n't find holes to hide in . The Big Cheese saved his rind , that is , his skin , by turning state 's evidence . Officious men came to Mike Moriarity 's house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had : his house and furniture and stable and horses and carriage and even Mary 's piano . Too late , Mike wished he had let Mary take it with her . The men busted open the locked door of his desk and attached deeds , notes , stocks and bonds . They even attached a couple of bankbooks stamped Account Canceled . One reformer , a plainclothesman , found Mike 's last withdrawal in an old sock under Mike 's mattress . The sock held two thousand dollars in small bills . The reformer pocketed the money and neglected to give Mike a receipt . Probably he neglected to turn in the money , too . The only things they could n't touch were the house that Mike had deeded over to Mary and Patsy , and a paid-up life-insurance policy in The Missus ' name . Moriarity , along with a dozen others , was indicted . It was in all the papers . Patsy , commenting on the indictment to Mary , said : " So I was never good enough for your father . So he always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's looking down on him , now . The thief ! " " Oh , Patrick , " she said , tears coming to her eves , " do n't call him that . "  |p76He  felt ashamed . Why do I say things like that to her , he thought . I get no satisfaction out of it . It makes me feel like Jack the Ripper , or somebody . " There now , Mary , " he said . " Who am I to talk ? Did not one of me own relations steal a pig in Ireland ? Yes . " She smiled through her tears and looked up at him with her hands clasped appealingly on her breast . " Did he , Patrick ? Did he ? " " Sure , " he said . " But he was a relation by marriage only . " So Mike was indicted for graft and corruption . But he never stood trial . Just before the trial , he had a stroke and his " ticker " gave out . It was nearly night when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark kitchen . Her face was pale and drawn . Patsy tried to find something comforting to say to her . " After all , he was your father , " he said . " Yes . " " And he was good to you . " " Not always , Patrick . I remember  --  I must have been about ten years old  --  when I thought I did n't like him . I thought he was n't nice to my mother and it seemed that he was always punishing me or scolding me . " One night , I suppose he got free tickets somewhere , he took me over to Manhattan to hear a singer . I remember it was snowing and everything looked so beautiful . I had a little white muff and tippet with ermine tails . There was an old woman selling violets on the street . I remember the cold , sweet smell . He bought a bunch and pinned them to my muff . He gave the old woman a bill and he would n't take his change . " He had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies ' back parlor , of course . My father introduced me to the man as though I were a grown-up lady . The man bowed as he shook my hand . He served me a big glass of lemonade on a silver tray . There was a tablespoon of claret in the lemonade to make it pink and a cherry on top . I thought it was wonderful . Papa and the man had a brandy together and talked about old times in Ireland.  | " The man had left the door leading into the saloon open and I saw it all . The bar was beautiful ! All the shining cut-glass decanterson the shelves with silver stoppers and glasses as thin as bubbles and that big mirror over the bar with a filigreed brass frame and oh , the chandelier with cut-glass crystals , or do they call them prisms ? It was so beautiful with the gas lights in ruby bowls here and there ... . " Then we went to the concert . I do n't remember now what the lady sang , except her encore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Papa take out his handkerchief and wipe his eyes . " After the concert we were walking down to the cab stand and there was this little store still open . They sold trinkets and things . Papa took me in and told me to pick out a little bracelet or a locket . But there was a pair of side combs in the showcase . They were tortoiseshell and all full of rhinestones . I could n't stop looking at them . " Papa said , You know you 're too little to wear them and they 'll be out of style by the time you grow up . Now here 's a nice little locket . It opens . . . . ' But I could n't take my eyes off the combs . " Then Papa said : You know you ca n't wear them . What do you want them for ? ' I said I did n't know . Then he said : You want them just to have them , do n't you ? ' I said , yes , and he told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father that night . I loved him so much I did n't know what to do . " That was the only time he ever took me out . Well , there came times after that night when I felt I did n't like him very much . When I got that feeling , I 'd go and take the combs out of the tissue paper and hold them and I 'd feel the same love I felt that night when he took me to the concert . " After the funeral , The Missus took her insurance money and went to Boston to live out her days there with Henrietta , her widowed sister . Patsy was sorry to see her go . This contrary man really loved his mother-in-law . " She 's like me own mother was , " Patsy told his wife . " She sees no fault in me. "  |p78Well  , after the reform administration cleaned out all the Tammanygrafters , they put in their own grafters . Once more , tithes were collected from the brothels . Once again , small storekeepers paid " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor Jewish merchants whose pushcarts lined both side of the curbs on Moore , Siegal and McKibben Streets , paid protection " rent " against their pushcarts being overturned and the merchandise trampled in the dirty gutters . The rent was fifty cents a week but often the grafters settled for a quarter . The citizens did n't like the new administration . They stood around on corners and in the saloons and sat on where grass should have been in the public parks and knocked the reformers . " It stands to reason : Where there is politics , there 's graft . Right ? " " Right . " " So we expect graft no matter what party 's in . Right ? " " Right . " " But when Tammany collected graft we got something back out of it . " " That 's right . " " Yeah . Like they ran block parties for us and paid the band . " " And they ran free excursions up the Hudson and everything on the house . " " Sure . " " Take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg . Why , they sent over a basket of groceries every week . " " Take this guy : I forgot his name . They paid to bury him when he died with no insurance and his wife was afraid she 'd have to plant him in Potter 's Field . " " Why sure ! Many 's the ton of coal they gave me that hard winter when I could n't get work . " " Well , this here party what 's in now takes graft but what do we get out of it ? " " Nothing . Just plain nothing . " So when the time came , these complaining citizens went to the polls and voted out the reform party and got the old ticket back in again . And some of them were so anxious to get Tammany back in again that they voted two or three times the way they had been taught to do by the Machine.  |p79Well  before this time , Patrick Dennis Moore put away all his dreams and hopes . He hated his job but would n't dare give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was grudgingly grateful that he was working for the city and could n't be laid off because times were hard . He realized , now , that he would always be a street cleaner . That was all he had to look forward to . He would always have to live in the shabby house on Ewen Street . His last dream had died out when his mother-in-law went to live with her sister in Boston  --  instead of with him and Mary  --  and took all her insurance money with her . CHAPTER TWELVE " : MARY kept the upstairs rented and banked the rent money and used it throughout the years to keep the taxes and the interest on the mortgage paid up and sometimes she was able to pay a little on the principal . She was liked and respected on Ewen Street ( which , for some reason , was now called Manhattan Avenue ) . The neighbors referred to her as " that refined schoolteacherwhat 's married to that slob  --  you know . The street cleaner ? " Mary became friends with Father Flynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never criticized her and Patsy for having a civil ceremony first . One time when his housekeepertook a week off to visit a married daughter in Albany , Mary went to the parish house every day and cooked the priest 's food and laundered his collars and mended the torn lace on his alb . Thereafter , she visited him once in a while or he came to her home . They exchanged opinions on the news of the day and analyzed the rapid changes that were taking place that would eventually change the once dreamy village of Williamsburg into a city slum . They had something in common in that both were strangers in the neighborhood , she having come from the prosperous and fashionable Bushwick section , and he from the Middle West.  |p80Father  Flynn had been born and reared in a small town in Minnesota . He had been educated in Midwestern schools . At college he had excelled in sports : football , baseball , basketball , hockey and especially skiing . He had been popular with faculty and classmates . The time came , while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports and his no less dearly loved contemporaries and , as an ordained priest , to take up his life and his work in an alien place . His Bishop had said : " You 'll have your work cut out for you there . " It was true . It was a swarming neighborhood . Fifty per cent of the populationwere Irish and German with a few English and Scottish families . There was a neighborhood saying that the Irish and the Germans " got along good together . " Evidently this was so as there was a great deal of intermarriage between the Germans and the Irish . The Jews and Italians were called foreigners by the Irish and Germans , presumably because they were not Nordic . There were some Dutch families left over from the time when Brooklyn had been called Breuckelen . They were classified with the Germans . Because there were some similarities in the languages , Germans were called Dutchmen . Then there were Poles , Hungarians , Swedes , some Chinese who lived among bundles of laundry in rooms back of one-windowed stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Indians . They were of the Canarsie tribe and they made their homes in run-down , abandoned , onewindowedstores . The other nationalities looked down on them . No one believed they were Indians because they dressed like everyone else and did not wear feathers in their hair . They were called gypsies . There was a small colony that was hard to classify . They had their own small neighborhood within the larger neighborhood . All the men worked in a one-story factory , where , stripped to the waist , they stood in lurid firelight blowing their lives into long tubes with a glob of molten glass on the end , to make green beer bottles . They were loosely classified as Bohemians and referred to as Bohunks . To add to the confusion , the nationalities were split up among  |p81themselves  . The Jews , although of the same race and religion , had the patina of diverse nationalities . There were English Jews and German Jews ; Russian Jews , Polish Jews and Armenian Jews . There were dark-haired , dark-eyed nervous Germans and placid , flaxen-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lutherans . There were Protestant Irish and Catholic Irish and they were continually breaking each other 's heads over Irish freedom and religion and opinions of Great Britain . Also , there were the much-feared Sicilian Italians , who were always making vendettas against other Italians  --  the aftermath of some internecine warfare back in Italy 's history . Many a kid in the neighborhood was kept in line by his parents telling him that the Blackhand would get him if he did n't watch out . There were many churches : Roman and Greek Catholic and Russian Orthodox . There was a Polish Catholic church where the priest spoke Polish . There was the high church of England and the low church . There were Methodists , Lutherans , Presbyterians , Baptists , Unitarians and many other sects . All scattered over Brooklyn . The steamship companies dumped all races , all creeds onto Ellis Island . Many of the immigrants went out to the Middle West and the West and a few went South . But many of them settled in Brooklyn : first because they wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't have the means to go any farther . Whenever a few people of one sect got together , they built a church forthwith . There was a place of worship on nearly every block . There were temples or synagogues , twin-spired stone churches , modest wooden churches , a mosaic-domed church , a religious meeting place in a vacant store with a whitewashed cross on the window , a gathering in a hall over a beer saloon . For a while , a few people gathered in a tent set up on a vacant lot to worship in their own shouting way and to roll on the sawdusted ground in their religious ecstasy . And there were wanderingevangelists who stood on street corners angrily shouting out The Message . Brooklyn was truly the city of churches . There were so many races ; so many creeds and sects all huddledtogether in an area not more than a mile square . The peoplep82called each other names : Mick , Heinie , Guinea , Hunky , Polack , Wop , Sheeny , Squarehead , Bohunk , Chink and Greaseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really gypsies , niggers . Mary was of great help to Father Flynn . During her years of teaching public school , she 'd had pupils of many nationalities and faiths . She had a general knowledge of the habits , temperaments and customs of various races and religions through her contact with her pupils . Father Flynn drew on her knowledge . He was grateful to her for it . It made his parish work somewhat simpler . Although Mary loved her home and loved her husband , she was n't happy in her marriage . She was unhappy because Patrick did not love her . He was considerate toward her  --  as considerate as a person of his cynical nature could be  --  but he simply did not love her and she knew he never would . Withdrawn and sad after her father 's disgrace and death , and lonesome after her mother had moved to Boston , she turned more and more to her church , where she always found comfort . She went to Mass each morning and lit a candle daily to the Virgin Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been married nearly three and a half years when she gave birth to a daughter . She had a very hard time . It was a dry birth and she was in agonizing labor for two days . Her doctor told her not to have any more children . He told her that she was n't built for childbearing . His warning meant nothing to Mary at that time . She was so quietly and intensely happy . Father Flynn came to the nursing home to bless the baby and to pray for the mother 's speedy recovery . He gave her a small medal of the Holy Child to pin to her baby 's shirt . She said : " I have something all of my own , Father . A child to love and to care for . . . a child who will grow to love me. "  |p83Patsy  suggested that Mary name the child after her mother . " That 's nice of you , Patrick , but I do n't want to call her Molly even if it is a nickname for Mary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no grander name . " " No . " " Me mother 's name was Lizzie , " he said tentatively . " Elizabeth 's a good name . " " Patrick , I 'd like to name her after the one who sort of brought us together . " " Biddy ? " he asked horrified . " Oh , no ! " She smiled . " After that girl you liked so . . . you know , Margaret Rose ? It 's such a pretty name . And I 'm so happy that I have a baby now that I want to give her the name as a present to you , sort of . " She saw his eyes flicker when she mentioned the name . She did n't know whether it was from surprise , pleasure , anger or memories . " You will please yourself , " he said brusquely . " We 'll have to get godparents , " she said . " I do n't know anyoneand my few relatives are all in Boston .... " " I know the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man used to say , I know somebody what owes me a favor . " He had decided to ask Big Red . Why ? Who knows . Perhaps he thought Big Red would write Maggie Rose and tell her Patsy had named his first child after her and she 'd be pleased and sad and know that he still thought of her even though she had marriedanother after all her promises . Maybe , as he had told Mary , Big Red owed him something . And maybe it was because Patsy did n't have a friend in all the world that he could ask . He prepared for his visit to Big Red 's house by going to confession . He had made a vow : Might he drop dead if he ever set foot in that house again . He was sure God had n't taken that seriously but why take a chance on dropping dead ? Father Flynn was n't too easy on him . First , he gave him penance for the sin itself ; then more penance for waiting over three years to confess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter and Christmas . Added on was penance for over three years of routine sinning . Finally Father Flynn doubled the whole thing because he did n't like Patsy 's arrogant attitude whenp84he , Father Flynn , told him that under no circumstance must he miss Mass , weekly confession and communion again . Patsy spent two hours on his knees doing the penance . He took communion next morning and , feeling brave and pure , he set out for East New York . Lottie and Tim were very glad to see him and , to Patsy 's relief , no mention was made of their quarrel . Lottie wept with joy . " This is the first time anybody ever asked me to be godmother . I can hardly wait . " " ' T is a great honor , " said Big Red , " the asking me to be godfatherand the naming of the little one after me baby sister . " ( Baby sister , as proved by a picture Big Red had lately received from Ireland , had grown plump and matronly looking . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . But to Big Red she would always be Baby Sister . ) Father Flynn christened the child . Lottie gave the baby the traditional christening gift : a little locket with a chip diamond in the middle of a little gold heart . " Diamonds is for April , " said Lottie . " She looks just like me baby sister looked when she was born , " said Big Red . Then he blushed . " That was the wrong thing to say , " he apologized . " Oh , no , " said Mary . " I 'm pleased . I heard that your sister is very beautiful . " " That she is . " " The baby do n't look like nobody , " said Patsy coldly . " Just like her own sweet self , " said Lottie tactfully . " That 's right , " said Big Red , ill at ease . " Well , sweetheart , " hesaid to his wife , " I guess we got ta make a break . " " He always calls me sweetheart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , " said Mary . " And wo n't you come again to see us and the baby ? " " I 'd love to , " said Lottie . " Sure , " agreed Big Red . " Come often , " urged Mary . The three looked to Patsy to second the invitation . Patsy stood mute . " Well , like I said , " said Big Red uncomfortably , " we got to go . "  |p85After  they 'd left , Mary said : " You never thanked him , Patrick . " " Why should I ? He owes me . I do n't owe him . He owes me  --  the way he can never make up to me for what he did to me . " " Remember that , " she said a little bitterly , " the next time you go to confession  --  three years from now . " He felt a pang because it was the first time she 'd ever spoken unkindly to him . He knew that she loved him . He had never responded to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have it around  --  in escrow , as it were . She has her baby , now , he thought . And now she will take her love from me and give it all to the child . A few days after the baptism , a package for the baby arrived from The Missus . It was Mary 's christening robe , slightly yellow with age . Attached to it was a five-dollar bill and a note . The Missus hoped the dress would get there in time for the christening , and she would have come to see her first grandchild , only Aunt Henrietta was n't well and .. . " Some family , " sneered Patsy . " Would n't take the trouble to come and see the only child of the only daughter . " " Now , Patrick , " said Mary patiently . She knew Patsy was terriblydisappointed that her mother had n't come for a visit . She knew that he was very fond of The Missus . For the first year of its life , the baby was called and referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to evolve . Would it he " Maggie Rose " or " Pegeen " or " Magsie " ? In that neighborhood , few children were called by their baptismalnames . The formal name appeared or was used only for diplomas and registration and things like that . Sometimes foreignbornparents had trouble pronouncing a name ; sometimes the child nicknamed itself . A " Catherine " would be pronounced , " Cat-rin , " shortened to " Cat , " then expanded to " Catty " and finally translatedto " Pussy . " " Elizabeth " went into " Lizziebet , " to " Lizzie , " to " Litty " ( because the child could n't pronounce the z 's ) , and ended up " Lit . " Long names were shortened and short names were lengthened . For instance , many an " Anna " ended up " Anna-la . " It was Patsy who accidentally gave the baby the name she'dp86always be known by . One night as he and Mary were preparing for bed , he looked at the big one-year-old baby who was sleeping sprawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sleep nights , no more , " he said . " This bed ai n't big enough for the three of us . This baby now . . . " He paused , and then he gave her her name . " . . . This here Maggie , now , is big enough to have a bed of her own . " They got a crib for her . She cried the first night she slept away from her mother . Mary soothed her . " There , baby , there ! " The child bawled harder . " Hush , " said Mary . " Hush , Maggie . Hush , Maggie , now . " The child stopped crying , smiled blissfully , put her thumb into her mouth and went off to sleep . She grew up healthy , happy and loving . She was full of mischiefand cheerfully disobedient . The day long throughout the house it was : " Maggie , now give me those scissors before you stab yourself . " " Maggie , now mind your father when he speaks to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she became known as Maggie-Now . ; " CHAPTER FOURTEENMARY , never having had younger sisters or brothers , had no experience in bringing up a child . Her natural maternal feelings had been used in an organized way to handle thirty-odd children a day as a schoolteacher . She had a tendency , tempered by indulgentlove , to regiment Maggie-Now . Mentally , she reached for a bell each morning to get the child started . She organized the child 's day and was apt to give instructions as a schoolteacher would . " We will take our little walk now . " " Eat your nice lunch , dear . " " What story shall we read tonight ? "  | " It 's time for a certain good little girl to go to bed . " When Maggie-Now was three , Mary tried to teach her to read . Maggie-Now squirmed , itched , scratched , rolled her eyes and made spit bubbles . Mary had to give it up . " She 's intelligent , " Mary told her husband , " but she wo n't sit still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her behind long enough when she starts regular school , " said Patsy . " Besides , why does she have to learn everythingso quick ? Why , she ai n't housebroken yet and you expect her to read ! " " Do n't you believe in education , Patrick ? " " No , " he said . " I went as far as what amounts to the sixth grade in America . And where did it get me ? Cleaning streets . " But Maggie-Now was very precocious in practical things  --  like work . Even as a toddler , she dusted while her mother swept , insisted on drying the dishes when her chin was but an inch above the sink drainboard , tried to make up a bed , and asked constantly when she could cook . Her reward for being good was permission to grind up left-over meat in the food chopper . Her punishment when naughty was the withdrawal of the privilege of grinding the morning coffee beans . One day each summer , as she was growing up , her parents took her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride in the open trolley was grand and the boarding of the Long Island train at Brooklyn Manor Station was a thrill . The high point of the journey was when the train went over water on a wooden trestle . Mary held the girl 's arm tightly , admonishing her not to fall out , now . " Maybe the trestle will break this time , " said Maggie-Now hopefully , " and we 'll all fall in the water . " " By God , " said Patsy , " she wants it to break ! She wants the train to fall in the water ! " " Sh ! " said Mary . Maggie-Now had no bathing suit . She grew so fast from year to year that it would have been a waste of money to buy one each year for just one day at the beach . Trying to follow her mother 's admonition  --  not to be ashamed because nobody was looking  --  Maggie-Now undressed behind a big towel that her mother held around her like a limp barrel . She changed into ap88pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathing suit . She ran whooping into the ocean and plunged into the first wave with a scream of delight . She held onto the rope and leaped and ducked and squatted to let the waves break over her head and howled in pretended terror ( though flattered by the attention ) when a big boy dived and grabbed her ankles and tried to duck her . Mary and Patsy sat on the towel : she in her Sunday dress and hat , sitting primly with her gloved hands in her lap , and Patsy lolling on an elbow and , as was traditional with men , eying the women in their bathing suits , their legs in long , black lisle stockingsand the ruffles of bloomers showing beneath knee-length skirts . After an hour , Patsy went to the water 's edge and induced Maggie-Now to come out . She changed back to her dry clothes inside the towel . Then they had their lunch which Mary had brought from home in a shoebox : ham bologna sandwiches , hardboiledeggs , sweet buns and drinks , now warm , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a bottle of beer for Patsy , a celery tonic for Mary , and a bottle of cream soda for Maggie-Now . After the lunch , Patsy announced that he would take a half hour 's nap and then they would make a break for home to avoid the rush . Maggie-Now was given permission to walk up the beach and given strict orders not to take candy from anyone . She ran up the beach , leaping over outstretched and sometimes intertwined legs . She stopped to stare frankly at a couple lying on the sand on their sides and looking into each other 's eyes . Their faces were hardly an inch apart . The young man , discomfited by her staring , lifted his head . " Get a gait on , kid , " he said . " What gate ? " asked Maggie-Now . " She do n't get your drift , " said the young woman languidly , " Twenty-three , skidoo , " said the young man . " I getcha , " said Maggie-Now , pleased that she could speak their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on the Long Island , she sat between her parents and laved her hands in a paper bag of Rockaway sand.  | " You know what ? " she said . " I 'm going to make a wish on the first star tonight . I 'm going to wish that when I get big I 'll have a house right by the water and listen to the waves when I 'm in bed nights . And in the daytime , I 'll jump in any time I feel like it . " " I 'll make a wish , too , " said Mary . " I wish that all your wishes come true . " Maggie-Now hugged her mother 's arm . Obscurely , Patsy felt left out . If he could n't be in on their emotional closeness , the next best thing was to destroy it . " People what lives by the water , " he said , " always get rheumatismand their teeth fall out because they got to eat fish all the time . " " Oh , you gloomy Gus , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mary . " And we do not , " said Patsy with bitter mimicry , " talk to our father that way , in the bargain . " Mary knew how he felt . She reached across and took the shoeboxfrom his knees . It had Maggie-Now 's wet bathing clothes in it . " I 'll hold it , " said Mary . " It 's leaking through on your good pants . " Not long after this , Mary told Pat that she was going to start Maggie-Now in parochial school in the fall . " She ai n't going to no Catholic school and that 's settled , " said Patsy . " I 've already enrolled her , " said Mary . " Unroll her , then . " " Now , Patrick ... " " That 's me last word on the subject . She goes to public school . " He had nothing against the parochial school . He just liked to argue . He sat down to read the evening paper . Suddenly he jumped up with a great oath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't stand for it ! " Mary thought he was referring to the school . " It 's settled , " she said firmly . " What about Brooklyn ? " he shouted . " The school 's in Brooklyn , " she said , bewildered . " You know that . "  | " What the hell 's the school got to do with it ? Brooklyn ai n't no longer a city . It says so in the paper . Now it 's only a borough of New York City . " " Think how the people in New York feel . That used to be New York City . Now it 's only the Borough of Manhattan . Anyhow , Patrick , you ca n't do a thing about it . " " Oh , no ? I can take the kid out of parochial school . " " What good would that do ? " " It would let me have me own way for once . " He got up , grabbed his hat and threw himself out of the house . The saloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of Irishmen bitterly cursing the annexation of Brooklyn by New York . They blamed it all on the British . " And is it not the fault of England , " shouted a burly man in a square-topped derby , " and she bragging how London is the biggest city in the world and that making New York jealous ? And what does New York turn around and do ? She steals Brooklyn and hitches it on to make New York the biggest city in the world . " " But there 'll always be a Brooklyn ! " rang out a voice in the crowd . This sentiment was loudly applauded and wildly cheered . " Let 's all drink to that ! " yelled another man . They crowded up to the bar . " What 's yours ? " the bartender asked Patsy . " I ai n't drinking to that damn foolishness , " said Patsy . " On the house , " said the bartender . " I 'll have a double rye . With water on the side , " added Patsy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses aloft . " To Brooklyn ! " said the bartender . Before they could drink , another voice rang out . " Brooklyn go bragh ! " " Brooklyn go bragh ! " shouted all the men in the saloon . And a couple of men passing on the street stopped to holler : " Brooklyn go bragh ! " Maggie-Now attended parochial school . To Mary 's distress , her daughter was not the brightest one in the class . To Patsy 's relief , she was not the dumbest one . She was down near the bottom of the average kids . But the teaching nuns liked her.  |p91She  got to school early and stayed late . She washed the blackboardsand clapped the chalk dust out of the erasers and filled the inkwells . On Mondays , when the children had to bring pieces of broken glass to school to scrape ink spots off the floor , MaggieNowshowed up with a bagful of glass to supply the kids who had forgotten to bring their own . She spent her Saturdays collectingbottles and smashing them for that purpose . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually it was two bologna sandwiches . She always traded them for the three slices of dry bread a wispy girl brought for lunch , insisting that she hated meat and liked plain bread better . It was n't that she was sorry for the girl or overly generous ; she just liked to give things . " She is a giver , " sighed Sister Veronica to Sister Mary Joseph . " She 'll have a busy life , then , " said Sister Mary Joseph dryly . " There are ten takers for one giver . " Regularly , each morning at ten and each afternoon at two , Maggie-Now 's hand shot up in the air for permission to leave the room . This regularity irritated Sister Veronica . Once she frowned and said : " We had recess half an hour ago . Why did n't you attend to your needs then ? " " I did , " said Maggie-Now frankly . " Now I got to ' tend to my horse . " The class tittered . " Watch your language , Margaret , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie-Now with many a " Whoa there , " and a " Hold still , boy , " untied an imaginary horse from an imaginary stake . Then she became the horse . She ran about the yard , gallopingand prancing and snorting . Then she was a steeplechase horse taking imaginary hurdles . And lastly , not to neglect the humbler species , she was a junk-wagon horse in harness , straining to pull a load that must have weighed a hundred pounds . She was not above falling down in pretended exhaustion and death to give reality to her game . She bounced back into the classroom , windblown , rosy and glowing . Although Sister Veronica frowned when she left , she always smiled when she returned . She told Sister Mary Joseph : " She brings the smell of the wind back into the room with her . " She pronounced wind to rhyme with kind.  | " A pity you gave up writing poetry , Sister , when you took holy orders , " said Sister Mary Joseph . The rules of the order forbade any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another nun or a lay person . The nuns liked children to go shopping with them . Maggie-Now was much in demand as an escort . When she turned up at the convent on a Saturday morning , the sisters pretended to quarrel over who 'd get Maggie-Now . This thrilled the girl . Sister Veronica needed new shoes . Maggie-Now went to the shoe store with her . She knelt down and helped the nun try on the shoes . She kneaded the leather over the toes and asked anxiously : " Are you sure they fit ? Have you got room for all your toes ? " " You 'll wear them out , child , before I have a chance to walk in them . " Sister Mary Joseph wore a wedding ring , as did the other nuns , because she was the bride of Christ . Through the years , the ring had become too tight . Maggie-Now escorted her to the jeweler 's to have it sawed off . Maggie-Now liked Sister Mary Joseph but was afraid of her because she said unexpected things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nun 's hand and skipped along and chattered . With Sister Mary Joseph , she walked sedately  --  no hand holding , no skipping , no chatter . Maggie-Now had to stretch her legs to match the nun 's long stride . They had been walking three blocks in complete silence when Sister said in an ordinary , conversational tone : " What 's your horse 's name ? " The girl quivered and wondered how Sister knew . She gave her a quick look . The nun was staring straight ahead . " What horse ? " hedged Maggie-Now . " The one you keep in the schoolyard . " " His name is Drummer . " The nun nodded . Does that mean , thought Maggie-Now , that it 's a nice name ? Or does it mean that she caught me ? They walked another block in silence . Then Sister Mary Joseph said with her usual bluntness : " I used to play basketball when I was in high school . "  | " You never did ! " said Maggie-Now in instinctive disbelief . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why not ? " said the nun crossly . " I mean , I thought Sisters prayed all the time . " " Oh , we take a day off now and then to have a toothache or something . Just like other people . " " Nobody ever told me , " said Maggie-Now . " Margaret , are you afraid of me ? " " Not so much as I used to be . " Maggie-Now smiled up at her . When Mr. Freedman , the jeweler , began to saw on the ring , Maggie-Now threw her arms around the nun and buried her face in her habit . " What 's the matter , Margaret ? " " It goes all through me , " shuddered the child . " The finger , I will not take off , " promised Mr. Freedman . " Only the ring . " " Take deep breaths , Margaret , and be brave , " said Sister Mary Joseph , " and it will be over before you know it . " 2 CHAPTER FIFTEEN " MAMA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We do . " " Where ? " " Oh , Ireland . And you have a grandmother in Boston , you know . " " But why do n't I have sisters and brothers and aunts and uncles and lots and lots of cousins like other girls do ? " " Maybe you will have a sister or brother someday . And we might go to Boston and try and find some cousins for you . " " When are we going to Boston ? " " Summer vacation , maybe . If you pass your catechism and make your first communion , and if you do your homework and get promoted . "  | " Ghee ! Other kids have relations without passing everything first . " " Do n't say , Gee , ' and I 've told you that a kid is a baby goat and not a child . " " Sometimes you talk like Sister Veronica , Mama . " Mary sighed and smiled . " I suppose I do . Once a schoolteacher , always a schoolteacher . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . has a schoolteacher for a mama . " Maggie-Now waited patiently to be corrected on the " ai n't . " To her surprise , her mother did n't correct her , but hugged her instead . Mary took ten dollars from the bank and to her surprise Patsy gave her ten dollars more for the Boston trip . " Maybe you can talk your old lady into coming back to live with us . " " It 's nice that you like my mother , Patrick , " she said , " but it seems odd . It 's not your way . " " She 's never been against me . " " No one 's against you , Patrick . " " Oh , no ? " he said with a crooked smile . " You are against yourself . " He raised two fingers in the air . " May I leave the room , teacher ? " he said sarcastically . They rode the day coach to Boston . To Maggie-Now it was like a trip to the moon . As they walked through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , they speak English ! " " What did you think they spoke ? " " Oh , Italian , Jewish , Latin . " " No . English is the language of America . " " Brooklyn 's America . But Anastasia 's father and mother speak Italian , there . " " Many old people speak foreign languages because they came from foreign countries and never did learn English . " " What does Grandma speak ? " " English , of course . " " But you said she came from Ireland . " " They speak English there . " " Why do n't they speak Irish ? "  | " Some do . They call it Gaelic . But most of them speak English with an Irish accent . " " What 's a . . . an . . . accent ? " " The way people fix the words together when they speak and the different way they make the words sound . " " Mama , I guess you 're the smartest lady in the whole world . " The Missus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a grandmother was a woman with a high stomach and a gingham apron tied about her waist , gray hair parted in the middle and steel-rimmed spectacles . She had this idea from a colored lithograph illustrating the poem " Over the river and through the woods , to grandmother 's house we go . " But GrandmotherMoriarity was n't like that at all . She was little and skinny and wore a black sateen dress and her hair was coal black and she wore it in curls on top of her head . Henrietta was Grandmother 's sister and Mother 's aunt . MaggieNowwas instructed to call her " Aunt Henrietta . " She did n't look like an aunt . A girl on Maggie-Now 's block in Brooklyn had an aunt who was young and blonde and laughed a lot and smelled like sweet , sticky candy . Aunt Henrietta , now , was old and withered and smelled like a plant that was dead but still standing in the dirt of the flower pot . She heard talk of Cousin Robbie , who was coming over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a cousin in Brooklyn ; he 'd had shiny blond hair and wore a Norfolk suit with buckled knickerbockers , Buster Brown collar , Windsor tie , long black ribbed stockings and button shoes . She 'd been disillusioned about her grandmother and her aunt . She did n't expect Cousin Robbie to be wearing a Buster Brown collar . But did he have to show up baldheaded and fat and making jokes about his big stomach which he called a bay window ? He kissed Maggie-Now on the cheek . The kiss was like an exploded soap bubble . He handed her a square of blotting paper . " I always give out blotting paper with my wet kisses , " he said . He waited . No one laughed . " Oh , well , " he sighed . " I 'd do my rabbit trick for you if I had a rabbit . " Maggie-Now giggled . He gave her a quarter and ignored her for the rest of the evening . The three women and Robbie settled down to an evening of genealogy . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married Liza ... "  | " No , " said Robbie . " Pete died when he was three years old . " " I 'm sorry . " " That 's all right . That was thirty years ago . Adam married Liza . Let 's see , Aunt Molly , " he said to The Missus . " You married a Moriarity ? Mike ? " The Missus nodded . " I understand he died . " " Yes , " agreed The Missus . " That was some time ago , God rest his soul . " " Whatever became of Roddy ? Your wife 's brother ? " asked Mary . " Oh , him , " sniffed Robbie . " He married a girl , name of Katie Fogarty . I remember the name well because it was the same name he had . He was a Fogarty , too . Understand , they were not relations . They just had the same name . Well , sir , when they got the license , the clerk did n't want to give it to them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that ? " asked The Missus . " Oh , the baby might be born funny , " explained Robbie . " How was the baby ? " asked Aunt Henrietta . " They never had one , " said Robbie . " What finally happened to Roddy ? " asked Mary . " He moved to Brooklyn , where people is more broadminded , and , for all I know , he might be dead or still living . " The saga of Roddy seemed dull to Maggie-Now . Lulled by the rise and fall of Robbie 's voice , comforted by the warmth of the room and feeling safe surrounded by her mother , grandmother and aunt , she went into a half sleep . The conversation droned on . A word came up . A sharp word . A name . It kept piercing her drowsiness . " Sheila ! " " No good , " said Aunt Henrietta . Her voice was whippy and sharp , like a fly swatter coming down on a fly . " It was just that she had hard luck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if she was my granddaughter , " swatted Aunt Henrietta . " Took after her mother . " ( Swat ! ) " Aggie was no good . " " Let the dead rest in peace , " said Mary . " She was pretty , so pretty , " said Robbie . " The youngest , the prettiest of all my daughters . "  |p97Maggie-Now  was awake but she feigned sleep , knowing that the grownups would talk in a way she could n't understand if they knew she was listening . " The way she was pretty was the ruin of her , " said Robbie . " The boys were after her like bees after a honey flower by the time she was twelve . " He sounded the way people sounded at funerals . " She had a baby when she was fifteen , " swatted Aunt Henrietta . " She was married at the time , " said Robbie with dignity . " Seven months married , " swatted back Aunt Henrietta . " It was a premature baby . " " Like fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't tell me ! " " In Brooklyn , " said The Missus , " an awful lot of first babies are premature . The trolley cars shakes the houses and makes them nervous . " " Humpf ! " said Aunt Henrietta . " I remember , " said Mary , " when Aggie brought Sheila to visit us in Brooklyn , once . I guess Sheila was six or seven . And my , was she pretty ! Beautiful ! I 'd like to see her again . " " No , you would n't , Mary , " said Robbie . " She looks bad and lives poor . Where her man is no one knows . He shows up from time to time , though . She lives in a slum . And believe me , a Boston slum is something . She takes in washing and Lord knows how many children she has . " " I 'll go to see her before we leave Boston , " said Mary . " Not while you 're staying in my house , " said Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said The Missus , " and do n't tell Mary what not to do or she 'll do it , the way she got married when her father told her not to . " " Maybe it would be a good idea if she did go , " said Aunt Henrietta . " Yes , go , Mary , and take your daughter so she sees what happens to a girl when she lets the fellers chase her . Not that you got to worry about that , Mary , the way she 's so plain . " " She is not plain , " said Mary . She put her arm around the child . " She 's not pretty the way Sheila was with blond curls and dimples and pink cheeks . She 's handsome ! Look at those wide cheekbones and the way her chin comes to sort of a point . Why , she has a face like a heart . "  |p98Maggie-Now  opened her eyes wide and stared hard into Aunt Henrietta 's eyes , mutely daring her to contradict her mother . " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has not ! " said Mary . " She has golden eyes . " " Tan ! " insisted the old woman . " Now , Henrietta , " said The Missus , " they 're the same color yours were when you were young . " " She has golden eyes , " conceded the old woman . " I promised I 'd find cousins for you , Maggie-Now , and I will , " said Mary . " So be patient . Let me see . " She consulted Robbie 's directions on a slip of paper . " Turn right , go one block , no , three . . . " She lifted her veil because the chenille dots before her eyes made threes out of twos . " That 's better . Two more blocks ... " They climbed up four flights of stairs . Mary knocked quietly on the door . It was flung open with a bang . " Come in ! Come in ! " said a big woman . Her strong arms were bare to the shoulders . The front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond , half brown . Her face shone with sweat . The room seemed to be boiling with life . A whole mob of children ran for cover when the visitors entered . They hid behindbundles of dirty wash standing on the floor and the smallest one burrowed into a loose pile of soiled clothes , half sorted , on the floor . The window shades were up and the sun , full of dusty motes which seemed to quiver with life , poured in through the open windows . A network of filled clotheslines obscured the sky outside the windows . A breeze was blowing and the drying clothes billowedand collapsed and writhed and gyrated . The clothes seemed alive . There were bundles of dirty wash on the floor . The chairs were filled with clothes waiting to be ironed . A clothesline strung across the kitchen had freshly ironed shirts on it , and a bubbling boiler stood on the gas stove with the dirtiest of the wash boiling in it . " Mary ! " cried the big woman . She threw her arms around Mary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Mary , I recognized you right away . You did n't change . You stillp99look so sweet and so refined with your veil and gloves and all . " Then she noticed Maggie-Now . " This yours ? " she asked . " Mine , " said Mary . " We call her Maggie-Now . " " She 's beautiful ! " The big woman knelt down and put her arms around the child . " This is your cousin Sheila , " said Mary . Sheila ! Maggie-Now quivered in the woman 's arms . Words she had heard when half asleep came back to her . " No good ! " " No good from the beginning ! " " No good like her mother before her ! " Maggie-Now was confused . How could someone who was " no good " be so nice ? Maybe this was another Sheila . But no . She heard her mother say : " This is Cousin Robbie 's girl . Aunt Henrietta is her grandmother . The mother of Aunt Henrietta and of my mother is her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins . There ! " " Do I have little cousins , too ? " asked Maggie-Now . " You certainly do , " said Sheila . She called gently : " Come out , come out , wherever you are ! " No response . Then she hollered : " Come out or I 'll give it to you ! Good ! " They came out of the dirty wash . There were four of them  --  all girls . The youngest was two , the next four , the third six and the oldest ten . Sheila lined them up , pulling a dirty sock out of the four-year-old 's hair . " Kids , this is your cousin Maggie-Now what came all the way from Brooklyn to see you . " The four girls and Maggie-Now stared solemnly at each other . The four-year-old was wearing a thumb guard . She pulled it off , took two good sucks on her thumb and replaced the guard . All of the girls had tangled golden curls , heavenly blue eyes , dirty pink cheeks and dimples that went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore odds and ends of clothing which made them look like the illustrations of the children who had followed the Pied Piper of Hamelin . " Oh , Sheila , " said Mary , " they 're pretty . So pretty the wayyou were . . . . I mean , there you stand , Sheila , four times over . " " Oh , go on , Mary , I was never as pretty as my kids . Anyhow , this is Rose , the oldest , this one is Violet , the thumb sucker isp100Daisy and Lily 's the baby . She 's two . " " What pretty names . " " I call them my bow-kay , " said Sheila . " Why , they 've all got fingernails , " said Maggie-Now clearly . " Oh , Maggie-Now , " moaned Mary . " Oh , my sainted grandmother , " laughed Sheila . " Will she ever let up on me ? She told my father ... " To change the subject , Mary asked : " What are you going to call the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fern ! To trim up my bow-kay . " She nodded at Maggie-Now . " This the only one you got ? " " The only one . " " What 's the matter ? Did you marry a night watchman or something ? " She prodded Mary with her elbow and laughed . Mary looked a little apprehensively at Maggie-Now . Sheila understood the look . " Listen , kids , " she said , " why do n't you go play with your cousin from Brooklyn so Cousin Mary and I can talk ? " The kids stood rigid except for Daisy , who removed her thumb guard and took three big sucks . " Go on and play when I tell you , " yelled Sheila , " or I 'll give it to you . Good ! " Whooping like Comanches , the four kids dragged Maggie-Now away into the dirty wash . They bounced on the bundles and scatteredthe sorted clothes . They delved into the basket of wet clothes waiting to be hung on the line and belted each other with wet towels , screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , they knocked over the ironing board with a sadiron upended on it . The iron missed Daisy by about an inch . " Just for that , " shouted Sheila , " you 'll all get it ! " They lined up somberly . Then Sheila did a strange thing . She put her arm around Rose , gave her a walloping slap on the backside , and a kiss on the cheek at the same time . She did the same to the other three . They sobbed . And grinned slyly at each other at the same time , making the dimples come and go . " My turn ! My turn ! " demanded Maggie-Now . Sheila gave her the same , explaining to Mary : " I give ' em a slap and a kiss at the same time so they know they 're getting punished with no hard feelings . "  |p101Home  again in Brooklyn , Maggie-Now remembered her " cousins . " She spent her pennies on picture postcards to send to Boston . Her salutation was : " My dear Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn cousin . " Sometimes she got a card back , always written by Sheila . " From cousin Sheila and all her flowers to the one rose , Maggie-Now . " A few months after their return , Mary had a letter from her mother saying that Sheila had given birth to her fifth child ; a son . She had named him Joe . " Why , oh why , " wailed Maggie-Now , " did n't she ask me ? I would have told her to call him Chris . " " Why Chris ? " asked her mother . " Chris is short for chris-san-thee . . . you know what flower I mean , Mama . Then he would have fitted in the bouquet . " Her next card had the salutation : " My dear Boston cousins and Joe . " THE growing years of Maggie-Now were not unhappy ones . She always had enough to eat , although the food was plain . She had warm clothes in winter even if they were not beautiful . She liked her school days although she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught her although they were very strict in their discipline . She was well adjusted because she knew where she belonged in the social setup of her small world . She had a friend who had a hair ribbon for every day in the week . Maggie-Now had but two  --  one for Sunday , one for weekdays . On the other hand , another friend was too poor to have any hair ribbon . Her hair was tied back with a dirty shoestring . Maggie-Now was sorry she did n't have seven hair ribbons but she was glad she did n't have to use a shoestring to tie back her hair . As she grew older , she gave some thought to poverty and riches . Her mother had asked her to read Little Women , explaining thatp102it was a book about four girls who were very poor but happy just the same . Maggie-Now read the book and took issue with her mother . " How can they be poor , " she asked , " when they can waste hot potatoes to put in their muff . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even . And then they have a servant and their father has money to go away on . " " To some people who are , say , used to three servants , to have only one servant is being poor . Poverty is relative . " The word " relative " puzzled Maggie-Now . How could " poor " be a relation , she wondered . She did n't probe further into the meaning of the word because she was anxious to go out to play . The word came up later , in another conversation . One night , Father Flynn was paying a parish call and he , Mary , Pat and Maggie-Now sat in the kitchen having coffee . Mary , as always , was talking eagerly with the priest . He was one of the few people who made her articulate . Patsy was listening with outward respect because he had been brought up to respect priests , but he did n't believe a word Father Flynn was saying . " I came from a small town , " Father Flynn was saying . " Everyoneseemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starved . I had an idea , then , that poor people wore colorful rags and had rosy cheeks and danced all night to the music of a concertina . Those were my Francois Villon days . Later , I thought poor people lived in cellars and had lice and lived on hard crusts of bread which they stole from each other . I was reading the Russian novelists in those days . Why , I was quite mature before I knew that poverty , like so many other things , was relative . " That word again , thought Maggie-Now . The next day she asked her mother : " Why are some people rich and other people poor ? " " Yesterday , you wanted to know how big was the sky . And last week you wanted to know where the wind went when it stopped blowing down Ainslie Street . " " I mean like : Florry says we 're poor . Bea thinks we 're rich . " " Florry 's father makes much more money than your father . Naturally , she thinks you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out scrubbing for a dollar a day . Of course , shep103thinks that you , with a father who has a steady job , are richer than she is . " " It 's all relations , then . " " Relations ? " asked Mary , puzzled . " Relations . But different than my Boston cousins are relations . " " Oh , you mean , relative . Yes , like everything else , I suppose it is relative . " " What 's relative ? " " Oh , Maggie-Now ! How high is the sky ? " " I asked first . " " Well , say a man has only one dollar in all the world . Somebodygives him a hundred dollars . Another man has a hundred dollars . He 's always had a hundred dollars . Someone gives him a dollar . He 's just as poor as he was before . Now both men have one hundred and one dollars . But one is rich and one is n't . That 's relative , I suppose . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " To tell you the truth , I do n't know how to tell you . " " Did you live in a rich house when you were a girl ? " " Oh , dear ! " sighed Mary . " Well , people who lived in crowded tenements thought we had a rich house . But the Mayor 's wife thought our house was poor compared to hers . " " What did you think , Mama ? " " I did n't think one way or the other , " said Mary , trying not to get irritated by the incessant questioning . " I lived there . " " Why ? " " Do n't be silly . I lived there because I was born there  --  because my parents lived there . " " Did you like it ? " " Of course . I did n't know about any other home , you see . " " Did that make it relative ? " " Oh , Maggie-Now , please stop . I 'm getting such a headache . " " So 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a rich home was and what was a poor home . " A cell , " said the nun , " with a cot in it and a chair and a nail on the wall on which to hang a shawl , is a rich home if our Holy Mother and our Blessed Lord are there . A grand home , with thickp104carpets and velvet curtains and a golden harp in the parlor , is a poor home if our Blessed Lord and our Holy Mother are denied there . " Maggie-Now asked her father : " Papa , did you have a rich home or a poor home when you were a boy back in Ireland ? " " ' T is time you knew , " he said , " how your poor father lived . It was a poor house . Poor . Poor . The poorest of the poor . A oneroomsod shanty with a leanto where me bed was and me bed a bag of straw . And the neighbor 's starving pig sneaking in on cold nights and wanting to sleep with me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' T is not to laugh at the way the slanty roof came down to the ground where me head lay and me bumping me head on it every time I moved in me sleep . " And the black hole in the wall where the poor fire did n't keep us warm in winter but roasted us in summer when we cooked our food in it . And oh , the poor food ! The small potatoes from the starving ground and the rough , black bread burned on the bottom , and an egg maybe once every two weeks , and our Christmasdinner , a hen , itself , tough , and she being too old to lay . " And water from the well , and the well a cruel walk from the shanty on a cold winter 's morning and the bucket too heavy for a skinny boy . And no toil . . . no plumbing in the house a-tall and we using the woods in back of our shanty . " " I betcha you were happy there , Papa . " " Happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hated it and left without looking back once when the time came . " But he thought of how green the fields were in summer and the meadow flowers hidden in knee-deep grass and the lake that took its color from the sky or did the sky take its color from the lake ? And the way the brown , dusty road to the village looked so lazy in the sun . He remembered the good nights in the tavern with the men liking the way he danced . His mind went to Rory-Boy in the great days when they had been true friends . He thought of his fiercely protective and possessive mother . And oh , the dear sweetness of his Maggie Rose ! He thought of the idle , golden days of his youth and he wept in his heart . God forgive the lie  --  me saying I hated it so , he prayed . Remembering , he spoke with bitterness to his daughter ; hisp105darling 's namesake . " Your mother was the one raised in a rich house . Tell her to take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell her to show you the stable where your father laid his head nights . Look good at that rich house what should have been mine . . . ours . . . if that crook . . . " Ah , he thought , let the dead rest in peace even if he was a black'ard in life . Walking over to the old house , Mary answered Maggie-Now 's question : " Why did n't I take you there before ? Because the house is so changed and it makes me sad . " Yes , it was changed . The rooms on either side of the stoop had been made into shops . The bay windows were now store windows . One was a hairdressing parlor with intricately coifed wax dummy heads in the window . The other window showed only a swan , pure , white and immobile and with each feather in place . The swan sat proudly on a bed of swansdown . A card , dangling by a brass chain suspended from the swan 's beak , read : Genuine Swansdown Filled Pillows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was . Once . Now it 's stuffed . " " Maybe it 's still alive and they give it medicine to sit still . " " Now you know better . " The upstairs windows had a blank look . A card in one of them said : Rooms . The basement rooms had been converted . A swingingsign with a red seal informed people that a notary public was available there . A rooms-for-rent sign was attached to the notary 's shingle . Mary figured it out that the man who 'd bought the house was the notary in the basement . He was squeezing every penny of revenue out of his investment . She wondered how many transients had slept in her white room since she had left . She sighed as she thought of her piano once standing in the room that now held sewing machines , bolts of ticking and bags of down . The stable was now a separate property , divided from the big house by an iron picket fence . An unevenly painted sign over the barn door read : Pheid &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet lay on its side in the yard . A man , Pheid himself , was uncrating a pair of double , soapstone washtubs . A boy , a few year older than Maggie-Now , was helping the man . The manp106looked up as Mary and Maggie-Now approached . " Yes ? " he asked . " I used to live here when I was a girl , " explained Mary . " That so ? Well , a Eyetalian owns the house now . But I own the shop . " " Is that so ? " " That sign : Pheid &; Son ? Well , this here is son . Son Pheid . " He put his arm about the boy 's shoulder . His pride was evident . " I 'm breaking him in young . I believe in that , " he said . " I see , " said Mary . " Well , help yourself . Look around . " He went back to his work . " Where did Papa sleep ? " asked Maggie-Now . " Up there . That little window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chee ! " " After we were married , we lived in the big house , of course . For a little while , anyhow . " " Where is . . . are , all the snowball trees you said was always in the yard ? " " Someone cut them down , I suppose . " " I 'm glad I never lived here . " " Why , Maggie-Now , do n't say that . It was very nice before it was all cut up into rental property . It was good to live here long ago . It was cool and dark in the summer and bright and warm in the winter . " " Why did you all move away then , if it was so nice ? " " Well , your grandfather died . " " Why ? " " Oh , Maggie-Now ! It was his time to die . " " Papa said he died from being scared . " " Your father did n't mean that . " Mary knew this was a logical time to tell her of her grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather had been a thief ? But was he ? The others who had stood trial had been exonerated . And politicians still kept on doing the same things . No , I will not complicate her growing years by telling her . Patrick wo n't tell her since he has n't so far . She may find out when she 's grown up . By that time , his crimes  --  if crimes they were  --  will be softened ; faded and far away.  | " What did he die of then ? " asked Maggie-Now . " What we all die of in the end . His heart stopped beating . " " I 'm glad ... not that he died , " amended Maggie-Now quickly . " I mean I 'm glad I do n't have to live here . I like our own house  --  where we live now . And I do n't care if it 's rich or poor . " I 'm glad she 's got that settled , thought Mary . Maybe now she 'll stop using that word " relative . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all relative . " MORE wonderful to Maggie-Now , almost , than Christmas , the first day of summer vacation or the trip to Coney Island , was Memorial Day , called Decoration Day in Brooklyn , when her mother took her on the yearly trip to the cemetery . " When will it come ? When will it come ? " she began asking her mother soon after Easter . " You 'll know by the lilac bush in Father Flynn 's yard . Lilacs always bloom for Decoration Day . " And it was so . It was always a warm , sunny day with a sweet-smelling wind around the next corner . When Maggie-Now went to the baker 's for the morning buns , there was usually a customer there who confided to the bakery woman : " I 'm going to the cemetery in my shape today . " That meant it was warm enough to go without a coat . Maggie-Now and her mother went to the cemetery in their shapes . The girl wore her Easter dress and Sunday hat and Mary dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars go by , waiting for an " open " trolley to come along . They sat in the front seat so they could see far ahead . The car picked up people along the way until it was filled with people in fresh summer clothes . Most of the men wore new straw hats because DecorationDay was the official day to start wearing them . In no time at all , the car was out of the city and in the country heading for Cypress Hills in Queens County . Grass now grewp108between the car tracks . Daisies , buttercups and sweet , purple clover grew in empty lots . Bouncing Bet grew along the car tracks and seemed to be running ahead of the trolley . " It has another name , " explained Mary . " Soapwort . And it loves the tracks : car tracks , train tracks and wagon tracks . No matter where you go , you see it along the tracks  --  even growing out of cinders . " " Oh , smell that country air ! " said a woman in the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , it smells healthy , " said her companion . " I feel years younger . " Maggie-Now always remembered that warm , new-summer smell . It was like smelling buckwheat honey through warm dust . They got off the trolley and had to walk several long blocks to the cemetery . It was a beautiful walk . The stores had the summer awnings down ; red , orange , green-striped and scalloped . All the stores save a tombstone-cutting store or two were flower stores with the flowering plants outside on the sidewalk . New , shallow , white-wood boxes held a dozen plants each . The plants were in bright terra-cotta clay pots fresh from the kiln . There were geraniums , passionately bright and clear and perfectlyformed ; red , rose , pink , white and even fuchsia . Blue hyacinths , with white veins , looked like clubs . ( For some reason , the people called them " lilies . " ) Then there were pots of blue-purple ageratum ; a name no one could pronounce . Women asked the price of " them purplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal-looking ivy , and , for people with money , large pots of steel-blue hydrangea or coral-bell azaleas . The plants were sprinkled hourly and little rivers of water ran down the sidewalk to the gutters . The awnings made shade , and the damp sidewalks and the flowers fresh-smelling from their sprinkling , and all the flower colors , and the way everyone looked so excited and the beautiful , sunny day  --  all put together  --  were like a gallant gauntlet slapped across the cheek of death . Each year , Mary bought a geranium to plant on her father 's grave . She let Maggie-Now choose the color . The girl went into a state of ecstatic indecision . Mary waited patiently , knowing that in the end the child would choose the brightest red in the lot.  |p109Mary  , looking at the awnings and flowers and the smiling , eager vendors and the leisurely-moving people , said : " It 's just like Paris . " " Was you ever in Paris , Mama ? " asked the girl . " No . " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be thirty cents , " said the flower man , " and a nickel back when you bring the flower pot back . " Maggie-Now walked proudly with the geranium in the crook of her arm . She smiled at other little girls who carried potted plants and they smiled back . There was a tombstone place on one corner . Its yard was crowded with stone angels and stone books opened in the middle , large stone crosses and smooth stone blocks  --  all with smooth , blank spaces , waiting for a name . One time they saw a man sitting in the sun on a camp chair in back of the store 's yard . He worked with hammer and chisel , putting the finishing touches to a monument . A child with stone curls rested with closed eyes , with her cheek on her folded arms . Thick stone angel wings seemed to sprout from the child 's neck . The sculptor , noting Maggie-Now 's interest , said : " It 's for an only child . " There was another tombstone place a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think of me , do n't think of tombstones . But when you think of tombstones , think of me . Mary always stopped to read it as though it were something new and she always smiled at the message . A man , in business for himself , had a pushcart filled with wateringcans . You could rent one for a dime , but he asked a quarter deposit on a can . Only the foolish threw money away like that . People brought their own tin cans from home for watering purposes . Maggie-Now had brought her sand bucket for hauling water and the toy shovel and rake that went with it for gardening . They went past the Hebrew cemetery . The gates were high , like , Maggie-Now thought , three men standing on top of each other . There was a big iron star on top of the iron arch of the gate.  | " Why do n't they have a cross like we do ? " asked Maggie-Now . " Because it 's a Jewish cemetery . That 's their star of David and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross . I told you that last year . " They got to the cemetery and Mary nodded to the caretakersitting at the little window of the little stone house inside the gates . " A nice day , " said Mary . " Sure is , " agreed the caretaker . The cemetery looked like a lawn party that had gotten out of hand . It was crowded with women , children and even a few men . The young women wore light summer dresses and hats with ribbons and flowers . The older women wore whatever had been around the house  --  usually a black dress or a suit skirt whose jacket had been given to the Salvation Army years ago , and a shirtwaist . They wore hats that looked as though they had been hanging in the cellar for five years . In short , the older women " made do " and used new-clothes money for more important things , like  --  well , say food . There were three times as many children as adults . They ran , jumped , hollered , wrestled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tumbled about as though they 'd been spilled out of a bag . They were deliriously happy to be out of the dark , crowded tenement rooms and off the narrow , crowded streets , and away from the streetcars and trucks which made their street games hazardous , and to have this great , big , green beautifulcemetery to play in for an hour or so . Mary saw a boy chinning himself on the outstretched arm of a granite angel . " I would n't do that if I were you , little boy , " she said . " Okay , teacher , " said the kid cheerfully and ran away . After all these years , thought Mary ruefully , I still look and act like a schoolteacher . Imagine ! Everybody was sociable . One felt that even the dead were sociable . They had to be , the way the plots were so close together with only a footpath between the graves . And the way some graves held three departed people , one on top of the other , because few families could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , land was getting very scarce in Greater New York . Maggie-Now skipped ahead . She wanted to be the first to find the grave . " Here it is , Mama ! " she shouted . " Here ! " " Do n't scream , " said Mary . " It wo n't run away . " Mary took the sand bucket , spade and shovel from her net shopping bag and stood them in a row . She added some rooted ivy cuttings that she had brought with her . Maggie-Now set the plant at the end of the row of things . " Look at that trash on the grave , " said Mary . " Perpetual care indeed ! Why , they do n't even cut the grass ! " She lifted her veil over her hat and pulled off her gloves . " Well , let 's get to work . " Maggie-Now threw herself on her knees and furiously began raking the litter from the plot . A woman waved frantically from two graves away . When she could n't catch Mary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore . Yoo hoo ! " " Oh , Mrs. Schondle , " Mary called back . " Hello ! I missed you last year . " " Yeah . I was n't here , " said Mrs. Schondle , waddling over . Mrs. Schondle , a stout woman to start with , wore a black dress several sizes too large for her . The neckline gaped loosely , exposingher chest and the upper part of her breasts , which were already burned a lobster red from sudden exposure to the sun for a few hours , after a year of living indoors . She wore a lumpy black hat draped with thick black mourning veils . The hat had slipped down over one ear and the veils were hanging wild . This gave her beet-red , smiling face a **26;146;TOOLONG . " Yeah , I was n't here last year , " she explained . " Because my oldest daughter was down from Jamaica . You know . The one by my first husband ? She did n't want to come to the cemetery with me , being 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the stepfather . You know . Not the real father ? Anyways , I thought I 'd stay home with her being 's I do n't see her much because , " her voice dropped to a whisper , " I do n't get along so good with him  --  her husband . He 's . . . " she looked around carefully to make sure no one else was listening , " he 's a Prattisssent !  |p112One  of them kind , you know . What thinks every time a Catholic boy is born they bury a gun under the church for him ? " " That 's too bad , " said Mary . " Oh , I got my troubles , " said Mrs. Schondle cheerfully . " But you look good , Miz Moore . " " You look fine , too , Mrs. Schondle . " " Oh , I 'm the kind what never changes . I look the same like I looked when I was first married . Everybody tells me that , " she said . " But your little girl , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was a baby . " " They shoot up fast , " said Mary . " Too fast . You slave for them and sacrifice and the first thing you know , they 're young ladies and married . " A diversion was caused by a mother yelling at her sons who were playing tag and running back and forth over the family plot a few graves away . " Now , Frankie , " said the mother , " I told you before . Stop running over your grandmother . Do you want to have hard luck ? " In answer , the boys ran over the grave again . " All right , then , " said the mother reasonably enough . Then she hauled off and gave each kid a slap alongside the ear . " The next time you 'll listen , " she said . " Tsch ! Tsch ! " commented Mrs. Schondle . " The way children is brought up nowadays . No respect for nothing  --  nobody . Livingor dead . " She straightened her hat . It fell over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant your plant , " she said . " Say ! Your ive-ree 's growing good . Soon your father will have a whole ive-ree blanket . I wish I had luck with ive-ree . But it wo n't grow for me . " Hat bouncing , veils quivering , she made her way back to Mr. Schondle 's grave . Maggie-Now had the grave raked of debris . She had a little mound of trash . " Where 'll I put it , Mama ? " " Over there on that big pile where other people are putting their trash . " They pulled up the dry stalk of last year 's geranium and planted the new one . Maggie-Now made a dozen trips with her bucket to one of the nearby spigots . They planted the new ivy shoots . They commented on how well the last year 's plantingp113had taken hold . The final thing was pinching off six sprigs of the established ivy . Mary would root them in water , plant them and nurture them through a summer , fall and winter and plant them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stowed away , including the flower pot , in the net shopping bag . Mary and Maggie-Now went to sit on a nearby stone bench . They sat in silence for a while . Mary thought of her father . She thought of the passage of time . It is ten years , she thought , since we laid him at rest . And the combs he bought me more than thirty years ago are still new . Things last longer than people . " It 's time now , " said Mary . Mother and daughter stood by Michael Moriarity 's grave . Mary clasped her hands , bowed her head and said a prayer for the dead . Maggie-Now joined her in the amen . Mary took a long , last look at the engraved name , Michael Moriarity , and they took their leave . They walked over to say good-by to Mrs. Schondle . " You going for pot cheese ? " asked Mrs. Schondle . Mary hesitated . " Yes . " " Then do you care if I go along ? " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , Maggie-Now ? " The girl scowled . She had looked forward to the trip all year  --  especially eating alone with her mother in the restaurant . Now that Mrs. Schondle had to spoil it . " Say yes , " whispered her mother . " It 's only a white lie . " " Yes , " said Maggie-Now sullenly . " And smile . " Maggie-Now gave Mrs. Schondle a distorted grimace . " That 's awfully nice of youse , " said Mrs. Schondle . " It 's just that I do n't like to eat alone . I always got to eat alone when I 'm home . " It took them a long time to get out of the cemetery because Mrs. Schondle walked slowly and had to stop from time to time to get her breath and , besides , she liked to stop and look at things . They paused by the new graves ; a dozen or so  --  the dead of the week . The raw-soil mounds were still high . A couple of men were working efficiently and briskly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . They piled up thep114wire forms , pillows , stars , crosses and hearts . They sold these frames to the florists to make new floral pieces for new dead people . The men paid for the privilege of salvaging these wire frames . A group of little girls stood by patiently waiting for the ribbons from the pieces . They were of the neighborhood and they got their hair bows that way . The men gave the big girls the black ribbons , the in-between girls the lavender , and the little girls got the white ribbons . " Want a hair bow , girlie ? " said one of the men , proffering a lavender ribbon to Maggie-Now . The girl shuddered and squeezed up close to her mother . " No , " she said . " No , what ? " prodded her mother . " No , thank you . " The restaurant was across the street from the cemetery . It was nearly a block long with open doors every twenty feet or so . Inside it was dim and cool . White-aproned waiters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babble of voices rose and fell . It was very festive even though most of the women wore black dresses . They had barely seated themselves at a little round table when a waiter materialized and gave the table top a ritual wipe with his napkin . " What 's yours , ladies ? " he asked . " I 'll have pot cheese and chives , " said Mary . " And coffee . " " Make mine the same , " said Mrs. Schondle . " Only beer , instead-acoffee . And sour cream on the side . " " And the young lady ? " asked the waiter . Maggie-Now was about to open her mouth and order a piece of pound cake with chocolate ice cream on top and a bottle of strawberry soda , when Mary said : " She 'll have just a cream soda . " " But , Mama . . . " wailed Maggie-Now . " Never mind . " Mary pressed the girl 's thigh under the table . " You can have the nickel deposit from the flower pot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sighed Maggie-Now . Mary did some quick figuring . She had fifty cents for her  |p115lunch  and Maggie-Now 's , a nickel tip for the waiter , ten cents carfare home and ten cents for emergencies . She had enough money to be sure , but four years ago , the time she had lunched with Mrs. Schondle , the poor woman had been fifteen cents short and Mary had had to pay it . Fearing another emergency like that , she held back on Maggie-Now . The waiter brought the food and , to nobody 's surprise , an extra plate and fork for Maggie-Now . He was used to people ordering and saying the child did n't want anything and , after the food was served , being requested to bring an extra plate and fork . So he brought the extra plate and fork along with the order to save time . Mary divided her pot cheese and chives with Maggie-Now . " She can have some of mine , " said Mrs. Schondle , reluctantly pushing her bowl toward Maggie-Now . " Oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " said Mary . " All right , then . " Eagerly , Mrs. Schondle pulled her bowl back . While the women talked , Maggie-Now gulped down her soda , dabbled with the pot cheese and let her eyes rove around the restaurant . She fastened her attention on a handsome boy at a nearby table . She stared at him and he stared back . Mrs. Schondle noticed this and said portentously to Mary : " It wo n't be long now . " " Well , you ca n't hold back time , " sighed Mary . " Just so 's she do n't throw herself away and marry somebody what 's no good like mine did . " " Oh , she 's got a lot of sense , " said Mary . Suddenly , Maggie-Now realized that they were talking about her and the possibility of her marrying . It made her feel important and mature . She threw back her head , half closed her eyes , and smiled languidly at the boy . His eyes popped for a second , then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers at her . Her face got red and she dropped her eyes to her plate . " I 'm never going to get married , " she said . " Because I hate boys . " " What brought that on ? " asked Mary . The waiter came and asked : one check or two ? " Two checks , "  |p116said  Mrs. Schondle . She explained to Mary : " Some would hang back and wait for the other party to pay . But I do n't sponge . I pay my way . " Mary put a quarter and a nickel on her check . Twenty-five cents for her lunch and a nickel for the cream soda . A little to one side , she put his nickel tip . " Carfare ! " he bawled over toward the bar . " Thank you , lady , " he said to Mary . Mrs. Schondle emptied her purse of all its coins . She took a nickel back for carfare . The waiter noticed she set nothing aside for a tip . He waited . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's all right , lady , " he muttered . Mary took a nickel from her purse and edged it over toward Mrs. Schondle 's check . The waiter scooped up the coins . " It 's just that a man has to make a living , " he said , as if in apology . " That 's the truth , " agreed Mrs. Schondle . " Only I left all my other money home . " Mary and Maggie-Now were going one way and Mrs. Schondle another . So they said their good-bys outside the restaurant . Mary took the woman 's hand in hers and pressed it warmly . " Good-by , Mrs. Schondle . " " You 're so nice , " said Mrs. Schondle . Tears came to her eyes . " So nice to me . " " We 'll see you next year , God willing , " said Mary . " Likewise , " said Mrs. Schondle . " So long , Miz Moore . And girlie . " She leaned over to pat Maggie-Now 's cheek . She said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night . " They watched her as she walked away from them down the street . She did look a bit like a ship with her hitching walk and the veils floating out behind like black smoke . " Who is she anyhow , Mama ? " " You know . Someone I met at the cemetery years ago ? We 're Decoration Day friends . " " Where does she live ? " " I do n't know . " " Does she have a little girl , home ? " " If she has , she 's never mentioned her . " " Did she get a new husband after Mr. Schondle died ? "  | " I never asked . " " How can you be friends with somebody and you do n't know where they live or anything ? " " It 's possible to be acquaintances without knowing much about the other person . We 're passing friends . " " Ha ! Ships that pass in the night , hey , Mama ? " IN THE fifteen-odd years since Patrick Dennis Moore had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The horsecars had given way to trolley cars . The completion of the subway , which changed into the elevated as soon as it crawled out onto the Williamsburg Bridge , did away with most of the East River ferries . Automobiles were no longer a curiosity , although some retarded kids still yelled , " Get a horse ! " when one appeared , and all pedestrians were delighted when a car broke down . Most of the better stores had soldered off the gas pipes and put in electric lights . Some of the candy stores had phones in and you got your number by appealing to " Central . " And some insane person went around the neighborhood saying he 'd sat in a dark room somewhere and saw pictures that moved on a bed sheet . The ballad writers of the day started a new folk lore by acknowledging the inventions in their creative work . Come , Josephine , In my flying machine .. . And , ... Lucille , In my merry Oldsmobile . Also , Call me up some rainy afternoon , And we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were changes . But Patsy never changed , except that he was getting too old to be called Patsy and the few people who had to speak to him called him Pat . He got to be sort of a characterthe way he smoked his stub-stemmed pipe upside down as he cleaned the streets . He smoked it that way so sparks would n't fly in his eyes on a windy day and to keep the tobacco dry on rainy days . He became known as " Deef Pat " because he would n't get out of the way for anybody or anything . Motormen would stamp down on the gong , motorists would squeeze the rubber bulb of the horn or grind the klaxon , bicycle bells would tinkle hysterically ; teamsters cursed him and pedestrians threatened to sue the city because he swept dust on them when they crossed the street . But he ignored them all , pretending not to hear , and he would n't move out of the way until he had finished the place he was cleaning . People would say to each other : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer : " Let 's hope so . " Out of boredom , Pat worked up a feud with a certain motorman . The motorman was a skinny , nervous little fellow and Pat was the one who could bring him to the brink of hysterics . When Pat saw the trolley coming , he 'd go and stand on the tracks pushing his broom back and forth . The car bore down with gong clattering . Pat paid no attention . Each time the motorman kept coming , thinking Pat would get off the tracks this time , and he would n't slow down . He was forced to put the brakes on at the last moment to bring the car to a screeching stop . Some passengers were knocked out of their seats , old ladies whimpered and the trolley pole slipped off the power line . The motorman would scream , scold , wave his arms and throw his cap on the ground and stamp on it but Pat would n't budge until he 'd finished his leisurely sweeping . One day , Pat held up a brewery truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Percherons , whose thick tails were braided and looped up to look like thick clubs . Pat stepped in front of the approaching truck , forcing the teamster to pull up and wait while he swept away non-existent dirt . Then he wanted the teamster to back up so he could sweep where the horses were standing . The teamster gave him an argument and Patp119walked back to the truck . In talking and waving his broom for emphasis , he happened to hit one of the horses on the rump with the broom handle . The horse shifted his great weight from one hind foot to the other like a woman shifting her hips , and swung his clubbed tail in Pat 's face . Pat 's clay pipe was knocked out of his mouth and broke into bits on the cobblestones . The teamster laughed so hard he nearly fell off his seat . Pedestrians laughed as Pat ran down the street after his rolling helmet . All agreed that it served Deef Pat right . The vindicated teamster went on his way . Soon after , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to take out his humiliation on the motorman . Other times , Pat had pretended there was debris on the tracks . This time he put it there . He emptied the entire contents of his trash can on the tracks . The motorman plowed into the trash before he could get the car stopped . A woman screamed , a child fell off the seat and , of course , the pole came off the line . The motorman did not act true to form . He was calm and collected . He soothed his passengers , swung off the car , put the pole back on the line , walked slowly up to where Pat was standing and punched him right in the nose . The passengerscheered and bystanders applauded the brave motorman . Pat threw himself upon the man and grappled with him . They rolled in the horse manure and other debris of the can . They rolled almost under the car . Their faces were inches apart . Pat took a good look at the motorman . " Well , I 'll be damned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And ' t is you , me old night-school friend , " said Mick Mack sadly . " And ai n't you the one to torment an old friend so . " " I did n't know it was you . T is the teeth make you look different . You did n't have teeth in night school . " " I bought them . Upper and lower and I 'm still paying on them . Tell me this , Pathrick : Did you ever take out your first papers ? " " I been a citizen these many years . " In the meantime , a passing citizen , not having seen the beginning of the fight , ran and told a policeman that two men had been run over by a trolley car . The panting policeman , who had run all the way , stooped and peered under the car to see howp120much they were mangled . He saw them lying side by side in the muck talking amiably to each other . He prodded Pat with his nightstick . " Come out of there , now , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamefaced before him . " I 've a mind to run you in . Drunk on the job , the both of yez , and layin ' in the gutter together . And you , " he said to Pat , " working for the city , too ! " He took their names and numbers . It ended up that Mick Mack was transferred to another run and Pat was suspended for two weeks without pay . During those two weeks , he roamed the streets of Williamsburg , Greenpoint and Maspeth , trying to find Mick Mack . He angered many a motorman by standing on a corner and holding up a finger as a signal that he wanted to board the car . When the car stopped , instead of getting on , he peered into the motorman 's face and said , " Wrong car . " I 'll look till I find him , Pat vowed . Then I 'll give him the licking of his life for daring to punch me in the nose . In truth , though , he wanted to find him because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little fellow had looked up to him in the old night-school days when they were both so young . He must have looked into a hundred cars , but he never found Mick Mack . In spite of being warned by his superintendent that he 'd be fired if he caused any more trouble , Pat did not change his ways . He continued to smoke his pipe upside down and to pretend to be deaf . He continued to hold up vehicles at whim . Teamsters and motorists took to going down other streets to avoid him and his nonsense . This lessened Pat 's work but it made him very lonely . There were fewer to hate and to torment , now , on the streets he cleaned . Sometimes on a still summer afternoon , when the German band played on one of his streets , he 'd lean on his broom handle and listen a while . The band played a German song , a popular song of the day and , invariably , an Irish song . When the tune had a lilt , Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind made a dance pattern and he thought again of County Kilkenny.  |p121One  day , Maggie-Now happened to be with the group of childrenwho followed the band from block to block . He watched his daughter waltz with another girl . She 's got them all beat , he thought with a flare of pride . After the usual lugubrious " Blue Danube , " the kids clustered around the musicians begging for " Rosie O'Grady . " When the band complied , the kids made a circle and pushed Maggie-Now into the middle of it . As soon as she got the beat of the song , she went into a solo , soft-shoe clog . The pipe nearly fell out of Pat 's mouth . He was that astonished . Where does she get it from ? he asked himself . From meself , he decided . But who learned her ? He watched her a while . No , I could n't do better meself . She lifted her skirts and the ruffles on her drawers showed . A couple of passing boys stopped , stared , whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and stalked over to the dancers . When Maggie-Now saw him , she gave him a big smile . " Go on home , " he said tersely . She tossed her head , making her bangs bounce , put her hands on her hips and clogged away from him . He followed her around the circle , caught her and spanked her . He spanked her publicly before all her friends . " That 'll learn you , " he said , " to show everything on the street . " She looked up at him , stricken . He had never hit her before . " Papa ! You did n't kiss me when you hit me ! You did n't kiss me like cousin Sheila ! You meant it ! " " You betcha life I meant it and there 's more where that come from . " He thought of Big Red  --  how he had said that and he wondered if Maggie-Now felt the same shame he had felt . He was sorry he had spanked her . He had never hit her before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . The spanking did n't hurt her , he assured himself . It was the public humiliation that hurt her . She ran home , weeping all the way . The comet player shook the spit out of his horn . " Du HeinzelMannchen ! " he sneered at Pat . " Is that so ? Well , Heinie , you go to your church and I 'll go top122mine . " That was one of Pat 's favorite retorts . Maggie-Now changed toward her father . The sunny child had always chattered to him endlessly , never noticing that he made no answer . She had liked to tease him and had been quick to hug him warmly . She had never noticed that he took all her loving ways with indifference . She had so much emotional steam that she could go a long way on her own power without the encouragementof response . She changed after the whipping . Now she was quiet and restrainedin his presence . She spoke to him only to answer him . She gave him respect and obedience and nothing more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost his child . " Are you turning the girl against me ? " he asked his wife . " I would not do that , Patrick . You are her father and she needs you and loves you . " " She 's still mulling over that spanking I gave her . I only gave her a tap or two but you 'd think I licked her black and blue . " " But why in front of her friends ? " " She 's got to learn , " he mumbled . " Did you learn anything by Timothy Shawn thrashing you ? No . You 'll hold that against him all the days of your life . MaggieNowhas some of your ways . " " Why do n't you say my bad ways ? " She took his hand in both of hers . " I loved you for your ways . I never thought were they good ways or bad ways . " " Ah , Mary , " he said , touched , and a moment tried to get born . I could say I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to her  --  my saying it . And I do love her in a kind of way . But I never said it before . Kinda late to start saying it now . I 'd feel foolish . . . we 'd both feel foolish ... . The moment died stillborn . He wanted the girl 's affection back . To that end , he made plans to take her out on her birthday . " I will give her a good time like your father gave you when he bought the combs . I 'll give her the same good time according to me means and hope she 'll remember it in the same way you did , " said Pat to his wife . No one sold violets on the Brooklyn streets . He bought her a pinwheel instead . When she ran ahead to make a wind to make it  |p123turn  , he realized she was too big to play with a pinwheel . Of course he did n't take her to a bar for a claret lemonade . There were no glamorous bars in the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought a little girl into a saloon . There was no fine restaurant . They ate hot pastrami sandwiches and honey cake and drank tea from glasses in a Kosher Delicatessen &; Lunchroom . The men ate with their hats on . Pat explained that was their religion . He took his hat off with the remark that they could go to their church and he 'd go to his . The diners balled up their napkins and threw them on the floor when they were done . When Maggie-Now asked why , her father said they did that because they were very clean people . Maggie-Now thought that did n't seem clean . Oh , yes , her father told her . That was so the proprietor would n't serve the napkins again to later diners . They went to the theater . They heard no prima donna raise a luscious voice in song . They went to The Folly and saw Marion Bent and Pat Rooney . And Rooney 's waltz clog thrilled them more than the best soprano 's aria . Afterward , he took her to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted a wood-burning set . There was a tie rack with an Indian chief 's head in a war bonnet just waiting to be burned and an envelope of " jewels " to paste on the bonnet'sheadband . Pat wanted her to have a rhinestone brooch . Both things cost a dollar each . She did n't want a brooch . She wanted to burn wood . Pat said she would take the rhinestone brooch or nothing . She said she wanted nothing . He bought her the brooch anyway . Yet it had been a happy evening and she held her father 's hand all the way home and squeezed it happily from time to time , and once he squeezed back.  |p124ONE  night as they were eating supper ( Maggie-Now was about twelve at the time ) , a handsome young man knocked on the door and was admitted to the kitchen . He was about twenty-three years old . " Do you remember me , Mr. Moore ? " The young man smiled engagingly , then his face saddened . Pat frowned , trying to remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember ? " Pat remembered . " Big Red 's boy , Widdy , " he explained to his wife . He thought : And what does the spawn want from me ? " Mother sent me , " said Widdy , turning his hat around in his hands . Then he seemed to lose the continuity of what he wanted to say . " I mean , you know Dad . " He swallowed hard before he said : " God rest his soul ... " " No ! " said Pat , putting his fork down . " No ! " " Mother said , I mean , Dad had no relations in America , except Mother and me and Grandmother . There 's Gracie , too . We were going to get married in June , but now we 'll have to wait a year out of respect . " Big Red had died in bed and had not been killed on the streets by hoodlums as Lottie had always feared . A blizzard had tied up the city . Big Red , like many another cop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had had a cold , and just when Lottie had thought he was getting well it turned into pneumonia . Yes , Widdy 's mother was bearing up well . There was pride mixed with her grief . Her Timmy had died an honored man , Widdy told them . His lieutenant would be one of the pallbearers , and Widdy supposed they had n't heard , but Big Red had been promoted to sergeant a week before he took sick . Lottie had been so proud . " So Mother said , " concluded Widdy , " if you folks would come to the funeral . . . the Moores and the Shawns had been so close  |p125back  in County Kilkenny . . . had almost become relations . . . " Pat grieved . He did n't grieve for a friend ; he grieved for a dear enemy . Although never a heavy drinker , he felt the need of going down to the saloon for a couple of beers . " I lost the best enemy a man ever had , " he told the bartender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bartender . He never flicked an eyelash . He was well used to hearing strange things from his customers . After the third beer , Pat found that he was lonesome for his other enemy , Mick Mack . He actually missed the little fellow . He had a feeling that perhaps Mick Mack was looking all over Brooklynfor him . Maybe he 'd been in that very saloon ... . " Listen , " Pat said to the bartender , " did a feller ever come in here with false teeth top and bottom ? " " Listen , Deef Pat , " said the bartender . " I do n't look down my customers ' moue 's to see what kinda china they got . I just serve them drinks . " Pat refused to go to the funeral , but he asked Mary to sew a black armband on his coat sleeve . " But that 's only for relatives , Patrick . " " And was he not a relative to me in a way , like the boy said ? I 'll wear it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral and went home afterward to Lottie 's house . Mary fixed supper for them ; Lottie , her aged mother , who was now living with her and Widdy , and Gracie , the pretty girl who was Widdy 's fiancee . Maggie-Now helped briskly . Lottie , who had n't seen her godchild since the christening , was much taken with her . She begged Mary to come again and bring the child . The friendship grew . Mary looked forward to her visits with Lottie . Mary had not realized how still her life was . She was well liked in her neighborhood , but made no close friends because she was not gregarious . Her life was sort of somber : partly because she had a serious temperament and partly because her husband was n't outgoing  --  he was not one to spread cheer and good will . If it was n't for Maggie-Now . . . Mary liked Lottie because Lottie made her laugh . She laughed at the things Lottie said and did . She relaxed in the great warmheartednessof Lottie . She listened sweetly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up : " And so we stayed sweethearts right up to the end . " To Maggie-Now , a visit to Lottie 's was like a Christmas present . The flat was a treasure house to the child . She loved her godmother the way she loved everyone . She fetched and carried for Lottie 's old mother . She beamed on Lottie and ran her errands . She romped with Widdy and admired Gracie extravagantly . Once Widdy took her to an ice-cream parlor and treated her to a soda . He told her he had done so in order to have the first date with her . Maggie-Now began to think about growing up . After Widdy married and went to live with his Gracie in Bay Ridge , Lottie did n't have too long a time to be lonesome . MaggieNowslipped into her son 's place . She started spending weekends with Lottie . Lottie fed her eclairs and cream puffs and neapolitans . She and Lottie did things together . They made Maggie-Now a peach-basket hat . They shopped in the dime store for the wire frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They trimmed it with bunches of tiny pink roses . Maggie-Now thought it was beautiful . Mary thought it was too mature for a child but she let her wear it to church just the same . Lottie told her bit by bit about her father : his dancing days in County Kilkenny , his mother , his romance with Maggie Rose and how Timmy had gone to Ireland and licked him . " Papa licked me once , " said Maggie-Now . " Right on the street in front of everybody . " Lottie gave her a quick look but she was too good and too kind to question the girl . Then she told how the immigrant boy had been robbed . ( All these things were new to Maggie-Now . Her father and mother had never told her these things . ) " There he stood , " said Lottie dramatically , " a young boy in a strange country , full of dreams of the grand new life where all men is free and any poor man has the chancet of being a millionaireor president  --  whichever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend , see ? And he trusted him and the man robbed him and all the time he thought he was his friend . " " That was awful , " said Maggie-Now . " Poor Papa ! " She told Maggie-Now what a wonderful heritage she had . She was not above exaggerating . To Lottie , the story was the thing  --  not the facts.  | " Your grandmother was a great lady and she raised your mother to play the piano . And she played in concert halls and oh , my ! How the people clapped ! " " Mama never told me ... " " She 's not one to brag  --  your mother . And she painted things . Not like you paint a house , but pictures and on dishes . You know . And your grandfather : My , he was a man high up ! He was the mayor of Bushwick Avenue or something like that . I forget . But he lost all his money and died . " " How did Mama meet Papa ? " asked the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Well , it was this way . " She settled herselfmore comfortably in her chair , preparing for a long story . " Bring your chair closer , Mama , " she shouted across the room , " You ca n't hear good over there . " In the first place , your father was a very handsome man . He lived in the stable in your grandfather 's yard . He did n't have to be a stable boy , mind you , but in America , everyone must start at the bottom . So , Mr. Moriarity , your grandfather , put him in with the horses to test him out . So ... " So Maggie-Now got to know a lot about her father . As she grew up , she came into a realization of how things that had happened to him in his young days had made him the man he was now . It can not be said that her growing knowledge made her love her father more , but it made her understand him better . And sometimes understanding is nearly as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . Love makes forgiveness a great , tearing emotional thing . Mary missed the child when she was away at Lottie 's . The girl was the sum and total of her life . She loved her so much that she sacrificed her precious time with her because MaggieNowwas so happy with Lottie . Pat did n't like it at all . He thought Maggie-Now was spendingtoo much time at the home that Big Red had set up . This Timothy Shawn , he thought . This Big Red : wherever he is , he 's still reaching out to manhandle me life . He came home one Friday night from work to a quiet house . " Where 's the girl ? " he asked . " Over to Lottie 's . " " Again ? I do n't like the idear . Here I use meself up working to provide a home for her and she 's never in it . " " It 's hard for a man to understand , but a growing girl needs a woman friend . Maggie-Now 's lucky to have Lottie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she be satisfied with her girl friends ? " " Maggie-Now has to know things , " she said fumblingly . " I suppose she talks to the other girls but they do n't know what Maggie-Now wants to know  --  needs to know . Now , Lottie is like a girl friend ; she and Maggie-Now do things together like young girls . Yet , she can talk to Lottie like one woman to another . Well , I guess I 'm not explaining it right . " " If you mean , " he said bluntly , " that she 's got to know where babies come from , you tell her . You 're , her mother . " She searched for words of explanation . Her thought was something about destruction of innocence . But she knew it would sound schoolteacherish . She said : " Maybe I could . Should . But the way I am . . . the way I was brought up , the way I carried her for nine months before she was born . . . the way when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me so seriously .. . well , I guess I would n't know how to tell her .... " " Well , does she have to live at Lottie 's to find out what she would-a found out anyway in time ? " " That 's not the only reason I like her to be friends with Lottie . We all have to die someday and . . . " " That 's news to me , " he said . " I mean , I do n't think of dying . But like all mothers , I suppose , I worry , or did , about what would become of Maggie-Now if I died before she was grown up . Then I think that she 'd have Lottie and I do n't worry any more . " He had a flash of tenderness . . . or was it jealousy ? " Think of me a little , " he said . " What would become of me if you died ? " " Oh , Patrick ! " she said . She clasped her hands and her eyesfilled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He did n't want to say yes . That would be too embarrassing for him . It would be ridiculous to say , no  --  churlish to say , I 've grown used to you . He was sorry he had brought up the matter.  |p129AFTER  sixteen years , Mary was pregnant again . She had a feeling of awe about it . She was in her middle forties and had believed that the menopause had set in . She was quietly happy about it and a little frightened . She remembered the hard time she 'd had when Maggie-Now was born ; how the doctor had warned her afterward not to have another child . It would be dangerous , he had said . Mary , however , reasoned that a lot of advances had been made in obstetrics in the sixteen years since she had had her first child . Also she 'd heard countless stories of women who 'd had a hard time with the first child and very easy times with the second and third birth . All in all , she was pleased about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more concern than curiosity . They discussed it . It was a changeof-lifebaby , they admitted , and , yes , them kind what comes late in life is always the smartest ones . Yeah , he might grow up to be a great man but she 'd be too old to care . Anyhow , was the consensus of thought , please God nothing should happen to her . Maggie-Now talked over the baby with Lottie . " I thought Mama was  --  you know . Too old ? " " Good heavens , no ! Lizzie Moore , your grandmother , was forty-five when she had your father . It runs in the family  --  to have a baby in middle age . " Maggie-Now could n't follow the reasoning . Lizzie Moore was not related by blood to Mary . How could Mary inherit the tendency to conceive in middle age from her ? " And you , Maggie-Now : When you get married and if a baby do n't come along right away , do n't give up until you 're fifty . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots and lots of them . " Lottie looked at Maggie-Now 's ripe figure . The girl looked older than her sixteen years . She could pass for twenty and no one would challenge her age.  | " Yes , " said Lottie . " You 'll have ' em . Only make sure you 're married first . " Mary was four months pregnant . She went for her first examinationto Doctor Scalani . When it was over , she asked : " Is everything all right ? " He waited a little too long before he said : " Yes . " " But at my age . . . " she fumbled with the buttons at the back of her dress . " Turn around , " he said . He buttoned up her dress . " Tell me the truth , Doctor . Will I die ? " He unbuttoned a few buttons and buttoned them up again to gain time before he answered . " The first thing you must do , " he said , " is to stop worrying . Doctor 's orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a worried look on her face . He smiled at her . After a second , she smiled back . " Come back in two weeks . " " I will . Good-by , Doctor . And thank you . " " Good-by , Mrs. Moore . " She left . He looked around his office . It was a one-window store with living quarters in the back . There were half curtains hung in the store window and a row of potted plants that always seemed to need watering . His sign hung on a brass chain from the middle of the curtain rod : Dominick Scalani . M.D. A card in the window told his office hours . If one broke down the hours , it would be found that he was always in his office save when he slept or ate . The office was furnished with a davenport , on which he slept nights , a couple of chairs and a mission oak table . He could n't afford to buy magazines for the table so he put odd copies of the medical journal on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung over his rolltop desk . Next to it hung a picture of his graduating class . He was so obscure in the picture that he had penciled an arrow in the margin , the tip leading to his head . His patients liked to know exactly where he was in the group . He had n't wanted to be a doctor . He had had a choice between medicine and the priesthood . He had chosen the former because he thought he might like to marry someday . But as the years passed ,  |p131he  found that he did n't want to marry . He was sorry that he had n't chosen the church . Doctor Scalani had been one of three children of an Italian fruit peddler . The old man scrimped and saved because he wanted his children to have a good education and dignified , safe careers . He did n't want them to worry about daily bread . He died happy , feeling that his children were well provided for . Dominick was a doctor , Bernardo a priest , and Anastasia a nun . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kids did n't have to go out to work when they were fourteen . He was able to support them through high school and able to releasehis two sons from the obligation of supporting him so that they could work their way through college . It was tough on Dominick working his way through college and medical school . He had no white fire burning in him at the thought of being a Great Healer . He graduated near the bottom of his class . He did n't mind that . He figured somebody had to graduate at the bottom . There was n't always room at the top . He interned at a small , obscure hospital . When he was done with learning , he went back to his old neighborhood to practice . He did n't know where else to go . He had no money to buy a going practice or to set up one in a better neighborhood . And no kindly old doctor with a prosperous practice that was too much to handle took him in . So he had rented this empty store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make much money . Most of the people diagnosed and treated their own ailments . They drank home-brewed pennyroyal or camomile tea . They rubbed goose grease or camphorated oil on their chests and poured sweet oil in their ears . They dumped carbolic acid on rusty nail tears and rubbed blue ointment into sores . Midwives delivered the babies . When a cough lasted more than a couple of years or a running sore did n't " go away , " they went to the free clinics . When an epidemic came along they wore a bag on a string around their neck . The bag had a cut of garlic or onion in it . Maybe it did n't keep the germs away but the smell of it kept the people who had the germs to give , away . For thep132rest , they lit candles in church and prayed . Doctor Scalani was called in to sign death certificates , examine people for insurance companies , do an emergency delivery when the midwife could n't handle a breech presentation and set broken bones . ( Every once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Weekends , he was fairly busy suturing gashes after Saturday-night knife fights . Sometimes he got paid ; more often he did n't . A patient like Mary Moore who put herself in his hands prior to confinement and paid after each visit was rare indeed . He was n't married but he had a girl . She was known on her block as the doctor 's lady friend . She was a dressmaker . He called her Dodie because her name was Dolores . He had started going with her ten years ago . At first , the objective was marriage . But he did n't seem too anxious to marry and she did n't want to appear too willing . As the years wore on , he stopped talking of marriage . She had thoughts of giving him up because his intentions were no longer serious . But she thought she might as well wait until some other man came along . No other man came along so she continued going along with Dominick . He went to see her once a week , when she 'd cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her kitchen each Sunday at five . It was always warm and steamy , and smelled of garlic , onions , cheese and tomatoes . He always said the same thing : " Something smells good . " She always said the same thing : " I hope it is good . " After he 'd eaten to repletion , he 'd lie on the black leather lounge in her living room and go to sleep . After Dodie had washed the dishes , she 'd come in and put a shawl over his legs . Then she 'd sit in her little rocker next to the head of the couch and hand-whip a hem or fagot a neckline or make buttonholes . She 'd sew in rhythm to his slow , relaxed breathing . She was utterly content . At ten o'clock , he 'd wake up , wash his hands , run a wet comb through his hair and take his leave . He 'd always say the same thing : " That was a good supper , Dodie . " She 'd always say the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he 'd kiss her cheek and she 'd pat his arm twice and he 'd leave . That 's all there was to it . But both , in some curious way , were completely satisfied . It was the doctor 's custom , after a patient had left , to sit inp133his revolving chair before his rolltop desk , tilt the chair back , put his finger tips together and confer with his pictured classmates . It sort of cleared his mind  --  straightened things out for him . He silently addressed his class after Mary had left . Gentlemen , diagnosis clearly indicates that a therapeutic abortionis indicated in the case of the patient , Mary Moore . The procedure is as follows , gentlemen : Two or more physicians must be in agreement after examination that the pregnancy should be terminated . Under proper conditions an abortion is as safe as a tonsilectomy . A question , Mr. Levine ? ( He often used this device to examine both sides of a situation . He listened intently to the man in the last row , second from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) A question , Doctor . Has anyone ever called you in for consultation ? Do you know anyone you could call in ? No . You are not that kind of a doctor . I could do it on my own , Mr. Levine . That would be illegal , Doctor . True . Besides the patient would not consent . Her religion , you know . For the sake of argument , Doctor : Suppose she did consent and you aborted her and something went wrong , what then ? Manslaughter , Doctor . Manslaughter . Hard to prove , Mr. Levine . Loopholes in the law . I acted in the best interests . . . post mortem indicated death was inevitable if pregnancy was allowed to come to childbirth .... You might get off . Sure . But you 'd never he able to practice again . Gentlemen , you have heard Mr. Levine . Mr. Levine is correct on all points . Another question , Mr. Levine ? Yes . What are you going to do ? Doctor Scalani had to think for a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hippocrates said : " Natural forces within us are the true healers of disease . " Roughly translated , that means , let nature take its course . I shall count on natural forces . What else did Hippocrates say , Doctor ? Doctor Scalani sighed . You know it as well as I do.  | " I will not give to a woman any instrument to produce abor-tion . " He stood up . That was right in 400 B.C. , and it 's just as right in 1910 A.D. We are agreed , I believe , that abortion is against ethics and religion . It is a sin against li f e  --  against having the chance for a life to be born . That is all , gentlemen . He put his hands in his pockets and stood looking out of his store window . He wished it were Sunday so that he could go to Dodie 's house . I wonder whatever became of Levine , he thought idly . Lottie gave Maggie-Now instructions : " When your mother gets ready to go to the hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hear ? Right away . I got a surprise for her I 'm saving till the minute her labor starts . Did you ever telephone before ? " " No . " " Here 's what you do : You go to a store where there 's a phone . You ask Central to give you this number I wrote down . Then you put a nickel in the hole . Keep a nickel handy . When the candy-store man down by the corner says , hello , you say , Will you call Mrs. Timothy Shawn to the phone ? Any hour of the day or night he 'll come and get me because I 'm going to give him a dollar when you call up . " A few weeks later , Mary was awakened by the rupturing of the bag of waters . She was alone in the bed ; Pat had taken to sleeping on the lounge in the front room during the past week because Mary was so big and twisted and turned all night trying to get into a comfortable position and she worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her time had come . It will be hard , I know , she thought . It was hard when Maggie-Now .. . but when it was over and they put her in my arms , 1 forgot . I was so happy . It will be the same again . I 'll forget the pain . I hope I have a son . Patrick would be pleased . He said he does n't care but all men want a son . And wo n't Maggie-Now be happy . It 's foolish of me to be afraid ... . But she found she was trembling . She got up and changed the linen on the bed , then she went to wake her daughter . She lookedp135down on her . In sleep , the girl 's face still had the lineaments of childhood . She grasped the girl 's bare forearm gently , because , even though Maggie-Now did n't have red hair , she had the skin that went with red hair and she bruised easily . " Wake up , dear . I have to go to the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes on . " I 'll go wake up Papa . " " No , let him sleep a while longer . It 's going to be hard on him anyhow and I want to put it off as long as possible . No use both of us suffering . " She thought of the girl . " I know you do n't mind helping me . But your father 's different . " Maggie-Now put her arms around her mother . " Do n't go to the hospital , Mama . Have the baby home where I can take care of you . " " It 's better that I go to the hospital . " Doctor Scalani had told her it was necessary in case of surgery . " Now you get the buns and a morning paper for your father to take his mind off things and stop at Doctor Scalani 's first and tell him . " Maggie-Now tapped at the doctor 's door . The shade was down . It shot up a second after her knock . He was in his pajamas and the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket . He assured Maggie-Now that he 'd be at the hospital waiting for her mother . He shut the door and pulled the shade down again . He took a brand-new shirt from a drawer . Dodie had made it for him as a Christmas present . He buttoned it up . The sleeves were a little long . He put sleeve garters on to pull up the sleeves . Dodie had made the garters for him as a birthday gift . He fastened on a stiff collar with a gold collar button that Dodie had given him when they first started going together . He knotted on a black knit tie also made by Dodie for some anniversary or other . He put on the best of his two suits . It was the first time he had ever treated one of his patients at the hospital and he wanted to look nice and make a good impression on the nurses and doctors . It was very early in the morning and the bakery was still closed but Mrs. Luthlen was carrying buns from the back and putting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie-Now . The girl told her about her mother and asked forp136ten cents ' worth of sugar buns . The woman filled a bag to overflowingwith buns hot from the oven . She pushed MaggieNow'sdime back . " On a day like this , I can treat a good customer . Tell your mama I 'll be thinking of her . And let me know , Maggie-Now . " She put a penny on the newsstand and picked up a Journal and went into the candy store and asked to use the telephone . She got the number and shouted through the mouthpiece that she had to speak to Mrs. Timothy Shawn . It took hours , it seemed , before Lottie answered . " Aunt Lottie ! Aunt Lottie ! Can you hear me ? " " Do n't holler , girlie , I ai n't deef  --  yet . " Maggie-Now told her the news . She wanted details but Maggie-Now did n't have any to tell . " Well , listen good , Maggie-Now . Gracie  --  you know , Widdy 's wife ? Well she gave birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been saving it as a surprise for your mother . I know she 's nervous so I thought if she finds out just before how little and skinny Gracie is and how she was in labor only two hours , it might make her feel better . You tell her what I said , hear ? About how skinny Gracie is and only two hours . . . and she was up the third day . " " What 's their names , Aunt Lottie ? " " Well , I 'll tell you , " said Lottie . Maggie-Now groaned . She knew Lottie . She knew Lottie would string out the story . Maggie-Now was nervous . She was afraid her mother would have the baby while she was phoning . " They 're here with me right now , " said Lottie . " Widdy and Gracie went over to Manhattan last night and did n't ... " " Please , Aunt Lottie , what 's their names ? Mama will ask me . " " Well , I wanted to name them Timmy and Jimmy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is that their names ? " " Wait . Widdy wanted to call them Ike and Mike . You know . Because they look alike ? " " I have n't got much time , Aunt Lottie . " " Well , Father Shaley got insulted about Mike and Ike . He said he would n't christen them that . Oh , my ! He gave Widdy Hail Columbia . " " I 'll call you up later , Aunt Lottie. "  | " Wait ! Do you know what they finally named them ? " " Put another coin in the slot , please , " droned the operator . " I got to go , Aunt Lottie . " " Wait ! They finally named one De Witt and the other Clin-ton . " " Put another coin . . . " " Good-by , Aunt Lottie . " " Listen ! Tell your mother not to be brave . Tell her to give in and holler . You do n't holler , they think it do n't hurt . They do n't do nothing . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie-Now was sweating and the warm buns were crushed out of shape because she had held the bag so tight against her . When she got home , her father was up and dressed . Her mother was very nervous and Pat had been trying to calm her down . " If you 'd only stop telling me it 's going to be all right . . . If you 'd only stop talking , " she said . Maggie-Now was astonished . She had always known her mother as kind and considerate . She 'd never heard her speak that way . " Where have you been so long ? " she asked Maggie-Now fretfully . " I promised to call up Aunt Lottie because she had a surprise for you . Gracie and Widdy had twins . " Mary 's face smoothed out . She smiled and sat down . " Oh , is n't that nice ! " " She said to tell you that you know how skinny and nervous Gracie is and Gracie had an easy time . In labor only two hours , Aunt Lottie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , and she was out of bed in three days . " " My , that makes me feel better . What did they name them ? " " De Witt and Clinton , " said Maggie-Now . Mary smiled again . " That Big Red , " burst out Pat . " That Timothy Shawn . Still butting in . Here , " he said to Maggie-Now , " I been trying to quiet down your mother since you went to the store . She wo n't listen to me . But let her hear about Big Red 's grandchildren ... " " That 's all right , Patrick , " said Mary absently . She patted his arm and then began giving nervous instructions as she put her hat on . " Keep the house up , Maggie-Now , so that it 's nice and cleanp138when I come back with the baby . And see that your father has a hot supper when he comes home . . . . Oh , Maggie , how could I get along without you ! And make your father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and see Lottie . And keep off the streets while I 'm away . " " Oh , Mama , now ... " " And Patrick , " continued Mary in an offhand way , " I wantyou to deed over this house to Maggie-Now when she marries . " " We 'll talk about that when the time comes , " he said . She held his arm in a tight clutch . " Promise me , Patrick ! " " I will do so , Mary , " he said . " You heard your father , Maggie-Now ? " " Yes , Mama . " " Remember . He promised . " She gave the girl a little black bankbook . " When the tenants pay the rent , put the money in the bank . It must be saved for taxes and interest . " " I know , Mama . " Mary started to put her gloves on and a pain caught her . She dropped her gloves and held on to the back of a chair . They watched for an agonizing moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first one . " Maggie-Now put her gloves on for her . Mary looked around vaguely . " I did n't get all the ironing done , " she fretted . " Now , Mama , I 'll finish it , " said Maggie-Now . " Do n't worry about a thing . I 'll take good care of Papa and the house will be shining clean for you when you come back . " Mary started trembling violently when she walked into the hospital . It was gloomy and smelled of sickness . The downstairs windows were barred . People stood in line before a nurse 's desk waiting to be admitted or treated . Mary was told to sit on a bench along the wall until her turn came . She sat between her husband and her daughter . Pat sat with his head down , his hands holding his hat between his knees . Maggie-Now pulled her mother 's arm through hers and held it tightly . The nurse finished filling out an old man 's card . She tapped on a bell and an orderly came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was weeping.  | " I will never come out alive , " he wept . " No one ever comes out of here alive . " This was almost true . The poor people were terrified of the hospital and few entered unless they were at death 's door . So it was logical that few came out alive . They kept Mary waiting there because there were so many emergency cases that had to be handled immediately . Childbirth was considered routine  --  not an emergency . The old man 's weepinghad unnerved Mary . She had a sharp pain and when it had passed she said : " Patrick . Do something . Please do something ! " her voice was hysterical . Pat jumped to his feet and shouted : " Where 's that damned doctor ? " An efficient , middle-aged nun , the steel bows of her eyeglasses making ridges in her fleshy cheeks on account of the tightness of her coif , was passing through the room . She turned and scowled and was about to rebuke Pat when Doctor Scalani came into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Mary looked at him in surprise . He was so different from the last time she had seen him . He spoke authoritatively to the desk nurse . Mary was admitted immediately . A nurse came with a wheelchairto take her away . Doctor Scalani told Maggie-Now and her father to go home . He said he 'd let them know ... . At the start of Mary 's third day in labor , Doctor Scalani realized his life 's ambition as a doctor . He was given a consultant  --  a very important consultant indeed  --  the chief of staff of the hospital , who examined Doctor Scalani 's patient and gave him every professional courtesy , which made Doctor Scalani feel good . It was a brief consultation and they were in agreement . If labor continued to term , they agreed , the baby would be born dead . But there was a slight chance that the mother would live . If they intervened and took the baby from her , the child would live but the mother , in her weakened condition , would die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they saved the baby and let the mother die.  |p140She  knew she was going to die . She did n't review her whole life as it is said one does at such a time . She had no last word of wisdom or conclusion drawn from living , no great truth to articulate before she died . She had no thought save for her new-born son . There was a great aching place where the child had been torn from her body . The milk was beginning to fill her breasts . Like a primitive creature , she whimpered for her young and wanted to crawl to it . She begged the nurse to get the child and put it to her breast . The nurse concealed her horror with professional briskness . " After a while , " she said brightly . " After we 've rested a bit . Then we 'll bring our baby in . " The nurse ran out in the corridor looking for Doctor Scalani . She found him . She said : " She wants to nurse her baby . Is n't that awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But to let a live , healthy baby nurse from a dying mother ! It gives me the creeps . " " Let her have her baby . That 's an order . " " Is it ? " She tossed her head . " You 're just an outside doctor . I do n't have to take orders from you . " He grabbed her arm and held it tight enough to make her wince . He spoke , putting a space between each word . " I am the doctor on the case . I am giving you an order . Nurse , take the baby to the patient . " " Yes , Doctor , " she said . There was n't much time . They sent Maggie-Now to her first . " Just act natural , " said Doctor Scalani . " That 's always best . " There was a screen around Mary 's bed . Maggie-Now 's eyes widened in fear when she saw her mother 's waxy-looking face . " Mama ! " she said . " Oh , Mama ! " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the ironing done , Mama . And Papa ate everything I cooked . And I put new shelf paper . . . " Mary heard nothing of what she said . " The baby , " whispered Mary . She tried to pull the blanketaway from his face and could n't . Maggie-Now pulled it back . " Oh , is n't he tiny , " exclaimed the girl . " Is n't he cute ! " " Take him up , " whispered Mary . " What ? "  | " Pick him up . " Maggie-Now put the baby in the crook of her left arm . Instinctively , she held him correctly . His head , not much bigger than an orange , rested against her breast and went up and down a little with the beating of her heart . She put her outspread right hand under his little backside . " Why he fits , Mama , " said Maggie-Now in surprise . " He fits to me just right ! " " Margaret Rose ! " Mary tried to smile . " You 're such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she was quiet for so long that Maggie-Now thought she was sleeping . Maggie-Now started to croon to the baby . Mary opened her eyes then . " Listen , " she whispered . " Do what I say . His bottle . . . the doctor will tell you . Wash eyes , boric acid . Warm sweet oil on head till soft place closes . Keep band on till cord drops off . Boil diapers so no rash . . . Things you do n't know , ask . . . ask Lottie or neighbor with children . Ask . . . " Maggie-Now started to cry . Mary drew on some last strength . Her voice was almost normal . " Do n't cry , " she said . " I might have to stay here a few weeks . Then I 'll be home . Until then ... " The lie was the last sin of her life . A nurse appeared with Patrick Dennis . " Only one visitor at a time , " she said cheerfully , " Wait for me downstairs , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to go home alone . " The girl put the baby back in her mother 's arms . She kissed her mother and went downstairs to wait for her father . Pat looked strange . He 'd had his hair cut , his suit pressed , his shoes shined and he smelled of bay rum . He too had been told to act natural . He tried to act natural and succeeded in acting like a stranger . He sat next to her bed . Dear God , he prayed , give me another chance . Do n't let her die . I 'll do better . I 'll be good to her . I swear it ! Her lips moved . She was trying to say " Patrick . " " Well , Mary , " he said heartily . " I see we got a boy . Now I 'll have somebody to go hunting and fishing with . " ( He 'd never fished or hunted in his life but he thought men were supposed to say that when they had a new son. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the deep caverns in her cheeks and the black hollows under her eyes frightened him . He talked : " Me vacation 's coming up about the time you get out of here . And I tell you what ! We never went nowheres before on me vacationbut this time we 'll go to the country . You know . The Catskills ? Good country air  --  sure and ' twill put you on your feet again . And them fresh eggs off the chickens every day and them vegetables ... " She looked at him with a fixed stare and her eyes flooded with tears which ran down either side of her face . He put his hand on hers but withdrew it without meaning to when he felt how hot and dry her hand was . " Oh , Patrick , " she whispered hoarsely . " In all our years you never told me . . . " " No , I never told you , Mary . But I do . " No , he had never told her that he loved her and now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the word " love " now . It was a simple word , easily said , but he could n't say it . In some obscure way , he felt it would make him a stranger to her . " But I do , Mary , and you know it . I do n't have to say it . Me and you . . . we was never ones to say things like that to each other because we never started out that way . But I do . I do . " " It 's too late , " she whispered , weeping . " That 's no way to talk , " he said with false heartiness . " Why , you 'll bury us all . " It was n't the right thing to say but that 's the way he was used to talking . If I talk different , he thought , she 'll know that I know she 's going to die . Mother Ursula , the head of all nurses , lay nurses and nursing sisters , came in . She put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up . " Was the child christened ? " he asked . " This morning , " said Mother Ursula . " Right after he was born . He was named Dennis Patrick . " " My wife ? " he asked . " Father Flynn will stay with her . " Pat understood . He got his hat from under the chair and leaned over Mary . He pressed his cool cheek to her dry cheek  | " I love you , Mary , " he whispered . He bumped into the screen as he went out . Mother Ursula straightened it . A very young nun came in with a basin of water and a towel . She washed Mary 's face and hands and feet . Another nun brought in a small table covered with a linen napkin and set up two beeswax candles on it . She placed a crucifix between the candles . She arranged a tumbler of water and a saucer of fine salt on the table . She added a cruet of oil and a piece of cotton . Mother Ursula lit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Host . The three nuns genuflected and withdrew . Father Flynn knelt down by the bed with his ear to Mary 's lips and she made her last confession . He absolved her from her sins and gave her Extreme Unction . When all was over , she made a harsh sound of fear . He understood . He took her hand . " My child , " he said , " my friend . Have no fear . I 'll stay with you . I 'll stay with you all the time that 's left . " But the terror grew in her . She did n't want to die ! She did n't want to die ! Her hand clutched the sheet and she made little moans . A nurse looked in and flew down to the office to get Doctor Scalani . He came after a while with a hypodermic needle poised in his hand . Father Flynn shook his head . " No , " he said . " Obviously , she 's suffering , " said the doctor . " This will help . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let her live and suffer until life is gone . " The doctor could have said what he had said to the nurse : " I am the doctor on the case . " But he knew Father Flynn would say : " I am the priest . " The priest took precedence at death . To show he was in accord with the priest , the doctor pressed the plunger of his needle and let the liquid squirt out on the floor . She was past talking now and her terror grew . Her face seemed like a grotesque mask with a twisted mouth . Father Flynn spoke quietly to her but he could n't get to her . He prayed . Then the baby cried . Concern mixed with her terror . The baby was lying in the crook of her arm and she tried to tighten her arm to bring the baby nearer . Her other hand plucked futilely at the drawstring of her nightdress . She stared at the priest and herp144face went into distortions as she tried to communicate with him . He guessed what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn my head away ? " Her face straightened out and she waited . " I 'll help you , my child , and I 'll keep my eyes shut . " He felt for her arm with his eyes shut , and folded it around the baby . Gently , he pushed the baby toward its mother 's breast . He put her other arm across the child , placing the palm of her hand at the back of the baby 's head . He pulled the sheet up over her exposed breast . When he opened his eyes , he saw that the terror had left her face and her distorted mouth had relaxed . The peace was beginning to come . He sat down to stay with her to the end as he had assured her . He waited and he prayed while he waited . And soon his waiting was ended . He undid her arms and took the child from them . He walked down the hospital corridor carrying the child . A nurse with briskly tapping heels walked past him and smiled back over her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " First turn to the right . " " I know , " he said . CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 9MOLLY MoRIARITY had been unable to come to the funeral . She had nursed Aunt Henrietta through her final illness . Molly herself was frail and failing and the news of her only child 's death had prostrated her . Cousin Robbie came down from Boston to represent Mary 's kin . Mary had been insured for enough to provide a simple burial and to buy a grave . Cousin Robbie had instructions from The Missus ; Mary could be buried with her father provided the money Pat saved on the grave would be used to pay off the balance of the loan on the house . Pat agreed . So the little house was freed . Before he left , Cousin Robbie said : " Aunt Molly said she'dp145be glad to take the children but on account of her poor health .. . and she 's too old . . . But my girl , Sheila , said she 'd be tickled to death to have them . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't make much difference . Maggie-Now would be a help and you could send so much a week for board . . . . " " I 'll keep me children with me , " said Pat . " Maggie-Now knows how to run the house and she 'll look after the boy . " " She 's young . She should n't be tied down with a baby . Maybe she wants to live her own life . " " Me mother was tied down with two children when she was Maggie-Now 's age and it did n't harm her . The girl is strong and healthy . " " The responsibility . . . " " It will keep her out of trouble . She 'll know the work of a home and a baby . She wo n't be so anxious to marry the first clown what comes along . " " She 's not going to have much fun . " " And is that any of your business ? " " No , Patrick , " said Cousin Robbie slowly . " It 's none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . She did n't mind at all . She was not the studious or bookish type . She missed her school friends and the nuns who were her teachers . Otherwise she was glad to be done with school . When she dropped school her girl friends tried to continue to include her in their activities but it could n't work out because MaggieNowwas tied down with a house and a baby . The few boys she knew , had taken walks with and joked around with , drifted away . Maggie-Now seemed a woman all of a suddenand it made a boy feel " funny " to see a girl with whom he had romped in Cooper 's Park just weeks ago now trundling a baby carriage through that same park . Her friends now were more mature : Lottie , of course , and a neighbor or two who had helped her out with the baby at first . The shopkeepers , for the most part , liked her . They admired her courage and wished her well . Mr. Van Clees , the Dutch cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought her father 's clay pipes and tobacco , became her friend . He tookp146almost a paternal interest in the baby boy . And later she was friends with the Vernachts , a German couple whom she met through Mr. Van Clees . She cared for the baby and ran the house for her father . Her arrangements with him were simple . He gave her two dollars to buy groceries . When the money was gone , she asked for more . He always said : " What 'd you do with the last two dollars I gave you ? " She always answered : " I spent it . " Then he gave her another two dollars . She collected the rent and put the money in the bank . Once a year she went down to Borough Hall to pay the taxes . She had expected her father to handle that but he had said : " Since you 're going to be the owner someday , you learn to handle property . " Sometimes there was a little surplus in the bank after taxes . Other times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie-Now was a natural-born mother . She washed the baby and fed him and changed his diapers and had him out in the air for a couple of hours each day . When he started to walk and was knowing enough to get into mischief , she took a true mother 's privilege and spanked him  --  but always with a kiss as Sheila had done with her children . Like a mother , she thought Denny was exceptionally handsomeand she enjoyed the admiring looks given him when she took him out in his buggy . She wanted nice clothes for him , but when she asked her father 's permission to use some of the surplus rent money to buy them , he refused , saying the money must be saved for hard times  --  for his old age . " When you 're married to a man in business for himself you 'll have everything you need , while me , who slaved me life away for me children , will be sitting and starving in a hallroom in me old age . " Because she wanted pin money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands , she , as the expression went in the neighborhood , " took in piecework . " She " turned " kid gloves . They were made in a factory in Greenpoint and sewn wrong side out on machines . She took bundles of them home to turn right side out . She got twenty cents a hundred pair and made two or three dollars a week in her odd hours . When she got bored with the gloves , she went to a shoe factory and got bundles of bronze leather slipper vamps andp147sewed cut bronze beads on a design stamped on the vamp . She liked the work and got satisfaction out of her neat stitches . Bronze slippers went out of style and she " made beads . " These were necklaces of tiny white beads with yellow or blue daisies at intervals  --  much like Indian beadwork . She worked with five threaded needles simultaneously and enjoyed the emergence of the daisy design . She considered herself fortunate to be able to earn a few dollars a week without leaving her home . She used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once in a while , an item of clothing for herself . Each time she bought a new bonnet for Denny or a new pair of rompers , she brought him over to Mr. Van Clees 's store to show him off . " Hello , liddle mudder , " was his greeting . " How goes it , hey ? " " Fine . " Then he 'd ask questions about the baby  --  how much did he weigh now , did he cry a lot and did he eat good . He was astonished at each answer : He weighs all that ? My ! Never cries and eats everything ? My ! A wonder of a boy ! A wonder ! " And do you miss your school , Miss Maggie ? " " Yes . The sisters and the girls . But I sure do n't miss all that homework . " He gave Denny a little blue candle on his first birthday . ( " In case'n you have a birthday cake for him , Miss Maggie . " ) He gave him two on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanking him , said : " Oh , Mr. Van Clees , you should be Denny 's godfather . " " That I could not be , Miss Maggie . I ai n't a Catholic . " " But I see you at Mass every Sunday . Used to , anyhow . " " I go by the Catholic church because it 's nearer as my church . But I ai n't a Catholic . " " I see , " said Maggie-Now . But she did n't see at all . Mr. Van Glees , a bachelor , was a chubby little man who had come from Holland when he was quite young . He had a little money and he bought a little building with a one-window store and living quarters above it . He was a cigar maker and he set up his work table in the store window . He worked at a long tablep148there with hands of tobacco and a pile of new cigar boxes . He sat there all day , except when waiting on customers , and rolled cigars by hand , moistening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it stick . He worked in the window because the light was better there and because people stopped to watch him work . He loved an audience . He prospered in a small way . Lots of men liked hand-rolled cigars . He also carried a stock of fine smoking tobacco . As a third-generation cigar maker , he hated cigarettes and refused to stock them . He had a wooden Indian in front of his store with war bonnet and a short skirt made of feathers and thongs around his legs . The Indian , which he painted each spring , had a get-on-your-mark stance and held up a hand of wooden tobacco as though it were a torch . The kids said that Van Clees 's great grandfather had bought the land for the cigar store from a chief for two dollars . And he had " skinned " the chief , who fought with him and was killed by the great grandfather , and the chief 's body was put inside the wooden Indian . Anyhow , that 's the story the kids told . Mr. Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within walking distance of his home . So he held his own Protestant service in Father Flynn 's church which was two blocks away . He brought his own prayer book and hymnal . He read the Gospel of the day sonorously in his mind ; he sang the hymns rousingly in Dutch in a deep , mumbling bass  --  also in his mind . He sat quietly with folded hands listening to an imaginary sermon . The sermons suited him fine . When he did n't want to wait , the sermon was short . When he had time and liked to sit a while , he let the sermon go on as long as he wished . Most of the imaginary sermons were long because he liked to sit in the church . It was dim and cool in summer and warm and bright in winter and where else did he have to go on a Sunday ? He went to church at three in the afternoon to hold his own services . He started out by going to morning Mass but he got tired of the dirty looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ritual of the Mass . For instance , when the little silver bell tinkled out of the scented silence and people were on their knees , hand over heartp149and tapping the breast gently each time the bell sounded , like as not Mr. Van Glees was on his feet , opened hymn book in hand , head thrown back and silently mouthing a galloping hymn of joy everlasting . He had a habit of leaving , bumping past people 's knees , at the exact time the collection plates were being passed . People thought he was a cheapskate . He was n't . It was that his own private services usually came to a logical end at the time of the collection . He had tried going in the afternoon and liked it much better . The church , unless there was a wedding or a christening , was almost empty then and Mr. Van Glees could sit , stand or kneel as he chose . He could even sleep if he wished . Father Flynn knew Mr. Van Glees was n't a Catholic but he urged him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Van Glees accepted the offer with the proviso that Father Flynn make no attempt to convert him . " Oh , you 'll be a Catholic someday , by osmosis , if nothing else , " said Father Flynn . They liked each other ; they were friends , Father Flynn and the Lutheran . Mr. Van Glees kept the priest 's humidor full of good pipe tobacco . Father Flynn appreciated this because it was indeed a poor living in that poor parish . , " CHAPTER TWENTY-TWOMR . VAN GLEES was instrumental in bringing Maggie-Now and the Vernachts together . August Vernacht had been a woodcutter back in Germany . When he came to America , there was no trade in Brooklyn known as woodcutting . Gus , however , was handy and had an aptitude for working with wood . He called himself a carpenter but really he was a free-lance repair man . When he married Annie ( American born of German immigrants ) , he got a steady job in a furniture factory that specialized in making rocking chairs.  |p150Gus  supported Annie , his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did n't have everything they wanted  --  or even that they needed for that matter . But they were never in actual want . They were contented . Gus 's hobby was woodcarving . For years , now , he 'd been working on a chess set . He kept his bits of wood , ebony , ash , oak and any other wood that came his way , in Van Clees 's store . When he had a spare hour , he 'd drop in the store and whittle away while he and Van Clees engaged in endless , friendly debate on the ways of the world . They were pals : Gus Vernacht and Jan Van Clees . They talked , played checkers and tried to teach each other chess . Sometimes on a holiday , they went to Glendale Schiitzen Park and shot at targets with rented rifles and had a few seidels of beer afterward . Gus knew all about Maggie-Now before he met her . He knew about the baby . Van Clees made a moving story of it when he told Gus about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gus happened to be in the store one Saturday afternoon when Maggie-Now came in with Dennis to get two clay pipes for her father . After the introductions , Gus said : " You must come and be friends with my Ahn-nee . A little girl like you needs a big woman for a friend . So you come by my house and be friends . " " Annie 's a good lady , Miss Maggie , " said Van Clees . " Ahl-zo a good mutter , " said Gus . " We got the boy , Chamesee , and he has eight years . And the baby , T'ressa , she is zwei months younger as your brother , Denn-ty here . And my Ahnnee , she will be good by you , and give you to eat cake and coffee , and put you in the bed to rest and cover you up . And you want to go down on the street and walk with the other girls ? She will mind Denn-ty for you . " " You go see Annie , Miss Maggie , " advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She asked him . Pat did n't like the idea . " How do I know who these people are ? " " They 're well known in the neighborhood . And after all , Papa , I 'm eighteen . I know what I 'm doing . " " The House of the Good Shepherd is full-a girls , eighteen ,  |p151what  knew what they were doing , " he said darkly . " What house ? " " Where they put wayward girls . " " I 'm not wayward . " " Things happen before you know it , " he said mysteriously . He had a clutch of fear . She was growing up . She looked mature for her age . Why , he had started courting Maggie Rose when she had been a year younger than Maggie-Now . It had been the girl 's virtue and her mother 's nosiness and not his inclinationthat had kept Maggie Rose virginal . But that was nearly twenty-five years ago , he consoled himself . Things is different now . Girls that young do n't keep steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mary , why did you have to die when the girl needs a mother so bad to tell her things ? I ca n't tell her . No , he could n't . As with many fathers , the thought of sex in his daughter 's life was abhorrent to him . He could n't stand the thought of any male lusting after her . For the first time , he worried about his daughter . He knew that in some ways the congested neighborhood was a jungle where men preyed on girls : innocent girls , susceptible girls and willing girls . He knew of the narrow , trash-filled back alleys , the dark cellars , tenement rooftops cluttered with chimney pots , vacant stores where doors could be forced . . . he knew all of these places where men took young girls for their purposes . He had thought his daughter was safe in the home and where else did she go ? To the store and sometimes to Lottie 's house . But was she safe ? This man who invited her to his home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife ; maybe that was a comeon . Something else came to his mind . A month before , the upstairs had been rented to a mother and father who worked and their son , about twenty , who did n't have a job and loafed around the house all day . After they had examined the empty rooms and had announced when they 'd move in , the woman had commented on the fact that Pat 's daughter was young to be married and have a two-year-old baby . " She ai n't married , " said Pat.  |p152The  woman exchanged a surprised look with her husband and their son grinned . " That 's why the baby has her maiden name for his last name . " " He has my name . He 's my son . His mother died in child-birth . " " I see . Well , that 's all right . " She exchanged another look with her husband . Pat wondered how many men , strangers to the neighborhood  --  newcomers  --  believed that Maggie-Now had an illegitimate son . Did those kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow upstairs  --  how he had been standing on the stoop one time when Maggie-Now had gone out to the store and how the young man had looked after her as she walked down the block . He was angry with his daughter because she made him concernedabout her and spoiled the even tenor of his days . So he shouted at her , not realizing that she could n't know what he had been thinking : " And I do n't want you making free with that loafer upstairs , either . " " Papa ! Where 'd you ever get the idea . . . " She stopped abruptly . She had had some contact with the boy upstairs . A week ago , he 'd come to the door and asked politely if the upstairs tenants had the privilege of the yard . She said they did and she let him go through her rooms because there was no other way to reach the yard . He explained that he wanted to get a little tan . He pulled his shirt off in the yard and bounced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen window , admiring his manly torso and wishing she could go out and play handball with him . She decided he must never walk through their rooms again . Suppose her father came back during the day for some reason or other and he found the young man in the kitchen ! He would n't accept any explanation she could make . Thereafter , she kept her door locked when she was in the house alone with Denny and did n't answer when he knocked . One evening in the time between after supper and dark , she was sitting on the stoop with Denny . She was restless . She dreaded the evening ahead . She 'd put Denny to bed and then what ? She 'd walk about the house looking for something to dop153to kill the long evening . She and her father seldom conversed with each other at any length . She was not an avid reader and what was there to do but go to bed ? She did n't want to go to bed . She wanted to be out walking these summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh and exchange confidences . She wanted some boy to call for her and take her for a walk ; treat her to a soda . She wanted to ride on an open car to Coney Island with a bunch of boys and girls and laugh with the girls at the way the boys cut up . She wanted to ride side saddle on a merry-go-round horse with a nice young man standing at her side , his arm about her waist , pretending he had to hold her so 's she would n't fall off . She closed her eyes and dreamed the scene : The blend of merry-goroundmusic and the voices of barkers and the hum of talking voices and laughter and the sound of the sea . The smells mixed of hot corn and cotton candy and candied apples on a stick and over all the heavy salt smell of the sea . And the breeze and the motion of the merry-go-round making her hair blow back and the delicious reaching out for a grasp at the gold ring and the nice-looking young man looking up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist when the horse went up .. . That was her sudden dream . She closed her eyes to see the reality . She got up at seven each morning to get breakfast for her father . She did the housework . The rooms were few and the furnishings sparse . She had it neat and shining in an hour . She drew out her shopping as long as she could . The storekeepers were her only social contacts . At ten , save for getting a simple lunch for herself and the baby and preparing a simple supper for the three of them , her work was done . The long day and evening stretched out interminably . She washed her hair and filed her nails and washed clothes that were already clean and pressed things that needed no pressing and did piecework when she could get it . On nice days she wheeled Denny to the park , first walking down the block and asking the neighbor women if they would let her take a preschoolchild along as long as she had Denny anyhow . She usually took three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all this was n't enough . She was strong and healthy and vitalp154and full of energy . She wanted to work hard . She wanted to go to places . She wanted friends her own age . She wanted to talk and laugh with young people . She wanted to work in a factory ; she wanted to work in a store measuring cloth or wrapping up dishes . Most of all , she wanted to " go out . " She thought of Annie Vernacht . When Gus had told her about his Annie , Maggie-Now had thought how wonderful it would be to be friends with Annie ; to have someone pour her a cup of coffee , cut her a piece of cake . And Gus had said Annie would mind Denny .... Maggie-Now had planned that , for each hour Annie would mind Denny while she , Maggie-Now , went out , Maggie-Now would mind Annie 's children three hours to pay back . But her father did n't want her to visit the Vernachts . And that was that . The young man from upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat and said it was a pleasant evening . She agreed , turning her head away as she spoke in case her father was watching from the window . As she put Denny to bed , she made up her mind . She would go and visit Annie Vernacht and she would n't tell her father . The following Sunday afternoon , she dressed Denny in his nicest rompers , slicked down his hair , dressed herself up and told her father she was going out and would be home in time to cook his supper . He grunted without looking up from the paper he was reading . " Come in ! Come in ! " boomed Gus . " This is my Ahn-nee . " He grabbed his hat . " I go now by Jan 's cigar store and leave the ladies to talk lady talk . " He left . Annie was hospitable but bewildered . Gus , like many another man before him , had forgotten to tell his wife he had invited Maggie-Now for a visit . In fact , he had forgotten to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . Maggie-Now smiled . " Sit down , " invited Annie . The room was neat , warm and peaceful . The boy , Jamesie , leaned against his mother 's knee . The baby , Theresa , slept in her mother 's arms . Another baby , soon to come , lay quietly in the womb.  |p155Dennis  struggled to get out of his sister 's arms . " Can I put him down ? " asked Maggie-Now . " Sure , sure . " She put Denny on the floor . He staggered around frantically for a few seconds , then crawled under the table and composed himself for sleep . He slept during the entire visit . " What 's her name ? " asked Jamesie . " Sh ! " said Annie . Smiling at Maggie-Now , she said : " I am Annie . " The girl smiled back . " I know . " " And you ? " Gus had forgotten to tell his wife the girl 's name . " I 'm Margaret Moore . You know . Maggie-Now ? " Again they exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap waiting for the friendship to begin . Annie wished there was some tactful way in which she could ask the young girl what was the object of the visit . Annie cleared her throat . " You are young to be a mother . " " Oh , he 's my brother . My mother died when he was born . " " I think maybe I saw her on the street . Some ladies was telling me about her baby coming . Your father : He is the street sweeper ? " " Yes . Street cleaner . He 's home , " she added . " He 's got good work . Steady . My man , he makes the rocking chairs . " " I know . Mr. Van Clees told me . " " Ah , that Jan ! " Annie smiled mysteriously . Maggie-Now , half child , half woman , wondered : Will sheask me if I 'd like her to mind Denny sometime , like Mr. Vernacht said , so I can go out by myself sometime ? Annie thought : What must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind but inarticulate and shy . If Gus had only thought to tell her about Maggie-Now ! She would have been so happy to take the girl into her heart and her warmth . Gus would have denied that he had forgotten to tell his wife all about Maggie-Now . It was that they had so much wordless and perfect understanding together that he thought somehow Annie knew as much about Maggie-Now as he did . Annie sat there trying to draw on this unspoken understanding . The most she could get was that something was expected of her ; that Gusp156had prepared the girl for something and the girl now expected it . But what ? " Did Gus say I should do something ? " she asked gently . Maggie-Now 's face flushed with embarrassment . So Gus had said nothing to his Annie and she , Maggie-Now , had come there so brash expecting .. . " No , " she said . " Nothing . " There was a little more forced conversation and then MaggieNowprepared to leave . The good-bys were effusive because both were ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their teeth into . " You come again when you can stay longer , " said Annie . " And you come to my house some afternoon , " said MaggieNow . " I 'll make coffee . " Annie did not return the visit . Some weeks later , Maggie-Now saw Gus in the cigar store and told him she hoped Annie would come for a cup of coffee sometime . " Ahn-nee , she do n't go out now , " he explained . " The baby comes soon . But you come by our house . " " I will , " said Maggie-Now . But she did n't . And Annie never did come to see her . Van Clees told Maggie-Now when Annie 's baby , a boy , was born . He had been named Albert August . Maggie-Now gave Mr. Van Clees a pair of booties to give to Gus to give Annie . She gave a verbal message : She would come to see Annie and the baby as soon as Annie got over the ordeal of birth . Annie sent a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gave it to Maggie-Now : Annie would come and visit Maggie-Now as soon as she got on her feet . They never did get together . However , whenever Gus saw the girl he said : " Ahn-nee sends best regards . " Maggie-Now always said : " Likewise . " One day the cigar store was closed . There was a sign in the window : Closed on Account of Death in the Family . Gus Vernacht had not been a relative of Van Clees but the cigar maker had borrowed the sign from the baker who had bought it two years ago when his wife 's father died . Van Clees could not cross out In the Family and print in Of Friend becausep157the baker wanted it back . He thought he might have to use it again . He had a lot of relatives . About Gus : It was nothing you could put your finger on ; nothing you could anticipate . He went to bed one night as usual and did n't wake up the next morning . Doctor Scalani said : " Heart ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort they could to Annie . " Such a good man , " said one . " Yeah , the best ones are the first to go , " said another . " Sure . The bums , they hang on . " " Well , if he had to go , " was the general opinion , " it 's better he went in his sleep . That way , he never knew a thing about it . " CHAPTER TWENTY-THREEMAGGIE-Now let a year go by without seeing Annie . Denny came down with the measles and the Board of Health put a quarantine sign on the door . While Denny was convalescing , Pat , to his great shame , caught the measles from Denny . Pat had never been sick before and he carried on as though he were in the last stages of leprosy . He called for the priest and demanded the last rites of the church . Father Flynn said he did n't give Extreme Unction for measles . But he heard his confession and gave him communion and sat at Pat 's bedside for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's right , " said Pat , aggrieved , " take advantage of a man sick and flat on his back . " " As an ordained priest , " said Father Flynn , " I have to be patient with you . But as private citizen Joseph Flynn , I 'd enjoy punching you in the nose . " Pat looked at him with interest and felt a glow . Sure , he is a man after all , thought Pat , and worthy of me hate . During that year , Annie had moved away ; somewhere on DekalbAvenue , Van Clees said . He could go right up to the house , he said , but he could n't tell her the number . The next time he'dp158write it down and Maggie-Now could go and visit poor Annie . Something happened to Maggie-Now about this time and it drove all thoughts of Annie and of nearly everything else out of Maggie-Now 's mind . She was sitting in the yard one afternoon with Denny . She had washed her hair and was drying it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sat in a camp chair and watched Denny try to dig holes in the cementlike ground with a tablespoon . She heard her kitchen door open and close . To her consternation , the young man from upstairs came into the yard ! She 'd forgotten to lock the front door . He greeted her , said hello buster to Denny , who stared at him , and pulled off his shirt . He started hand batting the ball against the wooden fence , running back and forth . He stopped as suddenly as he had begun and threw himself on the ground next her chair . He leaned his head against her knee , panting from his exertions . She was fascinated and revolted . His curly hair was sweaty and she felt his hot face against her knee through her thin summer dress . She pulled her knee away . " We got a hard-to-get girlie here , " he said . " I got to go in now , " she said inanely . " Suits me , " he said . " What are we going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up . He put his arms around her legs . " Stop that ! " she said sharply . " Just as you say . " He clasped his arms around his knees . She stood there a moment , feeling foolish . " Come , Denny , we 're going in the house now , " she said . " Listen , " said the fellow from upstairs , " a couple friends of mine are throwing a party tonight . How about it ? " " How about what ? " " Would you like to go ? " " Thank you . But my father would n't let me . " " Tell him you 're spending the night with a girl friend . I 'll sneak you in the house before he wakes up . " " My father would n't let me go out with you . Not with any feller . " " He must have let you out once , " he said . He winked toward Denny.  | " You go in the house first , " she said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go in . " " Now listen , kid , I 'm wise . I know my way around . Sure , sure . You palm the kid off as your brother . Well , that 's all right by me . So you made a mistake once . Well , we all make mistakes . That 's why they put rubbers on lead pencils . " " But he is so my brother . Are n't you , Denny ? " " Mama ? " murmured Denny . He held the spoon out to her . " That 's the ticket , buster , " said the young man . " Spoon . We 'll do a little spooning first . . . " Maggie-Now started to tremble . He put his arms around her . " Let me go ! " she said , trying not to scream on account of the neighbors . He kissed her . " You . . . you . . . " she searched for a word . " You slob ! " She was frantic with anger and with fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell my father what you said . And he 'll kill you . " He surrendered suddenly . " Okay , then . Only you ca n't blame a feller for trying . You know how it is . You been there . " She pulled Denny up and ran into the house . She slammed the door and locked it . She locked the front-room door . The young man pounded on the kitchen door . " Hey ! How am I gon na get in to go upstairs ? " " Go jump over the fence ! " she shouted . He did . It was n't a very high fence . She heard him come in through the street door . He went up the stairs whistling . She did n't leave the house for a week she was so frightened and ashamed . She thought that any man she might encounter on the street would think as the boy upstairs thought : that she was no good and had had a baby without being married . She sent a neighbor 's little girl to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard . She sat close to the house so the boy upstairs could n't see her without leaning far out the window . And always she worried about the boy upstairs . She did n't tell her father as she had threatened . She knew he would say : It 's your fault . You must have encouraged him.  |p160The  time came when her father ran out of tobacco and busted the last of his clay pipes . He told her to go to Van Clees . She said she did n't want to go ; she was no longer a child and it did n't look right for a young lady to go into a man 's cigar store . Pat went and came home in a rage . Van Clees had inquired about Maggie-Now and told Pat of Gus and Annie and how much Annie had enjoyed her visit and Van Clees said he hoped Maggie-Now would go to Annie 's new home to see her . He gave Pat the address on a slip of paper and Pat tore it up and threw the scraps at Van Clees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clees said bluntly that there was no profit in clay pipes . He carried them only to accommodate people he liked . " And you are one people I do n't like , " he said in conclusion . Pat took it all out on Maggie-Now . She listened at first with astonishment and then with weariness . She saw her father with new eyes . How wrong he was , she thought , talking about the Vernachts as though they were white slavers when she herself knew they were kind and gentle . Before this time , the girl had always believed that her father was right  --  not fair , but essentiallyright . Now she doubted a lot of the things that her father had told her . She was certain , now , that she could n't tell him about the boy upstairs . He 'd never believe her story . He 'd have his own versionof the incident and it would be lurid and poor Maggie-Now would be made to be at fault . She was too wholesome of temperament and too resilient to brood too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being afraid of the boy upstairs , she went out again and stopped being afraid . Let people think what they want , she decided . They ca n't be arrested for thinking . And I ca n't walk around with a sign on my back which says : This is my baby brother and not my son . And as for the feller upstairs . . . he just better stay out of my way , that 's all . The young man was removed from her life . The people upstairsdefaulted in their rent and Pat went up to see about it . " Being 's your daughter wo n't let my son go in the yard , we 're not going to pay the rent , " said the tenant.  | " The roof is for the people upstairs and the yard for the people downstairs , " said Pat . " The roof is slanty , " argued the tenant . " Nobody can sit on it . " " Pay the rent or move out . " " We 'll move out . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent . " " We ca n't stay ; we ca n't move . Make up your mind , " sneered the tenant . The tenants cut this Gordian knot by moving and not paying the rent . They got the iceman to move their furniture in his pushcart . Maggie-Now sent a little boy to where Pat was working . Pat came running , clutching his broom in his hand . Pat started to pull a marble-topped bureau off the cart . He figured that was the same value as the rent owed . The tenant called the cop on the beat . The cop judiciously listened to both sides , holding his nightstick in his hands behind his back and swinging it between his legs . When Pat and the tenant had done , the cop gave his verdict . " I got no use for landlords , " was his opening statement . He handed down his opinion at length . He thought it was " funny " that a man working for the city could own his own home . He cited his own experience . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could n't afford to own his own home . There was something fishy . . . . In short , he found for the tenant . The iceman moved off with bells jangling and furniture swayingon the cart . Pat followed him with brandished broom . He was going to follow the cart to the new residence and badger his ex-tenants from there . " Make him stop follying our furniture , " ordered the tenant . " I got me rights , " said Pat . " I 'm not follying anything . I 'm walking back to me work and the pushcart is in front of me . " Pat kept walking . The cop put his chin in his hand and squeezed it  --  thinking . There was nothing in rules and regulations about a man walking to work . . . . " Ai n't you gon na do nothing ? " inquired the tenant . The pushcart and Pat rounded the corner . The cop solved the problem . " There 's nothing I can do . He 's off my beat now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to Pat . " I know how is . Me , I on your side . I give you address new place . You do n't walk so far . " Pat thought that was a good idea . The Italian gave him a fake address . Thus the feller who gave Maggie-Now her first kiss was gone forever . From now on , he 'd be nothing but a lifetime memory . She took Denny to see Van Clees on his third birthday . It took the good man a few minutes to recognize her . She had grown tall in the year and now was quite buxom for her nineteen years . He was pleased to see her and delighted with Denny . He had three small blue candles for him . He told her about Annie ; she 'd moved again , to Flushing Avenue , the other side of Broadway ; a very poor neighborhood . The two younger children went to nursery school or the day nursery as it was called and Jamesie  --  such a good boy , said Van Clees  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she works now , " sighed Van Clees . " In the five-ten store on Broadway . Now she gives the best years of her life up for making open sandwiches . " He sighed again . Maggie-Now went over to the dime store . It was the lunch hour and the lunch counter was crowded . There was a woman , sometimes two and three , standing behind each lunch stool , breathing down the luncher 's neck and watching each bite and making snide remarks to fellow standees about how long some people nursed a sandwich . Maggie-Now saw Annie and stood behind a stool waiting to catch her eye . Annie was making a hot roast-beef sandwich . She took a slice of bread from a drawer , a thin slice of cold meat from an agate tray , placed the meat on the bread , a scoopfulof gravy , mashed potato next the bread and a dipperful of warmish , tan gravy over all . She set the plate down before the customer and looked up for a second . Maggie-Now started to smile . Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you in a second , Miss , " said Annie . So she did n't recognize me , thought Maggie-Now . That 's that . I did the best I could to be friends with her.  |p163MAGGIE-Now  brought Denny up the way she 'd been brought up . It was the only way she knew . She took him to Coney Island once or twice in the summer instead of Rockaway , because the fare was cheaper . He loved the sea and the sand as much as she had as a child . Unlike her , however , Denny always sought out a group of children . He could n't enjoy jiggling up and down in the waves by himself . He had to show off to other kids . He would n't eat the shoebox lunch she brought from home . He wanted an apple-on-a-stick , a hot dog , or a water-logged ear of sweet corn with melted butter painted on . She wondered why he did n't like the things she 'd liked as a child . The only way she could explain it was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she told her father , " he costs . " " That 's because he 's a boy , " said Pat . When they went to the cemetery on Decoration Day , Denny , like his sister , wanted to sit on the front seat . Only he would n't sit . He kept jumping up to stand next the motorman . The trip was made to the rhythm of the motorman 's monotonous chant : " Down , boy , sit down . " " Boys are so much more active than girls , " she explained to a grumpy lady on the same seat . " I 'll let you pick out the flower to plant on the grave , " she offered . Unlike his sister , he was not interested in geraniums no matter what colors they were . " I want to plant a flag on the grave , " he said . " Flags are for soldier 's graves only . " " Grandpa was a soldier . " " No , he was n't , Denny . " " He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grandfather . " " He told me all the same to plant a flag on his grave . "  | " Well , I 'm not going to buy you a flag . And that 's all . " But it was n't all . He threw himself down on the sidewalk , full length , and announced he would n't get up until she bought him a flag . She was embarrassed . " Denny ! Get up ! See all the people looking at you . " " Yeah , " he said with deep satisfaction . She bought him the flag . Boys want their own way more than girls do , she decided . At the cemetery , Mrs. Schondle , wearing the same dress and veils , or a painful reproduction of the same , hobbled over to exchange greetings . " Denny , say hello to Mrs. Schondle , " suggested Maggie-Now . " I want a penny , " he countered . " Say hello , now , " persisted his sister . " I want a penny . " Mrs. Schondle dived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " What do you say , Denny ? " nudged Maggie-Now . " Hello , " he said . Boys are n't as polite as girls , she added to her list of boy-isms . " He 's only four , " she apologized to Mrs. Schondle . " That 's all right , " said Mrs. Schondle graciously . But she thought : If he 's that way at four , he 'll be in reform school when he 's fourteen . They were leaving . Denny pulled up the flag . " You 're supposedto leave it there , Denny , " said Maggie-Now . " Grandpa said he do n't want it . " She sighed but let it go . Denny lagged behind as his sister and Mrs. Schondle made their slow way to the exit . Near the gates , Denny caught up with them . He had half a dozen flags clutched in his fist . " Denny ! " she said horrified . " A man give ' em to me , " he said . Just then a little boy ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lady ! He took ' em off-a graves . " Denny fixed the little boy with his eye . " The man , " he said slowly , " told me to give you one . Here ! " " Yeah , " said the boy . " A man give ' em to him . " He ran off with the flag.  |p165Maggie-Now  could think of no boy-ism for that . Mrs. Schondle supplied one . " Well , that 's a boy for you , " she said . The next year , Mrs. Schondle did not walk over to greet them . The Schondle grave looked raw and was mounded . Maggie-Now walked over to the grave . Yes . Fresh carving . . . a winter date ... Elsie Schondle , beloved wife . . . Maggie-Now sat on the ground next the grave and wept . It was n't that she had been so close to Mrs. Schondle . It was because while Mrs. Schondle was alive , a little bit of Maggie-How 's mother had still lived . The boy , Denny , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms around her neck . " Do n't cry , my mama , " he said . " Do n't cry , my sister . Do n't cry , my Maggie-Now . I love you . " Then Maggie-Now got the definitive boy-ism . Tenderness is scarce in boys , she thought . But when a boy is tender , he 's more tender than a girl could ever be . It was an evening after supper . Denny was on the floor shootingmarbles . Maggie-Now was reading Laddie , a book that had just come into the library . Patrick Dennis had read the evening paper . Now he was digesting the news . We 'll never get in it , he thought . Wilson will keep us out of war . If we did get in , though , I would n't have to go  --  a man of fortysixwith two children to support without a mother . I say let them kill each other over there . They 're all a bunch of foreigners anyhow . Why should we butt in ? He looked at his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , war will be a thing of the past . Maggie-Now . If she was a boy , she 'd have to go if there was a war . But there wo n't be . The worst thing that could happen to her is some no-good man will come along .. . He looked at his daughter . She had put aside her book and was on the floor helping Denny with his houses . She was twentyonenow and well formed . She 's a woman , now , he thought , and it 's just a question of time when she 'll marry and leave the home . The boy will start school  |p166soon  and he 'll grow up quick , and before you know it he 'll be out of the house , too , and I 'll be left all alone in me old days . He sat there and wondered what life would have been like were he friends with his children . He had to admit he had his lonely times . He would have liked to be one with them instead of the outsider who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no part in their secret lives . He wished now that he had started to gain Maggie-Now 's love and friendship when she was a little girl . Encouraged her to confide in him ; brought her home little surprises and made her laugh in delight in the way of children . In the warm , comfortable room with his children nearby , he was cold and lonely . Maybe it was n't too late . Maybe he could yet make friends with them . I 've never mistreated them , he thought . I 've given them a home and they have plenty of food and I watch that nothing bad happens to them . But why then does the boy stop laughing or talking or whatever he 's doing when I come home nights ? " Denny , " said Maggie-Now . " It 's time for bed . " " Maggie-Now , " said Pat , " after the boy goes to bed , sit down with your father and we 'll talk things over . " A look of alarm came over her face . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the supper ? I know the potatoes were n't mashed good because Denny kept bothering me . . . . " " No , no . I mean ... " " Is it my dress ? I did n't take money to buy a new one . This is an old one . I dyed it and put a new collar on . " " No . I just want to talk to you . " " About what , Papa ? " " Nothing . Anything . Just talk . " " Is something the matter ? Something I can fix up ? Just tell me what and I 'll try . " " Never mind , " he said . " Never mind . I just thought we could say things . I could say something and then you could say some-thing . " " Say what things , Papa ? " " Well , like I 'd say : Denny 's got red hair and nobody in me family or your mother 's family had red hair . Only Timmy  |p167Shawn  and he was no relation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help it that he 's got red hair . And he 's a good boy just the same . " " I did n't say he was n't , " shouted Pat , now exasperated . He sighed and got his hat and went down to the corner saloon for a beer . He had more than one . " You know , " he told the bartender , " I once had two of the nicest children a man ever had and I lost them . " " That 's the way it goes , " said the bartender . " No , " said Patrick Dennis Moore . " Denny goes to public school . " " But I went to parochial school , " said Maggie-Now . " Your mother wanted you to be with the Sisters . I let her have her way . " " I liked it and I know Denny would like it too . " " I do n't believe in mixing religion with education . Weekdays for school and Sundays for church . He goes to P.S. 49 . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be vaccinated . " Maggie-Now brought Denny to see Mr. Van Clees on the boy 's birthday . The cigar man had six blue candles for him . " I have another friend , " he said . " For her , pink candles ; six of them . Tessie came along two months after this young man was born . You know Tessie ? Annie 's little girl ? " " She was a baby when I saw her . How time flies ! And how is Annie ? " " She works still by the lunch counter in the five-ten . She has now bad trouble with her feet  --  standing up all the time . " " I thought she 'd marry again  --  a nice woman like that . It seems she 'd have chances . " " No . Gus was the only man for her . Maybe some man would like to marry her , alone . But three children ? " He turned up his palms and shrugged his shoulders.  |p168I  suppose , thought Maggie-Now , nobody will ever marry me because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but by that time , I 'll be too old . " And how are Annie 's other children ? " " Jamesie  --  he is in long pants now . " " No ! " " He is twelve and he is big . He works Saturday bringing the groceries to the houses for the man . " " That helps out a little . " " Ah , yes . And that Tessie ! My , she 's pretty . And so good ! But that Albie ! You know him ? No he was n't born yet , then . Almost four years old now . And bad ? Oh , my ! " " That 's a shame . " " He is bad because there is no father to say , No ! ' Was Gus still living . . . " He sighed , then brightened up again . " And you , Miss Maggie ? A fine young woman you are now . Do you keep company with some nice young man ? " She shook her head . " A pity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good mudder . " " I do n't have much chance to meet young men . " " Well , the boy goes to school soon . Then you have time for yourself . You go out then with the young girls and meet their brothers . Maybe you steal some man away from another girl . That 's the way to do it . Was I only a young man , " he said gallantly . Maggie-Now was flattered and embarrassed . " Now where did that boy go to ? " she said , frowning . " He knows I 'm taking him to be vaccinated and he 's trying to duck out of it . Well , thank you , Mr. Van Clees , for the candles and give my regards to Annie when you see her . " Maggie-Now was twenty-two . She was restless and lonely and needed young friends . Of course , she had old friends . Father Flynn was a friend but she was too awed by him ever to have the easy but respectful friendship her mother had had with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the storekeepersand neighbors who were her good friends , but they were all older than Maggie-Now . She longed for friends of her own age and generation.  |p169Of  course , there was always Lottie , but as Maggie-Now grew to womanhood she saw less and less of Lottie . The twins were living with Lottie now . Widdy , believing America 's entry into the war was imminent and being afraid he would n't be drafted ( because he had a wife and two children ) , enlisted in the navy . Gracie turned the twins over to Lottie and got a job and a room down near the Brooklyn Navy Yard . She liked to see the ships come in . Widdy might be on one of them . Lottie had her hands full . Her mother was old and senile and needed constant care as did the twins . But she loved the twins dearly and supported them and her mother and herself on Timmy 's pension . Lottie told Maggie-Now it was hard , sometimes , to make the pension " reach . " Sometimes Gracie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the twins away from Lottie . Lottie would cry because she missed the children . It always happened that , when Lottie got adjusted to not having the twins , Gracie brought them back again . Whenever Maggie-Now went to visit her , Lottie was in a turmoil . If the kids were there , she 'd complain about being overworked , getting no rest and the money not reaching . If the twins were away from her , she 'd weep for De Witt and Clinton , whom she referred to as " My little steam-y boats , " and she 'd tell Maggie-Now it was " like a big piece was ripped out of me when the little steam-y boats were taken from me . " Lottie still wore her hair in a pompadour , although that was old-fashioned now . She wore the same kind of dresses she 'd worn when her Timmy was alive . She no longer wore bustles and ruffles because , with advancing age , she lost the urge to be desirable . Maggie-Now did not enjoy poor Lottie 's company as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , and when MaggieNowwas with her the girl felt that her life too had been frozen , as far as Lottie was concerned , in the year of Timmy 's death . Lottie still told the same old stories about Big Red and Patsy Dennis and Kilkenny and the thrashing and Margaret Rose and the Moriaritys . Maggie-Now was tired of the old stories and she was irritated that Lottie 's world was fixed in those olden times and that she expected Maggie-Now 's to be fixed in the same times.  |p170Maggie-Now  got restless at the many repetitions of the phrases : " And that kept us sweethearts , " or , " So we stayed sweethearts to the end . " Maggie-Now did n't think it right that this aging woman still considered herself a sweetheart when Maggie-Now , who was in her early twenties , had no anecdotes about sweethearts . It was n't fair . The friendship waned as Lottie kept talking of the past and Maggie-Now kept wondering about the future . When Denny started school , Maggie-Now was at loose ends . She had many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of the house and the same old streets and stores and the same old people . She wanted a change  --  to see and to know new things . She got a little frightened . Why , I might get old and die before I 've ever lived , she thought . The girl was young , vital , healthy and had a normal sex urge  --  although she 'd never think of calling it that . She wanted to marry and lie in bed with her husband . She wanted to love and to be loved . She wanted children . She had her desperate moments when she wondered how she 'd ever get to know any man whom she could marry . No young men ever came to the house and she could n't pick someone up off the street . So she was all ready for Claude Bassett when he showed up . CHAPTER TWENTY-SIXCLAUDE BASSETT drifted into Williamsburg , Brooklyn . Nobody knew where he came from because he did n't say . He was tall and good-looking but a little too thin . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat that did n't match , which made him very conspicuous in a neighborhood where men wore pants , coat and vest all made of the same material . He smoked cigarettes , which made him suspect in a community where men smoked cigars or pipes or chewed tobacco . His speech was precise English on the academic or even lit/erary side . This was a strange affectation or was it a sort of defense ? After he warmed up to a person or began to feel at ease with someone , his English was just as colloquial as the next man 's . He had what appeared to be another mannerism . When one spoke to him , he listened intently for a moment , then cocked his head sharply sidewise . This gave the impression that he did n't want to miss one precious word of what the person was saying . It was very flattering  --  especially to women . They felt that he hung on to every word they said . As a matter of fact , he had a punctured eardrum which made him deaf in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp turn of his right ear to the speaker , in order to enable him to hear better . He cocked his head more for women than for men because men spoke louder and he did n't have to strain to hear . He would have been surprised to know that he was under observation as he walked the streets . He thought he moved about unnoticed in that strange , teeming , yet quiet neighborhood with its old-law tenements and new walk-up apartment houses and slanted-roof houses dating back to pre-Revolutionary times wedged in between the larger buildings . He would have been surprised to know that Williamsburg , along with Greenpoint , Flushing and Maspeth , still retained the customs and way of thinking of the small town . And he was a newcomer in a small town . Maggie-Now first saw him in Van Clees 's store when she went to buy tobacco for her father . Claude Bassett had some placards under one arm and a burning cigarette in his other hand . He was talking earnestly to Van Glees in a very educated voice and Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Claude gave Maggie-Now a quick appraising look when she walked in and then continued urging something on Van Glees . Maggie-Now gathered that the young man was trying to rent Van Clees 's store in the evenings for a week . She heard him mention " school . " Van Clees said " No , " looking with distaste the while at the cigarette in the man 's hand . Ingratiatingly , the man asked something about a card in the window and it was " No " again . Maggie-Now felt sorry for the man . She wished she could tell him he 'd get nothing from Van Glees while he held a cigarette , the way Van Clees hated cigarette smokers.  |p172Later  , Maggie-Now saw his placard in a grocery-store window . It announced a free course in salesmanship . " Earn twenty dollars a week in your spare time . Nothing to buy and etc. etc . " Classes were to start the following Monday and the place where instructionswould be given was written in ink at the bottom of the placard . Schools were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a parlor , a loft , a basement or a too-long-vacant store which could be rented for a song . Selfstyledteachers gave lessons in tatting , tattooing , singing , dancing , juggling  --  everything . There were lessons in marcel waving and in how to sit and stand and breathe ; how to make hair grow , how to get rid of hair growth , how to develop your bust and how to grow mushrooms in the cellar . So many teachers who knew these things and could n't get rich by knowing them thought they could get rich by telling other people how to do them . Those who took lessons or courses dreamed of being headliners in vaudeville like those other Brooklynboys , Van and Schenck , or a dancer like Irene Castle , or getting to be Miss Flatbush with a developed bust or being in a carnival to exhibit hair that grew in waves down to the ankles like the Seven Sutherland Sisters on the hair-tonic bottle . No teacher became rich ; no pupil 's dream came true . All that teacher or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . None of the schools lasted long ; a week or two or , at the most , a month . But they brought a little interest and excitement to the community . Maggie-Now decided to attend the classes . One , she was interested in making twenty dollars a week in her spare time . Two , she was anxious to get out , be with other people ; and , three ( she did n't fool herself at all ) , she wanted to see more of Claude Bassett . The school was an upstairs dentist 's waiting room on Grand Street . The dentist did n't practice nights and the waiting room just stood there and the dentist thought he might make a dollar or two out of it . The little room was crowded when Maggie-Now arrived.  |p173There  were about a dozen women there and four men . The women ranged in ages from eighteen to forty . The men were nearer middle age and one was quite old . There were n't enough seats . Five women sat on a wicker settee meant for three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly sidewise , turned a little away from each other . They looked like Siamese twins joined at the hip . The men sat on the floor . They looked awkward and ill at ease . The scent of Djer Kiss and Quelque Fleurs talcum powder and of Pussy Willow face powder and of sachet powder that smelled like sweet , warm candy filled the room . This scent was interlardedwith the acrid medicinal smell belonging to dentists ' offices . I 'm the only one , thought Maggie-Now ruefully , without cologne on . The women for the most part wore cheap georgette waists , transparent enough for the camisole , beaded with pink or blue baby ribbon , to show through , or crepe de Chine waists and long , tight skirts with wide , cinching belts . They wore beads and pearl button earrings and dime-store bracelets which filled the air with jingle-j angle . Their hair was arranged in the styles of the day : spit curls or dips or an iron marcel wave . The youngest girl , being the most daring , had a Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle . All seemed to have the same makeup  --  faces powdereddead white with two coats on the nose , painfully plucked eyebrows and mouths painted to look like baby rosebuds . Why , it 's like a party , or a dance , decided Maggie-Now , the way everybody 's so dressed up . They did n't come here to learn anything , she thought derisively . They came to get a man ! Listen to me , she chided herself . As if I did n't come here for the same thing ! " Good evening , " said Claude Bassett , who was sitting behind a small table on which were piled a dozen books . I know her , he thought . I 've known her for a long time . But who is she ? He smiled at Maggie-Now . She smiled back . He 's trying to place me , she thought . He does n't remember he saw me in the store . " I 'll fetch you a chair , " he said to Maggie-Now.  | " She gets personal service yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dentist 's lavatory and brought out a threeleggedstool . They stood a second , the stool between them , and looked steadily at each other . She sat apart from the rest on the low stool . Claude 's eyes roved over the others but always came back to rest on her . She wore a plainly made , russet-colored dress . It was high in the neck and had long sleeves and a full skirt . Her thick , straight , dark brown hair was in two braids wound around her head . He thought her mouth was too wide but then he realized it was not foreshortened by lipstick . In fact , she wore no makeup and no ornaments . She 's as wholesome , he thought , as an apple on an Indiansummerafternoon . She felt his interest . Oh , why , she moaned , did n't I wear my blue dress with the lace collar and cuffs and my rhinestone necklaceand a hat , and I must put lipstick on hereafter so nay mouth do n't look so big . He stood up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The jingle-jangle of the bracelets stopped suddenly and the waves of scent seemed to settle in the room like a fog . " This is a course in salesmanship . Salesmanship is the art of using friendly persuasion to induce people to buy merchandise that they are quite certain they do not want . " He paused . The " class " looked stunned . This unnerved him . He did n't know it was their way of paying absolute attention . He continued . " To sell , one must have a product and , " he paused , " personality . " He looked at Maggie-Now . " This is our product . " He picked up one of the small books . " This is The Book of Everything . " There was a rustle among the girls and a perfumed murmur of " Everything ? " " Everything , " he said firmly . From somewhere , he got a stack of matted colored lithographs . He held one up . " It tells you how to set a table for guests . " The picture showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty roses and silver and crystal with a turkey on a platter and champagne in a cooler . " How to fix a stopped-up sink . " He showed a picture of a naked sink . " How to dress ap175baby . " They saw a pink and blue and golden cherub in a lacebedeckedbassinette . " How to clean wallpaper . . . " Then he showed them the pictures as transferred to the book . There was some disappointment . In the book , the illustrations were two by four inches and in black and white . After extolling the book and illustrations , he went into the sales approach . " The best time to approach the prospect is after dinner when he is relaxed and in a mellow mood . " One of the men raised his hand . " Question ? " asked Claude Bassett . " I work in the afternoon , " said the man . " He means after supper , " explained one of the other men . " Of course , " said Claude . " Thank you . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book in the crook of your arm .. . so . You ring the bell or knock on the door and greet the prospect with a pleasant smile . Your approach is : I am ... " ' He looked at Maggie-Now . " What 's your name ? " he asked . " Me ? " she said . " Please . " " Margaret Moore . " Now , he thought , 1 know how she looks , I know the sound of her voice and I know her name . " You smile , then , and say : I am Margaret Moore . I live down the block a way and I came over to see how you folks are getting along . ' Allow the prospect to talk , and then , as if by the way , mention the book .... " The hour dragged on . Two of the men sitting on the floor played a surreptitious game of odds-and-evens with their fingers . The old man was sound asleep , legs spread out , back against the wall and snoring in rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fourth man sat with his chin in his hand staring moodily at the pattern of the oilcloth covering the floor . Maggie-Now sat with her hands loosely clasped in her lap with a serene half smile on her lips . The other girls leaned forward tensely , staring at Claude , not hearing a word he said , but trying subconsciously to project themselves as desirable females to the attractive male . At last , Claude got to the heart of the matter : making money . He told them that the first lesson was free . There would be four more at a quarter a lesson . At the end of that time , each would be given a certificate and a copy of The Book of Everything ,  |p176free  . They would then go forth and sell the book for two dollars . With that money , they 'd get two books from him at the salesman'sprice of one dollar per copy . They 'd sell these and buy four ; sell those , buy eight . . . sixteen . . . thirty-two . . . sixtyfour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all for an initial investment of one dollar and a little spare time ! Maggie-Now recalled the time in her childhood when she had tried pyramiding her capital . She had a weekly allowance of five cents . Wishing merely to double her money , she bought ten pretzels from the cellar pretzel baker at the wholesale price of two for a cent . She borrowed her mother 's market basket , stuck a stick in the end , put the pretzels on the stick and sold the ten that afternoon in Cooper 's Park . It seemed easy to double her money again . The next day after school , she bought twenty pretzels and managed to sell them although she had to stay out longer . The next day was Saturday . She debated whether to take her profit and quit or go on . She bought forty pretzels . She sold two . Then the rains came . It rained three days . The pretzels got soggy and MaggieNowlost not only her profit but her initial investment of five cents . In addition , her father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lieu of bread , for almost a week . Remembering , she laughed aloud . Claude looked up quickly . " You are amused , Miss Moore ? " he asked . " No . I was just remembering the pretzels . " " The what ? " he asked , astonished . He tilted his head sharply to hear better . " The pretzels . " ( Only she pronounced it the Brooklyn way  --  bretzels . ) He threw his head back and burst into laughter . The men laughed . The girls stirred and the room was full of jingle-jangle and disturbed layers of perfume . One of the men said : " She 's full of life . " Another answered . " Yeah . I wish my wife . . . " He put away the disloyal thought . " Anyway , my wife 's a hard worker . " The other girls relaxed their tense attitude of sweet attentiveness . They knew they had lost . This Miss Margaret Moore had captured the handsome teacher 's interest and attention . Theyp177whispered to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be found dead in a tacky dress like hers . " " I bet she made it herself . " " Yeah . Without a pattrin , too . " " And that old-time hair comb she 's got ! " " I could n't be forward like her . I 'd sooner die a old maid . " Claude tapped for silence . " All who wish to continue , please remain to register . " It seemed that everyone tried to get out of the door at once . When the smoke had settled  --  that is , when the waves of scent stopped swirling and the jingle-jangle died away  --  there were five people left behind : three women , the old man and MaggieNow . Oh , well , thought one of the women , maybe the old man has a nice son 1 can get to meet . Another , about thirty with graying hair , thought : He might have a brother . . . a little younger . The third one wiped her glasses and thought : It 's hard for a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  any man . Just the same , though , it 's better to sit here nights than to sit alone in that hall room of mine . Maggie-Now registered last , after the others had left . She wrote her name slowly and carefully because she knew he was watching her and she wanted to write nicely . Watching , he thought : Beautiful hands . Strong , shapely , capableand thank God she does n't file her nails to a point like so many women do . Why , oh why , she thought , did n't I take time to file my nails and buff them ? My hands must look just awful to him . " Thank you , " he said , when she returned his leaky fountain pen , the point toward herself , as the nuns had taught her to do . He gave her a slow smile . She grinned back . He stood up and took a deep breath . " Tell me about the pretzels , " he said . " I 'll put the stool away first , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked at herself in the mirror . She was surprised she looked the same as before because she felt that some great change had taken place in her during the evening . She searched her mirrored face and thought how queer it wasp178that she did n't know him at all and yet had that feeling that she had known him always . And how natural and right it seemed that they were alone together in this place  --  sort of like keeping house . She straightened the hanging mirror . She noticed some spilled face powder on the basin 's ledge and wiped it off with a piece of toilet paper . She pulled the roller towel down until a clean place showed up . Lastly , she put the seat down on the toilet The cubicle looked neater that way . She gave the place a last searching look before she left it . There ! she told herself with satisfaction . She went back into the waiting room and told him about the pretzels . She straightened the room as she talked . He 'd put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been put on the floor to make room for his copies of The Book of Everything . ) The magazines were piled helter skelter . She interrupted her story to cluck , " Tsch ! Tsch ! " while she stacked the magazines neatly . I hope she 's not a doily straightener , he thought . If she is , I 'll break her of it . " So I had twenty cents . . . " she went on with her story . She started to push the settee back to the wall . " No , no , " he protested . " You stand there and look pale and helpless while I move it . " " Helpless ? " she asked , puzzled . No sense of humor , he told himself . " .. Then you bought forty pretzels . " " And it rained ... " Under the settee , she found an orange powder puff lying in a little nimbus of face powder that had shaken off when the puff dropped to the floor . She threw it into the wastebasket . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have to get rid of it , " he said . " Compromising . Dr. Cohen may be married . " So may you , she thought . As if divining her thought , he said : " But I 'm not . " First she looked startled , then relieved . She finished the pretzel story . He tucked his books and pictures under his arm . They stoodp179at the door ready to leave . She looked around the room lingeringlyas some women are prone to do when they leave a room which belongs to them and which they had attended to . " Now I 'll wind the cat and chuck out the clock , " he said . " What ? " she asked , puzzled . Serious minded . 1 warn you , Bassett , he admonished himself , she 's not one to like joking . " Nothing , " he replied . " A poor joke . Something out of my childhood . " With her finger extended toward the switch plate , she paused . She had seen the dentist 's mezuzah higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood , , . Ida was a friend . Maggie-Now was in Ida 's kitchen , visiting just before supper . There were the candles on the table and the kitchen smelled of chicken soup and baked fish . Ida 's father came in from work . He closed the door , turned and touched the mezuzah with two fingers . " Why did he do that ? " asked Maggie-Now in a whisper . The father overheard and answered . " So we should n't forget , " he said . " This is a mezuzah . It holds the prayer . " Then he intoned : " Hear , oh Israel ! The Lord our God is one Lord , . " The prayer is here . I touch it and I remember . In the old times the prayer was written on the posts of the house . It was the Hebrew law . " He quoted : " And thou shall write them upon the posts of thy house . " " But we move away all the time  --  we Jews . We own no house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post  --  the house post that we carry with us when we move . " If Mama were here now , she thought , she 'd say , " And they touch the mezuzah the way we dip our fingers in holy water . " He noticed her abstraction . " Tell me , " he said . " As you said : It 's something I remembered out of my childhood . " Outside in the hall , she said : " It 's funny , but tonight seems to be the night for remembering things of when I was a little child . "  |p180He  was about to say that was because she was sorting out her past and putting it away because she had no need of it now that her future was starting . Instead , he said as they went down the stairs : " I do n't believe you were ever a little girl . " " Oh , yes . I was , " she said somberly . " And for a long time , too . " I told you before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And very literal , too . Down on the street , she held out her hand and said : " Good night , Mr. Bassett . I enjoyed the lesson . " " I have to go past your house on my way home , and , if I may , I 'd like to walk with you . " " I would like you to walk with me , " she said frankly . " Thank you . Now where do you live ? " " But you said ... " I warned you , Bassett .. . " Anyhow , we turn at the next corner and then it 's three blocks . " " Thank you , Miss Moore . It is Miss , is n't it ? " he asked suddenly . " It 's Miss ' all right , " she said . " All the men around here must be stupid or blind . " " Oh , no . " " Yes . Else you would have been snatched up long ago by one of them and put away in cotton wool . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her frank way . " No . No one ever asked me . You see , I have a brother and some people think he 's my son . ( He 's just started in school . ) My mother died when he was born . I brought him up . I mean , new people coming to the neighborhood think he 's my child and . . . " She thought briefly of the yard and the boy from upstairs . " Anyway , a man would n't want to marry a girl and take her brother , too . " She sighed . " Another thing : My father 's strict . He would n't let me go out with anyone . " " I 'd like to meet your father and shake his hand . " " My father ? " She was astonished . " But why ? " " For beating off all the boys and men . For keeping you locked up . I mean for keeping you safe for me . " He 's kind of flip , she thought critically , pleased that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad I found that out so 1 do n't fall in love with him so quick . Again , as if reading her mind , he said : " You think I 'm flippant , do n't you ? " " Flip . . . flippant ... ? " " Do n't you ? " he persisted . " I do n't know what to think , " she said honestly . " I never knew anyone like you before . I do n't know whether you 're serious or making fun of me . " " Of you ? Never ! " he said earnestly . " Really , I 'm a serious person . Or so I like to believe . I say things lightly . I mean , I say light things . I 've traveled around a lot , met many people , got to know none of them well and got into the way of saying things quickly and lightly . . . no time to really get to know anyone enough to be sincere . . . that takes a little time ... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a quick look . He decided she was n't being sarcastic . She would n't know how . " Quite a lot , " he said . " And you ? " " I 've never been out of Brooklyn , except ... " " San Francisco , " he said dreamily . " Cincinnati . . . Chicago , Boston . . . " " ... except once . When I went to Boston . " " I 'm crazy about big cities . Denver . . . a mile nearer the sky than other cities ... " Suddenly she knew they were n't in tune with each other . He was in a world of his own . She shivered . Someone 's walking over my grave , she thought . She stopped walking and he , talking , walked on ahead , not knowing he was alone . " Good night , " she called ahead to him . He whirled around and came back to her . " What happened ? " " I 'm home . " " What 's the matter with me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to overlook . And it was interesting . . about the cities . " " But you were n't interested . " " A person must say they are , anyhow . To be polite . But I'mp182not really . I like Brooklyn and ... anyway , I have to go in now . " " Not yet . Not yet , " he said . He grasped her arms as she stood on the step above him and he spoke rapidly as though time was short . " I wanted to tell you  --  I need to tell you so many things . " He spoke fast and breathlessly . " I want to tell you about the way you smell of good soap and fresh-washed , dried-in-the-sun clothes , and ... " " Oh , that 's only castile soap , " she said . " It 's cheap . They have blocks of it in the drugstore and you ask for a nickel 's worth and they cut off a slice . " " Your good healthy hair smell . And I wanted to tell you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it 's plain but I made it myself . I make all my dresses the same way because it 's the only pattern I can figure out . " " And the classic simplicity of your hair style . " She started to feel uncomfortable . She thought he was making fun of her . " I know it 's old-fashioned . But my hair 's so thick and stubborn , I ca n't make it curl like other girls do . " " If you do n't stop belittling yourself , I 'm going to call you my little Chinee . " " Chinee ? Why ? " " Because , in China , when you compliment someone on , say , a lovely jewel , he 'll say it has a flaw in it . Admire a Ming vase and you 'll be told it has a crack in it . " " Why do they do that ? " " It 's their way of being modest . " She was about to ask whether he 'd been in China . She decidedagainst it , fearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose him again . I 'm silly , she thought . Here I 'm afraid of losing him . When did I ever have him ? He 's just someone I met only a few hours ago . " Who 's modest ? I just happen to know that my dress is not in style . That 's all . " " It is always in style . A girl in a Portugal village wore one like it a hundred years ago . Tonight in London , a duchess is wearing one like yours . Only of white satin.  | " And those shining braids wound around your head : So Ruth wore her hair , perhaps , when she stood in the alien corn ... . And Narcissa Whitman . . . " " Who ? " " They opened up the Oregon Trail  --  she and her husband , Marcus . The Oregon trail . . . " He waited , his head turned as though straining to hear something from far away . " You say nice things , " she said . " But I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the other girls look at me . " " You are not of any time , past , present or time to come . You are of all time . You are forever . " Maggie-Now squirmed a bit . She felt uncomfortable . She thought his talk was sort of fancy . Did he mean all those things ? Or did he just like to talk to fill in time ? She was a combination of child and woman . At sixteen , she had been a mature woman with a woman 's grave responsibilities . At twenty-two , she was yet a child waiting to come into her maturity . She waited for the new thing which was just around the corner ; she clung to a few modest dreams . The woman and child in her walked side by side . In a way , she knew , as the saying goes , all about life . Conversely , she knew nothing about it . But she believed in so much . She did n't love all the people she knew but she believed implicitly that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as unkind and unloving . She believed he was unkind and unloving . That 's the way it was and she accepted him and loved him as a child should love a parent . She believed that Mr. Van Glees tried to put his hand on the life of everyone he knew . Sure , that made him intrusive and tiresome sometimes . But it was in the open . He did not try to be otherwise than he was . She liked him and believed what he said . She believed that Lottie and Timmy had been sweethearts all their life because Lottie told her so . She believed Annie was kind and good because Gus and Van Glees had told her so . She took it all on faith . Now came the first intimations of maturity . This man  --  holdingher arms and looking up at her : Was he to be believed ? Was he speaking true ? Did he mean all he said ? Or did he talk onep184way and think another . He spoke as people spoke in books . Was that natural with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethinghe put on like a coat ? How could she know ? In her characteristic way , she decided the only way to know was to ask him . " Mr. Bassett . . . " " My name is Claude and I hereby serve notice , " he said severely , " that I will not be called Claudie . ' " " You want me to call you by your first name ? " " I do . " Why , she thought , did n't he just say , Call me Claude ? " I could n't , " she said . " Not yet . I do n't know you long and Mr. Bassett is strange to me . Claude would be even more strange . " She paused . " What I started to say : Do you mean everything you say to me ? " " Why not ? " " I could understand better , " she said a bit timidly , " if you 'd say yes or no . " " Margaret , " he said sincerely . " I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I talk too much . But you see , it 's so long since I had someone to really talk to . But I mean what I say . Believe me , please . " " I 'm glad you do , " she said , " because the way you talk to me  --  you make me feel like a princess or something . And it 's a wonderful feeling . " " Thank you . " " Good night . " " Where you been ? " asked her father . " Now , Papa , " she said patiently , " after all , I 'm over twenty-one . " " I know how old you are . But I do n't know where you been . " " Good night , Papa . " She moved toward her bedroom door . " Listen , " he said to hold her , " did you use up all the housemoney yet ? " " I do n't know , " she said . She went into her bedroom . She acts funny , he thought . Like she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was out with him ? And she , what do n't knowp185nothing about men  --  what bastids they are ? I wonder does she know what she should know ? She must . Lottie or somebody must-a told her . He was relieved , then characteristically , he becameangry . Sure and they told her . They could n't wait . Damn married wimmen  --  always blabbing . Always disthroying innocence . Suddenly he felt old . This made him angry , too . He did n't want to be old or feel old . But if he had to be or even feel old , he was n't going to work any more . By God , he vowed , I 'll go out on pension . That 's what I 'll do . The old man will stay home all day . I 'll get in her way , he thought with satisfaction . That 'll fix her . That 'll fix everybody . He felt more cheerful . He took down from the shelf the broken-spout teapot in which Maggie-Now kept the household money . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar bills in the teapot and put it back on the shelf . He changed his mind , took it down again and brought it over to the table . He removed the bills and smoothed them out on the table . After a little hesitation , he took another bill from his pocket . He put the three bills side by side on the table where Maggie-Now would see them the first thing in the morning . He put the teapot on top of them so they would n't blow away . After Maggie-Now went into her house , Claude walked over to Lorimer Street to catch a streetcar . There was none in sight so he went into a bakery and got two doughnuts . He stood on the corner and ate them while he waited for a car . A newsboy turned the corner calling : " Extra ! Extra ! Read all about it . The President asks for war ! " Claude beckoned to the boy . " Do n't you know that according to books and stories you should call Wuxtry and not Extra ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and backed off staring at Claude as if he were a freak . I thought she had no sense of humor , thought Claude . But nobody seems to in Brooklyn . He bought a paper . The extra announced that President Wil/son had spoken before Congress that night at eight-thirty and had asked for a declaration of war . Claude felt a tingle of excitement . War ! he thought . He looked at the books and posters he was carrying , with revulsion . What am I doing with this nonsense ? he asked himself . ONLY Maggie-Now , three women and the old man showed up for class the next night . Maggie-Now wore her blue dress with the lace collar and cuffs and the new hat she had bought for the coming Easter Sunday . She smiled widely at Claude when she came in . She put her quarter on the table as the others had done . He looked up and frowned . Her heart sank . She thought perhaps he was offended that she had put a quarter down . He frowned , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made her seem like a stranger . The three girls were sitting on the settee , leaving the old man sitting alone in the middle of the room . Maggie-Now felt sorry for him . She took the chair next to him . Claude Bassett arranged the five quarters in a row , then in a circle . Finally , as if coming to a definite decision about them , he piled them one on top of the other . He stood up . " I appreciate more than I can say your willingness to come here again but . . . " He announced that the course would be discontinued . The enrollment , while interested , was small and there was the rent on the classroom and he smiled and said he did n't believe anyone would be interested in The Book of Everything . War was inevitable . . . he had decided to enlist . . . . He spoke at length . Maggie-Now thought : I 'll never see him again ! She envisioned him lying on the field of battle ; torn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be refunded , of course . "  |p187There  was a chorus of objections . " No . " " I do n't want my quarter back . " " You should get something for your time . " " You will have to pay the rent for these two nights , " said Maggie-Now . Everyone was friendly now and they spoke back and forth . The girl who lived alone in a hall bedroom took off her glasses and wiped them and put them in her lap . She had a suggestion . A sort of organization or club was badly needed in the neighborhood  --  aplace where people could get together and meet other people and just talk and maybe serve refreshments .. . " I mean , " she said , " could n't we just keep on meeting here nights and just sit around and talk ; read books , say , and talk about them ? I mean , it would be worth a quarter a night to me , " she said defiantly , " just to have someplace to go to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this girl , ashamed that one of them would display her loneliness so nakedly . " I do n't see any harm in asking , " she said . She put her glasses back on . " That is a fine suggestion , " said Claude . " Nothing would please me more , but ... " Again he spoke of America at war and the uncertainty of war years . They sat around for the rest of the hour discussing the war  --  touching vaguely on the changes it would make in the community and so on . At the end of the hour , he tried to give each his quarter back . There was great indignation at the idea on the part of the three girls . Maggie-Now and the old man did not press the matter one way or the other . Finally Claude said he 'd keep the quarters if each would accept a copy of The Book of Everything in return . The three girls accepted enthusiastically . They wanted their copies autographed . Claude obliged . His inscriptions were flowery , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief encounter .. . With gratitude for pleasant hours .. . With the hope that we shall meet again . . .
