The machine stopped . And suddenly in Manhattan 's lofty apartment buildings , 200,000 dwellers , some of whom are lords of a sizable part of creation during business hours , seemed as flustered and helpless as unshelled hermit crabs . Local 32-6 of A.F.L. 's Building Service Employes was on strike . Elevators stopped running , coal furnaces went out , and matrons were forced to open taxi doors themselves . <P> All along Fifth and Park avenues , proud doormen shucked off their uniforms and donned picketing signs ; their shoulders drooped perceptibly . Out of uniform many turned out to be shabby , nondescript men . <P> Businessmen labored up 20 flights of stairs , got to their apartments breathing heavily and looking as disheveled as molting chickens . Garbage piled up outside kitchen doors 26 floors above the street . No mail or newspapers flipped down outside the doors . Grocery boys refused to make high-altitude deliveries , and floor neighbors who had never before spoken got together to pool food supplies . <P> Docile Manhattanites , who put up with soot , noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , generally accepted their new ordeal philosophically . Tenants stopped to chat with the strikers , who wanted their work-week reduced from 48 to 40 hours , and $2.75 a week more for it . The landlords chatted with each other . They claimed that they were going broke , that they could not afford any added expenses unless there was an end to rent control . Their stand endeared them to neither the 12,000 strikers nor the tenants . <P> At week 's end , the landlords gave ground ; they agreed to submit the issues to a fact-finding commission . Strikers ripped off their picketing signs . Soon the streets were once more loud with the shrilling of doormen 's taxi whistles .
