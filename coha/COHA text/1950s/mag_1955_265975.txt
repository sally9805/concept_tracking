In a mock courtroom set up in Philadelphia for the American Bar Association last week , five news photographers busily took more than 300 pictures while a " trial " was in progress . The demonstration was staged by the National Press Photographers Association , which is campaigning to open U.S. courtrooms to news photographers ( TIME , June 20 ) . Taking pictures quietly , using high-speed film and other equipment that would not disturb the dignity of a court , the five photographers moved around the courtroom so quietly that many of the 300 lawyers present did not know a test was going on . <P> After the demonstration was over , without a single flashbulb fired , the " judges " turned in a split decision . " Very smoothly done , " said U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Herbert F. Goodrich . " Distracting a bit , but so is a pretty girl ... It might drive witnesses crazy . " But another " judge , " University of Michigan Law Professor Charles W. Joiner , found the picture-taking " did not distract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of relaxing the Bar Association 's canon forbidding photography in courtrooms provided that the photographers " do not try to tell the judge how to run his court . " <P> Next day Attorney General Herbert Brownell reaffirmed his stand that the question of admitting photographers to courts should be reopened . Said he : " There have been so many new developments in photography in recent years that I feel it is the duty of the bar to re-examine the ban . "
