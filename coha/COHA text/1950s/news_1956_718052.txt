txt Letters to The Times A. PERANDI , D.W. LAWRENCE.WILLIS PLAYER , HAROLD FAGGEN.GEORGE E. LARRABEE. pg . 22 Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A story that Associated ' Hospital , . Service of New York ( Blue Cross ) ? expects to dip into reserves to help : pay subscribers ' costs appeared in The Times of May 27 . It was based . on information from a top official of the organization . It is also welcome news to thousands of working people covered by union-management welfare funds having group contracts with Blue ' Cross . I submit , however , that re- ' serves accumulated by Blue Cross ' are sufficient not only to make arate increase unnecessary , but even : to permit an expansion of current services . Traditionally , progress in our free society means that institutions must keep up with require ments of the times recognizing the . needs of people and doing something ' constructive to meet these needs in an equitable and positive manner . On Sept. 1 , 1956 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds in New York Stater will command full disclosure of the operation of these funds . ' Since such ' funds involve large numbers of people , full disclosure is right and proper . I believe that similar full , disclosure of Blue Cross operations is in the public interest . Discount Rate The spokesman for Blue Cross , in accounting for discrepancies between amounts reported to the State Insure. ante Department as hospital payments made by Blue Cross in 1955 and amounts listed as " benefits " in reports to subscribers , spoke of discounts which Blue Cross receives , These discounts , which vary with member hospitals , are cloaked in a gauze curtain , and we can only spec ulate on the terms of Blue Cross contracts with member hospitals . If a discount to Blue Cross represents a hospital 's saving on billing and collection problems , is it not feasible for hospitals to establish a standard discount rate for guaranteed payment which would apply ' to selfinsured funds or carriers as well as ' to Blue Cross ? More than 40 per cent of New . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged full rates by each hospital . Hospitals publish these rates . Yet hospitals de not tell the public what discounts - they allow Blue Cross . Blue Cross announced that a program for 120 full benefit hospital days is available to groups which will pay an increase in monthly premiums from $1.60 to $2.20 for individuals and from $4.36 to $6.40 for families . A ' 1955 Blue Cross report indicated that , a 120-benefit-day plan involves an increase in payments of about 10 per cent . Yet Blue Cross is increasing individual rates by 371/2 per cent and family rates by 463 ; per cent . This is an ' indirect approach to a general rate increase . Hospital Stay - Of all persons covered by Blue Cross , approximately 8 per cent suffer serious illness which keeps them confined to hospitals beyond the twenty-one-day " fully covered " benefit period , precisely the people who can least afford additional drain upon their resources . As consultant to many unionmanagement pension and welfare funds , I am familiar with the costs of hospital care and with the role of Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that hospital costs are rising because of increased cost of services . However , the immediate challenge is improved benefits in line with actual needs and I am convinced that these can be provided right now . The public is entitled to full disclosure of Blue Cross operations , including " discounts . " Indeed , this is long past due . HAROLD FAGGEN . New York , July 6 , 1956 . Foreign Aid Opposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It is refreshing to observe the rising crescendo of indignation on the part of our citizens to the continued squandering of our substance abroad in our humiliating campaign of attempting to " bribe " foreign peoples to " our side . " When will this great nation regain its former dignity and character and proclaim to the world that this nation shall be strong , shall intelligently spend whatever is necessary to defend its citizens against any potential foes , mind its own business and give the peoples of the earth an oppertunity to again demonstrate their capacity to take care of themselves instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the sucker , " will continue to absolve them from the normal to industry and frugality ? incen tive To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It-is also refreshing to see foreign Here at the Air Transport Asso- peoples rising and ** our ciation your editorial of July 3 on paternalistic attitude toward them , air traffic control was read with and our officious interference with interest and with much appreciation . To our experts it seems plain that the provision of an air traffic control system adequate to the nation 's needs is essential to the future of American air power , civil and military . A series of discussions , conPosition of Baltic States Possible Change in Status Said to Be Only Change in Form ro THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Soviet party documents , published in the July 1 issue of The New York Times , reveal deviations of Stalin and his accomplices from the Lenin course in , the question of the " autonomization " or nationality policy of the Russian Communist party . According to reliable information the  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward subjugated nations is to be discussed in the Supreme " Soviet , which convenes on July 11 in Moscow . New decisions will be proposed unless , of course , the recent uprising of Polish workers in Poznan and the rather shaky situation in all the captive countries will make the Kremlin rulers feel the very raising of this question untimely and prejudicial to the " unity " of the Soviet bloc . In this respect the three , Baltic States  --  Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania ? occupy a specific position . They were early ? victims of the Stalin-Hitler secret deals of Aug. 23 and Sept. 28 , 1938 , and of flagrant Soviet aggression against these states committed in violation of international treaties and commitments legally binding the Soviet Union , Earlier Stand This Supreme Soviet , convening on July 11 , voted on Aug. 3 , 5 and 6 , 1940 , in complete disregard of the will of the respective peoples , the " admission " of Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia into the Soviet Union as " Soviet Socialist Republics . " These so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continuous aggression by the Soviet Union against the Baltic States . De jure , Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia are independent sovereign states , only the exercise of their sovereign rights on their respective territories has been made impossible by the Soviet aggression and subsequent military occupation . It is ? significant that reports emanating from Helsinki to the effect that Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania will be separated from-the Soviet , Union have been published recently in several European newspapers . Should the present collective dictatorship of the Kremlin , in ' their quest for Leninism , decide to annul the illegal incorporation acts , this would constitute merely a deceitful gesture in the directiofi of righting one major international crime committed by the Soviet Government under Stalin . Advantages to Soviet The advantages of such an action for the Soviet Union are obvious avoiding recurrent and worrisome charges of Soviet colonialism , preparing the ground for requesting three more votes in the United Nations , favorable psychological and political effect in the free world . For the peoples of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania it would mean only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their spokesmen in the free world will not cease combating Soviet imperialism and colonialism until free exercise of their sovereign rights on their respective territories and genuine freedom are restored .

New York , Jtily 10 , 1956. ducted over a series of ' years in and by such bodies as the Air Coordinating Committee and the Air Naviga ? tion Development Board , has left ; little doubt as to what the nature ' of the system should ' be . It is time now , many of us think , to stop talk ? ink and to start doing something about it . WILLI$ PLAYER , Vice President , Air Transport Asa sociation of America . Washington , July 9 , 1956 . ' Hospital . Insurance Costs Details in Operation of Blue Cross Deemed Necessary Age Limit on Drinking To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In a letter . published July 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of alcoholic beverages , Martin . L. Gross concludes with the following statement : " Let us stop this nonsense about the drinking age . If an 18-year-old is old enough to pick up a rifle to protect a politician sitting in a state house or a city hall , he is old enough to drink . " I submit that this presents a complete non sequitur in that there is no ' conceivablerelationship between the ability to operate a rifle and the right to drink . Furthermore , the reference to the " politician sitting in a state house or a city hall " reveals the emotional nature of the argument . Forty years ago the opponents of woman suffrage attempted to equate the ability to fight with the right to vote .. More recently advocates of lowering the voting age to 18 have used a similar argument , claiming that one who is old enough to fight is old enough to vote . - Let us stop this nonsense of trying to equate the ability to fight , or shoot a rifle , with all sorts of rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The qualifications for a good soldier have nothing to do with the qualifications for voting or drinking .
