When Franklin Roosevelt died on April 12 , 1945 , was he a civilian ? Or was he , as Commander in Chief of the Army &; Navy , a member of the armed forces ? Under the law it made a difference . If he was legally a member of the armed forces , a $1,332,588 trust fund he left for his children and grandchildren was going to get a tax refund of $340,672 . <P> James Roosevelt , the eldest son and a trustee of the fund , joined the other members of the family in renouncing all claim to the rebate . But the other trustees ( Basil O'Connor , F.D.R. 's warm friend , and Poughkeepsie Attorney Henry T. Hackett ) laid the question before the surrogate of Dutchess County , N.Y . <P> Last week Surrogate Frederick S. Quinterro gave his ruling : President Roosevelt died a civilian . " The President receives his compensation for his services rendered as Chief Executive of the nation , not for the individual parts of his duties , " he ruled . " . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or drafted into the armed forces . Nor is he subject to court-martial or other military discipline . "
