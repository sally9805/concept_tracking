txt Political pork is as untouchable in Congress as animal pork is in the Moslem world . This is not saying anything new . The totally quixotic and unrealistic effort by Senator Paul Douglas ( D ) of Illinois to pare about $800,000,000 of political pork out of the rivers and harbors section of the new federal appropriations bill merely underlines the fact . That is all Senator Douglas ever thought he could accomplish . That is all he has accomplished . But it is in order to notice that the paring of political pork would be ? could it be accomplished ? the way to make the one biggest possible savings in the current budget . We are headed straight for another unbalanced budget . Originally . President Truman estimated that the deficit would run to 55,500,000.000 . Now we get revised estimates . Due to falling off in revenue estimates . the deficit is expected to run to $6,700,000,000 . A A ; - Great and many are the postures of devotion to the doctrine of economy . Now is the time when you will read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called " economy bloc " that they intendi to trim the President 's btidget . The House Appropriations Committee has already actually cut $1,500 , - 000.000 from the budget figures : But candid legislators also conceded that " some " of these cuts " may " possibly be restored later . The ; word " may " used in this connection is a euphemism . It will be surprising if Congress votes less money than the President recommends . It will be quite normal if Congress , after all its talk of economies . " finally votes more than the President recommends . That is what usually happens . A A A Senator Douglas 's proposals never could have restored the budget to balance . At best , they would have canceled out a little more than half of the newly estimated increase in the prospective deficit . But squeezing pork out of the budget would help some . It would be an attack on waste . It could be an example . If Congress . would give up its pet rivers and harbors projects , it would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive branches of the government . While no one knows just how much money is wasted in the executive departments , the chances arc that an efficiency expert could prune out perhaps as much as the $800,000,000 in rivers and harbors waste . Of course the truth about this economy business is that no one group comes into court with clean hands . The farm bloc is all for economy at the expense of city dwellers . City dwellers can see the wrong in subsidies which pile up mountains of surplus potatoes , butter . eggs , sand peanuts . Conservatives see the objection to housing for the poor . The poor see reasons why the government should not subsidize business and industry . But no single group will forgo its own special variety of aid from the federal* trough for the sake of economy all around . A . Every group gets its own form of aid from the government  --  whether it be the peanut farmer of the South , the business subsidized by low postal rates , the airlines with a direct subsidy , the industry protected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension . Each is delighted to forgo the other man 's subsidy . But the total community is unable to agree to eliminate all subsidies . The end result is just the plain , unadorned fact that the American people , acting through their representatives in Congress , are determined to spend more money this year than they are willing to raise out of taxes on themselves . We could get a balanced budget by raising taxes . But we have n't a ghost of a chance of getting it by economies  --  not when Senator Douglas can rally only one voice to his side when he proposes to cut the most obvious examples . of fat pork from-the rivers and- har- ? bors bill .
