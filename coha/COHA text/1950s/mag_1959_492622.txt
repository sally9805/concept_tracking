I live in what is known as a " changing neighborhood " in Baltimore . In short , a Negro family has bought a house down the street . The color of my neighbor 's skin does not bother me at all . His income and behavior are just about the same as mine . But the economic threat his presence has created for me , and for the entire community , is disturbing . A lot of people who live somewhere else have assumed that our pleasant , middle-class neighborhood is headed for all-Negro occupancy and rapid deterioration as properties pass from financially strong hands to less responsible ownership . The pattern is a familiar one in many big cities of the North . We were enmeshed in the initial , frightening stages of this process just a year ago . " The dark cloud , " we were told , " had descended . " Our neighborhood , however , has refused to accept this verdict for the future . We believe that a mixture of white and Negro families is both inevitable and compatible with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle , in proving our point to date . The all-Negro " cloud , " we hope , may never descend simply because we and increasing numbers of Baltimoreans understand the forces at work , the threat to the future of the city and are agreed that some solution must be found . The most heartening support for our acceptance of racial integration has come from the Greater Baltimore Committee , a group of nearly 100 of the city 's business leaders . These men , until they were confronted with the problem of " changing neighborhoods , " had concentrated their energies on the rebuilding of downtown . Now , thanks largely to G.B.C. , a city-wide private agency is being created to work with neighborhoods like ours . We do not think for a moment that all the members of G.B.C. , or even a majority of Baltimore citizens , presently share our personal biracial views . But they are at least willing to listen and to consider our proposals for a solution . Neither can they deny that we have shown a measure of success . Enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting the all-white , all-black concept to bring the topic soberly out in the open , in the press and over the air , rather than have it confined to bitter words about " the black tide " or about segregation , voiced by one race or the other . The battle in our neighborhood , known as Ashburton , began with a young lawyer and myself . We and our wives  --  who got us together in the first place  --  were not content to sit , like birds mesmerized by a snake , and watch our hopes and homes wrecked , not by Negroes , but by block-busting real-estate agents and speculators . Block-busting , incidentally , in its simplest form consists of placing on a street a family whose class or race excites fear or prejudice in the neighbors , and then deliberately exploiting this prejudice to create panic and to depress real-estate values . It had become almost epidemic when we called a score of our neighbors together , organized the Ashburton Area Association , the first local association avowedly open to both races , and invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mailed early in 1958 to about 1100 homes , enrolled 400 members . Our meetings have been confined to small groups , covering Ashburton block by block . We had a typical evening gathering just a few months ago only two streets from my house . About twenty men and women met in the large living room of our block leader 's home . They were a fair cross section of any substantial middle-class neighborhood . Two of the men were doctors ; one was a lawyer . One of the businessmen was reputed to be a millionaire . Most had school-age children . There was a widow in her early fifties . " If you want to protect your home and your way of life , " they were told , " a simple solution lies open to you . You do n't have to join the Army and face death on foreign soil . You do n't even have to risk bodily injury . All you have to do is to continue living in your own home . " The speaker was a Negro . Intelligent , soft-spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in the group . " Do n't think you can escape the problem simply by putting your house up for sale and running away , " Otho P. Pinkett said . Pinkett lives in Ashburton and manages an 815-unit public-housing project in another part of the city . " Times are changing faster than most of us realize . Even if you move far out in the suburbs , I can virtually guarantee that by the time you finish paying off your next mortgage  --  and it will be a lot higher than the one you have now  --  you 'll face the same situation . There will be Negroes living near you . " As a matter of fact , " he added with a smile , " if this area turns all Negro , I plan to move out to the suburbs with you . " I think Otho Pinkett is right , and so apparently did some of my neighbors by the time that meeting was over . Two families who had indicated they intended to move said they would hold on for the time being . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as president . He is the big gun in the arsenal we have mustered either to change or to reinforce our neighbors ' attitudes . It is shock treatment , as a rule , when a Negro walks into a supposedly all-white meeting  --  and the shock , in turn , heightens the subsequent realization that Mr. Pinkett 's intelligence , sense of values , desires and plans for the Community are no different from those of others in the room . Melvin J. Sykes , the young lawyer I mentioned , and 1 also spoke to the block group , explaining our association 's campaign through the press , radio and TV against block-busting and our successes , us well as failures , in selling homes in the area to white families . I have participated in almost thirty of these block meetings in the past year . Two years ago I only vaguely knew the meaning of the term " changing neighborhood . " I had come from Hartford , Connecticut , to a public-relations job in Baltimore . The high percentage of Negroes living within the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent today  --  and my first impression of a " changing neighborhood " was that of a slum , or near slum , old and deteriorating . My wife and I , at the time we purchased our home , just could n't relate what we had seen elsewhere to Ashburton . It is a suburban-type neighborhood only fifteen minutes ' drive from downtown . Tall trees line the streets . The houses , built twenty to twenty-five years ago , are almost all single-family , detached dwellings , well kept , with ample lawns and gardens . Our home is one of the few " semidetached , " or twin , houses . We had spent months in house hunting , much of the time in the newly bulldozed developments in the suburbs beyond the city limits , known in Baltimore as " in the counties . " Our goal was a house of three bedrooms for the two children  --  a boy seven and a girl four  --  and ourselves , at around $20,000 . We went from one sprawl of look-alike ranchers and split-levels to another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure ; the travel time to my office was at least a half hour and generally more : the schools were mostly on double shifts ; and life with only one car looked rough . 139 We kept returning to Ashburton . It was , we felt , a handsome , mature neighborhood . The lots were larger , the houses more substantial and in no sense , other than their two-story height , out of date . We have , for instance , two full baths and two half baths in our home . And prices were about a third less than those asked for new homes with the same amount of space . No one pretended that Ashburton was still " fashionable . " Built as an exclusive " restricted " community originally , it saw a large influx of well-to-do Jewish families after World War If . In recent years , many began seeking newer , but certainly no greener , pastures . Ashburton today includes families of all faiths and ages . The business of finding and transporting baby sitters is no problem in an older community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are fine shopping centers just five minutes away . So we bought in Ashburton . We bought despite the warning of old-time Baltimoreans , " Did n't we know , " they asked in astonishment , " that Ashburton was gone , and that some of the blocks were already broken ? " No white person in his right mind would buy there . It was a shame that such a thing should happen to a nice place like Ashburton , they added , " but what could anyone do ? " Their lament for Ashburton was better founded than we realized . The first Negro in the area  --  a high-school principal  --  had bought a pleasant brick home in 1956 . Within twelve months , more than a score of Negroes , almost all professional people , had moved in . In the past year , another forty to fifty families have migrated to what the Negro community now refers to as " the Gold Coast . " This includes , in addition to our central-Ashburton area , another 900 dwellings  --  or 2000 in all . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 5 per cent of the neighborhood , but by normal Baltimore patterns a complete change-over should be only a question of two to five years more , maybe a little longer if a recession intervenes . By the time we got into our home late in 1957 , the process of change was increasingly apparent . Dozens of For Sale signs dotted the lawns , and two houses were rumored to be for sale for every one clearly marked . Many of these homes , it was said , were to be shown to Negro prospects only at night . Our new neighbors greeted us with more than usual enthusiasm , but almost from the first day wondered audibly how long they could hold out against the situation , even though they " loved the neighborhood . " The process was almost painful to watch . As soon as one house on a block was sold to a Negro , swarms of agents went on a house-to-house campaign , spreading the news and warning residents to put their houses up for sale " while you can still get the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Revere type would begin a doorbell campaign , or often telephone , with the information , " They 're corning , they 're coming . " Some brokers , when they got listings , refused to show the homes to white prospects . Specialists in Negro housing , obviously aware of the panic value , put up " sold " signs on homes which had not really been sold . A few speculators purchased homes in strategic areas and moved in low-income Negro families on a weekly-rental basis . Other overambitious Negro families were persuaded to buy under contract agreements requiring no down payment and monthly installments " just like rent . " The terms of these contracts , in most instances , made it almost impossible for the hard-pressed family to build up any H E equity or to put money aside for proper maintenance and repair of the property . The ads in the real-estate section of the newspapers openly proclaimed , " Ashburton  --  Colored , " even though our neighborhood was still more than 95 per cent white . The neighbors merely shrugged . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy in Ashburton . It was inevitable that the whites would move out and that within a few years Ashburton would be just another part of the expanding Negro core wrapping itself around the heart of Baltimore . And nothing could be done about it " because you ca n't change people . You ca n't make them live where they do n't want to . " We had no quarrel with that statement . But some of us began to ask , " Why , if we wanted to live here , should we be pushed out ? " Were inertia , panic and flight the only solution ? Mrs. Sykes and my wife , who met through the League of Women Voters , brought the four of us together one evening at the Sykes ' home to discuss our dilemma . The Sykeses had moved to Ashburton in 1954 , As Mel Sykes said , " I first thought the acceptance of Negro neighbors was an individual problem each resident had to settle for himself We made the decision , you did , and I am sure many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough . The change we 're prepared to accept has become a destructive rout . Our problem is essentially one of timing . The battle is not to maintain the status quo , but to eliminate the forces that produce disorder . " We found help right next door , in Windsor Hills . This community , which is older than Ashburton , contains a greater variety of homes , with a few apartments , built on winding lanes on a hillside , only minutes from the Hillsdale Golf Course . Its problems as a changing neighborhood had begun about a year before ours , and a long-dormant civic organization , the Windsor Hills Improvement Association , had been revived to tackle them . Sidney Hollander , Jr. , president of the group , recommended block meetings and active solicitation of white families to buy homes . " You ca n't afford ideology in your program , " Hollander told us . " The most ardent liberal will find that your association must discriminate , not against Negroes , but in favor of white buyers . There is no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this philosophy on the line in our first letter , asking for members and // financial help . " We welcome all good neighbors , " it said , " regardless of race , creed or color . But we understand , as we trust everyone will , that experience shows that the key to keeping up the quality of this or any neighborhood is to attract a sufficient number of new white homeowner families . " We began a series of newspaper ads to sell the advantages of Ashburton  --  until our money ran out . Mostly , however , we were busy fighting the blockbuster , calming our neighbors in meeting after meeting , steering them to decent , reliable real-estate agents , seeking ways and means to put an end to obviously shady practices . the neighborhood , as a whole , has pulled back from the edge of panic . Fifteen sales have been made to white families in the past six months , while Negroes bought perhaps twice that number in the same time . About fifty properties are listed for sale , which is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in some blocks had become completely demoralized , are back on a steady , though still depressed , level . Several homeowners began to take direct action against block-busting . They tiled complaints against one real-estate firm , asking the Real Estate Commission of Maryland to revoke its broker 's license for " misleading and untruthful advertising . " " They put a Sold sign on a house on our block on June twentieth , but they were still showing people the house in August , " said one complainant . " The purpose was to frighten the neighbors into the belief that Negroes had moved into the block , to obtain additional listings for sale to Negroes . " The complaint was backed up by the sworn statement of a Negro witness , who inquired about the property . " 1 asked the agent about the Sold sign on the house , " the witness said , " and he said not to worry about this  --  that the house was definitely not sold . If it had been sold he certainly would not show it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Sold sign first appeared . The Sold notice  --  usually a luminous , orange-red sticker pasted over For Sale signs  --  was as effective as a quarantine poster in spreading panic through a block . I use the past tense h. - cause our association , working with Windsor Hills and other areas , called on the city to enforce that part of its zoning ordinance which prohibits advertising signs in residential neighborhoods . The city solicitor ruled the Sold By signs illegal , and as complaints poured into the Bureau of Building Inspection , notices of violations were out and the signs disappeared . The Local Real Estate Board co-operated by instructing its members  --  which did not as a rule include the firms we objected to  --  to comply , but at the same time called for the drafting of an ordinance which would make Sold signs legal . The city council , as this is written , has not taken action . The most striking effect of the ban on Sold signs occurred in one block in which fifteen of twenty-three properties were posted as either For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action there were just six houses marked for sale . Windsor Hills has taken a step which our association has been hesitant to follow , but which now seems inevitable . Their real-estate committee has appointed a resident agent to represent them and to promote sales and rentals . The average outside agent is unwilling either to recommend the area to white buyers , or to risk his time on an obviously difficult , lengthy sale . " A sale to a white family takes endless discussions , " Mrs. Estelle Sachs , the agent , told me . " Most people who look in our area are liberal-minded , but their liberalism has to be strengthened . The person I am most afraid of is the one who says , ' Oh , this would n't affect me at all . ' This person almost always comes up later with an excuse that he does n't mind living next to Negroes , but his wife opposes , or his children are too young . " When you sell to one person , his friends become our best prospects-I am thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was close to where they worked . The couple did not mind the situation , but the wife 's family was dead set against it . They were East-ern Shore people and told me many times . ' They used to lynch Negroes there , ' and they did not want their daughter living anywhere near them . But the couple finally bought a house . That was three years ago , and the wife 's parents just recently came to ask if could lied a home for another member of their family . From that one sale , I had six other people who looked in the area and settled there . " Mrs. Sachs has helped sell twenty-five Windsor Hills homes to white buyers in the past three years , and has rented thirty others . " I have not been able to sell homes next door to a Negro , " she says , " although I can rent them . " Tie change has taken strange turns in Windsor Hills . Between fifty and sixty of its 600 dwelling units are now occupied by Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three apartments by the white owner , was sold to a Negro buyer who promptly restored the house to single occupancy for his young family . The Windsor Hills Improvement Association has several Negro members . Sidney Hollander went to see the first who applied for membership , to explain the association policy of encouraging white buyers . Sidney 's Negro neighbor said that was all right with him . As a matter of fact , he said , the day they moved into their home a big van also arrived next door . " I took a look and then called my wife , " he told Hollander . " ' Honey , ' 1 said , ' it 's a white man moving in . ' " Just as we in Ashburton are following Windsor Hills ' lead in selecting a real-estate salesman , Windsor Hills is considering formation of a corporation to purchase distressed properties in strategic locations for rehabilitation , if necessary , and for resale . They have a model in the operations of Bolton Hill , Inc. , formedby members of the Mount Royal Improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rim of the city 's central , commercial heart , has a great variety of dwellings as well as commercial districts . The Bolton Hill corporation has bought eighteen properties , usually in deteriorating blocks to prevent slums . They arc large dwellings , as a rule , and the corporation has converted most of them from shabby rooming houses to middle-income apartment use . The aim is to attract and hold substantial , permanent residents instead of drifters . Low-income whites and rapacious landlords have been more of an economic threat than Negroes in many blocks . Seven of the Bolton Hill properties have been improved and sold , and eleven are operated for rentals . " We had a seven-unit rental property in one block , where the property next door recently was sold for Negro occupancy . No one moved out of our refurbished house , " said John P. Mollett , president of the Mount Royal group  --  which is now biracial  --  and a Bolton Hill director . " We have found that if our association holds block meetings , and the corporation starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original owners will remain . " John Mollett 's comment was made at a day-long meeting , on the problems of changing neighborhoods , which the Greater Baltimore Committee helped sponsor late this past year . Real-estate brokers , bankers , city officials , civic leaders and representatives of nearly every neighborhood " protective " and " improvement " group in the city were brought together . Die-hard segregationists and liberal do-gooders eyed one another with suspicion , but heard the facts out.141 We  --  and I speak now for at least a dozen Baltimore neighborhoods which feel , as we do , that flight is not the answer  --  considered the meeting a major step forward . The city-wide agency that is growing out of it , backed by the G.B.C. , the Baltimore Urban League and the Citizens Planning and Housing Council , means that we arc not going to be left in isolated neighborhoods to fight the battle alone . We campaigned openly for this recognition , Our process of self-education in Ashburton was only a few months old when two points became clear . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes move in  --  if panic does not take hold . Dozens of families who are remaining can testify to this . But if the block-busters succeed , speculators sooner or later convert houses to multifamily rental units or open the door to downgrading by placing properties in eager but ill-equipped hands . The garbage collections that were sufficient for a single-family area become inadequate for the greatly increased number of families . The neighborhood ceases to oppose zoning changes that bring service stations , machine shops and other commercial establishments . Change and violations alike go unchecked under the city 's loosely written and poorly enforced zoning laws . The second point we learned was that no neighborhood association can solve the problems of change alone . The basic problem is that of attitudes  --  the attitude of the present homeowners , the attitude of the banks and mortgage lenders , the attitude of real-estate salesmen and , most importantly , the attitude of potential white purchasers . To change these attitudes , and to perform the educational job necessary to reverse tradition and prejudice , was beyond our scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion was both forceful enough to take action toward a meaningful solution and had good reason to do so was the Greater Baltimore Committee . Only a few months earlier the committee had proposed a bold , imagine tive$127,000,000 Charles Center . for the most part privately financed , which promises a major overhaul of the downtown business district of the city . The future of such a center , if ringed by miles of deteriorated neighborhoods in a city of low-income families , would seem open to question . I think , in this connection , of a comment by L. E. Larsen , president of the Allendale-Lyndhurst Improvement Association , on the attitude of residents in his area , which is primarily one of row houses . " Acceptance of Negro families would be much easier for our people , " he said , " if we had less commuting to and from work by car . You have to drive through deteriorated districts where the residents are one hundred per cent Negro . This sorry picture is hard to shake , even though the family a few doors down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color of their skin . " Both history and forecasts , however , point to no letup in the pressures which create such scenes . Baltimore 's Negro population , from 1940 to 1957 , grew from165,000 to about 280,000 . In that time only 6000 new dwelling units open to Negro occupancy were built , mostly public housing , Estimates show that , while the population of Baltimore city proper will not increase substantially in the next few years , the numbers of Negroes will grow by about 10,000 a year . The big population growth is forecast for the metropolitan area , outside the city limits , where only a few Negroes have been able to buy homes . The skeptics told us that G.B.C. 's hardheaded businessmen would never consider a problem as controversial , complex and seemingly unsolvable as that of changing neighborhoods , But we figured we had nothing to lose by approaching them . Even if we were turned down , the publicity would be beneficial . Our approach stressed not only the economic effect of neighborhood change on the city 's cultural , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families to support downtown rehabilitation and renewal . We asked G.B.C. to consider the opening of additional areas of new and old housing to the Negro residents ; a stimulation of public awareness of the practices that cause disorderly change , and to seek ways and means to enlist the cooperation of real-estate brokers in preserving the city . The reaction of the businessmen was as surprising as it was prompt . The G.B.C. first agreed to investigate " to decide what role , if any , we might play in solving this problem , " moved then to eliminate the words " if any , " and wound up with the recommendation that an agency be formed , in which G.B.C. would participate , to advance the measures we had suggested . They added to the list " providing special assistance , financial and otherwise , " necessary to stimulate renewed interest on the part of white purchasers in areas within thr city . " This is not just a racial problem , " said the committee , " but an economic one also . " As mortgage banker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the meeting where our " changing neighborhood " agency was born , " The root of the problem is fear  --  and experience is the only effective deterrent . " If 1 were asked to write a recipe for other cities , on the basis of our experience in Ashburton and Baltimore , the first item would be more housing available to Negroes of all income levels . If new developments in the suburbs were all on an open-occupancy basis , for instance , the pressure on any one would be small . The demand for middle- and higher-income Negro housing is going to grow , but is still relatively light . I alsoknow that older neighborhoods must be protected with strong zoning laws and active enforcement . If multifamily conversions are prohibited , and neglect prevented , speculation and profiteering will not be so attractive . Certainly more must be done to encourage white families to buy in the city , FHA mortgage insurance , for instance , has been almost exclusively used to make it easy to purchase a newly built home in the suburbs . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . We need both education and inducement to sell the advantages of in-town living , which arc many and becoming more apparent as suburbia continues to spread . Block-busting and related unscrupulous real-estate practices have to be fought . And neighborhood rehabilitation must be stepped up , simply because the conservation of existing homes is , in the long run , less costly than slum clearance . City government has neglected this field , both in encouraging rehabilitation and in protecting neighborhoods with code enforcement . The dilemma was well put by the person who said , " To save the city from the Negro is against my principles ; to save the city for the Negro  --  I have no enthusiasm for . " We hope in Baltimore to save the city for everyone  --  which 1 am sure is the only way it can be done . My Ambition is to Quit ca n't make the kind of money 1 make , but at least he can stay in one place all the time . It 's the money  --  and nothing but the money  --  that keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die in harness . I 'm like a boxer who lives for the time he can hang up his gloves , but ca n't afford to do it yet . He ca n't earn as much doing anything else , and neither can 1 . I do n't need anywhere near as much as I make to live on . But I do need what 's left over to provide a measure of future security for my family . Until that 's pretty well assured , I 've got to keep going . Then I 'll get out of baseball  --  and I mean totally out . 1 do n't want to be a manager , scout , coach , farm director , general manager , traveling secretary , league president , commissioner or batboy . My ambition is to be a fan , with the privilege of going to a ball game because I feel like it . not because it 's my business . I 'll have some good baseball years left when I do hang up my spikes . I 'll always envy Al Rosen , the Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of thirty , long before he had reached the end of the trail . When I first heard he intended to get out , I did n't believe it because I did n't think anyone else in baseball felt the way 1 did . " I 've had it , " he told me one day in 1955 . " I 'm going to retire at the end of the season . " " I 'll beat you to it , " I said . " You 'll still be playing long after I 'm through . " meant it . 1 really thought he would . But Rosen stuck to his decision . I 'm still waiting for the time when I can do the same , and settle down to a normal family life with my wife and children .

Well , I 've got a little measure of fame and a certain amount of fortune , and I 'm still not satisfied . Baseball , I 've discovered , is no game for devoted family men .
