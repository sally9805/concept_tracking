Symphony orchestras are constantly in trouble , artistic as well as financial . Last week some 400 delegates including representatives of 75 orchestras attended the American Symphony Orchestra League Convention in Providence to try to find out why . Influential U.S. Composer Aaron ( Appalachian Spring , El Salon Mexico ) Copland pointed out the nature of the problem : orchestras are not playing enough music of their own day to attract music lovers . Year after year , he said , major U.S. orchestras play only five or ten out of some 150 new orchestral works composed in the country . <P> " If present policies continue , " said Copland , " then we 're all headed for some kind of dead end . " Most orchestras seem " just happy to get by " with programming that is " repetitious and unexciting . " No other art form shows such an imbalance between the old and the new , he said . Business always seems to find time and money for research and development ; orchestras never do . " You ca n't make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can create a kind of museum , but not a living art . " Copland said he knows one talented young composer who has won eight prizes , but not a one of his works has ever been performed by an important music group . <P> Why is modern music neglected ? The answer traditionally given by orchestral conductors , managers and boards of directors is that the public does not like the stuff . But before the meeting was over , the league turned up figures suggesting that the public may like contemporary music better than officials think . Some impressive statistics came from Manager Ralph Black of Washington 's National Symphony Orchestra . Highlights : In five seasons , the proportion of new works performed by the National has increased from 18% to 30% of the total number of compositions for the year ; 14 out of 20 concerts last season included new works . <P> Single-ticket sales for events featuring new music increased from about half the season 's average in 1951-52 to better than average last season . <P> The presence of contemporary music has become almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling in about 15% more listeners than a concert with neither soloists nor novelties . <P> Although Washington 's figures settled little-until backed up by other orchestras - they were called a " bombshell " by many delegates , who wondered if they had not been kidding themselves about modern music and modern music listeners .
