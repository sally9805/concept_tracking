txt ' sIn the Formosa Strait the United tates Seventh Fleet has now gone into action . Ittis not covering an invasion of the mainland of China . It is not attacking the Chinese Communists . It is undertaking to protect a peaceful withdrawal ? as we hope it will be ? of a Chinese Nationalist garrison from the Tachen island group , together with as many civilians as wish to seek refuge on Forniosa . This is not a belligerent action . It is not designed to increase Far Eastern tensions . On the contrary it is designed to lessen them . We are giving routine support to the evacuation of a Nationalist outpost that had more ; . potential for danger than it had of - military value . The Tachen group is farthest from Formosa of the island positions on the mainland coast that have been held by the Nationalists since 1949 . It is close to two major airfields on the mainland . It can be attacked mercilessly . if the Communists choose to attack . It can , in the best judgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to pay the casualty price for its reduction . Hence , it has been decided in Taipei and Washington that a withdrawal is the correct order of military business . Moreover , there is no legalistic problem involved . The status of these offshore islands has never been ' in dispute . Unlike Formosa and the Pescadores , they are and have been Chinese territory , held by the Nationalists since their defeat on the mainland . where is , however , an important personal factor that is involved . American strength will ' be used not only to cover the redisposition of the garrison but also to effect the evacuation of as many of the some 15 , - 000 civilians as wish to leave the Tachens . This seems to us to be a vital part of our whole mission in the Far East . We will not allow persons who wish to choose freedom to be forced into an unwilling . slavery . It is , of course , entirely possible ' that the Communists will attempt military interference with the withdrawal . They are figuring calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on American forces , sea or air , . by the Communists , there will be , we may be sure , prompt and vigorous American response . We are not , however , initiating any attack and we have made it plain that our forces are being used , defensively , in what is under any definition a non-aggressive enterprise . It is important that there should be no confusion at this point between the " - attack on an American reconnaissance plane in the Korean theatre by Russian-built MIG 's and the FormOsa Strait problem . What happened there was also a defensive operation . An American survey plane , in international waters , was attacked . The attackers were resisted , just as we plainly said they would be , and two Of them were shot down . This is not the first case of a Communist attack in an international area . It will probably not be the last one . Meanwhile , we have said what we would do and in ' - this case we have done it We have defended our aircraft in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on patrol . This incident does not . modify in the slightest the basic issues that are involved in the Formosa Strait area . Naturally , it creates a more difficult atmosphere in which any accommodation could be reached , but that atmosphere had already been made explosive by the time to accept the homespun advice to " keep your shirt on . " We are not looking for trouble . We are not engaged in the sort of " warmongering " that seems to exist in the imagination of the British leftists as the great international bugaboo . In- the case of the Tachens we are taking a positive action to relieve tension at a danger point . In the case of the Korean incident we have taken precisely the action that we said we would take in the face of enemy hostility . We are happy over the fact that our strength makes it possible for the civilians on the Tachen islands to make a choice . We should have a bad conscience if we turned them over to slavery under the Communists . They will have a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will I have a chance for freedom . They , too , are worth the calculated risk .
