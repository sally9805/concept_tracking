To New York last week came a distinguished Indian visitor seeking money . But unlike some visitors , this one wanted not a handout from the U.S. taxpayer but a private loan . Lean , handsome Jehangir Ratan Dadabhoy Tata , 53 , chairman of Tata Enterprises , was looking for an additional $17.5 million of private financing for a 700,000-ton expansion of the Tata Iron &; Steel Co. works at Jamshedpur , India . Topping a 500,000-ton addition under way , the expansion will raise steel output from 800,000 to 2,000,000 tons by late 1958 , make the plant by far the largest integrated steel mill in the sterling area . No one doubted that the reputation and credit of Tata would win him his additional funds from U.S. banks and investment houses , which the World Bank would match with a loan . <P> To steelmen and to all Indians ( except Communists ) , Tata symbolizes one of the world 's great success stories . The founder of the family fortunes was Jamsetji Tata ( 1839-1904 ) , son of a Bombay merchant . Jamsetji @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to India and started a cotton mill . The mill grew into other enterprises . To cap his lifework , Jamsetji dreamed of starting an iron and steel mill . He died before his plans could be carried out , but three years later , in 1907 , his sons started such a mill . Informed of their plans , Sir Frederick Upcott , chairman of the board of Indian Railways , said that Indians were incapable of making steel , swore to eat every pound of rail produced . When British banks refused to finance the Tatas , they turned to their own people . Shopkeepers and maharajas stood in line to invest the fabulous sum of $9,000,000 . <P> Crisis for Nationalists . From these small beginnings in the jungle at Jamshedpur , the Tata mill has become the core of a $320 million complex of more than 25 companies with 150,000 employees , 1956 sales of $155 million . Like other Indian businessmen , the Tatas strongly supported Indian independence . When it came , the Indian government was under strong pressure from the left to nationalize Tata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tatas ' life insurance business , which the government did take over , nationalization schemes came to naught . The chief reason was that if India bought out Tata Steel it would not have funds to finance more steel capacity . The government decided to call in Russian , West German and British engineers to build three government-owned steel plants , let Tata live . <P> The Tata company promptly set in motion a $250-million expansion program readily financed in rupees by its stockholders . But trouble quickly developed when the government said it could not provide foreign exchange to cover $130 million worth of goods and services purchased abroad . At this crisis the World Bank agreed to lend $75 million , and J. R. D. Tata set about raising the rest , had just about finished the job last week . <P> West of Calcutta , where the Tata plan and the three government steel mills an racing to completion , the Tata plant is the one most nearly finished . Kaiser Engineers Division was hired by Tata to handle construction and engineering ( since Jamsetj Tata 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicians ) , assembled a work force of 14,000 Indians who put in 18 or more hours a day . The new section will pour steel next summer .
