Among the G.I.s of the U.S. 's Far East Command , the capital city of South Korea is rated as a real suzushii ( cool ) town . Fraternization is the order of any evening in Seoul , and the frizzled heads of willing young Korean misses , in military tow , bob around town in jeeps , and bend over ice cream cups at the snack bars . If an officer prefers a " stateside reject " - his term for the Caucasian girls from the civilian relief agencies-he takes her to " Round Eyes Night " at Seoul 's baroque Chosen Hotel . But " Moose Night " is more popular . Then the brass show up with their " musume " -a Japanese word whose literal translation , " daughter , " has been indescribably enriched by U.S. troops . <P> Last month a disapproving shadow fell athwart this happy scene . It belonged to Lieut . General John H. Collier , 56 , new deputy commander of the Eighth Army . One horrified look around , another at Seoul 's roster of prostitutes ( 4,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 31 , no more moose in Collier 's officer clubs . The order was obeyed-at clubs within his command . Collier 's Eighth Army officers merely mounted new assault waves on Moose Night at the Chosen , controlled by the tolerant Korea Civil Assistance Command . <P> Last week , hands trembling in frustration , Collier lifted the ban . Henceforth his officers could squire whom they choose - but he hoped they 'd be choosy in Chosen . Said he : " Standards of acceptability in Eighth Army clubs in Korea are the same high ones normally established in officer clubs throughout the world . "
