The best economic news in the U.S. last week , bar none , was the boom in U.S. agriculture . From all over the country reports trickled into Washington showing that the farmer , after being the lowest man on the economic totem pole since 1955 , is making an astonishing comeback . Agriculture Department experts scarcely dared believe some of their own figures . As of mid-April , the prices that farmers get are up 9.8% over the same time last year .

Items : <P> Thanks to a brisk competition between steak-hungry consumers and farmers trying to rebuild their drought-depleted cattle herds by holding back or buying up heifers , beef prices were running 30% above last year , spreading joy from Texas to the feed lots of Kansas City . <P> Hogs were up 20% above last year and holding long after most farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corn belt reported the most favorable corn-hog ratio in history-up to 25-1 . ( Usual make-money point for hog raisers is when 1 cwt. of live hog sells for 12 bu. of corn . ) <P> Even the egg-a big thing from California to Delaware-was selling for 25% above last year , so high that many poultrymen feared consumers might rebel . <P> Partly because of the Florida freeze , but also because of continued high food demand from city folks , fresh vegetables were selling 40% higher than last year . <P> And the once heavily subsidized potato was selling , unaided , more than 150% higher , carrying the new farm prosperity all the way up to Maine 's Aroostook County . <P> Main Street Evidence . But as far as the general U.S. economy was concerned , the best evidence of farm recovery was on the main streets of farm towns . In Oskaloosa , Iowa , a typical Midwestern farm market town ( pop . 11,000 ) , where farmers long were sullen and resentful over drought and low farm prices , TIME Correspondent Jonathan Rinehart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manager Ernest Dilley of the Thriftway Supermarket reported that farm wives , in a delicate shift in buying habits , suddenly had taken to buying cake mixes , scorning the economies of blending their own . Manager John Liley of the local J. C. Penney store gloated : " We had the best April we 've ever had . " Predicted Mrs. Gilbert Howarth of Howarth Sales &; Service : " Last year we sold 15 air conditioners . This year we expect to sell 20 .
