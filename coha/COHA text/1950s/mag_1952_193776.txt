The reverberations of Governor Dever 's keynote speech had scarcely died away , before the Democrats were locked in a bitter struggle . Contests over rival delegations from Texas and Mississippi were made the excuse for the fight-but the cause lay far deeper . <P> Most of the Southern Democratic leaders resolved many months ago not to encourage a repetition of the 1948 Dixiecrat revolt from the party . Instead , they hoped to mobilize their minority strength in such a way that the majority would listen to their pleas for compromise and consideration on both the platform and the choice of candidates . Their mobilization took two forms : 1 ) the candidacy of Georgia 's Senator Russell which corralled most of the Southern delegates ; 2 ) moves in various Southern states to leave the way open for revolt if the pressure of Russell 's delegates on the convention was overridden . <P> The Northern liberals , led by Averell Harriman 's campaign manager , Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. , and whooped on by Big Labor , decided to break the Southern bargaining power at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fight by proposing a rule ( similar to the Republicans ' " fair play " Langlie amendment ) which would have prevented the " regular " Texas and Mississippi delegations from voting on which contested delegates should be seated . The Southerners ducked that fight by agreeing to the rule . <P> The liberals then went much further . Through Michigan 's Senator Blair Moody they offered a resolution refusing seats in the convention to delegations that would not agree to a pledge . The promise : to try " by every honorable " means to see to it that the candidates picked by the national convention were placed on state ballots as Democrats . <P> Georgia 's Governor Talmadge said flatly that his delegation would make no such pledge because it would be contrary to Georgia statute . Nearly all the Southern delegations , except Alabama and Tennessee , spoke in bitter opposition to the amendment , warning that the party would lose the South to Eisenhower if the liberals persisted in insulting the South . <P> Even Harry Truman 's warm friend , North Carolina 's Jonathan Daniels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party from " the great crusade it is our duty to lead and instead will cause us to go down to almost certain defeat in November . " <P> Speaking against the Moody resolution , North Carolina 's onetime governor , onetime U.S. Senator Cameron Morrison said that he believed himself to be the oldest man in the convention , " 83 in a few days , and a lifelong Democrat . " He concluded : " My God , deliver me from such tyranny as this over the minds and the hearts of the Democrats of this country . " <P> But F.D.R. Jr . said that he would " guarantee " that if the Moody amendment was adopted " another general will fade away " in November . <P> The Southerners tried to compromise with a resolution , suggested by Daniels , that all delegates should support the party convention decisions " here and hereafter . " The Northern liberals , out for blood , would have none of it . <P> Chairman Dever summarily refused a rollcall , ruled the Southern compromise beaten and the Moody amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
