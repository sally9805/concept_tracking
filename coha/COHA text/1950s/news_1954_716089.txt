txt Residents of Maine 's capital city are determined to settle the Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Protect once and for all . The controversial project for harnessing the tides of Passamaquoddy Bay for power has been the plaything of politicians since Dexter P. Cooper . a hydroelectric engineer , first sold President Roosevelt on the idea in 1934 . Construction was started in 1936 and then halted under a barrage of Republican charges of wasteful New Deal spending . Now under a calmer atmosphere and without a word of debate , the Senate has appropriated $3,000,000 to conduct a joint survey with Canada to see if the project is feasible . It now awaits House approval . " Now we are going at it in the right way. , " commented Sumner T. Pike , chairman of the Maine State Power Commission . He said Maine does not want the project built . if it is not practical , and the only way to find out if it is is to spend money on a survey . Vote Trade Denied That is the same attitude he has met throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Passamaquoddy is located . " If you want to be against it or doubt it , just do n't live in Washington County , " he said . There is much talk that Maine 's two Republican Senators , Margaret Chase Smith and Frederick G. Payne , traded their votes for the St. Lawrence Seaway Project for the Passamaquoddy Project . Commenting on Senator Smith 's vote one man said : " I believe its the first time Margaret has traded a vote , but it sure was a good time to do it . " Both Senators , however , have publicly denied any trades . Even private power interests are in favor of the survey . Harold F. Schnurle. vice-president of the Central Maine Power Company , the largest in the state , said his company and other power industry leaders were all for the survey . " We would be foolish to say we were for construction of the project before it is determined if it is economical , " he said . But he favors a survey to determine ( 1 ) if it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be , ( 3 ) how the power would be used . Private Companies ' View To emphasize that there was no feeling against the survey tram the power companies , Mr. Schnurle pointed out that as chairman of the Maine State Development Commission , he was in charge of publishing a booklet boosting the study . But a common feeling met in Augusta is that once the federal government has determined if Passamaquoddy is practical , either private interests or the state government and Canada should handle the construction . " We only want to build it if it is going to be a paying proposition , " Mr. Pike said , " and if it is going to pay there is no reason why private interests should n't build it . " He estimated that if the survey showed the power would cost a cent for a kilowatt hour it should be forgotten . But , he said , if it were two mils per kilowatt hour it would he a profitable enterprise . A five-mill cost would be about the border line . He also saw no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the state . Passamaquoddy power would not serve the whole state and would probably have to he transported over private lines , he pointed out . High Cost Sighted Private companies might even find it a cheaper source to get power to sell , he said . The project is expected to develop 3 billion kilowatt hours a year . Mr. Schnurle said that he did not have too great a hope for the practicality of the project , because in the opinion of many private engineers he had talked with it would be too expensive to build . Also , he said , cheap power is not as great a factor in drawing new industry as it is made out to be , He said a survey showed that power was only 2.3 per cent of the textile industry 's cost , 3.9 per cent of the paper in industry 's , and 0.5 per cent of the boot and shoe industry . All these industries are predominate in Maine , where power is considered expensive . Transportation and available labor pool are greater factors in locating industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer there , he said . The Eastport area , which would benefit most from the project , is reported to be in the throes of an economic depression and desperately in need of new industry . Called by Seasonal Lao . One sardine packer , upon whose company much of the town is dependent , said he thought the hard times were no more than seasonal lag in sardine packing , made particularly harsh by a poor catch for the year , Mr. Pike said Passamaquoddy 's biggest advantage to Maine would be to take up some of the load on already taxed private Power developments . He said Wyman Dam on the Kennebec River , considered Maine 's finest , can only operate at peak capacity for one month Of the year , because at other times there is not enough water flow . " Steam generating plants have to be located nearby with at least three-fourths the capacity to insure steady power . " The same condition prevails over the entire state , he said .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
