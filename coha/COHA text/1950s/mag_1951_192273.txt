During the Cretaceous period , when mammals were still furtive , slinking creatures , the mighty dinosaur , king of the reptiles , ruled the earth . Then about 60 million years ago , the last of the dinosaurs vanished . The mammals inherited the earth and have bossed it ever since . Some geologists believe that the dinosaurs were too specialized to adapt themselves to a sudden change of climate . The trouble with the theory has always been that there is no way to prove that the climate really changed . Last week the University of Chicago 's Dr. Harold Urey told a Los Angeles meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science how he hopes to solve the ancient whodunit . <P> Famed Chemist Urey ( Nobel Prize , 1934 ) proved three years ago that certain fossil sea shells can be used as fossil thermometers to measure " paleotemperatures . " His method takes advantage of the fact that normal oxygen contains two stable isotopes , oxygen 18 and oxygen 16 , in the proportion of 1 to 500 . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build its shell , the proportions of the oxygen isotopes in it vary with the temperature of the sea water . The warmer the water the less oxygen 18 is built into the shell . <P> By measuring the percentage of oxygen 18 in fossils , Urey showed that the seas around Britain , now cold , could have been as warm in Cretaceous times as tropical seas are today . This indicates that the whole earth was warm at that time , and therefore fine for furless , cold-blooded dinosaurs . Urey 's next job will be to measure the temperature of the Eocene period that followed the Cretaceous . <P> As a start on the job , Dr. Urey this year went to Egypt , which was covered by the sea during both geological periods . In many parts of Egypt and Israel , the rock layers formed during the transition from the Cretaceous to the Eocene are very easy to identify . They contain few fossil shells , for life was apparently scarce at that time . But Egyptian and Israeli paleontologists have promised to send him suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climate-change theory is correct , the fossils will show that Cretaceous mollusks lived in warm water and Eocene mollusks in colder water . <P> Testing the shells for oxygen isotopes will take a long time . But when the job is done , Urey hopes to know whether a change of climate , or some other disaster , wiped out the mighty dinosaurs .
