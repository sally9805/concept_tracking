Last Tuesday evening Donald Campbell , 34 , son of England 's late speed king , Sir Malcolm , squirmed into the narrow cockpit of his jet-powered speedboat Bluebird and eased his foot down on the throttle . The green quiet of the Lake Country was shattered by the hollow jet boom as the aluminum hydroplane , looking like a giant modernistic lobster , nosed out onto the glassy surface of Lake Ullswater . The run began as just one more in a series of tests young Don Campbell has carried out on the revolutionary jet boat ( diagramed on these pages ) in which he is determined to bring back to Britain the world water speed record once held by his father . // On Tuesday evening he planned to hold Bluebird to a moderate speed , close to his father 's old record of 141 but still 37 mph short of the world mark now held by Stanley Sayres of Seattle . But as Bluebird taxied round a bend onto the lake 's long straight stretch , Campbell , for the first time in six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The water was right , and things were going very well , " he said later , " so I let it accelerate . " // In one tremendous burst Bluebird leaped from 120 to 180 miles per hour  --  faster than the existing record  --  and kept moving . At that incredible water speed the boat lost some steering stability , and inside the cockpit Campbell felt Bluebird sliding dangerously . Crackling over the radiophone to aides ashore came his voice : " I 'm not enjoying this ! " Then , as the air-speed needle shimmered past 180 mph he shouted , " I 'm getting one hell of a ride . " // Not even " full out , " Bluebird had topped the listed world 's records . All that remained now was to make it official with a two-way run over a measured mile against stop watches . // Suddenly close at hand , this final moment has , for Donald Campbell , been a long time in coming . Since Sir Malcolm 's death in 1949 , Donald has pursued the world record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 150 when the gearbox ripped apart . The following year the engine broke up under prop riding . The next summer Bluebird hit a submerged timber that ripped a 12-foot gash in her hull . Meantime Stan Sayres had taken the record to America with Slo-Mo-Shun IV , raised it to 178.5 . That appeared to be the limit for propeller boats , and especially for conventional hydroplane design . For at those speeds the broad forward surfaces of a hydro catch the air and the boat tries to take off . // In designing a new Bluebird , Campbell made a radical design change , substituted separate floats for the usual broad planing surfaces , cutting the dangers of flight tendency . For his power plant he picked a jet . But even as the new Bluebird was abuilding , a jet boat driven by Campbell 's friend John Cobb nosed under at 200 mph , exploding and killing Cobb . There was , apparently , another danger that no one really understood  --  a water barrier much like the sound wall encountered by jet aircraft  --  which sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boat approaching 200 . Once the vibrations take hold , the boat may go into an uncontrollable pitching cycle and disintegrate . // The new Bluebird was built to take these strains . With an aluminum-alloy skin strengthened by corrugations to withstand a wrench of 27 Gs , she is a near-perfect speed machine . She is not perfect for anything else . Under international rules she is ineligible for racing competition , and her records will not intrude on those of the propeller-driven classes . // Boat-to-boat races , however , are no concern of Don Campbell . As the week started , he was concerned only with waiting for the right weather to make his run for the record . " I can do it , " he said , " if I can hold the brute . "
