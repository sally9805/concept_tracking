Every seat in Mexico City 's ornate Bellas Artes palace was filled , and outside hundreds waited vainly to get in . On the stage , the country 's top entertainers trooped to the microphone to sing and play in a two-hour broadcast over Mexico 's 254 radio stations . All of the 50-odd songs they sang were the work of a gaunt , sad-eyed , scar-faced wisp of a man who watched from the wings . His name : Agustin Lara , who was celebrating the 25th anniversary of his career as Mexico 's and Latin America 's favorite composer . <P> Agustin Lara has been called Mexico 's Irving Berlin , though the parallel is more in output and popularity than in mood. * Inimitably latino , Lara is a composer of melancholy love songs who now single-mindedly says : " Woman is the reason for my existence . " Since , like Berlin , he can neither read nor write music , he pecks out his tunes on a piano and lets others set them down . In this fashion he has written some 600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> For Pesos , for Passion . Revolutionary adventure attracted Lara briefly ; at 16 , he left home to campaign with Pancho Villa . Back in the capital after a year of it , and hungry , he got a job playing the piano in a brothel , was soon steeped in the smoky atmosphere of the dives of the Barrio de San Miguel-Mexico 's Montmartre . The secrets the girls told him in idle hours he phrased in songs . One night , as he broke off playing his new song Rosa , a buxom beauty named Yoland pulled a knife from her garter , slashed his face from mouth to ear , then knelt at his feet shrieking for forgiveness . Soon after , Lara wrote Woman ( " You have in your look the passion that fascinates " ) , a smash hit that lifted him from the brothels to the best bistros of Mexico and South America . <P> He wrote music for revues at the Teatro Lirico , and in 1932 began croaking his own songs in an immensely popular radio program . Lara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Touring neighboring republics , he was mobbed by women in the streets . After quarreling with his actress-wife , Carmen Zozoya , Lara met Movie Star Mara Felix just before a party in honor of her first big picture . " Please come , Seor Lara , " cooed Mara . " But I warn you that we have no piano . Just a guitar . " Next day he sent her a snow-white piano and a card inscribed : " With all my respect to beauty , Agustin Lara . " They were married in 1946 . <P> For Tears , for Tributes . Their honeymoon in Acapulco inspired Mara Bonita ( " Remember those nights in Acapulco , Mara of my soul ? " ) . She called him " My Skinny " ( Lara says he weighs 120 Ibs. " with an overcoat on " ) . He rained minks , Cadillacs and diamonds on Mara . But the rising young star was hard to hold , and they were divorced in 1947 , leaving Lara heartbroken . He told friends : " I love Mara too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce her . " <P> The hollow-cheeked Lara still lives his legend , tapping out tunes , for arrangers to orchestrate , keeping up his floor show at the Capri nightclub and his Lrico revues . His soft piano-playing in a darkened room with a single soft light playing on his pinched face is still the most irresistible thing in Mexican entertainment . The royalties roll in , and he spends them expertly .
