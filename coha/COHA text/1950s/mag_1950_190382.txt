Why is there a shortage of nurses ? The California State Senate Committee , investigating the problem in Los Angeles , last week heard a disarmingly simple explanation : nurses make such good wives . <P> " Registered nurses are prime wife material , " reported Dr. Donald Cass gravely , " because the same emotional and psychological urges which lead them into the nursing profession make them excellent wives and mothers . Only about 20% of all graduate R.N.s follow their profession for any considerable length of time . They tend to be snapped up by sensible young men . A nurse learns to care for other people 's pains , instead of spilling out her own problems . She takes to family life like an old hen taking over a brood of chickens . It 's no wonder there 's a nurse shortage . "
