TAKE a dozen or so one-man auto repair shops , locate them side by side under one management , and you 've got something new in service stations . This , in effect , is what you 'll find at a big shop recently opened in New York City . Every man who works there is an all-around mechanic , well qualified to give Gus Wilson a run for his money . As Charles Schnurmacher. who likes to think of his new $750,000 Manhattan Pontiac shop as an " automobile clinic , " explains it : . " Our mechanics are like family doctors . They can do everything for a car that a car requires , and they deal directly with the customer . " Unlike most big shops , this one has no service salesmen or order takers . When you drive in , an inspector-mechanic meets you on the apron . The same man stays with your car until the job is finished . You must deal with only one other person ? the cashier . The shop is laid out so that work can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job on from person to person . The equipment is the same as that available to any other service station , but it is used in a way few other shops do . This is not by accident . Schnurmacher , with 25 years ' automobile experience , is also head of an older , conventional service station in New York City . There he long ago learned that every repair-seeking customer  | is always " in a helluva hurry . " Knowing that full cash registers sprout from pleased customers , Schnurmacher analyzed operations at his old shop . He concluded that overspecialization among mechanics and the constant need to shift cars about were voracious time-consuming elements . Then he set out to build his " dream " station . It took him a year to acquire a piece of property on New York 's Eleventh Avenue that , by fronting on three streets , fulfilled his specifications . This per- mitted each of his repair bays to open on the street . He called in George P. Saladino , an experienced service-station engineer , who spent six months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhered religiously to Schnurmacher 's ruling , " Do n't move the car . Bring the equipment to it . " When construction was completed Manhattan Pontiac had a steel and concrete building with tiers of windows , creamcolored , interior walls of tile , a shadowless fluorescent-lighting system , and nine repair bays , each complete with expandable twinpost hydraulic lifts , built-in floodlighting , and a unique ten-hose lubricating system . The building fronts on a 40-foot by 200-foot service apron . Counting the basement stockroom , the street floor and second floor ( each of which can accommodate 50 cars ) , and the paved roof , with storage space for 80 cars , the building totals 55,000 square feet . Mechs Are De Luxe , Too Manning this station and serving customers ranging from the ordinary guy to notables like radio 's Ted Husing and the Metropolitan Opera 's Ferruccio Tagliavini are a group of specially selected mechanics . Schnurmacher calls them " the highest paid in the business . " All of them have had at least 12 to 14 years of repair experience . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you adjust a rear-end pinion ? " is about the simplest question he will encounter . If he passes the exam he is then sent for a month to Schnurmacher 's earlier , conventional service station . The idea is not only to find out if he is a qualified workman , but also to learn if he has the personality to deal directly with customers . Whether or not these are the highest-paid mechanics in the auto-repair business ( some average $150 a week ) , they are certainly among the most contented . During a 15-minute morning break ? for which the company provides coffee and cake ? senior mech Harry Baker said , " Imagine a mechanic that 's never on his back , with everything he needs within arm 's reach , or else conveniently mounted on wheels ! This place is the last word . " Charles Jordan , the service station 's ruddyfaced manager , says , " Baker 's too enthusiastic . I 've been in this business 31 years  | and I know there 's never a last word . Someone always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to do some pretty tall dreaming . " Customers always ask the impossible , and we come about as close to achieving it as you can with present-day equipment . There are bigger service stations , with larger staffs , that ca n't put cars through the works as fast as we can . " It may not be the last word , but this shop has already caused enough excitement in the trade to have drawn to it , for study and admitted imitation , automobile people from as far distant points as India , Brazil , Lebanon , Colombia , and Turkey . Curiously enough , the visitors have been particularly impressed by the fact that even the required-by-law , sand-filled fire buckets are mobile . What they have n't been told is that for all the careful planning , no provision was originally made for fire-bucket hooks . This oversight was discovered only after the walls had been tiled . So Schnurmacher went down to New York 's wholesale garment district and got hold-of several of the caster-mounted racks on which dresses are hung and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-dozen fire buckets , and can be quickly trundled to the scene if a fire should blaze up .  |
