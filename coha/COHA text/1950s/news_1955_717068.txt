txt As conceived in Western quarters , United States Secretary of State John Foster Dulles would like to see the Big Four take up the following three questions , the Associated Press said : 1 . Reunification of Germany . 2 . Restrictions on political freedom in Soviet satellites . 3 . Control of thermonuclear weapons . Regarding Germany , Chancellor Konrad Adenauer said May 10 he would reject any Soviet proposal at a big-power conference that would make neutralization of West Germany the price for German unification . Dr. Adenauer 's statement was made in reply to a question about his attitude if the Soviets agreed to unification of Germany provided the nation agreed not to rearm . Soviet . Policy Sifted The consensus was undoubtedly that , although there are signs of a d  --  tente in Soviet foreign policy , this stems mainly from Western ratification of the London-Paris accords , which has built up the Atlantic Alliance 's strength and restored unanimity among its members on the key subject of German rearmament . As one minister put it , " Our policy has borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this time . " As for the chances of a Soviet attempt to offer Germany neutrality on about the same terms as Austria , the council concluded that there can ' be no comparison between the two cases , for Austrian neutrality does not change the balance of strength to the detri ment of the West as German neutrality would inevitably do . The tone of the council meeting emphasized extreme caution about the chances of success of a Big Four meeting . There were many references to the need for caution , for thorough exploration , and for " patience , " as Dutch Foreign Minister C. W. Beyen put it . As to the possible content of this Big Four meeting , such foreign ministers as France 's Antoine Piney and Belgium 's Paul-Henri Spaak stressed that the West must not bargain on some issues . Guided by the military view , they argued , there could be no question of West Germany 's leaving NATO . Other Talks Pressed It is believed that until such time as the development of guided missiles does away with the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany , there can be absolutely no idea of evacuation . This leaves the West with relatively little to offer in a Big Four meeting on Germany . On the other hand , none of the ministers apparently is ready to believe in Soviet readiness to evacuate East Germany or the satellites . This is the background to Chancellor Konrad Adenauer 's solemn warning to the press against indulging in illusions . The conclusion of the day 's discussions on Soviet foreign policy appears to have been that tactics may change in the Kremlin , but the final objectives do not , so that it behooves the West to be extremely wary . The next topics of discussion by the NATO foreign ministers concern disarmament , the Middle East , and the Far East , including the Turkish-Iraqi treaty , Indochina , Formosa , and the Bandung Conference , where Turkey was the only NATO member present . This represents a shift in American policy or attitude toward a summit meeting  --  but not so great a shift as might appear . But Sir Anthony Eden , British Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulgarian , Soviet Premier , and President Eisenhower may well find themselves around the same table . It is no secret that In Paris Secretary Dulles ran into a diplomatic steam-roller working to pave the way for a summit meeting . The French argued they had won approval of the Paris pacts only by promising their people that a summit meeting would follow . The British made it clear that promise of a summit meeting was almost imperative for a Conservative Party victory at the polls May 26 . Mr. Dulles had gone to Paris determined to hold out against such a promise , but quickly shifted when he saw the formidable forces arrayed against him . Not only were Washington 's NATO allies crying for a summit meeting , but the popular European groundswell for a summit meeting apparently bowled him over . He quickly advised President Eisenhower that a summit meeting was practically inescapable ; whereupon the President gave him " full power " to arrange such a meeting if he thought it would be " feasible and useful . " Anglo-U.S . Views Differ It is no secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign ministers meeting precede a chiefs of state conference , doing the spadework for the chiefs and leaving them only final agreements to approve . But President Eisenhower has said all along that he was prepared to go anywhere and talk with anybody if it would advance the cause of peace . The two qualifications that he has generally tied to such assertions now have been fulfilled , more or less . Moscow has given a sign of being willing to work with the West ? in the Austrian treaty agreement . The Paris pacts , working West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , have been put into effect and West Germany now is a full-fledged military ally of the West . However , what is in prospect is not a summit meeting such as the world has associated with that term from war days . In fact , the way the current discussion of such a meeting is going , it looks , as if both London and Washington may get their somewhat contradictory wishes on this question . Compromise Sighted Britain for a long time has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the chiefs of state making basic global decisions ? as at Yalta , Potsdam , and Cairo . Washington , in contrast , has wanted a well-prepared pre-meeting by the foreign ministers . There an agreed agenda could be ? yorked out , with the ministers doing the spadework . What they seem to have come up with is a compromise that keeps the form of the British hope but the substance of the American plan . A summit meeting would he brief and general  --  only two , or three days , possibly . Mr. Eisenhower , Sir Anthony , M. Faure , and Marshal Bulganin would meet and discuss broad principles and policies . It would be preceded by foreign ministers talks ? either around a table or via diplomatic channels  --  setting the form and framework for talks . It would he followed by a much more extensive and exhaustive meeting of the foreign ministers as they worked to spell out the details of whatever broad agreements the chiefs of state might have reached .
