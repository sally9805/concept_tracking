txt State Secretary Dulles said tonight the forthcoming Geneva conference on Korea and IndoChina in no way implies recognition of Red China but instead will bring it " to account before the bar of world opinion . " Reporting to the nation by radio and television on the results of the recent four week conference in Berlin of the foreign ministers of the United States , Russia , France , and Britain , Dulles said : " Some profess to ' fear that the holding of this conference will imply U .. S. recognition of communist China . That fear is without basis . . . . The communist regime will not come to Geneva to be honored by us but rather to account before the bar of world opinion . " Molotov Accepts Terms Dulles said that just 60 minutes before the , four nation ' conference ended , Russian Foreign Minister Molotov agreed to accept the terms of the United States that there would be no recognition of Red China as a result of the Geneva conference . " I had told Mr. Molotov flatly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it was expressly agreed and put into writing that no United States recognition would be involved , " Dulles said . Mr. Molotov resisted that provision to the last . Iii sought by every artifice and device , directly and thru our allies , to tempt us to meet with columnnist China as One of the five great powers . Others Back ! J. S. Stand " We refused and our British and French allies stood with us . When we went into the final session last Thursday afternoon , I did not know what Mr. Molotov 's final position would be . So far , he had not accepted my position . We were to adjourn at 7 o'clock . At 6 o'clock ? just 60 ' minutes before the final adjournment ? Mr. Molotov ' announced that he would accept our nonrecogni ? tion proviso . " Dulles said the text of the resolution Molotov signed is as follows : . " It is understood that neither the invitation to , nor the holding of , the above mentioned conference shall be deemed to imply diplomatic recognition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will Deai with China Dulles said the United States well knows that a communist regime does exist in China " because its aggressive armies joined with the North *Korean aggressors to kill and wound 150,000 Americans . " " We do not refuse to deal : with it where occasion re= quires , " Dulles said . " It is , however , one thing to recognize evil as a fact . It is another thing to take evil to one 's breast and call it good . " That explains our nonrecognition of the communist regime , and also our opposition to its admission to the United Nations . " Blocked for 6 Months He said the United States went to Berlin wanting a Korean peace conference . He said the Communists had " blocked agreement " for more than six months on the time , place and composition of the conference . He said the agreement of the Russians to accept our terms that  --  the conference be held in /Geneva starting April 26 , with the United States , Russia , coinmunist China , the republic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations countries which sent troops to Korea as participants was just what the United States had sought . " I recognize , of course , " Dulles said , " that the soviet union would not have accepted , 100 per cent , our terms for the Korean political conference , unless it expected to benefit thereby . But so do we . " I can think of some soviet benefits that we would not like and should prevent . But I do not wholly exclude the idea that the soviet union might in fact want peace in Asia . We can hope so and we shall see . In the meantime , we shall keep on our guard . " Dulles said that since returning from Berlin he found " there is some confusion as to what really happened . " He called this " not surprising " inasmuch the conference debated a wide variety of matters over a period of four weeks . He predicted it probably would be " many months " before the full results could be " clearly seen . " Tells Two Results " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results which will profoundly influence the future , " Dulles reported . " First , as far as Europe was concerned , we brought Mr. Molotov to show Russia 's hand . It was seen as a hand that held fast to everything it had , inadding East Germany and east Austria , and it also sought to grab some more . , " Secondly , as far as Korea and Indo-China were concerned , we brought Mr. Molotoat to accept a resolution which spelled out the United States position that Red Chita ' might inAhese two instances ' as dealt with , but not as a goverarunt recognized by us . " For those who quest io n whether the four nation conference was worthwhile , Dulles said his answer is " yes " because it " cleared the way for other things to happen . " He said the unification and strengthening of west Europe may now go on and in Asia there could be unification of Korea and an end to the war in Indo-China " if Red China wants it . " : Calls It Possible Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dulles said . " What I do say is that they could not have happened had it not been for Berlin . " Dulles said that in the five years which elapsed since the western foreign ministers had met with the Russians , there had been the Korean and IndoChinese wars , Stalin had died and his successors " talked more softly , " communist China had " emerged as an aggressive military organization , " strains develop in Russian agriculture and industry , and the riots occurred in East Berlin . What did all of this add up to , , in terms of world politics ? " Dulles asked . " The uncertainty was leading to hesitation , wishful thinking , and some paralysis of action . There was only one way to find out . That was to meet with the Russians and deal with them in terms of said it amounted to this : He said that even tho he did not achieve his primary goals of obtaining Russian agreement for the unification of Germany and the liberation of Austria , the conference enabled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " out of Mr. Molotov 's own mouth . " He said it amount to this : Russia is determined to hold on to East Germany . It will permit unification of Germany only if the Communists can control the elections . It intends to maintain troops indefinitely in Austria . It offered Europe its " good will " if Europe would allow the soviets full control of Europd , the United States to be side lined to the role of " observer . " " The soviet position admitted of no real negotiation , " Dulles said . But he said he came away convinced the soviet leaders " genuinely fear freedom . " " They do not feel safe unless freedom is extinguished , or is defenseless , " he said , " that soviet attitude made it impossible to achieve any agreement at Berlin in relation to European matters . " Unity Among Three Nations Dulles said the conference did , succeed , however , in bringing " a greater degree of unity " among the United States , Britain , and France " than had existed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . came from the fact that the three foreign ministers stood for government and nations which were dedicated to the concepts of human liberty and national integrity which Mr. Molotov attacked . " Dulles said it was a tragedy that Germany and Berlin , and east and west Austria must remain divided . He said it was both " startling and shocking " to observe the contrast between the peoples of East Berlin and the western zone . Talks on Atom Plan Dulles said that he had " two private talks " with Molotov " about advancing President Eisenhower 's atomic energy plan . " He said the next step will be communications on the subject between Moscow and Washington thru the soviet embassy in Washington . Dulles reviewed the outcome of the conference at a White House luncheon with President Eisenhower , and also discussed it with members a the senate foreign relations committee . Sen. Humphrey D. , Minn. said Dulles indicated this country " had no plan of operation " if the French should withdraw their forces from Indo-China . Dulles said that the problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva conference .
