Nobel Prizewinner Francois Mauriac , the Roman Catholic novelist , who is much preoccupied with sin , delivered himself last week of a pessimistic commentary on French politics . " We must conclude , " he wrote on the front page of Le Figaro , " that the French people are able to secrete only a certain species of parliamentarianism , and that their bad habits are closely linked with their character . The saying that character is destiny applies to peoples as well as to individuals . <P> " It is no use reproaching man for being what he is and what he has always been . ... No , there is nothing to get indignant about against anybody ; neither against businessmen for whom profit is the big thing , nor against politicians who also have a business which they must lead to success . . . their re-election . . . Institutions do not change because men do not change . The day after the greatest catastrophe in our history the fall of France , we had lost sight of this truth ; the clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anew . I who have never placed hope in politics trembled with hope in that moment . And here we are in the same ruts we were in 13 years ago ; the coach rattles more , the horses are thinner and the flies are fiercer-that 's the only difference . " <P> Since they disagree on almost everything else , many Frenchmen disagreed with M. Mauriac 's dour outlook . What was more striking in France last week , however , was that more &; more Frenchmen were beginning to agree on one of the major causes of their chronic parliamentary crises . The cause : the constitution of the Fourth Republic , which came into force in 1946 and since has spawned 15 consecutive governments ranging in health from sickly to stillborn . So long as the constitution remains unchanged , Frenchmen are beginning to realize , premiers and cabinets are bound to come &; go with distressing frequency . <P> The constitution 's basic fault is that the National Assembly-comprising 627 deputies from a dozen parties-is entrusted with complete powers for governing France , but with almost none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Assembly votes against him is to quit . He has no veto power to ward off bad parliamentary acts . When a majority defeats him on a vote of confidence , he does not in practice have the powers to dissolve the Assembly , thus forcing the members to risk their own seats at an election . If he did have , the National Assembly might not be in such fickle haste to seat and unseat premiers.
