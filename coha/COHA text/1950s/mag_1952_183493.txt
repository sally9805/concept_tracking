Time was when Joe Louis let his eloquent fists do his talking for him . But last week the ex-heavyweight champion found himself shadow-boxing with an elusive opponent : racial discrimination , disguised in doubletalk . Joe fumbled for the right words , then angrily called it " the biggest fight of my life . " Specifically , Joe was squaring off against the Professional Golfers ' Association , which allows only " Caucasians " to enter a P.G.A.-sponsored tournament . <P> <P> It all started when Joe was approached by local officials about playing in the San Diego Open . Amateur Golfer Louis ( middle 70s ) decided to play . A Los Angeles Negro professional named Bill Spiller then applied to play in the tournament . Spiller qualified for the tournament with his golf ( 152 for two rounds ) , but not with his color . The P.G.A . disqualified him on a fancy technicality : he had not signed a " player agreement , " a document that the P.G.A . proffers only to Caucasians . <P> Joe had not signed any agreement either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invited amateur guest . He was also a good item for the pressagent , despite his color . He played an amicable first round with P.G.A . President Horton Smith , who shot a 73 . A two-handicap player , Joe shot a 76 , but failed to qualify for the final two rounds when he soared to an 82 next day . <P> But Fighter Louis had won the first round of his " biggest fight " by being the first Negro ever to play in a P.G.A . co-sponsored tournament . Joe 's ultimate strategy : to knock out the P.G.A . ban entirely , open the tournament doors to other qualified Negro golfers . This week Joe seemed to be winning his fight . The P.G.A . tournament committee voted to approve Negro participation in P.G.A . tournaments . There was still one minor hitch : Negro golfers will have to wait , as all non-touring P.G.A . pros do , for entry acceptance from the local sponsor . This week 's local sponsor , the Phoenix ( Ariz . ) Chamber of Commerce , announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be accepted in good faith . " Six Negroes will play in the qualifying round . <P> <P> Meanwhile , most of the other pros were going about their business of playing golf . The winner : Newcomer Ted Kroll , 32 , of New Hartford , N.Y , , with a 12-under-par 276.
