txt President Eisenhower scored a ? personal triumph in his invasion of the doubtful key state of Pennsylvania , and this , more than the actual words he uttered , impressed accompanying observers . Crowds were big , enthusiasm was high , and the Chief Executive hit with vigor and aggressiveness , which is just what GOP le'a'aers ' haVeTheen l'inpl'Oting. ' - Nobody can forecast with certainty which way the Keystone State 's 32 electoral votes will go , but it is agreed that Republican incumbent Senator , James H. Duff , is seriously challenged by former Mayor Joseph S. Clark , Jr. , of . Philadelphia . Though General Eisenhower carried the traditionally Republican state by 52 per cent in 1952 , Democrats captured the governorship ; and since then every big city has gone Democratic . Furthermore , the state GOP is sharply divided . Into this Republican trouble spot , the President projected himself on the heels of former President Truman , who left Pittsburgh just as the Eisenhower party arrived . City papers carried headlines that Mr. Truman had just called the Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1952 . This was the atmosphere into which the President dropped . Dreaming ' Rapped Mr. Eisenhower gave the party everything he had . From the minute he came down the ramp of the burnished presidential plane " Columbine " to the time he left , he was bolstering party defenses . Furthermore , he made a fighting attack in the big Hunt Armory before 10,000 yelling supporters in a speech nationally televised : High lights of this address were the declarations that Republicans could actually keep peace while Democrats would only dream about it , and that Adlai E. Stevenson is playing politics with " cheap and easy " Ipanaceas for ' ending the H-bomb race and . eliminating the draft. - The President 's - manner toward opponents , reporters observed , seems to . grow ' more scornful . as the campaign continues , and he is throwing himself more ? completely into the fray with each speech . He used such phrases toward his opposition as " clattering campaign oratory , " " political frresponsibility at its worst , " and " trying to pass on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " . At one point he indignantly interjected : " I wonder what kind of children they think Americans are ! " And he added : " And I also wonder what kind of man they think I am ! " Through it all , the Chief Executive appeared to be . enjoying ' himself immensely and to be personally in fine fettle . ' He went through downtown Pittsburgh at the rush hour with crowds lining the streets two and three deep . He was standing up in his Plexiglas " bubble top " Cur from which the center roof section is removed , waving to responsive crowds . At the big ; gaunt armory , whose structural steel beams look like the underside of a bridge , the President waved and grinned during two minutes of crashing applause . He was introduced by Senator Duff , who used the refreshingly direct approabh of , an earlier . political day in saying of Democratic Gov . George M. Leader : " He 's a jackass , and that 's what he is ! " As for the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the draft and the H-bomb tests , and commented , - with - soleirinity : " I , as your President and commander in chief of the armed forces , can not and will not make proposals contrary to national interest  --  nor offer you attractive prospects unjustified by world realities . No Cheap Peace ' " 1 will not premise that win- .. ning a peace based on justice will be cheap and easy . " The issue , of our ? military draft is no Matter of a technical point to be scored in a political debate . It is the , matter of the safety of our nation . " Mr. Eisenhower did not. : bate  --  the question of resuming negotiations with the Soviet Union . on : a moratorium on H-bomb .. testing , which Mr. Stevenson has urged . The President has previously taken the position that it is impossible to discuss this with Moscow until the latter agrees to mutual aerial inspection . Mr. Eisenhower repeated his previous charge that Democratic ? not Republican  --  votes defeated the school bill in the last Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a TV attack , charging that President Eisenhower is attempting to take credit for New Deal and Fair Deal social reforms . The President ' , speaking in turn in Pittsburgh , gave an indirect answer to this by taking up half a dozen specific issues . Among these , he declared in ' particular that the Republicans are the party of the " sound dollar " and of decentralized federal authority . GOP Theme Stressed On the whole , however , the Eisenhower speech did not so much raise new points or new intellectual positions as it developed =a political  --  posture =fOrthe Republicans , Mr. Eisenhower developed an aggressive , vigorous defense and counterattack in which his own personality was displayed to the fullest . The President 's speech stressed the GOP theme of " peace , prosperity , and progress . " It was scornful of Mr. Stevenson 's attacks , and implied that they were hardly worth notice . He reminded his audience of his role in ' bringing ' a truce in Korea , and by implication contrasted his own prestige in world affairs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is in " constant correspondence with leaders of . the other free nations , many of ? them my personal friends .
