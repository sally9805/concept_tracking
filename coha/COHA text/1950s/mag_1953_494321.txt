OCTOBER 26 , 1933 BONAFIDE prairie fires resulting from the nationwide drouth and political prairie fires resulting from Eisenhower , Benson and McKay policies are running a neck-and-neck race for pre-eminence in rural America . Both kinds are breaking out everywhere , despite the General 's personal effort to subdue the political variety at Kansas City October 15 . The political prairie fires result from three things : 1 . Agriculture Secretary Benson 's advocacy of low , " disaster only " price supports . 2 . Benson 's steadfast refusal to initiate direct cattle price supports . 3 . Interior Secretary McKay 's new electric power policy , threatening the wholesale power supply of several hundred REA co-operatives as well as that of great regions like the Pacific Northwest . The power policy fire , kindled when McKay withdrew Interior Department opposition to Idaho Power Co. taking over the giant Hells Canyon Dam site , now engulfs the Southwest , the Southeast and the whole Missouri River basin . Southwestern REA generating and transmission contracts are now being abrogated by Interior at Congress ' direction . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia Power Co. is pending , and REAs are fighting it . Now the Missouri Basin REAs are up in arms because Secretary McKay proposes to sell , irrevocably for 20 years , all available federal power in the Missouri Basin . Previously New Deal secretaries had made only short-term contracts for power with private utilities , so Interior could supply the increasing needs of preference customers , whose power needs are doubling every three to five years . Under McKay 's policy , the REAs must immediately buy and start paying for power for both present and future needs ? or be without sufficient povv , ; : r for their customers as demand increases . Fearing ruin , Missouri Basin REA co-operatives have called a special , emergency session in Omaha October 22 to demand rescission of the new power policy , abandonment of the proposed 20-year contracts with private utilities , and a return to the New Deal policy of serving preference customer needs . The group represents over a million rural power users . The cattle conflagration will reach Washington when Farmers Union 's Jim Patton leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle price supports from Secretary Benson and President Eisenhower himself . They expect to stay in Washington until officials see them . Old-line cattle organizations , opposing direct cattle price supports and allegedly dominated by packers , have been confronted with new , rival organizations all over the West . The new , widely publicized Texas-Oklahoma cattle organization with headquarters at Dalhart , Texas , set up earlier this year , ? has now been copied in at least five additional states . When the touring House Agriculture Committee held a hearing in South Dakota recently , a new South Dakota Livestock Council appeared in favor of cattle price supports , challenging the position of the old South Dakota Stock Growers Association and its right to speak for a majority of cattlemen , Other state groups are prepared to do likewise . Evidence of the spread of the political prairie fires is found in farm organization experiences . In Oklahoma , cow-country members are abandoning Farm Bureau and joining Farmers Union . The president of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau has resigned . Oklahoma Farmers Union expects to end the year with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union has been gaining membership steadily at about 10 percent a year recently . This year several states , like Oklahoma , will jump 25 percent to 50 percent , including Colorado , Wyoming , Montana , the Dakotas and Minnesota . The Union ' , : membership is increasing everywhere but Nebraska , where the state Farmers Union organization is so ultra-conservative its state president won a membership on Ike 's National Farm Advisory Committee . Farmers Union also has gained a strong membership toe-hold in Illinois , Indiana , Ohio and Virginia ? previously impenetrable Farm Bureau strongholds . The Farm Bureau , in contrast , has open revolts . For example , a Montana county FB recently called for cattle price supports contrary to the national position . A Minnesota county FB sent its president to the House Agriculture Committee hearing in St. Paul to oppose the low price-support position of their state president . The prairie fire smoke is not yet so dense as in Farm Holiday Association days , when milk trucks were upset , courts were defied and the sheriff could n't get more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the fires of drouth and declining income ? plus the new electric power . issue ? are ablaze and spreading . NEW REPUBLIC Taft 's Replacement THOSE who know Thomas A. Burke , the 55-year old four-term Democratic Mayor of Cleveland named by Gov . Frank Lausche to succeed Robert A. Taft , expect him to be a steady but not a conspicuous liberal in the Senate . Organized labor has consistently supported Burke in each of his campaigns . But he has never been called a " rubber stamp . " In the Christmas , 1949 , transit strike , he sought a back-to-work injunction and enlisted the support of some AFL leaders who thought the tiansit workers had been hasty . When Democrats were searching for a candidate to oppose Senator Taft in 1950 , Burke was one of the men acceptable to organized labor . But because of division among the Democrats , Burke decided not to run at that time . Labor leaders are relieved . For years they have been at odds with the temperamental Lausche who refused to cam- , paign against Senator Taft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have been considered much of an improvement over Taft . Burke , while a good friend of Lausche , can be expected to . support most Democratic attempts to revise the Taft-Hartley Act . During Burke 's administration , Cleveland became one of the few cities to enact a fair employment practices law . The new Senator did not originate the proposal to guarantee Negroes equal opportunity for employment , and this is typical , but he did support the move , taking strong measures to line up way ering Democrats in the City Council behind it . Burke 's appointment stopped speculation that Governor Lausche would try for the Senate himself in 1954 . It now seems more likely that he will run for an unprecedented fifth term as Governor . This would make him a more serious contender for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1956 than if he were merely serving as a freshman Senator . Ohio Democrats feel they now have a good chance of holding Burke 's Senate seat in 1954 . While his vote-getting ability has never been tested outside of Cleveland , Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of independents , some Republicans , and Ohio 's most influential newspaper , the Scripps-Howard Cleveland Press . A Lausche-Burke " good government " slate next year could draw support from many voters who are not rank-and-file Democrats . $3 Billion Bonus THE Federal Power Commission wants to change the required accounting system for electric and natural gas utilities . The changes , if approved by the commission in a case now pending before it , would weaken the companies ' long-term control over more than $2 billion in deferred taxes and might even bring reduced rates to hundreds of thousands of gas and electric customers . One question in dispute before the FPC is whether the utility companies have received benefits not intended by Congress in the rapid tax write-off program , created to spur defense industry expansion in the Korean War emergency . To encourage private companies to build more and bigger plants , the Congress authorized writing off depreciation of the construction cases in five years instead of the much longer actual life of the new facilities . FPC 's staff wondered if such generous tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilities . These utilities have a virtually assured " reasonable rate of income " at six percent or thereabouts . And rarely are they threatened with over-expanded facilities or lessening demand in the post-emergency period ? if it ever comes . The FPC staff asked , in sum : are utilities entitled to risk rewards when they take no Tisk ? A day-long relay of lawyers for big utility companies pleaded against any such re-examination of tax deferments . They offered two main arguments . One was that Congress clearly intended the benefits to assure company owners against risk ; that to take away any part of the deferment would be to frustrate the will of Congress and to do injustice to company investors . From the same side , and often from the same mouths , came a strange companion argument . This was that the companies really had received no tax savings whatsoever , since after five years of grace they would have to start the process of tax paying and eventually send in the identical amount . Counsel for the National Rural ElecOCTOBER 26 , 1953 tric Cooperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He noted that there has been ? no hazard , for utility companies , which are still having trouble in meeting mounted demand for electricity and gas . He described the tax deferments as " interest free loans " from the government . And he stressed that utilities can always seek higher rates ? if need ' be ? to be sure of a reasonable return on investment . Moreover , this assured rate of return on funds the companies can hold as deferred taxes would bring fully another $1 billion in benefits over the years for electric utilities alone , according to estimates by NRECA economists . With the nearly $2 billion that these utilities have had certified for rapid tax write-off , this additional $1 billion would give a total bonus of $3 billion over the 33-year average useful life of the expanded facilities . Since all of the nation 's federal power projects ? TVA and the rest ? have cost only an estimated $2.7 billion , it is readily apparent that private power companies may yet win out in the competition for government aid . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism of the private utilities stand against passing on any deferred tax benefits to consumers came from the staff counsel for the FPC , Francis J. Walsh . " In effect , " Mr. Walsh said , " the utilities are asking rate-payers to prepay taxes not to the government but to the utilities themselves for a period of 30 to 100 years . " And , Walsh observed to poker-faced FPC members and frowning utilities ' attorneys , there is a vast difference between taxes paid to the government " and paying amounts is the guise of taxes to a utility , which the utility will not pay to the government for a great many years to come and which will go to enrich stockholders unjustly . " McCarthy and the News FOR A WEEK McCarthy has come from closed hearings on the alleged radar " leak " at Fort Monmouth , N. J. , feeding out black headlines from his unsupported version of what happened ; it 's as pretty a set-up as Joe has ever had , and someday maybe we 'll know if it 's true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
