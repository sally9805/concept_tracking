THE NIGHT OF TIME ( 338 pp. ) - Ren Flp-Miller-Bobbs-Merrill ( $3.75 ) . <P> Adam Ember is a common soldier in a nameless army . Hill 317 is a hopeless position in a strategy never understood . The landscape flickers back and forth between realism and surrealism . The road along which the regiment marches " was not a marching straight into autumn . . . Under our marching boots the grass withered and faded . " Through sucking mud and pathless rain , the soldiers march to Hill 317 . They fight , joke , brawl , complain and die on the hill , forgotten by headquarters . Brooding over them is the gaunt figure of the Gravedigger Captain in his draggling coat , explaining to Adam Ember that he took the job because he wanted to be on the side of victory . " You do n't imagine either we or the enemy are going to win a victory here , do you ? " explains the captain coldly . " Death alone wins the victories . " <P> The ordeals of the men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or all armies , on any man or all men . When food runs low , hunger destroys human feelings , levels rank , reduces commander and commanded to animals . By unspoken agreement , the commandant steps aside , and the mess sergeant ( " The Dipper " ) takes over , inexorably dividing the remaining slices of bread . Each day the survivors eagerly await Adam Ember 's count of the newly fallen , for each death of a buddy means more bread for the living . When the men plead for provisions , the squawking field telephone informs them that " there is no Hill 317 " - in headquarters files , that is . Adam Ember , half delirious with hunger , has a vision of a huge headquarters filled with urgent requests from desperate commanders , from the Assyrian and Punic wars through the Napoleonic and on to the wars of the future . " Here they all lay . pigeonholed and neglected , covered by the same fine , unearthly dust of eternity . " <P> The Night of Time has an old-fashioned pacifist outrage about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to conclude that there are worse things than war . Ren Flp-Miller , 64 , was born in a corner of Europe long and bloodily disputed between Hungary and Rumania , saw war when he fought with the Austrian army in World War I ( he is now a U.S. citizen ) . Gifted and versatile ( Rasputin , the Holy Devil , The Power and Secret of the Jesuits , Triumph Over Pain ) , he has now written a strange , heavily symbolic , sometimes embarrassingly earnest novel . The Night of Time is a kind of Kafkaesque parable . But Adam and the men of Hill 317 have a saving humanity and individuality that Kafka 's sleepwalkers lack .
