Ted Williams , the $125,000-a-year outfielder of the Boston Red Sox , had a salary reduction notice last week . Ted was fishing in Florida when he got the news : the U.S. Marine Corps was calling him and a few hundred other aviators back to duty . On April 2 , two weeks before the baseball season opens , Ted will report for his physical . If he passes , he will start getting a captain 's base pay ( $356 a month ) and probably go to work at his old wartime job : teaching cadets how to fly . Airman Williams , an indiscreet talker when he gets his dander up , said the right thing this time : " If Uncle Sam wants me , I 'm ready . I 'm no different than the next fellow . " Just to show that it was impartial-and not out to sabotage the Red Sox pennant chances-the Marine Corps also called up the New York Yankees ' $17,000-a-year Second Baseman Jerry Coleman , a captain and wartime dive-bomber pilot ( 57 missions ) .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
