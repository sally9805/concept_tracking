B. &; K. <P> <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations on the fine and informative April 30 article on Khrushchev . It is a pity that the freedom-loving English invited a tyrant who , in his rise to power , executed millions of Ukrainians who resisted Communism . <P> <P> TARAS CHARACHALIS College Park , Md . <P> <P> Sir : <P> To those behind the Iron Curtain , B. &; K. 's visit here was a tremendous shock . <P> <P> A. K. KEDZIOR Colonel , former chief of Polish General Staff . London <P> Sir : <P> You overlooked one significant fact in the otherwise excellent analysis concerning the cold-shoulder treatment accorded to B. &; K. by the British-as contrasted to the effusive welcome extended Georgy . It is crystal-clear that Boom Boom Khrushchev vanquished Peep Peep Malenkov in the preliminaries for the fumbling championship of the U.S.S.R. Now , the tag team of Bim &; Bom is in training for the finals . Naturally , the British , being the jolly sporting type , are rooting for the underdog to make a comeback . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir : <P> Every now and then somebody from another part of the country wants to know why Texas cattlemen are in bad shape financially when they made so much money during the war boom . Your April 23 story should give them the answer . Those of us who are sticking this drought out are not looking for shoulders to cry on . Your article does help the rest of the country to know about conditions ; it might even help to buck up farmers and ranchers who have had good rains and good crops but are complaining about the plight of agriculture . Maybe some of Mr. Wilhelm 's philosophy , full of grit and fortitude , could by contrast make their lives seem a good deal brighter . <P> <P> W. A. SEIDEL Knippa , Texas <P> Sir : <P> I 've accepted the Big Dry with much the same resignation as I 've accepted everything else about Texas . Your article made me realize it was not a local exaggeration . I would like to add a footnote : a fellow from the office went fishing last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any luck . " Sure did , " he replied . " We found water . " <P> <P> A. A. AITCHES San Antonio <P> Politics v. Principles <P> Sir : <P> On the farm bill veto you say April 23 : Eisenhower " decided to let principle not politics be his guide . " Those who , after the President vetoed the gas control bill , said , " Now we know he is a candidate for reelection " have had their words flung back into their teeth . Dwight Eisenhower has again so refreshingly reminded us of the saying : Politicians look to the next election , statesmen to the next generation . <P> <P> M. C. McLAY Los Angeles <P> Sir : <P> <P> It is absolutely nauseating that the Democrats are so two-faced that they would play around with farm families ' welfare just to be able to " provide the only way to get a Democrat elected President in November . " <P> <P> RICHARD L. BRUBAKER Stillwater , Okla . <P> Art &; the Artichoke <P> Sir : <P> <P> On looking at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are ready to buy Obnoxious paintings that offend the eye , Like Picasso 's wanton practical joke , That 's known as the " Lady with Artichoke.
