The instrumentalists making their way to the stage of St. Louis ' Kiel Auditorium ranged in age from 13 to 60 . Some of them were housewives , others were students , disk jockeys , dentists , engineers . But when Guest Conductor Edouard van Remoortel rapped them to silence and led them into Beethoven 's Egmont Overture , housewife and teen-ager played with astonishing competence . At the start of its 100th season , the St. Louis Philharmonic demonstrated again what its admirers have long claimed-that it is the finest non-professional orchestra in the world . <P> Only one U.S. orchestra-the New York Philharmonic-is older than the St. Louis Philharmonic . Founded 20 years before the city 's professional orchestra , the St. Louis Symphony , the Philharmonic has attracted generation after generation of St. Louis families to its ranks , has sent alumni by the score into virtually every major U.S. orchestra . Its quality amazes visiting conductors , especially Europeans unaccustomed to amateur playing on such an ambitious scale . Last week 's concert included , in addition to the Beethoven selection , Mozart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poem for Violin and Orchestra , the overture to Rossini 's Barber of Seville . The orchestra negotiated all of them with every minim and crotchet in place , " and with a typical air of lyric enthusiasm . <P> The Philharmonic started business in 1860 with a program that included such contemporary crowd rousers as the overtures to Michele Carafa 's La Prison d'Edimbourg and Francois Boieldieu 's La Dame Blanche . Most of the time since , it has stuck to a rigid amateur policy ; only the conductors and guest soloists are pros . Part of the orchestra 's success stems from its organization ; its governing board is made up of playing members , and each of the orchestra 's 95 instrumentalists must survive an annual audition ; if any player does not measure up , he loses his place , must give way to fresh outside talent . Every orchestra member pays $10 to play with the Philharmonic ; the remainder of the $8,000 budget is made up from the sale of season tickets . <P> Whole families often play with the Philharmonic . S. Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plays the second flute while his wife is a timpanist and his 23-year-old son a French horn player . The rehearsal schedule is heavy : six 2-hour rehearsals for each of four concerts . What gives the Philharmonic its special quality ? " They are amateurs , " said Guest Conductor Van Remoortel last week , " in the old sense of the word-'people in love with something . ' This group happens to be in love with music .
