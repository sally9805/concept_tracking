For a few hours on July 20 , 1944 , Nazi Germany 's fate hung on a 32-year-old Wehrmacht major named Otto Ernst Remer . On that day , believing that their plot to kill Hitler had succeeded , * the mutineers occupied the War Ministry in Berlin and flashed the code word Walkure to all Wehrmacht units . On its receipt , commanders throughout Germany were to break open sealed orders directing them to arrest Nazi and SS officials and occupy their headquarters . Germany would at last throw off Naziism . <P> Much depended on the few hours before the anti-Hitler troops could get to Berlin . Nazi headquarters in Berlin had to be seized , and the Berlin Gauleiter , Propaganda Boss Goebbels , arrested . Orders to do this were given to the commander of the Guards Battalion , Major Remer . <P> Jawohl . Destiny perched on Remer 's shoulders . Instead of arresting Goebbels , he went to see him , unsure what to do . Goebbels persuasively cooed that Hitler was still alive , reached for the phone , handed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Adolf Hitler . " Jawohl , mein Fhrer , " quavered Remer-and his mind was made up . Hitler empowered Remer to act in his behalf to crush the plot and supersede all officers . By evening , the Nazis again gripped Berlin . <P> Remer 's hour of glory-which eventually won him a sensational advancement from major to major general-helped prolong the war ten months . In the blood bath of revenge that followed , 5,000 Germans were arrested , tortured and killed . <P> But Otto Ernst Remer felt no shame about his work . Two years ago he began going from town to town under the auspices of the neo-Nazi Socialist Reich Party , telling avid listeners the great saga of how he had served the Fhrer and confounded the traitors . He became a minor hero , and grew bolder and bolder until last May 3 , in Brunswick , he shouted : " These conspirators of July 20 are to a great extent traitors to their country ! " <P> This was too much . Last week , neat and spruce in a brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , accused of slandering the July 20 conspirators . <P> The Witnesses . Actually , the real defendant was not Remer but the conspirators . The issue involved the very foundations of the democratic West German Republic . Who were the real traitors , the Nazis or the plotters ? All Germany last week carefully followed the trial . <P> Intense , nervous Prosecutor Fritz Bauer , whose eye tic and lined face attested to years in Nazi concentration camps , summoned his witnesses . He called survivors of the plot ; he summoned theologians who said that Christians were justified in ridding their nation of tyrants . Another witness quoted Hitler himself in Mein Kampf : " If through exercise of governmental power , a nation is led toward ruin , rebellion is not only a right but a duty . " <P> Prosecutor Bauer , pressing yet another point , asked : Was the plot really a stab in the back ? Historian Percy Ernst Schramm , wartime keeper of the Supreme Command 's diary , testified : " The war was lost . Final catastrophe was certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Bauer , rapping the table , poured out his summation : " The resistance fighters wanted only to save their country . The Third Reich was an illegal state , and every citizen had the right of self-defense against it . Hitler was the greatest of war criminals . There can be no treason against a war criminal .
