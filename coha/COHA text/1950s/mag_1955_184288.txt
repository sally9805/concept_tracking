Dignified in formal tail coat , the President-elect of Uruguay 's National Council , Luis Batlle ( pronounced Bat-zhay ) Berres , 57 , stepped from his car one sunny afternoon last week and mounted the broad steps to the main entrance of the halls of Congress . There he came face to face with veteran conservative Leader Luis Alberto Herrera , 81 , who has valiantly run for President eight times and lost every time , most recently to Batlle Berres . It was a scene that could not have occurred in any of a dozen other Latin American countries , where the defeated candidate would have been exiled , sulking or plotting a revolution . In democratic Uruguay winner and loser greeted each other warmly , and a big crowd in the plaza shouted for them both . <P> Word of Honor . Because Uruguay 's government is constitutionally secular , the oath of office that Batlle Berres swore a few minutes later in Congress ' circular marble hall was taken on a copy of the constitution rather than a Bible , and on his personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , members of Uruguay 's Swiss-style council of state , did likewise . Five are from Batlle Berres ' Colorado Party ; three chosen members will take the presidency in succeeding one-year terms after their chief has served for the first year . The other councilors , among them Herrera , are from the opposition National Party . <P> Luisito , as Uruguayans call Batlle Berres , and his fellow councilors will face grave problems right away . The country 's wool is selling well , but its wheat must compete against other countries ' surpluses , and its famous herds of cattle have been depleted by drought . The country 's left-of-center , welfare-state laws provide subsidies for both wheat farmers and cattlemen , although the public debt is already $387 million-high for a country of only 2,500,000 people . Workers are feeling the pinch of inflation , with prices nearly 2 times greater than in 1943 . Strikes have been frequent . <P> Work for Progress . But since the hard-fought election ( TIME , Dec. 13 ) , Batlle Berres has closed ranks with other factions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate and a working majority ( the opposition is split seven ways ) in the Chamber of Deputies . And he is well aware that essentially his job is raising Uruguay 's production . In his inaugural address he said : " We shall work , and we shall make the country work . " He still hoped to " march down the roads of the left that in other lands make men shudder , but in ours merely constitute steps on the way to progress . " The speech brought hearty cheers . <P> The ceremony over , the councilors arranged themselves for a photograph . Herrera pressed Batlle Berres to the front with the courteous " Please go ahead . " Smilingly , the new President took the defeated candidate by the arm , sat by his side and said , " With your help , we shall go ahead . "
