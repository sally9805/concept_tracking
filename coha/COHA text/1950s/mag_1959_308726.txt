<P> In the almost eleven years of Israel 's existence as a nation , white-thatched Premier David Ben-Gurion has never hesitated to take tough decisions , in spite of the consequences , which are often economic . The hard-pressed Israelis are still paying special heavy assessments for their militarily brilliant Sinai invasion of Egypt . Now faced with the problem of absorbing 100,000 new immigrants ( mostly from Communist Rumania ) , the government last week slapped new taxes , up to 70% , on consumer goods , ranging from aspirin to refrigerators . It abolished rationing , price controls and subsidies on essential foodstuffs and proclaimed a " compulsory loan , " which would eat up as much as 12% of salaries after taxes . <P> Despite Ben-Gurion 's personal popularity , people were beginning to grumble , and last week they could be heard .

The strong right-wing Herut Party ganged up with minor leftist parties in Ben-Gurion 's own coalition to elect 75-year-old Nahum Nir , onetime head of the Polish Waiters ' Union ( who boasts that in 1906 in Warsaw he led the world 's first successful strike against tipping ) . <P> Confronted with this setback , Ben-Gurion 's ministers suddenly began to have second thoughts about raising taxes . And to bolster up his own apathetic party , the Premier called home articulate , erudite Abba Eban , 44 , Israel 's able , longtime Ambassador to the U.S. and the United Nations , invited him to get into politics . South Africa-born , Cambridge-educated Abba Eban will presumably be groomed to replace ailing Golda Meir ( formerly of Milwaukee ) as Foreign Minister . First he must get in touch with domestic problems , and learn to leaven his meticulous classical Hebrew with the kind of everyday Hebrew that contemporary Israelis understand . <P> Another attractive candidate being groomed by 72-year-old Ben-Gurion : one-eyed Major General Moshe Dayan , 43 , former army chief of staff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago to Hebrew University to catch up on his education after years of fighting ; he has since flunked several subjects , is still hard at work making up for the schooling gaps in a busy soldier 's life .
