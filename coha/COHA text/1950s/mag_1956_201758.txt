In making its 1956 awards in physics and chemistry , the Nobel Prize Committees of the Swedish Royal Academy of Science recognized the fact that few modern scientists work alone . They generally work in teams or as individuals closely linked together by exchanges of ideas and information . The physics prize last week went jointly to three Americans who invented transistors , those specks of educated germanium that do the work of much larger vacuum tubes and have already produced an electronic revolution . The prizemen , Dr. Walter Brattain , Dr. William Shockley and Dr. John Bardeen , did their work in close association at Bell Telephone Laboratories , Murray Hill , N.J. , and it would have been wrong to give the whole prize to any one of them . <P> The chemistry prize went to a team of a different type . The winners , Sir Cyril Norman Hinselwood of Oxford and Professor Nikolai N. Semenov of the U.S.S.R. 's Academy of Sciences , worked in laboratories more than 1,300 miles apart . But they worked on the same subject , chemical chain reactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were friends and correspondents for 25 years . Their discoveries , extremely important for an age that gets most of its energy from exploding gases , could not be disentangled.
