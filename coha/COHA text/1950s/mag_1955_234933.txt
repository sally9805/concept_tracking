Early every Wednesday morning , a Polish-born ex-peddler rides in a chauffeured limousine to the Pink House , headquarters of Argentina 's federal government . Smiling and confident , he takes his place among the high officials gathered for the weekly Cabinet meeting presided over by early-rising Strongman Juan Pern . The ex-peddler is Jos B. Gelbard , 38 , a well-to-do clothing wholesaler and president of the fast-growing General Economic Confederation ( C.G.E. ) , a government-sponsored association that speaks for Argentine business . <P> Prop &; Counterweight . Until a little more than a year ago , business had no effective voice in Pern 's councils of state . Pern came to power as the business-baiting leader of Argentina 's workers , and he made the General Labor Confederation ( C.G.T. ) the main prop of his regime . In labor-management disputes . Pern 's government and courts almost always sided with the C.G.T . <P> The creation of the C.G.E. in 1953 , as a counterweight to the 6,000,000-member C.G.T .. fitted in with Pern 's vague variety of Mussolinian corporate-state philosophy , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up a business federation he expected to 1 ) broaden and stabilize the base of his power , and 2 ) boost the nation 's industrial output . Said Pern , in a recent speech sounding remarkably different from the rabble-rousing Pern of yesteryear : " We may get some results if we try to persuade people to produce more by appealing to their national spirit and ethical principles . But we get better results if we include the stimulus of profit . . . To improve the standard of living , we must work harder to produce more . " <P> Strongman 's Eye . Pern reached far afield for C.G.E. Boss Gelbard , who had caught the strongman 's eye by organizing a local businessmen 's association ( pro-Pern ) in the city of Rosario in 1950 . Last week Gelbard moved into a glittering new office , decorated with an enormous portrait of Pern , in a C.G.E.-owned seven-story building near the stock exchange . Nearly every sizable business in the country belongs to the C.G.E. , and from each member-firm Gelbard extracts an initiation fee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the yearly payroll . Ultimately , Gelbard promises , the money will be spent on an elaborate program of social services , lectures , scholarships and research . <P> Gelbard has no governmental authority , but Cabinet ministers , big businessmen and labor leaders all listen to him respectfully . Together with Eduardo Vuletich , head of labor 's C.G.T. , he is organizing , nationwide " Congress of Production and Social Welfare , " scheduled for late March . Deputies of Gelbard and Vuletich have made scores of speeches at joint C.G.E.-C.G.T. meetings , preaching the new gospel of increased production through labor-management cooperation .
