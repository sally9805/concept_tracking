DIGGING THE WEANS A Story by ROBERT NATHAN Drawings by N. M. Bodecker T H E inscription on the north wall of the temple at Pound-Laundry on the east coast of the Great West Continent has finally been deciphered by the team led by Sr. B'Han Bollek . This work brings us certain assurance of the theory expressed by Bes Nef , Hanh Shui , and Nat Obelgerst-Levy that a people of considerable numbers and power formerly inhabited this salt and desolate land . It is a triumph for those archaeologists who have been working ever since the fortunate discovery of an ivory cross and string of beads at the northeast , or " Bosstin " tumulus , along with a rusted iron wheel which seems to have been designed to run along some kind of track or trolley . These artifacts , as everyone knows , are now in the museum at Kenya . What we have been unable to discover , is the fate of these ancient people . That they perished in some sort of upheaval many thousands of years ago is clear from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " nor for north ? rain nor hail nor snow .. . " there are some hieroglyphics missing , and the inscription ends with the phrase . . . " their appointed rounds . " However , it must be remembered that the r and the w are readily interchangeable , both in Hittite and in ancient Hivite , and Bes Nef prefers the reading : " their pointed wounds . " This naturally suggests a catastrophe , possibly an invasion from the east , a belief , I may add , greatly encouraged by the findings in the Valley of the Sun , which will be discussed later . On the other hand , if , as some believe , including B'Han Bollek , that the phrase should be read : " their appointed rounds , " the meaning of the full inscription might well be as follows : " The north rain , the hail and the snow also from the north have accomplished their appointed ' rounds ' or tasks " . . namely , have annihilated the in-habitants . So much , then , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient people . Professor Shui believes that they may have been Brythons , and related to the still older , Druidic culture whose stones are still to be seen in the East Island . Professor Shui bases this theory upon a certain similarity in t he two glyphs , the Brythonic " bathe " and the Wean " bath " ; but his theory necessarily comes to grief when one examines the glyph for " that which rises " ? the Brythonic " lift " and the Wean " elevator " having obviously no common root . I have called these people the Weans , because certain archaeological findings incline us to the belief that they called their land the We , or the Us ; actually , in the southern part of the continent , the word Weuns ( or Weans ) does appear , as well as the glyph for Wealls , and the word Theyuns . To return for a moment to the theory of catastrophe , and the " pointed wounds " of Bes Nef . In the Valley of the Sun there have been unearthed many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would seem to be a kind of huge praying mantis . There are many groups of such figures , usually including male and female , and sometimes with young ; it is curious that in every case the male figure is larger and more powerful than the female , which we know to be untrue in the case of the actual praying mantis . These figures nevertheless have the small , cruel head , the long savage arms , the spindly legs , and the attenuated bodies of the mantis . Is it possible that a civilization of men and women , more or less like ourselves , might have been overwhelmed by an invasion of mantis-like insects ? Where could they have come from ? and where did they go ? The conjecture is , of course , fascinating ; but no mantis skeletons or remains of any kind have been found , except the above-mentioned statues . Pound-Laundry is in itself the richest of the diggings . It is believed that at one time this city ( for recent excavations indicate " the laundry , " as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture ) may at one time have been , in fact , the capital of We , or at least to have had some political or historic importance . ObelgerstLevy translates the first word of the name as " washing " ; the second is obviously the sign for " weight . " It is not known what  --  if anything  --  was washed there . In the middle mound , or Cha'ago , near the Lakes , there have been unearthed several paintings ; badly discolored , they yet show enough to prove that the inhabitants of Cha'ago were not entirely without visual art . However , they show almost nothing else . They portray squares , lines , lozenges , and mathematical figures ; perhaps they were used in some way by the astrologers of the period . One finds no recognizable human face or figure . We can not be sure what the Weans of Cha'ago looked like . ( In this relation , it is interesting to note that among the artifacts unearthed at Cha'ago were some unbroken jars and other ceramic objects ; also statues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stone , iron , and bronze . One is allowed to wonder if there was not some correspondence between these art objects and the praying mantises who may have taken over the country . It is also believed that the Weans had music , but so far at least only a few brass instruments and some drums and cymbals have been found ; no sounds have come down to us from those faraway people except a high rasping cry from a slender horn-like object found in Oleens . ) T O R ET URN again to the matter of what the Weans may have looked like ; no human hones have been found . Although we have turned up many artifacts of the period , we have nothing for the anthropologists to work Praying mantises with young on . It is probable that the bones of these people were brittle , and turned to chalk soon after interment . The greatest difficulty in reconstructing the life of the Weans has not been the deciphering of the inscriptions and the scrolls  --  due to the brilliant work of Professors Bollek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true ancients , used little gold , preferring to build everything of steel or other metal , and of some curious substance which Bes Nef translates as " gastric , " or " plastric . " As a result , little is left for the archaeologist . Stone was used mainly for monuments , as was bronze , but those which have been uncovered are too heavily encrusted with bird-droppings to be easily recognizable . One theory is that the Weans collected guano ; but it is not known what they did with it . It is here , for the first time , that I must take issue with my esteemed colleague , Professor Kowly of the Institute for Ancient Arts and Letters , who has discovered in one of the scrolls at Pound-Laundry a glyph of what he believes to be a bird-man . Professor Kowly sees in this some correspondence to the djinn of the even . more ancient civilizations of Akad and Sumer . While agreeing in the translation of the glyph , I must dispute its meaning : I believe it to have a purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing , it is often found along with the glyph of a woman , and the sign of a host , or hosts ; there seems to be another letter between the final t and the s , possibly an a or an e , which would make it hostas or hostes . I can not help but see this as a picture of an ordinary family , the man in winged splendor , as befits a husband , the woman merely one of a number , or host ( or hostes ) . In this relation , it is interesting to note that the Hittite plural , in the feminine gender , often adds the e . I am not one of those who hold that these unknown Weans were actually Hittites , although I admit to some strange correspondences . In any case , a Sumerian djinn would never bt. : ' mind accompanied by a woman , unless she were a sorceress . There is no suggestion that the woman-hostes was in fact a witch or sorceress , Professor Bollek at work which I believe effectively disposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tumuli of the Weans , each one of which appears to contain and cover the ruins of a city or congregation of habitations , an expedition under Hulay-Beneker has been for several seasons in the field in search of a mound thought to cover the most extensive congregation of all . The name of this lost city , or congregation , which is believed to have been more influential in Wean affairs than Pound-Laundry itself , was  --  as deciphered by both Erctcbbe and Bes Nef  --  Mil Town . So far no trace of it has been found . All that we have been able to learn of Wean manners and customs we have been obliged to decipher from the copper and silver tablets found in the mounds , and in the Valley of the Sun in the southwestern part of the country . As a matter of fact , it would appear that a considerable civilization flourished in the southwest , not in any way inferior to the middle mound at Cha'ago , or to the eastern tumuli such as n.yok . Here , in transcription , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from scrolls found in the Valley : " for that he did cause them . . . by rock and roll ... to give out cries and screams .. . loudly . and .. . in the corridors ' . .. el I , syncope- . The word " roll " or " rolls " suggests a feast , possibly a feast of communion on a grand scale . So far no one has been able to explain the presence of the word " rock . " However , it is apparent that the people came together , and were seized by an ecstasy of some sort in which they lost reason and decorum , This belief is further strengthened by another scroll found in the same tumulus , in which the scribe reports : " and the spirit came down . " So the evidence points to the fact that the Weans were a religious people . There is additional witness in a silver coin dug up in one of the smaller mounds , which carries the inscription " In God We Trust " ? or " Trusted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tense of the verb " to trust " is obscure . Neither Eretebbe nor any other member of the Academy has as yet been able to discover what god was meant . It is extremely unlikely that these ancient people had only one ; inscriptions found among the ruins of Pound-Laundry suggest , in fact , a number of religious differences among them . There arc definite traces of Hebrew culture in the ruins of n.yok ; and although nothing has so far been found at Pound-Laundry to suggest Babylonian or early Egyptian influences , there are hints here and there of the Cyprian cult of Antinous , particularly among the arts . It is probable , too , that the Weans worshiped , among others , a sort of horse-god or centaur . Professor Rass points out that the fragment un- " Columns " ? Bollek . " Aisles " ? Obelgerst-Levy . " " Syncopation " ? Obelgerst-Levy . But this snakes no sense , apparently . earthed at s.nita , and known as the Rass fragment , contains the unmistakable glyph for " horse , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yet another glyph , found not far from s.nita , is that of a bearded god ; it , too , states that " Schwepps schwaps ? was first . " In this regard , it is interesting to note that in a fragment unearthed at Oleens , and known as the Oleens fragment , the word " schnaps " is written : " cocacola , " which was the name of an Aztec root-deity . I N POLITICS , we are on surer ground . It is possible to say with absolute certainty , from scrolls unearthed at Pound-Laundry , and also from the ancient city of Boxton , or Bosstin , known to archaeologists as mound x-5 , that the Weans were divided into hegemonies or states , each ruled by a theocrat or autocrat , and all loosely joined in a confederacy under one ruler ( who , however , was not a theocrat ) whose duty it was to retire after an interval varying in length from four to twelve years , and to issue warnings and oracles . These groups , or states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn divided into wards . As for the system of government itself , it appears to have been conducted by means of barter , each county or state getting what it could for itself in exchange for helping its neighbor to do the same . Public servants , we know , were paid little ; they were expected to enrich themselves as best they could in private . When this enrichment , which was illegal , was discovered , they were beheaded . This curious fact did not keep the majority of Weans from seeking public office ; but one is forced to conclude , from inscriptions found at Nassaw , that the most admired citizens lived in actual poverty , and rarely spoke at all , except in musical sounds or mulae . As we have already sounds have come down to fortunate . It is true that oblong form , were jellies , but scrolls ) . Unfortunately , both scrolls , though easily legible , due to the brilliant work of the scholars Bes Nef and Obelgerst-Levy , are unintelligible ; that is to say , the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of these scrolls appears to be an account of a god or hero named Finigan , or Finnegan ; the size of the scroll and its rare state of preservation attest to its importance as a religious or historical document , but it is impossible to make out what happens to him . The second scroll is in what appears to be a metrical , or verse form ; nothing can be gathered from it at all . A tablet unearthed at n.yok gives us a welcome glimpse into business transactions in We . " Having borrowed a million , " it reads in the transcription of B'Han Bolick , 11 acquired thereby credit to twice that amount . " This suggests an economy not unlike our own : one thinks of the motto of our Treasury Department : " To the Borrower , All . " Throughout history there has never been anything more useful than credit , to establish credit . Without a debt , there is nothing . " Schwcpps , s ( hwapsi - runs first . " As for the history of these interesting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known than is known of the Romans , and later the Brythons : they established themselves in the Iand by killing off the native tribes already there , and built their empire by the sword ; when the sword rusted , they perished , along with Egypt , Babylon , and Greece , leaving behind them only these curious mounds , some scrolls , monuments , and glyphs , a few statues of eggs and mantises , and no music . ' Nat Obelgcrst-Levy denies that the Weans were ancestors of ours .
