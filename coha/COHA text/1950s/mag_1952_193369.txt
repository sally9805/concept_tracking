In an atmosphere hot with the steam of seething tempers , the riven ranks of British Labor met last week in a parliamentary committee room to patch up their difference-or open the rift irrevocably . For once , Party Leader Clement Attlee had thrown his native caution to the winds . He came to the meeting armed with a resolution demanding that the rebel Bevanites come to heel , without reservation . They must support , among other things , rearmament . Bevan himself , in a speech in his own constituency of Ebbw Vale , had all but threatened to withdraw from the party if such a resolution were pressed . <P> At the party meeting , Bevan taunted Attlee by saying , " Clem , you 're a liar . " Attlee sputtered back : " You are ! " At that warm moment , Tom O'Brien , leader of the studio and theater workers ' union , broke in : " May I propose that we transfer this meeting to Westminster Hall where we can have a brass plaque inserted in the floor to record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party committed suicide , aided and abetted by Clement Attlee and Aneurin Bevan ' ? " <P> His quip did the trick . The tension relaxed ; sanity and even some order were restored . A moment later , onetime Bevanite John Strachey claimed the floor to introduce a compromise resolution urging re-establishment of the old rule that Laborites must promise to vote with the party except on " matters of conscience , " e.g. , pacifism . Still quivering , Clem and Nye were both persuaded to accept the motion . Labor 's rift was thus papered over for the time being-but the crack was still there . <P> Five days later , in Durham , Nye Bevan aired a few of his current opinions : <P> U.S. policy is " doing more damage to Europe than Stalin could ever do . " <P> Socialists all over Europe should unite in a coalition against the policies of both the Soviet Union ( " poisoned by years of frustration " ) and the U.S. ( " dominated far too much by capitalism and financiers " ) . " I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe the American nation has the experience , sagacity or self-restraint necessary for world leadership at this time . " <P> The idea that Russia has any notion of making war on Western Europe constitutes " a monstrous misreading of history . "
