Clement Attlee in defeat still stuck to his promise to avoid " opposing for the sake of opposition . " But his boys would be boys . <P> Last week Britain 's Tory government asked the House of Commons to ratify the Japanese Peace Treaty , which Laborite Herbert Morrison signed at San Francisco . Attlee ordered the Labor Party to vote in favor . More than one-third did not . Though the treaty was approved ( by 382 votes to 33 ) , it was fought by the left-wing Bevanites ( who think it is an American idea and therefore bad ) and by Socialist M.P.s from textile and pottery constituencies , who fear a revival of Japanese competition . Another 80 Laborites abstained from voting . <P> Some of the Socialists behaved the same way with Churchill 's proposal to create a new Home Guard , plans for which had been studied while Socialist Manny Shinwell was Minister of Defense . Last week it was Manny Shinwell who led the fight on the bill . Apparently trying to outdo Nye Bevan as a Tory-baiter , Manny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the first all night sitting of the new Parliament . Those who stayed awake heard a great deal of cross and petty talk . When Shinwell announced that he needed a bath and a shave , a weary Tory brigadier asked him to get his throat cut , too . For talking back to the chair , Left-Winger Sydney Silverman , a tricky little hairsplitting parliamentarian , was suspended ( for five days ) by a vote of 194 to 147 . <P> As dawn trickled in through the clerestory windows of the House , dozens of M.P.s were asleep at their posts , but Manny Shinwell was still mounted on the ramparts , hurling mud . " Representatives of the so-called gentlemanly party , who have lambasted members on this side . . . are now squealing because they are getting some of it back , " he gloated . " It is impossible to insult some of them . If someone spat in their faces , they would think it was rain . " <P> " Disgusting , " cried a Tory . " I have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spitting at 10:20 a.m . " When I do , you will understand what Opposition is. "
