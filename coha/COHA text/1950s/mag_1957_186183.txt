TWICE during his long ( 86 years ) lifetime , Pioneer Impressionist Claude Monet had to face the jeers and catcalls of critics . The first time was when his painting , Impression : Sunrise , appeared at the first impressionist showing in Paris in 1874 , and was ridiculed as a formless monstrosity . But as the public slowly came to appreciate the impressionists ' atmospheric , sun-drenched works . Monet grew rich , won enthusiastic plaudits from the critics as well as the public . His second rebuff came toward the end . when his studies of the water-lily pond , with its Japanese covered bridge , on his country estate at Giverny were considered so amorphous that one critic called him the " victim and gravedigger of impressionism . " Now once again Monet 's star has begun to glow almost as brightly as that of Cezanne , whose studies paved the way for Cubists Picasso , Braque and Gris . And it is on Monet 's once-despised latest work that enthusiasm is now centered . <P> " Sistine Chapel . " French Painter Andre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monet 's Water Lily panels in Paris ' Orangerie " the Sistine Chapel of impressionism . " Collector Walter Chrysler Jr . and Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art both climbed aboard , bought late-Monet paintings ( TIME , Jan. 30 , 1956 ) . The Monet boom resounded even louder with a show of his late works last summer by Paris Art Dealer Katia Granoff , who bought from Monet 's son , Michel , the paintings that for decades had been stored at Monet 's Giverny studio ( where several collected shrapnel holes during World War II ) . The fresh supply set off a scramble that one U.S. buyer called " a regular gold rush ; the prices seemed to go up 1,000,000 francs a week . " By the end of 1956 Manhattan 's Knoedler Galleries had sold all but one of its 15 Monets , with top price reportedly as high as $55,000 . <P> Hailing the new trend , half a dozen U.S. museums this year are featuring their newly acquired Monet paintings . Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts has hung a show of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently purchased , nonimpres-sionist La Japonaise ( see overleaf ) , Monet 's genuine tribute to Japanese art , for which his first wife , Camille , posed . Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art is showing its third late-Monet purchase , Pond and Covered Bridge ( opposite ) . In April the Art Institute of Chicago will celebrate its newly purchased Iris at the Side of the Pond by surrounding it with the museum 's collection of 29 other Monets . Next fall the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and St. Louis ' City Art Museum will jointly sponsor the biggest Monet show of all : 75 to 100 Monets from the U.S. and abroad .
