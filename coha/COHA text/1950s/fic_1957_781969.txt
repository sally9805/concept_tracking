 | palm of her hand and yawned . " Oh , it 's you , " she said . " You woke me up . " " I thought you had singing lessons early in the morning , " Wang Ta said . " What time is it ? " Wang Ta consulted his watch . " Eight thirty . " " Only eight thirty ? " she cried . " It 's not dawn yet . " " Can I watch you take singing lessons this morning ? " " No , you ca n't , " she said . " My voice teacher says it 's bad to have visitors . I ca n't concentrate when I 'm being watched . But you can have breakfast here if you want to . Oh , it 's early . Only eight thirty , heavens ! " " I 'm sorry , " Wang Ta said apologetically . " Let me cook the breakfast for you . " " You can stay here for only an hour , " she said . " Come and help me make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom . It was luxuriously furnished , but by no means tidy . On the light-green dresser that matched the color of the whole room were brushes and combs and cosmetics of all types , lying in a state of litter as though a cat had chased a mouse among them . On the wall and on her other dresser and desk were a number of her glamour pictures taken on beaches and beside her car , each showing a great deal of her shapely legs . " Now , be a good boy and change the sheets , " she said , smiling . " I 'll be with you in a few moments . " She tossed two clean sheets on the bed and went out of the room , yawning . While he was changing the sheets in her wide , fragrant bed , Wang Ta noticed that on the lamp stand beside her bed was a plate of melon-seed shells and a Chinese book . He chuckled . The girl really knows how to enjoy life , reading in bed and cracking melon seeds . Curiously he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he read its title , Madam Fang 's Secret Romance . There were illustrations in the book , too . He almost blushed as he looked at some of them . He sat down on the bed and read a few paragraphs of the book , his heart pounding . " . . . after the long , ecstatic kiss , she felt her blood boiling in her veins and her  | bones melting with the burning desire of love . He pushed her down on the couch breathlessly and his masculine hands started to explore the curves of her soft , warm body ... " He devoured the paragraphs until he heard the water run in the bathroom and then a door click . He quickly put the book away and with his heart pounding more violently now , he started making her bed . When he finished he put his head out of the room and listened . The water in the bathroom had stopped running . He took the book , sat on her bed and read a few more pages . Suddenly the bathroom door clicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had my bath , " Miss Tung said , coming into her room . She pulled her robe sleeve up and put her arm to Wang Ta 's nose . " Does my skin smell good ? I washed myself with a special kind of soap . My brother sent it to me from Paris . " Wang Ta took her soft bare arm and smelled it . The fragrance was pleasant and mellow . He pressed his lips on the arm but she quickly pulled it away . " Now get out , " she said , smiling and fluttering her eyelids . " I 'm going to get dressed . You can go to the living room and watch television . Or read the movie magazines . I have all the movie magazines in the world . The ones from Hong Kong are bad . The movie stars printed in them are too skinny . Their chests are as flat as a washboard . No figure . " She loosened the belt of her robe and Wang Ta caught a glimpse of her fully developed breasts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let me get dressed . " Laughing and batting her eyelids , she pushed him out of the room with one hand , holding her robe loosely together in the other . kl " I 'll cook breakfast now , " Wang Ta said . " All right , " Miss Tung shouted from behind the door . " I want two soft-boiled eggs . My voice teacher said they are good for my voice . " As Wang Ta went to the kitchen he heard her scream , " Boil only three minutes ! " Wang Ta took some food out of her huge new refrigerator . He fried some bacon and made toast , then boiled her eggs , looking at his watch constantly to make sure it was three minutes . He was happy . She had a perfect figure . Too bad she had n't let him take a  | longer look at it . Well , it would be his sooner or later . He was sure that , after they were married , he would never be tired of looking at her or loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratification to anticipate the day when she would be his , all his alone . He set the little oblong table in the kitchen , boiled some water for tea and waited . When Miss Tung came in , she was dressed in a light-blue sweater and a white skirt , a pink silk scarf tied around her neck . " How do I look ? " she asked . Wang Ta looked at her and swallowed . She lifted her skirt a little and whirled around . " You like it ? " " Beautiful , " Wang Ta said . He could n't take his eyes away from her . " Let 's eat , " she said , sitting down at the table . " You must go in twenty minutes . " She ate her eggs quickly and gulped down her tea . " You seem to be in a great hurry , " Wang Ta said , eating very little and devouring her with his eyes . " Let 's go to the living room , " she said , rising from the table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay ten more minutes . " She came to the living room , threw herself on the daven port , put her legs up and her hands behind her head . " You can kiss me before I put on my lipstick , " she said , her body wriggling slightly . Encouraged , and his heart pounding , Wang Ta sat on the edge of the davenport , put his arms around her willowy waist and kissed her . The softness of her body and lips seemed to electrify him , giving him a tickling sensation that he had never experienced before . Miss Tung held his head tightly with both her hands and moved her head slightly up and down . They kissed as though they never wanted to stop . Miss Tung pushed his head away to take a breath , but soon their lips were together again . Wang Ta did n't know how long they had kissed ; he was willing to continue it for the rest of the day , but the doorbell suddenly rang . It buzzed until Miss Tung removed her lips from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll have to answer the door . "  | " Let it ring , " ' Wang Ta whispered . " No , " she said , " my car is outside . They know I 'm at home . They will get ideas . Everybody is as suspicious as a fox these days . Oh , bother ! " She pulled Wang Ta 's head down and kissed him back hungrily . The doorbell rang persistently . " Let 's drive out , " she said into his lips , " let 's go to Marin County . " " How about your singing lessons ? " Wang Ta asked . " Oh , my voice teacher wo n't mind . I 'll make it up some other time . " The doorbell was still ringing . " Guess I 'll have to answer the door now . Let 's drive out to the country . " She got up from the davenport , went to the hallway , pushed a button , and opened the door . Then she quickly returned to a chair and smoothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red face came into the apartment with a bunch of roses . " Oh , Mr. Poon , " Miss Tung said in Cantonese , rising from her chair , " you are early . I was in the bathtub . I did n't even have time to put lipstick on . Oh , meet my brother . " She jerked a hand at Wang Ta . " He just returned from Europe . This is Mr. Poon . " Mr. Poon eyed Wang Ta suspiciously . Wang Ta rose to greet him but Mr. Poon handed the roses to Miss Tung and said , " I came at ten . Let 's go . " " I 'm sorry , Mr. Poon , " Miss Tung said , " I ca n't go with you today . My mother is sick , I have to see her . Oh , what beautiful roses ! Oh , thank you , Jack . " " Why , do n't you want to buy that overcoat this morning ? " Mr. Poon asked , scowling . " Yes , but my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother ? " " Oh , you suspicious old turtle , " she said , pinching Mr. Poon 's short chin , " she is that Szechuan general 's wife , do n't you remember ? She adopted me . She is sick . " " Oh , yes , " Mr. Poon grunted . " Where is she ? " " In a hospital in Oakland . I must take my brother to see her . We 'll have to go now . Call me tomorrow , will you , Jack ? " She turned to Wang Ta and said , " Let 's go ! "  | On the street , Mr. Poon got into his shiny yellow Cadillac and slammed the door . Miss Tung pinched his chin through the window and said , " Please call me , will you , Jack ? Call me tomorrow . I 'll cook you a mushroom chicken dinner and tell you how my mother feels . All right ? " Mr. Poon grunted , " All right . " The Cadillac roared and darted away . " Come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ta as she went to her Buick parked on the other side of the street . " Your car might break down . " " Why did you say I was your brother ? " Wang Ta asked as he got into her car . " So he wo n't get ideas . He is already suspicious , ca n't you see ? " She started the car and drove down to Kearny Street . " Oh , it 's a beautiful day . Let 's drive to Carmel today , all right ? I 'll buy a few things and then we 'll go , all right ? " Wang Ta was a little disgusted . The middle-aged man and Miss Tung 's lies bothered him . Nevertheless he said , " All right . But I 'll have to go home and get some money . " " Oh , do n't bother , I can cash a check somewhere . I need some gas . The tank 's practically empty . " She swung her car and drove into a Shell station . " Have you got some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash with me . " Wang Ta dug out his wallet and checked . " I have two dollars . " " Oh , no , " Miss Tung said . " It takes seven dollars to fill my car up . I 'll cash a check here . " She turned to the attendant and asked in English , " Do you take a check ? " " A personal check ? " the attendant asked . " Yes . " " Sorry , miss , we do n't take personal checks . " " Oh bother , " Miss Tung said in Mandarin . " I 'll make a phone call . " She got out of the car and went to the station to make the call . Wang Ta got out to go to the restroom . But when he passed the office he heard Miss Tung say into the phone in Shanghai dialect ,  | " I 'll take you for a ride . Come over right away . Yes , the Shell station on Kearny . . . . All right . . . wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " Wang Ta scowled . He wondered what this was all about . When he returned to the car Miss Tung had already started it . " Let 's go pick up a man . He lives around the corner . " She drove around the corner and turned to Montgomery Street . Sure enough , a neatly dressed little man was waiting in front of a building , waving . She stopped the car and the man got in . " This is my brother , " she said in Shanghai dialect , then she turned to Wang Ta and added in Mandarin , " He is Mr. Liu . He ca n't speak Mandarin . " She turned the corner and drove back to the Shell station . " Fill it up , " she said to the attendant . While the attendant was filling up her car and wiping the win. , dows , Miss Tung gabbed away in Shanghai dialect , which Wang Ta understood a little . Mr. Liu laughed and was highly amused , when the attendant came to the window to announce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paid . " I 'll make a call , " Miss Tung said and got out of the car . Wang Ta and Mr. Liu sat in the car without saying much . All Wang Ta found out about Mr. Liu was that he was a merchant seaman waiting for his ship to sail . Presently Miss Tung returned . " I 'm terribly sorry , Tom , " she said to Mr. Liu . " I just called my mother . She is terribly sick . She wants me to go there right away ... " " I 'll go with you , " Mr. Liu said . " Oh , no . I do n't know whether we 'll be back tonight . She is terribly sick . Maybe we 'll have to send her to a hospital . Call me tomorrow , will you , Tom ? " She started the car and drove around the corner to Montgomery Street . " Please call me . I 'll cook you a shark's-fin dinner . " She stopped the car in front of the same building . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of the car and slammed the door . But he was polite . " I 'll call you , " he said , smiling . " Give my best regards to your mother . " " Now we 've gotten rid of everybody , " Miss Tung said as she  | drove the car away . " Let 's do some shopping . I have a charge account at the White House . Then we 'll start for Carmel . We 'll spend the whole week end there . " " That 's how you make people pay for your gas ? " Wang Ta asked grimly . " Why not ? " Miss Tung said cheerfully . " I never buy gas myself . " " And you told both of them to call you tomorrow . " " What 's wrong with that ? " Miss Tung said laughing . " Let them call . It 's not a crime if I 'm not in . " " Let me out at the next block , " Wang Ta said . " Why ? Do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out . Just let me off . " " What 's the matter ? Are you sick ? " " No , I 'm not sick . Please stop the car and let me off . " " Do n't you want to go to Carmel with me ? " " No . I have a class at eleven . Please stop the car . " Miss Tung slammed on the brakes angrily . Wang Ta got out of the car and hurried away without another word . He was disgusted now and terribly disappointed . The beautiful balloon was pricked , and his heart exploded with it . He remembered Chang 's remarks and wondered why he could n't take love less seriously , as Chang had advised . He must talk to someone . He dropped into a drugstore , went to the phone and dialed Miss Chao 's number .  | After Wang Chi-yang had deposited his cash in the bank , he began to sleep better . One day , in an attempt to show his appreciation for his sister-in-law 's advice , he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into buying . But he acted very stiff that day . He felt uncomfortable in the foreign suit . The trousers seemed too tight ; the open collar of the coat made him feel naked and cold , as though the front part of the clothes had been torn away in an accident . And when he lifted his arms , the sleeves seemed to pull them down ; furthermore , the heavy shoulder pads bothered him , making him feel as if someone were putting his arm around his shoulders . After that day , he packed the foreign suit at the bottom of his trunk and never wanted to wear it again . Because he felt safe now , he sometimes sauntered out of Grant Avenue and ventured to some side streets and back alleys . He discovered , to his surprise , many sights and noises that were both strange and familiar to him . The clatter of mah-jongg behind the closed doors , the operatic music of drums and gongs from basements with signs saying " Music Clubs , " the noodle factories , the tailor shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the high counter , the barbershops with all the traditional services , including cleaning the ears and beating the shoulders , the retired old men reading the Chinese newspapers in little stores which sell nothing . . . all these were familiar to him , reminding him of China . But the bars with the neon signs and the foreign music blaring inside them ; the smokeshops with the blinking machines ; the loud-mouthed young people who talked the foreign tongue , laughed , and drank brownish liquid from bottles all seemed to him somewhat strange . One evening when he was walking out of a back alley , a female voice coughed . He turned and looked . A fat woman with silk-colored hair was standing beside a doorway smiling at him . She tossed her cigarette away and said  | something he did n't understand . Then she pointed at him and pointed at herself , jerked the middle of her body and whispered , " Mama make happy . Good time , savee ? " Quickly Wang Chi-yang turned away and hurried to brightly lighted Grant Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ta 's room that Liu Ma had talked about . Both women had silk-colored hair . Had Wang Ta been going out with prostitutes ? he wondered . He had to find that out . By venturing to the side streets and upper Grant Avenue which he had decided to familiarize himself with despite the fowl and fish smell , he found many items of food that he had missed very much since he had left China . He made a mental note to tell the cook to buy them when he got home , especially the taro roots , the lotus roots , and the dried snake meat and the salted fish , which had always been his favorite dishes . When he was passing by another store , he discovered many other foods imported from China that he had also wanted to buy . In the window of the store were displayed at least a dozen items , with their names written on red paper pasted on the plates and jars which contained the food . He went in and selected ten items  --  sea dragon and sea horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pork ; dog tail and tiger tail , the sex organ of male seals and male tigers which are believed to have great rejuvenating power ; heavenly heroic lizard from Kwangsi Province ; horse hoof from Kwei Ling ; water chestnuts imported from the capital of Kwangsi ; tiger-bone medicine wine ; clean hair vegetable , the hairlike seaweed with great nourishing power ; old-fruit skin , the dried , fragrant tangerine peels ; first-grade bird's-nest from the South Seas ; the stomach of eels imported from Canton . Writing them down , he ordered these items , the prices of which added up to ninety-eight dollars . He paid for them with a hundred-dollar check which Madam Tang had written for him for emergency use . He asked the manager of the store to deliver the food to his house , and to tip whoever was to deliver the goods two dollars , the balance of the check . Having made such exciting discoveries , Wang Chi-yang explored  | upper Grant Avenue some more . His cough was n't getting better and he decided to find some herbs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to have it cured completely . Coughing , in his opinion , was sometimes a pleasure and it seemed to increase a person 's authority in his household . He stopped in front of a herb store and examined the advertisement pasted on the window . It was a public letter cut from a Chinese newspaper , written in classic language by a grateful patient . It said , " Younger brother ( the letter-writer himself ) toured Mexico during his younger years . On account of the hard work and his indulgence in sex and lewdness , he found himself in later years lacking of spirit and energy , and feeling drowsy most of the seasons ; his heart and kidneys being thus damaged , they gradually lost their ability to function . . . " The letter went on and told how the herb doctor in the herb store had built him up again and saved his life with a miracle prescription and the first-class herbs purchased at this store . The herb doctor might be good , Wang Chi-yang thought . He looked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China . Displayed in large Kiangsi plates were these items : Genuine deer's-horn from the North ; genuine fungus from the East ; selected ginseng from the Old Mountain ; deer's-tail from I-Iwei Chung ; effective spiritual cinnamon bark ; great nourishing lizard tea from Wu Hsi . He had been dissatisfied with the ginseng soup he had been drinking ; perhaps he should look into the price of the ginseng here . And the deer's-horn , which looked genuine enough . He had tried most of these tonics in China and they had been effective . He went into the store and was greeted by the manager behind the shiny counter . " Are you interested in buying some genuine tonics from China , sir ? " the manager asked . Wang Chi-yang studied him and thought he was honest . He had a straight nose and clear eyes , although he was wearing glasses ; he looked about sixty but spirited and straight , with good , healthy color in his face . Wang Chi-yang would n't trust a tonic merchant who had a sickly look himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seng and a pair of deer's-horns , in writing . The manager packed the selected tonics in paper boxes and tied them with red cord , then brought his old black abacus to the counter and his fingers worked dexterously on its little balls for a moment . Knowing that the customer did n't understand Cantonese , he wrote the total price on the rice paper with the brush : Thirty-six dollars . After Wang Chi-yang had paid he glanced at the hundred little drawers of the red-lacquered cabinets that covered the whole wall and reached the ceiling ; he read the couplet scrolls that flanked the door leading to an inner room ; he sniffed the air , blended with the fragrance of the herbs . It must be a reputable place , he thought . He picked up the brush and wrote , " Is the herb doctor in ? " The manager read the words , nodded and smiled . He pointed at the doorway beside the counter and nodded again . Wang Chi-yang went into the inner room through the doorless entrance and was greeted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large red-lacquered desk . He was thin but his eyes were shiny and the color of his face was healthy . " Sit down , please , " he invited , indicating a chair beside the desk . " What is your honorable ailment , sir ? " Once again Wang Chi-yang asked for brush and paper . In classic Chinese , with a secret intention to show off his calligraphy , he stated his trouble . The herb doctor pushed his horn-rimmed glasses to his forehead , took the paper under the bare light and read the writing aloud ; then , with a smile , he picked up the brush and wrote in grass style the following comment , " A cough of ten years ' standing is a serious matter , but without resorting to cutting into the abdomen to cure it as a Western doctor will undoubtedly prescribe , Shen Nung , the ancient father of plants who a thousand years ago tasted a hundred herbs to discover their medicinal value , has handed down a cure for coughs of even twenty years ' standing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face intently for his reaction . Wang Chi-yang studied the herb doctor 's grass style and thought it was good , although lacking strength . His composition was faultless , although tinged with the characteristics of a broker . But an herb doctor was not a poet , he thought .  | With such writing ability this one at least was n't a quack . He was satisfied and asked him to diagnose . The herb doctor put a little embroidered cushion in front of him and motioned him to lay his wrist on it . Having examined the pulse in both his wrists , he asked to look at his throat and tongue . When all this was done , the doctor opened the middle drawer in his desk , took out a piece of fine rice paper with his Chinese letterhead printed on the side . He carefully laid it on the table in front of him , closed his eyes , folded his hands , leaned back in his chair , and thought for a moment . Suddenly he opened his eyes , picked up his brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything there is a cause . Every plant that grows on earth is a blessing to mankind if it is correctly utilized with skill and wisdom . The patient has a cough of ten years ' standing , caused by a stubborn wind and a wild fire in the lung , as indicated by his pulse and the color of his tongue . In order to uproot the cause of the trouble , the herbs that will neutralize the wind and the fire in his lungs are therefore prescribed . " Then he proceeded to write the names of the herbs , with their weights marked under them . Wang Chi-yang paid three dollars for the prescription . Before he left , he exchanged a few more pleasant remarks with the doctor in writing , and at parting they bowed to each other politely . He fully agreed with the doctor 's diagnosis and had gained considerable confidence in him . Coming out of the doctor 's office , he went to the manager of the herb store . The manager took the prescription and filled it , weighing each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the herbs in many little packages , then wrapped the many little packages in a large package and tied it with a red cord . Wang Chi-yang took the medicine home and handed it to Liu Ma , who had brewed herb medicine for the family of Wang for more than twenty years . She had become an expert in herbs , and knew exactly what to do with them . Sometimes , by examining the medicine , she could tell from what ailment the patient was suffering . As she opened the packages ready to brew the medicine in an old earthen pot , she knew that the Old Master had had his cough  | treated , for among the items she found some mint leaves and a few dried cicadas ; the former was to fight fire and the latter was to control the wind in the human body . When the medicine was brewed , Liu Ma brought it to Wang Chi-yang 's room and poured the black juice into a large rice bowl in front of him . Old Master Wang drank the bitter juice with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melon to take the bitterness off his tongue . " I have bought some ginseng from the Old Mountain and a pair of genuine deer's-horns , " he said to Liu Ma as the maidservant finished telling him some household news of no significance . " I want you to keep them in a safe place and brew the ginseng for me on the following dates : the 11th , the 15th , the 28th of the 9th moon , and the 2nd of the loth moon . I want to eat the deer's-horn on the 21st of the loth moon . I have consulted the lunar calendar and it said that these dates are the best to take medicine and tonic . " Liu Ma remembered the dates and took the expensive tonic away , pleased with the fact that Old Master Wang still trusted her more than anybody in the house . She had for a long time dreaded that the cook had been gaining favors fast in the family . Ever since the cook had left his restaurant job and returned to the House of Wang , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cooking . And judging from the Old Master 's slightly improved appetite , the cook had apparently been doing a good job . That had worried Liu Ma considerably . Sometimes she had wished the cook would make a bad mistake and displease Old Master Wang ; recently she had even thought of sneaking a tablespoonful of salt into the Old Master 's favorite dish now and then and putting the blame on the cook . Now that she had been reassured of the Old Master 's trust she felt better and decided to postpone this little scheme . Wang Chi-yang visited the herb doctor a few more times , although his cough seemed to be better . He found it a pleasure to visit the doctor and converse with him in writing . Both enjoyed calligraphy and admired the same ancient poets . One afternoon , Wang Chi-yang visited the herb doctor but the doctor had been  | called away to treat a woman patient in her house . Wang Chi-yang did n't want to wait . He came out of the herb store and walked north on Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to venture farther north to the foreign territory called North Beach . It was one of the rare times he had walked beyond the boundary of Chinatown . He sauntered along the sidewalk with apprehension , glancing into the dark bars without turning his head . It seemed to him there were more bars than anything else on the street . Sometimes a whiff of an alcoholic smell would invade his nose , making him scowl and quicken his steps . When he was waiting for the traffic light to change at the intersection of Columbus Avenue and Pacific Street , a heavily made-up woman winked at him and said something he did n't understand . He ignored her , and the woman snorted , then walked across the street without further waiting , swinging her hips . Suddenly Wang Chi-yang felt bad about it . She might be a nice woman asking directions . He had acted rudely and put a black mark on the friendship maintained between Chinatown and the foreign territory . He followed the woman , hoping he could catch up with her and offer her an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wang Chi-yang walked into the Settlement and was amazed by the strangeness of the street . It was full of bars and clubs , with pictures of nude foreign women hanging outside the doors like the poetic banners posted outside the Chinese stores during the New Year . As he looked at some of the pictures , feeling somewhat embarrassed , a man with a false red nose and a black hat hustled him into a club in which a gaudily dressed woman with golden hair was wriggling on a little platform . A three-man band was supplying strange music that sounded like the thumping of a steamship engine . Promptly a slim girl met him and escorted him to the table nearest to the platform . The wriggling girl with the golden hair smiled at him as she started taking off her gaudy gown . " What 'll it be ? " the slim girl asked him , smiling . In an effort to contribute something to the friendship between Chinatown and North Beach , Wang Chi-yang smiled back , dug a  | five-dollar bill out and handed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , " What 'll it be , sir ? " Wang Chi-yang shook his head to indicate that he did n't understand her foreign talk . The girl smiled and went away . Presently she brought him a tall glass of yellowish drink with a cherry on top and a black plate on which were three old dollar bills and some change . He waved at the money ; the girl was puzzled . He pointed at the money and at the girl , and waved again . The girl 's face brightened ; she took the money and thanked him warmly , smiling happily . Wang Chi-yang was satisfied . He had been friendly to the girl and at the same time had got rid of the dollar bills which were too old to keep . By this time the girl with the golden hair had taken off her gown and was prancing on the little platform , jerking the middle of her body to the beat of the loud music , her hands flying , touching her breasts and thighs , or tossing up her long wavy golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled and rounded her lips alternately as if she were blowing something . Wang Chi-yang had never seen such an act in all his life ; in fact , he had never in his life seen any woman so scantily dressed as this one . He looked at the jerking white body and suddenly felt terribly embarrassed . He wanted to go but was afraid of being rude . He took the glass and sipped at the yellowish drink . It was so cold that he almost spat it out . Never in his life had he drunk liquor mixed with ice water . He swallowed it and shivered . It tasted even worse than the bitterest herb juice . He wondered whether it was impolite not to drink the foreign concoction . Now the girl on the platform was going further by taking off the little cover on her breasts , exposing her enormous breasts fully , except the nipples , which were covered with a piece of golden paper the size of a half dollar . That did n't bother Wang Chi-yang too much for he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their babies . But when the girl started to take off the small piece of cloth with golden tassels that hid her middle Wang Chiyang almost jumped . He watched her with wide eyes as she threw the piece of cloth behind the black curtain , pranced to the front  | stage , and tong , tong , tong , tong , she jerked her almost completely nude body right above Wang Chi-yang 's head to the beat of the drum which was rising to a crescendo . Wang Chi-yang shot up to his feet , upsetting the small table , and hurried out of the club , wildly wiping his forehead with his silk handkerchief . His face red with anger , he strode rapidly out of the International Settlement and kept wiping his head . It was bad luck to have a woman jerk the lower part of her body above his head like that . He must hurry home and bathe himself and fumigate his head with incense . He quickly crossed the street and took the same route back . ' While passing a bar beside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his son Wang Ta and a woman sitting at a table talking intimately to each other . He halted and turned slightly to take a look at the woman . She was well-dressed in a gray foreign suit , her black hair swept up and knotted at the top of her head in the fashion of a Taoist priest . She not only looked like a Taoist priest , she was also badly pockmarked . A female Taoist priest with a pockmarked face and dressed in a foreign suit .. . what was she if not a demon ? Greatly shocked , Wang Chi-yang turned and walked away hurriedly . He wondered what was happening to his two sons these days . One stayed out late , associated with foreign women and haunted public bars with a she-demon like this ; the other talked a foreign tongue , ate with his hands , read strange picture books and tossed an ugly ball around every ( lay . He must do something about his sons before they became too wild and foreign . He must talk to his wife 's sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; as for Wang San , perhaps he could deal with him alone . He would first order him to study Confucius and thus impart to him the fundamental Chinese morals ... . l lc walked hurriedly , thinking and worrying , without any idea where he was going . At the intersection of Broadway and Columbus he was completely lost . There were six streets meeting at the tunic point ; unable to read the names of the streets , he looked around with panic . The lights blinked and the traffic roared by . It was not until he spotted a pagoda roof of a tall family associa-  | tion building that he finally found Grant Avenue . With a deep sigh , he plunged into the milling crowd . Once back in Chinatown , he swore that he would never venture to the foreign territory again without first consulting his lunar calendar . It had been a bad day ; he had been followed by the devil , as everything had indicated ill omen . He must hurry home and fumigate himself with incense . Back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma to prepare his bath and burn some incense in his room ; he sent Liu Lung to invite Madam Tang over for urgent conference ; he told his cook to cook a vegetable dinner tonight , for he must prepare himself to ask for the Buddha 's blessing . Madam Tang arrived after Old Master Wang had bathed and fumigated himself thoroughly . He received her in the living room and told her of his adventure outside Chinatown , omitting the nude dancing girl . Madam Tang listened to him with her lips tightly pursed and shook her head with disapproval . " You should not have gone to North Beach , " she said after Wang Chi-yang had finished . " That place is for people who look for song , women and wine . It is a shame for a man of your age to set your feet there . I am glad that nobody robbed you again and no bad woman trapped you . And there are obscene shows in that International Settlement , I am told . You were lucky that you did not wander in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly changed the subject . " My wife 's sister , do you see Wang Ta very often ? " " No , the only time I see him is when he comes to my house to borrow money . My sister 's husband , you are a generous man , but it seems to me that you are very stingy toward your sons ... " " Did he say that ? " Wang Chi-yang. interrupted angrily . " No , of course not , " Madam Tang said . " Wang Ta has always respected you . But you have not treated him correctly . How much do you give him for pocket money every month ? " " Fifty dollars every month . He never asked for more . " " Still fifty dollars a month ? Did you not know that the price of everything has risen twofold ? No wonder he is always short of money . For the last several months he has been borrowing money  | from me . Since he is going to inherit all my money , I did not tell you anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You are spoiling the boy , my wife 's sister , " Wang Chi-yang interrupted . " Do you know what he has been doing ? He has been inviting women to foreign bars ! " Madam Tang looked slightly shocked for a moment , but soon she nodded her head and defended her nephew . " A young man should have some pastime , my sister 's husband . They are living in a modern world . I do not see any harm in inviting a girl friend out and treating her to a drink or two . " " This afternoon he took a pockmarked woman to a foreign bar , " Wang Chi-yang said . " And they drank and talked practically on the street , with every passer-by looking at them like animals in a cage . Do you know that woman , my wife 's sister ? She wears foreign dress and has her hair dressed like that of a Taoist priest . She looks just like a she-devil . " " I know her , " Madam Tang said . " She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fashion designer . Wang Ta has told me about her . There is nothing between them . They enjoy each other 's company like sister and brother . " " Why ca n't he invite somebody else out ? Invite somebody better-looking ? " " It is lucky that he can invite anybody out at all , " Madam Tang said . " There is a shortage of Chinese women in America . Even I , at my age , often receive invitations to go to a motion picture . My sister 's husband , Wang Ta is a good boy . I hope you will not interfere with his social life , and you can trust his words that there is nothing between him and Miss Chao . " " I shall see to it that there will be nothing between them , " Wang Chi-yang said . " I do not want a pockmarked woman for a slaughter-in-law . Her broken physiognomy will bring ill luck to the household . My wife 's sister , the reason why I invite you here is to ask you to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he goes out early in the morning and eats most of his meals outside . And he seems to be afraid of me . This is good ; but he is afraid of me to the point of avoiding me , that is bad . However , I  | must do everything to keep him from going astray . Since he seems to be closer to you than to me , I shall leave his private life to your supervision . And I must remind you , my wife 's sister , giving him too much money to spend is not good supervision . " " I am not concerned about that , " Madam Tang said . " He is an independent boy . He has promised to repay every dollar he has borrowed from me . That shows he will not squander his money , a virtue inherited from my sister . " She looked at Wang Chi-yang narrowly . " By the way , what happened to your foreign suit . You have not worn it for a long time . " Wang Chi-yang coughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it while smoking my water pipe , " he said , trying not to stammer . " About Wang Ta , I hope ... " " We shall not talk about Wang Ta now , " Madam Tang interrupted . " There is nothing wrong with the boy . Please bring out your foreign suit and let me see the hole . Miss Chao is a good seamstress ; I shall ask her to mend it for you . " " It is beyond mending . I shall buy another suit when I find a lucky day in my lunar calendar . " " You can not throw an expensive suit away like that . It cost you a hundred and twenty dollars . Please bring it out . I am a woman , I am the one to tell whether it is beyond mending or not . " To avoid argument , Wang Chi-yang went into his room , but he was determined never to wear that foreign suit again . He opened his iron trunk , dug out the suit from the bottom and proceeded to burn a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first burned a hole the size of a half dollar near the right pocket , then burned a bigger one on the other side to make sure it was beyond repair . He pressed the holes with the palm of his hand to make them look old ; after this was done , he sprinkled a little water from his water pipe on the coat to kill the new burning smell . Feeling somewhat dishonest and guilty , he brought the coat to the living room , his face grim and his heart beating fast . Madam Tang examined the damaged coat with a deep scowl . " Hm , what happened ? " she asked , looking up at him suspiciously . " Did you fall asleep while smoking your pipe ? "  | " The material is made of wool , " Wang Chi-yang said . " It burns easily . " " It must have burned long enough to cook a meal . I am glad the house did not catch fire . Well , I shall take it to Miss Chao and see what she can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extremely deft with thread and needle . " After Madam Tang was gone , Wang Chi-yang went back to his room , feeling sulky . He had had a bad day ; on top of that he had burned a brand-new suit that had cost him a hundred and twenty dollars . If that pockmarked woman was clever enough to mend the holes , perhaps he would have to wear the suit again and the burning would be a waste . He wondered why he had let his wife 's sister meddle with his life . Perhaps he had depended on her too much . In China he would have told her to go to the devil a long time ago . The next day his cough seemed to be worse . He decided to break his daily routine and pay the herb doctor a visit in the morning . He felt that in the whole of Chinatown only the herb doctor had something in common with him . He wanted to visit him as a friend rather than as a patient . The doctor welcomed him warmly and poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about each other 's welfare in their own dialects without understanding each other ; but knowing it was some polite remark of no significance they let it go , and proceeded to converse seriously on other matters in writing . " How is your honorable cough ? " the doctor wrote in grass style , purposely making the characters hard to read to show his scholastic achievement . Without hesitation Wang Chi-yang took over the brush and replied , " The humble cough was gradually retreating after your noble medicine descended upon it , but unfortunately , owing to my own negligence and an incident of ill nature that occurred in my humble home yesterday , the evil illness seemed to regain power this morning . " The doctor read the writing over his glasses , nodded his head , and produced his embroidered cushion from a drawer . He examined Wang Chi-yang 's pulse carefully with his eyes closed ,  | pressing his fingers hard on his patient 's wrist . With the small finger extended like a petal of a blooming orchid , he tightened and relaxed his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang Chi-yang 's pulse . After he had examined the pulse in both wrists , he grunted and produced his special prescription paper with the letterhead ; he laid the paper in front of him , leaned back in his chair and thought for a moment , his face expressionless . A moment later he opened his eyes , pushed the glasses to his forehead and picked up the brush . " The negative and the positive of nature must be in harmony , " he wrote ; " any irregularity of the body function is caused by the disharmony of these two sides of nature . The patient 's pulse , weak at times , shows this discord and therefore it is wise to first balance the nature in his system . . . " It was a long introduction to an elaborate prescription . Wang Chi-yang read it and thought the composition was even better than the last ; the handwriting was also smoother with quite a few strokes containing real strength , an indispensable quality of good calligraphy . Having gained more confidence in the doctor he doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of argument and refusing . " I do not hope that the cough will be cured completely , " Wang Chi-yang wrote . " It is a pleasure to retain a mild cough as long as it does not harm the health and shorten my life . " " It is hard to cure completely a cough of more than ten years ' standing , " the doctor wrote . " But your honorable cough will not affect your longevity , which is indicated in your physiognomy . You have a prominent chin , which dominates your late years , and you have no fear for evil influence invading your late years because of your good mustache , which wards off the evil ; therefore , longevity is safely predicted . " " Do you know horoscope too ? " " Yes , it is part of my profession . But you do not need a horoscope analysis , since your physiognomy is as clear as a heavenly book . " " I have a dog son who has Leached the marrying age , " Wang  | Chi-yang wrote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what type of wife he will have . He was born on the hour of hai , on the second day of the eleventh moon , in the year of the Sheep . " The herb doctor studied the birth date of Wang Ta , counted the years on his fingers with his lips moving slightly . " He is under the influence of fire and water . He is leading a stormy life with many women involved . But these women are not predestined to marry him . It seems to me his predestined lot is in the East . Unless he finds a woman from the East , his married life will not be too happy ; as he was born in the year of the Sheep , he must not marry anyone who was born in the year of the Tiger . " " Will he marry a woman with a broken physiognomy , such as a pockmarked woman ? " " Very unlikely , " the doctor wrote . " But your son has a soft nature , being born in the year of the Sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he is not properly married soon . Since his lucky star is in the East , why not send for a picture bride from Hong Kong ? That will eliminate all the evil elements that might enter his life . " Wang Chi-yang considered the suggestion for a moment , nodding and grunting , then he wrote , " Ever since my humble relative Mr. Tang , the husband of my wife 's sister , passed away two years ago , I do not have anyone in Hong Kong whom I can trust with such a matter . " " Perhaps I can help , " the herbalist wrote . " I know a go-between who is noted for his wide connection and honesty . Perhaps he can find a suitable woman for your son ; and to insure a safe marriage , I shall send him your son 's birth date and his horoscope as I have analyzed it . " Wang Chi-yang 's face brightened . Quickly he picked up the brush and wrote , " Your kind help will be greatly appreciated . Please proceed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarded if the correct woman is selected . My dog son , although not born with unusual talent , is intelligent and passably good-looking . He is honest and knows filial  | piety . . . " He stopped . He wanted to write more of his son 's virtues , but he suddenly became unsure of them . Mutual honesty , he thought , is of prime importance in such a matter . The herb doctor nodded and smiled . " I have no doubt of your son 's virtues , " he wrote . " In order to shoot two vultures with one arrow , perhaps you will also like to consider a woman for yourself ? If your honorable lady is still living , please regard this suggestion as nonsense , for in this foreign land a concubine is not permissible . " " My cheap wife passed away years ago , " Wang Chi-yang wrote . " But I am too old to take another woman . " " No one is too old to marry again , " the herbalist wrote . " This herb store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the undamaged sex organ taken from a male seal at the prime of its years , guaranteed to make a man in his sixties feel as if he were forty ; and it is possible that a man in his late years who takes the tonic regularly will be blessed with three or four more children . " " It is a blessing to have more children , " Wang Chi-yang wrote . " But children born in a foreign land always lack filial piety , it is better not to have them . " " Perhaps you are right , " the herbalist wrote . " But there is no harm in taking a young wife who will serve the sole purpose of warming a cold bed . " " The foreign house in which I live , " Wang Chi-yang wrote , " equipped with foreign contrivances and boilers supplying a steam heat day and night , is already too hot . " Both laughed and nodded in agreement . Wang Chi-yang offered five dollars for the horoscope ; the herb doctor refused it three times before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang Chi-yang went home he felt a warm friendship was growing between them . He had achieved a great deal this morning . When Old Master Wang entered his house , he heard a noise that could only be heard in the house of quarrelsome coolies . He hurried into the living room and found , to his surprise , that Liu Ma and the cook were having a heated argument , whereas Liu Lung  | was busy rubbing Tiger Balm oil on a lump on the head of Wang San , who sat on a chair with some cotton stuffed in his nose . " What is all this ? " Wang Chi-yang asked . Both Liu Ma and the cook stopped shouting for a moment , and Wang San squirmed slightly , then Liu Ma , quicker with her tongue than anyone else in the house , said in one breath that Wang San had been beaten by a wild boy in the Chinese playground on Sacramento Street and she wanted the cook to go out there to give the wild rascal a beating , as this was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ungrateful and cowardly turtle 's egg refused to do her bidding because he said his job was only cooking ... . " Wang San , " Old Master Wang interrupted this soliloquy angrily , " come to my room . " With this he went to the kang , took from behind it a bamboo stick about four feet long , and entered his bedroom , his face red and stern . In his room he took out from his trunk in the closet the Four Books of Confucius , then he went to his chair and sat down , put the books beside the bamboo stick on his desk and waited . What he hated most was his son 's having a street fight . That would be like telling the whole of Chinatown that the family was of a low breed and the father had no control of his wild children , a great face-losing condition . He must discipline the boy and start feeding him with the fundamental morals and virtues of Confucius . " Wang San , " he thundered , as he had waited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang San was standing outside the door trying to work up enough courage to step in . He tumbled in as he heard his name called . " Come closer , " Old Master Wang ordered , his hand on the stick . " How dare you debase yourself by fighting with street ur-chins ? " Wang San shifted his legs and said in Chinese with an English accent and English grammar , " Our teacher says if somebody hits me I must hit back . I do n't want nobody to call me sissy . " When Wang Chi-yang finally digested the statement he was somewhat shocked by this odd teaching . It was then he decided to send the boy to one of the Chinese middle schools in Chinatown  | after his American school , plus an hour of private lessons of Confucius every other evening at home . That perhaps would make the boy act and talk more like a Chinese . As he stared at Wang San 's bleeding nose and the growing lump on his forehead he suddenly became sympathetic . The boy has had enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . " Wang San , " he said , his voice softer now , " our sage has well said , a genuine hero always avoids a fight when confronted with a strong enemy . In order to have you protected in this wild society , I decide to send you to the Chinese school and give you a private lesson of the Four Books of Confucius . " When Wang San saw his father 's hand move from the bamboo stick to the Chinese books his face whitened . Just as he was about to protest , his father had already opened one of the books and started the first lesson . " The Doctrine of the Mean , " Old Master Wang read aloud with piety after clearing his throat . " Chapter One . Confucius says there is nothing more visible than what is secret , and nothing more manifest than what is minute . Therefore the superior man is watchful over himself , when he is alone ... " 7 Wang Ta found a great deal of warmth in Miss Helen Chao 's tiny apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and a few chairs , the living room was cheerful with its fresh flowers , goldfish , and Chinese etchings painted by Miss  | Chao herself . Her bedroom was so small that it resembled a closet , with three sides of her double bed surrounded by walls . Spread on her bed was a beautiful silk cover with an old pine , a peacock , and a few chrysanthemums embroidered on it . It was her own masterpiece , but for some reason or other she had never done another stitch of embroidery since her arrival in America eight years ago . Wang Ta had suggested that she take up embroidery again , but she always avoided the subject as though it pained her to talk about it . When pressed for an explanation she would always say there were a few sad stories in her life she did n't want to be reminded of . She had the most completely equipped kitchen , very neat and clean , with utensils to prepare a Southern banquet , a boatman 's dinner of Central China , or steamed buns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ta to dinner in her apartment and each time the menu was different . Wang Ta loved her tsa-chiangmein , chiao-tze and lao-ping , the famed Northern food which had been introduced to Italy by Marco Polo as spaghetti , ravioli and pizza . She could make the best red-cook pork of the South ; the fragrance of such a dish would fill the apartment for hours , and Wang Ta , when breathing it , would feel hungry even if he was n't . Wang Ta ate many times at her apartment . He did n't know why he spent so much time with Miss Chao ; perhaps his school life was very boring and his frustrations so great that he found Miss Chao 's cozy little apartment a temporary shelter , a resting place after a day 's drudgery . The only unpleasant time was once when Helen Chao encouraged him to take becoming a doctor more seriously , but since she sensed his feelings about medical school she never mentioned it again . Once he wrote to Chang about his school work . Chang replied : . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent dinner served to you and yet you still have no appetite for it . I 've thought of your plight and found there is n't anything others can do to develop your appetite for your medical school . Perhaps marriage can help . But again it depends on whom you marry . Some  | times love can be a great driving force , but where to find love ? That 's what we 've been wondering for years . " Sometimes I also thought of your studying medicine as like a very unhappy marriage . You , the wife , are suffering an acute case of frigidity . The only thing for you to do is to learn from the frigid wives . You either get a divorce or stay with your husband and fulfill your duties . Fulfilling your duties is the only way to save the marriage . It is disgusting work but you must think that you get paid for it and are assured of a comfortable old age . That 's what many frigid wives are thinking , I guess . And in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize hen clubs , bridge clubs , they collect minks , study modern painting , visit handsome psychiatrists etc. , etc . Why do n't you do the same ? Acquire for yourself some hobby  --  hunting , fishing , dancing , swimming , bowling , perhaps even whoring , if it can oil your squeaking scholastic machine and make it less uncomfortable . . . " Wang Ta tore up the letter and decided not to talk to Chang about his school again . One evening he had an elaborate meal in Miss Chao 's apartment . The small table in her kitchen was heaped with dishes from the North , the South , and Central China . She also served him with genuine tiger-bone wine ; after two glasses of it he felt as if he were flying in the air . He protested when Miss Chao poured him a third glass , but Miss Chao was persistent . " What is the occasion , Helen ? " he asked . " No occasion , " Miss Chao said . " I just like to feed you tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass for you , " Wang Ta said , picking up the lead wine pot and filling her glass with the white , warm wine . " Do n't try to make me drunk , " Miss Chao said , smiling . " I have an unusually large capacity , inherited from my great-grandfather , who was a wine merchant and went bankrupt by drinking . " Then she urged him to drink up . " Kan pei , kan pei , please . " Wang Ta drank another glass and the world began to whirl around under his feet . Miss Chao turned out the light and lit two candles . The kitchen was warm and full of the fragrance of food  | and wine . " Drink a little more soup , " Miss Chao said , filling his bowl with her delicious bird's-nest soup . " The soup will dilute the wine so that you can have another glass . Life is short , we might as well enjoy ourselves . " After a fifth glass Wang Ta forgot where he was . The kitchen became a technicolor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blur , and Miss Chao became a double image , which seemed to dance , swim , fly in front of him like Siamese twins . She was beautiful , graceful , angelic . She came to him , said something into his ears that sounded like a soft song , and touched his burning face with the palm of her hand . She kept talking but he did n't understand what she was saying . Presently , she brought him a cup of hot tea , fed him with the spoon , and gradually the heavy drowsiness began to disappear . He felt deliriously happy and lazy and carefree . " You need a little sleep , " Miss Chao said ; " hold me , so you wo n't fall . Hold me . " He held Miss Chao 's shoulders and let her help him up to his feet . " Will you call a taxi for me ? " he said . " I 'm too lazy to drive . " " All right , I shall call a taxi for you . " She helped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while . Take a little nap . I 'll call a taxi for you as soon as you wake up . " Wang Ta fell upon the soft , wide bed ; every muscle , every bone in his body felt relaxed . He had never enjoyed such complete relaxation in all his life before . He closed his eyes and felt he was the happiest man in the world ; he was so lazy that he never wanted to open his eyes again , or to move even a small finger for the rest of his life . Miss Chao took his shoes off ; moved his feet to the middle of the bed , then covered him with a perfumed blanket . He did n't know how long he stayed in the bed in such a delightful semiconscious state and he did n't care . He would n't care even if the house had caught fire and the sky had crashed down . He heard little rustling noises as though Miss Chao were busy doing something . H , e did n't care ; he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted was just to lie there and enjoy the present semiconscious state of well-being . Presently he felt one side of the bed sink a little . Someone had  | crept into the bed beside him . A whiff of strong perfume invaded his nose ; he did n't stir . Then the soft warm body beside him moved closer , nestled against him tightly . And it was a completely nude body ; he was n't surprised , he did n't care ... . He spent the whole night in the bed . It was not until next morning , when he found himself lying in it without any clothes on , that he remembered how much had happened . As he recalled the happenings he was shocked . Feeling guilty , ashamed and angry he quickly jumped out of the bed , threw his clothes on , and without bothering to wash or comb his hair he stormed past the living room toward the front door . " Why in such a hurry ? " Miss Chao called . She had followed him to the living room from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " He could n't bear to look at her . " No , I 'm going . " He quickly stepped out of the apartment , slamming the door . For ten days he did n't call Miss Chao , but the guilty feeling gradually disappeared . He felt that he had acted crudely . Miss Chao had treated him extremely well , cooking for him and consoling him whenever he was unhappy and disillusioned . Besides , that night had not been a bad experience for him , there was no reason why he should be angry and act rude and cruel . He paced the floor in his room , unable to decide what to do . Should he call her or write her a letter of apology ? He went to the hallway and picked up the phone . But just as he had dialed half her number , he threw the phone back into its cradle again . He could n't talk to her ; he was afraid that he might sound silly . He went back to his room and started to write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Miss Chao . . . " Not right . He tore the paper and took out another sheet . " Dear Helen . . . " No . Too intimate . Perhaps he should write her a Chinese letter . In a Chinese letter he could be polite without being stiff ; he could be close without being intimate ; and above all , he could be impersonal . He wrote the Chinese letter , read it to himself and found it satisfactory . He sealed it in a plain white envelope and slipped it into his coat pocket , ready to mail after dinner . While he waited  | for dinner , he tossed on his bed and his thoughts returned to that night at Miss Chao 's apartment . Her passion , her acts , her endearing words , which had shocked him before , came back vividly to him . He could feel the warmth of her body , the smoothness of her skin . In the semidarkness she was n't bad-looking , and she had an excellent round body , with medium-sized firm breasts that hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never noticed before that she had such a good figure . When he thought of all these things , his heart began to beat violently and his face burned . He got up from the bed , took a drink of cold water , paced the floor , tried to read , took another drink of water , tightened his shoelaces , paced some more floor . . . oh , damn it , he was n't hungry at all ; he wondered why he was waiting for something he did n't want . He went to the hallway again , picked up the phone and dialed her number . Her voice was warm . " . . . I have been wondering what had happened to you . Do you like salted fish steamed with ground pork ? I have just steamed one . Why do n't you come over Ind help me eat it ? " " All right , " he said after a moment 's hesitation . " I 'll come in about a half an hour . " Back in his room he tore up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat violently , and he wondered why he was so excited . When he got into his car and started it , he found his hand trembling . After that evening , Wang Ta visited Miss Chao regularly twice a week . He would go there before dinner and stay with her until after midnight . But he never took her out again . Miss Chao suggested many times that they go to a movie or go dancing , but Wang Ta always told her that it was more cozy staying in the apartment . He told her that he seldom enjoyed dancing and he loathed movies . He hated these lies , but since his relationship with Miss Chao had changed he somehow felt a strong reluctance to be seen with her in public again . " What 's the matter ? " Miss Chao asked irritably one evening . " You never want to go out with me any more . It wo n't cost much to go to a movie . If you need money , I have it . " Wang Ta stiffened . He was hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knife . " Which movie do you want to see ? " he said , rising to his feet quickly , fighting an aversion and a strong desire to walk out on her . " Any movie , " Miss Chao said , smiling . " I just want to go out with you , it does n't matter which movie we go to . Let 's drive to Market Street and see what pictures are being shown there tonight . " They drove down Market Street quietly . The brightly lighted thoroughfare was a wonderful sight on a Saturday night . The traffic was heavy , with people milling around on the clean , wide sidewalks , colored lights blinking , taxis roaring through narrow gaps between cars trying to make the green light , impatient drivers honking their horns . A woman driver turned into a one-way street the wrong way , and brakes were heard screeching ; a motor cop came out of nowhere and gave chase to an unknown car for unknown reasons ; a siren screamed somewhere and soon disappeared in the distance . Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " What picture ? " he asked . " Have you made up your mind ? " " Any picture , " Miss Chao said . " It does n't matter . " Wang Ta turned his ' 48 Plymouth sharply into Ellis Street and drove into a parking lot . After the car was parked they walked back to Market Street . " Why do you walk so fast ? " Miss Chao asked . " The movies are continuous . You wo n't miss anything . " Wang Ta did n't say anything . He walked to the nearest movie , and without consulting the colorful posters that flanked the theater in a gaudy display , he bought two tickets . They went into the movies without a word . It was a technicolor picture with costumes of splendid colors and a foreign background . There were a lot of tortures and brutal killings , mingled with love-making , sexy dancing , oratory and incredible feats and bravery . There were slave girls and women soldiers , who fought on horseback with swords and lances and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The picture depressed Wang Ta . He fidgeted in his chair . He had never been so restless  | and uncomfortable before . When the picture was over he got up quickly and said , " Let 's get out of here . " " We have n't seen the news yet , " Miss Chao said . " You have already read it in the newspaper , " he said . " Let 's go . " Outside the theater Miss Chao consulted her watch . " It 's still early . Let 's go to Chinatown and have a bowl of won ton . " Wang Ta was anxious to go home . He realized that it had become a torture to go out with her . He said , " Sorry , Helen , I must go home early . " " Why ? " " I 've got to get up early . " " You were never so conscious of time before . " " I need more sleep . " " It 's only nine . And this is Saturday night . Let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue . I have n't walked on Grant Avenue on a Saturday night for a long time . " Wang Ta started for Ellis Street . " Come on , let me drive you home . " Miss Chao stood beside the theater glaring at him . " Come on , " Wang Ta said impatiently . " Let 's go ! " " Go where ? " Miss Chao asked , her voice angry . " Go home ! " " All you want is that , eh ? " she said . " What do you mean ? " Wang Ta asked . He felt a strong revulsion when he thought of his illicit relation with her . " What do you mean ? Listen , I 'll drop you home and go right back to my own ! " " You are ashamed of me ! " she said . " You are ashamed of going out with me and being seen with me in Chinatown . I began to suspect it since last week , and now I know it ! " Wang Ta became more angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reasonable . . . " But she ignored him . She turned abruptly , walked away and disappeared into the crowd . He attempted to follow her but a great reluctance held him back . He stood there staring at the milling crowd . Yes , he was ashamed of  | her . He could never treat her like an elder sister again , and he could never again appear in public with her without feeling uncomfortable and painfully self-conscious . For two weeks he did n't see her , but Helen Chao kept calling him and apologizing , asking for his forgiveness and inviting him to dinner . Wang Ta remained cold ; in two more weeks she stopped calling . As time went on , Wang Ta 's conscience began to bother him . Somehow he felt that he had done a great injustice to Helen . His brutal attitude toward her made him feel like what the Americans called a " stinker . " He wrote her an English letter asking for her forgiveness . But the letter was never answered . Then he bought a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her apartment but , again , they were not acknowledged . Several times he attempted to call her on the phone , but each time he picked up the phone he changed his mind . He thought that if she had refused to answer his letter , she certainly would refuse to talk to him on the phone . Well , he told himself with a shrug of his shoulders , that was that . He had apologized to her in a long letter and there was no reason why he should feel bad about it any more . He found how surprisingly easy it was to forget a woman when there was no love involved . Two months passed . Wang Ta studied hard and stayed at home most evenings . Sometimes he helped Wang San with his arithmetic in Wang San 's room . Sometimes Wang San was so irked by his study of Confucius that he complained of it to Wang Ta . " You have n't got anything to complain about , " Wang Ta told him . " What d' you think I 'm studying ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confucius . And I have to live on it too , one of these days . " " Yeah , but you do n't have to memorize every word of what you 've studied , " Wang San said . " I have to recite all Confucius ' books , and I do n't understand a word of all that junk . " " But you do n't have to kill others with what you 've studied . I might , " Wang Ta replied . " When you recite Confucius the only man you might kill is yourself and Confucius himself , and he is  | already dead for thousands of years . Now , concentrate on your homework . " Old Master Wang noticed the change in Wang Ta and was pleased . One night he called him to his room and praised his good behavior , then followed with a long lecture on the virtues of Confucius . Wang Ta listened intently and controlled a strong desire to argue on a few points which he regarded as somewhat out of date . He thought that Confucius ' moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by different religions . The Ten Commandments in the Christian Bible , in his opinion , could have been written by Confucius . His main objection to Confucianism was that the sage had put too much emphasis on severity , which created unnecessary inhibition in the human mind and hindered the freedom of thinking . He found out that a man would be happier in this world if he could be more callous and less serious toward life , as Chang had often said . Somehow he felt that his own unhappiness was born out of a formidable inhibition , which created many mental blocks and caused his behavior sometimes to look silly and ridiculous . He always felt obliged , indebted , ashamed , remorseful , and sometimes angry with himself , for the voices in his conscience , dictated by Confucius ' moral codes , kept crying that he was wrong , that he had done a great injustice ... . " Are you listening ? " his father asked , coughing . " Yes , I 'm listening , " he said . Suddenly he was worried by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a doctor about your cough , father . Your cough is getting worse . " " My cough is being treated by a successful herb doctor . He is a good friend ... " " I do n't think a herb doctor can find out what is really wrong with you , father ... " " You do not know anything about coughing , " Wang Chi-yang said , " right now I am talking about your ambition , please lend your ears to me . " He coughed , cleared his throat and went on : " A man should have ambition , and there are four essential steps for a man of ambition to take , as advocated by Confucius . First , he  | should purify and mold his mind ; second , he should complete a home . Unless he has successfully taken the first two steps , he will not be able to take the third and the fourth , which are : To serve one 's country unselfishly and to bring peace to the world . I am glad that you have been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , I and a friend , who is the successful herb doctor I just mentioned , will help you when the time ripens . " Wang Ta had no idea what his father and the herb doctor had been doing in helping his career , but he was n't too optimistic about his own future . When he returned to his room he found a letter on his desk with both his Chinese and English name written on it in a delicate handwriting . He tore it open and found a short note in it : " Mr. Wang : Thank you very much for your kind letter and the roses , which have lain beside my apartment door for two months , as I have been away for that long . Helen Chao " For a moment Wang Ta wondered why she had left San Francisco for two months . Had she been sick ? Or had he hurt her so much that she must go away and have a change of scenery ? He called her on the phone ; at first her voice was cold , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior she warmed up a little . " Where have you been ? " he asked . " I have been away , " she said . " Were you sick ? " " No . " " You sound very mysterious . " " Thank you for calling . I 'll see you some day . " She said goodbye and hung up . Wang Ta felt relieved . She was all right , he thought ; he felt that he had finally paid a debt that had weighed heavily on his mind for a long time . He wrote Chang a letter , telling him of his new attitude toward life . " Never owe anybody anything , " he said ,  | " either emotionally or materially . I definitely believe now that I shall be happier if everybody owes me a small debt or a slight apology . When I owe somebody something , the debt seems to move into my mind like a cowbird forces its way into another bird 's nest and occupies it , keeping peace , its legal occupant , out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and I 'm afraid that this attitude would be strongly opposed by American loan companies and department stores with installment plans ... " Three days later Chang replied , " . . . Toughen yourself , my boy . I still can see that you have a heart that is too soft and comfortable a nest for the cowbird to occupy it permanently . Toughen yourself , I say . I 'll write the following message in English so that in case your old man reads your letter he will not set the F.B.I . on you . Do you know who that Miss Tung is ? A dancing girl from Shanghai 's A Hundred Happiness Dance Hall . Came to this country as a G.I. bride ; divorced her husband three years ago and has been free lancing ' ever since . Do n't fall for her brother ' hoax . It 's purely fictitious . A fellow here has learned all these facts through some bloody experiences . Said she wanted to get even with men . Her attitude is exactly the opposite of yours . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just watch out ! By the way , how far have you gone with her ? ... " Wang Ta answered this question immediately . " . . . I have gone as far as becoming her brother . ' We were about to go to Carmel as husband and wife , but the car broke down . It 's the will of heaven . I took a hint from providence and stopped at the brother ' stage . . . " Wang Ta never told anyone of his affair with Miss Chao , although he almost confided it to Chang in a letter . Now he thought the whole thing was over and he was glad of it . One morning when he was sorting the morning mail , he found a small pink letter addressed to him in a delicate handwriting . He frowned slightly as he opened it . As he had guessed , it was from Miss Chao : It was an intimate letter , written in Chinese , inviting him to a ho-kuo dinner in her apartment . " I have finally succeeded  | in buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is not as good as a Shanghai ho-kuo but it is made of good bronze with a good-sized charcoal compartment in the center . The boiler itself is large enough for six bowls of water . The food cooked in it will be more than enough for you and me . Do you like meat dumplings cooked with white cabbage and rice noodles ? It is my favorite ho-kuo dish . Will you come to share it with me , dear ? " The letter made Wang Ta uncomfortable . It sounded too intimate ; probably because it was written in Chinese , a conservative language . A slight show of sentiment would sound natural in English , but in Chinese it sticks out uncomfortably . The word " dear " bothered Wang Ta a great deal . He decided to refuse the invitation . He wrote her a polite letter saying that the coming examination would keep him very busy . Just as he was ready to go out and post the letter , the phone rang . He went to the hallway and answered it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful . " Have you received my letter ? " " Yes , " Wang Ta said . " I 've just written you a letter ... " " Can you come tomorrow ? " she asked enthusiastically . " I 'm afraid I ca n't . The winter examination ... " " Oh , please come , " she interrupted . " It is my birthday . Please do n't bring anything . I always refuse presents on my birthday . " Wang Ta was trapped . Nobody could refuse a birthday invitation without a good reason ; besides , she mentioned a present ; if he did n't go she might think he was trying to avoid buying her a present . He accepted the invitation , feeling slightly irritated at her statement about refusing any present . It was just like saying , " Oh , you can come . I wo n't ask you for anything . " The next day he bought a pair of jade earrings for her , but returned them and bought a silver cigarette box instead . Earrings were too intimate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any birthday present that would be misleading . He decided to stay there for only a few minutes . Lucky it was a party , he thought , not a date . He could leave a party anytime without offending anybody . He arrived at her apartment at seven P.M. When she answered the door he was a little shocked . She was beautifully dressed in  | a gold brocade Chinese gown , with pearl earrings and a necklace , but her face was so red that he almost did n't recognize her at first . If she had n't greeted him , he certainly would have thought that he had come to the wrong door . What the devil has happened to her face ? he wondered . " Come in , " she said cheerfully . " The ho-kuo is almost ready . " He came into the living room and gave her the present . " Oh , I told you not to bring anything , " she said , looking at him affectionately . When he quickly looked away , there was a moment of awkward silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of the radio-phonograph combination in a corner . There were no other guests in the room . " Am I too early ? " he asked . " No , no , " she said after a moment . " You are just on time . I asked you to come at seven , did n't I ? " " Where are the other guests ? " " I have n't invited other guests . The ho-kuo is only big enough for two . Please sit down . I shall bring you a glass of wine . " " No , no , " he said hastily . " I ca n't drink tonight . I have to study . I can only stay for a little while . " There was a moment of silence . " Of course , " she said . " I 'll have dinner ready in no time . " She put the present on the radio combination , almost upsetting one of the candles . With a nervous laugh she hurried to the kitchen . Wang Ta was bothered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked funny to him . He almost wanted to turn on the lights and take a good look at it to see what was wrong . Had she burned her face ? Has she just recovered from scarlet fever ? He sat on the davenport and wondered . Waiting for dinner uncomfortably , he picked up some magazines from under the tea stand beside him . As he leafed through the magazines , he discovered a little pamphlet entitled " The Sandpaper Treatment , " lodged between the pages of a woman 's magazine . He looked at the illustrations in the pamphlet and suddenly realized what it was . He brought it close to the candles and read a few paragraphs in it . No wonder her face is as red as a monkey 's bottom , he thought . She just had a  | sandpaper treatment , the newest treatment for a pockmarked face . He seemed to have read about it in a digest magazine some time ago . With a chuckle he quickly replaced the pamphlet , put the magazines under the tea stand and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room and announced dinner . Her voice was a little too cheerful to be convincing . That made Wang Ta more uncomfortable . The kitchen was even darker , for there was only one candle , not on the table but on the icebox fifteen feet away . Miss Chao nervously poured a glass of wine for him as he sat down at the table . " Just one glass , " she said . " It 's longevity wine . You must drink it . We are going to have some longevity noodles besides the ho-kuo . " She lifted the lead lid of the bowl-shaped ho-kuo , which was set on a wooden square in the center of the table . The charcoal was buming in the charcoal compartment in the center , with the food boiling mildly around it . She then picked up a large spoon and served Wang Ta a bowl of soup from the steaming ho-kuo . " Please help yourself to the meat dumplings and the cabbage , " she said . " The rice noodles in it are long , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laughed nervously and hurried away to attend to the longevity noodles which were boiling on the stove . The kitchen was hot and filled with the smell of spicy food . Wang Ta was n't hungry , but he found the food in the hokuo delicious . " Please sit down and eat the ho-kuo , " he said . " It is wonderful . " " Do you really like it ? " She sounded pleased . " If I had some genuine chin-chin and mo-erh  --  you know , the imported dried flowers of the lilylike species and the black fungus  --  I could make a much better ho-kuo dish . But I did n't have time to shop for these delicacies in Chinatown . Next time I shall prepare a real ho-kuo for you . " Wang Ta wanted to inquire about her treatment , but on second thought he changed his mind . It was a touchy subject . She might be very sensitive about it since she had turned all the lights out . The whole thing seemed pitiful and wretched . Her nervous laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contribute to  | his discomfort . He was anxious to finish the dinner and leave , The longevity noodles were cooked with shrimps and dried mushrooms . They were served in delicate bowls . " The noodles are also long , " she said , bringing him a dish of soybean sauce . " You can roll them around your chopsticks and eat them . Please do n't bite them in two . I 'm superstitious tonight . " " Please sit down and eat something yourself , " Wang Ta said . He picked up his wine glass and proposed a customary toast : " Wish you a longevity comparable to that of the South Mountain , and a fortune as wide as the East Sea . " She sat down and tossed down her drink . " Thank you , Ta , " she whispered . The grateful quality in her voice made Wang Ta scowl nervously . Why should she feel grateful and make such an effort to please him ? She just made him more uncomfortable . He stole a glance at his watch , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had intended to stay only for a few minutes ; now he must have stayed over half an hour . How he would have enjoyed the food and the evening if their relationship had remained purely platonic ! he thought . They had had a great deal to talk about before . They had discussed everything under the sky and above the earth ; now , every moment seemed to be awkward and it was such a strain to find anything to say . He put down his bowl and chopsticks and said apologetically , " I really have to go now . I have to study for my examination . Thank you very much for the ho-kuo . " Miss Chao put down her chopsticks and picked them up again , her hands were shaking . Wang Ta was glad that it was so dark in the kitchen . He did n't want to see the hurt expression on her face . " Of course , " she said cheerfully after a moment , but there was a great effort in her voice . " You can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil the water . You must taste my Black Dragon tea with the aster flowers . A friend sent it to me from Formosa . It will be ready in three minutes . " She got up from her chair and hurried to the stove . " You can wait for it in the living room if you wish . " Wang Ta went to the living room . He decided to stay ten more minutes , not more . Soon she came in with two glasses and a bot-  | tle of whisky . " You have n't finished my longevity drink yet , " she said . " It is bad luck not to finish it . " She put the glass on the tea stand beside him . He noticed that she had added some liquor in his glass . " Kan pei , kan pei , " she said , lifting her own drink up in a great effort to appear cheerful . " Sorry , I ca n't finish the drink , " he said . " I must go home and study " " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be ready in a moment . Kan pei , please . " Wang Ta took a sip from his drink , while Miss Chao tossed hers down and poured herself another , her hands shaking so badly that the glass and the bottle rattled . Wang Ta watched her and found the change was really shocking . She seemed to be a nervous wreck now . She sat down in a chair opposite him , gulped down another mouthful of drink , put the drink on the floor and picked it up again as if fighting a mental battle . " Will you marry me , Ta ? " she suddenly said , looking at Wang Ta anxiously . For a moment Wang Ta was dumfounded . " Please marry me , Ta , " she said again , flinging herself at his feet . She knelt down on the floor and grabbed both his hands , looking at him pleadingly . " Please marry me . I 'll do anything for you , Ta . " Strong revulsion made Wang Ta want to withdraw his hands from her grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my face , " she went on anxiously . " I 'm cured now . I took the bandage off this morning . The doctor gave his guarantee that I shall regain my normal color in a month or two . I have his written guarantee . I can show it to you if you want me to ... " Wang Ta ransacked his brains for something appropriate to say ? something that would not hurt her . " I 'm not independent , " he said , trying to avoid her eyes . " I ca n't get married until I finish medical school . " " You do n't have to support me , " she said hastily . " I can make a good living . " " No , I ca n't do that , Helen . " " Why ? Tell me why ? " " I  --  I ? do n't want to get married , that 's all .  | " Love will grow , Ta , " she said , tightening her grip . " Love will grow after marriage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the word " love " repelled him . " No , I 'm sorry , " he said bluntly . " I ca n't marry you . Let 's not talk about it any more . " He made an attempt to get up but Miss Chao would n't let his hands go . " All right , do n't marry me , " she said , her voice a bit hoarse now . " But come to see me every week . You do n't have to take me out . We 'll stay just in my apartment . I 'll cook for you , do anything for you " " I think we should not see each other any more . Please let me go " Promise to come once a week , Ta , " she said , her voice desperate now . " Just once a week . Let me cook for you . You can leave any time you wish ... " Wang Ta forced his hands out of her grip and got up . " I have to go now , I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chair . She picked up her glass from the floor and took a long drink from it . " You are still ashamed of me , " she said . " I 'm not ashamed of you , " Wang Ta said . " I just do n't love you . I do n't think I shall ever be able to fall in love with you . I ca n't help it . I ca n't force myself to love ... " Miss Chao suddenly crushed her glass between her fingers . " All right , get out , " she said , staring blankly ; the unfinished drink dripped on the floor and blood began to ooze out of her fingers . Wang Ta hurried out of the apartment ; he felt extremely unhappy . Helen Chao seemed to him terribly pitiful , but he simply could n't love a woman because of pity , and in the meantime he hated himself for being so cruel . It was such a painful experience that he wished he had never met Helen Chao . Back home he wanted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event still bothered him , like something with a bad taste lingering in his mouth . Having been raised in China , he was as sympathetic to pockmarked people , the victims of smallpox , as he was to those crippled by polio . His treatment of Helen Chao  | somehow made him feel as though he had kicked a cripple . He heard his father call Liu Ma to brew his herb medicine . A few minutes later he again heard Liu Ma shout to Liu Lung , her husband , telling him to buy sugared winter melon for the Old Master . He remembered that his father always ate something sweet to take the bitter taste off his tongue after he had drunk the herb juice . Perhaps he should do the same . He closed his book and went to a movie . He went to a lot of movies in the following two weeks . Some of the movies were good " sugared winter melon . " They not only helped remove the bad taste from his mouth , they sometimes even boosted his morale a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Little Kidnappers . " He felt good as he came out of the theater , for the touching story provided an outlet for some of his pent-up emotions . It was one of the rare motion pictures that warmed his heart instead of trying to please his eyes with grandeur and resplendence in color . He walked into the street feeling like a man whose stuffed nose is suddenly cleared . He bought a copy of the evening paper , took a deep breath of the cool , fresh air and went into a corner restaurant to have a cup of coffee . As he sipped the coffee and scanned the newspaper , a little item printed in a corner on the second page attracted his attention . Chinese Woman Found Drowned on Ocean Beach , the headline said . " ... The body of an attractive Chinese woman was discovered yesterday morning by Miss Jean Parker , a legal secretary on her vacation . Miss Parker called police , who found the partially clad body on the beach , apparently washed ashore the night before . She was identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universal Clothing Factory on Stockton Street . Her car was found later , parked on the Great Highway , near Golden Gate Park . Her purse , which lay open on the front seat , carried her driver 's license and other identification ; her billfold was empty , lying on the floor . The police are uncertain whether she had been robbed and murdered , or whether she had drowned herself . There was no suicide note . "  | Wang Ta cashed his monthly hundred-dollar check at On On ' Drugstore and decided to spend some of it . He had no idea why his father had doubled his monthly allowance . Probably because the old man thought he had " reformed " and wanted to give him some kind of reward . If the extra money was really meant to be a reward for his merit or moral life , he thought , he had to throw it away as stolen money . His private life had been a mess , not only immoral , but also heavily burdened with guilt . Ever since Miss Chao 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North Beach but he avoided the brightly lighted spots . When passing Vessurro , the artists ' bar which he and Miss Chao had frequented , he turned away quickly and crossed Columbus Street . A motorist honked and yelled at him , " That 's jay-walkin ' , fella ! What 's the matter ? Tired of livin ' ? " He liked Vessurro and enjoyed looking at the pictures and the paintings on the wall done by unknown artists . He liked its atmos-  | phere , which was n't gloomy or heavily alcoholic like that in most other bars . Vessurro seemed to him a combination of college cafe and bar of the Bohemian type , patronized by Negro musicians and pale young men in tweed coats and unpressed gabardine trousers who looked like frustrated writers or artists ; they drank beer and carried on intimate and sometimes animated conversations with extremely attractive girls . In a way it was also like a Chinese teahouse . The customer could buy a bottle of beer and spend the whole evening there sipping and talking and nursing an empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely evening ; but tonight Wang Ta could n't bear looking at it . He wanted to go to a dark place , as if his soul could n't stand scrutiny under a strong light . He crossed Columbus and wandered in the dark section of Pacific and Montgomery . He walked past a bar and saw a short Filipino come out with a tall blonde and get into a waiting taxi . She was a pretty girl but drunk ; she waved at him with a little handkerchief through the car window and called drunkenly , " Hi , Charlie . " He wanted to get drunk too . He pushed in the swinging door and went into the dimly lighted bar . The jukebox was blaring cowboy music . He sat down at a small round table near an artificial palm tree and a blonde waitress came over smiling and greeting him cheerfully . He wondered why there were so many blondes in the bar . Sitting at the bar arguing with another Filipino was another one . " You keep your trap shut , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody , I 'll telling ya ! " " O.K. , O.K. , " the Filipino said . " What would you like to have , sir ? " said the blonde waitress in King 's English with a faked British accent . Wang Ta ordered a whisky soda . Sitting at another round table nearby was a middleaged American with thick brown hair and a red face . He was drinking beer and talking to nobody in particular . On his table were four beer bottles , three empty and one half-full . He poured himself another glass and watched the foam swell out of the glass . " Money talk , that 's all , " he said . " Good night , that 's all . " " Next time you keep your goddam mouth shut , " said the blonde at the bar .  | " For Christ sake , " said the Filipino with a heavy accent . " I apologized to you , did n't I ? " " All right , all right ! " said the bartender . " Keep quiet . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cop than I 'm Rita Hayworth , I 'm telling ya , " said the blonde . " If you 're a cop , show me your goddam badge ! " " I was joking , " said the Filipino . " I apologized , what more do you want me to do ? " " I said leave the lady alone , " said the bartender . The waitress came with Wang Ta 's drink . " There are nice people here , " she said apologetically . " See that girl over there ? She is a poetess . " Wang Ta glanced at a dark-haired Caucasian girl , a bit plump , sitting at the farther end of the bar . " She writes poetry . Really pretty poetry . A very smart girl . That 'll be fifty cents , sir . " Wang Ta paid for the drink and tipped her a quarter . " Money talk , that 's all , " said the man with the red face . " No pay , no nothing , that 's all . " The waitress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought him a fresh bottle . She took a dollar bill from the table and made the change without a word . " No business , no pay , no nothing , that 's all , " the man said , pouring himself another glass from the fresh bottle . " That 's all . " " Do n't tell me you 're a cop , " the blonde was still scolding . " It 's none of your goddam business what I do . .. " " Hey , watch your language , lady , " the bartender said . " There are gentlemen around ! " There was some laughter and the blonde became angry . " I 'm sitting here minding my own business , " she yelled , " and that son-of-a-bitch here says he is a cop . Show me your badge , copper ! " " O.K. , O.K. , " said the Filipino . " I apologized , did n't I ? What more can I do ? " " You can get your ass outa here , " said the blonde , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody , I 'm telling ya ! You a copper ! You 're no more a copper than you 're Clark Gable " " Look , honey " " Do n't honey me ! " screamed the blonde .  | " All right , all right ! That 's enough argument for today , " the bartender said . " Let 's have some peace and quiet here . I never had any trouble here and I do n't want any now ... " " Oh , yeah ? " said the man with the red face . A few men laughed and Red Nose raised a hand and added , as if to acknowledge big applause , " That 's all , that 's all ! " " That 's the right atmosphere , " the bartender said , slapping the counter with the palm of his hand . " Everybody happy ! That 's what I run this joint for ! Sally , bring the gentleman over there another bottle of beer . It 's on me ! " The door swung open and two Mexicans came in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to a table in a corner and sat down . The dark one with thick hair and a Spanish mustache glanced at the poetess and jerked his head . The fat one said something in Spanish and they laughed . " Who is she ? " he asked the waitress . " Her name is Joan , " the waitress said . " What 'll it be ? " " Two highballs , " the dark one said . " I 'll buy her a drink . " " Who ? Joan ? " " That 's right . " After the waitress had left the two talked some more Spanish and laughed . When their drinks came , the dark one fished out his wallet from his hip pocket , took a stack of bills out of it , wet his fingers and peeled a twenty-dollar bill off the pile and slammed it on the table . The fat one said something funny and they laughed harder . The waitress took the money and went to make change . The dark Mexican returned his wallet to his pocket with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm of the other , while the fat one kept talking and laughing . Wang Ta watched the two Mexicans and wished he could be as happy and carefree as they . He saw the bartender pour another drink for the poetess and point at the Mexicans , but the girl did n't even bother to look . The dark Mexican glanced at her and drummed the table with his fingers . The fat one proposed a toast in Spanish and downed half of his drink . " Ask her to come over , " the dark one said to the waitress as she came with the change .  | " She wo n't come , " the waitress said . The dark one flipped a dollar bill on the table after the waitress had made the change . " Buy her another drink . " " You can buy her ten drinks , but she wo n't come , " the waitress said . " Buy her another ! " " O.K. ! " The waitress took the dollar bill and came to Wang Ta 's table . " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , smiling . Wang Ta wondered why the waitress changed her accent and attitude whenever she talked to him . Did she think he was an F.B.I . agent or a movie talent scout or something ? he thought . He ordered another whisky soda . " You know what ? " the waitress whispered to him . " Joan is crippled . Automobile accident . You can buy her ten drinks , but she wo n't move . She just sits in that corner all night . She writes really pretty poems . Was on television just last week . You can talk to her if you wish . A real nice girl . " " That 's all , that 's all ! " the man with the red face said suddenly . Some people laughed . A dark Spanish girl turned to him and asked , " What 's up , pops ? " Red Face raised his hand and said to nobody in particular , " That 's all ! " Everybody turned to look at him but the poetess . Wang Ta watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wondered what was troubling her . She must have other troubles besides being crippled . As one unhappy person to another , he decided to make her acquaintance and have a little chat with her . He picked up his glass and went to the corner and sat on the stool beside her . " I understand you 're a poetess , " he said politely . " May I buy you a drink ? " She turned slightly . " Who told you ? " she asked . " The waitress , " Wang Ta said . " She says you write beautiful poems . " " Oh , " she said , taking a drink from her glass , her hand shaking slightly . Wang Ta bought her a drink and asked , " What kind of poems do you write ? "  | " Oh , everything , " she said . She lighted a cigarette and her hand shook more now . " Have you had any poems published ? " Wang Ta asked . " I 'd like to read them . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable . There was a moment of silence between them . Wang Ta took a deep drink and said , " I 'm sorry you had a car accident . When did it happen ? " The girl turned to him and glared . " Who told you ? " " The waitress . She said you are crippled . I 'm sorry it happened . " " I do n't need anybody 's sympathy , " she said , her voice angry . She crushed her cigarette nervously and said to the bartender , " Joe , tell Pat to quit being so big-hearted , I do n't want sympathy from anybody ! ' " What 's the matter , Joan ? " the waitress asked , coming over to her quickly . " What 's wrong ? " " Just shut your mouth about me , " she said angrily . " What 's the matter ? " the waitress said . " He 's nice , is n't he ? You want somebody nice to talk to , do n't you ? " Joan took a drink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . " I do n't want you to broadcast all over the country that I 'm crippled ; it 's nobody 's goddam business ... " " O.K. , O.K. , " the waitress said hastily , " do n't get so mad . I was just trying to help . .. " " And I 'm no poet , " Joan said . " I do n't write poetry . Just keep your mouth shut about me ; I do n't want nobody 's goddam ... " By this time the waitress had put a dime into the jukebox and loud music began to blare , drowning Joan 's complaint . " I 'm sorry I upset you , " Wang Ta said . " Please have another drink . " He left a half dollar on the bar and got off the stool . When he pushed the swing door open he heard Red Face shout above the music , " That 's all , that 's all ! " Outside the bar Wang Ta walked aimlessly for a moment . The incident depressed him . The nervousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so sensitive about their physical de-  | fects he did not know . Joan was a beautiful girl ; she had an excellent profile , with straight nose and full lips and a high forehead . He would have invited her to shows and to dinners if she had accepted people 's kindness . Physical defects did n't bother him any more . He would n't even mind marrying a cripple if she was nice . He turned on Clay Street and walked toward Kearny . When he was passing the police department in the old City Hall building , a policeman stopped him and greeted him in Cantonese . " Ni ho , ni ho . Mei fei ? Yat men yat chung . " The policeman showed him two tickets and asked him to buy . Wang Ta had no idea what they were but bought the tickets for two dollars . " Bring your best girl friend , " the policeman said . " Lei pei lu pa dem chung . Zai chian , zai chian . " Wang Ta slipped the tickets into his pocket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow street was as heavy as ever . On the sidewalks young lovers strolled arm in arm , window shopping ; old couples admired the pagoda roofs and studied the menus pasted outside the restaurants ; a balding husband , carrying an infant , followed his wife reluctantly into a gift shop . Their young daughter tagged along , looking at the display in the window and screaming with delight . The street was full of life , but Wang Ta was gloomy . Lively and bright places seemed to make his existence seem more destitute and futile . He hurried home , threw himself on his bed in his room , trying to fight off the furious depression . He dug out the tickets the policeman had sold him . He studied them . " Policemen 's Annual Ball , " it said . " Dancing to the music of Richard Stern &; Orchestra . . . " " Bring your best girl friend , " the policeman had said . He stared at the ceiling and wanted to laugh . He did n't even have one girl friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take place Friday evening . That 's tomorrow , he thought . It would be short notice even if he had someone to invite . He tossed the tickets into the wastebasket and turned on the radio . A comedy show was reaching its climax  --  singing , laughing and cheering ; he turned it off . Suddenly a terrible loneliness attacked him . He quickly got up from the bed , went to his desk , and wrote a letter to Chang :  | " ... I think my staying in America is a waste of my father 's money ; besides , he probably does not have much of it now ... . My existence here , it seems to me , is meaningless . The sense of futility , of uselessness and of being unwanted is about to break me down . . . . You may think I am out of my mind , but I am at this moment seriously considering going back to Mainland China ... " He felt slightly better after he had posted the letter the next morning . Two days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of sending you a telegram but I changed my mind , for it might alarm your old man and he might demand a translation of it . Then I wanted to write you an airmail letter , but since the difference between airmail and ordinary mail from Los Angeles is only a matter of hours , I again decided I might as well save the three cents . At first glimpse , your problem seemed to be urgent , but now , while writing you this note , I think your problem is no more serious than that of an incorrigible street urchin who needs a good spanking . I am flying to San Francisco for the week end . Please wait for my phone call around four P.M. Saturday . " Wang Ta met Chang at the airport the following Saturday afternoon . Chang looked even healthier and more spirited than before . He was still wearing the old tweed suit he had bought at a sale in Berkeley four years ago . " Look at my hands , " he said as they drove to Chinatown in Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor did it . The hands of the typical proletarian . The most outstanding change since I quit my intellectual life is the change of my hands . " He spread his hands and looked at them admiringly . " The hands of strength and toughness help to bring food to my own mouth and potatoes to those of my fellow men . Ever since I became a grocery clerk , I 've achieved a strong sense of being wanted and useful . " Wang Ta looked at Chang 's hands and found they were roughened , with broken nails and healed scratches . " Do you think I should follow your steps ? " he asked . " For heaven 's sake , no ! " Chang said . " If I had been as lucky as you are , I would n't have become a laborer at all . What 's wrong  | with studying medicine ? Your father has the money , and you have the youth . " " Are you preaching ? " " Yes , I 'm preaching . But I 'm not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Be happy , be contented ! . . How to achieve peace of mind ! ' and so forth and so forth . I 'm going to give you a little analysis of the world situation and let you draw your own conclusion . Are you still considering going back to China ? " " Yes . " " Good . It gives me a chance to talk . There are two camps in this world today : The Soviet camp and the American camp . Going back to China means joining the Soviet camp , have you realized that ? " " No , " Wang Ta said . " I just want to lead a normal life , doing something and being useful . And I do n't want to do things I do n't want to do and I hate trying to be something I am not capable of being . " " Good , " Chang said . " You 're an honest man . But you must realize that in this country perhaps you are only refused the opportunity to do what you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what you do n't want to do . Let me quote some of Lenin 's own words . As long as capitalism remains , we can not live in peace , ' he said . The basic rule is to exploit conflicting interests of capitalist states and system , ' he said . In doing so , we have to use ruses , dodges , tricks , cunning , unlawful method , concealment and veiling of truth . ' If you want to join their camp , you 'll invariably be forced to do all these . As an honest man , you can not happily plunge into jobs that are entirely against your nature . Even I , a man not nearly as honest as you are , find the communist medicine a bit hard to swallow . This sounds like propaganda , but it 's a fact we have to face ; and you have to constantly bear in mind that communism and capitalism are like fire and water , they will never mix . As long as there is capitalism , communism will fight it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weed that can be uprooted easily . "  | " I do n't think it is necessary for anyone to join the fight , " Wang Ta said . " It is absolutely necessary if you go back to China  --  Red China , I mean , " Chang said . " Have you forgotten what Mao Tse-tung said a few years ago ? Either you turn to the left , or turn to the right , there is no middle way , ' he said . " " Have you honestly turned to the right ? " Wang Ta asked . " Would I preach if I did n't ? Listen , besides moral reasons , there are practical reasons that you must turn to the right . First , you are like me , you wo n't fit in the communist picture . You are too old to convert ; even if you could , they would n't trust you . Second , China  --  I mean Red China  --  is like an inflated bullfrog which is wore of a bluff than a real great power . You and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Manpower , especially manpower composed of starving men , is no immediate threat in this atomic age . Mao Tse-tung understands that ; he will have to depend on Soviet Russia for everything else if he wants to wage an all-out war against America . This is as clear as a bride 's mirror . Suppose the mirror is n't too clear to Mao Tsetung ; suppose he wants to get tough , will Soviet Russia go along with him ? It is a question . If the only supply line  --  the transSiberian railroad  --  is bombed out , Red China will have nothing to feed the enormous war monster but human lives . But war is still possible . When the Kremlin is irritated and thinks that Mao Tsetung is outgrowing his breeches , it might be happy to see him suffer a few broken ribs . Ah , I 've been talking like a soap-box orator again . I 'm hungry . Where shall we eat ? " " Have you tried Chi Chi ? " " Have I tried it ! When I lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the proprietor started calling me by my first name and sending me Christmas cards in the New Year . He does n't read English , I guess . My favorite dishes there are medicine pigtail soup and smoked duck feet steamed with pork . Let 's go there . I would like to see Charlie again . See if he has stopped smiling . He never did since he bought that restaurant fifteen years ago . He wanted to make a million and retire to his  | village in China . Say , are you still considering going back to China ? " " I do n't know , " Wang Ta said . " Somehow you 've swayed me a little . " " Good , so then I can stop talking politics for a while . I have n't talked politics for so long that I can talk about it day and night . You know what I 've been talking about since I became a grocery clerk ? Bowling . Now I 'm a bowling expert . I 'm the leader of the Black Dragon team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides being good exercise , it 's also good for the mind . " " What do you mean ? " " In another word , it 's good for mental health . It must have prevented a lot of people from going crazy . If you get into an argument with your employer and have to accept your defeat for the sake of your job , you can always go to a bowling alley and let off your steam by smashing the pins and imagining they are your boss and his family , including his mother-in-law . When you go home , you feel happy and no longer hold grudges against the world . Most of my bowling friends agree with me . Now I 've bought my private ball , and a canvas bag to carry it in . Perhaps you should also try . " " I 've tried . All I get out of it is frustration . " " That 's your trouble . You 're afraid of hurting anything , even the pins in a bowling alley . " " I just ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my soft heart or anything . " " I 'm going to tell you a story , " Chang said . " But right now I 'm too hungry to tell it . Step on the gas , please . Heavens , I can smell the pigtail soup at Charlie 's now ! " They drove to Chinatown and parked the car four blocks away from Chi Chi on Jackson Street . Parking was one of the biggest problems in Chinatown and Wang Ta had learned to take the first space in sight without worrying about a little walk . Chang was really hungry ; he bought a package of peanuts and ate his way to Chi Chi . " I ca n't stand hunger , " he said . " This is my real reason  | for staying in this country . You can give America at least one good credit  --  no one starves . " They climbed the stairs of the old red-lacquered wooden building in which Charlie had been running his typical Cantonese restaurant for fifteen years . Chang grabbed Charlie 's hand and pumped it half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aiya ! Mr. Chang ! " the little man cried happily . " It is you ! For a moment I thought you a gangster ! " " I know how frightened you were , " Chang said . " You actually stopped smiling for ten seconds . Have you made your million yet ? " " Just about , " said Charlie , laughing . " In Chinese money , though . You look good . Like big shot . Where you been ? " " I 've moved to Los Angeles . I take this special trip here to eat your medicine pigtail soup . " " You 've come the wlong day , " Charlie said . " Seaweed soup for today . It is good . Come to this loom , please . The best loom ? like it is leserved for you . " He escorted them to one of the four little rooms facing the street and let down the white door curtain , then he busily brought them today 's menu and served them tea . They ordered a squid fried with Chinese cabbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , and smoked duck feet steamed with pork . The last item was n't in the day 's menu , but Charlie insisted on preparing the dish for them . Wang Ta had come to the restaurant twice before and he liked the genuine Cantonese food . There was no decoration in the restaurant to please the tourists , and few tourists knew the restaurant 's existence anyway . The red-lacquered walls were dingy with age ; the customers sat on long wooden benches and ate their meals under bare lights . The cooks prepared the food in huge built-in boilers that resembled upturned umbrellas without handles . Except the ancient cash register which rang and rattled at the same time , everything in the restaurant was Chinese . It invariably reminded Wang Ta of the small-town restaurants in China and made him homesick . " What about the story you wanted to tell ? " he asked as he finished the seaweed soup . Chang attacked the squid with relish . " The story is about a pair  | of romantic Siamese twins , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Liu brothers of Kiangsi Province . Probably you have heard about them . " " I read about them in the papers years ago . " " Yes , at the age of sixty-five they still exhibit themselves occasionally to raise money for their children 's education . They look exactly alike . To avoid confusion , people have to remember their names with a little mental note such as , Liu Shun-ti , right , the elder ; Liu Shun-kai , left , the younger . ' When they were little , their parents tried several ways to separate them , including tying the meat tube ' under their arms with a guitar string to stop its blood circulation . They almost died . After that , no more attempts were made to separate them . " Well , the twins made a lot of money exhibiting themselves . Both are married and have a lot of children . One day Liu Shun-kai , left , the younger , wanted to take a concubine . But Liu Shun-ti , right , the elder , objected . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They banged each other with their heads until their father sent for a carpenter to make a partition for them . But the wooden partition proved to be a nuisance . A few months later , the twins agreed to get rid of it by promising their father peace . But Liu Shun-kai , left , the younger , still wanted a concubine . . . " Chang took a fishbone out of his mouth , swallowed a large mouthful of rice without much chewing and went on , " Well , the problem had to be solved . Through friends ' mediation and their friends ' persuasion , Liu Shun-ti , right , the elder , finally okayed his brother 's request . " He gulped down a mouthful of tea and paused for a moment to indicate a short time lapse . " Three days after the younger took a concubine , the elder , for some reason or other , decided to take one too . It is said that the six of them  --  the twins , the wives , the concubines  --  lived happily together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concubines decided to run away with another man and have some privacy . " Wang Ta chuckled . " What 's the moral of the story ? Are you preaching something ? "  | " Naturally , " Chang said after gulping down a mouthful of tea . " When you told me you would never enjoy bowling , you sort of reminded me of Liu Shun-ti , the elder , who hated concubines at first . " " Are you trying to get business for some bowling alley ? " Wang Ta asked , smiling . " I 'm trying to sell you a new attitude , " Chang said . " A lot of people are too stubborn about their likes and dislikes . They never . compromise . Take me , for instance . When I was a Ph.D. , I was an intellectual . I scorned a lot of things ; I refused to associate with a lot of people . One summer , through my uncle 's influence , I took a trip to Washington , D.C. , and stayed with the Chinese ambassador . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed at the Waldorf-Astoria . I dined with diplomats and danced with a European duchess at a party given by the governor of New York . I thought I belonged to that society . If I had known that I would become a grocery clerk today , I would have committed hara-kari . " He put his chopsticks down , poured some octopus gravy into his rice and went on : " But now I discovered a new world , like Liu Shun-ti , the elder , discovered the pleasure of a concubine . Now I 've realized how dull some of the so-called intellectuals and aristocrats really are . On the other hand , I 've found the simple working people delightful and much easier to get along with . And I found it much more so after I became one of them . And yet those are the people with whom I would n't dream of associating years ago . In those days , I had a deep-rooted idea that they were nothing but a bunch of harum-scarum , pigeon-brained dull lowbrows . Last week I met a laundress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time at bridge and crossword puzzles ; her husband , a janitor , is the best living philosopher I 've met . And yet they are simple , naive , easy to understand ; living among them you find life so much easier . Ah , I 'd better stop talking about the simple working people , otherwise I 'll go on and on until I begin to sound like a communist . " " I get your point , " Wang Ta said . " I think it 's a matter of adjustment . "  | " Exactly , " Chang said . " By compromising , by being more objective , by trying to adjust yourself , you will find there is something nice about everything . Oh , heavens , now I sound like a schoolteacher . Let 's finish the dinner and go some place . I have a few places in Chinatown I would like to visit again . They used to be my old hunting ground . " " Hunting ground ? " Wang Ta looked up curiously . " Hunting what ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was pretty lonely in those days . Say , you are not eating much , what 's the matter ? " " I 'm not too hungry . " " I 'm not hungry any more , " Chang said . " But I 'll keep on eating . Next week I 'll go back to American steaks again . I 'm tired of steaks . But they are so cheap at wholesale price that it 's a crime not to eat them . " They finished dinner , paid , said good-bye to Charlie and came down the rickety stairway . Gratified with Charlie 's art of cooking , they agreed that someone should steal his recipes and write a cookbook . The traffic on Jackson Street was heavy ; the whole block was blinking with colorful neon signs of the larger restaurants . The music of drum and gong of a Cantonese opera was in full blast ; the singer 's shrieking voice pierced the cool evening air , turning everybody 's head toward the second floor of the prosperous Universal Restaurant where a wedding banquet was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is married . " Chang said . " I have never attended any wedding banquet in Chinatown . I wonder if it 's the same as in China . " " It 's the same except that the bride is not a bit bashful , " Wang Ta said . " I went to one with my father last year . Long before the banquet was over , the bride dragged the groom away , claiming that they had parked their honeymoon car illegally somewhere . The elders tolerated the lie and continued the banquet until after midnight . Where shall we go ? " " Just follow me , " Chang said , walking toward Grant Avenue . " A place at the edge of Chinatown fascinated me some years ago . It 's  | an artists ' rendezvous . We can buy a bottle of beer , sit in a corner talking , and watching characters . There is no loud music and nobody gives a damn what you do or what you talk about . Once I saw a bearded man scratch his back with a bamboo scratcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , who finally went away with a man with a fortune bird . The fortune bird told her fortune , I presume , and advised her to change partners . " " You mean Vessurro ? " Wang Ta asked . " Yes . At the mouth of Grant . Like a fascinating island at the Yangtze estuary . Have you been there ? " " I would rather go somewhere else if you do n't mind , " Wang Ta said . " You are a character , " Chang said . " I regard all those who do n't like that place as characters , and therefore there is more reason for you to go there . " " Not that I do n't like Vessurro , " Wang Ta said . " I have a private reason for not wanting to go there . " " Ah , it 's getting interesting , " Chang said . " Why ? Did someone break your heart there ? " Wang Ta told Chang of Helen Chao , of their affair and of her death . Chang listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Wang Ta had finished . " You know why you 're often unhappy ? " he finally said . " You do n't tell enough . You shut everything within yourself and let it torture you unnecessarily for weeks and months . You should have told me of this secret long ago . " " I almost did in a letter . But I changed my mind . Confucius said , Family ugliness should not be exposed . ' I regard it as an ugly part of my life . Miss Chao and I used to go to Vessurro and chat . Now each time I pass that place , it reminds me of her and I feel like a murderer . " " I 'm going to tell you another story . But let me take you to another place first , " Chang said , turning his back . " It 's a ghostly place and it provides the right atmosphere . " They went back to Jackson and turned into a dark little alley where Wang Ta had never been before . It was a narrow cleft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all shut and there was not a soul in the alley . " They say the hatchet men used to fight tong wars here , " Chang said . " Many mystery novelists have used this place as the background for their murder scenes , but so far I have n't discovered any secret tunnels as some of them so vividly described in their books . " He walked into a round door about eight feet in diameter . Wang Ta followed . An old red-lacquered ricksha was parked in a corner in the passageway . " They say this place was once the headquarters of a famous underground gang . The door was made of steel ; the walls were dungeon-thick . Now this place is a cocktail bar ; this new moon-door , which has no door at all , symbolizes peace . I used to come here to spend a quiet evening all by myself . It reminds me of my home in the village . My grandfather 's house vaguely resembles this building , with a moon-door leading to the bamboo garden . Come in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has a lot to tell about this historical alley . " They came in a second door and entered the dark templelike bar , with three large lanterns hanging from the red-lacquered ceiling . In the wall facing the bar was an altar of an unknown gilded god ; flanking the god were shelves of antique vases and pottery . On either side of the bar was a glittering collection of snuff bottles of different shapes and colors . " Sit down , " Chang said , indicating a round table beside the god . " Do n't be afraid of the gilded gentleman . He might be one of the booze barons ' of the Chinese mythology . " Wang Ta sat down in a rattan chair and glanced at the snuff bottles of silver and amber , at the shiny mother-of-pearl on vermilion Soochow lacquer , displayed along the walls like items in a museum . " The owner is not here tonight , " Chang said , bringing two bottles of beer to the table from the bar . " You know why I like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to play the jukebox , so we can talk without shouting . And here is self-service , no waitress comes every five minutes to look at your empty glass . " He sat down and poured the beer . " Do you still feel like a mur-derer ? " " In a way , yes , " Wang Ta said . " I think I 'll always feel like one .  | I still remember that night I read the news about Miss Chao 's death . I was drinking coffee in a restaurant after a good movie . I was in an excellent frame of mind . But when I finished reading the news , I suddenly became a fugitive . The paper said , The police are uncertain whether she had been robbed and murdered .. : I almost had a good mind to call up the police and tell them I was the murderer . " " I think this is the root of your trouble , " Chang said after swallowing a mouthful of beer . " Your intention of going back to Mainland China has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you another story . It 's about myself . Do you want to hear it ? " " Go ahead . " " Years ago I had a girl friend in San Francisco . It 's an ugly story , so I do n't have to tell you her name . She was friendly , attractive and gay . ' We went out a lot ; I met all of her girl friends . We had a wonderful time together . Every Sunday evening she gave a soft-drink party in her apartment . I dated her for almost a year , but never on Saturday . On Saturday she was always busy , washing , ironing , cleaning the house and so forth and so forth . One Saturday morning she called me . This was quite a surprise . She wanted me to take her and her girl friend for a ride in the country . Her girl friend was a patient at the Children 's Hospital , suffering a mild case of polio . I was delighted . I even canceled another engagement to go out with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . She was so gay , quick with a joke . " He paused , emptied his bottle into his glass and went on . " We drove to Half Moon Bay . We joked and talked and sang . On our way back , my girl friend suddenly became nervous . She repeatedly told me to step on the gas . It was getting late . I asked her why she was so anxious to get home . She said she had a lot of things to do , washing , ironing , cleaning the house and so forth . But I suspected she had a date . That was Saturday . She could n't fool me . Suddenly I was terribly jealous . " Chang took a drink , wiped his mouth and continued , " So , I purposely slowed down the car . My girl was furious . She began to say nasty things . That added gasoline to the fire , When entering  | San Francisco , I made a wrong turn and got lost . I drove around and around pretending that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to stop the car and let her out . She wanted to take a bus home . She wanted to get home so anxiously that she even ignored her girl friend , the polio case . I insisted that she should see her girl friend back to the hospital first . She was so furious that she beat me , pinched my ear and even grabbed the steering wheel to force me to stop . I almost smashed the car into a truck . That frightened her and finally she let the steering wheel alone ; she clenched her hands so tight that her knuckles became white ; she fidgeted beside me , growling and mumbling threats . In the meantime I was hopelessly lost in the intricate city of San Francisco . " Chang lighted a cigarette and blew out the smoke reminiscently . " You know , " he went on , " her clenched fists really bothered me . They reminded me of a nymphomaniac in heat described by Somerset Maugham in one of his novels . She must be anticipating a great evening with her man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me . But the fire burning in her was more furious . She saw a yellow cab and she screamed . I quickly pulled the car to the curb and let her off . Of all women 's weapons , including fingernails and teeth , screaming is the most dreadful . As an alien in this country , I did n't want to get myself into any record in which a woman 's scream is involved . So I let her go and drove her friend back to the hospital . But , the green horns on my head were growing . " After I returned the sick girl to her nurse , I took a short cut and sped to my girl friend 's house . I parked the car in front of it and watched . It was already dark . The venetian blinds were down in her living room , but there was light inside , so I knew she had returned . I waited for about twenty minutes , wondering what she was doing inside . Suddenly a car appeared and slowed down , apparently looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about three minutes a man appeared , wearing a spring coat and hat . I could n't see clearly how he looked . He went up the steps and rang my girl friend 's doorbell . The door was flung open and immediately  | it swallowed the man up . I sat in my car and watched the window and let my imagination torture me . And it did n't take much imagination to tell what was going on . Some ten minutes later the light was out . " Chang took a deep drink from his glass , puffed on his cigarette and blew out the smoke heavily . " That week I was a dead man , " he went on . " I was a walking corpse  --  eating , breathing , but dead in , side . Before the week was over I revived . And because I was a devil , I wanted to do something destructive . It was Saturday . I walked into a National Dollar Store and did something I would never have the courage to do again . I walked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's underwear . I did n't look at her face . Although a devil I was still a bit embarrassed . She asked what size and I said any size . She must have thought I was someone just out of a mental hospital from the back door . Nevertheless she sold me a pair of medium-sized pink drawers . They were about right . I wrapped them up in a scarf which my girl friend had left in my car last week , then I went home and waited for my big show . " Well , evening came . Ten minutes before seven I drove to my girl friend 's house . I parked the car half a block away and waited . Her lover was late . He did n't show up until eight that Saturday . When he was about to go up the steps , I rushed to him . Are you visiting Miss So and So ? ' I asked . He looked at me and hesitated . Yes , why ? ' he asked . She forgot something in my apartment last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm on my way to catch a plane , I wo n't have time to see her . And please tell her I wo n't be in tomorrow . Thanks a lot . ' When I finished my line , I rushed to my car and drove away fast . I do n't know what happened . After that I did n't care any more . A gentleman might not try to find out what was in that scarf . But that man did n't look like a gentleman to me . He was the sneaky type . Might be a married man from out of town . Anyway , I tossed my bomb ; whether the bomb exploded or not , I did n't know . " " It was a dirty joke you played on that girl , " Wang Ta said . " A cruel joke , " Chang said . " She must have cared for that man  | a great deal , you know . Well , I was a fool . I thought I really loved her . As Maupassanthas said , if a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he becomes silly and brutal at the same time . I was brutal , I became destructive , like a maniac . That girl was just friendly to me . She never said she loved me , and yet I took it for granted that she was mine . And I played that stupid joke on her . ' When I think of it now , I really want to deliver a vicious kick in my own pants . I think Miss Helen Chao made exactly the same mistake . She became destructive ; the only difference is that she destroyed herself . " " Our case is different , " Wang Ta said . " I had an illicit relationship with her . " " I have not yet met a man who , under the influence of alcohol , could resist the seduction of a woman , " Chang said , chopping the table with the edge of his hand to emphasize every word . " You know , I think she actually was a victim of this peculiar situation ? the shortage of Chinese women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or overestimated her own value . Consequently she was only interested in customers like you , young , handsome , well-educated and so forth and so forth . And she took it for granted that you should marry her . She simply could n't face the fact that you did n't love her . Just as I did n't face the fact that my girl was in love with some other man , and that for some reason or other she had to keep it a secret , possibly pending the man 's divorce from his wife . I think a lot of destruction has been done in this world for the sole reason that so many of us are afraid of facing facts . Now I begin to sound like a missionary . Do you want another beer ? " " No . Beer makes me dizzy . " " Let 's take a walk on Grant Avenue , " Chang said . " Grant Avenue after dark is quite a sight . I hope someday I 'll have the time to write a book , a book packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Dark . I bet I can write such a book , since I 've tossed my Ph.D . degree into the gutter . " He finished his beer and rose . " Let 's go . "  | They came out of the alley and walked toward Grant Avenue through Washington Street . Before they reached Grant they heard a shot . " Well , " Wang Ta said , laughing , " it seems that someone is writing the first chapter of your book now . " " That 's a firecracker , " Chang said . " Do you realize that it 's only two weeks away from the Chinese New Year ? " Wang Ta looked at the full moon in the cloudless sky . " The middle of January . That 's right . In two weeks , the Year of the Horse will be here . Will you come ? " " I never miss the Chinese New Year in San Francisco . I love the parade , the firecrackers , the dragon , the New Year dance , the gambling and so forth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year you really get some Chinese spirit here  --  the ma ma fu fu spirit . Even the police are somewhat indulgent , and tend to relax some of the restrictions . Take parking , for instance , you can park your car right under a NO PARKING AT ANY TIME sign without getting a ticket . And firecrackers . The law has banned firecrackers ; but during the Chinese New Year the law closes one eye and says , It 's illegal to sell and buy firecrackers . ' It does n't say anything about firing firecrackers . So everybody tosses firecrackers around . That 's the good old ma ma fu fu spirit , and the city has really grasped it ... " As they were talking and walking south on Grant , they were startled by two more shots . A lot of people stopped and turned in the direction from which the shots came . Suddenly a man dashed out of Sacramento Street and ran up the hill toward Powell on the west side . Presently two other men dashed past Grant , one of them firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop . Chang and Wang Ta quickened ' their steps ; when they reached Sacramento a police car roared by , its siren screaming . " That 's not firecrackers , " Wang Ta said . " That 's the first chapter of your Chinatown After Dark ! " " Look , " Chang said . He quickly turned east on Sacramento . About a block down there was an ambulance , its red light blinking . A small crowd was nearby , talking and gesticulating . Wang  | Ta and Chang hurried to the scene , and saw a man being carried into the ambulance . " O.K. let 's go , " a policeman said , opening his patrol car parked beside the ambulance . Two men helped a whining woman into the car . " I 'll be darned , " Chang said in English . " Is n't that Miss Tung ? " " That 's Linda Tung all right , " Wang Ta said . " Who else is an eyewitness ? " the policeman asked . " We 'll go with you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light-blue evening dress into the car with him . The ambulance started and turned north on Kearny . The police car followed . Soon their wailing sirens faded in the distance . " What has happened ? " Chang asked an onlooker . The man shrugged his shoulders . " Somebody shot somebody for a girl , " he said . " You 'll read about it in the papers . The crowd began to disperse . " Another case of destruction , " Chang said . " That 's what you get by mixing up with a girl like Linda Tung . " They started back for Grant , and Chang added , " It could have been you , you know . " Wang Ta was quiet for a moment . " Which one ? " he finally asked , refusing to be depressed by the scene , " the escaped shooter or the one in the ambulance ? " " The one in the ambulance , naturally , " Chang said . " You know , you are probably the rare type of man who does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy , that 's all . " " I 'm not so sure of that , " Wang Ta said . " Sometimes I really want to explode and shoot somebody . Where shall we go next ? " " The shooting spoiled the evening , " Chang said . " I think I 'll just go to a hotel and go to bed . I ca n't look at blood and I hate violence . " " And yet you want to write a book called Chinatown After Dark , " Wang Ta said . " I want to write about its romance , its uniqueness , its quaintness and serenity . Brutality only distorts the picture of Chinatown . I think this shooting is again a result of this peculiar situation ?  | not enough women to go around . In Shanghai , girls like Linda Tung are a dime a dozen , to use an American expression . Nobody would lift a finger for her , let alone shoot . " " It seems to me you blame everything on the scarcity of women . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow like you should have married a long time ago and stayed home enjoying your three children . And yet here you are , pacing the street at this ungodly hour and lamenting your unhappiness . You know , the more I think of this situation , the more I believe it has caused all the tragedies . in Chinatown . Believe it or not , Helen Chao was killed by a doublebarreled gun . " Wang Ta looked at him and scowled . " What do you mean ? " he asked . " First barrel , she overestimated herself because of this peculiar situation , as I said before ; second barrel , because of this situation a good-looking man like you had to fool around with an ugly duckling like Helen Chao " " Let 's change the subject , " Wang Ta interrupted hastily . " We 've finished talking about her . " " I 'm going to a hotel , " Chang said . " The shooting spoiled my mood . I do n't even want to talk now . " After Wang Ta walked Chang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Stockton Street . It was a pretty long walk . He reviewed what Chang had said and found there was some horse sense in his cynicism . It was unusual to find a person who was both cynical and optimistic . Undoubtedly Chang was such a . r strange character . Perhaps his attitude was a special product of this peculiar situation ; perhaps it was a'correct attitude , or even the only attitude a Chinese refugee should take in dealing with this situation , if he wanted to be moderately happy . When he reached home he felt somewhat better , as though he had found a temporary relief for a painful disease .  | For convenience in writing checks , Old Master Wang had been learning English . Each day he would practice writing " one , two , three . . . " up to a hundred for an hour or so with the same enthusiasm and precision that he practiced calligraphy . Madam Tang had bought him a ball-point pen , which he held a bit awkwardly like an American holding a pair of chopsticks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn how to write the numbers up to ten thousand , which was the amount of money he intended to keep in his checking account constantly . He found it a great pleasure writing checks ; it seemed to give him great authority and make him feel important ; besides , it was gratifying to know that the recipient of the check and the people in the bank had to read his writing . It was a quiet evening . After a good dinner by himself , and having enjoyed his coughing , he practiced writing until his fingers were seized with cramps . He put his pen aside , massaged his fingers and cracked them , and in the meantime enjoyed looking at the result of his labor on the fine bond paper , with a chuckle . What would his wife think of his newly acquired ability , had she been alive ? he thought . She had always admired his calligraphy . Now this strange language was really something for her to admire ; he wondered whether his writing of it lacked strength and character . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language , he thought , he would write a couplet scroll in English and see how it looked on the wall . It was enough writing for today . He put his writing away and called Liu Ma to bring his ginseng soup and the Chinese newspapers . Liu Ma came in promptly as if she had been waiting outside his door . Her fat face was red with excitement and her thin lips were tightly pursed as though she were holding something explosive in  | her mouth and ready to release it . " Old Master , " she said , laying the newspapers on the desk in front of Wang Chi-yang , " please read this piece of news with this picture printed here . " It was a girl 's picture , with a duck-egg-shaped face and long dark wavy hair and earrings resembling a seven-tiered pagoda . Another she-devil , Wang Chi-yang thought , and with a slight scowl he read the news . " Chinatown Gun Battle , " the headline said . " Last night two men quarreled over a woman and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divorcee , went to a dance at a businessman 's club on Sacramento Street with a man who she claimed was her brother . While dancing cheek to cheek with her brother , ' Miss Tung ignored one of her ex-boy friends who greeted her . The ex-boy friend , Dick Wei , a seaman , patted her on her bare shoulder and asked her whether she had heard his greeting . Miss Tung opened her eyes and fluttered her eyelashes . Wei , not satisfied with the cold reception , touched her shoulder again and announced his desire to cut in . A quarrel ensued . Her partner , who was later identified as George Sun , an insurance salesman , invited Wei to step out . Both men went out of the club . While Sun was taking his coat off Wei simplified the whole matter by pulling a gun on his rival . Sun , in a moment of unusual bravery , defied the gun and lunged at Wei and immediately received a bullet in his stomach . Wei was arrested on Powell Street and booked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent to Tung Hwa Hospital where his condition was reported as serious . " The moment Old Master Wang finished the news , he looked up and said , " The news of a she-devil . I usually do not waste my time reading this type of nonsense . Why do you want me to read it ? " Without a word Liu Ma dug out a picture from her pocket and laid it in front of her master . Wang Chi-yang looked at it with a deep scowl . " This is the picture of this she-devil . Where did you get it ? " " In Young Master Wang Ta 's room , " Liu Ma said importantly . " I found it in his desk drawer . " " Tell the young master to come immediately . "  | " He is out . He went out after dinner . " " The incorrigible dog , " Wang Chi-yang mumbled angrily . He tossed the picture on the table and asked , " Does he go out every night ? " " I do not know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time I pass his room in the evening , it has no light . " " Has he brought bad women to this house ? " " I do not know , " Liu Ma said . Then she leaned forward and confided , " Liu Lung told me he heard noises one night . I shall ask him what kind of noises he heard . " " Where is Young Master Wang San ? " Wang Chi-yang asked . " Where is everybody tonight ? " " Young Master Wang San went to see a motion picture with Madam Tang . They have not returned yet . The cook has a visitor ... " " I am not interested in the cook , " Wang Chi-yang interrupted . " Ask Madam Tang to see me when she comes in . And take this ginseng soup away . I do not want any tonight . " " Do you want me to beat your shoulders , Old Master ? " " No ! " After Liu Ma had left , Wang Chi-yang walked around in his room , hating Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did n't know how . If he cut down his monthly allowance , people would think him stingy , and the boy could get the money from his aunt ; if he scolded him , his words would go in one ear and promptly come out of the other . And he could n't beat a grownup man 's palm with the bamboo stick with which he used to discipline Wang San . Suddenly he missed his late wife and felt somewhat helpless without her . She had been a good woman , a fine disciplinarian , always keeping the house in good order . After she had died , everything seemed to go wrong . The sons became wild and disobedient , the servants became lazy and untrustworthy , even the whole Chinese nation went to communism . Now this new house , which was no larger than the old house in China , seemed empty and forlorn , and the warmth of a home was gone forever . He went to the living room , which was the only room com-  | parable to the middle hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to walk in the middle hall in the old house and smoke his water pipe on the kang , which was as wide as a double bed and had a low tea-table placed in the center , with paper spills , watermelon seeds , tea and sweetmeats within his easy reach . On each side of the tea-table was an embroidered pillow made by his wife , and he used to take a nap on the kang after each meal . There were the god of longevity with his enormous forehead and long earlobes , the plates heaped with fresh fruits , the gold clock , the incense burner , the moon-window looking out on his bamboo garden . . . . What did he have in the living room of this foreign house ? Nothing but straight-backed chairs . The room had a deserted look that was almost ghostly . He quickly returned to his bedroom , took out a piece of paper and started listing the things he must buy . He must redecorate the living room for the Year of the Horse , which was approaching ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with the old spirit and warmth of the old house created by his late wife ... . Around ten o'clock Madam Tang came into his room . " Liu Ma told me that you wanted to see me , " she said , sitting in one of the rattan chairs . " Is there anything wrong ? " Wang Chi-yang was having a spasm of coughing . " Have you read the Chinese newspapers ? " he asked , clearing his throat and groaning . " Yes , I have , " Madam Tang said , then she looked at him , narrowing her eyes with a scowl . " Your coughing is getting worse . You should go to see a Western doctor if the herb doctor can not cure it . You should do something about it ... " " At this moment I am not worrying - about my cough , " Wang Chi-yang interrupted . " My cough will be better if my sons are not busy ruining themselves . The newspapers said a man killed another man for an evil woman ; have you read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madam Tang said . " I know him . He is in the hospital . This type of thing happens frequently in foreign society , but this is the first case in Chinatown in fifteen years . " " Do you know Wang Ta is involved with this evil woman ? "  | Madam Tang looked shocked . " No , I did not know , " she said . " Did the policeman come ? " " No , but Liu Ma found a photograph of this woman in Wang . Ta 's desk drawer . " Madam Tang stared at her brother-in-law for a moment and then shook her head despairingly . " My sister 's husband , having her picture does not mean that Wang Ta is involved with her . For a moment you frightened me unnecessarily . This woman wants to be a singing star of some kind , she has been passing her photographs around like a bill-passer on a street corner . I do not believe that Wang Ta would associate with a woman like her . She is an exdancing girl who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Wang Ta associated with that pockmarked woman whose corpse was found in the ocean , " Wang Chi-yang said . " Why is it that he always has something to do with a woman who is either involved in a killing or dies a violent death ? " After a quick glance at the door , Madam Tang leaned forward and warned , " My sister 's husband , I hope that nobody had overheard you . You talk as if Wang Ta were a gangster chief who specializes in killing women . Miss Chao committed suicide . The foreign newspapers said that the police have confirmed it . Do not ever talk like this again ! " " My wife 's sister , " Wang Chi-yang said after a sigh , " Wang Ta was born in the Year of the Sheep . He should be a man of peaceful nature . But now I begin to suspect there is an evil spirit in this house that has been leading him astray , leading him to people involved in blood and death ... " " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Wang ignored her ; he rose to his feet , paced the floor and went on . " The old spirit created by your sister is gone . The new house is never like the old . Perhaps that is why the evil spirit invaded this house . Today I made a decision . I intend to redecorate the living room like the middle hall in the old house ; everything will be rearranged just as it was by your sister in the old house . Do you know where I can buy a kang in Chinatown ? "  | " I know a merchant who might have a kang for sale , " Madam Tang said , her voice softened . " You are right , my sister 's husband . Since my sister died , things are not the same any more . Do you still have her gold clock ? " " Yes , I have brought it to America with me . And I also have the portrait of the god of longevity . All I need is the kang . With the old atmosphere restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be different . " " It will be , " Madam Tang said . " Nothing evil would have happened if you had remembered my sister sooner . Perhaps you would not even cough so badly . I am glad that you realize it now . " After Madam Tang had left to look for a kang in Chinatown , Wang Chi-yang opened another of his locked trunks and took out the portrait of the god of longevity and the gold clock , which his wife had treasured more than anything else in the old house . Both items , in his opinion , would have the power to ward off any evil spirit in the middle hall , the passageway to all rooms . Then he prepared his best ink on his large ink slab and wrote a few couplet scrolls with his largest brush . The poems were the same as the ones written originally in the scrolls in the old house . With everything prepared , he called Liu Ma into his room and told her of his intentions . The next day Liu Ma and Liu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A black-lacquered teakwood kang with its low tea-table arrived in the afternoon . It was placed against the wall facing the entrance . Flanking the kang were the couplet scrolls . The portrait of the god of longevity was hung above a teakwood table against the wall on the right , with an incense bowl and two plates of peaches arranged in a triangle on the table as offerings . The gold clock was placed in front of the incense bowl . According to the old arrangement all these would have been on the left side , but in this foreign house there was a fireplace in the left wall which , in Old Master Wang 's opinion , served no purpose other than provide the evil spirits with another entrance . So he decided that the god of longevity should be hung on the opposite wall so that the celestial member could keep  | an eye on the " hole in the wall . " Chairs and ebony teastands filled the vacant spots along the walls , with a few pots of orchids placed in the corners of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liu Ma had brought from the old house . Liu Ma had brought everything movable except the half-dozen brass cuspidors . Madam Tang said it was hard to buy cuspidors in this country , so the room would have to do without them . In the meantime the cook was busy cleaning his kitchen for the New Year . He washed everything and scrubbed the floor . He took down the paper-and-cloth image of Tsao Wang , the kitchen god that had hung all year above the stove ; he smeared the god 's wide mouth with honey and burned him so that he would ascend to heaven to report the family conduct with sweet words . Then he pasted a new image above the stove . Something had bothered him for years ; the foreign kitchen had no cockroaches , the servants of the kitchen god . In the Year of the Horse something must be done about it . He reported this to Old Master Wang and the old master in turn told it to Madam Tang , asking for her help . Madam Tang hated cockroaches , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few of them from the cook at any of the daily newspapers , which had the oldest kitchens in Chinatown . On the twenty-ninth of the twelfth moon the house of Wang was thoroughly cleaned . Two large cockroaches had been let loose in the kitchen ; smoked pork and guts were hung on the kitchen wall to indicate the prosperity of the house ; two live fish were swimming in a tub and a fat hen was cackling under the cutting board , one of her feet tied to the kitchen table . Sea slugs , bird's-nest , shark's-fin and other dried delicacies were being soaked in fresh water in huge bowls . The cook was sharpening his kitchen knife , ready to prepare the New Year dinner with all his skill and ability . Liu Ma and Liu Lung brought out their best clothes from the bottom of their trunks , washed all their old clothes and sunned their beddings . Old Master Wang sent for a Cantonese barber and every male in the house had his hair cut , and the barber received his pay wrapped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared more than a dozen red packages of money , some containing five dollars and some containing ten . He was to distribute the good-luck money among his servants and his sons and the children of friends who might drop in to wish him a Happy New Year . On the thirtieth everything was prepared . The main event of the day was the New Year 's Eve dinner . In China it would have been a banquet of at least twenty tables ; guests andrelatiyes would play mah-jongg and gamble until dawn , when a long string of firecrackers would be set off at the front gate to herald the arrival of the New Year . In this country the Wangs did n't have any relatives except Madam Tang , so the banquet was only a " one table " affair . But it was an elaborate table , with all the delicacies cooked in chicken broth , decorated with mushrooms and bamboo shoots cut into flowers . The fifteen-course dinner contained two soups and the cook 's specialty  --  the eight-treasure rice , a sweet dish that resembled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with red dates , lotus seeds and sweetmeats of assorted colors buried in the rice in an intricate design . At the New Year dinner table everybody forgot his sorrows and worries . Old Master Wang , sitting on the noblest seat facing the entrance , actually smiled , but not as much as to lose his dignity . Madam Tang , taking the secondary seat on his right , kept heaping food in her nephews ' bowls . Wang Ta ate slowly and sparingly and grinned occasionally to show that he was following the tradition , ready to start the coming New Year with a clean body and a clean conscience . Wang San , having seen a Robin Hood picture the previous night , was eating an enormous chicken leg with his hand , a gesture at table that would ordinarily have irritated the elders , but today nobody was to be irritated , Wang San knew it and he was taking full advantage of it . " I hope that every one of you have cleared all your debts , " Wang Chi-yang addressed his sons benevolently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important that Wang Chi-yang had paid all his household bills in advance . Wang San , again taking advan-  | tage of the situation , declared that he had ordered a bicycle and two baseball bats . " Why two baseball bats ? " Madam Tang asked . " Everyone at the school has a spare one , my aunt , " Wang San said . Old Master Wang had no idea what a baseball bat was and he was n't too interested in finding out . " How much do all these items cost ? " he asked . " Seventy-five dollars , " Wang San said . " Give your aunt the merchant 's address and we shall send him a check for that amount , " Wang Chi-yang said . Wang San thanked his father and suddenly he finished his dinner . He sneaked out of the house to order the bicycle and baseball bats , regretting that he had n't said a hundred dollars . " How about you , Wang Ta ? " Madam Tang asked . " I have no debt , " Wang Ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty dollars , my aunt . But I shall not be able to pay you back this year . " " I shall give your aunt a check for that amount , " Wang Chiyang said hastily . " Thank you , father , " Wang Ta said . " If you and Aunt Tang do not mind , I would like to pay this debt myself ... " Wang Chi-yang suddenly looked up at his son as if displeased . " With what are you going to pay ... " " Ahem , ahem , " Madam Tang coughed . " How about your car , Wang Ta ? Does it still run ? " " Yes , it still runs , " Wang Ta said . " It is a good car . " They looked at each other and forgot about money matters ; they talked on pleasant subjects and expressed agreeable opinions which left no room for argument . ' When they finished dinner the servants sat at the table and continued the banquet until half the food was devoured . It was a successful New Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication of a good , prosperous New Year . Next morning the whole house was awakened by a fifteen-foot-  | long string of firecrackers set off by Liu Lung at the front gate to welcome the Year of the Horse . In the middle hall incense sticks were lighted and offerings of food and fruits were made to the ancestors under the old master 's supervision . At ten o'clock , after an elaborate breakfast of porridge and many cold dishes of smoked meat and guts of pork and fowl , the congratulatory ceremony began . Madam Tang , who had come early , bowed to Old Master Wang , who returned the bow politely with his hands clasped in front of him , smiling slightly . Then Wang Ta and Wang San gave each of the elders three bows , and the elders returned the salutation by nodding their heads . When this was over , both father and aunt dug out some red packages from the pockets of their new satin gowns and handed them to Wang Ta and Wang San , who accepted the money with pretended modesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't settle the ceremony with bows . They insisted that Old Master Wang and Madam Tang sit down in two ancestral chairs which Liu Lung had placed in the middle of the hall , facing the entrance . After they were seated , the servants , headed by the cook , kowtowed to them one by one . Old Master Wang was pleased . The servants were good and loyal ; they would n't change the old habit even in a foreign land . I-le accepted the kowtows smiling , waving his hand and saying , " Do n't dirty your clothes , do n't dirty your clothes . " Madam Tang sat in her chair and protested like a sixteen-yearold girl being pestered by some men whom she did n't dislike . She turned her head away , half-smiling and half-scowling , fluttered one of her hands and kept saying , " Go away , that 's enough . Go away ! " Having accepted the servants ' kowtows , Old Master Wang and Madam Tang once more dug their hands into their pockets . Each of them brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants , who protested , " No , no , you are too kind , Old Master , Madam Tang ; please do n't give us the money , we do n't deserve it ! " And they pocketed the money eagerly , still protesting . " Wang Ta , Wang San , " Madam Tang said to her nephews ,  | " today I am giving a New Year dinner at Hung Wa Low Restaurant . You two shall go there at six o'clock . Do not be late , or we shall miss the New Year parade on Grant Avenue at eight thirty , do you hear ? " " Yes , my aunt , " Wang San said , eager to go out . The red packages containing ten dollars each were getting restless in his pocket . " I shall be there , my aunt . " Then he added in English , " Oh , brother , New Year parade ! May I go now ? " " You can go , " Madam Tang said . Wang Ta also started for the door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aunt Tang , " he said . " I shall be at the restaurant on time . " After the sons were gone and the servants had withdrawn to their quarters , Wang Chi-yang heaved a sigh and said to his wife 's sister , " I am glad that at least one son has not forgotten his Chinese and still has some manners . " " Wang San has reached a difficult age , " Madam Tang said . " I shall not worry too much about him . He will know better when he reaches Wang Ta 's age . " " Wang Ta is approaching thirty , " Wang Chi-yang said . " According to Confucius , a man nearing thirty should have established himself . " " Confucius lived more than four thousand years ago , " Madam Tang said . " The standard is different now . In this modern world there are men and women who are over forty and still going to school ... " " Yes , yes , " Wang Chi-yang said hastily , " But Wang Ta is still single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot to tell you , my wife 's sister , I have negotiated a wife for him through a go-between in Hong Kong at the recommendation of an herb doctor . Day before yesterday I received the girl 's picture . She is not badlooking , and was born in the Year of the Rabbitt . I shall not tell Wang Ta of the arrangement until I have your opinion of the girl . " He took a small photo from his pocket and handed it to Madam Tang , who looked at it for a moment , her face expressionless .  | " What do you think of her ? " " I like the face , " Madam Tang said . " How about her limbs and weight ? Do you have a complete physical description of her ? " " No physical defects , " Wang Chi-yang said . " That is guaranteed . She is slightly plump , as indicated by her face . That is desirable , since plumpness is a sign of fertility . " Madam Tang looked at the picture for another moment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has level eyes and thick lips , an indication of honesty . How is her background ? " " She is the daughter of a schoolteacher who died in the Hong Kong fire three years ago . " Madam Tang nodded her head . " I shall keep the picture and ask a noted physiognomist to give it a careful analysis . If she becomes Wang Ta 's wife , she will one day share my properties , and I must be assured of her virtues . " " You are right , my wife 's sister , " Wang Chi-yang said . " But right now we have a problem . If the girl is as good as the go-between has guaranteed , how shall we get her over to this country ? The herb doctor says if Wang Ta is not a citizen of this country , it poses a great problem . " " I shall talk to Miss Shaw about it , " Madam Tang said . " Miss Shaw is my citizenship teacher . We shall have her advice . You will meet her tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She looked at the picture again , then with a nod of her head she quickly put it into her handbag . " I like the girl , " she added casually , trying to hide her excitement . " I hope the picture is a recent one . A restaurant owner in Chinatown got a picture bride from Hong Kong who cheated by fifteen years . " " I do not believe this one will cheat , " Wang Chi-yang said . " The picture looks new , and the go-between is reputable , recommended by an herb doctor who has become my close friend . " " I would like to meet this herb doctor , " Madam Tang said . " Let us invite him to my New Year banquet . Please write an invitation and tell Liu Lung to deliver it . As your close friend , he might drop in for a cup of wine even if he has other engagements . "  | Wang Chi-yang agreed with her . He hurried to his room to write the invitation , while Madam Tang walked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was getting more excited as she saw the possibility of Wang Ta 's marriage to a girl whose innocent looks had met her approval . Being childless herself , she was anxious to see her sister 's family grow . And since her money was eventually going to fertilize this family tree , she felt it was part of her responsibility to see that no undesirable weeds and creepers become entangled with the tree and absorb its fertilizer . When she thought of it she suddenly became very busy and important . " Liu Lung , Liu Ma , " she called . " Come here , all of you , and tell the cook to come , too ! " When the servants gathered in the middle hall , she fished out a twenty-dollar bill from her purse and handed it to Liu Ma . " Today I am giving a banquet at a restaurant . There will be no more work for you today . You three can also eat at a restaurant and then go watch the parade . Here is some money for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad smile . She thanked Madam Tang and ordered her husband and the cook to extend their thanks too . " My sister 's husband , have you finished writing the invitation ? " Old Master Wang hurried out of his room with the invitation , which Madam Tang took and hastily handed to Liu Lung . " Deliver this immediately . Tell the herb doctor to be sure to honor us with his presence . " " Enh ? " " Oh , I am busy , " she said , snatching the invitation from the deaf servant 's hand and handing it to the cook . " Lao Fong , you go and deliver it . The address is on the envelope . My sister 's husband , I shall see you at Hung Wa Low at six . " " Are you going so soon ? " Wang Chi-yang asked . Madam Tang wanted to see the physiognomist and have the girl 's face analyzed immediately , but she did n't want to look too anxious .  | " Yes , " she said . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang smiled . He sat down on the kang and enjoyed another spasm of coughing . 3 The ear-rending firecrackers exploded throughout Chinatown , which has an unofficial boundary starting from Kearny at the east to Larkin , nine blocks to the west , and from Bush at the south to Broadway , with " colonies " extended to North Beach , the Italian section . But it was on Grant Avenue and Stockton Street , the business center of Chinatown , that the firecrackers really roared on New Year 's day . From six o'clock on in the morning Grant Avenue smelled of powder , food , and wine . Many shops were closed , but there were music and laughter floating on the gentle breeze from San Francisco Bay . The Stars and Stripes , the red and blue and bright sun flag of Nationalist China , fluttered among colorful banners and lanterns . The sidewalks became a flower mart ; pink and white azaleas , camellias , narcissus , orchid plants , water lilies , plum and peach blossoms were everywhere , their earthen pots wrapped up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen-year-old daughter , May Li , walked on Grant Avenue with their meager luggage carried on their  | backs , their faces turning in all directions , fascinated . They had just arrived in San Francisco from Los Angeles by Greyhound bus . Old Man Li carried in his bosom two important items : a letter of introduction , and his great ambition to open the only Peking restaurant in San Francisco 's Chinatown . He and his daughter had been in this country for three months : they had come with General White , a retired army general who had lived in China for more than twenty years , and would have died there , as he had hoped , if the Communists had not driven him out . Li had followed the general from China to Formosa , and eventually to Los Angeles , where the general had established his new home . When the general had died at the venerable age of seventy-eight , Li was so broken-hearted that for three weeks he fought the desire to follow him further . Li had regarded the general more as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed him fifteen years ago when Li wassinging flowcr.songs with his wife at the famed Heavenly Bridge in Peking and running a small restaurant at night . The general had frequented the open-air market shopping antiques and eating Li 's hot bread with sesame oil and eggs fried with black fungus ; he liked the dish so much that he finally hired Li to cook for him at an eye-popping salary of ten U.S. dollars a month , almost three times as much as the monthly profit of the small restaurant . During his fifteen years ' association with General White , Li had enjoyed a comfortable life , although his wife , always uncomfortable if not working , had died of hard work . Now he was in the largest Chinatown in America , tired but excited , ready to go back to his old business . He halted at the corner of Grant and Pine and wiped the perspiration on his forehead with a forefinger . " Shew , we have walked a distance of five li from the bus station , " he said in Mandarin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , " the girl said . She was dressed in a Chinese gown of light blue and wearing a pigtail wound round her head , her pretty face without make-up glowing with health . " Shall we go visit Mr. Poon now , father ? "  | " Oh , do not be foolish . Nobody visits people so early . This is New Year 's day , people sleep in the morning with a full stomach of food and wine and do not wish to be disturbed . We shall have our breakfast and rest our legs for a while . " He wiped his forehead once more and looked around . " Here is a teahouse , father , " May Li said , pointing at a red signboard saying " Lotus Room . " " Good , " Old Man Li said . When he looked at the stairway he frowned . " No , May Li , I shall not climb this with my luggage on my back . " " Let me carry it up for you , father , " May Li said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I can carry a lot more . " She held her father 's canvas bag until Li finally yielded it to her , shaking his head . " You are just like your mother , May Li . Forty years ago when she was your age she could carry a hundred catties of flour and walk seventy li a day . She was strong as a cow , and just as amiable ... " " What shall we eat , father ? " May Li asked . " We shall see , " Old Man Li said , trudging up the stairway . " We shall have some New Year dishes . But we must be careful in our selection . The owner of this place might be greedy , otherwise he would not have built a restaurant upstairs . He knows that people will eat more after this climbing , shew ! " When he reached the top of the stairs he promptly changed his opinion of the owner . The spacious dining hall with red-lacquered lattice windows was clean and impressive , almost filled with customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . The smiling manager greeted them and directed them to a vacant table near one of the windows and handed them two copies of the menu with special New Year dishes attached to them . Old Man Li held the menu tensely , swallowing and resisting , his eyes roving among the expensive items . He wanted to eat everything , but he felt his economical nature held him back like an iron chain restraining a dog . He quickly closed the menu and rubbed his neck . " May Li , I shall let you order . "  | " Shall we eat some New Year dishes ? " she asked . Old Man Li swallowed . " Sure , sure . But it is close to lunch time now . We shall not eat too much . " May Li ordered a dollar 's worth of chow mein and a New Year dish  --  the taro pudding . When the food came , Old Man Li picked one of the three puddings with his fingers and shoved the rest toward May Li . " It is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , too , father , " May Li said , shoving the dish back . " You eat it , " Old Man Li said , trying to keep his eyes off the pudding . " My stomach is getting withered ; it does not need much food now . A few mouthfuls of social drinks will satisfy it . " He fished out a flask from a pocket and took a drink from it . " Shew , it is good . Eat your pudding , May Li . Do n't wait until it is cold . " While May Li was eating the taro pudding sparingly , Old Man Li poured tea and served the chow mein . " Are you happy in America , May Li ? " he asked . " Yes , father . " " That is good , that is good . Do you know what I am going to do in America besides opening the best Peking restaurant ? I am going to find a fashionable man for you . He will be a scholar and have the ambition to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sighed . " May Li , if I had married another woman , I would have learned how to read and write , and I might have become a scholar or a government official myself . But I married the wrong woman . " " What had my mother to do with all your ill luck , father ? " " Plenty . You know , if your mother had nagged me a little , I would have gone to a school . But she was too nice , too nice . Killed herself with hard work , poor woman . " " Oh , you always think of mother and feel sad . " " Good people always die first , ' , ' Old Man Li said , shaking his head . " General White was a good man . Now he has also left us and gone to heaven . " " We shall make friends , father , " May Li said . " We shall meet new people in San Francisco . "  | " I hope Mr. Poon is a good man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recommend him to help us . " " I wonder what the consul general said of us in his letter of introduction , " Old Man Li said , bringing out a letter from his breast pocket . He turned the letter in his hands and said , " We are not supposed to read people 's letters , May Li . It is a sin to read people 's letters . " " You are not going to read this one , are you , father ? " " Of course not . . . but , but you know I do n't read much .. . perhaps it is harmless for me to take a glance at it . It is just like a blind man walking into a bathroom while a woman is taking a bath . He can not see , so no harm is done . " " There is no harm , I guess , " May Li said . Old Man Li blew the envelope open and peered into it . Then he gingerly fished the letter out and turned it in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glance at it , May Li , " he said , handing the letter to May Li . " Since it is not sealed , perhaps Mr. Poon does not mind people glancing at it . " " I guess not , " May Li said . She unfolded the letter and her eyebrows knitted . " It is written in foreign language , father . " " Shew , give it back to me . It is a sin to read people 's letters . " He quickly took the letter , folded it , replaced it in the envelope and pocketed it . " Finish your chow mein , May Li . We shall walk around in Chinatown and get acquainted with the place first . " " I like Grant Avenue , " May Li said , " Shall we open our restaurant on Grant Avenue ? " " Yes , if there is a place big enough . We shall open the largest restaurant in Chinatown , serving Northern food and wine . Maybe we have some entertainment , too . Do you remember what General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never talked to me about my singing , " May Li said . " You sing just like your mother . That is why the general did not tell you ; he did not want you to become conceited . Do you know what he said before he died ? He winked at me and said , Li , that  | daughter of yours will fly high if she is discovered . Her flower drum songs will make people eat off her little hands one of these days . ' That is what General White said , and it gave me the idea of opening a restaurant . When we have the restaurant , May Li , you will do nothing but sing and dance for the customers . " " And make them eat off my hands ? " May Li asked , laughing . " Well , you can make suggestions if the customers ask for your opinion of the food . It is much better than building a restaurant upstairs and make them eat more that way . Have you finished ? " " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place first . " They left the teahouse and walked northward on Grant . " Shew , the luggage is heavy , " Old Man Li said . " Let us find a hotel first . " " Maybe we should visit Mr. Poon first , father , " May Li said . " No . We are strangers . We should not visit him on New Year 's day . We shall go to see him tomorrow afternoon . Let us go to a hotel . " " Let me carry your bag . " " No , I am not that old . " " I can save energy for both of us if I carry your bag , father . " " How ? " " Put your bag down . " Old Man Li put his bag down . May Li tied it with hers and slung it over her left shoulder . " You see ? I even have my hands free now . " " Just like your mother , " Old Man Li said , shaking his head . " Balancing a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain . Well , I guess I still could carry my own luggage and walk fifty li without rest if General White did not spoil me . For fifteen years I was the laziest cook in China ... " " Here is a hotel , father , " May Li said , halting in front of a hotel beside a large restaurant , with a wide marble doorway leading to the second floor . Old Man Li looked at the impressive doorway and hesitated . " This is a first-class hotel , May Li , " he said . " Before we open our  | restaurant , maybe we should stay in a second-rate hotel . You know some Cantonese talk , maybe you should ask a passer-by to direct us to an inexpensive hotel nearby . " " All right , father . " They walked another block north . At the intersection of Grant and Sacramento , May Li stopped an old man and asked him in Cantonese where the cheap hotels were . The old man sized them up and jerked his head toward the east . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel rooms a dollar a day if you do not mind bedbugs . " Old Man Li understood a little Cantonese . He quickly turned east on Sacramento and motioned May Li to follow . " A dollar a day is good enough , " he said . " In China hotel rooms cost only three dollars a month . Times have changed . We can be a little luxurious these days . " As they walked toward Kearny firecrackers began to explode everywhere . Old Man Li straightened up and sighed . " Just like the old days in China , May Li . General White would enjoy this if he had not died . " He stopped under a long string of exploding firecrackers hung from the balcony of a two-story building , and inhaled deeply the powder smell . He stood there with his eyes closed and a smile on his face as though enjoying a cold shower on a hot day , whereas the tourists shunned the explosion , and a few ladies ran past him with fingers stuffed in their ears , screaming and laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , squared his shoulders and said , " Now , all my ill luck of the past year is blasted away . Our restaurant will be a great success in the Year of the Horse . " He dusted some firecracker fragments off his shoulders and picked his ears with his forefingers . " Shew , it was noisy ! Let us go find a hotel . " They found a small hotel on Kearny and climbed the rickety stairway to the clerk 's desk on the second floor . A Cantonese showed them two dark rooms smelling of stale tobacco . Old Man Li tested the squealing double bed in each room and nodded his head . " Good , they are soft . We shall take these two rooms . May Li ,  | let us take a nap first . The beds are good , and they cost a dollar a day , we must not waste them . " After a nap they had a light lunch of pork noodles at a small restaurant next door . Then they wandered around getting acquainted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; people roamed on the streets , wishing each other " kung he fa choy " ; housewives went from one food store to another , selecting the choicest fowl , the freshest fish and fruit and the tenderest vegetables , for the feasting was to last two weeks ; children , dressed in their best , searched for unexploded firecrackers and flocked to the stalls that sold sweetmeats and New Year candies ; merchants decorated their stores with new couplet scrolls and potted flowers wound about with red ribbons on which joyful greetings gleamed in gold characters ; music was everywhere  --  Cantonese opera , the eerie folk songs of the South , the modern Chinese music of tango and rumba . Old Man Li and May Li walked back and forth on Grant Avenue enjoying the sight and smell of the New Year . They walked until evening when Chinatown was all aglow . Family associations , framed in thousands of lights , shone like bejeweled palaces ; stores and large business establishments were radiant with neon signs and New Year lanterns . The restaurants were packed . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break his budget for the first time in fifteen years . " Let us have a good meal at a first-class restaurant , May Li . Are you hungry ? " " Yes , I can eat a water buffalo . " " Good , we shall eat a four-course dinner tonight . A full stomach on New Year 's Day insures a good New Year . " They dropped in at Hung Wa Low and got a little booth after half an hour 's waiting . They ordered a four-course family dinner and Old Man Li cleansed his stomach with two mouthfuls of his " social drink " before the dishes were brought in . Outside , people began to line up along the street . When Old Man Li and May Li finished their dinner the sidewalks were already packed , with children sitting on the curbs , elderly ladies resting quietly on grocery  | boxes , others standing behind them , three or four deep , craning their necks to look over others ' heads ; young lovers threaded through the crowd hand in hand , talking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is this ? Has some house caught fire ? " " The parade ; father , did n't the man at the consulate tell you about it ? " " That 's right , that 's right . I have forgotten it . Good , May Li , let us watch it . Shew , what a crowd ! " He took May Li 's arm and joined the waiting spectators . Presently two motorcycle policemen roared by . People turned their heads to the south end of the vacated Grant Avenue . Music was heard now ; firecrackers exploded sporadically , drowning a wild applause as many cars bearing important men began to glide down the street . The main body of the parade followed . Band after band strutted along the route , first the members of the armed forces ; then the gaudily dressed drum corps of the Chinatown middle schools , with their pretty leaders prancing and smiling and blowing their whistles ; then the costumed children and the flag-waving student bodies ; then the illuminated floats , on which the Chinatown Queen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and tossed fresh flowers at the applauding spectators ; and finally the block-long ferocious dragon , dancing to the special music of drums and gongs , prancing , leaping and twisting through the street amidst exploding firecrackers , its , glaring eyes ogling , its wide mouth gaping as if drunk on New Year 's wine . May Li was busy clapping her hands , Old Man Li , dazzled by the sight , suddenly felt nostalgic and wiped a bit of moisture from the corners of his eyes . When the parade was over the crowd started moving toward the north like a torrent . On the reviewing stand a show was on , a pretty Cantonese opera singer was singing to the accompaniment of a band of fu chin , the two-string violin , and the moom guitar . Old Man Li watched the show for a while and an idea came to his mind .  | " May Li , " he said excitedly , " we shall give a show , too . I am going to the hotel to get your flower drum and gong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " Oh , no , father , " May Li protested hastily . " Why not ? " Old Man Li said . " This is a good chance to find out how good you are . You are not afraid , are you ? " May Li swallowed . " No , but . . . " " Good , " Old Man Li interrupted , " when we open our restaurant in Chinatown , you are going to sing and dance for these people anyway . You wait here . I am going to get the instrument . Wait here , do n't move ! " Quickly he shouldered his way out of the crowd and hurried to the hotel . Fifteen minutes later he returned with a small flower drum with a strap and some red ribbons attached to it , and a shiny gong the size of a dinner plate . After he had handed the drum to May Li he started beating his gong . " Make room , honorable ladies and gentlemen , " he said in Cantonese with a heavy accent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to give a show , a flower drum show from the North , please make room , thank you ! " The crowd quickly opened up , clapping their hands . Old Man Li walked around in the circle made by the spectators and beat his gong . " Well , my little slave , " he said professionally , " what are we going to sing today ? " May Li pranced after her father . " The Flower Drum Song , " she said in an operatic tone , her left arm extended in an operatic gesture . " What are we going to play today ? " " The flower drum and the flower gong . " " Yes , the flower drum and the flower gong . " He beat his gong three times and asked , " Well , my little slave , what flower songs are you going to sing ? " " The Song of Feng-yong . " " What else ? " " The Song of Poor Little Chiu Hsiong. "  | Old Man Li beat his gong again and said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us can play and sing . When this little slave sings ... " " The song will be like a song . " " When I sing ... " " The noise will be like the broken gong . " " Ai , my little slave , " Old Man Li said . " Do you not know modesty ? Have I not taught you the teachings of Confucius ? " " Yes , my teacher , for ten years , when I was young . " " Then you should have read his great books and learned his eight virtues . " " How could I have ? Even you , my teacher , often hold his books upside down . " " Kind-hearted ladies and distinguished gentlemen , " Old Man Li said apologetically . " This little slave is spoiled . Do you know where I picked her up ? I picked her up ... " " Be careful , my teacher , this is our first visit to this friendly town ! " " All right , all right , our sage has well said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , little slave , this town is friendly and the people are nice ... " " And our show is good , so we must not keep the nice people waiting long ! " " All right , we shall start the singing as soon as forty more people come , forty more people . " " No , my teacher , four more people . When four more people come we shall sing our song . " " All right , four more people . Be patient , noble audience , patience is the tonic of life . " " Patience can turn gray hair black , weak to strong ! " " Ah , a venerable lady has come , " Old Man Li said . " Please make room for the venerable lady . Please make room ! Ah , three more gentlemen ! Little slave , we have four more now , what shall we do ? " " We shall beat the instrument and start the show ! "  | Old Man Li jumped to the center of the circle and beat his gong three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bows ! " May Li stopped prancing and bowed to the audience three times . " Kind-hearted ladies and distinguished gentlemen , my humblest bows to you . " " Kind-hearted ladies and distinguished gentlemen , " Old Man Li said , " if her song is good . . . " " Give me a little applause when I am through , " May Li said , bowing again . " If her song is bad ... " " Give me applause too . " Hastily Old Man Li beat his gong and May Li beat her drum , ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'iang , ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'iang , ch'iang t'ung , t'ung ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'iang . . . . When the overture was over Old Man Li stopped beating his gong and May Li started singing to the accompaniment of her drum : Say Feng-yong , sing Feng-yong , Feng-yong was once a wealthy town , But was cursed by the birth Of our emp'ror Chu-Yan-chong . Rich men took to lowly trade , Poor men 's sons were sold out of town ; I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg around . When she finished singing , Old Man Li joined in with his gong and they beat the instruments as before , ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'ang , ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'ang , ch'ang t'ung t'ung ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'ang . " Well , my little slave , " Old Man Li said . " Yes , my teacher . " " So , you are from the wealthy city of Feng-yong . " " Yes , my teacher , but I was sold out of town . " " Poor girl , have you no relative ? " " I have hundreds of them , fat and thin , old and young . "  | " When you were rich . . . " " They followed me like bloodhounds . " " When you were poor . . . " " Like the wind , they were all gone . " " Poor girl , you need someone to feed you . " " Right now , I can eat a Cantonese sausage a mile long . " " Shew ! No wonder nobody wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now I can eat a water buffalo , together with its old horn . " " Food does not fall from heaven , gold does not grow on the ground . " " Well said , my little slave . What do you suppose we do ? " " With our drum and gong , we shall sing our best song ! " They beat the instrument again in the same rhythm . When it was over , Old Man Li and May Li started singing together : Feng-yong drum , Fen-yen gong , With drum and gong we 'll sing a song . What shall we sing ? We only know the Feng-yong Song . Feng-la Feng-yang flow'r drum . Ai-ya-ai-hu-ya . Drrr-lang-dang p'iao-yi-p'iao . Then May Li sang : Sad is my fate , oh how sad ! I married a man with a flow'r drum . Stupid is he , Oh , how stupid and dumb . All day long he beats his singsong drum , Beats his singsong drum . Ai-ya-ai-hu-ya . Drrr-Lang-dang p'iao-yi-p'iao . Then Old Man Li sang : Sad is my fate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ugly mate .  | Of all the women you ever did meet , My wife has the largest pair of feet . Largest pair of feet . When they finished singing , Old Man Li laid his gong on the ground and bowed to the audience . " Kind-hearted ladies and distinguished gentlemen , if the song has pleased your honorable ears , please give this little slave an applause . " As the spectators applauded , May Li smiled and curtsied . Old Man Li picked up his gong , and using it as a plate he went around and began to collect coins . " Generous ladies and honorable gentlemen , if you really liked the song , please give this little slave a little appreciation fund , give whatever you like , just a little appreciation fund ... " Many people did n't understand his Cantonese , but they knew what he wanted and all dug into their pockets and in a few minutes his gong was full of nickels and dimes ; some appreciative tourists even tossed dollar bills into his gong . Back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty-five cents . Never in his life had he made so much money in one hour . He wrapped up the money with red paper and gave it to May Li , who was just as excited as her father about the unexpected gain . " This is the lucky money of the Year of the Horse , " said Old Man Li . " Keep it in your inner pocket and never spend it . The people of San Francisco are generous , May Li . It is a good sign . With your flower songs and my cooking , we are going to have a great future in this town . Let us sleep late tomorrow , and go visit Mr. Poon as soon as we finish our lunch . " After lunch the next day they went to Jackson Street to visit Mr.  | Poon . They rang the doorbell of the two-story house and a fat woman answered the door . " We have come to see Mr. Poon of Peking , " Old Man Li said politely in Cantonese with a heavy Mandarin accent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the fat woman said in Mandarin with a heavy Hunan accent . Old Man Li looked at the number and scratched his neck . " The house number is right , " he said . " There is no Mr. Poon living here , " the woman said , shutting the door . They rang the bell again and the woman flung the door open and said heatedly , " I said there is no Mr. Poon in this house ! " " But the number . . . " Before Old Man Li finished the woman slammed the door shut . " Shew , what an ill-tempered old hag ! May Li , you read the house number once more and see if it is right . Maybe I am old ... " " It is the right number , father , " May Li said , checking the address on the envelope . " Maybe Mr. Consul General wrote the wrong address . " " Is this Jackson Street ? " " Yes . The street sign says it is . The foreign word on the sign is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , all foreign words look alike to me . Maybe we should ask somebody . Strange , I do n't see a male or female on the whole street . Where are all the people ? Put down your luggage , May Li , let us rest our legs for a while . Shew , I have never met anyone so impolite . She is not a Cantonese . Shew , what an ill-tempered woman ! " They put down their luggage , sat down on the steps and rested for a moment . A car passed by . Old Man Li shot up and shouted at it but it did n't stop . " Maybe we should give a show here , " he said , sitting down again . " Nobody will see our show on this street , " May Li said . " It is so quiet and lonesome here . " " Lonesome ? No place will be lonesome when I beat my good gong . " Old Man Li brought his gong out of his bag . " May Li , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show . " He got up and started beating his small gong . A few housewives pushed their windows up and stuck their heads out to see what was going on . " Father , I see someone now , " May Li said excitedly . " What did I tell you , " Old Man Li said , beating his gong more violently . " People always appear when they hear my good gong . Take out my whip and beard , May Li , and have your flower drum ready ! Quickly ! " May Li took out the things as told and then joined her father with her flower drum , beating it in their usual rhythm , ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'iang , ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'iang , ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'iang t'ung t'ung ch'iang ... . Suddenly the fat woman flung the door open and said , " Who are making so much noise in front of this house ? Why , are you two still here ? " " We have just played a little music here , " Old Man Li @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . " " This is Old Master Wang 's house , no monkey . players are allowed to disturb his afternoon nap . Go away , go away ! " " We are not monkey players , " May Li said heatedly . " We are strangers in Chinatown . We shall go when we are ready , you do not have to show so many of your teeth and growl . " Liu Ma stepped out of the front door and shook a finger at May Li . " If you do not scramble out of here immediately , you will see what is going to happen to you , you beggar maid ! " May Li sait down on her bag with a snort . " Father , we are going to stay right here . I want to see what is going to happen to us . " " What is going to happen to you ? You will be arrested . You will be thrown into jail ! You will die and rot , and your bones will be thrown to the hills to poison the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and never return to China ... " " Thank you , thank you , " Old Man Li interrupted . " We have our future all well planned by ourselves , you do not have to bother with it , woman . Your job at the moment is to inform your old master that if he does not like music and song , he may stuff his ears with cotton and cover his head with three wet blankets ... "  | " Ah , may thunder strike you to death for insulting the Old Master in front of his own house ! " Liu Ma said . " If you were in China , you would have been thrown into jail long time ago ... " Wang Ta was returning from school . He came up the steps hurriedly and asked , " What is going on here ? " " This old man has just insulted the Old Master , " Liu Ma said , " and that beggar maid . . . " " We are singers , " May Li said . " We have just played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Liu Ma shouted . " They have just made a lot of noise here to disturb the Old Master 's afternoon nap .. " Let this young lady talk , " Wang Ta interrupted . Then he turned to May Li and asked , " What were you about to say ? " " I was about to say that the Old Master in this house has certainly hired the right woman to guard his door . I have traveled from China to America and I have never heard any dog that could bark as loud as she does ! " Liu Ma barked , " Oh , you beggar maid , may a thousand thunderbolts strike you to ashes ... " " Stop this shouting , " Wang Ta said . " You are disturbing the Old Master 's nap yourself . " " All right ! " Liu Ma said . " I am going to tell the Old Master . You will see what is going to happen to you , you miserable beggars , hummph ! " She hurried into the house and slammed the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li said , putting her drum into her bag . Wang Ta was somewhat amused by the scene . He said with a chuckle , " Do n't be afraid , that woman is only a maidservant . She thinks she is still in Hunan Province in China , where the Old Master can do anything . Did you say you are a singer ? " " Yes , " May Li said , " we are flower song singers ... " " I am also a cook , " Old Man Li said hastily . " I cooked for General White for fifteen years ... " " What flower songs can you sing ? " Wang Ta asked May Li . " I can sing songs of filial piety , songs of loyal officials , songs of gods and ghosts , songs of love and misery ... "  | " We are high-class singers , " Old Man Li said . " We do not sing vulgar songs like A Woman in Love with Her Pillow , ' or The Young Widow Sighs in Front of Two Pairs of Chopsticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , mister , " May Li asked , " do you know where Mr. Poon of Peking lives ? " Wang Ta frowned slightly . " Mr. Poon of Peking ? No , but I shall look it up in the telephone directory and find out his address for you . What is his full name ? " " We have his address , " May Li said . " He lives in this house . " " Oh , I know whom you mean ! " Wang Ta said . " No wonder the name is familiar ! He was the owner of this house before . He sold it and moved to Hawaii four years ago . Have you known him long ? " " We have not met him , " Old Man Li said . " The consul general in Los Angeles , a good friend of General White , wrote this letter of introduction for us . He said Mr. Poon could help us open a Peking restaurant in San Francisco . " He hastily dug out the letter and showed it to Wang Ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Wang Ta said after reading the letter . " My daughter and I plan to open the only Peking restaurant in Chinatown , " Old Man Li said , " with singing and dancing . . . " " Oh , father , " May Li interrupted , " no use talking about it now . Mr. Poon is not here to help us , and we do n't know anybody else in this town . " Old Man Li shrugged his shoulders . " Guess you are right , May Li . Maybe we will have to change our plans . But the Year of the Horse will be a good year for us , May Li . We have nothing to worry about . Let us go back to the hotel . " He turned to Wang Ta and asked , " Mister , could you tell us where to find a small hotel with reasonable price and no bedbugs ? " Wang Ta looked at May Li . " Well , there might be cheap hotels without bedbugs but they have drunkards instead . Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall find a place for you to stay temporarily . "  | " Please do n't recommend us to any expensive place , mister , " Old Man Li said . " It will cost you nothing , Mr. Li , " Wang Ta said with a chuckle . " Charity house ? " Old Man Li said hastily . " No , mister , I stayed in a charity house once ; I paid nothing but I lost my pants . " " Follow me , Mr. Li , you will not lose anything in this house . " Wang Ta opened the front door with his key . " What ? " Old Man Li said , stepping back from the door . " This house ? " " Why not ? " Wang Ta said , holding the door open for them . " This is my house . The Old Master is my father . " " Oh , no , oh , no , " Old Man Li said , waving his hand . " At least you can leave your luggage here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " while we go and look for a rooming house for you . " " Come , father , " May Li said happily , dragging her father toward the door , " please do n't be afraid . We are guests of the Young Master ! " 4 Today was the third day of the Year of the Horse . Old Master Wang decided to stay in bed for an extra hour in the morning to recuperate from the New Year celebration . He enjoyed the morning cough and the memory of the celebration . He was completely satisfied with the New Year 's Day , which had passed without a sin-  | gle bad omen . He hoped that by next year he would have a daughter-in-law and a grandchild and another addition the year after . He hoped that from the Year of the Horse the family would really start growing .

According to Miss Shaw , there were two ways to get Wang Ta 's picture bride to America ; one was to apply for an immigration quota , the other was to wait for Wang Ta to become a citizen . Both ways took a little time , Miss Shaw had said at Madam Tang 's banquet , but she had hastily added a few lucky words befitting a New Year occasion , something like May God bless the couple . ' Old Master Wang was satisfied with Miss Shaw 's opinion ; besides , his late wife , heaven bless her soul , would also help . Her spirit would undoubtedly influence everybody concerned and help the Wang family grow . He thought of this and felt a contentment that was almost happiness . He changed his position in the large bed and coughed for a few moments , grunting and groaning with pleasure , and wondering whether he should get up . Then he heard Liu Ma 's voice scolding someone . He did n't want to interrupt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure in the house besides his bamboo stick , which could only be used to whip Wang San , now . He listened to Liu Ma 's scolding with an approving nod , but it was not until he found out she was only tongue-lashing her stone-deaf husband that he decided it was a complete waste of breath . " Liu Ma , " he called , " Liu Ma ... " Liu Ma , who was mopping the furniture and scolding Liu Lung in the middle hall , heard Old Master Wang 's call and hurried into his room to prepare his toilet articles . Washing his face was one of the Old Master 's major events in the morning and he demanded a careful preparation for it : the water in the washbasin must have the right temperature , the soap must be on  | the exact spot so that he could reach for it without looking , the towel must be perfumed , the dental cream squeezed and lying properly on the tooth brush , which in turn must be placed properly on a glass of lukewarm water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma saw to it that the Old Master depended only on her for them . When preparing for the Old Master 's toilet , Liu Ma contemplated the most effective way to impart the news of the two unwelcome guests whom Wang Ta had invited into the house . She disliked both of them , especially the young wench with the red cheeks , who had unceremoniously compared her to a fierce watchdog yesterday at the front door . The more she thought of the girl , the angrier she became . She decided not to tell the Old Master of the visitors while he was washing ; she needed more time to tell the news and must have his complete attention . ' When she returned to the middle hall , Liu Lung , her husband , was still there sweeping the floor energetically . She was n't in a good mood the whole morning on account of the guests , and automatically she resumed her scolding , " Liu Lung , you are already not fit to be a husband , can not you try to make yourself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ear and asked , " En  --  n ? " " Do you not know how to sweep a floor properly ? " she shouted into his ear , snatching the broom from his hand . " Sweep it slowly and gently , not like a windmill , hula hula blowing the dust all over the house ! " " O  --  oh , " Liu Lung said with a nod . " All right , try again , " she said , thrusting the broom back into his hands . While Liu Lung resumed his sweeping in the same manner , Liu Ma watched him with mounting anger . She watched him with her lips tightly pursed and arms akimbo until she could n't stand it any more . " I said sweep the floor slowly and gently ! " she cried , stamping one of her feet . " Look at the table . I have just mopped it clean , now it is covered with dust an inch thick . Each time  | you sweep the floor , I must mop everything twice . Is not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Liu Lung handed the broom to his wife and said , " You sweep the floor , I mop the table . " Liu Ma snatched the broom from his hand . " Oh , why must God punish me by throwing me at a waste bag like you ? " " En  --  n ? " " I said you were a good for nothing idiot , a deaf and dumb old turtle ! " " Oh , " Liu Lung said , " I heard that before . " He picked up the rag which his wife had thrown at him and started mopping the table calmly . " Oh , I am miserable , " Liu Ma said , sweeping the floor angrily . " Men are worse one after another . You are the worst I have met . " She gathered up the dust into a heap and swept it under the kang . Then she put the broom away and came back to let more steam out of her system . " Liu Lung , I ask you , how much money did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . " " You lie . Your breath smells like a brewery ! " " I did not drink . I had only one little sip from that old man 's flask . " " What old man ? " " En  --  n ? " " I said what old man ? " Liu Ma cried . " Oh , Old Man Li , the old man who moved in last night . " The information was like a wasp sting on a spot that was already sore . " Oh , you good-for-nothing idiot , " Liu Ma said , trying not to raise her voice lest the whole house could hear her , " you disgrace me ! If I find you talking to that old dirty beggar again , you can go away and sleep somewhere else , never come near me again ! " " En  --  n ? " " I said , you keep away from me ! " Liu Ma cried . " You go sleep in the basement with the rats ! '  | Liu Lung 's dull face suddenly brightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too much of an effort to quarrel with her husband , Liu Ma decided . ' Whenever she quarreled with him she always got angrier and he got happier , and consequently she never seemed to be able to win the quarrel . " Oh , you deaf and dumb old turtle , " she concluded despairingly , " I waste my breath shouting at you ! " She sat down in a chair and had a cigarette , then she heard a spasm of coughing . She threw a rag at Liu Lung and ordered , " The Old Master has finished his toilet . Go bring his ginseng soup . Take the rags and bucket with you . " Wang Chi-yang came to the middle hall , coughing . He decided to drink his ginseng soup on the kang every morning from now on as he always had in the old house in China . It would please his late wife 's spirit , he thought , if he gradually went back to his old life pattern , resuming all his old habits as though nothing had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily and coughed . He was still tired , having had a heavy day yesterday . The two Chinatown banquets had given him some indigestion and the Cantonese opera at night had exhausted him . In a way he was glad that the New Year came only once a year . " Liu Lung is bringing your ginseng soup , Old Master , " Liu Ma said , ready to report the bad news of the two unexpected visitors . " Come and beat my shoulders , " Wang Chi-yang said , turning slightly on the kang . Liu Ma went to his left side and started beating his shoulders with her palms in a fast , flowery rhythm , waiting for him to inquire about the general welfare of the household . " Hm , humph , " the Old Master grunted with pleasure , ! ' what day is today of the week ? " " Saturday , Old Master . " " Hm , humph . Where is Young Master Wang San this morn-ing ? " Liu Ma was in such a bad mood that even Wang San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her shoe . " He is in the street  | playing with the urchins as usual . I worry about him , Old Master . " " Liu Ma , " Old Master Wang said , " you have been working for the Wang family for more than twenty years . Since the last mistress passed away , you are the only woman I can trust in this house . From now on you take some care of Wang San . Tomorrow you shut him in his room and make him read the books of Confucius . Tell him if he goes to play with street urchins again , I shall lame his legs . " He coughed a little more and Liu Ma beat his shoulders a little faster . " Is the breakfast ready ? " " Not yet , " Liu Ma said . " The cook is getting lazy . He had a visitor last night ... " " Tell him the breakfast must be ready as soon as I have had my ginseng soup . As the late mistress always said , Spring is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the day . ' From now on I want everybody in this house to get up early , like the old times in China . If anybody misses his breakfast , tell him to tighten his belt and wait for lunch . Make this clear especially to the young masters . " Suddenly Liu Ma stopped beating . It was the right moment for the bad news , she thought . She leaned close to Wang Chi-yang 's ear and said confidentially , " Old Master , do you know what Young Master Wang Ta did this morning ? He was out of bed , washed and all dressed up before sunrise . And he already had his breakfast with the servants ! " Wang Chi-yang scowled slightly . " Why ? Has he finally decided to start a new life ? Where is he this morning ? " " He has been with his new friends the whole morning , " Liu Ma said emphatically . " Hm , humph , " Old Master Wang said with a nod of approval , " I am glad he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this time on a Saturday . Who are these people ? " " Two beggars , sir . " " What ? " " A dirty old man and his ugly daughter . Young Master Wang Ta  | invited them into this house yesterday . I wanted to tell you yesterday but you went out after your afternoon nap and did not come home until after midnight . " " Did they pass the night here ? " " They slept in the guest rooms upstairs . I am afraid they have brought fleas and bedbugs into this house . " " Wash the beddings when they are gone , " Wang Chi-yang said . " What beggars ? I have never seen any beggars in Chinatown . " " They are from China . They speak Mandarin . The girl 's mouth is full of foul language . " " Oh , the rebellious dog , " Wang Chi-yang said , shaking his head with a deep sigh . " Since he began to follow the religion of that man nailed on a cross , this has become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live here for five weeks , now two beggars . I do not mind students ; they are refugees from good families . But beggars ! Liu Ma , when they leave the house , keep an eye on them . See if their pockets are bulging . " " Ease your mind , - Old Master , " Liu Ma said , resuming the beating . " Nobody can take a bit of dust out of this house if I have my eyes on him ! " Wang Chi-yang 's cough was subsiding . He could have enjoyed a day of relaxation after the strenuous New Year celebration , but now the information about the beggars began to bother him . " It is enough beating , " he said . " Tell Young Master Wang Ta to come . " " He went out with his new friends , Old Master . They went out immediately after they had breakfast with us . Heavens ! How that beggar maid can eat ! " " Tell Wang Ta to see me as soon as he comes back , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell Liu Lung to bring my ginseng soup to my room . " " Yes , Old Master . " Old Master Wang retired to his room . After he had his ginseng soup , his breakfast and pipe , he was in no mood to practice his calligraphy and English writing . He wondered where Wang Ta had picked up the beggars . The boy should have asked his permis-  | sion before he brought strangers into the house . After his wife 's death , his sons had become more uncontrollable . He hoped that the girl in Hong Kong would be someone like his late wife , who always had a few clever methods in dealing with men . In dealing with him , he recalled that her boycott method ' had been one of her most effective weapons . It was not so strict as to make him desire a concubine , yet strict enough to make him behave the way she had wanted . When he thought of it now he could n't help nodding to himself with approval . He wondered whether the method had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , he thought , he was glad of it . Children raised in this modern world were not exactly a blessing . Perhaps Wang Ta could make up the loss by producing a few more . Before lunch he went back to the middle hall to sit on the kang for a while . The kang and the decorations helped him recall the good old days in the old house in China . From now on perhaps he should make it a habit  --  a half hour 's , meditation , on the kang before lunch . Just as he had closed his eyes and his mind had wandered back to the ancient home in Hunan Province , he heard Liu Ma greet his sister-in-law . " How are you , Madam Tang ? " " Not good , not bad , " Madam Tang said . " Good morning , my sister 's husband . " With a bit of irritation , Old Master Wang opened his eyes . " Good morning , my wife 's sister . " Madam Tang looked as busy as ever . She seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I have a few important things to discuss with you today . Have you had lunch yet ? " " Not yet , " Wang Chi-yang said . " Good . Liu Ma , tell the taxi man not to wait . I decided to have lunch here . " Liu Ma was laying the table for lunch in the dining hall . She answered her and hurried out . " I have good news , my sister 's husband , " Madam Tang said , inserting a cigarette in an ivory holder . " I had the girl 's picture carefully analyzed . Mr. Foon , the leading physiognomist in China-  | town , has assured me that the girl has five blessings behind her future , but not the blessing of longevity . The girl has a short chin , it means she will die young ; besides , I have inquired about her chances of coming to America . To apply for an immigration quota , it takes about ten years ; to wait for Wang Ta to become a citizen , it takes five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring his wife over , it will take another five years . Again ten years . By the time she arrives in this country , it is about time for her to die ... " " My wife 's sister , " Wang Chi-yang interrupted irritably , " is this the good news you have brought me ? " " I am telling the good news in a moment , " Madam Tang said . She put her cigarette down , fished out the girl 's photo from her handbag and returned it to Wang Chi-yang . " Please send the pictures back . Tell the herb doctor that the match can not be made because of the immigration difficultues . You can pay him a hundred dollars for all the trouble he has taken to arrange this match , if you wish . . . " " We can not act so hastily , " Want Chi-yang said . " The herb doctor himself is a physiognomist . If the girl is destined to die young , he would have told me ... " " My sister 's husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young or live a long life is not a problem of great importance . Can you wait for ten years for Wang Ta to take a wife ? He will be forty and you will be over seventy . Perhaps you will never have the opportunity to see a grandson . " " There must be some way , " Wang Chi-yang said , " some other way to bring the girl to this foreign land . " " Yes , there is another way  --  an illegal ' way , " Madam Tang said . " You can hire an American citizen to do the job . The hired man can go to Hong Kong , marry the girl in name , bring her over and divorce her . It will cost a great deal of money ; besides , you never can trust a hired man in such matters . It will be like asking a stranger to bring a package of candy to relatives across the ocean ; if the stranger delivers it at all , nobody can guarantee that  | he has not opened it and stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is illegal . Do you want a daughter-in-law who is ... " " My wife 's sister , " Wang Chi-yang said hastily , " it is out of the question . Marriage is sacred ; it is out of the question . ' What is the good news ? " Madam Tang puffed on her cigarette a few times . " Do you remember Mr. Loo ? " " The Shanghai Loo or the Cantonese Loo ? " " The Shanghai Loo , the one who was once the mayor of Hang Chow . " Wang Chi-yang remembered the man . He was a friend of Madam Tang 's husband and had worked for the Japanese during the war . He did n't think too much of him . " Yes , " he said , " a man distinguished for his Japanese mustache . " " He has shaved it . " " Hm , humph , he still has his Japanese wife , I presume . What is the good news about ? " " Mr. Loo has asked me to bring you an oral invitation  --  shark'sfin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hm , I wonder why he has become so hospitable ? " " That is what I have come to talk to you about , my sister 's husband , " Madam Tang said enthusiastically . " His three daughters have all grown up . How could he marry them off to good families if he does not invite select people to eat more dinners ? " " Do you mean he intends to dispose of one of his daughters at my house ? " Wang Chi-yang asked , with a scowl . " Perhaps two , " Madam Tang said emphatically , " if he knows that your second son , Wang San , is growing fast . But never mind , he will be disillusioned when he sees the boy . But for Wang Ta , I know the old man has taken a fancy to him . He inquires about him each time I go to his house . My sister 's husband , can not you see this is as clear as a mirror ? " Wang Chi-yang disapproved of interracial marriage and he abhorred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was half Japanese . He said hastily , " I do not know his daughters well ... "  | " The second one is excellent , " Madam Tang said , her enthusiasm mounting , " even the ex-governor of Hopei takes a fancy to her , but that stupid son of his wants to choose his own wife . Now General Liu , that ex-warlord from Szechuan , has begun to make friends with the family , but his son is a good-for-nothing playboy . If the girl falls into his hands , it would be like a fresh flower falling into a garbage can . My sister 's husband , if we want the girl we will have to act soon , or General Liu will be ahead of us . " " I am sorry , my wife 's sister , " ' Wang Chi-yang said . " I can not accept the dinner invitation . " " What ? " Madam Tang asked , looking shocked . Wang Chi-yang poured himself a cup of tea from his Kiangsi teapot . " I can accept the invitation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner , no . I do not know any of Mr. Loo 's daughters . " " My sister 's husband , " Madam Tang said irritably , " every man of your age has a strong desire to tickle a plump little baby which is his own grandchild . You do not seem to be interested in this pleasure . This is most strange ! " " To be frank with you , my wife 's sister , " Old Master Wang said , blowing and sipping his tea in an effort to reduce the heat of the argument , " I do not wish to have foreign blood in my family . " " Japanese blood is most fashionable these days , " Madam Tang said . " Many white Americans have taken Japanese wives and are calling them baby dolls , ' a most affectionate way of addressing a wife in this country . Besides , this girl is only half Japanese ; she is intelligent , filial , quiet , and not so pretty ; she makes an ideal daughter-in-law ! " " I can not decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma , " Madam Tang called , rising , " go call a taxi . " " Yes , Madam Tang , " Liu Ma answered from the dining room , " but the lunch is ready ... " " The talk is over . I decided not to have lunch in a house where everything is so old-fashioned . Go call the taxi . " " Yes , madam . " " My sister 's husband , " she turned back to her brother-in-law  | and said heatedly , " you are going to regret it . Someday you will be in deep remorse for having not grabbed that girl ! " Old Master Wang blew and sipped his tea . " I can not decide , I can not decide . " Madam Tang left the house in anger . It was the first time she had lost an argument . She could induce Wang Ta to marry the girl , but losing an argument was something else ; it bothered her extremely . Going downtown in a taxi , she decided to return to her brother-in-law 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won . 5 To Old Man Li , the guest room in the house of Wang was luxurious . The bed was so soft and wide , the bedding so neat and clean that he was sure no bedbugs could have existed in them . Compared to the small smelly hotel room for which he had paid a dollar a day , this was indeed a heaven . It was a miracle that he and May Li had stayed in such a large house for one night , all for free . Although the fat , glaring woman was somewhat unpleasant , yet the experience on the whole was a pleasant one . He liked the young master of the house and Liu Lung , the deaf servant , who seemed to treat him like a long-lost brother . The Year of the Horse had a good start .  | But he would hate to take advantage of the situation and stay another night . It would n't be right . When Wang Ta suggested after breakfast that they go look for a rooming house for them , Old Man Li @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could find a place nearby so that he could associate with such a nice family . He had not met the Old Master yet , but he was sure that only a nice old gentlemen could have produced a young master so generous and friendly . The house-hunting was n't too successful . The places they visited were either too far away or too expensive . May Li did n't seem to mind it ; she enjoyed the ride in Wang Ta 's car so much that she innocently admitted that she liked house-hunting every day and hoped that tomorrow would be the same . Old Man Li was embarrassed by her frankness ; he apologized to Wang Ta and told him repeatedly that she was only a country lass . Wang Ta liked frank girls ; they immediately put him at ease . He liked May Li 's company and he , too , secretly enjoyed the fruitless hunting . Before dinner they returned , happily frustrated . The moment Liu Ma saw them she said to Wang Ta gravely , her eyes glancing at Old Man Li and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you , Young Master . " Wang Ta went to his father 's room , where he seldom went unless necessary . He found his aunt there having a heated argument with his father , but the moment they saw him they stopped . Both seemed to be in a bad mood . He smiled and greeted his aunt . " How are you , my aunt ? " " Not good , not bad , " Madam Tang said . " Have you sent for me , father ? " Wang Ta asked . " How dare you bring strangers into this house without asking for my permission ? " Old Master Wang said . " Who are they ? " " They are innocent people , father , too poor to rent a hotel room to pass a cold night . " " Very good , " Madam Tang said with a nod of approval , then she turned to her brother-in-law and added : " He has a philanthropic nature , inherited from my sister , who was born with a charitable heart . "  | 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " I asked you who are these people ? " " They are artists , father . They sing and act . " " What ? " Madam Tang asked , slightly shocked . " Have some actors passed a night here ? " " Yes . They would have frozen to death in some public park if I had not invited them in . " Madam Tang did n't have a high opinion of actors , especially actors who did n't even have a bed to sleep in . She pointed a finger at her nephew and asked , " You mean you picked them up in a public park ? " " No , my aunt , " Wang Ta said hastily . " They were looking for the ex-landlord . , of this . house . They did not know he had moved to Hawaii four years ago . They had no place to go so I invited them in ... " " You should have asked for my permission first , " Wang Chiyang said . " The world is full of bad people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frail old man and a young girl do any harm ? " " What ? " Madam Tang said , more shocked . " A young girl ? " " Yes , my aunt . She is the old man 's daughter . They have a letter of recommendation from the consul general at Los Angeles . " " Where are they from ? " Old Master Wang asked . " They are from Mainland China , speaking Mandarin . They have no money , no friends ... " " How old is the girl ? " Madam Tang asked . " Perhaps seventeen , perhaps older . " " Bad age , " Madam Tang said . " They want to open a night club in Chinatown , " Wang Ta said . " The old man can also cook . " " Ridiculous , " Madam Tang said . " They want to open a night club and yet they do not even have the money to rent a hotel bed . " " Well , that is their worry , my aunt . " " How old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps sixty-five , I do n't know . "  | " Is he deaf ? " " He can hear a needle drop in a haystack . " " My sister 's husband , " Madam Tang said , " since this old man is going to starve , why do n't you hire him to take Liu Lung 's place ? I also need a little slave to water my garden ; I may use the girl if she is clean . " " I have enough servants already , " Wang Chi-yang said . " Liu Lung is so deaf that even if an atomic bomb exploded in his ear he would not hear it , " Madam Tang said . " You can still keep him on a charity basis ; this old man . . . what is his name , Wang Ta ? " " Old Man Li . " " Yes , this old man is a refugee from Mainland China . It is always cheap to hire refugees as servants . If you do not want the old man , my sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wang Ta , " said Old Master Wang , " tell them to come in . I shall take a look at the old man before I can make the decision . " Wang Ta had expected a scolding from both his father and his aunt ; now that the interview turned out so differently he was quite surprised . He was afraid that Old Man Li and May Li might not like the idea of working as servants , but when he went to them and told them of the job offering they jumped at it . Wang Ta brought them to his father 's room and introduced them to his father and his aunt . Old Man Li rubbed his hands humbly and bowed low . " Old Mr. Wang , " he said , using the choicest words at his command , " your distinguished name has been rumbling in my ears like a great thunder since I set foot in this honorable Chinatown . It is indeed a great honor and privilege to see you . May Li , bow to Old Mr. Wing for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chi-yang . " Ten thousand benedictions to you , sir . " Wang Chi-yang was pleased . It was a long time since he had received from people such old-fashioned courtesy . He waved his hand and grunted , " Hm , humph , no ceremony , no ceremony . " He asked Old Man Li a few questions about his past and exam-  | fined the letter of recommendation from the consul general , then he decided to use him . " Old Man Li , you look like an honest man and you are from Mainland China , speaking an understandable dialect . I intend to give you a job ; arc you interested ? " Old Man Li bowed again . " Oh , where else can I have a greater pleasure ? I only hope that my humble flesh and bones could render their services satisfactorily in this great house . " " I would like to work here , too , Old Mr. Wang , " May Li said . " Really , you do n't look so dignified and horrible as we expected . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her mouth to hide any sign of mirth ; Wang Ta turned his eyes to the ceiling , wiping the sweat on his hands inside his trouser pockets . Old Man Li coughed in great embarrassment . " Old Mr. Wang , " he said apologetically , " she is only a country lass , she does not know the city people 's good manners . May Li , bow to Madam Tang . " May Li bowed . " Ten thousand benedictions to the madam . " " Hm , " Madam Tang said , sizing her up carefully , " you look neat and clean outside . " " Thank you , madam , " May Li said . " Old Man Li , " Old Master Wang said , " I want you to understand that I employ you not because I need more servants . You are old , you can not help much in the housework . I only hire you on a charitable basis , do you understand ? " " Surely , surely , " Old Man Li said hastily . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang . " " Your daily routine here will be cleaning the back yard , sweeping the porch and watering the flowers . Little errands like mailing a letter or buying cigarettes for guests will be your extra work . " " Well , that would be just like a vacation to me , " Old Man Li said cheerfully . " I only hope that my humble flesh and bones could be of more use to you , Old Mr. Wang . Ha , ha . " " Although the work here is light , " Old Master Wang said sternly , " diligence , honesty and obedience are strictly observed in this house . " " Oh , you do n't have to remind me of virtue and morals , Old  | Mr. Wang . Confuciva has already taught me all that . And I am not an ungrateful old bone . Tomorrow , if you find a dead leaf in the back yard or a single bit of dust on the porch , you may curse my ancestors up to five generations , and I will not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girl , " Madam Tang said to May Li , " good discipline is the first rule in my house . No loud laughter , no noisy talk are allowed . " " Yes , madam . " " Second , cleanliness . I do not want you to bring any of your own belongings with you . Old clean clothes will be provided in my house . " " Madam , am I not going to work in this house ? " " No ! Third , woman 's virtue . No indecency is permitted either in conduct or in conversation . " " But , madam , " May Li interrupted , " I want to work in this house . " " Do not talk back ! " Madam Tang said hotly . " Oh , Mr. Wang , " May Li said , turning to Wang Ta , " ca n't I work here with my father ? " " My aunt , " Wang Ta said , " perhaps this girl does not want to be separated from her father . Could you not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not think I can not get help , " Madam Tang said , rising from the kang . " Many , Chinatown girls are anxious to work for me .

He said politely , " Are you not going to have dinner with us ? " " No , " Madam Tang said , starting for the door , " I am busy . " After Madam Tang was gone , Wang Chi-yang coughed with , dignity and said , " Old Man Li , you can settle down in this house and start working tomorrow . Liu Ma , give some work for this girl to do tomorrow . " Liu Ma , who had been watching the hiring with apprehension ,  | cast May Li a poisonous glance and said emphatically , " I will , Old Master . " After dinner Wang Chi-yang retired to his room . Wang Ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall for a social evening . Liu Lung was serving them tea . " Well , work starts tomorrow , " Wang Ta said to his guests , " you might as well sit down on the kang and make yourselves comfortable while you are still my guests today . Liu Lung , you may take a rest too , and calm your breath with a cigarette . " He offered a cigarette to the deaf servant , who accepted it with a smile and went to a corner to smoke it ; Old Man Li and May Li sat down on the kang , sipping tea . " This is certainly the most fashionable house I have set foot in , " May Li said , looking around curiously . " Mr. Wang , are all these writings on the wall poetry ? " " Yes , " Wang Ta said . " My father 's calligraphy . Everybody admires it but nobody understands it . Smoke , Old Man Li ? " " Yes , yes , " Old Man Li said eagerly . Wang Ta offered him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li held the cigarette between his thumb and forefinger and put it between his outstretched lips gingerly .

" Wang Ta asked . " Oh , yes ! " May Li said hastily . " Do n't encourage her to smoke , Mr. Wang , " Old Man Li said . " She smoked my water pipe once and she coughed a whole day . " " What was wrong ? " Wang Ta asked . " Did some smoke get into your windpipe ? " " No , some water , " May Li said . " This is dry , " Wang Ta said . " It is safe .

" " I know what my father wants to say , " May Li interrupted briskly , " he wants to know how much you are going to pay him . " Old Man Li coughed with embarrassment . " Well , well , it is like this , Mr. Wang . We 'd like to open a Peking restaurant in Chinatown , with singing and dancing and serving the best Peking duck , but it takes money to open such a restaurant . I just want to figure  --  well  --  just to figure out how much we can save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " my father is not a stingy man ; probably he will pay you as much as he pays Liu Lung . Liu Lung , how much money do you make here every month ? " He made a gesture with both his hands to help Liu Lung understand his question . " How much money do I make ? " Liu Lung said behind the thick cigarette smoke that he was producing by vigorous puffing . " I make nothing . " " What ? " Wang Ta asked , somewhat surprised . " Does not my father pay you any salary at all ? " " Salary ? " Liu Lung said . " Surely he pays me . He pays me in the morning ; my wife takes it away in the night , so I make nothing . " " Liu Lung , " Wang Ta said with a scowl , " each time I see you , I decide that celibacy is my chosen future . Old Man Li , do n't worry about your salary , in time you will save enough money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I do n't know when , but I think I eventually will  --  I shall invest in your business and back you . " " Do you hear that , May Li ? " Old Man Li said cheerfully . " You work hard here , May Li . When we leave this great house to start our own business , we shall leave with a good reputation . "  | Liu Lung vaguely understood what they had been talking about . He put a hand behind his ear and asked , " You work here , too , Old Man Li ? " " Can not say work , Liu Lung , " Old Man Li shouted . " Just attempt to cheat a bowlof rice out of the kind-hearted masters in this house , that is all , ha , ha ! " " Good , good , you work here too , good ! " Liu Lung said . He hurried to Old Man Li , lifted up his Chinese gown and showed him a flask that was hanging on his belt . " You see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile he quickly hid it again . " I show you the back yard , en  --  n ? " " Sure , sure , " Old Man Li said with an understanding nod . " Mr. Wang , excuse me , I am going to get acquainted with this great house a little . Come , Liu Lung . " They went to the back yard through the kitchen , laughing and patting each other on the shoulders . Wang Ta and May Li looked at them indulgently , then turned to each other and smiled . " Do you like this room ? " Wang Ta asked . " It is an exact copy of the middle hall of the old house in China . Everything is arranged just as my mother wanted it in the old house , the decorations , the pictures , everything . Do you like the pictures ? " " I like that man , " May Li said , pointing at the god of longevity on the wall . " He has a funny face . He looks as if someone is tickling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it , and laughed . Wang Ta followed her to the picture . " Be careful what you say . He is not a man . " " Not a man ? How could a woman look like that ? " " He is an immortal , " Wang Ta said . " One of the high officials in the celestial world . He controls people 's ages . " " You mean he is the god of longevity ? " " Yes . " May Li bowed to the picture and murmured in reverence , " Oh , god , forgive my ignorance . " " You do n't have to beso ceremonious to him , May Li , " Wang Ta said , laughing . " He is a business god . He will not give you a  | long life unless you bribe him with big juicy peaches . " He took a peach from the offering plate on the table , wiped it with his hand , murmured an " excuse me " and then bit into the peach . May Li looked horrified . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , I often borrowed peaches from him , " Wang Ta said . " He wo n't mind . " He took another peach from the plate and offered it to May Li . " Come , have one on him , too . He wo n't mind . " May Li took the peach gingerly . " Do n't  --  do n't you believe in the god of longevity ? " " Sure , " Wang Ta said , eating the peach heartily . " My father always offered him the best fruits in the market . In China I ate them all . All this extra nourishment might have added a few years to my life . Do you like this clock ? It belonged to my mother . " May Li looked at the gold clock on the table , her eyes widening with admiration . " It is beautiful . Is it an offering to the god , too ? " Wang Ta laughed . " Oh , no ! A clock ticks time away and hastens people to their graves . How could the god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusted with it . But my mother was not so thoughtful ; she put it here for years , probably to remind the god of his duty . " " Where is your mother ? " May Li asked . " She died a few years ago . Sometimes it makes me wonder if she really offened the god of longevity . " May Li looked at the god and then at the clock . " Are you not going to remove it ? " " Well , this clock is our family treasure , " Wang Ta said . " Perhaps my father thinks this is the only safe place for it . ' Who dares to steal a gold clock right from under the nose of a god ? " " Is this a gold clock ? " " Yes . You may wind it . Probably it will be your daily routine from now on . " May Li touched the clock respectfully with a finger . " A gold clock ! I never touched gold in all my life . " " You are treating it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to wind this clock . " Wang Ta tossed the peach core onto the offering plate , picked up the clock and wound it carelessly . The ancient clock answered the rough treatment with a rattling sound and stopped . Wang Ta shook it a few times and then listened to it . " Has it stopped ? " May Li asked fearfully . " Dead as a rock , " Wang Ta said . He put the clock back on the table . " I shall repair it tomorrow . Doctoring sick men is my major study , repairing clocks is my sideline . Come , let me take you to a movie in Chinatown . " He took her hand and led her to the door . " Mr. Wang , " May Li said , still looking at the picture , " why do n't you believe in the god of longevity ? " " Oh , forget that funny face , " Wang Ta said . " I study modern medicine in the university . If I am good , I shall be a god of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of longevity can stop me from shortening people 's lives . Come , let me take you to a movie . " 6 During the past three weeks , May Li found life in the House of Wang very agreeable . Everybody in the house ate Chinese food , . spoke Chinese and did everything in typical Chinese ways except Wang San , who talked the foreign tongue and tossed an oliveshaped leather ball around that annoyed her a little . Yes , life here was just like that in China . Chinatown supplied everything  | the family needed except Old Mr. Wang 's water pipe tobacco , which had to be ordered in Hong Kong . She liked the Chinatown movies . She understood the Cantonese dialect and could follow their stories easily . The foreign movies were colorful and exciting but she seldom understood them . When she was seeing an American movie , she always missed the point of the funny talk . Each time the audience laughed , she often felt as though she had an itch but could n't reach it . She should have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the general had enjoyed speaking Chinese so much that he had never spoken a word of English to her . All she had leamed from him was how to drink ice-cold water and cow 's milk . When she thought of General ' White , she missed him . The old general was different from Old Mr. Wang ; he had often laughed and joked and eaten his meals heartily ; whereas Old Mr. Wang was always serious and stern-looking and had only a small appetite , and besides , he never drank cold water or cow 's milk . General ' White had liked to play Chinese checkers and take long walks ; Old Mr. Wang liked to practice his writing and take long afternoon naps . General White had enjoyed talking ; Old Mr. Wang seemed to enjoy coughing . One was so gay and the other so stern . She liked a gay old man better . She wondered who was older , General White or Old Mr. Wang . If Old Mr. Wang was older , she thought , it was apparent that the god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the House of Wang was just as light as that in the general 's house . Although Liu Ma often made her do things over again , still there was n't enough work to keep her happily busy . She loved to work . When she had nothing to do , she would come to the middle hall and shine Old Mr. Wang 's water pipe . It was a leisurely afternoon . Wang Ta and Wang San had not yet returned from their schools . Everybody else in the house was taking an afternoon nap . She came to the middle hall and shined Old Mr. Wang 's water pipe , humming merrily her favorite tune , the Feng-yong Flower Drum song .  | Old Man Li , who enjoyed life in the House of Wang just as much as did his daughter , came into the middle hall with a pail of water and a ladle . His face was beaming with happiness . " Oh , father , " May Li said , " did you not take a nap like everybody else ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have long to live , why should I waste it in bed ? I like to do a little housework to enjoy myself . Why do n't you take a nap ? " " I tried , but I could not fall asleep . I do n't know why the people in this house can sleep so easily . Like Old Mr. Wang , he starts snoring even before he reaches his bed . " " Well , we are different , " Old Man Li said , watering the orchids . " We were born different from the rich people . God makes the rich people enjoy the bed and makes us enjoy the food . " " Old Mr. Wang certainly does not eat much , " May Li said , shining the water pipe energetically . " Did you see him eat his dinner ? When he sees the delicacies , he always scowls . He always seems unhappy at the dinner table . You are never unhappy in your bed , are you , father ? " " Well , not if the bed has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : Content people are the happy ones . ' " He stopped watering the orchids and asked seriously , " Are you happy here , May Li ? " " Yes , I am ! " May Li said . " That is good ! " " I am happy except when I see Liu Ma , that old hag . " " Do n't have trouble with her , " Old Man Li said hastily ; " our ancient physiognomist has well said , A woman whose cheekbones are high and lips are sharp has a heart as poisonous as a rattlesnake . ' I noticed that Liu Ma has such features . What did she do to you ? " " She alwaysglares at me and snorts . " " Well , as long as she does not use her teeth and fingernails on you , do n't mind her . " " Her tongue is sharp , father . Yesterday when I was here shining Old Mr. Wang 's water pipe , she came and nagged me . She  | said , Who the turtle 's eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' I said , Why ca n't I sit on the kang ? ' She said , That is the Old Master 's seat ! ' I said , The Old Master is not here . ' She said , No servants are allowed to sit on the kang ! ' I said , I have sat on the kang many times with the young master , why did he not know this rule ? ' ... " " That is right , that is right , " Old Man Li said . " What did she say to that ? " " She said , Hum ! ' " " Well , you won the argument . But do n't have trouble with her any more , May Li . I am sure the ancient physiognomist wo n't be wrong about her cheekbones . Be good to her . Our sage has well said , Do n't sail against a storm , ' understand ? " " I shall try . " " Is Mr. Wang good to you ? " " Oh , yes , " May Li @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to teach me how to read and write the foreign language . " " Is he ? Ha , ha ! Good ! You study hard . It is a great thing to be able to read and write , no matter in what language , especially if you have a lover or a rotten relative who keeps writing to you . Shew ! I would have been more respected in China if I could read those classical letters from that crooked cousin of mine . Each time I asked somebody to read them to me , they thought I was crooked too , shew ! " May Li fished out a fountain pen from under her blouse and showed it to her father . " Mr. Wang also gave me this foreign pen . He said it has a small inkstand hidden in it . " Old Man Li examined the pen gingerly . " Ah , it is good of him to give you an expensive thing like this . You keep it carefully in your inside pocket and do n't use it too often . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wang study in the foreign university ? " " He studies how to be a doctor . Father , you should see how he writes that foreign language . He writes it so fast that you would think he is not writing , but drawing little worms on a piece of paper . "  | " I know , I know , " Old Man Li said . " This foreign language is strange . It looks different in writing . The foreign sailors often have the language tattooed on their arms . Ah , what a mess ! Some of the words look like women 's legs to me ! " May Li saw Wang Ta come in and she jumped up to her feet . " Mr. Wang , " she called excitedly . " Hello , " Wang Ta said , throwing a stack of books in a chair and himself in another . " Am I tired ! " He was tired , having rushed home from school . Ever since he had known May Li he had been rushing most of the time . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dull any more , and he was a changed man . " You are back early today , " Old Man Li said . " Seems to me it is not too hard to study to be a doctor . " " Short days , but long years , Old Man Li , " Wang Ta said , smiling . " Are you not going to take an afternoon nap , Mr. Wang ? " May Li asked . " I already had my nap in my class . " " Well , " Old Man Li said , " I certainly would n't mind studying to be a western doctor . But if I was ill , I certainly would not like to see one , shew ! " Wang Ta laughed . " When I get my diploma , Old Man Li , I certainly wo n't advise you to see me if you are ill . What have you been doing this afternoon , May Li ? " May Li handed him the Old Master 's water pipe . " Look ! " " What ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I changed the water , too . " " No wonder it even smells clean . You know , this pipe is as old as my brother Wang San . I must say this is the first time it has enjoyed a real shine since it came out of the factory . May Li , you are going to win my father 's favor faster than anybody else in this house . " " I like your father , " May Li said . " He looks so stem , but he never scolds anybody . " " He beats my brother , though , " Wang Ta said . " Are you his favorite son , Mr. Wang ? " May Li asked .  | " I have tried to be , but not too successfully . Whenever I ask him for something , he often has his mouth loaded with no 's ' and fires it at me like a machine gun . Old Man Li , my father is pleased with your work , too . He said the back yard is cleaner , the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Wang , " Old Man Li said , highly pleased , " flowers are just like human beings . You treat them well and they grow better and look fresher . Even those bloodthirsty dogs in China , they growl and show their teeth to everybody , but once you throw a bone at them , ha ! They will wag their tails to you thereafter . It is true of everything . " " It is not true of every human being , though , " Wang Ta said . " There are a lot of people who take advantage of a man 's kindness and make a fool of him . " " I call them bedbugs , " Old Man Li said . " They always explode under their benefactor 's body when they have sucked too much blood . " " Father , " May Li said , making a face , " you mention bedbugs every day  --  it is nauseating . " " Well , " Old Man Li said , " I have been their benefactor for more than sixty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old Man Li was pleased . He glanced at the young people and thought it was about time to leave them alone . " Well , " he said , taking up the water pail , " the flowers in the back yard are waiting for my water . " " You certainly love the flowers , Old Man Li , " Wang Ta said . " You will too , Mr. Wang , " Old Man Li said with a wink , " when you become my age and can not find anything better to love . " He cast May Li a quick glance , and hurried out of the middle hall , laughing . " Let us sit on the kang , " Wang Ta said , coming to the kang . " Are servants allowed to sit on the kang , Mr. Wang ? " May Li asked . " In this house you are allowed to do anything except call me mister all the time . "  | " I shall call you Young Master Wang Ta then , " May Li said , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you ever use that feudalistic title on me ! " Wang Ta said . " It stings my eardrums . I hate it so much that I do n't even mind trading it for Liu Lung 's title . " " What is Liu Lung 's title ? " " Deaf and Dumb Old Turtle . " May Li laughed . " What shall I call you then ? " " Call me Ta . Nobody in this house calls me Ta . That is why the atmosphere in this house is like that in an icehouse , and everybody here is like a hunk of frozen beef . " " All right , I shall call you Ta , " May Li said softly . Wang Ta looked at her and smiled , then he moved to her side of the kang . " Well , the barrier is gone . Do you like to work here , May Li ? " " Yes , Ta . " " You would like it much better if this was the old house in China . It was heavenly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bees and butterflies ; the young bamboo shoots grew a foot a day . . . wonder what happened to the old house now ... " He turned to the wall behind the kang and pointed at it . " See that space over there ? That was a huge moon-window facing the garden . Through it you could see the great big bamboos . " He lowered his head slightly and pretended to look up through an imaginary window . " Did you notice that basket , the basket that hangs on top of that tall bamboo ? " May Li was puzzled for a moment , then she smiled and pretended to look too . " Yes , I see it . How could anybody hang a basket that high ? " " I did . ' When I hung the basket on the bamboo , it was only ten feet high . Look at it now ; it has reached the sky . I used to sit here and watch the bamboos grow , especially the one with my basket carried on its top . Sometimes I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it finally went way beyond my reach . Somehow the basket became a symbol of my life 's goal , and yet  | time was taking it farther away from me . In those days I was a pretty sad fellow . In fact , I always was . . . until I met you . " He turned to look into May Li 's eyes . May Li lowered her head , blushing slightly . He quickly turned back to the wall and pointed at it again . " Do you see that ? " May Li pretended to look . " No . What is it ? " " The bamboo that was cut down . " " Oh , yes . Why was it cut down ? " " My brother , Wang San , was responsible for its execution . He imitated my ingenious doing by hanging a basket on it . He was only seven then , but he was a clever boy . He put two eggs in his basket . Do you know what happened ? Two wild pigeons came ; they made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were chicken eggs . When the pigeons found their babies growing so large , they were frightened away . My father discovered it and was frightened too . He thought the evil spirit must have invaded the garden . Who has ever heard of chickens raised on top of a bamboo ? He had the bamboo cut down , invited two Taoist priests home to send the evil spirit away , and then buried the chickens with a big funeral . Those two eggs cost him exactly two hundred thousand yuans , the value of a cow . " May Li laughed . " Why ? Did n't anybody tell him the truth ? " " I did . But it did not help much . He still believed in evil spirits . But Liu Lung and I had a good chicken dinner . He dug the birds out of their expensive graves and fried them in pure lard . Oh , heavens , they were delicious ! We ate them in the hills so Liu Ma could n't find us . " " Did n't you invite your brother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were his chickens . " " Yes , but Wang San had too m worries . My father almost lamed his legs for raising chickens on top of a bamboo . " He took out a bamboo stick from behind the kang and waved it in the air . " Do you know what this is ? This is called the Terror of Wang San . ' When my brother sees it , he trembles from his feet to his head . Give me your hand , let me show you how my father used to terrorize my brother . "  | May Li stretched out her right hand . Wang Ta held it with his left hand and pretended to beat it with the bamboo stick . " Ten strokes for stealing , fifteen strokes for failing to recite the Four Books of Confucius . " " How many strokes did he receive for raising chickens in the sky ? " May Li asked , laughing . " Twenty heavy strokes , " Wang Ta said , " not on his palm , but here . " He gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both laughed . Wang Ta put the stick away , but his hand still held hers . They looked at each other for a moment and suddenly May Li lowered her face , blushing . " I must go now , " she said , " Old Mr. Wang may come here to smoke his pipe . " " Do n't worry , " Wang Ta said . " He usually sleeps the whole afternoon , and sometimes it takes an extra hour for him to wake up . " He pulled her close . " You are very pretty , May Li . " May Li smiled and blushed profusely . " I must go now , really . " " Has any man held your hand before , May Li ? " Wang Ta asked . " Yes . " " Well , who was this scoundrel ? " " A Russian adviser . " " A Russian adviser ! Where did you meet this romantic Com-munist ? " " In a nightmare , " May Li said . " When I was in Formosa I dreamed I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real monster . " " Did you see a real Russian in a Russian picture ? " " No , I never saw a Russian picture . My father said back home everybody is seeing Russian pictures now . Did you see one ? " " Yes , I saw one in San Francisco . In that picture everybody is a hero . He works twenty hours a day , seven days a week . He salutes his comrades tirelessly . When orders come , he raises his arm and flag with a battle cry , dashes to the battlefield and dies . Have you seen many American pictures ? " " No , " May Li lied . " I never saw an American picture . " " Next time I shall take you to an American picture . They are  | different from the Cantonese pictures we have seen in Chinatown . In an American movie , everybody has a beautiful car ; in every car there is a beautiful woman . And the heroes do n't die so often , as the Chinese heroes do . Sometimes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up the whole thing with a long kiss . You know what a long kiss is , do n't you ? " " No , " May Li lied again . " Well , " Wang Ta said laughing , " perhaps you are the only person on American soil who does not know what a kiss is . Well , let me explain it to you . A kiss is  --  it is  --  a touch or press of the lips ? on the lips or the cheeks or  --  well , it is much easier to do than to explain . Anyway , press your lips anywhere you choose , but with a feeling of strong personal attachment induced by sympathetic understanding  --  or by ties of kinship  --  or by ardent affection or ... " He paused , looked at her intently . " Do you understand ? " " No , " May Li said . " I know you do n't , " Wang Ta said . " Well , I shall explain it in a simpler way . Physically a kiss is a  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loved by everybody in the Western countries , especially in America . Do you know what action is ? " " No , " May Li said . " Oh , you are hopeless . All right , I shall show it to you . Close your eyes . " May Li closed her eyes . Wang Ta raised her chin a little and went on , " Yes , raise your head and relax your lips . . . that 's right . . . just like a little crack on a pomegranate . That 's right . " Then he held her with both his hands and planted a gentle kiss on her lips . May Li opened her eyes quickly and asked , " Is this a kiss ? " " Yes , " Wang Ta said , smiling , " but compared with the kisses you see in an American movie , this is only half-done . " " Only half-done ? " " Yes , only half-done . Let me take you to an American movie . They will show you how it is well-done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , now . We 'll be back in time for dinner . " He took her hand and dragged her out . 7 Madam Tang has not been quite successful in arguing with her brother-in-law that he should accept Mr. Loo 's dinner invitation , let alone persuade him to accept one of Mr. Loo 's daughters as a prospective daughter-in-law . She wondered why the old man had become so stubborn . She had successfully made him deposit all of his cash in the bank and tricked him into buying a suit of Western clothes which he loathed , but inducing him to eat Mr. Loo 's dinner seemed to be almost impossible . Her failure in this errand bothered her a great deal . Besides suffering a personal defeat , she would also lose face in front of Mr. Loo , and above all , it would be a great shame if Mr. Loo 's second daughter should fall into the hands of that good-for-nothing playboy son of that Szechuan ex-warlord . The girl was just right for Wang Ta . When she thought of all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It puzzled her a little why Wang Chi-yang was getting more hard-boiled . She analyzed the situation and decided that it had something to do with the rearrangement of the furniture in that middle hall . Her sister 's old spirit was back in the house . It must have boosted Wang Chi-yang 's courage  | and stubbornness . If she wanted to influence the old man perhaps she should change her tactics from now on . She knew that Wang Chi-yang was an uprightoldturtle despite all his weaknesses . He was never greedy , and had always been indifferent to fortune and fame . But he had a great respect for scholastic achievement . All through his life he had admired nobody but great scholars and poets . Then she remembered that Mr. Loo had written some poems during those jobless days when he had been supported by his three daughters . She understood that he was still writing poems occasionally after four hours ' humiliating work at a restaurant as a cashier . She wondered how many poems the ex-mayor of Hang Chow had written . If there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . She picked up her phone and called Mr. Loo at his house . " Yes , I have written thousands of them , " Mr. Loo told her , " but my wife has been using my poems to wrap her flower seeds and has burned some to build fires in the fireplace . " " Please write more and salvage those which your wife has not yet burned , " Madam Tang said . " I can find a publisher for you . I know a Chinatown newspaper publisher who is interested in publishing a collection of Chinese poems . Please have the manuscript ready . " After Madam Tang had finished talking to Mr. Loo she sent for a Yellow cab , and within twenty minutes she was in the heart of Chinatown talking to one of the newspaper publishers . The publisher was n't interested in publishing any collection of poems but his paper was doing some printing business on the side . For three hundred dollars he could print a thousand copies of anything of pamphlet size . Madam Tang had no time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her checkbook and signed a check for five hundred dollars . " Please pay Mr. Loo two hundred for his poems , " Madam Tang said , handing the publisher the check . " Tell him it is your money , please , and send somebody to pick up the poems and have them printed within a week . Here is Mr. Loo 's address . "  | The publisher accepted the check with a dubious scowl but it was business for the firm and he did n't want to be too inquisitive about the strange deal . It might be a birthday present for Mr. Loo or some such thing , he thought . The taxi was waiting . Madam Tang got back into it and told the driver Wang Chi-yang 's address . She was fighting a war and she could n't afford losing precious time . When she entered the middle hall in the House of Wang , Liu Ma seemed to be very pleased to see her ; she looked as though she had great news to report . " How are you , Madam Tang ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tang said . " Has the Old Master gotten out of his bed ? " " Not yet , " Liu Ma said , " but he will soon . I heard him cough a moment ago . " " Tell him I have come to see him , " Madam Tang said . " Yes , madam , " Liu Ma said , starting for Wang Chi-yang 's bedroom , but at the door she halted . She must first tell Madam Tang of what she had seen . If she told the Old Master first , the story might be different when the Old Master repeated it . The story was something roof-shaking and she did n't want anybody but herself to tell it to Madam Tang . She hurried back to Madam Tang and whispered emphatically , " Madam , do you know what I saw this afternoon ? " " How could I know ? " Madam Tang said . " What is it ? " " I saw them hold hands ! " " Who hold hands ? " Madam Tang asked , slightly irritated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ! " " May five thunderbolts strike me dead if I lie , madam . I saw Young Master Wang Ta hold the girl 's hand and the girl hold his , right in this room ! " She leaned closer to Madam Tang , lowered her voice further and added , " If you had come an hour earlier , madam , you would have seen something else too . " " I was busy , " Madam Tang said . " What else did you see ? " " I saw them doing this ! " Liu Ma said . Finding it difficult to describe what she had seen while hiding behind a door , she en-  | acted the scene with her two hands representing the two lovers . She put her two fists together and went on . " The Young Master told the girl to close her eyes and raise her head , then he held her in his arms and pressed his head on hers like this ! " She exaggerated the kiss by rubbing her fists together . " What is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , madam , " Liu Ma said . " Young Master Wang Ta said it was only half-done . " " Half-done ? " Madam Tang asked . " What half-done ? " " I do n't know . They went out an hour ago . But I am sure they are hiding somewhere doing the other half now ! " " Incredible , incredible ! " Madam Tang said , fanning herself with a handkerchief . " Ask the Old Master to come out quickly ! " " Yes , madam , " Liu Ma said . Having started for Wang Chiyang 's door she suddenly halted and whispered again . " Madam , I am sure that beggar maid knows some sorcery . She must have bewitched the Young Master . " " Oh , nonsense . Ask the Old Master to come ! " " It is true , madam . That old man looks just as dangerous . Sometimes I suspect that he attempts to seduce me too , but I told him that he was an old frog wishing to eat the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master to come here ! " Madam Tang interrupted her angrily , waving her handkerchief in disgust . Wang Chi-yang had been lying in his huge bed , resting and enjoying a moment 's mild coughing . When he heard his sister-inlaw 's angry voice in the middle hall , he closed his eyes and waited for the relative 's unavoidable intrusion into his world of peace and quiet . Presently he heard Liu Ma come in . " Old Master , " Liu Ma called hesitantly beside his bed . Old Master Wang opened his eyes and asked , " What is it ? " " Madam Tang is here to see you , " Liu Ma said . " She has something important to tell you . " She came closer to the mosquito net and whispered , " Old Master , do you know what I saw ... " " You can tell me what you saw while you beat my shoulders  | tonight , " Wang Chi-yang said . " Tell Madam Tang that I shall see her in the middle hall in a few moments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled out of the mosquito net , seated himself in a rattan chair , wiped his face with both hands and grunted and groaned for a moment , then he got up and went to the bathroom to wash his hands and rinse his mouth . He wondered what his sister-in-law had to tell him . He hoped that she had n't come to talk about Mr. Loo 's dinner invitation again . Never in his life had he been so persistently urged by someone to eat someone else 's dinner . The more his sister-in-law urged him , the more reluctant he became to eat that dinner . It seemed to him that eating Mr. Loo 's dinner would be like accepting a bribe and surrendering his principles . No , he thought , he can not yield an inch in this matter . If she brings up the subject again , he must tell her once and for all that he will not accept Mr. Loo 's invitation . He took his time washing his hands and rinsing his mouth , then spent another ten minutes trimming his mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fanning herself impatiently with her little handkerchief as though she had been sitting on a hot stove for half an hour . " My sister 's husband , " she said , leaping to her feet . " Something terrible has happened ! " Wang Chi-yang coughed , sat down on the kang and picked up his water pipe . " What is it ? " he asked quietly . " My sister 's husband , " Madam Tang said , waving her handkerchief at him , " do not tell me that I did not warn you when you employed that old man and his daughter . I have just come to this house with good news , but now this good news is all shadowed by a great misfortune that old man and his daughter have brought into your house ! " " Hm , humph , " Old Master Wang said , filling his pipe with tobacco . He rather liked Old Man Li and his daughter . He could n't see why his sister-in-law was so peevish while talking about them . " Hm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his daughter . What have they done ? "  | " That girl and Wang Ta were making love , " Madam Tang said . " Right in this room ! " " Nonsense , nonsense . " " It is true ! Liu Ma saw it with her own eyes ! They were holding hands and  --  and  --  Liu Ma , show the Old Master what they did in this room ! " " Yes , madam . They were doing this , Old Master ! " With her hands Liu Ma enacted the kissing scene , which Old Master Wang watched with a deep scowl . " All right , you may go now , " Madam Tang said . " Yes , madam . " After Liu Ma had left , Madam Tang turned to Wang Chi-yang and said gravely , " My sister 's husband , I presume that you understand what Liu Ma 's gestures mean . Please let me remind you , if they can do that in the daytime , can you imagine what they can do at night ? This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang Chi-yang mumbled , controlling his anger . " Just imagine your own son , " Madam Tang said , " making love to a maidservant . What will Chinatown think of this family if this horrible scandal spreads ? " " I told you . Wang Ta has been under bad influence ever since he started associating with women of bad reputation . Now he has started seducing innocent girls . " " I-Iow do you know it is not that lewd wench who has been seducing Wang Ta ? " " That girl is a hard-working country lass , " Wang Chi-yang said . " If it is a matter of seduction , Wang Ta is undoubtedly the initiator ! " " Let us not argue about who started it , " Madam Tang said . " Right now you are facing a danger which could cut you barren of descendants . Who is going to marry their daughters into this house if the family is stained by such a scandalous affair ? " " I know , I know , " Old Master Wang said , looking worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with good news . Mr. Loo has just had his poems published by one of the leading publishers in  | Chinatown . The publisher said Mr. Loo is one of the most out , standing Chinese poets he has had the honor to associate with in recent years . Many scholars have read his poems and all agreed with him . And Mr. Loo has been kind enough to promise me a few copies of the poems and has asked me to present you with a copy . Wang Ta had an excellent chance to marry the daughter of such a great scholar ; now everything is ruined . " " My wife 's sister , " Wang Chi-yang said , his stubbornness deflating like a balloon , " I begin to believe that under the modern influence , the young people can never keep themselves clean and pure as we did . Their virtues are low . In order to avoid any further defamatory catastrophe , I admit that it is wise to have Wang Ta married as soon as possible . " " What did I tell you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy making a match for him ? Your indifferent attitude has been very discouraging , but my concern for Wang Ta 's future has never been thwarted ! " " Let us get down to business , my wife 's sister , " Old Master Wang said . " Do you think that Mr. Loo will consider marrying off his second daughter first ? " " Why not ? " Madam Tang retorted . " Must all his other daughters become old maids if the eldest can not find a husband ? Mr. Loo is a wise man ; he knows better ! " " But , " Wang Chi-yang said pensively , " girls should be married in the right order . Mr. Loo , being a poet and scholar , might object to this disorderly marriage . " Suddenly he looked at his sisterin-law anxiously and asked , " My wife 's sister , if he insists on the correct order , is his oldest daughter good enough to be con-sidered ? " " No ! " Madam Tang said firmly . " The oldest one has studied art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows if she is still a virgin ? The third daughter is too pretty and too foxy . That type of woman never makes a good wife . She can win her husband to her side and fight his own parents . Only the second daughter is ideal , as I told you before ... " " Please go to see Mr. Loo tomorrow and tell him that I have  | the desire to see Wang Ta properly married before he inherits my property . See if he would honor us by marrying his second daughter to our family . " " Tomorrow will be too late , " Madam Tang said . " I am going to talk to him today . But first we shall find a go-between , find somebody whose prestige is high in Chinatown . The president of the Six Companies will be an ideal man . Or Dr. Ling , the history professor at the University of California ... " " We shall ask Dr. Ling to be the go-between , " Wang Chi-yang said hastily . " I have always wanted to meet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madam Tang said . " Then we shall buy two fat geese as the engagement present . After Dr. Ling has proposed the match formally , I shall go to Mr. Loo 's house with the geese . All this should be done within a week . " " Hm , humph , " Old Master Wang said , smoothing his mustache pensively , " do n't you think , my wife 's sister , do n't you think this is a little too hasty ? " " My sister 's husband , think of the danger ! If that maidservant boasts of her romance in Chinatown , the whole thing will be ruined . I shall never have a day of peace unless Wang Ta is officially engaged to some decent girl from a good family . The more I think of it , the more urgent it seems . " She grabbed her handbag and rose from the kang . " My sister 's husband , let us go to see Dr. Ling . " Old Master Wang also rose , nodding his head . " Have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and called Liu Lung . " Do not call Liu Lung , " Madam Tang said hastily . " Ca n't you remember that he is deaf ? " " Old Man Li , " Wang Chi-yang called . " That old man is a bad omen , " Madam Tang said . " Come on , my sister 's husband , let us go to the street and get a taxi ourselves . " " Have your way , " Wang Chi-yang said , putting on his black satin cap that had hung on a nail beside the kang . Just as they were about to leave the house , Liu Lung and Old Man Li hurried in . " Did you call us , Old Mr. Wang ? " Old Man Li asked .  | " Never mind , " Wang Chi-yang said . " We are going out . " Madam Tang turned to Liu Lung and shouted , " Liu Lung , when you see your wife , tell her not to talk , do you hear ? " " En  --  n ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut ! " she shouted . " Ah ? " " Oh , my sister 's husband , why is this man getting more deaf every day ! Oh , we are busy . Let us go . " After Madam Tang and Old Master Wang had left the house , Liu Lung turned to Old Man Li with a puzzled look . " What did she want ? " he asked . " She wanted your wife to keep her large mouth shut ! " Old Man Li shouted into his ear . " Oh , " Liu Lung said , nodding his head . " That is good , but hard . " Both laughed . " Well , " Old Man Li said , " I wonder what has happened in this house today . Everybody looks so busy and excited . Where is your wife , Liu Lung ? " " My wife ? I do n't know . Maybe she is taking a nap . That is the only time she keeps her mouth shut . " " Quite true , Liu Lung , " Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you take afternoon naps , too ? " " Me ? Sleep beside my wife in the daytime ? Bah ! Is not the night long enough ? " " You are right , Liu Lung , " Old Man Li said , laughing harder . " I sympathize with you . Shew , she is quite a wife ! Well , everybody is out , it is a good time to enjoy a moment of peace and quiet . We might as well sit down here and have a drink together . What do you say , Liu Lung ? " " En  --  n ? " Old Man Li fished out his flask from his pocket and patted it affectionately . " Our common hobby , get it ? " he shouted . " Oh , oh ! " Liu Lung said , smiling . " Sure , sure ! " Both went to the kang and sat down . Liu Lung loosened his flask from his belt while Old Man Li dug out a parcel of peanuts from his pocket . He put it on the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They drank and ate the peanuts and  | Iooked very happy . " You know , Liu Lung , " Old Man Li said , " a man must have some hobby if he wants to live his life happily . " " En  --  n ? " " I say , if you want to be happy , you must find something to love . Like children , they love candy ; like young fellows , they love women ; like middle-aged people , they love money ; like old men , they love peace and quiet and a drink of this . " He patted his flask again . " That is hobby , get it ? " " I see , I see , " Liu Lung said , nodding his head incessantly , then with a broad smile he confided , " Old Man Li , at my age , I love everything but candy ! " " You are right , " Old Man Li said laughing . " You are right , Liu Lung . That is a very frank talk ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell you the truth , Liu Lung , if I had two more good teeth , even candy would not be too disagreeable in my mouth , get it ? " Both leaned back and roared with laughter . " Come , come , have another drink . " They toasted each other and drank from their flasks deeply . Liu Ma burst into the middle hall with a snort . She planted herself in front of the petrified men and glared at them for a moment , her arms akimbo . " What are you two doing here ? " she demanded . In consternation , the two men tried to hide their flasks awkwardly . " Oh , oh , " Old Man Li said , " we are enjoying a little joke together , that is all , that is all . " " You lie ! " Liu Ma said . " I smell the stench of bad liquor . Liu Lung , did you drink again ? Speak up , you scoundrel ! Did you touch somebody else 's dirty liquor again ? " Liu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liu Ma , " Old Man Li said , " he is selfsupporting . " " What ? Did you buy liquor yourself , you drunkard ? " Liu Ma asked her husband . " Give me the liquor . Give it to me , I said ! " Liu Lung handed his flask to his wife timidly . " Here . " " Hum ! " Liu Ma said , snatching the flask from his hand . " You  | hide it from me , eh ? Where did you get the money to buy it ? " " I go sleep in the basement , en  --  n ? " Liu Lung said . " Oh , scramble out ! " Liu Ma said furiously . " Scramble out of here ! Never come near me again ! " Liu Lung quickly got up from the kang and fled the room . Liu Ma turned to Old Man Li and demanded , " Where is your daughter , old man ? " " I have been looking for her myself , " Old Man Li said . " Wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone ? " Liu Ma said with a snort . " She has eloped with the Young Master . I have been looking for them everywhere and I can not even find their shadows . Let me warn you , old man , if they do not return by evening , the Old Master will charge you with kidnapping the Young Master ! " " I kidnap the Young Master ? Oh , heaven has eyes ! What makes you talk like a crazy woman ? " " If you did not , your daughter did ! " Liu Ma said . " They have disappeared , that is true ! She has seduced him , she has bewitched him , that is true ! " " I am going to find them , " Old Man Li said , starting for the front door . " I shall show you what kind of girl my daughter is . If she is a kidnapper , I shall ask your Old Master to throw me into the foreign jail . I shall let my flesh and bones rot in jail until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door angrily . Liu Ma threw herself on the kang , nursing her rage , then she put her husband 's flask to her mouth and took a long drink from it . Suddenly an idea came to her mind . Slowly her eyes traveled toward the gold clock on the table ... .  | Wang Ta regretted that he had taken May Li to his school before they went to the movie . He had thought of educating her a little by showing her what he had been studying , but after May Li had seen a few limbs and other sections of the human body soaked in a tank , she could n't enjoy the movie . All through the first feature , she covered her mouth with her handkerchief and made little noises that annoyed Wang Ta . He went out and bought a pack of chewing gum and gave it to her . " Chew one of these , " he advised . " It will help . " The chewing gum did n't help . Before the show was over they left the theater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were seasick . In desperation , Wang Ta went into a grocery store and bought a package of chili peppers , tore it open , and handed a small red-hot pepper to her ; May Li chewed it and soon tears started welling out of her eyes . " Feel better ? " " Yes , " she said , sucking air into her mouth to cool her burned tongue . " Now , try this , " Wang Ta said , giving her the chewing gum . When they got into the car , May Li was normal again . " I am hungry , " she said . " Since you did not enjoy the movie , " Wang Ta said , " I shall compensate for it by taking you to a foreign dinner and then to a foreign place to watch dancing . " He drove her to Van Ness Avenue and wondered whether he should take her to the Chicken House or to the Steak House . Both were his favorite restaurants . Thinking that cutting a bloody steak might remind her of the dismembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take her to the Chicken House . May Li liked the foreign meal except the ice cream , which she ate with her brows knitted and she made faces when she swal-  | lowed . " What is the matter ? " Wang Ta asked . " Do n't you like ice cream ? " " Too cold , " she said , shivering . " Well , your tongue has suffered enough today , " Wang T'a said , rising . " Let 's go somewhere and see a good live show . " " I think I should go back now , " May Li said . " Your father might have work for me to do . " " Get this straight , May Li , " Wang Ta said . " This is America . You only work eight hours a day , and there is no more work after dinner . When did you start working this morning ? " " Six . " " We came out at two-thirty . You worked eight and a half hours already . According to law , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . Come , I shall take you to the Italian Village to see a night-club show . Have you ever been to a night club ? " " No . What is a night club ? " " You will see . " After Wang Ta had paid the bill , he discovered that he had only two dollars left . Instead of taking her to the Italian Village where two dollars was only enough for tips , he took her to William Tell in a dark section on Clay Street . He had been to the place with Chang a few times before and each time they had seldom spent more than two dollars . He liked its friendly and cosmopolitan atmosphere and always had plenty of exercise dancing in that spacious hall . He and May Li went through the bar and entered the dance hall that somehow always reminded him of a drained swimming pool . A waitress escorted them to a table covered with white-andred-checked cloth and Wang Ta ordered a beer and a Coke . A three-piece band  --  an accordion , a piano and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could a ten-man band . People who talked different languages or English with an accent started arriving . Three colorfully dressed couples were waltzing ; they looked like Dutch in their native costumes and yet  | they waltzed like Viennese , whirling around in the hall swiftly and gracefully , their heads tilted slightly to one side . " Is this a show ? " May Li asked , watching the dancing couples excitedly . " No , " Wang Ta said . " They are customers like us . " " They are different from the foreigners we see on the street , " May Li said . " They are foreign foreigners , " Wang Ta said . Sitting at a small round table beside them was a little man with deep well-like eyes and a balding head . He was wiping his enormous forehead with a large handkerchief and at the same time scanning the horizon trying to select his next dancing partner . At another table nearby were a group of people talking French and laughing loudly ; a red-faced Frenchman with a beard was doing most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his handsome eyes rolling ; a slim young girl beside him looked at him with dreamy eyes , her hand on his muscular thigh . " Look , " May Li said excitedly , pointing at the dance floor where the dancers were racing around now , leaping , turning , stamping , their hands stretching over their heads at one moment and resting on their hips at another ; sometimes the girls ' skirts flew up and spread like an umbrella , baring their shapely legs . The music was louder and faster , with a heavy and delightful beat . May Li watched the dance , fascinated . Presently more people joined the dance and the dance floor became a battlefield of violent action of rhythm and cheer . When the music was over , the little man at the next table returned , sweating and wiping his enormous forehead ; the French people were still talking and laughing , ignoring the people on the dance floor completely ; the slim girl with the dreamy eyes was now nesting in the bearded Frenchman 's arms , her head resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his muscular thigh . A whiff of strong perfume came from the next table . Wang Ta sniffed and noticed that the little man with the enormous forehead was wetting a forefinger with perfume from a little jar . He  | dabbed the perfume behind his ears and in the meantime scanned the horizon trying to pick his next dancing partner . Suddenly there was a familiar voice shouting Wang Ta 's name . He looked and saw Chang and a girl emerging from the crowd on the dance floor . They came toward his table hurriedly . Wang Ta greeted Chang as he shot up to his feet , almost upsetting the table . " What wind has blown you here ? " he yelled at Chang in Mandarin . " Why did n't you let me know that you have come ? " Chang arrived at the table with the girl , who was young and pretty , with large sparkling eyes and dark complexion . " First , let me introduce my wife , " Chang said in English . " This is my wife Dolores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li to them and invited them to sit down . Then he ordered more drinks . " You certainly like to surprise people , " he said . " ' Why did n't you tell me that you are mar-ried ? " " Just got married a week ago , " Chang said . " Too busy enjoying my honeymoon to write . " " When did you come to San Francisco ? " Wang Ta asked . " This afternoon . Flew in from Reno . Called you three times after I arrived  --  once at the airport , once in our hotel , and once at the Far East Restaurant while waiting for our dinner . Nobody in your house knew where you 've disappeared to . I 've thought of looking for you at the police station . " He glanced at May Li and laughed . " Now I do n't blame you for not staying at home , and I do n't have to ask you how life is treating you , your eyes are telling me everything . " " You look well , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been treating you very well . " " Could n't be better . " Chang slid a hand through his wife 's long black wavy hair , held the back of her neck and shook it gently . " Here 's the proof . " The Mexican girl gave Chang 's arm an affectionate squeeze and laughed , " You talk wonderful , " she said . " Wo ai chi . " " She means I love you , ' but it sounds like I am gluttonous , ' "  | Chang said , laughing . " She has been learning Chinese . The Spanish accent makes our language sound more musical , but a bit harder to understand . " " How long are you going to stay here ? " Wang Ta asked . " Going back tomorrow morning . That 's why I 've kept calling you . Lucky we met here . " " It 's heaven 's will that we should see each other tonight , " Wang Ta said cheerfully . " If I had five more dollars in my pocket , we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' What 's wrong with San Francisco ? " " Business appointment , " Chang said . " I 'm buying a grocery store . A small business , but I 'm going to build it up . Excellent location , near the Mexican colony . Do n't forget , I 'm now a grocery expert , with a Ph.D degree . In ten years I 'll have a supermarket , in twenty years I 'll have a grocery chain , and in thirty years . . . well , in thirty years I 'll be an old goat about seventyfive . " He shook his wife 's neck and laughed . The Mexican girl squeezed his arm and said , " In thirty years you be a tired man with a young wife , no ? " " You mean a retired man with a young wife . " " No . I mean tired . " " All right , tired , " Chang said , laughing . " If you insist on simplifying the English language , I am with you . " " Wo ai chi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little man at the next table came over , clicked his heels and bowed stiffly to May Li and asked her for a dance . Wang Ta told May Li what the man wanted and urged her to dance . " That 's a German , " Chang said in Chinese after May Li had left the table . " Perfectly harmless . Here all you have to avoid is a Frenchman . " No sooner had he made the remark than a Frenchman came from the other table and asked Chang 's wife for a dance . ' Wang Ta had never laughed so hard and Chang shrugged his shoulders . " I have nothing to complain about , " Chang said . " It shows that our girls are hot commodities here . If you sit here with your wife or girl friend for two hours without a soul paying her any attention , somehow your pride is hurt . " He gulped down a mouthful of beer  | and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand , which , to Wang Ta 's surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you go into the grocery business with me ? This is a business country . I firmly believe that our real future can only be built in business . " " I have no capital , " Wang Ta said . " Your honesty is your capital . I need a partner like you . " " A month ago I would have jumped at this offer , " Wang Ta said . " But not now . Thank you just the same . " " Why ? Have you decided to stick it out with your medical study ? " " Yes . I begin to find it interesting , " Wang Ta said , smiling . Chang studied him . " You certainly are changed . And you 've learned how to laugh , too . I never heard you laugh like that before . It 's a change for the better , I must say . And I think I know why . " He jerked his head toward the dance floor . " Where did you meet her ? " Wang Ta told him the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her father . " She is a life-saving shot in my arm , " Wang Ta added ; " she seems to be a kind of incentive , giving me a new interest in life . Recently I was surprised at the change myself , but I am awfully glad of it . Tell me how you got married . " " I gratefully attribute my marriage to two things , " Chang said ; " first , the unfriendly attitude of the Immigration Service ; secondly , the bad habit of a neighbor . A riddle , is n't it ? Let me explain . " He downed another mouthful of beer and lighted a cigarette . " Some Immigration investigators or inspectors , " he went on , " completely ignorant of our problems , seem to have the tendency to think that all bachelor aliens over forty are homosexuals . In order to have my immigration status adjusted , I decided to prove to them that I 'm a normal human being , just as anxious to get married as they are to get rid of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would marry me , no questions asked . A complete unconditional surrender . You know , the case was getting pretty urgent . I wanted to have my own business and settle down ; in order to achieve that you must first have the Immigra-  | tion officers ' blessing , otherwise you 're building your castle on sand . To us aliens , they are the High Lamas in this land . " He paused , took a drink and went on . " Then suddenly my neighbor 's bad habit came to my aid . He was a carpenter , but had the luxurious bad habit of not talking to his wife . When warm , he read the paper and the funnies over and over ; when cold he stood for hours over the floor heater in the living room , his legs apart , his hands behind his back , rocking and enjoying having the lower part of his body thoroughly baked ... " " He still could talk to his wife , could n't he ? " Wang Ta asked . " No . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make him give up one of the pleasures and devote a little time to his wife , but no , he worked hard , he wanted his pleasures . So his wife , to revenge herself , spent all her waking hours on the telephone , talking to anybody , just anybody who had given her a phone number . It irritated me infinitely . " " I do n't see how that would irritate you . Are the walls too thin ? " " No . It happened that her phone was my party line . I never had a chance to make a call or receive a call except after midnight . Finally , I pleaded with the phone company to have my party line changed . The phone company obliged . This new party line was never busy . I was completely satisfied , wondering who shared it ; maybe somebody who has been vacationing somewhere , or maybe a traveling salesman , away from his abode nine days out of ten . One day I was talking to a friend on the phone , suddenly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice with a Spanish accent  --  asking me politely if I would be kind enough to hang up and let her make an emergency call . Her mother was seriously ill . Well , I was very neighborly . I made the emergency call for her , and one thing led to another , and within a week we became close friends , and you know the rest of the story . " " That 's fate , " Wang Ta said . " You may call it fate , " Chang said . " We have a word for it in China  --  yuan . Remember the old saying ? If you have the right yuan , you come a thousand miles to meet the right girl ; if you do n't have the right yuan , you wo n't know each other even if you  | come face to face with each other . But sometimes providence uses the most intriguing , the most unpredictable method to bring people together . I think my yuan was a pretty strange one . But an excellent one , for now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world  --  cheerful , hard-working , affectionate , and above all , treating her mother extremely well . That 's Chinese , you know . I still believe that filial piety is a necessary virtue , especially in a woman . If a woman ca n't love her own mother , how can you expect her to love anybody else ? " He jerked his head toward the dance floor . " How about her , do you expect to marry her ? " " I have n't thought of it yet , " Wang Ta said . " It all depends on my yuan . " " And hers , too , " Chang said . " Like you and Linda Tung and Helen Chao , you just did n't have the right yuan . By the way , do you know where Linda Tung is ? " " No . I 've never thought of her again after I stopped being her brother . ' " " She has free-lanced to Los Angeles , " Chang said . " Apparently San Francisco Chinatown has expelled her . I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different now . The great change is that she never looks at you when you talk to her . She always gives you the profile . " . " Why ? Ashamed of herself ? " " No , just the opposite . My friend said that some painter told her she had a profile like that of a Greek beauty . Ever since that comment , she has been giving people her Greek ' profile . " Wang Ta laughed . " Does she know what Greek means ? " " Apparently not . Her nose needs at least five more ounces of meat to look Greek . Anyway , she is pretty popular at the moment , and has acquired a couple of new brothers . ' " " They have my sympathy , " Wang Ta said , laughing . They talked and had more beer until Chang 's wife and May Li were escorted back to the table by their dancing partners . Both girls were perspiring . May Li had enjoyed the dance ; it was an exciting experience to her . " How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " He smells good , " May Li said . " I know , " Wang Ta said , laughing . " If you were a little shorter , you would breathe behind his ear and get knocked out by that perfume . " " Is the Frenchman a wolf ? " Chang asked his wife . " He no wolf , " Dolores said . " He gentleman . He dance good , too . " " That 's worse than a wolf , " Chang said . They ordered more drinks , talked and laughed and danced until midnight . When they were saying good-bye in the street , Chang put a hand on Wang Ta 's shoulder and said seriously , " In case you change your mind , remember that my offer still stands . " " I 'll remember it , " Wang Ta said . " But I doubt that I 'll ever change my mind . " " Well , good luck . " After they had parted , Wang Ta took May Li 's hand and walked toward the car quietly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car he took May Li 's hand again . " Are you happy ? " he asked . " Yes , very happy , " May Li said . " You know , when I think of how we met , I believe that it is the yuan that has brought us together . It started with General White 's death . " " Why ? " " Well , if General White had n't died , your father would n't have thought of opening a restaurant in San Francisco Chinatown ; if he had n't thought of opening a restaurant , he would n't have gone to see the consul general , and the consul general would n't have written that letter of recommendation , to Mr. Poon of Peking , and consequently you would n't have come to our door and we would n't have met at all . So you see , everything was cleverly prearranged by heaven . It is yuan . " " Yes , it is yuan , " May Li said softly . Wang Ta took her into his arms and kissed her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .  | May Li took a deep breath , put her head on Wang Ta 's shoul ' der and said , " I like it well-done. " 9 It was after midnight when Liu Ma returned to her room . From under her blouse she brought out the gold clock and then glanced at her husband who was snoring noisily in their double bed . She put the clock down , went to the bed and sat down . She must let her husband know that their security was being threatened by Old Man Li and his daughter . If she and Liu Lung lost their jobs , they certainly would become beggars in this strange country where they had no friends or relatives . She must do everything to remove the threat and have Liu Lung take active part in her scheme . " Liu Lung , " she called softly , shaking his shoulder . Liu Lung stopped snoring , snorted and swallowed , then he rubbed his eyes , smacked his lips and grunted drowsily . " En  --  n , en  --  n ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered heavily into his ear , " listen carefully ! I have something for you to do . It is important . " Liu Lung winced and picked his ear with a forefinger . " Do what ? " he asked after a loud yawn . " We are going to get rid of that old beggar and his daughter ! " " Why ? " Liu Lung asked after a moment , puzzled .
