The Democratic tradition of a solid South runs deep in the heart of Texas . Only twice-in 1928 ( Hoover ) and 1952 ( Eisenhower ) - has the state gone Republican in a national election . But during the long Roosevelt reign , party rebels rose like bluebonnets in the spring . An anti-Administration faction formed as early as 1936 , and in subsequent presidential years there were others : in 1940 those who opposed a third F.D.R. term , in 1944 the " Regulars , " in 1948 the " Dixiecrats , " and in 1952 the " Shivercrats . " Of all these infidels , only the Shivercrats committed the cardinal party sin : they helped send a Republican to the White House . <P> Scapegoat at Hand . In his hour of heretical glory three years ago , Texas Governor Allan Shivers stood tall in the political saddle . Politically , the big state of Texas lay in his pocket . But despite the wave of Eisenhowerism , Texas remained solidly Democratic . No one understood this better than rebel Shivers , as he watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Sam Rayburn , Speaker of the House ( and single head of the Texas faithful , now that illness has removed Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson from the arena ) , the Democratic loyalists gathered in new vigor to nibble at Shivers ' empire . <P> In 1954 Shivers managed election to an unprecedented third term as governor , but the going was not easy . A ripe array of administrative scandals have erupted , e.g. , the Houston grain scandal and the veterans ' land mess ( see-below ) . Although none of these implicated the governor personally , they were laid at his door . And at the start of his seventh year as governor , lanky Allan Shivers finds himself in the awkward role of the man who came to dinner . As one Dallas Democrat put it : " He 's stayed too damn long . " <P> Shivers is not expected to seek another term ; but he vastly enjoyed leading Texas ' delegation ( 52 votes ) to the 1952 convention , and he hopes to lead the delegation in 1956 . But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apostate . Clearly , Shivers ' salvation lay in repentance before Sam . <P> This called for a scapegoat , and there was one handy : National Committeeman Wright Francis Morrow , the silver-haired , wealthy Houston attorney who , arm in arm with Shivers , helped guide the rebellion of ' 52 . Morrow was as far out of favor as Shivers ; for two years the national committee had steadfastly denied him a seat . <P> Successor to Come . With a show of pious reluctance , Governor Shivers broke the sad news to Morrow : he had better resign . Morrow recalled what Shivers told him : " It 's pure politics , Wright ; I need Rayburn 's help . " Morrow stubbornly refused , and the governor hustled off to headquarters . In a Capitol Hill serving kitchen he smoked the peace pipe with Sam Rayburn and bloodless National Chairman Paul Butler . The sacrifice was coolly arranged .
