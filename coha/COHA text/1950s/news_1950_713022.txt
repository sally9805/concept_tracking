txt In politics , consistency seldom is prized as a virtue . But it would seem logical that those who have pointed with disapproval since the war at what monopoly has led to in Britain should be logically the first to clamor against the basing-point bill , rather than to support it . The stock reaction of almost any American businessman or industrialist to present-day Britain is that we see in Britain the leading example of what happens when competi lion is allowed to lapse . The line of reasoning  --  you - undoubtedly have heard it many times  --  is that the British long ago abandoned competition in the interest of rigged markets . The result was first . private monopoly , and now public monopoly . The moral , if the story has a moral , is that every businessman and industrialist in the ' United States should make himself a crusader for compeition. and for the laws which keep competition as alive as it still is in America . Of those laws , the antitrust acts are the backbone . In the familiar story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the blessing which has kept us from going the way of Britain . A A A BUt when the votes came on the new basing-point bill ( S. 10018 ) . the line-up did not show those who praise free enterprise before breakfast against it and the supposedly pro-control New Dealers for it . On the contrary . the New Dealing Democrats were against the bill ; while the men usually considered conservative formed a coalition in its favor . This does n't make sense from any point of view . The bill would legalize certain forms of price fixing within an industry . Price fixing within an industry tends to stifle competition . Stifling of competition tends to encourage monopoly . In this case , defenders of the bill contend that adequate safeguards against dangerous monopoly are written into the bill . Nevertheless , the bill represents a legaliza tion of price-fixing practicE which have been illegal sinc 1948 and which now are favored by big and established interests and opposed by smal ' and young interests . A man who really believes in state control of industry would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase bigness because it is the general historic rule that the more the concentration of industry the greater the pressures for government to control and ultimately to seize . A A A Just as logically , a man who believes in keeping business in private hands would vote for measures to curb bigness , because the curbing of bigness avoids the arguments for state controls . Instead of such a logical line-up of votes on the basing-point bill . we had just the reverse . Conservatives favored the measure . thus presumably paving the way ultimately for the controllers . On the other hand , the New Dealers votedagainst it , thus presumably trying to stave off the day when bigness in industry would make a case for more government controls . All of this would become totally incomprehensive to our " man from Mars " if you were to bring into the picture the memory of what President Roosevelt did to our antitrust laws when he set up the NRA at the beginning of his first administration . You remember the " blue eagle , " do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permit " voluntary " price fixing within trades and industries . Mr. Roosevelt 's NRA came very close to wrecking our antitrust laws . It was a heyday for bigness . It was also a black day for free competition . The basing-point bill , if signed by Mr. Truman , will benefit big business against smaller competition . The amount of benefit is controversial , but there will be some benefit . Perhaps it is best that bigness be given the advantage . That is a big question and one for ? each individual to decide for himself . But we should not fool ourselves into thinking that we are moving toward more free competition if this bill becomes law . We , in fact , would be moving away from free competition . And the absurd and baffling thing about it is that self-styled conservatives and free enterprisers voted for it while the New Dealers voted against it . Plainly , our thinking about economic matters is getting confused .                   @ @
