Over the entire scene hovered the breath of the silent desert , the hush of ages . Then a voice spoke . <P> " For God 's sakes , Betsy , stop wiggling , " said the voice . " Hold on a minute while I take another light reading . . . Now , smile . " <P> Click . <P> " Fine . Now just one more , and this time smile as if you mean it . " <P> Before the natural wonders of the world and facing its innumerable small mysteries , before Niagara Falls , Mount Rushmore and the Eiffel Tower , in Siamese temples , French cathedrals and New England general stores , at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and at the top of the Empire State Building , the U.S. amateur photographer pursues his hobby . His camera 's combined clicks ( he is taking nearly 2 billion pictures this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined light from his flashbulbs ( he is using 500 million ) would make a major planet pale .

Americans are wrapped in photographs ; in newspapers , magazines , movies , billboards , the camera shows them the microbe as big as a face , a face as big as a city block , an entire city as plainly as their own street , their own street as fresh and exciting as a foreign shore .
