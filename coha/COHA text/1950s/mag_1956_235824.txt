The 1,600 hourly rated employees of the Cleveland Pneumatic Tool Co. , makers of aircraft shock absorbers , walked out on strike last week and threw a picket line around the company . It was like any other strike , with one important difference . The strikers were , in effect , striking against themselves ; they own 49% of the company . In 1953 the hourly workers , office help and executives authorized their pension trusts to buy Pneumatic Tool for $11,803,000 . The stock was divided between the two trusts , with 49% going to the workers , the remaining 51% going to the 150 executives ( from foremen to president ) . <P> The first year the 49-percenters received $2,000,000 as their share of the profits . But they also had complaints : the profits were paid out not as cash dividends but into the complicated trust fund ; they had no representation on the board ; management bought competing companies and shifted work to them " without consulting us stockholders . " As owners , the hourly employees stoutly insisted : " Management has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force " ; as workers they belonged to an independent plant union . <P> The dividing point came when the 49-percenters asked , as employees , for a 28an-hour wage hike , later dropped to 17 ; management came up to ii&lt;f , and there both sides deadlocked . The 49-percenters thereupon asked , as part owners , for an investigation of executive salaries , were told it was none of their business . Said a striker bitterly : " We do n't own this place . All we got amounts to nothing more than death benefits and severance pay . "
