IN THE three short days of its sixty-first convention , the National Association of Manufacturers was exposed to the assorted heretical doctrines of God , the Irish poets and American youth , in that order . It is not so frivolous to say that the NAM , after those frightening visitations , owes its collective sanity to the lavishly padded interior of its meeting place , the Waldorf-Astoria , where nothing that happens seems to bear any relation to reality ; and the speakers drawn from its own membership , who managed in spite of the convention theme of " New Dimensions for America " to convey the warming impression that everything was still as it always was and ever shall be  --  except , of course , for the growing menace of labor and socialism ( and they , after all , are old and comfortable menaces to the NAM ) . The real menaces were the guest outsiders ( religious , poetic and young ) , for the logical conclusion of their combined messages could only be the dissolution of the NAM and a mass return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages came at the rate of one each day  --  each more surprising than the last . The first was from God , who is rather expected to throw a note of warning around at such occasions . It was delivered this time by The Very Reverend William A. Donaghy , S. J. , president of Holy Cross , who turned out to be an unusually articulate and menacing messenger of the Word . He took as his text the decline and fall of Rome , Carthage  --  and possibly New York . He quoted to the manufacturers from Polybius : The Romans do not trouble about the moral decline of the empire . All that they ask is that it should be prosperous and secure . " What contents us , " they say , " is that everyone should be able to increase his wealth so that he can afford a lavish expenditure and can keep the weak in subjection . " He recounted the tale of the tanktributor. corps soldiers in the African campaign of World War II who rumbled past the mute sign in the wasted desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America did not return to the ways of the Spirit there could some day be " a similar bleak deserted plain and a similar pathetic sign ? New York . " He called for a new dimension of Faith and a rejection of the purely materialistic way of life which put men in " a world bounded on the East and West by birth and death , on the North and South by Dun and Bradstreet . " Beatrice , Nebraska , this fall and got his mandate to speak in New York on " New Dimensions for America . " Introduced to the assembly as a Sunday School teacher as well as a successful manufacturer , Mr. Jones took the stand , unbuttoned and re-buttoned his blue double-breasted suitcoat and began with this thought that must have come to him at the time of agony in Beatrice : " I am told that Abraham Lincoln once gave a very simple analytical outlinethat could be applied to many situations . He asked these questions : 1 . Where are you ? 2 . In what direction are you going ? 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked himself the first question , and wrenched out this conclusion : " Well , at least we are not in the past . Whenever I am tempted to live in the past , I am reminded of a comment that was often made by W. B. Morton , the founder of the Store-Kraft Manufacturing Company : ' Things are n't what they used to be and never were . ' No , we are not living in the past . " THE New Dimensions for America were taking shape , and the NAM pressed on down the trackless red-carpeted frontiers of the Waldorf , rising Thursday morning to the Starlight Roof for a session of the wives sternly titled " Women Mean Business . " The Starlight Roof suggests the scene of a funeral that might have been staged by Jay Gatsby in his headier days . The ladies , heavily hatted and furred , moved in quietly to expose themselves to the promised enlightenment . They were told in the twanging tones of Walter G. Koch , president of the International Steel Company , that " Women Mean Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all stock , 65 per cent of all savings accounts and the deeds to 40 per cent of all homes in America ? In recognition of their great role in the economy , president Parker would speak to them on the subject " You and Your NAM " and pull no punches  --  it was time for women to share the responsibilities and Vnow the truth . He told them that the NAM " stands for freedom . " The ladies raised no argument to that , and seemed willing enough to accept Mr. Parker 's subsequent challenge that they learn about economics , politics and such matters , and keep right up there with the menfolk . As a first step in their education , a style show was presented with costumes " from many lands , " and a chatty commentary informed the girls as a model floated up the aisle in a German peasant costume that " Germany is a land of romantic scenery and wonderful castles  --  seemingly unchanged through the centuries . " So much for Germany . BUT THE hard facts of current problems were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Henry J. Taylor , radio commentator and prophet . Mr. Taylor rambled around the Suez question without much response and finally got down to Korea , which drew a good hand from the ladies in praise of General Douglas MacArthur . After a rather sketchy summary of the world 's pressure centers , Mr. Taylor prophesied that business , in general , whold be good next year . There would be " some uncertainties in certain industries , " he said ; but he felt that there was " no need to spell it out . " Thus armed , the ladies exited for lunch in the Grand Ballroom , evidently meaning business . THE program had said that Siobhan McKenna , then starring downtown in St. Joan , would be the " feature " of the luncheon entertainment . It did not say what she would do . And who among us , either the NAM folks or we few visitors of little faith , suspected that she would read to the National Association of Manufacturers from the poetry of James Stephens and William Butler Yeats ? With waiters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkened stage and the figure of Miss McKenna , straight and poised in a plain black suit , appeared before the manufacturers armed only with the volumes of Stephens and Yeats . The room gradually quieted and the audience sat 538 in respectful silence , applauding at appropriate intervals . It was , after all , being " entertained . " Miss McKenna pronounced to this concentration of country-club , Junior League , Chamber of Commerce leadership the words of James Stephens that " all that is lonely is beautiful " ; and out of Yeats , from The Ballad of Moll Magee , the notion that " God lights the stars , his candles , and looks upon the poor . " In the main section of the ballroom , the audience continued their mechanical cycle of silence and applause , but around the tables at the edges certain gentlemen began to show signs of restlessness . They were the older ones , who resembled Pravda-conceived cartoons of fat-cat capitalists , red-necked and recently heavy with poppy-seed rolls , no doubt wondering what the state of the world had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a citizen of Two Rivers , Michigan , asked a colleague from Marion , Indiana , " What 's this all about , anyway ? " The Hoosier gentleman evidently was n't up on his early Yeats , and suggested they " get outta here , " which they did . A man whose tag identified him as the president and treasurer of the Abrasive Machine Tools Corporation of East Providence , R. I. , wondered when the main speaker would come on . It was then that Miss McKenna was reading her final selection , which ended with the lines But I , being poor , have only my dreams ; I have spread my dreams under your feet ; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams . The lights went on , chairs shifted and the main speaker , Keith Funston , president of the New York Stock Exchange , was reminded of a story before plunging into his text ( " Needed : A Fair and Warmer Investment Climate " ) . It seems there were two fellows in some pretty hot spot , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me something tall , cool and loaded with gin , " and the second fellow said , " Careful what you say , you 're talking about my wife . " Yeats was gone ; the program was back down to business , But the sixty-first convention-4 the NAM was not yet free of the voices of heresy . On the third morning the student winners of the NAM 's annual scholarship awards were billed on a panel discussion with six industrialists to discuss " New Dimensions for America . " The official program reported that " These students were invited to attend all sessions of the three-day meeting so that they could observe at first hand industry 's thinking and philosophy . " The six industrialists were evidently unprepared for the possibility that the kids might not have dug the " thinking and philosophy " of the industry which they had just observed at first hand . After all , they were getting their scholarships , a trip to New York and a chance to talk to these prime movers of production . But the questioning had no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia Military Institute had some grave worries about the future of capitalism . " We know that another depression would ruin capitalism , " he said . " If we fall down like they did in the thirties , the plants 'll close up and we wo n't be able to open up again . NAM says it does n't like government centralization , but without government controls , what does NAM propose to do about the business cycle going another way ? If the government takes off controls , what does NAM propose to do in place of them ? " CADET Clarke was asured by one of the industrialists that the NAM " has more confidence in a free market than it has in the decisions of the bureaucrats " ; that it has " tremendous faith in the overall ability of the American consumer to spend his money . " One of the panelists , becoming aroused , asked Cadet Clarke if they did n't teach him over at that military academy how to get out there and fight for what he wanted , and not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , replied that at the military academy they taught him to obey his officers . The matter was dropped . It was then that Rosemary Lee The NATION ef , . Chathant ' College , PittsEntre , wished to put the question of federal . aid to education before the industrialists . She wished to quote from Peter Marshall that " Liberty is not the right to do what you please , but the opportunity to please do what is right . " " Would it , " she asked the panel , " be more democratic for a certain business to decide what is right  --  or for a whole government , representing all the people , to say if we need federal aid to education and ought to support it ? " Dr. Ralph Robey , economic adviser to the NAM , explained that he had no use for federal aid to education , that it would mean complete government control and that students ( " just like your ) would be told what to study and would have to do it , just as they did in Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed as Lloyd G. Becraft , a student at Montana State College . " I disagree with you , " he said . " I go to school at Montana State College and we get federal aid and our president says there are no strings attached and we do what we want , study what we want , think what we want . As for me , I 'd be in favor of accepting money from the Communist . party as long as there were no strings attached to it . " The audience was Wade* shifting , buzzing and laughing . The industrial panelists were beginning to raise their voices more than was necessary to be heard on the public address system . One blurted out that " Your parallel between taking money from the Communist party and the federal government is very apt . " THE interlocutor , sent for the occasion by NBC , looked for the next question . It came from Daniel S. Kemp of Reed College , Portland , Oregon . He wanted to know about the dangers of overproduction and its consequences to future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider these consequences now ? One of the industrialists answered him with the words of a popular song : Que sera , sera , the man said . Feeling perhaps that this was not enough , Cola G. Parker leaned to the microphone and explained to the lost young man from Oregon that the reason businesses failed , after all , was that they did n't do what the consumer wanted . Dr. Robey , getting more excited , moved to the fore and pounded out the philosophy of mass consumption . There was no need to worry about overproduction , he said , because of the wonderful phenomenon of con- itumpticit , whiCh resulted in this saving line of thought , as summed up in a little story : " Anything I have one of , I 'd like a second one of  --  at the right price  --  including my wife . " Thus introduced to the mystique of the American economy , the college students were told by the NBC man that the game was up , thanks for the questions . The audience was loudly astir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its national scholarships ? One NAM staffer who has been through several of these annual rites said they always had the student quiz , but the students had never been so " enthusiastic " before . There was the feeling that given another hour of questioning the industrialists would have had no choice but to ring down the curtain and revoke the scholarships . The world of the NAM conventions , usually bounded so safely ( to use the imagery of Father Donaghy ) on the East and West by Lexington and Park avenues , on the North and South by the laws of supply and demand , below by the Grand Ballroom and above by the Starlight Roof , had been badly violated . God and William Butler Yeats might be dismissed as " unrealistic . " But who could acsount for Lloyd G. Becraft , the boy from Bozeman , Montana ?
