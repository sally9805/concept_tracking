Within five years , rockets will be carrying mail and cargo across the Atlantic . Shortly thereafter , they will be carrying passengers . These predictions were made at last week 's Chicago meeting of the American Rocket Society by Harry F. Guggenheim , aircraft and rocket pioneer , and a director of the National Aeronautic Association . Guggenheim believes that rockets will cost less than jet airliners and will use less fuel because they will coast most of the way through the almost airless ionosphere . <P> For 40 years , said Guggenheim , he has been making aeronautical prophecies , and he has tended to err on the conservative side . In 1927 , for instance , he predicted ( with a good many escape clauses ) that " in this generation in which we are living " commercial aircraft would travel at 300 m.p.h . " At that time , " said Guggenheim , " I was branded a partisan and a visionary . "
