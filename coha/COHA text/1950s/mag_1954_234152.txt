The Immoralist ( adapted by Ruth &; Augustus Goetz from Andre Gide 's novel ) is perhaps the most outspoken treatment of homosexuality that Broadway has seen . Very likely it is also the most serious and dignified . Though treating nothing prissily with kid gloves , Playwrights Goetz treat everything clinically with rubber ones . Unlike Gide 's spiritually autobiographical novel , the play is less the study of a man than the story of a marriage . <P> As Michel , a young French archeologist , is about to leave for North Africa , a young girl with whom he has grown up confesses her love . Fond of her and desperately hoping , he marries Marcelline ; but North Africa , where homosexuality is rife , quickly complicates rather than resolves their problem . Michel succumbs , while the anguished , wholly disillusioned and half-deserted Marcelline takes to drink . Finding she is pregnant , she leaves Michel and goes back to France . He follows her there , and partly because of their coming child , partly because they are both so lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw of a " middle way . " <P> The Immoralist is an impressively honest study , at once understanding and detached . It chronicles the numbed suffering of a life-defrauded woman ; the guilty sinning of a basically moral man . But both the negatively rather than affirmatively tragic nature of the tale and the forthright yet emotionless nature of the telling are somewhat at odds with the genius of the theater . There is a little the air of a case history , yet without quite enough documentation , let alone drama . The play is accurate and revealing , but only in the way a blueprint is . Gide 's novel , though not very creative , is much less explicit and more complex ; in the play every character-corrupt Biskran houseboy , self-accepting homosexual shepherd-articulates a philosophy , is " placed " in the moral landscape . Everything is formulated rather than expressed . <P> The play remains , however , an effective formulation .

S. <P> Eliot ) finds the author of The Cocktail Party once again using the drawing room as a vestibule to the secret places of the heart . It shows him once again convinced , as a basis for seriousness , of the importance of being frivolous . It proves him once again-in his ability to make people speculate , argue , disagree-a master showman . But it is not , in the end , a successful play .
