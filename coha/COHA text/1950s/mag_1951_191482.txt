Since last May when the Democrats ( led by Cell Bayar ) upset the old Republican People 's Party ( TIME , May 22 ) , strange things have happened to the Turks . This week U.S. Air Secretary Thomas K. Finletter and aides dropped in for a quick look . He would find a country of energy and action , of democratic ferment and confusion . <P> Peasants , who never before dreamed of going over the head of the village headman , now stomp into governors ' offices with complaints , happily buttonhole parliamentary deputies on the street . <P> Ankara has become a spectacular mudslinger 's paradise . Competing in strong invective , Democrats charge Republicans were corrupt , and Republicans torment Democrats for unfulfilled election promises . The partisan press , now free as the wind off the Taurus mountains , got so abusive toward ex-President Ismet Inn that he refused to go to a diplomatic party given by President Bayar last month . <P> Last week a heckler made trouble for Prime Minister Adnan Menderes , who was addressing a Democratic Party congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being hustled to the nearest jail ( as he would have been a year ago ) , he was set free to go about his dissenting . <P> New Freedom . The Turks are enjoying every minute of the new freedom . The government is riding a wave of popularity . <P> The popularity of the young ( five years old ) Democratic Party is all the more impressive because it succeeded the party founded by the late great Kemal Atatrk and Atatrk is still the beloved hero of all the Turks . Yet the Democrats are undoing some excesses of Atatrk 's nationalist , Westernizing revolution . The new government , for instance , recognized the deep wellspring of Mohammedan faith among the people , and has encouraged religious teachings in schools . Atatrk 's old party goes along with the Moslem revival in Turkish life . Indeed , its dynamic young secretary general , Kasim Glek , declares that his party wants bipartisan participation not only in foreign affairs , but in religion as well . <P> The new government plugs for turning state-owned factories over to private industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to power , there was so little industry , so little private capital to foster it , that state business was a necessity . The Democrats hope that under present conditions the scope of private enterprise in Turkey can be enlarged . <P> New Wealth . Turkey 's economy is advancing , albeit slowly . The lira stood at 4.5 to the dollar ( free market ) a year ago , is now 3.5 . Foreign capital , long almost pathologically feared , is now free to enter . A new hydroelectric plant , which will increase electrical power by 50% , has been started with ECAid.
