Top Banana ( words &; music by Johnny Mercer ; book by Hy Kraft ; produced by Paula Stone &; Mike Sloane ) is the most enjoyable show , considering how many things are wrong with it , that Broadway has seen in years . Few recent musicals have been so generally fast on their feet ; fewer still have been so truly funny . And none has been more of a one-man show . <P> The man is engaging , bespectacled Phil ( High Button Shoes ) Silvers , who works like a truck horse at the speed of a race horse and with the timing of a steeplechaser . As TV 's headlining , scene-hogging , credit-grabbing Jerry Biffle , the sort of megalomaniac who would throw himself in the path of a car if the headlights seemed bright enough , he bears a distinct but not very damaging resemblance to Milton Berle . <P> Actually , the funniest things in Top Banana come , not out of Berle , but out of burleycue . The show polishes up one old burlesque routine after another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballet . It also has bits of sheer nonsense , such as three men getting into a hilarious Laocon-group tangle . As satire , Top Banana may not be very incisive , but as high jinks it is delightfully insane . <P> Fortunately , Top Banana does not depend on the usual musicomedy assets . Its music is discreetly commonplace ; its love story classically dull . And no doubt , limelight-hogging Jerry Biffle saw to it that the sets , the costumes , the chorines should have no distracting charms . Top Banana is a musicomedy that owes its liveliness to TV , its laughs to burlesque , its success to indefatigable Phil Silvers.
