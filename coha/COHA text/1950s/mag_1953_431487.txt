The law was thoroughgoing ; it took pains proscribe not only the town 's name , Georgetown , but also the very names of its streets . And the streets had interesting names ?

The River of Swans below us is better known by a later name : Potomac. * Indiamen Anchored in Rock Creek Our vantage point was a remote spot on the far edge of town . A short distance away sheep grazed , and an old vineyard was still cultivated . The pastoral touch seemed a bit unreal to me , for by taxi the White House was less than 10 minutes away .

For part of the way my homeward path led along the Georgetown-Bladensburg road , an important link in north-south communications during the Revolution and through the early years of the Republic . I strayed once to window-shop at Stombock 's saddlery . Gen. George S. Patton , Jr. , stopped here just before departing for the north African invasion . He strode in to pick up the belt and holsters he had ordered for his pearl-handled pistols .

The houses seemed to doze in the soft weather that day , and my gait slowed before I reached my corner bookstore to stop for a book ? and find coffee waiting , too . This corner of 28th and 0 Streets holds a fond place in Georgetown lore . It 's Miz Hullybus 's Corner , although she has n't been there for a long time .

When the limits of the District of Columbia were traced in 1791 , Georgetown found itself within them as part of Maryland 's contribution toward the area , " not exceeding ten miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . This chance circumstance , however , has never kept the town from priding itself on its separate identity . At first no one could challenge that identity . Founded in 1751 , Georgetown was already a mature community by the new Republic 's standards . It had a thriving trade , gay social life , and developing culture . Only paper plans existed for rearing a Nation 's Capital on the wild , tangled , and swamplands to the east and south . A scattering of structures and brick kilns broke this uninviting expanse in the spring of 1800 , when the entire National Government began arriving from the temporary capital at Philadelphia . Counting the President , cabinet members , officials , and clerks , the total of Federal employees was fewer than 150 . Georgetown , with a population of 3,000 , was not impressed . Lawmakers ' activities found scant space in its gazettes . Shipping news was more important . In time ? and it took almost a century ? the Federal City engulfed Georgetown , and the 53d Congress finally voted it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . kept on being Georgetown . This perseverance had its eventual reward . Three years ago Congress decided the legally nonexistent community had been surviving all along . A new law was approved . September 22 , 1950 , which defined its boundaries and set up precautions to preserve its character as a place of historic interest , though keeping it legally still part of the District of Columbia . " Old Georgetown , " as the law chose to call it , received the news with calm satisfaction . Where Tranquillity Waits Among the first evidences of community gratification was restoration of old street names . For the benefit of non-residents , our lampposts continue to display the designations imposed half a century ago when Congress directed the change of " nomenclature of the streets and avenues of Georgetown to conform to those of Washington .

The nearest boundary line is rarely more than half a dozen blocks away , for our town a small place . Its area covers little more than one square mile ; its people number about 15,000 . To come from " the city " to tranquil Georgetown is like being transported to a tight little village , remote and pleasant . There is a serenity about its narrow colonial streets with their uneven sidewalks of red brick . In summer arching trees turn many streets into tunnels of green . Old-fashioned coach lamps beside inviting doorways with polished knockers suggest a waiting welcome . Ivied walls , traceries of wrought iron , and historic houses small and great add to the illusion of timelessness .

The 1950 law was designed specifically to safeguard the architectural tradition that distinguished the town of yore . Exterior renovations or new construction now must be approved by the national Commission of Fine Arts . Owners of shops remodeled since the law 's enactment say their experience is that compliance with the " old-look " regulations brings better business . However , the two main business streets , M and Wisconsin Avenue , still have a way to go to catch up with residential areas in restoration work . More Than a Good Neighbor My wife and I bought our little home on 28th Street ( originally Montgomery ) not many years ago . We were veterans of Washington apartment-dwelling and had experimented with houses in the suburbs . Our first reaction to Georgetown was what a neighborly place we had discovered . We still feel that way . The neighborliness goes beyond exchanging recipes over back-yard fences , shopping for someone else , or a spur-of-the-moment thought to take flowers to the lady across the street .

Strangers find themselves speaking to strangers , often at length . The day war came Revived , Old Street Names Proclaim Georgetown 's Identity Abolished by law in 1895 , the town saw its charming but confusing street markers replaced by humdrum but informative letters and numbers . Today many lampposts use both systems . East Lane once lay on the outskirts .

One of the happiest men I have ever met was the padre of a small Georgetown parish whose salary was $150 a year ! When I heard this , I was incredulous . " Oh , I do n't need much , " he explained . " I have the rectory to live in . I do n't require much food , and those bills come out of the church fund . Some of the women come in to cook and clean the house . My clothes seem to last ; a new suit or pair of shoes every year or two are about the only major things . " He smiled in his unworldly way .

" Maryland Saw Possibilities Rock of Dunbarton , Rock Creek Plantation , Knave 's Disappointment , Beall 's Levels , Frogland , Discovery , Pretty Prospect , Conjurer 's Disappointment , Resurvey on Salop ? such were the names of holdings which , in whole or part , went to make up Georgetown . The site , with its rampart of heights , attracted the attention of a courageous Scot , Col. Ninian Beall ( pronounced " Bell " ) . He had commanded Maryland 's forces so ably against attacks by Indians that in 1703 the Province rewarded him with a patent of 795 acres on Rock Creek . This he called Rock of Dunbarton ( later spelled Dumbarton ) , perhaps for the great rock above the Clyde in his native land . Three decades later one George Gordon acquired some 100 acres adjoining Beall 's . Other settlers came , most of them Scots , with a few Irish and Germans .

The 60 acres were bought , at 50 shillings each , from George Gordon and a most reluctant George Beall , the colonel 's heir , who fought to the bitter end . Rapid expansion added almost 82 acres to the town before Washington became President . The port boomed because it tapped a rich agricultural area . Tobacco for export was almost gold ; a single hogshead ( 1,000 pounds ) brought " enough to purchase all the luxuries a family needed in the course of a year , " a historian of the era reports . Sister colonies and other parts of the world looked on Georgetown as their flour bin . Lumber , fish , and other goods moved in brisk demand .

An entry , " One Trunk Hosiery , " reminds one that men wore knee breeches then . Anyone knowing the romance of its past will find today 's water front a disillusioning place . Much of it lies in shadow under an elevated motor freeway ( page 516 ) . On Sunday mornings with my dog I have done a bit of nostalgic prowling along the river looking for ghosts where bulging warehouses used to be . Sand , gravel , and cement companies occupy most of the shore . There are a few lumberyards , building-supply firms , and a dump for structural steel . A stubby engine shunts freight cars about .

Thus it is always reassuring to pass the offices of William King &; Son , purveyors of coal and firewood to the town for generations . A sign on the brick wall proclaims : " On This Corner Since 1835 . " Businesses less than 50 years old here are regarded more or less as newcomers . The era of full-rigged merchantmen and flourishing commerce may be gone , but Georgetown remains Washington 's port of entry , as it was from the start . Our Custom House still collects substantial revenue for the U. S. Treasury . Last year 's total was nearly two and three-quarter million dollars . Collection of duties began soon after the War for Independence . The present Custom  |p519  National Geographic Photographers Volk-mar Wentzel and Bates Littlehales A Slum Alley in 1950 , Pomander Walk Presents a Tidy Look Today Authorities condemned ten houses in this small court as unfit for habitation .

Missing : a City Hall I stopped at the Custom House one day to chat with an official . It was good to hear that silks and satins for milady are still prominent among imports as in early times . Almost anyone can direct a stranger to the Post Office on the first floor . Fewer are aware that customs is just upstairs . It takes a real old-timer to tell you the whereabouts of the missing City Hall . It , too , was in this building . The customs man recalled hearing about it . " When I came here as a young man , there was a battered metal sign drifting around . It read Office of the Mayor . ' You never knew where it would turn up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared . " The sign had survived a long time . The last mayor , councilmen , and magistrates moved out in 1871 , the year Congress integrated the town 's government with that of Washington . Georgetonians had reason to mourn their lost autonomy . Town ordinances over the years indicate that the officials were unusually practical and conscientious men . Indeed , the act founding the town provided that those failing to improve their property should lose it . Although legal penalties have lapsed , residents today comply with the law 's spirit , some with their own paintbrushes and ladders . Councilmen were stern with themselves , too . 520 The National Geo  |p520  Undue absence from a session or tardiness meant a fine for the offender . That law had teeth in it .

Celebrities from Washington to Spaatz Georgetown today is credited with having more listings in Who 's Who than any other place of comparable size . Illustrious ghosts might add that the town has been associating with famous names for generations and producing its own share of them . George Washington , a frequent guest , passed this way to his first inauguration. * Earlier , the town watched Braddock 's redcoats depart for disaster at Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War , then Lafayette leading troops through for the rendezvous with victory at Yorktown in 1781 . Union Tavern , on Bridge Street , long was a favorite with Government officials and celebrated visitors .

Sight-seers should have no trouble locating the northeast corner of Bridge and Washington ( M and 30th ) Streets , where the inn stood until 1935 .

Many factors contributed to the decline , but the full impact was not felt until late in the last century . A fall in the area 's water table and the silting up of the Potomac , due in part to bridge building for Washington , probably marked the beginning . As early as 1807 Georgetown reminded Congress of the gravity of the problem . Another memorial in 1836 complained that $180,000 of town funds had been spent between 1802 and 1830 for navigational improvements below the Capital and on the town harbor . Adequate aid did not materialize . Larger vessels sought other ports . Trade kept dropping off , however slowly .

Begun in 1828 to funnel more of the goods of a developing hinterland through Georgetown , it was not completed as far as Cumberland , Maryland , until 1850 . Floods , financial woes , and reorganizations harried its progress . Meanwhile the railroad had emerged as an increasingly ominous rival . This threat did not prevent the canal from enjoying its best years during the 1870 's and ' 80 's , although Georgetown 's stanch sympathy for the Confederate cause became a political liability after Appomattox , complicating the town 's fortunes . When the panic of 1873 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while the city of Washington was steadily growing . In the closing decades of the last century families of wealth and prominence from many parts of the Nation began moving to the Capital to take part in its political and social life . They built magnificent homes on L'Enfant 's once-empty avenues and entertained lavishly . Families drifted away from Georgetown for what were becoming more fashionable surroundings . " Georgetown ? Why nobody lives there ! " It came to that . The community deteriorated into a cheaprent neighborhood . Fine homes became second-class boardinghouses . Neglect and disrepair produced a dilapidated look . Property values hit bottom . For a mere $8 a month tenants had their choice of many snug brick houses of the Federal period , including the one now my own . Only a small Old Guard stubbornly held out , hoping against hope that Georgetown would have a rebirth . Americans Awake to a Heritage The Wilson administration brought Newton D.

" Instead the Bakers went to Georgetown ; the Secretary of War leased a fine old house at 3017 N Street ( page 544 ) . That may have n the town 's turning point . After World War I Americans began awakening to the graceful heritage of the country 's early architecture . Two influences helped to stir this interest ? the opening of the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Geographic St : . ? New York , and the work of John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , in restoring Williamsburg , Virginia. * Nations This was Georgetown 's moment .

Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the whole restoration movement is that it has been financed by private money , most of it on a family scale . No support came from large foundations , nor a cent in Government subsidy . Old Town Spirit Survives This may explain the resurgence of the old community spirit . The Georgetown Citizens Association and the Progressive Citizens Association led the fight to preserve the town 's character . When apartment builders threatened invasion during the revival 's early days , Georgetonians marshaled such a persuasive case that the District Zoning Commission fixed 40 feet as the maximum height for new structures in residential areas . Next they won their fight to have the town rezoned , so that commercial enterprises are now largely confined to Wisconsin Avenue and M Street , or the water-front district .

There are others only 9 , 10 , and 11 feet wide ( page 521 ) . Some are adorned with iron plaques which go back to the days of bucket brigades and amateur firefighters . These fire seals bear the emblems of the first local insurance firms . Volunteer fire companies controlled such underwriting ventures , and they did not forget the fact in answering alarms . If two houses in a neighborhood caught fire at the same time , the volunteers concentrated on the house bearing the insignia of their company . Any damage claims collected by their insured would affect the firemen 's pocketbooks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE : " Genesis of the Williamsburg Restoration , " by John D.

I think more effort is lavished on these gardens than on any other plots of soil in the world . It is estimated the town has 5,000 gardens , as against six swimming pools ( page 539 ) . Relatively few gardens are of the large , formal class , with expertly trimmed hedges and professionally tended plants . The others are zealous hobbies , and rewarding even when they do n't fulfill spring 's optimistic expectations .

" This policy has prevailed ever since . The college made its start with one small building , a few students , and a very limited library .

Here I found General Sherman 's shoulder straps , and paper money our town printed in its own name between 1800 and 1860 ? tobacco-coupon-sized notes worth from 12/ cents to a dollar . The name of William Gaston begins the lengthy list of those who have been students on the heights . Congressman and orator , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . North Carolina , his native State , made him its Chief Justice . " Maryland , My Maryland " came from the pen of another alumnus , James Ryder Randall . Joseph Clark , an early graduate , taught and encouraged Edgar Allan Poe , recognizing him as " a born poet . " Five relatives of George Washington attended the college . The sons of Presidents Van Buren , Tyler , and Johnson are on the rolls , and the adopted son of Jackson . An esteemed Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court , Edward Douglass White , is only one of the many sons of Georgetown who became distinguished public servants . Near the university campus is a celebrated institution , the Volta Bureau to promote the teaching of speech to the deaf . First of its kind in the world , the bureau was founded by Alexander Graham Bell , inventor of the telephone and second president of the National Geographic Society . In its Grecian-style building the bureau houses the world 's largest library on deafness . From it , for over 60 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . Along the lines of the bureau England modeled its National Institute for the Deaf and Japan revised its method of teaching the deaf . Last year the bureau 's small but dedicated staff answered thousands of letters from 37 foreign countries and the United States . It tells parents how to help their deaf babies talk and how to lead deaf sons and daughters from their silent world into the world of hearing people . A Romantic Story The Volta Bureau publishes a monthly review for teachers of speech and persons who are concerned with deafness . Sinclair Lewis was one of its early editors . Honorary President of the organization is Mrs. Calvin Coolidge , a teacher of the deaf before her marriage . Board members include Helen Keller , Mrs. Spencer Tracy , Supreme Court Justice Harold Burton , J. Edgar Hoover , and Dr. Gilbert Grosvenor . Behind the Volta Bureau is a romantic story . Alexander Graham Bell 's wife , deaf at the age of four years , had learned to speak and read lips with great facility as a child . This she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when no schools in the United States taught deaf children to speak . Inspired by his wife 's extraordinary achievement and realizing what her success meant to him , Bell determined that " no deaf child in America shall be allowed to grow up mute without earnest and persistent efforts having been made to teach him to speak and read lips . " Across the street from the bureau stands the former home of Alexander Melville Bell , father of the telephone 's inventor . Bell senior was himself the inventor of a system of visible speech which was an early aid in teaching the deaf to speak ( opposite ) . Telephone Aids the Deaf For 30 years Alexander Graham Bell maintained a laboratory in his father 's house , using the part which is now the garage . He called it the Volta Laboratory , for he financed it with France 's Volta Prize money which he won in 1880 for inventing the telephone . In this laboratory he and his associates perfected the graphophone . Few people are aware that the graphophone made the phonograph practicable by replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax records which could be used over and over again . Bell disposed of his patents and gladly used the money to endow the Volta Bureau . Another university neighbor is the Georgetown Visitation Convent , a girls ' boarding school , founded in 1799 . Three red brick buildings ? the academy , chapel , and monastery ? front on the street . The monastery windows are firmly shuttered from the inside . No curious passer-by may peer in . Those within have no desire to look out . They are cloistered nuns who teach in the academy . There is , of course . a street entrance for the 300 students , who are in high-school or junior-college courses . So well regarded is this convent , the first established in the infant United States for the higher education of Catholic girls , that there is always a waiting list . One man took no chances on his daughter 's admission . A few hours after her birth he wired , " Please enroll daughter for class of 1964 . " The movement to restore Georgetown was still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have blossomed into annual attractions . They are the garden and house tours , which each spring are a magnet for throngs of visitors . In 1928 an overburdened charity worker plainly needed a car . Public-spirited women decided to do something about it , and the  |p535  National Geographic Photographers R. Anthony Stewart and John E. Fletcher Alexander Melville Bell ( 1819-1905 ) : He Invented Visible Speech This distinguished Scot devised an alphabetlike system which used printed symbols to represent positions taken by the vocal organs in uttering vowels and consonants . His method was a boon to the deaf . Bell 's portrait hangs in the Volta Bureau , founded in 1887 by his son , Alexander Graham Bell , inventor of the telephone , who was determined that " no deaf child in America shall be allowed to grow up mute . " Dr. Bell conceived the Georgetown institution as a world clearinghouse for information that would help solve the problems of deafness . These visitors contrast a modern hearing aid with an old-fashioned trumpetlike device . idea of a garden pilgrimage was born . The car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , program advertising , and gifts , plus hard work and enthusiasm , finally gave them their monument . It was the Georgetown Neighborhood House , which opened in 1937 , seven years after a first humble beginning had been made . Here parents with jobs may leave nurseryage children . Hot lunch is served for those of school age , and they may return for a variety of after-school activities . Teen-agers and adults use the building evenings for recreation and club purposes . The house tour , started in 1927 , raises funds for the welfare work of St. John 's Episcopal Church . In the eyes of its present rector , the Reverend William M. Sharp , the opening of fine old mansions to the public is symbolic of a broader objective . " That goal is to open the door to better living for everyone of the community , regardless of race , color , or creed . " Democracy at Work I have heard it said that Georgetown is a good example of democracy at work . Wellto-do and poor families of different races and religions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual respect . One reason Georgetonians manage so well may be that a substantial number of them appear to take their churchgoing seriously . For a comparatively small community we have a large number of places of worship ? 22 Protestant and Catholic churches , a synagogue , and a " Temple of Islam " which serves a Negro Moslem sect . The Temple is half a block from my house . Women worshiping there give the street an  |p536  odd note of color as they pass on Sundays , clad in green , red , white , and lavender robes very much like Biblical dress . The Mount Zion Methodist Church , oldest Negro congregation in the District of Columbia , was founded in 1816 with 125 members . Before the Civil War its membership book frequently recorded opposite a name the single word " sold . " It meant the sale of a slave member . After the name of Edward Brown in 1834 appears : " sold ? poor fellow . " The More Things Change .. . One of Georgetown 's chief concerns in its early days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally mindful of the problem today . When the restoration began , it was accompanied by a crusade against trash , refuse , and unsanitary conditions . Street cleaners are held in proper regard here . I 've encountered them at work in the still sleeping streets as early as 6 in the morning . Each year they are guests of honor at a special garden party which includes speeches , lunch , and gratuities . One of the town 's leading women is hostess . Traffic also worried the first officials , apprehensive about the breakneck passage of stagecoaches or horsemen galloping through town . Since M Street is a busy channel for the Capital 's populous suburbs in Virginia , the traffic problem is still with us . In the past few years optimistic pleas have been made for holding motorists to the leisurely pace of bygone times , even if it meant stop signs at every intersection . As far as I can learn , such proposals are still tactfully pending . Some reminders of the past are convenient , even touching . Negro sawyers used to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths so a householder would have no trouble getting the right size to fit his fireplace . Sawyers are still part of the scene in late fall and winter . Most wood peddlers are motorized now , but from time to time I have seen some who rely on the old-style horse-drawn wagon . Like them , the itinerant fishman also believes old dobbin is here to stay awhile . On Christmas Eve , from colonial times until the Emancipation Proclamation , bands of slaves went through town singing carols in soft , rich voices . They were rewarded with sweetmeats and other gifts . Despite Georgetown 's stretch of lean years , Notice of change of address for your NATIONAL Gs the National Geographic Society by the first of the mo if you desire the address changed for your June numb not later than May 1 . Be sure to include your postal- graphic Magazine the custom survived . Negro children still go about the streets singing Christmas hymns and spirituals as only they can sing them . Georgetonians celebrated our town 's 200th anniversary in 1951 with understandable pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Georgetown " bill ( page 522 ) . A decorous observation it was , nothing to flaunt an older heritage and traditions before the much younger sections of the District of Columbia . The program provided for a parade , fancydress ball , dancing in the streets , concerts , and special church services . Its most imaginative feature was a revival of the fair authorized by the colonial act creating the town , said fair to be held spring and fall as " encouragement to back inhabitants , and others , to bring commodities there to sell and vend . " One pleasant evening after the bicentennial. my wife and I were sitting in the yard with the couple next door , a U. S. Navy commander and his wife , now lost to us by assignment in north Africa . We fell to talking about Georgetown . I recall observing how many towns there are in this country and the world which have kept one rendezvous with history and are content to bask in the reflection of that moment . Georgetown , it seems to me , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intends to continue . The Dumbarton Oaks meeting laying the groundwork for the United Nations might be cited as a recent indication of intent ( page 517 ) . The commander 's wife happened to be an Englishwoman , just about to become an American citizen . Perhaps her British background had something to do with the unexpected comment she offered . " Go It , Old Girl ! " " You know , " she said in the clipped manner that always delighted us , " I love it here . The town keeps reminding me more and more of the curtain lines in Laurence Housman 's Victoria Regina . The Queen describes how her jubilee procession neared Hyde Park Corner where suddenly a surge of men broke through the lines of police and troops . " They ran alongside her carriage , cheering and shouting : Go it , old girl ! You 've done it well ! Go it . ' " Somehow , you almost get to feel that way about Georgetown.
