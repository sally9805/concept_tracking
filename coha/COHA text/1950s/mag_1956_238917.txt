Early this month hundreds of clandestine pamphlets began circulating in Spain . Trumpeted one : " We demand the vital minimum salary of 75 pesetas a day and equal pay for women . We must protest the ridiculous wage increases that have been handed to us ... agitate for the minimum basic salary and a democratic Spain . " Some pamphlets urged workers to stage a demonstration in mid-April . Rebellious Madrid University students who had demonstrated against the government of Dictator Francisco Franco in February ( TIME , Feb. 20 ) planned new protests of their own , timed to break out just as Madrid played international host to a UNESCO meeting . <P> Last week , as the zero hour for the student demonstration approached , all Spain was alert , eyes expectantly concentrated on the big cities of Madrid and Barcelona . But it was in the Navarre mountain-encircled city of Pamplona ( pop . 73,000 ) , famed for its bullfight fiesta , that the trouble started . <P> Too Little Too Late . A wildcat strike of 6,000 transport , industrial and catering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said Civil Governor Carlos Arias : " Order will be re established in a firm and inflexible manner . " Though Arias threatened that workers would lose their social benefits , and called out the Guardia Civil , Pamplona 's workers paraded the city 's sunny streets in their best clothes . The strike fever spread to the Basque city of Bilbao ( scene of a 1953 stoppage of shipbuilders ) , Tolosa , San Sebastian and other northern towns . Thus far only workers in small dispersed industries were affected , but when metalworkers in Barcelona walked off their jobs , the government got tough . Army General Felipe Acedo , governor of Barcelona , promptly jailed strikers and closed the struck factories . <P> <P> The strikes were the direct result of Spain 's skyrocketing inflation , brought about to some extent by heavy U.S. spending in Spain , and in part , by the damage done to crops by this year 's severe spring freezes . Last July Spanish workers took their case to Dictator Franco himself , asked for a basic minimum wage of 75 pesetas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medievalist in economics as in politics : " Nothing can be gained if we artificially raise salaries . That rise would be followed by a corresponding rise in prices , and you would be much poorer than you are today . " Some 700 delegates ( representing an estimated 8,000,000 Spanish workers ) went back muttering to their sindicados . Last month , when Labor Minister Jose Antonio Giron announced a 20% hike in minimum basic salaries , this belated and inadequate increase was a chilling disillusionment to millions of workers . <P> Republicans Remember . Last week an estimated 50,000 workers were on strike in the north of Spain . Clandestine strike propaganda cited the profits made by Spanish enterprises and at least one illegal poster exhorted : " Spanish Republicans , do not forget this day ! " Thousands of additional guards were called out to reinforce the already formidable Franco police forces in northern Spain . In a country where strikes are forbidden , the absence of arbitration machinery makes it difficult for the dictatorship to settle the strikes in any way but to crush them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
