In Washington this week , just as a grand jury was about to consider the Government 's criminal case against five big oil companies* on cartel charges , the U.S. <P> suddenly changed its course . The Government , which planned to base its case on a 900-page report by the Federal Trade Commission ( TIME , Sept. 1 ) , had hoped to get a criminal indictment charging the companies with splitting most of the free world 's oil output between them , and fixing prices among themselves to eliminate competition . But this week the U.S. unexpectedly offered to drop the criminal charges , provided the companies would produce the voluminous records needed so that the Government could go ahead with a civil suit . <P> The decision to drop the criminal action was made by the National Security Council , top U.S. policymaking body , at the request of the State and Defense Departments . These top agencies reasoned that a criminal indictment against the companies would 1 ) discourage U.S. private investment abroad at precisely the time when it is needed the most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse to break its U.S. contracts at will . <P> The oil companies agreed with all that , but not with the idea of automatically subjecting themselves to a civil suit even though the Government indicated it was willing to settle a civil case by an out-of-court consent decree . Oil company law yers , after a stormy meeting with Attor ney General James McGranery , called the offer " outrageous blackmail " and said they would never accept such an " insulting " proposal . Meanwhile , the companies , except Gulf , were still awaiting trial of another suit charging them with over pricing oil sold to ECA . <P> <P> * Jersey Standard , Standard of California , Socony-Vacuum , Texas Co. , Gulf .
