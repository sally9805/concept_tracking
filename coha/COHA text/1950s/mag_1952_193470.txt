IN the mushroom-clouded dawn of the Atomic Age , dark as it was with fresh dangers for the human race , there shone a ray of brilliant promise ; the sudden abundance of radioactive elements gave medical researchers their most important new tools since the invention of the microscope . For five years now , physicians and biochemists have been learning to handle them . <P> How much progress have they made ? <P> The short answer is that they have wrought no miracles . Atomic medicine has cured no disease that can not be cured without it . But in five years there has been time to explore only a fraction of the new frontier-and meanwhile there have come discoveries in three directions that are worth cheering about : <P> TREATMENT : radioactive iodine , phosphorus and gold are effective in half a dozen diseases , though in no more . <P> DIAGNOSIS : radioisotopes of iodine , sodium and potassium have already proved helpful in appraising several disorders of body chemistry , e.g. , in cases of heart and kidney disease , to help establish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are helpful in locating brain tumors . <P> STUDY OF BODY FUNCTION : with " tracer " doses of dozens of radioactive elements , medical researchers are beginning to learn things they never knew before about how the body , sick . or well , performs some of its incredibly complex chemical processes . Biochemists will be busy for many years in this field . Eventually their knowledge should lead to better ways of treating a host of diseases , and probably to new ways of curing some . <P> Iodine Is Unique . So far , about the only evident cure that atomic medicine can claim is with radioactive iodine in severe cases of Graves 's disease ( overactivity of the thyroid gland ) . For these , it is as good as other drugs or surgery , and probably better . Until radioisotopes began to be made ( in cyclotrons ) in the ' 303 , doctors were able to use only " external radiation " -X rays from an assortment of machines-or the closely related gamma rays given off by radium as it decays to lead . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater concentration than any other part of the body by a factor of 100 or more t01 . So radioactive iodine ( known as iodine-131 from its atomic weight ) *was the answer to the radiologists ' dream : it supplied internal radiation in a highly selective way . As the iodine crowded into thethyroid of a victim of <P> Graves 's disease , its disintegrating atoms destroyed the-overactive tissue . <P> Nothing could have been neater-and nothing could have led to more disappointment . For , inevitably , researchers began to hunt for other elements which would localize equally well in a particular part of the body . They found none . <P> However , they found another valuable treatment use for radio-iodine . Cancer of the thyroid is not a common disease , and most cases do not yield to radio-iodine . <P> <P> But 15% to 20% of the time , the thyroid-cancer colonies which spread through the body behave like little thyroid glands and pick up radio-iodine . Such a case was that of Norman Bennett .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
