Miniaturization <P> It is by studying little things that we attain the great art of having as little misery and as much happiness as possible . <P> - Samuel Johnson-1763 <P> TODAY , nearly 200 years later , U.S. industry has coined a clumsy but descriptive 20th century word for Essayist Johnson 's 18th century goal : miniaturization . As never before , businessmen are " studying little things , " and through them , learning to accomplish more and more with ever-smaller , but enormously more efficient , machines . <P> Nowhere has the miniaturization trend brought greater rewards than in electronics . In place of old-style vacuum tubes , science has developed miniature tubes and tiny transistors no bigger than a shoelace tip to perform most of the same functions ( TIME , March 12 ) . The soldered-wire mazes of pre-war radio sets are giving way to electronic circuits printed on blotter-thin panels . Electric motors have shrunk to the size of a man 's thumb , delicate gyroscopes to the size of a bottle stopper . <P> - <P> Thus far , miniaturization 's greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without miniaturization , " says Rear Admiral Rawson Bennett , Chief of Naval Research , " much of the electronics equipment now in ships and planes and many of the Navy 's newest weapons would be impossible . " Miniaturized computers , radar sets , fire-control mechanisms and radios are the heart of every U.S. jet bomber and fighter . Today 's war planes are controlled by little black boxes so compact that to service a unit , Air Force mechanics simply remove the box , install a new one . <P> For its deadly Falcon air-to-air guided missile , Hughes Aircraft Co. has squeezed a guidance system equal to five TV sets into a space 6 in. by 10 in . World War II 's 200-lb. automatic pilot is obsolete ; a new model weighs only 75 Ibs. and performs six times as many functions . One item on the way : a small automatic pilot for helicopters , which are so difficult to fly that pilots sometimes pray for an extra hand . U.S. Time Corp. , which makes 400 , liny gyroscopes a month for guided missiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the bucking whirlybirds with a miniature autopilot . <P> In automation , says a Bell Telephone Laboratories executive , miniaturization makes possible the tiny servo-mechanisms , i.e. , electronic brains , which , built into machines , direct all their operations , automatically correct their errors . <P> <P> Scientists at Barnes Engineering Co. have developed an automated lathe that obediently turns out a variety of parts by following the coded instructions printed on a tape , which in turn direct a servomechanism system . Says International Business Machines ' Di rector of Applied Science Dr. Cuthbert C. Kurd : " If we do n't have min iaturization , we 'd soon have plants measuring ten miles by ten miles .
