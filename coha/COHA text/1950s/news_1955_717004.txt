txt A break came in the deadlocked cotton-rayon textile vraje negotiations today when five Fall River mills renewed their present contracts . Victor Canzano , cotton-rayon directbr of the Textile Workers Union , CIO , said this leaves only the Berkshire Hathaway , Inc. , mills in this area , holding out for the 10-cents-an-hour cut in fringe benefits asked by the employers . The union has demanded that the present contract with no cuts be renewed . The mills that capitulated did so just in time to avert a strike called for midnight tonight . They employ more than 3,500 workers and include the Sagamore Manufacturing Company . Howard Arthur Manufacturing Company , Foster Spinning Company , Bourne Mills , and Border City Manufacturing Company . Sonic Mill Yields All are members of the Fall River-New Bedford Textile Manufacturers Negotiating Group . Another firm , the Soule Mill of New Bedford , which is not a member of the group , also agreed today to renew its contract , Mr. Canzano said . The five Fall River mills apparently broke away from Berkshire Hathaway , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Canzano said he hoped this would start a movement that would avoid a strike . The Fall River-New Bedford group is considered the pattern-setter for wages in the cotton-rayon industry in New England . As a consequence , any break in the solid front of this group is considered significant . However , if other mills do not follow the Fall River example . some 26,000 workers may go on strike at midnight tonight . In Maine , some 6,000 workers of the Bates Manufacturing Company of Lewiston are also determined to strike at midnight against a similar pay cut . Maine 's Governor , Edmund S. Muskie , has called both sides together today in a final effort to stave off the strike . Mr. Canzano said earlier that 25 smaller mills employing about 18,000 workers have already renewed their contracts with no changes and no reservations for changes if the bigger mills set a different pattern . Bow to South ? Both sides in the dispute argue , with figures and emotions , to show that there is or is not a damaging wage differential between the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that is left in New England after 30 years of southward movement , and these are threatened as the southern skills improve . Employers say the issue is : " Shall the remaining New England mills be given the opportunity to continue making cloth , or shall they , ' as so many have been forced to do , give up and let southern mills make it all ? " Seabury Stanton , chairman of the board of the Berkshire Hathaway , Inc. , mills , said 39 mills have gone out of business , and with them 14,000 jobs since April , 1953 , under the present contract . He says there is a 23-cents-anhour wage differential . Mr. Canzano , on the other hand , said this is not the differential . He said a comparison of 16 fine fabric mills in the South and 16 in the North showed the southerners paying $1.31 an hours to the North 's $1.30 an hour . Fringe Benefits Mr. Stanton 's group says the difference is in the fringe benefits , where the mills are seeking the cuts . Fringes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Stanton holds . The mill 's request for a cut as broken down by the Northern Textile Association follows : 1 . Eliminate the 3-cents-anhour cost-of-living escalator clause . This would be the only amount that would come directly out of pay checks , it is said . The workers recently took an automatic cut of 1 cent an hour because of the clause . 2 . An over-all cut of 7 cents an hour in other fringes . This would affect some workers more than others . The cuts would include decreases in the amount of vacation pay , cut the six paid holidays to one , eliminate severance pay upon retirement , cut the third shift premium , and reduce health insurance benefits . Aid by Unionists Mr. Canzano pointed out that the $1.30-an-hour average is already well below the $1.67 for other industrial workers in New England . Since 85 per cent of the 300 , - 000 cotton and synthetic workers in the South are not in unions , the mills there can " just cut wages if we cut ours , and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even a short strike will work a hardship . Production for the fall markets should begin shortly . Any delay will lose precious orders .
