In his five years as president of the University of North Carolina , shy , hardworking Gordon Gray , 46 , won both the respect and the admiration of his three campuses . He carried on a $47 million building program , launched new four-year schools of medicine , dentistry and nursing , earnestly tried to make his university " the brain , the nerve center , the heart and the conscience and the will of the state . " But he was a man too much in demand : he was called so often to Wash ington-as special assistant to President Truman on foreign aid , director of the Psychological Strategy Board , chairman of the board that judged the Oppenheimer case , and now as Assistant Secretary of Defense-that for much of the time he was an absentee landlord . Too few of his colleagues got to know him well , and Gray himself realized the awkwardness of his position . Last week his trustees regretfully accepted his decision to leave for full-time duty with the Government .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
