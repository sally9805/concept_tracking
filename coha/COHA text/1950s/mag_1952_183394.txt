" Privileges are only a paltry make-believe , if not a fool 's paradise , " wrote Shri Hanwant Singh Bahadur , the titular Leader of Kings , King of Kings and Maharaja of Jodhpur . " Shorn of old feudal and autocratic character , a prince in free India should now rise to the level of Common Man . " <P> Last week , the burly young ( 28 ) Maharaja , known to his friends as " Funny Face , " was busy as a beaver rising to the level of common man in company with some 30 other bejeweled ex-potentates of India . All of them , stripped of princely power by their nation 's republican constitution , are running for office in India 's first general election , a month-long affair involving more than 176 million voters , 80% of whom are illiterate . <P> Sleight of Hand . The princes , sparked by Hanwant Singh , seemed determined to make the election not only history 's largest and longest , but its liveliest . Hanwant Singh , a polo player and amateur magician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London magicians asked him over to do some tricks for them , was proving himself a skilled political prestidigitator as well . Standing for both the national Parliament and the local Rajasthan state assembly , Hanwant Singh last week wrapped on his red-and-orange turban , sprayed himself generously with an oriental attar called Queen of the Night and flew his own Beechcraft to a rally of voters in a tiny village 70 miles south of Jodhpur City . <P> The happy electorate greeted him as the potentate he once was . As he mounted a waiting jeep , men rushed to touch his feet with their fingers . Housewives brought wheatcakes on silver plates to be blessed by him . <P> Women doused him with red mercuric oxide powder to insure his prosperity , priests recited verses from the Veda and an aged soldier seized a microphone to cry triumphantly : " His Highness is our father and mother . We must do what he orders and vote for him . " <P> The Cow Is Our Mother . Against such popular appeal , the snarling Communist and the colorless Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Maharaja had a few Tammany-style tricks up his sleeve as well . " In Bombay , " he told his audience , " Congress is permitting the erection of a factory where hundreds of cows will be killed ... to solve the food problem . The cow is like our mother . Perhaps Congress will next suggest that we should kill our mothers and eat them . " The voters howled in disgust at such a wicked thing , not knowing that there are in fact no such plans afoot . " The slavery of the British was a thousand times better than the Freedom of today , " the candidate went on . " I swear by the Goddess Chamunda that if elected I will continue to serve the people as my ancestors have done for seven hundred years . " <P> Such strenuous campaigning allows the Maharaja only four hours sleep a night , but enthusiasm and a daily dose of 15 Dexedrine tablets more than make up the loss as he travels from town to town past loudspeakers blaring , " Give your vote to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Joke . " The princes are sadly mistaken , " said India 's Congress Party Premier Nehru last week , " if they think that they can turn back the clock of progress . " Nevertheless , in Rajasthan the wise money was ten to one on the Maharaja to win .
