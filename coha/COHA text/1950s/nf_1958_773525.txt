" 19 Where a person 's history is known , his efforts at upward mobility are impeded by a sort of friction factor in terms of the conceptions of his initial status which are carried around in the attitudes of other members of the community . In other words , it appears that achieved status is more . characteristic of a secondary community , and ascribed status of a primary community . There are no really adequate data to indicate the permanence of ascribed status in American society . The available information , however , tends to support the points that : ( i ) most people do not move very far in the status hierarchy , and ( 2 ) vertical mobility is greater in distinctively urban occupations . Without revealing much of his procedure , McGuire tentatively concludes that about 25 per cent of each generation moves upward . ' ? North and Hatt state that , " Occupations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk of employees in any specific type of work are persons who are following in their father 's occupational footsteps . " They found the least mobility in the occupation of farming . Of the farmers in their study 84 per cent were sons of farmers and 73 per cent were grandsons of farmers.21 Using Edward 's sixfold classification of occupations ( professional ; proprietors , . // managers , and officials ; clerical ; skilled ; semi-skilled ; and unskilled ) , Davidson and Anderson report that : " From 6o to 73 per cent of the recorded regular occupations of sons fall upon or adjacent to the level of their fathers ' regular occupations . There is a significant difference between the amount of inheritance shown in the white collar ' groups ( professional , proprietors , and clerks ) and that of the manual-labor levels , the latter averaging 10 per cent more inheritance than the former . " 22 In the contemporary urban setting the individual , especially the young adult , may enter into a social situation relatively devoid of his history . That is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban ( secondary ) community tend to be segmental , of relatively brief duration , and hence with persons who are unacquainted with his origins and history . This means that in the city one is treated more as an individual and less as a member or representative of a family . " Except in the upper strata of society , where the status of one 's family of orientation is of primary concern in the problem of gaining acceptance , facts about one 's origins and initial status seem to be of the order of " incidental intelligence . " When a man applies for a job in the office of a large corporation , he may expect the personnel officer to be interested in his history and his family and to investigate his // references . It is characteristic of the city , however , that personnel information is routinely classified as confidential and is not known to one 's co-workers . In the urban middle and lower class more emphasis is placed upon such criteria as what one does , how one acts , what one knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation , income , mental acuity , social graces , etc. , as criteria for establishing one 's status denotes no overt or obvious functional relationship to one 's history or origins . A person does acquire overt characteristics of his ascribed status in the family setting , and he may reveal his origins through dress , speech , table manners , dietary preferences , etc . Other experiences , however , as in school or military service , may provide him with a new set of behavior patterns and thereby enable him to conceal in overt behavior the status inherited from his family . Because of the anonymity of the urban setting people seek to read each other 's overt behavior for clues as to status of origin . The emphasis upon the apparent attributes of the individual in the urban setting as contrasted with the emphasis upon his history in the primary setting provides some illumination concerning the urban emphasis on appearance . While some allowance must be made for urban-rural differences in per capita income , this fact in itself is inadequate to account for the differential expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income of $1500 urbanrural differences in expenditure for clothing are small . Above this figure there are important differences , in that the average for urban expenditures is greater than that for rural.24 One study of family expenditures in the period 1935 ? 36 showed that urban families in the $3000 ? $4000 level spent nearly twice as much per capita for clothing as did farm families at the same income level.2J " Where the individual // lives ? in a large city , a small city , a village , or on a farm ? has an effect on the amount spent for clothing ; the greater the urbanization , the greater the outlay . " 26 This general point of view seems to be expressed in the characteristically urban notion of " selling oneself . " By this is apparently meant that one of the techniques available for the achievement of upward mobility is that of creating the " best possible impression " upon those whom one meets . The impression created in " selling oneself " may or may not correspond to one 's capabilities or background , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear more " able , " more " successful , " of " higher class , " etc. , than one actually is . Because so many of a person 's contacts are of brief duration , it is assumed or hoped that strangers will accept him at a falsely high value and correspondingly grant him jobs , sales , promotions , and other favors . It seems clear that such an idea would be relatively meaningless in a society made up of persons one had known all his life . In Small Town Stuff Blumenthal reports , " One must be common ' in Mineville. " 27 Even in the urban middle class , however , one 's origins and history are not completely ignored . It is difficult to lose all the marks of one 's origins in terms of modes of speech , dress , etc . Moreover , racial , ethnic , and religious continuities are frequently ineradicable ? to some degree at least . Status in adulthood Where the society is of the open-class type , adulthood is the time of greatest opportunity to alter one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society creates opportunities for adults to acquire achieved statuses . The techniques available for such mobility depend upon the major activities in the society . Where there is considerable emphasis on military activities , as with the Comanche and Nazi Germany , warfare // is an obvious activity in which to achieve recognition , and . thereby higher status . The industrial-commercial emphasis in the United States has made business an important locus of opportunity for higher status . According to Allison Davis , we find , as we should expect , that status-conscious persons of middle class take their occupations particularly seriously , prepare for them in trade and professional schools and colleges , and evaluate jobs as good or bad in terms of the prospects which they hold for " promotion . " Since American society is conspicuously organized along industrial-commercial lines , it is realistic for an American to visualize his prospects for vertical mobility in occupational terms.28 Since occupation provides almost the only ladder for vertical mobility , the following remarks will apply directly only to those who are in the occupational system , i.e. , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than i out of every 3 women in the age range 2o64.2 ' The status of wife and children , who are economic dependents , is largely determined by the degree of vocational success , and hence by the upward , mobility , of the husband and father . We have already discussed status as it bears on children ; in the following sections we shall consider the status problems of wives and the aged . Some hold that the status-striving persons of the middle class are doomed to frustration because there are not enough statuses above every member of the class for each to be able to satisfy his desire for upward mobility . However , this seems an oversimplification of the situation . It appears that // many people of the middle class are quite disposed to accept as evidence of upward mobility one symbol : the opportunity to acquire more , and more expensive , goods . It is an economic commonplace that the general level of living has been rising in this country for better than a hundred years . By this we mean that more electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become available to a greater proportion of the people each year . Because of the general upward trend in the level of living , therefore , it follows that many can regard themselves as " arriving , " and the level of frustration should not be excessive if more and more people can continue to buy electric refrigerators , automobiles , homes , etc . Since in adulthood the opportunity arises for people to alter their statuses through the consequences of their activity in the occupational structure , it becomes apparent that for such persons the status-conferring function no longer resides in the institution of the family , but rather in the economic organization . It should not be concluded , however , that this observation is without implications for the family .. Typically , the status of the head of the family determines the status of the other members . Since his status is subject to continual modification by his performance in the occupational system , the status of all members of the family which he forms ( i.e. , the family of procreation , consisting of himself , wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have seen that for the child in the family of orientation status derives in large measure from the family ; but since the status of the family in turn derives from the performance of the head of the family in the occupational system , the ultimate source of even the child 's status comes from the economic organization . ' The fact that the status of wife and children depends upon the occupational performance of the father points up the paramount importance of his role in the family . In contrast with certain other family forms , this type of organization // places great emphasis upon the economic productivity of the father . His performance determines whether his dependents wear rags or sables , whether they fall or rise in the status hierarchy . This kind of family organization has implications for feelings of responsibility and anxiety on the part of the father , and for ambivalent feelings of resentment and of gratitude on the part of other family members . It is he who is vulnerable to censure when wife and children are unable to occupy the status to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such status in terms of expensive cars , clothes , entertainment , memberships , etc . We shall explore some of these implications in later chapters . Status of the wife 30 Popenoe has summarized a good deal of our discussion by noting that a man marries a wife but a woman marries a standard of living.31 This is , of course , the crux of the interest of single girls and of their parents in the " prospects " of their young men . While this situation seems generally to square with much of American experience , there is the question as to just how true it is , or , more precisely phrased , under what conditions it is true . In Western societies there are two conspicuous exceptions to the proposition that the status of the wife is determined by the status of the husband : the statuses of the Netherlands ' Queen Juliana and of Britain 's Princess Elizabeth determines the statuses of their husbands rather than vice versa . In American upper-class society a married woman does not entirely lose the ascribed status conferred upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known and remem- // bered . At this class level Miss Smith is remembered as being of the Smith family long after she becomes Mrs. Jones . An example from Oriental societies comes from the exceptional practice of matrilocal marriage , noted in Chapter 2 . More generally speaking , it appears that anything which obscures the woman 's premarital status facilitates her taking status from her husband . In American society two conditions which tend to produce this consequence are : ( I ) the practice of neo-local residence ( i.e. , the bride and groom set up a new residence apart from the home of either set of parents ) , and ( 2 ) living in the anonymity of the secondary community . Status of the aged In traditional Chinese society the aged men and women were persons of power and prestige . The status of the elderly in our society , however , is not usually one of glorificat ion . In view of the practice of retirement there is relatively little opportunity for an elderly person to improve his status by virtue of his own accomplishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " problems of the aged " are coming to the fore , no systematic study has been made of status at this level . Casual observation suggests , however , that the aged seek to retain their highest achieved status ? an effort which is complicated by the usual fact that income is considerably reduced in the period of retirement . The reduction in consuming power with its implication of reduction in status seems to be one of the major sources of anxiety among the aged . As we shall see in Chapter i 1 , however , the upper class again constitutes an exception . Here , where status is grounded in property rather than in occupation , and where there is a disposition to retain power until death , the aged have the opportunity to become patriarchs and matriarchs rather than " Burdens . " As we shall note in Chapters 7 and 8 , it is difficult to distinguish between a wish for a child 's success and a wish for // vicarious achievement through the accomplishments of the child . It is quite possible that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicarious achievement raises the possibility that the parents ' status may be improved through the achieved status of the adult offspring . To the writer 's knowledge no study has yet been made of the degree to which this has happened . Common observation suggests , however , that where the child has achieved a status considerably above that of the parents , a chasm is created between parents and child . While the child may provide the economic basis for the parents to live at the child 's higher level , both the overt and the covert manifestations of the parents ' own status have frequently been so deeply ingrained as to prevent their living comfortably at the new level . Summary Status , in a general sense , denotes a person 's position in some social structure in which he participates . Sociologists conceive of a person as having a plurality of statuses . " Family-oriented " statuses orient a person in his relations with other members of his family ; " society-oriented " statuses orient him with members of the society outside the family . " Ascribed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all societies the family confers statuses , including the status of legitimacy , upon its young . The family also contributes to the personality developed in the child , and this affects the social position achieved by him in the play group . Through exposing the child to a set of experiences both within and outside the home , the family creates a situation in which the child learns a set of behaviors appropriate to the socio-economic status of the family . The behaviors learned vary with the social class of the family of orientation . The degree to which one can achieve statuses varies from one society to another . In this country socio-economic status is perhaps the most conspicuous kind of achievable status . With certain exceptions , most particularly at the higher // socio-economic levels , the ultimate determinant of this kind of status in American society is the occupational system . The status-bearing link between the occupational structure and the family is the person or persons who are employed . Usually this is the father . With certain exceptions a woman loses many of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual for the father to confer statuses , including socio-economic , on the mother and the children . Thus the other members of the family are dependent upon the father for status as well as for maintenance . In their family of orientation the children receive not only the ascribed statuses , but also the numerous overt and covert marks of such statuses . When a child attains adulthood , he enters the occupational system , achieves a socio-economic status which probably is fairly close to that of his father , marries , starts his family , and renews the cycle . A daughter will generally marry a man whose socio-economic status corresponds at least roughly to her own.32 Deprived of occupation and faced with a reduction in income , the aged have difficulty in holding on to the symbols of the socio-economic status achieved during the productive years . Chapter 5 The Reproductive Function Reproduction and the family Unlike the economic and status-conferring functions previously considered , the reproductive function is unique to the family . While births do occur outside the family , the usual and approved ( i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . No known society , in other words , has institutionalized reproduction outside the family setting . This should not be construed to mean that all societies condemn premarital intercourse or conception . In some cultures it is conventional to defer the wedding until the bride-to-be has become pregnant . In order to confine the function of reproduction to the family , societies have developed various punishments for transgressions . As noted in Chapter 4 , Western societies have traditionally denied the right of inheritance to an illegitimate child , and the mother has been held up as an object of scorn . In general , the extreme deprivations consequent upon the status of bastardy have been mitigated throughout much of northern and western Europe and in the United States . Through the operation of confinement homes for unmarried mothers and the practice of placing the infant for immediate adoption , the punishment meted out to the mother has also been reduced . // The most conspicuous recent gesture in a Western country to lend approval to extramarital reproduction was the Nazi concept of the Kriegsvater . This meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier would be honored rather than stigmatized . Moreover , a memorandum discovered in the Reich Ministry of justice revealed that Hitler planned to increase the German population by a postwar program of free love and polygamy . ' In his satirical fantasy concerning the future of mankind , Aldous Huxley foresaw the day when children would be produced without any social father or mother , but would be incubated and hatched oviparously ( outside the mother 's body ) and reared communally according to their predetermined stations . ' These few exceptions ( real and imaginary ) to the contrary notwithstanding , however , it seems clear that the original proposition is generally true , i.e. , it is universally in the mores that the function of reproduction should be located in the family . One writer has neatly phrased the relation of the reproductive function to the family by asserting that the family consists of a woman with a child , and a than to look after her . Types of questions to be considered There are several questions which will direct our attention to an analytical consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reproduction carried on outside the family , or , to ask the question in normative terms , what is the relative incidence of illegitimacy ? ( 2 ) What is the relative incidence of the non-fulfillment of the reproductive function , or what is the proportion of childless marriages ? ( 3 ) How many children are there in those families which do have children , or what are the numbers of children in fertile marriage unions ? ( 4 ) How have these phenomena varied // through time , or what are the trends ? ( 5 ) What explanations can we offer for the trends ? Points of emphasis ( I ) We shall find that the birth rate and the number of children per family has been declining throughout our national history . ( 2 ) The rural regions have shown a consistently higher birth rate than the urban , and the lower socio-economic classes than the upper classes . The socioeconomic differential is not a simple one , however . ( 3 ) These trends should be interpreted in terms of a changing value system in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : illegitimacy In most countries it is very difficult to estimate the number of illegitimate births . The best data appear to be those of Sweden , where in 1937 about 1 child in 8 was illegitimate . ' For the same year it is estimated that in the United States I in every 25 live births was illegitimate . Estimates of illegitimacy in certain other European countries as of 1932 run from I in 50 live births in Bulgaria to I in 4 in Austria . In Latin America illegitimacy rates are reported as generally higher than in Europe . ' All of these data must be interpreted in the cultural context , however , as it is approved in some cultures to be married after the birth of the first child , while in others the custom of common law marriage may cause children to be reported as illegitimate . We may draw a distinction between legal illegitimacy and social illegitimacy . In Latin America , for example , there is a form of association known as " consensual union . " ' This form of association differs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former is not a legally recognized marriage . While children born of a consensual union carry no stigma and are therefore socially legitimate , they are legally illegitimate and account for the very high rates of illegitimacy reported in Latin American countries . Incidence of childlessness " Table 5 presents data on the proportion of childless married white women at two points in American history . The " cohort of 1865 ? 1870 " consists of women who were between 65 and 74 years of age inclusive in 1910 and had been mart ied at some time . They are spoken of as the " cohort of F1865 ? 187o " because it was during that period that this group of women passed their twenty-eighth birthdays ? the approximate average of the childbearing ages . Similarly , the " cohort 01 1920 " consists of women who were 45 ? 49 years of age in // 1940 and had been married . It will be seen that 15 per cent or approximately one seventh of the 1920 cohort was childless , that in the South the ratio was about 1 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 in 6 . When we consider the breakdown by type of area of residence , we encounter a pattern which is generally consistent for various types of fertility data : the rural farm area is the most prolific , the urban area is least prolific , and the rural nonfarm lies between the two . For the cohort of 1920 we note that 19 per cent of the urban women , 14 per cent of rural nonfarm , and 9 per cent of rural farm area were childless . Examining the interval of roughly a half century between the two cohorts , we note that the proportion of childlessness rose nearly loo per cent , from less than 1 in 12 in 1865 ? 187o to approximately 1 in 7 in 1920 . Data on more recent cohorts indicate that the trend toward childlessness has stabilized at about 15 per cent . " Number of children in families Table 6 shows that the modal ( or most frequently occurring ) number of children ever born to the cohort of 1920 was two . The modal number , moreover , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the four regions with the single exception of the rural farm area in the South , where the mode was three . The decline in fertility is again evident in that half a century earlier the modal number for the country as a whole was twice as great , or four , while in the South , if we disregard type of area of residence , the most frequently occurring number of children was eight . Taking another cut on the same issue , we may point out that nearly three quarters of the earlier cohort had more than two children , while less than half of the later cohort did ; nearly one // fifth of the earlier cohort had more than eight children , while less than one twenty-second of the later cohort had the same number . ' From a more recent set of data presented in Table 7 we see that the proportion of urban families with three or more children is 100 per cent ; of the rural nonfarm , 17.5 per cent ; and of the rural farm families , 22.7 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacement level is more than twice that of urban families . Trends in vital statistics The foregoing presentation has made us aware of the downward trend in fertility ( number of live births per woman ) , the upward trend in childlessness ( which may have leveled off ) , and the urban-rural differential in both . As we try to extend our historical view we rapidly encounter diffi- // culties , owing to the sparseness and fragmentary quality of the data . Because such a view is of value in enhancing our understanding of the modern family , however , let us see what can be gleaned from the longer view . The population of the world underwent a fourfold increase during the past three centuries . This was accomplished largely through a reduction in mortality rates . A very large proportion of this increase took place among EuroAmerican peoples . In the countries of western Europe and North America , however , the birth rates have fallen off so much in recent years that it is doubtful whether these countries will eventually be able to replace themselves . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates in our early history , the consensus of informed opinion is that the birth rates in the colonial and early national periods were remarkably high . According to Lotka , " Each fertile married woman in the Revolutionary period . . . bore on the average eight children ( the exact estimate for the year 1790 is 7.76 , with an inference that at an earlier date the // figure may have been even higher ) . " S The corresponding figure for native-white women in 1940 was 3.53.9 Calhoun cites considerable evidence of an impressionistic order to support the view that the populace of the colonial and early national periods was extraordinarily fertile . Concerning the colonial period he observes that families with ten children were common and those with twenty were not unusual . ' ? While Lotka did hold that the average number of children per fertile married woman in the colonial period might well have exceeded eight , it is doubtful that the number was higher than nine.1 ' It should be borne in mind , however , that the death rate at this period was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1789 the average new-born baby boy would live 34.5 years . ' By contrast , the figure in 1948 for males of all races was 64.7 years , and for white males , 65.5 years.13 Concerning mortality in the colonial period Calhoun remarks : " In the seventeenth century , in spite of early marriage and very high birth rate , increase was offset by frightful uortality of children ; so that the slaughter of womanhood iii incessant child-bearing was relatively vain . Significant is the inscription on a Plymouth grave-stone : Here lies with twenty small children . ' " 19 ' The very high birth rates of the colonial and early national periods were not to prove permanent . The earliest data on // trends in the birth rate in this country , going back to the early years of the nineteenth century , show a practically unbroken decline in the birth rate from that time to the years immediately preceding World War II . The Federal birth registration area was not organized until 1915 , but according to the number of children and women enumerated by the census @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large as in 1930 , and even as late as 188o women were twice as prolific as today 938 . Moreover , at no time in the past does the decline in fertility seem to have been as rapid as from 1925 ? 29 to 1930 ? 34 , when a drop of 16.8 per cent took place.l5 Class differentials in fertility Studies of differential fertility reveal variation in the fulfillment of the reproductive function . For our purposes the most illuminating of these studies are those pertaining to socio-economic , urban-rural , racial , and religious differences . The old adage that the rich get richer and the poor get children appears to be currently true , and has apparently been accurate over the period covered by adequate records in this country . In the early nineteenth century , before the diffusion of modern techniques of contraception , the birth rates in the lower economic classes were higher than those in the middle and upper classes.16 There are no nation-wide data on class membership , and therefore students in this area have relied on such indirect measures of class as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The general consensus of these studies has been to corroborate the negative correlation between socio-economic class and fertility ( i.e. , the higher the class , the lower the fertility ) .17 For // example , a set of data classifying urban wives by educational status shows the number of births per woo wives to be negatively correlated with the number of years of schooling . ( See Table 8 . ) When socio-economic status of native whites is stated either in terms of broad occupational group ( Table g ) or family income ( Table lo ) , however , the relationship between socio-economic level and fertility is still negative , but is no longer linear . In other words , the top occupational group and the top two income groups show higher fertility than the groups just below . A somewhat similar finding restilts from a study based upon census data in which the number of children under eighteen years was related to the amount of family income.18 This study concludes that : . . . the correlation of low income with large families per- sists only up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at the $2,500 to $3,000 income level 1940 data , families show some tendency to increase in size with increases in income , especially if this relatively good income is attained before 3o years of age . " 1 ' The Bureau of the Census provides supporting evidence for this point by reporting that there were more children per I000 employed men from 20 to 5 , ) in the professional and semi-professional occupations ( 520 ) than in the clerical ( 455 ) or service ( 393 ) occupations.LO A reversal of the usual negative trend has been revealed in Swedish data , which show a slight but positive correlation between birth rate and income.L1 A similar reversal has been reported in Chinese data.22 // Urban-rural differentials in fertility We shall now turn to a consideration of the urban-rural differential . For the country as a whole in 1940 , the net reproduction rate was o.96 . This means that under the fertility and mortality conditions then prevailing , and with allowance made for irregularities in the age and sex composition , the country would fall 4 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ) . The greatest contrast comes when we note that the net reproduction rates of urban , rural nonfarm , and rural farm areas were 0.74 , 1.14 , and 1.44 respectively.22 The urban areas were falling 26 per cent short of reproducing themselves , while the rural farm areas exceeded the replacement level by 44 per cent . Translating the net reproduction rates into family composition , we have seen that urban families exceed those of other areas in the proportion of those without children , and the rural farm areas exceed those of other areas in the proportion with three or more children . It appears , moreover , that the urban-rural differential is no recent phenomenon , but , on the contrary , has been evident as far back in our history as our records take us . We have already noted that the birth rate has been declining in the United States since 1790 , the year when our records begin . This decline has taken place both in the urban and in the rural areas . For example , if we take the East South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states as being typically urban , we find that the ratio of the " rural " to " urban " fertility remains nearly constant over the period 1800 ? 1940 : in 1800 the fertility of the rural states was 1.6 times that of the urban states ; in 1850 , it was 1.8 times greater ; in 1900 , 1.7 times greater ; and in 1940 , 1.5 times greater . Between 1800 and 1940 the fertility ratios in // the urban states , in the rural states , and in the country as a whole declined by about 70 per cent.24 Race and religion in differential fertility There are two other types of differential fertility that are commonly noted : those related to differences in race and in religious affiliation . The Negro constitutes the largest racial minority in the United States ( g.9 per cent in 1950 ) . Reliable data on Negro fertility are difficult to obtain for a variety of reasons . There has been a shift in the census classification from " Negro " to the larger " non-white " category ; until recently some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is high were not included in the registration area ; the amount of internal migration of Negroes is considerable ; and there is a greater under-registration of Negro births and deaths than of white.25 Bearing these inadequacies of the data in mind , we may venture the following remarks on differences and similarities in Negro-white fert i I ity . Whether measured by the crude birth rate , age-specific birth rates , or fertility ratio , Negro fertility is higher than white . In 1930 , for example , there were 358 children under 5 years of age per l000 Negro women , while the comparable fertility ratio among whites was 346.2 " In 1940 the ratios were 300 for Negroes and 278 for whites.27 The higher fer- . // tility of Negroes , moreover , has been reported for as recent a year as 1947.23 Higher Negro fertility , however , does not necessarily indicate that Negroes are increasing faster than the white population . Population size is determined by migration and mortality as well as by fertility . It appears that around 1980 whites had a higher rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) than the Negroes.2 ? Subsequently , however , the evidence suggests that the Negro rate of natural increase has surpassed that of whites . The trends in Negro and white mortality rates show how this may have happened . The Negro death rate continues to exceed that of whites , but in 1948 the difference between Negro and white life expectancies was only one half as great as it had been in the period Ig00-1802.30 From the data on Negro-white differences in vital trends we may draw one interesting , though tentative , conclusion : that Negro vital rates do not seem to differ greatly from those of whites when the two races live tender the same conditions . For both races the rural birth rates are higher than the urban , but a greater proportion of Negroes than of whites live in rural areas. i ' For both races the low-income families have the highest birth rates , but the proportion of low-income families is greater among Negroes than among whites . // Since Catholics constitute the largest non-Protestant group , and since they have an official policy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extant on religious differentials in fertility has been concerned with Catholicnon-Catholic , or Catholic-Protestant comparisons . Over the period 1919 ? 1933 Stouffer found that the Catholic fertility in Wisconsin was higher than that of non-Catholics , but that it was declining at a faster rate.32 A study of fertility in 1941 in Indianapolis showed that the Catholics had a higher fertility than the Protestants , but that in the mixed Protestant-Catholic marriages fertility was lower than in the Protestant group.33 ( See Table 11 . ) A public opinion poll conducted by Fortune magazine in 1936 revealed that a majority of the Catholic women studied reported that they favored giving information on birth control to married women , although they would deny it to unmarried women.34 A poll conducted by the Ladies ' Home Journal in 1938 provides additional information on the subject . 51 per cent of the Catholic women polled were " in favor of birth control , " as compared with 84 per cent of the Protestants . Both groups tressed the limitations of family income as the main reason for this attitude . There were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four children than any other number , but the average number desired was lightly higher in the Catholic group.3 ' Both this expression f attitude toward birth control and the decline in fertility eported by Stouffer suggest that vital trends among Cathtics are approaching that of the non-Catholic majority . It . I28 THE FAMILY AND ITS FUNCTIONS ulation which is rural , or , conversely , the negative correlation between fertility and the proportion urban . A changing reproductive pattern in a changing setting In attempting to interpret the radical decline in fertility , it is in order to examine the variation in the conditions of life over the past two or three centuries . Both in the New England towns of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and later on the frontier the conditions of life were such as to encourage early marriage and raising a family . In Puritan New England early marriages were regarded as " right " and " normal , " while bachelors were regarded with suspicion . Large numbers of women were wedded at sixteen , and if a girl remained at home until her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' The unmarried woman became a " stale maid " at twenty ; if she was married , she might well be a grandmother at twenty-seven.37 There were comparatively few unmarried people , and the lot of these was far from bright in the Puritan society . Bachelors were carefully watched and were not allowed to live alone . Each one was assigned to a family with whom he lived and who was responsible for his keeping proper hours.38 Unmarried women lived with relatives , assuming responsibility for household tasks , or perhaps they managed to achieve a bare living by keeping a dame 's school . Early marriage and the rearing of a large family constituted the usual pattern of the times . In the life of the pioneer , settling , building and protecting the home , and growing crops constituted a set of activities necessary for survival . The frontier had an abundance of land and a low density of population , and , accordingly , labor was scarce . From the discussion of the domestic division of labor in Chapter 3 , we can see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably more adequate life than was possible for a man alone . While life for the single man was difficult on the frontier , it was practically impossible for the single woman . Her alternative to matrimony was t hat of menial service in the household of a kinsman . Given these conditions of life , it is not difficult to understand why early marriages and numerous children were the order of the day , and why , as Calhoun points out , the family was " the one substantial social institution in a nation that had discarded hierarchical religion and that had reduced government to a minimum , while business corporations had not yet attained notable development . " " Commenting in 1776 on the relation between the conditions of life in the New World and the economic value of children , Adam Smith observed : Those who live to old age , it is said , frequently see there from fifty to a hundred , and sometimes many more descendants from their own body . Labor is there so well rewarded that a numerous family of children , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosperity to the parents . The labor of each child fore it can leave their house , is computed to be worth a honed pounds clear gain to them . A young widow with four or e young children , who , among the middling or inferior ranks people in Europe would have so little chance for a second husband , is there frequently counted as a sort of fortune . The hue of children is the greatest of all encouragement to marage . We can not , therefore , wonder that the people in North America should generally marry very young . Notwithstanding e great increase occasioned by such early marriages , there is a continual complaint of the scarcity of hands in North America.40 Our frontier crossed the continent and disappeared by the d of the last century . Behind the frontier developed tt led farm life , towns , and cities . With the advent of saniion and power machinery cities began to grow in number in size . The development of power equipment brought demand for labor to operate the machines . In Chapter 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization of the family . We noted that , as the economy became more complex and specialized , a progressively larger proportion of the population was engaged in production for the market rather than for their own consumption . The laboring unit became the individual worker rather than the family ; children became " mouths " rather than " hands . " As we also saw in Chapter 3 , the proportion of married women employed outside the home has increased greatly in recent years . This fact undoubtedly bears a close , albeit complex , relationship to the birth rate . The causal relationship is not simple . Having a child evidently reduces very greatly the probability that the mother will be in the labor force . At the same time , being in the labor force reduces the probability that a woman will bear a child within a given period of time . Having children involves an economic sacrifice to the parents in any case , but the sacrifice is doubly great when the wife must give up her job to become a mother . Furthermore , trends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jointly related to other factors . Gainful employment and family limitation may both be means of attaining the same objectives : a higher level of living or more independence and a broader sphere of interests for the wife . In many cases , also , women work in order to save money so that they can afford to have children . Therefore , no one can say exactly how much of the increase in employment of married women has been caused by the decline of the birth rate or how much of the decrease in fertility has been due to increased employment of potential mothers.41 However , the same writer goes on to say that " Increasing gainful employment of married women is not necessarily incompatible with a rising birth rate , as shown by our experience during the war when the number of wives in the labor force rose to an unprecedented figure while the birth rate shot upward . " 42 . // Irrespective of how ill-defined may be the nature of the relationship between paid employment and fertility , it is clear that married women in the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not in the labor force . In April 1949 it was estimated that the former had 206 children under 5 per moo women , while the latter had 676 , or more than three times as many.43 We have now noted the convergence of a number of factors related to a decline in the birth rate and size of family and an increase in the incidence of childlessness : the industrial revolution , urbanization , employment of women outside the home , etc . We have yet to show by more than circumstantial evidence that the decrease in fertility is in any way planned and controlled . The Indianapolis study previously cited furnishes some data on this point . One of the hypotheses of that study was : " The higher the socio-economic status , the higher the proportion of couples practicing contraception effectively , and the smaller the planned family . " 44 The first part of the hypothesis was confirmed ; the latter was not . In other words , at the higher status levels a greater proportion of effective planning of births was found . Within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive correlation beween fertility and socio-economic status.45 Significance of data on reproductive function From Table 5 ( p. 113 ) we saw that 1 out of every 7 married omen never bears a child . From Table 7 ( p. 116 ) we saw hat at any one moment the proportion is vastly greater ( 48.3 ? r cent in 1947 , or nearly 1 out of 2 ) . For these women and heir husbands , therefore , the family has no reproductive unction . These husbands and wives do not have the corn- // mon interest , activity , and responsibility which children represent.46 The decline in the average number of children per fertile married woman over the past century and a half from 7.8 to 3.5 , and in modal number over the past half century from 4 to 2 means that , numerically speaking , the magnitude of the common interest , activity , and responsibility has decreased . From these considerations we may infer that the reproductive bond between husband and wife , like the economic bond , has weakened appreciably . In this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we shall see in Chapters 6 , 8 , and 9 the reduction in the number of children seems to be correlated with an increased preoccupation with them and concern over their welfare . While the quantitative aspect of the problem is clear , therefore , the qualitative side must receive further consideration . As we take up the question of " Parenthood and Childlessness " in Chapter 7 , we shall analyze the problem of reproduction in social psychological terms and interpret the subjective factors that enter into differential fertility . In order to round out the present discussion , however , it is necessary to anticipate the subsequent analysis by briefly summarizing a few points . The presence of readily available contraceptive techniques makes parenthood to a considerable degree a voluntary matter . In modern American society there are numerous reasons both for having and for not having children . This congeries of pressures induces an ambivalent attitude toward parenthood . These reasons , however , operate differentially with respect to class level and character structure . It is our opinion that pressures on the middle class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause them to be most hesitant to reproduce . For reasons implied in Chapter 4 and discussed in Chapter 7 it is our judgment that the positive corre- // lation between status and fertility at the upper end of the status continuum is a real phenomenon with important social implications . In a broad sense Figure 2 ( p. 127 ) can be conceived as a sort of summary of what has been happening to the family . The declining curves may be thought of as a figurative representation of the course of the traditional functions of the rural family . The rising curve of urbanization may be regarded as portraying the development and diffusion of the new urban family , small in size and limited in function . Summary While reproduction takes place outside the family , it is institutionalized ( socially approved ) only within the family . In this , it differs from the economic and status functions . Reports on illegitimacy rates vary greatly ( I in 50 live births in Bulgaria , 1 in 4 in Austria ) . Frequently , however , the variation may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimacy . About 15 per cent of married women in America do not bear children . This is nearly double the proportion of a half century ago . The proportion of childless families in the urban North is over twice as great as on the farms of the South . Moreover , the average number of children has shrunk from nearly 8 in 1790 to about 3.5 in 1940 . Studies in differential fertility reveal that , in general , lower status people have more children than those of higher status ; rural have more than urban ; Negroes have more than whites ; and Catholics have more than Protestants . It appears , however , that there is a positive correlation between income and fertility in the highest income brackets . The rates for the rural , Negro , and Catholic groups have all been declining and may converge toward that of the urban , white , and Protestant population . In the seventeenth , eighteenth , and early nineteenth centuries the conditions of life encouraged early marriages and // large families . With the industrial revolution and the attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The availability of contraceptive techniques facilitated the planning of births , but the incidence of planning varies with socio-economic status . Quantitatively speaking , the significance of the reproductive function as a bond holding the family together has decreased . We shall consider its qualitative significance presently . Chapter 6 The Functions of Socialization and Security : The Over-all Trend Purpose of this chapter In the present chapter we shall consider two other functions of the family . ( i ) We shall attempt to distinguish three aspects of the function of socialization : the development of moral character , the acquisition of intellectual and motor skills , and the development of personality . Actually these three aspects of socialization represent differences in emphasis rather than easily distinguishable categories of a developmental process ; hence some overlap in their discussion is inevitable . Since the purpose of Part Three is to provide a social psychological analysis of the development of personality in the setting of the family , only enough of this argument ill be given in the present chapter to provide an adequate erspective . Accordingly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialization does not imply that t is is a trivial function of the modern American family . On It . contrary , it has assumed such great importance , relatively waking , that it will constitute the main theme of a major section of this book . ( 2 ) A similar point of view attends our treatment of the action of conferring security . We shall consider two kinds security , physical and psychic , the latter being subdivided 135 // into status and interpersonal . Each of these aspects has implications for the consideration of affection , recognition , and emotional security ? a set of topics which will receive more systematic attention in Parts Three and Four . In the present chapter we shall consider these functions in a conceptual scheme which makes them coordinate with the economic , status-conferring , and reproductive functions discussed in Chapters 3 to 5 . The reason for giving expanded treatment to socialization and security in Parts Three and Four is that they have become so much the core of modern American family life that we regard this distribution of emphasis an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present chapter we shall summarize the discussion of Part Two and endeavor to show the interrelationships and relative importance of the various functions as they are fulfilled in the modern American family . The nature of socialization All societies must have some technique for making participating adults out of the protoplasm that is the human infant . Along the route from infancy to adulthood the individual must learn how to live and work with others and to cooperate to the degree required by his society ; he must learn to accept the values of his culture and to react to a variety of situations in an acceptable and reasonably predictable fashion ; he must learn the skills necessary for his daily routines and for making a living . The development from an amoral , mind-less , skillless , and personality-less infant into a competent , participating adult is the process of being socialized . Those who assist the individual in undergoing this metamorphosis are fulfilling the function of socializing him . We may regard the process of socialization as having three objectives : the creating of an adult who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who manifests what his fellows in his social group regard as an acceptable personality . The problem of creating a moral adult out of an amoral infant is // roughly comparable to the task of " character development . " By way of distinction , the emphasis in the term morality is on t he matter of conformity with the values and mores of one 's culture , while in character development attention is also given " to volitional factors and to individual creativeness in the realm of goals to be achieved . . . " 1 Each culture contains expectations that , at all ages beyond infancy , the members of the society will exhibit a variety of skills , ranging from walking , and talking in the right language , to those which are involved in earning a living and making love . Finally , although the notion of personality development , as we conceive it , seems to have arisen quite recently , most societies do recognize appropriate and inappropriate modes of emotional response ; they appear to encourage the development of some , and to discourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis In all known societies the family is expected to assume conderable responsibility for the function of socialization. because of the helplessness and immobility of the infant the family always has responsibility for the earliest stages of this process . ( This topic will be developed in Chapter 8 . ) Since , however , it is not the practice in any known society for the dividual to remain isolated within the family until the age maturity , the process of socialization always goes on to me extent also outside the family . In contemporary America the child is socialized in a number of settings : the family , including father , mother , siblings , and other relatives ; schools of numerous varieties ; play groups ; " character building " and recreational agencies , e.g. , the church , Boy Scouts , Y.M.C.A. , playgrounds , etc. ; and is of mass communication , e.g. , radio , movies , television , etc . As we look back over American history , it appears that , . // except for the last , each of these types of agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban child . The church was an especially vigorous institution in Puritan New England , and schooling was available in the towns although boys were given preferential treatment in the amount and kind of schooling . The more isolated the residence of the family , however , the less available were these extra-familial agencies of socialization . We have seen that under conditions of isolation the family became the unit of economic organization and developed a virtually selfsufficient economy . The same conditions serve , of course , to make the family the sole means of carrying out such other , socially necessary , functions as socialization . In the present chapter we shall consider the degree to , and the conditions under which , the family shares with other institutions the responsibility for moralizing and educating the young . We shall also consider the extent to which extrafamilial agencies participate in the formation of personality . To do this , we shall have to discuss the socializing activities of other institutions . We shall see that under modern urban conditions there seems to be a trend in the function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but less demonstrable than that which we noted in the case of the economic function . In other words , when we use the early rural family as a standard of comparison for the contemporary urban family , it seems clear that the forrner carried much more nearly complete responsibility for socializing its young than does the latter . This generalization is most clearly evident in the skill-training aspect of socialization . With respect to character formation and personality development there arc counteracting influences , as we shall see , and consequently the situation is somewhat more complex . Education and personality development If given the widest possible denotation , the term education is synonymous with socialization . In history , however , THE FUNCTIONS OF SOCIALIZATION AND SECURITY 139+ and in much of contemporary practice the denotation of education is much more restricted . Notions as to what education is vary from time to time and from place to place . In terms of our three aspects of socialization , we in American society are most familiar with the idea that education is a process of instruction in mental skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-third Psalm from memory and to solve a quadratic equation . Closely related is a second conception , sometimes called " general education , " which involves acquainting oneself with the " essence " of one 's intellectual and moral cultural heritage . A third conception of education , also familar to us , is that of instruction in motor skills , such as learning to milk a cow and to drive a golf ball . A fourth conception of education involves the acquisition of " manners . " This combines the aspects of character and skills . A " well-mannered " person iii American society is expected to show such traits as politeness , deference , self-restraint , etc . He should also display a wide variety of skills , such as knowing how to use a knife and fork , how to be familiar with a variety of " cultural " subjects ( music , literature , sports , etc. ) , how to dress for various social occasions , whom to tip and how much . A fifth conception centers on the process of moralization . The form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception whereby an originally " depraved " child learned through inhibiting his sinful impulses to become a moral member of society Sixth and last is a conception more inclusive than ny of the others . Sometimes known as " progressive edu- // cation , " it involves the education of the " whole child . " By this is apparently meant education in all three aspects of socialization , although the three aspects are not equally emphasized . By contrast with the traditional approach , more explicit attention is given to personality development , less to character formation . Progressive education represents the application of the newer principles of personality development to the setting of the school . It includes mental skills , motor skills , and the development of socially approved attitudes and sentiments . With one important qualification it is a summation of the first five conceptions of education , plus a concern for personality development . The qualification is that it proceeds to stand the fifth conception ( moralization ) on its head . In other words , the theory of progressive education seems to proceed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than from the Puritan premise of the " depravity " of original nature . Preoccupation with personality development as a consciously conceived aspect of socialization appears to be a relatively recent phenomenon . It was given a great impetus by Freudian theory , which sensitized much of the reading public to distinguish between overt behavior and underlying motivation . In the absence of this sensitivity , overt conformity seems an adequate hallmark of acceptable character , and acceptable character may be thought of as the desired consequences of the fourth and fifth kinds of education : the demonstration of appropriate manners plus the inhibition of antisocial impulses . ' To the laity an awareness of the covert motivational aspects of personality has come through increasing familiarity with such terms as frustration , guilt , complex , etc . To those parents and teachers conversant with it , awareness of the general principles of Freudian theory has resulted in // a " new view " concerning procedures of child-rearing . ' The traditional view , which lacked this perspective , tended to emphasize moralization , or the negative side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conforming child ; its technique was that of " ordering and forbidding . " It was believed that the child would become a " moral " adult if his behavior conformed to a strictly conceived and enforced code . From the clinical studies in the psychoanalytic literature , however , the conclusion came to be drawn that sternness and repression on the part of parents , teachers , and other figures of authority , tended to produce guilt , anxiety , conflict , and neurotic symptoms in children . Among those parents and teachers who accept it , this belief has created the dilemma of how children can be brought to an acceptable level of selfrestraint without the baleful consequences of neurosis . In the " new view , " then , the objective of conformity has been subordinated to that of the development of a relatively conflict-free ( or " healthy " ) personality ; " understanding " the child has replaced " ordering and forbidding . " Within relatively recent times there have been indications of reaction against the " new view " in the direction of renewed emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objectives of conformity and spontaneity . Both the family and the school , as well as the so-called character-building agencies , have participated in the personality-development aspect of socialization under the traditional conception of character development . All of these to varying degrees , moreover , have begun to take account of the fewer perspective . We shall defer until Part Three a systematic : discussion of this process of personality development in the family . Under " The Whole Child ' and the School " // ( pp. 147 ? 52 ) in the present chapter we shall consider how it is worked out in the schools . The school Formal schooling becomes a functional necessity when the parent generation as a whole is unable to transmit the necessary skills to the following generation . Conditions are favorable for establishing a system of formal education : ( I ) when the sheer volume of culture to be transmitted becomes great ; ( 2 ) when there is enough surplus production to support the professional group of teachers ; ( 3 ) when the occupational organization is complex , containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupations are not hereditary . The early rural family , as we saw in Chapter 3 , contained little specialization except that associated with sex and age categories . The way of life demanded that each adult be master of a wide variety of skills ( hunting , fishing , clearing land , farming , etc. , for men ; milking , churning , spinning , weaving , cooking , etc. , for women ) . Since there was little interest in transmitting the heritage of Western culture and little surplus to support teachers , each adult was presumed to i have the background necessary to train children for the requirements of adult life . Puritan children generally learned to " read , write , and calculate , " and also acquired the skills of husbandry and housewifery . Not only was it expected that each family would provide these facets of education for their own children , but in addition , that they would provide them for any apprentices in their household . Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England for the period 1642 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , taking into consideration the great neglect in many parents and masters in training up their children in learning , and labor , and other imployments which may bee profitable to the common wealth , do hearupon order and decree , that iv every towne the chosen men appointed for managing the pruTHE // dencial affaires of the same shall hencefourth stand charged with the care of the redresse of this evill , so as they shalbee liable to bee punished or fined for the neglect thereof . . . and they shall have power to take accompt from time to time of their parents and masters , and of their children , concerning their calling and impliment of their children , especially of their ability to read and understand the principles of religion and the capital lawes of the country . ' The implication that not all families executed this obligation in any perfect fashion is supported by the provision that children might be removed from the home and put under more capable care if the parents neglected their duty to the point that children and servants became " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fines might be imposed upon the parents , and the children might be removed from the home . ' Formal schooling was provided for Puritan boys . Since woman was regarded as being distinctly inferior to man , there as little disposition to " squander " the resources of school or home on the education of girls . ' Calhoun notes the case // of one girl who took her seat daily on the schoolhouse steps in order to learn what she could from the lessons , ' a situation remarkedly parallel to that of the " untouchables " of India . In general , where school facilities were made available for the instruction of girls this was done so as not to interfere with the instruction of boys . Classes for girls might be held very early in the morning , late in the afternoon , or during vacation periods . Calhoun holds that the only significant tutelage of the Puritan girl lay in what she could learn from her mother . It has been estimated that over half of the propertied class of women in Massachusettes and Virginia during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where there are specialized trades there are limitations to the range of instruction which a father is competent to provide for his sons . On the other hand , if occupations are hereditary , as in the caste system of India or in the guild system of medieval Europe , vocational training can take place in the home or in the father 's shop . Where social mobility , both horizontal and vertical , are culturally approved , however , there arises a need for vocational instruction outside the home . In urban America this applied to sons but rarely to daughters . Accordingly , the practice of apprenticeship was invoked to enable boys to learn various trades . The work of women was much less differentiated than that of men . Therefore , the training which a mother could give her daughters was expected to prove adequate to later demands . // It was not unknown , however , for daughters as well as sons to be bound out.l " From these observations it seems quite evident that the degree to which and the areas where the family retains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , contingent , in part , upon the way in which the training in vocational skills has been administered . In general , as the practice of formal education grows , the function of the family shifts from that of providing education to one of providing the opportunity to be educated . For example , the practice of employing tutors in upper-class families of the Old South signified that the family had yielded to the tutors primary responsibility for the task of instructing the children in mental skills , manners , and " culture . " To the degree that the tutor , or private or public schoolmaster , took over educational responsibilities , the participation of the family became indirect , i.e. , through providing the economic basis in terms of instructors ' salaries . Another way in which the family participated was through providing the children with the necessary leisure to receive formal instruction . Shifts in educational emphasis The ethos of Puritan culture can be stated largely in terms of the dominance and pervasiveness of religious attitudes.11 The deity was of the Old Testament variety and demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To comply with the code called for a great exercise of self-restraint . To produce restrained and literate children was the purpose of socialization in the school . As we turn our attention southward , we may note that in the Middle Colonies parochial schools were prevalent.12 In the South many of the rich planters tried to establish their . class as a facsimile of the landed gentry of England . They employed tutors and governesses for the early training of their children and then sent their sons to be educated in English universities . In the post-Revolutionary period the economic base necessary for the foreign education of sons began to dwindle because of soil exhaustion and the repeated division of estates . Hence many of the sons who might otherwise have gone abroad for instruction were sent instead for a period of training in the counting houses of the major trading cities.13 Although in many places ( notably Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Delaware , and generally throughout the South ) , publicly supported schools were originally conceived as institutions of charity for the education of the children of paupers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the decades 1830-1860 . During this period the emphasis in education shifted from the content of theology and the method of memorization to one of general education and manual training , and a method of useful experiences and activities.14 Prior to this time the apprenticeship system had been the primary technique of vocational education . The concept of the purposes of education was changing along with content and method . By the end of World War I the emphasis in the concept of formal education had shifted markedly from that held by the Puritans . In 1918 , the United States Bureau of Education published a report en- // titled Cardinal Principles of Education . Ethical character , which was so prominent an objective in earlier education philosophy , was listed as the last of the seven objectives , while religious instruction was not even mentioned . The " whole child " and the school Under Francis Parker and John Dewey there began a rebellion against highly formalized educational practices . The adherence to the new concept of education became organized in the Progressive Education Association . The novel aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is the task of the school to educate the " whole child . " In line with this perspective the function of the school has been redefined to include the development of personality , integration of the child with the group , stimulating him to creativity or allowing him spontaneously to achieve an appreciable level of creativity . The conventional interest in the development of intellectual and motor skills is relatively de-emphasized and made coordinate with , if not subordinate to , the interest in personality development . It is reasoned that if a relatively conflictless personality is developed , the child will learn both skills and self-restraint more easily and efficiently . If the school is able to achieve the goals it defines for itself in terms of this concept of education , the implication is that the family is to become the caretaker of the child after school and during vacation periods . Looking at the general current literature on the care of the child , Green opines that it seems to be grounded in the assumption " that the parents have a combined culinary , nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The school program , moreover , takes up ! tore years and more days per year than heretofore . " It // frequently includes programs of activities to be undertaken " after hours " and during vacation periods . In addition to the general interest of contemporary educational theory in facilitating the individual 's social relationships , there has been a trend toward " educating for marriage and parenthood . " 17 Although this type of instruction , which frequently deals with sexual questions , is most commonly found at the college level , there has been considerable pressure to begin such instruction at the secondary and even the primary level . An interesting variation of this trend has been an occasional course designed to train the modern version of mother-substitute known as " baby-sitter . " 18 Other aspects of homemaking such as cooking and sewing have become integral parts of both high school and college curricula . For males , the counterpart of the home economics department is the school workshop where they learn the art of " fixing things , " and thus they are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Teachers who have the more traditional view of their function in terms of the transmission of skills and , to some degree at least , of character development , tend to view the success of their efforts in terms of grades competitively achieved and in terms of politeness , deference , and the other marks of manners . In the view of those who see " the whole child , " the traditional teacher tends to rate " the children in terms of their learning accomplishment , the problem of controlling their behavior in the group , their family background and status , or their personal appeal to the teacher . " Moreover , their records " really described the children less than they described the reaction of the persons making the entries . " 19 This conflict of attitudes within the ranks of the educators was dramatized some years ago by a study of teachers ' and mental hygienists ' conceptions of behavior problems among school children.20 The teachers tended to evaluate grades and conformity ( or skills and morality ) , while the mental hygienists rated conflict in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional rather than he progressive view of education . One of the concepts of contemporary psychology is that " problem children are the children of problem parents . " 21 ducators have not been reluctant to pursue the implications f this proposition by seeking to induce parents to participate n school programs . On occasion , moreover , the organismic oncept of education has been further extended to include // the modification of the attitudes and behavior of parents toward their children . At this juncture we see that the school has not only made a formal invasion of the area of personality formation as regards children , but is making gestures in the direction of socializing parents as well.22 It is consistent with the newer expanded view of education that schools should have developed a wide variety of services . Such ancillary activities , which are most unevenly distributed , include counseling , psychiatric , health , and job placement service . Some schools have established counseling services which employ trained persons 23 to handle the emotional as well as social and occupational problems of the student . Apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices , counselors identify those cases of serious maladjustment which are to be referred for more extensive therapy . Some school systems have their own psychological divisions , employing psychiatrists , social workers , and psychologists to take care of these referrals ; others utilize established clinics in the area . Visiting teachers are another aspect of this psychiatric service . It is their function to investigate the home situation and its relations to the maladjustment of the child in school . Although medical care remains largely the responsibility of the parents , schools do provide some health service . In a study covering eight states it was reported that 63 per cent of all counties had some kind of health program in the schools , and that the . // schools in these counties contained 81 per cent of the children from 5 to 14 years of age in those states . ' 4 The matter of finding a job after high school is facilitated in many schools by the establishment of placement bureaus , which thus provide the child with his initial contact to the occupational system . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with employers whom they may know . To provide a balanced picture , one must note that many schools do not operate on the basis of this broad concept of the educational process . No doubt the great majority of contemporary schools continue to operate along the more traditional line with , as the educators characteristically say , a view to teaching the subjects rather than the children . The purpose of this discussion of modern education has cell to show the wide range of activities and services which Ile schools ? or at least some of them ? afford . This concept f education is vastly broader than the basic skills of readng , writing , and calculating . A boy need no longer turn o his father to learn how to use a tennis racket , repair a bicycle , or make a pair of book-ends . No longer need girls ely on the age-old mother-to-daughter transmission of inforiation on how to cook , sew , raise children , or learn where babies come from . It was stated earlier that there is considerable unevenness in the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new conception of lucation . Even where the school has taken over many of these activities , moreover , it seems evident that it has not yet ndertaken complete responsibility for socializing the child in these multifarious ways . On the other hand , it is quite lear that the new concept of education involves the school in a much larger proportion of the total process of socializa- // tion than heretofore , and that , correspondingly , the role of the family has been reduced.25 The school in the status system Warner , Havighurst and Loeb state that one of the functions of the American education system is to select and train children for social mobility.26 Since upward mobility is a dominant , perhaps the dominant , theme in the ethos of the middle class , it is not surprising to find this theme closely related to the function of education in general and to the concept of manners in particular . One anthropologist has observed that the most direct technique for the achievement of upward social mobility lies in the acquisition of overt behavior or manners of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general have looked upon the educational institution as providing the ladder of upward mobility . In Chapter 4 we noted the sub-cultures of social classes . The farther one aspires to move away from his class of origin , the more alien will be the sub-culture of his new class . Accordingly , his parents are not equipped to indoctrinate him in the sub-culture of his class of destination . This function of socialization with respect to the overt manifestations of class , or " manners , " must come from other sources than the family for those who are to be upwardly mobile . These observations render meaningful the great importance attached to the nonacademic pursuits of the college student . THE FUNCTIONS OF SOCIALIZATION AND SECURITY 15S They also help to explain the popularity , and , indeed , the very existence , of books on etiquette . The increased prolongation and diversification of education has tended to create a gulf between succeeding generations . So far as the intellectual content of education is concerned , the subject matter undergoes such radical revision from generation to generation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the direction of his child 's training . When we add the indoctrination in the culture of a higher-class level , the ground of interests common to parent and child is greatly reduced.28 The public school system in this country has generally expressed the value system of the middle class . In so doing it has frequently assumed values and motivations which have little meaning for lower-class children . This observation accounts , in part , for the special difficulties between teachers and pupils in lower-class areas , for the relatively low achievement levels in these areas , and for the high mortality rates in school enrollment.29 Warner and his associates have summarized the relation between school , family , and social mobility : Most children are trained by home and neighbourhood to occupy the social positions to which they are born . The school oilers some opposition to home and neighborhood training in the case of the lower-class children , but usually fights a losing battle over them . It supports and supplements the home and neighborhood training of middle-class children . It tends to // democratize the training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to private schools which give them a class education.3o Socialization and the media of mass communication The family and the school have been socializing children for centuries , but the media of mass communication had to await the necessary technological developments before they could make their contribution . In this context , there are two major questions which may be asked about the media of mass communication : How many children do the various media reach ; and with what effect , or how , do the media influence the process of socialization ? There have been studies to determine the extent of " exposure " of children to the various media . On the question of effect , however , far more speculations than data are available . Focussing our attention for the moment on the first question , we find that little has been done to determine the size of children 's audiences at movies since the studies of the Payne Fund in the early 1930 's . From the data of these studies Edgar Dale estimated that there was an average weekly attendance at the movies of i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were approximately 25 million children between the ages of 5 and 15 in 1930 . ) It has been estimated that 90 per cent of all families own radios ; 32 consequently , the vast majority of American children have access to radios . Reports on the actual listening time of children show considerable variation . Writing before the advent of television , Herzog summarized studies showing a range of average weekly listening times of children of from five and a quarter to eighteen and a half hours.33 Availability of a television // receiver appears to reduce both movie attendance and radio listening of children . According to one report the average weekly viewing time of children in homes equipped with television is more than 2 i hours per week.34 From studies on school children in Roselle , New Jersey , it is reported that when the I.Q. is held constant , children without television sets receive grades that average 19 per cent higher than those of children with sets.3 ' In our present state of knowledge it is not possible to generalize very precisely about the effect of any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from exposing children to movies which in the experimenters ' judgments should have had a predictable effect . For example , a group of students in the ninth through the eleventh grades saw " Son of the Gods , " a film believed to create attitudes favorable to the Chinese . Attitudes measured before and after the showing revealed the expected increase in favorable responses ; follow-up tests after five and nineteen months showed that , while the group 's attitudes were less favorable to the Chinese than immediately after the showing , they were substantially more favorable than before the students had seen the film.36 In a qualitative analysis of children 's responses to movies Blumer speaks of " emotional possession " ? a vicarious experience which , because of the strength of the identification , Itnost ceases to be vicarious . Blumer concludes that movies ffect the overt play and the fantasies of children , that they rovide children and adolescents as well as adults with both notional surcease and stimulation , and that they give inruction on a variety of topics , such as manners , love-making , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emotional impact on children . In one study it was reported that 42 per cent of a group of children between the fourth and eighth grades stated that they worried about heroes in radio serials , and 26 per cent of them reported that they dreamed about programs.38 The effect of comic books was investigated through detailed interviews with 104 children from seven to seventeen years of age . The results were interpreted as showing that the comic books meet emotional needs of normal children , especially the need for an identification object.39 The fact that television viewing is done in the home has been construed by various writers as fostering family unity . It may be asked , however , whether the mere fact that all the family members are sitting in the same semi-lit room and looking at the same screen but not interacting with each other is a situation which tends in this direction.4o It is astonishing that so little is known in a field where there has been so much research . The data indicate that these media impinge upon the majority of American children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtly expressed attitudes ( as in the case of attitudes toward the Chinese ) and in the deeper lying psychic processes ( as in the case of dreaming about the heroes of radio serials ) . It seems beyond question that they play a role in influencing goals and patterns of behavior . It seems to follow psychologically that if they set up objects of identification , they probably also set up standards of morality . But precisely how and to what degree they influence the process of socialization remains to be determined . In any event , to the degree that they are influential in this process , mass media represent one // more agency of socialization that operates in relative independence of the family . Some parents try to act as a screening mechanism , i.e. , they allow their children to be exposed only to such movies , comics , etc. as they think are " fit " for their children 's consumption . Such parents are assisted in making their selections by organizations which rate the suitability of movies and other media for children at various ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent their children from seeing any comic books whatsoever , for exalnple . According to a previously cited study , out of the parents of 104 children there was not one who actually spoke favorably of comics . On the other hand , only 4 per cent forbade their children to read comics ; another 5 per cent practiced selective prohibition , and 91 per cent made no attempt at prohibition . Parental attitudes seemed generally to make little or no difference in the comic reading of the children . Less than 10 per cent of the children felt constrained to adopt surreptitious methods in their reading.41 It is clear that within the past generation technologic evelopments have dropped the age level at which children n have an extended range of experiences . For a long time literature has brought to children , as well as to adults , the opportunity to participate vicariously in experiences far outide the range of their daily routines . With the advent of radio , children could be passive participants before being ble to read ; with television , they can be participants withut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " agencies play their roles in e socialization of the child . The role of organized activities generally greater in the case of the urban child than in the se of the isolated rural child . It is very difficult to assess the suits of the activities of such organizations , either in terms . // of the numbers of children with whom they are in contact or in terms of the effect on the children reached . We may get a very rough idea by recalling that there are about 10 million children in each five-year group from five through nineteen . Speaking only of certain large and well-known national organizations , we find that the Boy Scouts have over 1,500,000 members , and the Girl Scouts over 1,000,000 ; the Y.M.C.A. has over 500,000 , and the Y.W.C.A. about 350,000 . In the rural field , the 4-H Clubs have enrolled over 1,750,000 members.42 While such agencies as the foregoing are expected to do their bit in contributing to character formation , and while a similar anticipation exists regarding the schools , the general expectation still seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral adult lies with the family . Such evidence as is available supports the view that the family is in fact as well as in expectation the most potent institution in this aspect of the socialization function . For example , the Character Education Inquiry of the 1920 'S revealed that the child 's conceptions of right and wrong correlated much more closely with those of his parents than with those of teachers , club leaders , etc . These results are summarized in Table 12 . A study of a group of high school seniors revealed that the opinions of the students in the general area of public policy . // showed a higher correlation with the attitudes of their parents than with those of their teachers 43 As a sidelight on the way in which at least one aspect of socialization operates within the family we may note another study which reported that the religious attitudes of a group of college students of both sexes reflected to a considerable degree the religious attitudes of their mothers , while the students tended to be relatively ignorant of the religious attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are to be aware of the full implications of the foregoing discussion for the trend in socialization in the family , we must recall some of the observations that have already been made about the family . In our discussion on the reproductive function we noted that the size of family has shrunk greatly over the past century or so ( see Table 6 , p. 115 ) . The immediate implication of this is that , while the child in the large family had considerable opportunity to learn from siblings and to be socialized in part by them , the child of today is much more frequently an " only " child , or may have one or two siblings " spaced " several years apart and hence not readily available as playmates . Table 7 ( p. 116 ) reports the number of " own children under 18 in families " in 1947 . From this table we can see that : only 30 per cent of the families had two or more children , while 22 per cent had one child ; 42 per cent of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of families with " only " children among all urban families with children was 46 per cent . t ) t her things being equal , it is clear that the only child has a greater need of his mother as a socializing influence than clues the " non-only . " But in our discussion we have seen that the proportion of married women in the labor force has . greatly increased ( see Table 3 , p. 65 ) . While we do not know precisely how many children are involved , we can see from Table 13 that in 1946 there were 3,490,000 women in the labor force with children under 17 , and that 1,240,000 of these women ( totals of columns 1 and 2 ) have children under 6 . This means that for a considerable number of children the mother is not available for most or all of the day . We have seen that the school has expanded the number of hours per day , the number of its activities , the number of years , and , most important , its conception of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought is such as to cause an undoubtedly large but unknown number of mothers to feel that they really do not know how to rear their children . The mother feels that she must " control " her child 's behavior enough to prevent his becoming " spoiled , " or at least to the degree necessary to prevent his hurting himself or being injured by the many potential i // hazards of modern life . If she has acquired any of the " new ideas " on child rearing , on the other hand , she may believe hat her " control " will prove injurious to her child 's psyche.45 Hence the mother may be willing to yield the responsibility , in part at least , to someone who bears some stamp of possessing such knowledge . As we shall see in Chapters 10 and 11 , moreover , the conditions of life for many middle-class women are such as to cause them to feel uncertain as to whether or not they wish to accept the maternal role . Thus there seems to be an appreciable trend for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family . On the other hand , the " new view " in child-rearing emhasizes the point that much of the process of personality development takes place in infancy and early childhood , say y the sixth birthday , and it is during this period that the competition of extra-familial institutions of socialization is ast . It should be noted , moreover , that there are influences which are operating to strengthen the family generally , and particularly its function of socialization . Radio listening , television viewing , and reading per se are not activities which apparently involve much interaction in the family . But through programs , articles , etc. on family relations these media have a " message " calculated to increase the degree and improve the quality of socialization in the family . We have seen that the social agencies make strenuous efforts to keep families together when they are confronted with financial and other difficulties . The schools , especially at the college level , are undertaking instruction in " family living , " the consequence of which may be to restore some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motherhood . // The function of security The concept of security implies the concept of threat , for without threat one would not be conscious of security . We become conscious of the air we breathe only when its supply is short . Life is filled with a number of threats of various kinds . Threats may be real or imaginary , sensed or not sensed . In imagination , e.g. , through superstitions , some may conceive of hazards which can not be objectively demonstrated . Young children may fail to perceive threats which are evident to their elders . Culturally speaking , we may conceive of two broad classes of threats . There are physical threats against one 's body and psychic threats against one 's self . The former are a threat against one as an organism ; the latter are against one as a social being . We may think of the function of providing security as protecting an individual against threats , whether real or imaginary , and whether or not the person is aware of them . It is the purpose of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence of the various types of insecurity ; we shall seek to understand the degree and the manner in which the family functions to provide security against these threats . Physical security Threats against the organism come from war and other forms of violence , from disease , and famine . In a mass society the basis of protection against such threats resides not in the family but in medical , military , and police organizations.44 // Only in the case of illness does the family play any significant role . Here the family 's responsibility is , on the one hand , to provide care and attention in such a way as to improve or keep up the patient 's morale , and , on the other , to provide the resources to buy the required medical services . At the lower economic levels the latter function is passed on to public assistance and to private charity . The most conspicuous example of the family 's providing physical security is with repect to the young child who has yet to learn responses apl ; opriate to various kinds of physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be quite rare . In general , such societies have relief rganizations to prevent starvation . As we have seen , bower , " Allison Davis regards anxiety about food and shelter characteristic of the lower class . He has pointed out , moreover , that reciprocal claims and responsibilities exist rough the extended family at this level , and hence , that c family functions to provide security for its members . It ems probable that if this type of anxiety were more wideread through American society , there would develop a rrespondingly broad network of claims and responsibilities the interest of mutual aid at the other class levels . These marks should not be taken to mean that there is an abtice of widespread anxiety in American society over money , tit this , as we shall see , is primarily related to status and iieral psychic security rather than to fear of starvation . Psychic security The nature and condition of psychic security is a topic of // too great scope to be given systematic treatment here . It will be our purpose merely to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for psychic security can be laid in infancy and early childhood . In the first few years the child has a variety of physical and social needs which , because of his helplessness and dependency , he is unable to gratify himself . The way in which these needs are gratified by family members ( in terms of regularity , promptness , positively or negatively toned affect , etc. ) contributes to the child 's sense of being wanted and hence to his psychic security . As the child becomes socialized there are numerous factors which conduce to a state of psychic security : uniformity of reward and punishment , general stability in social relationships , continuity of contact ' with the same persons and predictability of their responses to one 's own behavior , acceptance into congeniality groups , training which enables him to meet contingencies and prepares him for later roles , a value system which allows him to bring accomplishments into reasonable approximation with aspirations , a culture which allows some approved outlets for tensions ( sex , aggression , etc . ) . The extent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form determines his prospects for psychic insecurity . Culture and security All cultures are so organized as to produce some degree of psychic security , 48 but the apparent qualitative and quantitative differences among them in this respect are very great . I t is reported , for example , that among the the Comanche 40 and the Samoans 50 the security level is quite high , while among the Alorese 51 and the Manus 52 it is low . The Samoan culture // appears not to create much emotional tension ; the Comanche are very predatory and much of their tension is discharged in culturally approved aggression against out-groups . The Manus and Alorese cultures are reported as creating tension , but as lacking adequate techniques for its release . From the foregoing we should expect differences in kind and intensity of psychic security and insecurity among the sub-cultures of a complex society . Allison Davis has noted that the insecurities of lower-class people differ qualitatively from those of the middle class , the former focussing about food and shelter , while the latter concern the achievement of status and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been noted by Claudia Lewis who compared one group of children in New York City with another in the Tenncessee mountains and reported that the latter appeared to have considerably more security.J4 In addition to inter-cultural tul intra-cultural differences it is a matter of common obseration that there are marked individual differences among persons of similar background and mode of life . There are two prominent aspects of American culture which facilitate the development of psychic insecurity : its complexity and its competitiveness . When a man is dependent upon a self-sufficient farm , his economic difficulties canl be attributed to a very limited number of rather easily comprehended sources : effort , climate , soil . When he is dependent upon an industrial economy and subject to the catastrophic consequences of depressions or other economic conditions , such as those related to technological and seasonal change , he may blame his difficulties on the " system . " But " system " is merely the name covering a network of extremely complicated relationships beyond the comprehension of the worker . It requires sophistication of a high or- // der , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricate relationships between the movement of an armored column in Korea and a lay-off of workers in Keokuk . More generally stated , the psychic insecurity envisaged here is a consequence of the complexity of the socio-economic organization and its responsiveness to a multitude of influences which the individual worker can neither understand nor foresee . The individualistic , competitive ethos of American culture is a fertile field for the development of feelings of insecurity . The " American dream " embraces the concept of " self-realization , " individually and competitively achieved . Achievement is measured in part through the improvement of status . By the nature of the case there is a limited number of higher socio-economic statuses for a large number of competitors , and therefore some must be frustrated in their striving . But the individualistic emphasis implies that such failure is evidence of weakness , ineptitude , and a host of other unfortunate personal qualities . Such an implication is conducive to feelings of personal inferiority and psychic insecurity . The combination of individualism and competitiveness in American culture combines to create a sense of isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horney later in this chapter and which will be developed at greater length in connection with the concept of " separation anxiety . " The impersonal nature of urban relationships , the anonymity of the city , tends further to foster feelings of isolation and to stimulate psychic insecurity and a need to " belong . " Another aspect of American culture which is conducive to psychic insecurity is the relative lack of function assigned to the aged . In the self-sufficient farm family they had greater security than today . Not only has their economic significance ebbed with the growing concept of categorical employability , but the convictions have developed that pal ents and offspring should have separate residences , and that each generation should take care of itself once adulthood is // reached . Add to these considerations the fact that the trend toward smaller families means that there are fewer offspring over whom the cost of maintaining dependent parents can be spread , and we have some of the crucial facts which make old age a " problem . " In the upper class these remarks do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper class is economically well-off and the maintenance of its members is not a " burden . " Since its economic base is characteristically in property , and since the title to property is retained in the stands of elders , their socio-economic status is high and their security is not threatened . Moreover , since status is derived rimarily from kinship rather than from occupation , the family provides security for all its members . ( Under the heading of " Physical security " we considered the special case f the lower-class family and noted that , with respect to the incept of mutual aid , it offered its members a type of security not general in the middle class . ) The nature of psychic insecurity in our culture It is difficult to define psychic security but not to observe gns of psychic insecurity . " Feelings of inferiority and inadequacy . . . a conviction of incompetence , of stupidity , or attractiveness " 56 are subjective symptoms of psychic insecurity . In behavior it may be revealed in excessive deands on others for approval and affection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as freedom from such subjective and objective symptoms . In c following paragraphs we shall note a few of the conditions which are conducive to psychic security and insecurity , d particularly , how the family contributes toward the development of both . As we shall see in Chapters 8-lo , the family contributes in many ways to the development of the child 's personality . rough sternness and regularity of discipline , amount and . // kind of affection expressed , etc. , it affects the amount of security or insecurity which the child will have as he leaves the family to enter peer-groups at play and at school ; to a lesser degree , it contributes to the security of the adolescent as he enters adulthood . As the dependence of the child wanes , as he becomes more able to take care of himself , he spends more of his time outside the home in the company of playmates , schoolmates , fellow club- and gang-members , etc . Extrafamilial peer-groups become an increasingly important part of the child 's social world , and hence become progressively prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child emerges from the home and joins at play a group of his mates , he confronts a new set of expectations , a new set of criteria in terms of which to evaluate his adequacy . In his interaction outside the home the child , and later the adult , meets an ever-shifting set of standards . At one age he may be judged by the fidelity of his representation of a cowboy hero ; at another , by his prowess at baseball ; at still another , by his ability with girls , by his " smoothness " with the boss , etc . It is by no means certain that a child who is proficient in meeting cultural expectations and derives recognition , approval , and security at one age level will do so at a later age or in adulthood , when confronted with different standards . We may anticipate a later discussion by noting that , in part , this situation is a consequence of the existence of " cultural discontinuities , " or the fact that the experiences at one age level do not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected at the next level . Among current psychiatric theories there are interpretations of the nonorganic neuroses and psychoses in terms of the stresses and strains of daily living and the consequent threats to psychic security . It is commonly believed that such mental disorders are on the increase , but this belief has // not been conclusively demonstrated . ' Such an increase would be consistent with the hypothesized relation between the complexity of the social order and mental disease . Some psychiatrists , especially those with a Freudian orientation , look to familial experiences in early childhood as the basic source of emotional disorder which occurs in adulthood . It oes seem plausible , on the other hand , that the nature of experiences in adult life may determine whether or not curosis will occur ; or , to put it another way , whether or not n adult will suffer a neurosis may depend upon whether or of his experiences precipitate a " breakdown , " the condiions for which were laid down in childhood . This may be xcmplified by studies of " combat neuroses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their patients had developed psychic insecurity within the family setting early in eir lives . But the strong fear and anxiety involved in court undoubtedly precipitated neurotic symptoms in those who , under less stressful conditions , might never have shown them . In the sub-culture of the American middle class it is likely at job and family will be the major sources of gratification d security ; but they can also be major sources of insecurity . he job is the source of income , the determiner of status , d hence the locus of one kind of security or insecurity . r culture defines the lover , marital , and parent-child reionships as the most appropriate sources of affection and e , of reassurance and response , and hence of another kind security . The security arising from the job situation comes from competition and achievement . The security sing from the family comes from love and acceptance . the job , as well as on the playground , in the school and 5. // gang , recognition tends to go to the able competitor . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some families , but not all , recognition and affection are given to each member simply because he belongs to the family ? ascribed , in other words , because of kinship . Basically , there is a qualitative difference between these two kinds of security . To facilitate the discussion let us designate the one based on achievement as " status security , " and the other based on affection and response as " interpersonal security . " There is a cultural expectation that a well-balanced person will seek both kinds . Some persons , however , emphasize one more than the other ; some seek to exploit one as a compensation for failure in the other . No doubt it is the compulsively striving person who , disliking and distrusting people , aspires to gratification and security solely from his job ? status security ; and it is the passive-dependent person who seeks to derive gratification solely from family relationships ? interpersonal security . ( Our cultural expectations concerning sex-roles are that men will deviate in the former direction and women in the latter . ) In a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foregoing interpretation is overdrawn . The family situation frequently manifests competition , especially among siblings , and the work situation frequently provides the counterpart of the parent-child and sibling relationships ( between superior and subordinate , and among workers at the same level , respectively ) . There is an emphasis in man types of work situations on having a " pleasing personality ' and " selling oneself . " For example , in certain types of sal work the salesman 's achievement seems to depend upon di degree to which his " prospects like " him . The familial so of relationship is evident in McGregor 's statement that : " S curity for subordinates is possible only when they know the have the genuine approval of their superior . " " . // It has been noted that status security and interpersonal security are somewhat independent , but that one may be used as a compensation for a deficiency in the other . When a family member meets rebuff on the job or the playground , therefore , the opportunity arises for other members of the family to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition . This is a point at which the family can do much in buttressing psychic security and generally make the home seem a haven from the cruel practices of the outside world . Ways of alleviating insecurity outside the family Religion is the most ancient and widely known way of providing security on a society-wide basis . Psychologically speaking , the basis of religion is faith . The kinds of faith and the kinds of supernatural phenomena believed in vary from culture to culture . One writer has suggested that the ature of communal anxieties and insecurities can be inferred from the form and content of the group 's religion . Among the Alorese , for example , the nature of social relationships is accurately reflected in the fact that " the individual acts toward the deity as if he were an insistent creditor whom he would rather not pay off . " This conception of the deity is a reflection of the very important creditor-debtor relationships among the Alorese. i0 Similarly , magic provides an adjustment to the condition psychic insecurity . Among the Saulteaux , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the culture ovides little opportunity for such feelings to be translated to overt action . The typical individual , moreover , believes at others hate him . Here the faith exists that through the of sorcery and magic one may injure and even dispose of ? // his enemies without engaging in any overtly hostile act . The faith in magic and sorcery is so strong that white doctors are unable to cure a patient whose illness has been " sent by someone . " 61 It appears , however , that in the present setting religion has lost its power to assuage insecurity for a considerable number of people . This represents what one writer has called " deterioration in belief . " 62 Concomitant with the loss of faith in the supernatural in ' Western countries has been a growth in the faith that , through organization , men can control their natural environment , and also to some degree their own destiny . In this belief the conception of post-mortem rewards is replaced by a conception of rewards achievable in this life . In other words , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of an earthly utopia ; ideology succeeds theology . Instead of deriving security from the deity , the individual tries to achieve it through political parties , leaders , and protest groups . Writers have frequently remarked the psychological equivalence of the Nazi and Communist movements on the one hand and religion on the other . Common to the religious and political ideologies noted above are a faith in the power , actual or potential , of the thing believed in and a sense of being a part of , or " belonging " to , something greater than oneself . The persistence of such beliefs throughout recorded history is testimony to their ability to reassure the individual and to serve as an antidote to psychic insecurity . In a more limited way this seems to // be a part of the psychic drive behind the great American impulsion to " join " groups and organizations . American culture is studded with great numbers of voluntary associations , and it is clear that our people derive gratification from " belonging " to lodges , fraternities , labor unions , service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . Such groups may or may not be congeniality groups . For example , membership in honorary societies bestows recognition and therefore status security , but not affection and response . On the other hand , a social group in a neighborhood tavern tends to operate on the affective and response level , and therefore to confer interpersonal security . In the United States and elsewhere in the Western world sychic insecurity becomes so exaggerated in a considerable , lough unknown , number of persons that they develop emotional conflicts of various degrees of seriousness . As a consequeuence , there has grown up a coterie of specialists to give help to the troubled . Psychiatrists and psychoanalysts , cliniI and counseling psychologists , and social case workers are I engaged in the endeavor to try to re-establish the security f their troubled patients and clients . " Insecurity , the need for love , and the need to belong As Horney observes , fear and insecurity plus the explicit competitiveness and implicit hostility in our culture result feelings of isolation . Part of the task of achieving psychic // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belonging " and " loving , " or , more precisely , being allowed to lx ' - long and being loved , are techniques commonly used in relieving the sense of isolation and insecurity . It is obvious that love is usually sought in an intimate relationship , that such relationships are frequently those of husband and wife or of lovers who aspire to marry and start a family , and that they give promise of gratifying both the need for love and the need to belong . It is emotional isolation which provokes , in the normal individual of our time , an intensified need for affection as a remedy . Obtaining affection makes him feel less isolated , less threatened by hostility and less uncertain of himself . Because it corresponds to a vital need , love is over-valued in our culture . It becomes a phantom ? like success ? carrying with it the illusion that it is a solution for all problems . Love itself is not an illusion ? although in our culture it is most often a screen for satisfying wishes that have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion by our expecting much more of it than it can possibly fulfill . And the ideological emphasis that we place on love serves to cover up the factors which create our exaggerated need for it . Hence the individual ? and I still mean the normal individual ? is in the dilemma of needing a great deal of affection but finding difficulty in obtaining it.65 Summary : security and the other functions of the family Our discussion of the economic function concluded that the family had in considerable measure ceased to be an economic unit , that , with the rise of the concept of categorical employability family members had come to be either " de- // dependents " or " gainfully employed , " and hence , that a very important bond of interdependence had been lost from the family . While upper-class persons and children and wives of all classes , rural and urban , derive socio-economic status from the family , moreover , urban men ( the most usually " gainfully employed " family members ) of the middle and ewer classes derive such status from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that families cre becoming smaller , and that one in seven completed famlies had no children .
