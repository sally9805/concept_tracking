Without fuss or bitterness , the segregated public schools of St. Louis were smoothly integrated four years ago . Children were ordered to attend schools in their own neighborhoods , and no transfers were allowed . But that effective formula ( also followed in Washington , D.C. ) re-emphasized a sad , subtle U.S. segregation of another kind . In 14 major cities , from Boston to Los Angeles , it blights 25% to 35% of 3,200,000 children in public schools . Worried schoolmen call it " the problem of the culturally handicapped . " They mean the mental ghettos in which thousands of dispirited Negro children live because no one-teachers or parents-can stir them to care . <P> With poignant force , the problem hit St. Louis ' energetic , earnest Dr. Samuel Shepard Jr . two years ago . A Negro , he had risen from abject poverty in Kansas City . Mo. , put himself through the University of Michigan by scullery work . He climbed steadily in the St. Louis public-school system , first as teacher and athletic coach , later as principal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sam Shepard is willing to work three times harder than anyone else , " one of them says . " He stays with a problem like a dog on a bone , until he gets the job done . " By 1952 Sam Shepard , a district director of education , headed 22 of the city 's 130 still segregated grade schools . His charges : 13,000 students ( only 1,000 of them whites ) who live in the squalid middle of the city 's sleaziest neighborhoods . <P> No Excuses . Shepard knew perfectly well what their surroundings meant to his students ' morale , and tests given to all the city 's students two years after integration confirmed his worst fears . All his eighth-grade children proved at least a year behind the median norm in reading , language , arithmetic-and only 7% of those about to enter high school were eligible for " top-track " work . <P> Shepard 's teachers pleaded crowded classrooms and the children 's poverty . But Shepard was tired of excuses . Drive , desire and ambition , he snapped , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He called parents together in meeting after meeting prescribed homework and more homework , sparked them to want to boost their children 's grades . If parents were too uneducated to help with studies , he said frankly , they could at least buy dictionaries and give children a place to work . " Integration did n't put us in too good a light , " he told the parents over and over . " School is important business . We have been low man on the totem pole , and too satisfied with our lot . " <P> Look to Tomorrow . Last week , stirred and cajoled by Sam Shepard for 19 months , the children had a report card to cheer . New tests of Sam Shepard 's eighth-graders showed twice as many ( 14.8% ) ready for top-track high school work next fall . At one school , where only 28% of first-and second-graders were reading at the national norm last June , the rate had soared to 57.2% by January .               @ @ @ @ @ @
