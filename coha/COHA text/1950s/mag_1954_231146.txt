Music-proud Salzburgers hardly knew what to expect . The conductor was a sergeant : most of the 65 players were youngsters , and all wore the suntans of the U.S. <P> Army . But the program was solid , symphonic fare , and as it progressed , the performance compared favorably with good European orchestras . When it was over the audience applauded long and loud . <P> The three-year-old Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra , the only full symphony orchestra in the *Army , - had just won itself and the occupying forces some new friends . Their success was no surprise to orchestra members . " We are , " says one , " the best lowest-paid orchestra in the world . " No Army brass , and little of its rank and file , thought in the spring of 1952 that the occupation forces needed a symphony orchestra . But , according to the story now favored by the orchestra members , the Seventh Army 's Lieut . General Manton S. Eddy got tired of being ribbed by his German friends about the cackle of hillbilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he heard that an energetic young corporal named Samuel Adler wanted to form an orchestra of musicians who were languishing in other Army jobs , General Eddy was enthusiastic , put his three-starred authority fully behind the venture . The following summer the outfit made a tour of Germany and even hired itself out as pit orchestra for a production of The Marriage of Figaro at the Passau festival . <P> Wornout Horn . Germans and Austrians began to eye Americans with new respect , but the orchestra played through some hard months : Conductor Adler got his discharge ; so did half of the orchestra at about the same time .

It had played its repertory almost to death ( the sound-effects man completely wore out his taxi horn on Gershwin 's An American in Paris ) , and at some performances the concert hall all but emptied for good at intermission time . But the New York Philharmonic-Symphony 's Conductor Dimitri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander of U.S. <P> Army forces in Europe , and told him that with a little attention the Seventh Army 's mediocre orchestra could be an excellent one . The result : 26 new men were transferred to fill out the orchestra , and last spring a new conductor , Sergeant Kenneth Schermerhorn , was chosen . <P> Last May the orchestra started on its 1954 tour of camps and civilian halls with its morale the highest and its playing the best ever . <P> Bird Sanctuary . The average age of the symphony 's 65 players is 22 . Conductor Schermerhorn himself is a fairly typical member of the orchestra : he is 24 , comes from Schenectady , studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and Tanglewood , has played trumpet in Boston and Kansas City orchestras .
