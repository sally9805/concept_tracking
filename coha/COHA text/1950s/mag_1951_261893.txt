Mount Lamington is a 5,534-ft. volcano in the Owen-Stanley range , New Guinea . White residents call it the " Marx Brothers , " because it has four cones ; natives know it as " Spirit Mountain , " from a legend that it once breathed fire . <P> Airline Pilot Russell Bidulph , flying a C-47 from Port Moresby to Lae , looked down on Lamington . Said Bidulph later : " It seemed to cough , and in an instant there was a Bikini-like cloud above it . " In a single blast the whole northern side of the peak had blown up . The black cloud , " full of streaks of red lightning , " boiled up to 50,000 feet , mushroomed 100 miles wide . Not molten lava , but pumice dust and hot scoria ( like clinkers from a furnace ) flew out of the crater , making the earth for miles around too hot to live in . <P> Eight years ago , Americans and Australians fought the Japanese around Lamington . After the war it became again an area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites , mostly Australian government officials and missionaries , and 4,400 natives , all but 400 of them Christians , lived there . When the non-Christian natives recently began predicting that the Spirit Mountain would again spew fire and death , the mission natives scoffed at the " barbarians . " But the barbarians went away . <P> The first rescue teams to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash to an airstrip near Lamington last week reported at least 50 square miles of formerly jungle-clad hills now a grey-brown desert of pumice dust caking into stone . Said one rescuer : " It was like being on another planet ... The haze of steam and smoke issuing from Lamington made the whole thing a nightmare . " Said Australian Government Official Claude Champion : " Native bodies were everywhere . Dead natives were hanging in the stripped branches of every tree , and many were caught in the forks of the trees . Apparently they died there after they had climbed up to escape from the hot ground . " Only 150 natives were found alive , and these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh from their bones . " There were 35 white survivors , as many dead . <P> Fearing a second blast , the Australian government ordered all rescuers and investigators out of the area . At week 's end the second eruption came , blowing volcanic dust five miles into the air .
