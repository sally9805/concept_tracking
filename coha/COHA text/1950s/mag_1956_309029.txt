Oaken-hearted Konrad Adenauer , who has won a lot of political victories by force of character and the iron logic of his policies , came through again last week , but not without difficulties . His normally ashen face lightly tanned after a long Swiss vacation , he took autocratic command of his Christian Democratic Union 's annual conference at Stuttgart and sought to silence all talk of picking his successor or changing his policies . <P> " What Alternatives ? " When the time came to choose party officers , the old ( 80 ) Chancellor acted as both chairman and nominating committee . He proposed his slate , ignored all hands raised against it , and announced amid gasps : " As nearly as I can see , it 's unanimous . " When the time came to lay down doctrine , Adenauer announced that the party would fight the 1957 elections on the same reunification plank as in 1953 : " We hold fast to the policy of integration of Europe and the Atlantic community . " It was folly to think that Germany could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen , believe me , we are not at all liked in the world yet . " <P> Turning on those members who think he should climb down and ask Moscow 's price for German unity , he growled : " After the results of the London negotiations there can no longer be any man in Germany who thinks the time has come to begin something with the Russians . " Though many delegates felt that the old man 's foreign policy had not borne fruit , only one dared openly to question its inflexibility . When Berlin Deputy Ferdinand Friedensburg suggested in an almost painfully respectful little speech that perhaps Germany should have alternative policies on reunification , the Chancellor leaped to the rostrum with the agility of a man of 50 . He shook a stubby finger at Friedensburg and roared : " What alternatives ? " <P> The Old Soft Shoe . On foreign policy der Alte was plainly on the defensive . With next year 's elections in mind , the Christian Democrats were dreaming up some vote-getting domestic measures in stead . Usually , at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his annual spring masquerade as the national miser . He puts on his shawl and oldest pair of shoes , bums a cigarette from his chauffeur and totters onstage to wail that the country is bound for the poorhouse unless he gets a few billions more to balance his budget . This year Schffer , who bows to no man as a politician , has a tounded his audience by capering out and saying he is ready to cut taxes by $300 million , even after promising a cool billion for new farm subsidies . And how will he raise it ? It 's an open secret in Bonn that he will just get the Chancellor to let him use the greater part of the $2.1 billion earmarked for defense spending this year . The new army is so far behind schedule , all agree , that it could not spend the money anyway . <P> The New Allies . Such surefire schemes may well see the Christian Democrats safely through the 1957 elections . But the old political scene is fast changing . Adenauer once had the most impressive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 487 ) , but it has been whittled down to 281 votes , and many who vote for him are restive .
