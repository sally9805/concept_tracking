Step by painful step , pilots are learning how to land their aircraft in the foulest weather . Latest step : Hitching electronic landing systems to the automatic pilot , known to service pilots as " George . " <P> Two electronic instrument-landing methods are already in practical use . One , ILS ( InstrumentLanding System ) , projects into the sky a narrow beam of high-frequency radio waves . Slanting at a gentle angle , the beam forms a " glide path " which an airplane equipped with the proper instruments can follow down through the fog . <P> The other system , GCA ( Ground-Controlled Approach ) , watches the approaching airplane through the fog by radar . Operators , who know exactly where the airplane is at all times , coach the pilot by voice radio and " talk him down . " <P> Prompt Response . Both systems put a severe strain on the pilot . Besides flying his airplane and watching intently for the first sight of the ground below , he must also watch the ILS instruments or listen to the GCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . When the plane gets near the ground , both landing systems abandon it . The pilot must make the final approach and landing himself , though the visibility may still be too poor for him to see the ground properly . With the pilot 's attention so completely occupied , any emergency , such as minor mechanical trouble , is more likely to develop into an accident . <P> Designers of landing systems hope that most of the disadvantages can be eliminated by the automatic pilot . Already the autopilot flies many airliners on long , boring hops , keeping them on course by its own gyroscopic control of the aircraft . It responds more promptly than a human pilot . Instrument men believe that it could be made to listen for electronic orders and follow them down to the ground . <P> George can probably do it . Experimentally at least , the automatic pilot has been hitched to both ILS and GCA . When following the ILS glide path , George accepts electronic signals from the ground and nudges the airplane 's controls to keep it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch the plane 's flying instruments and to monitor the whole operation . <P> Toward the Touchdown . George can be used with GCA too . In one such system designed by Gilfillan Bros. , Inc. , a radar picks up the approaching airplane and automatically sends out coded orders to put it on the desired glide path . George translates the orders into the proper movements of the airplane 's wheel and throttle , and steers the plane down toward the field . The system can keep track of six incoming airplanes simultaneously . If one of them has no automatic equipment , it can be talked down by voice . <P> Additional equipment will allow George to make the actual touchdown . One gadget , for use with ILS , is a sensitive altimeter that tells George when the airplane is close to the ground . Then George flattens the approach angle so that the touchdown will be gentle . With the GCA system , a special short-range radar does much the same thing , guiding the plane with extra precision just before it hits the runway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical use , but instrument men believe that one or both of them will some day solve the blind-landing problem .
