txt Suppose the government undertook to buy all automobiles the manufacturers could n't sell . Ploduction would spurt and the government would quickly be deluged . In self-defense it would limit production : to , say , three million cars a yeat . In selfItlefense , the manufacturers would ? turn their ' excess capacity to the making of , say , doinicnobs . But suppose further that the government-had also agreed to ' buy up surlplus - doorknobs . It would quickly have to curtail production of these too . Arid Pao on until it had limited the output of everything the auto makers could think of to make . Well , before this process got very far Along , . the ' public , including the auto men , would be screaming about Federal regimentation , high prices . high taxes land a few other things . The members of Congress who voted for such ' a law would be persuaded to ditch it or face removed at the earliest electoral opportunity . Yet , , as Mr. Tanner reported from Washington in - this newspaper yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he struggles to carry out the present farm law . Inflexible ninety percent of parity price supports on the basic crops have encouraged staggering surpluses . To slow this rapidly-accelerating accumulation somewhat , Mr. Benson ordered growers of wheat , corn and cotton  --  three of the basics  --  either to take some thirty million acres out of production this year  --  or lose price support on them . Most complied with the restriction , but many planted crops such as barley , oats and rye instead , and now huge surpluses of these threaten . So now Mr. Benson is considering ordering farmers not to plant any price-supported commodity in the diverted acres in the coming crop year . That raises the possibility of diversion to vegetables , which mostly are not price-propped . To avert the specter of mountains of excess beans and onions , the Agriculture Department is toying with the idea of telling farmers they ca n't grow , on their diverted land , anything that would make money . There is pathos in Mr. Benson 's plight , for Mr. Benson is a man who sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control on control on more and more of them . To that end he has proposed modification in the price-support features of the present law . But there is more than pathos . There is also something of a mystery why no great public ' outcry has been raised at this shackling of the farmer , this fraud on the consumer , this robbing of the taxpayer . At the moment some $6.5 billion of the taxpayer 's money is tied up in keeping the price of food high , and some officials fear the figure may be $10. billion in another year . Since food is more meaningful to most people than cars or doorknobs or anything else , one might suppose the members of Congress would be furiously amending this scandalous system . In fact , the farm bloc is apparently determined to do its best to perpetuate the present law beyond its scheduled expiration at the end of this year , thus opening further vistas of unmanageable surpluses , high prices , high taxes and regimentation . Perhaps one explanation of the general apathy is that people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full import of the present situation . has not yet registered . It evidently has not yet registered on the gentlemen who wrote the law .
