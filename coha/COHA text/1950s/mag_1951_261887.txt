In the spring of 1946 , a little man named Hussein Ala , envoy from Iran , stood before the U.N . Security Council and unflinchingly insisted that the Russian army get out of his country . Sullenly , the Red army withdrew . The Communist puppet government of Azerbaijan in northern Iran collapsed . This was the first important postwar setback for Communist aggression-and the first great post-war symbol of the free world 's strength . Thoughtful men , while they rejoiced , realized that the victory would be empty unless the U.S. moved rapidly to aid Iran , which was economically prostrate and politically shaky . <P> Five years later , the vast reservoir of nope and trust created in Iran is running dry . The danger from Russia today is greater than in 1946 . The present Iran picture is one of all-round distrust between Americans , British and Iranians . Desperately and suicidally , the Iranians are back in an old game that they can not win-trying to play the Russians off against the Western powers . Divided and discouraged , Iran lies defenseless-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the Communists grab Iran , they will get an asset far more valuable than Korea . Through Iran lie Russia 's paths to the rest of the Middle East oil : the great fields of Iraq and Arabia , and the Bahrein-Sidon , Kirkuk-Haifa and Kirkuk-Tripoli pipelines ( see map ) . With U.S. encouragement , Western Europe depends more &; more on Middle East rather than Western Hemisphere oil . This shift is economically and strategically sensible , provided that the Western powers intend to defend the Middle East . Fact is , however , that they show no serious sign of such an intention . Turkey is the only country in the area whose defenses are in good shape and Turkey can be outflanked by a Soviet thrust through northern Iran and around to Turkey 's southern frontier . The historic invasion road to India also lies through Iran . Yet no effort is being made or even planned for coordinating the defenses of the Middle East nations . <P> TIME Correspondent Enno Hobbing recently toured Iran , strategic key to the whole region . The following report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . <P> " I Can Teach My Father . " Revolutions usually take place while things are getting better , but not getting better fast enough . Iranians have seen something of Western ways and techniques . They are learning rapidly that their misery is unnecessary , their lot unjust . This means that Iran is not only poverty-stricken and disease-ridden ; it is also in a ferment of insecurity that runs from the peasant in his windowless hovel to the young Shah in his palace . Everybody knows that the future will be very different , but nobody has any confidence that the immediate future will be better for him . Unless economic improvement is speeded up unless the people get a real political stake in their country , Communism will reap in Iran what Western influence and Western aid sowed . <P> Western influence-both as progress and as ferment-is most conspicuous in the capital , Teheran ( pop . almost 1,000,000 ) . Some sections have wide boulevards and modernistic buildings ; in others , narrow streets run between mud-brick hovels . Cadillacs and ratty taxis run through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
