When we published Carl Jacobi 's last story we had no assurance he would be with us so soon again . For when a uniquely gifted science-fantasy writer becomes radio-active on the entertainment meter and goes voyaging into the unknown , he may be gone from the world we know for as long as yesterday 's tomorrow . But Carl Jacobi has not only returned almost with the speed of light  --  he has brought with him shining new nuggets of wonder and surmise. the long voyage by ... Carl Jacobi The secret lay hidden at the end of nine landings , and Medusa-dark was one man 's search for it  --  in the strangest journey ever made . A soft gentle rain began to fall as we emerged from the dark woods and came out onto the shore . There it was , the sea , stretching as far as the eye could reach , gray and sullen , and flecked with green-white froth . The blue hensorr trees , crowding close to the water 's edge , were bent backward as if frightened by the bleakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches of water , was a bleached white like the exposed surface of a huge bone . We stood there a moment in silence . Then Mason cleared his throat huskily . " Well , here goes , " he said . " We 'll soon see if we have any friends about . " He unslung the packsack from his shoulders , removed its protective outer shield and began to assemble the organic surveyor , an egg-shaped ball of white carponium secured to a segmented forty-foot rod . While Brandt and I raised the rod with the aid of an electric fulcrum , Mason carefully placed his control cabinet on a piece of outcropping rock and made a last adjustment . The moment had come . Even above the sound of the sea , you could hear the strained breathing of the men . Only Navigator Norris appeared unconcerned . He stood there calmly smoking his pipe , his keen blue eyes squinting against the biting wind . Mason switched on the speaker . Its high-frequency scream rose deafeningly above us and was torn away in unsteady gusts . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter circle , and then all the way to the final backstop of the calibration . All that resulted was a continuation of that mournful ululation like a wail out of eternity . Mason tried again . With stiff wrists he tuned while perspiration stood out on his forehead , and the rest of us crowded close . " It 's no use , " he said . " This pickup failure proves there is n't a vestige of animal life on Stragella  --  on this hemisphere of the planet , at least . " Navigator Norris took his pipe from his mouth and nodded . His face was expressionless . There was no indication in the man 's voice that he had suffered another great disappointment , his sixth in less than a year . " We 'll go back now , " he said , " and we 'll try again . There must be some planet in this system that 's inhabited . But it 's going to be hard to tell the women . " Mason let the surveyor rod down with a crash . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Mason was the youngest of our party and the leader of the antagonistic group that was slowly but steadily undermining the authority of the Navigator . This was our seventh exploratory trip after our sixth landing since entering the field of the sun Ponthis . Ponthis with its sixteen equal-sized planets , each with a single satellite . First there had been Coulora ; then in swift succession , Jama , Tenethon , Mokrell , and R-9 . And now Stragella . Strange names of strange worlds , revolving about a strange star . It was Navigator Norris who told us the names of these planets and traced their positions on a chart for us . He alone of our group was familiar with astrogation and cosmography . He alone had sailed the spaceways in the days before the automatic pilots were installed and locked and sealed on every ship . A handsome man in his fortieth year , he stood six feet three with broad shoulders and a powerful frame . His eyes were the eyes of a scholar , dreamy yet alive with depth and penetration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he governed our company with an iron hand . He was not perfect , of course . Like all Earthmen , he had his faults . Months before he had joined with that famed Martian scientist , Ganeth-Klae , to invent that all-use material , Indurate , the formula for which had been stolen and which therefore had never appeared on the commercial market . Norris would talk about that for hours . If you inadvertently started him on the subject a queer glint would enter his eyes , and he would dig around in his pocket for a chunk of the black substance . " Did I ever show you a piece of this ? " he would say . " Look at it carefully . Notice the smooth grainless texture  --  hard and yet not brittle . You would n't think that it was formed in a gaseous state , then changed to a liquid and finally to a clay-like material that could be worked with ease . A thousand years after your body has returned to dust , that piece of Indurate will still exist , unchanged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beside it granite , steel are nothing . If only I had the formula ... " But he had only half the formula , the half he himself had developed . The other part was locked in the brain of Ganeth-Klae , and Ganeth-Klae had disappeared . What had become of him was a mystery . Norris perhaps had felt the loss more than any one , and he had offered the major part of his savings as a reward for information leading to the scientist 's whereabouts . Our party  --  eighteen couples and Navigator Norris  --  had gathered together and subsequently left Earth in answer to a curious advertisement that had appeared in the Sunday edition of the London Times . WANTED : A group of married men and women , young , courageous , educated , tired of political and social restrictions , interested in extra-terrestrial colonization . Financial resources no qualification . After we had been weeded out , interviewed and rigorously questioned , Norris had taken us into the hangar , waved a hand toward the Marie Galante and explained the details . The Marie Galante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain speed , but equipped with the latest of everything . For a short run to Venus , for which it was originally built , it would accommodate a passenger list of ninety . But Norris was n't interested in that kind of run . He had knocked out bulkheads , reconverted music room and ballroom into living quarters . He had closed and sealed all observation ports , so that only in the bridge cuddy could one see into space . " We shall travel beyond the orbit of the sun , " he said . " There will be no turning back ; for the search for a new world , a new life , is not a task for cowards . " Aside to me , he said : " You 're to be the physician of this party , Bagley . So I 'm going to tell you what to expect when we take off . We 're going to have some mighty sick passengers aboard then . " " What do you mean , sir ? " I said . He pointed with his pipe toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , call it a booster . Ganeth-Klae designed it just before he disappeared , using the last lot of Indurate in existence . It will increase our take-off speed by five times , and it will probably have a bad effect on the passengers . " So we had left Earth , at night from a field out in Essex . Without orders , without clearance papers , without an automatic pilot check . Eighteen couples and one navigator  --  destination unknown . If the Interstellar Council had known what Norris was up to , it would have been a case for the Space-Time Commission . Of that long initial lap of our voyage , perhaps the less said the better . As always is the case when monotony begins to wear away the veneer of civilization , character quirks came to the surface , cliques formed among the passengers , and gossip and personalities became matters of pre-eminent importance . Rising to the foreground out of our thirty-six , came Fielding Mason , tall , taciturn , and handsome , with a keen intellect and a sense of values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate of Montape , the French outgrowth of St. Cyr . But he had majored in military tactics , psychology and sociology and knew nothing at all about astrogation or even elemental astronomy . He too was a man of good breeding and refinement . Nevertheless conflict began to develop between him and Navigator Norris . That conflict began the day we landed on Coulora . Norris stepped out of the air lock into the cold thin air , glanced briefly about him and faced the eighteen men assembled . " We 'll divide into three groups , " he said . " Each group to carry an organic surveyor and take a different direction . Each group will so regulate its marching as to be back here without fail an hour before darkness sets in . If you find no sign of animal life , then we will take off again immediately on your return . " Mason paused halfway in the act of strapping on his packsack . " What 's that got to do with it ? " he demanded . " There 's vegetation here . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit his pipe . " If you find no sign of animal life we will take off immediately on your return , " he said as if he had n't heard . But the strangeness of Coulora tempered bad feelings then . The blue hensorr trees were actually not trees at all but a huge cat-tail-like growth , the stalks of which were quite transparent . In between the stalks grew curious cabbage-like plants that changed from red to yellow as an intruder approached and back to red again after he had passed . Rock outcroppings were everywhere , but all were eroded and in places polished smooth as glass . There was a strange kind of dust that acted as though endowed with life . It quivered when trod upon , and the outline of our footsteps slowly rose into the air , so that looking back I could see our trail floating behind us in irregular layers . Above us the star that was this planet 's sun shown bright but faintly red as if it were in the first stages of dying . The air though thin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear space suits . We marched down the corridors of hensorr trees , until we came to an open spot , a kind of glade . And that was the first time Mason tuned his organic surveyor and received absolutely nothing . There was no animal life on Coulora ! * * * * * Within an hour we had blasted off again . The forward-impact delivered by the Ganeth-Klae booster was terrific , and nausea and vertigo struck us all simultaneously . But again , with all ports and observation shields sealed shut , Norris held the secret of our destination . On July twenty-second , the ship gave that sickening lurch and came once again to a standstill . " Same procedure as before , " Norris said , stepping out of the airlock . " Those of you who desire to have their wives accompany you may do so . Mason , you 'll make a final correlation on the organic surveyors . If there is no trace of animal life return here before dark . " Once our group was out of sight of the ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boulder and lighted a cigarette . " Bagley , " he said to me , " has the Old Man gone loco ? " " I think not , " I said , frowning . " He 's one of the most evenly balanced persons I know . " " Then he 's hiding something , " Mason said . " Why else should he be so concerned with finding animal life ? " " You know the answer to that , " I said . " We 're here to colonize , to start a new life . We ca n't very well do that on a desert . " " That 's poppycock , " Mason replied , flinging away his cigarette . " When the Albertson expedition first landed on Mars , there was no animal life on the red planet . Now look at it . Same thing was true when Breslauer first settled Pluto . The colonies there got along . I tell you Norris has got something up his sleeve , and I do n't like it . " Later , after Mason had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of its fuse ! Norris had given orders to return to the Marie Galante , and the rest of us were sullenly making ready to start the back trail . Mason , however , deliberately seized his pick and began chopping a hole in the rock surface , preparatory apparently to erecting his plastic tent . " We 'll make temporary camp here , " he said calmly . " Brandt , you can go back to the ship and bring back the rest of the women . " He turned and smiled sardonically at Navigator Norris . Norris quietly knocked the ashes from his pipe and placed it in his pocket . He strode forward , took the pick from Mason 's hands and flung it away . Then he seized Mason by the coat , whipped him around and drove his fist hard against the younger man 's jaw . " When you signed on for this voyage , you agreed to obey my orders , " he said , not raising his voice . " You 'll do just that . " Mason picked himself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could have smashed Norris to a pulp , and none knew it better than the Navigator . For a brief instant the younger man swayed there on the balls of his feet , fists clenched . Then he let his hands drop , walked over and began to put on his packsack . But I had seen Mason 's face , and I knew he had not given in as easily as it appeared . Meanwhile he began to circulate among the passengers , making no offers , yet subtly enlisting backers for a policy , the significance of which grew on me slowly . It was mutiny he was plotting ! And with his personal charm and magnetism he had little trouble in winning over converts . I came upon him arguing before a group of the women one day , among them his own wife , Estelle . He was standing close to her . " We have clothing and equipment and food concentrate , " Mason said . " Enough to last two generations . We have brains and intelligence , and we certainly should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of life . " Coulora , Jama , Tenethon , Mokrell , R-9 , and Stragella . We could have settled on any one of those planets , and apparently we should have , for conditions have grown steadily worse at each landing . But always the answer is no . Why ? Because Norris says we must go on until we find animal life . " He cleared his throat and gazed at the feminine faces before him . " Go where ? What makes Norris so sure he 'll find life on any planet in this system ? And incidentally where in the cosmos is this system ? " One of the women , a tall blonde , stirred uneasily . " What do you mean ? " she said . " I mean we do n't know if our last landing was on Stragella or Coulora . I mean we do n't know where we are or where we 're going , and I do n't think Norris does either . We 're lost ! " That was in August . By the last of September we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the simple names of R-12 and R-14 . Each had crude forms of vegetable life , represented principally by the blue hensorr trees , but in neither case did the organic surveyor reveal the slightest traces of animal life . There was , however , a considerable difference in physical appearance between R-12 and R-14 , and for a time that fact excited Norris tremendously . Up to then , each successive planet , although similar in size , had exhibited signs of greater age than its predecessor . But on R-12 there were definite manifestations of younger geologic development . Several pieces of shale lay exposed under a fold of igneous rock . Two of those pieces contained fossils of highly developed ganoids , similar to those found on Venus . They were perfectly preserved . It meant that animal life had existed on R-12 , even if it did n't now . It meant that R-12 , though a much older planet than Earth , was still younger than Stragella or the rest . For a while Norris was almost beside himself . He cut out rock samples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervised the tuning of the surveyors . And when he finally gave orders to take off , he was almost friendly to Mason , whereas before his attitude toward him had been one of cold aloofness . But when we reached R-14 , our eighth landing , all that passed . For R-14 was old again , older than any of the others . And then , on October sixteenth , Mason opened the door of the locked cabin . It happened quite by accident . One of the arelium-thaxide conduits broke in the Marie Galante 's central passageway , and the resulting explosion grounded the central feed line of the instrument equipment . In a trice the passageway was a sheet of flame , rapidly filling with smoke from burning insulation . Norris , of course , was in the bridge cuddy with locked doors between us and him , and now with the wiring burned through there was no way of signalling him he was wanted for an emergency . In his absence Mason took command . That passageway ran the full length of the ship . Midway down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The explosion had jammed that door shut , and smoke was pouring forth from under the sill . All at once one of the women rushed forward to announce hysterically that Mason 's wife , Estelle , was in the lounge . Adjoining the lounge was a small cabin which since the beginning of our voyage had remained locked . Norris had given strict orders that that cabin was not to be disturbed . We all had taken it as a matter of course that it contained various kinds of precision instruments . Now , however , Mason realized that the only way into the lounge was by way of that locked cabin . If he used a heat blaster on the lounge door there was no telling what would happen to the woman inside . He ripped the emergency blaster from its wall mounting , pressed it to the magnetic latch of the sealed cabin door and pressed the stud . An instant later he was leading his frightened wife , Estelle , out through the smoke . The fire was quickly extinguished after that and the wiring spliced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Brandt and me aside . " We 've been wondering for a long time what happened to Ganeth-Klae , the Martian inventor who worked with Norris to invent Indurate , " he said very quietly . " Well , we do n't need to wonder any more . He 's in there . " Brandt and I stepped forward over the sill  --  and drew up short . Ganeth-Klae was there all right , but he would never trouble himself about making a voyage in a locked cabin . His rigid body was encased in a transparent block of amber-colored solidifex , the after-death preservative used by all Martians . Both of us recognized his still features at once , and in addition his name-tattoo , required by Martian law , was clearly visible on his left forearm. * * * * * For a brief instant the discovery stunned us . Klae dead ? Klae whose IQ had become a measuring guide for the entire system , whose Martian head held more ordinary horse sense , in addition to radical postulations on theoretical physics , than anyone on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the significance of his body on Norris ' ship ? Why had Norris kept its presence a secret and why had he given out the story of Klae 's disappearance ? Mason 's face was cold as ice . " Come with me , you two , " he said . " We 're going to get the answer to this right now . " We went along the passage to the circular staircase . We climbed the steps , passed through the scuttle and came to the door of the bridge cuddy . Mason drew the bar and we passed in . Norris was bent over the chart table . He looked up sharply at the sound of our steps . " What is the meaning of this intrusion ? " he said . It did n't take Mason long to explain . When he had finished , he stood there , jaw set , eyes smouldering . Norris paled . Then quickly he got control of himself , and his old bland smile returned . " I expected you to blunder into Klae 's body one of these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple . Klae had been ill for many months , and he knew his time was up . His one desire in life was to go on this expedition with me , and he made me promise to bury him at the site of our new colony . The pact was between him and me , and I 've followed it to the letter , telling no one . " Mason 's lips curled in a sneer . " And just what makes you think we 're going to believe that story ? " he demanded . Norris lit a cigar . " It 's entirely immaterial to me whether you believe it or not . " But the story was believed , especially by the women , to whom the romantic angle appealed and Mason 's embryonic mutiny died without being born , and the Marie Galante sailed on through uncharted space toward her ninth and last landing . As the days dragged by and no word came from the bridge cuddy , restlessness began to grow amongst us . Rumor succeeded rumor , each story wilder and more incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted to fever pitch , there came the sickening lurch and grinding vibration of another landing . Norris dispensed with his usual talk before marching out from the ship . After testing the atmosphere with the ozonometer , he passed out the heat pistols and distributed the various instruments for computing radioactivity and cosmic radiation . " This is the planet Nizar , " he said shortly . " Largest in the field of the sun Ponthis . You will make your survey as one group this time . I will remain here . " He stood watching us as we marched off down the cliff side . Then the blue hensorr trees rose up to swallow him from view . Mason swung along at the head of our column , eyes bright , a figure of aggressive action . We had gone but a hundred yards when it became apparent that , as a planet , Nizar was entirely different from its predecessors . There was considerable top soil , and here grew a tall reed-shaped plant that gave off varying chords of sound when the wind blew . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mighty church with a muted organ in the distance . There was animal life too , a strange lizard-like bird that rose up in flocks ahead of us and flew screaming overhead . " I do n't exactly like it , Bagley , " he said . " There 's something unwholesome about this planet . The evolution is obviously in an early state of development , but I get the impression that it has gone backward ; that the planet is really old and has reverted to its earlier life . " Above us the sky was heavily overcast , and a tenuous white mist rising up from the hensorr trees formed curious shapes and designs . In the distance I could hear the swashing of waves on a beach . Suddenly Mason stopped . " Look ! " he said . Below us stretched the shore of a great sea . But it was the structure rising up from that shore that drew a sharp exclamation from me . Shaped in a rough ellipse , yet mounted high toward a common point , was a large building of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crumbling ruins , the lower part studded with many bas-reliefs and triangular doorways . " Let 's go , " Mason said , breaking out into a fast loping run . The building was farther away than we had thought , but when we finally came up to it , we saw that it was even more of a ruin than it had at first appeared . It was only a shell with but two walls standing , alone and forlorn . Whatever race had lived here , they had come and gone . We prowled about the ruins for more than an hour . The carvings on the walls were in the form of geometric designs and cabalistic symbols , giving no clue to the city 's former occupants ' identity . And then Mason found the stairs leading to the lower crypts . He switched on his ato-flash and led the way down cautiously . Level one ... level two ... three ... we descended lower and lower . Here water from the nearby sea oozed in little rivulets that glittered in the light of the flash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of amphitheater , with tier on tier of seats surrounding it and extending back into the shadows . " Judging from what we 've seen , " Mason said , " I would say that the race that built this place had reached approximately a grade C-5 of civilization , according to the Mokart scale . This apparently was their council chamber . " " What are those rectangular stone blocks depending from the ceiling ? " I said . Mason turned the light beam upward . " I do n't know , " he said . " But my guess is that they are burial vaults . Perhaps the creatures were ornithoid . " Away from the flash the floor of the plaisance appeared to be a great mirror that caught our reflections and distorted them fantastically and horribly . We saw then that it was a form of living mold , composed of millions of tiny plants , each with an eye-like iris at its center . Those eyes seemed to be watching us , and as we strode forward , a great sigh rose up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small triangular dais in the center of the chamber , and in the middle of it stood an irregular black object . As we drew nearer , I saw that it had been carved roughly in the shape of this central building and that it was in a perfect state of preservation . Mason walked around this carving several times , examining it curiously . " Odd , " he said . " It looks to be an object of religious veneration , but I never heard before of a race worshipping a replica of their own living quarters . " Suddenly his voice died off . He bent closer to the black stone , studying it in the light of the powerful ato-flash . He got a small magnifying glass out of his pocket and focused it on one of the miniature bas-reliefs midway toward the top of the stone . Unfastening his geologic hammer from his belt , he managed , with a sharp , swinging blow , to break off a small protruding piece . He drew in his breath sharply , and I saw his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's wrong ? " I asked . He motioned that I follow and led the way silently past the others toward the stair shaft . Climbing to the top level was a heart-pounding task , but Mason almost ran up those steps . At the surface he leaned against a pillar , his lips quivering spasmodically . " Tell me I 'm sane , Bagley , " he said huskily . " Or rather , do n't say anything until we 've seen Norris . Come on . We 've got to see Norris . " * * * * * All the way back to the Marie Galante , I sought to soothe him , but he was a man possessed . He rushed up the ship 's gangway , burst into central quarters and drew up before Navigator Norris like a runner stopping at the tape . " You damned lying hypocrite ! " he yelled . Norris looked at him in his quiet way . " Take it easy , Mason , " he said . " Sit down and explain yourself . " But Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket , pulled out the piece of black stone he had chipped off the image in the cavern and handed it to Norris . " Take a look at that ! " he demanded . Norris took the stone , glanced at it and laid it down on his desk . His face was emotionless . " I expected this sooner or later , " he said . " Yes , it 's Indurate all right . Is that what you want me to say ? " There was a dangerous fanatical glint in Mason 's eyes now . With a sudden quick motion he pulled out his heat pistol . " So you tricked us ! " he snarled . " Why ? I want to know why . " I stepped forward and seized Mason 's gun hand . " Do n't be a fool , " I said . " It ca n't be that important . " Mason threw back his head and burst into an hysterical peal of laughter . " Important ! " he cried . " Tell him how important it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lighted his pipe . " I 'm afraid Mason is right , " he said . " I did trick you . Not purposely , however . And in the beginning I had no intention of telling anything but the truth . Actually we 're here because of a dead man 's vengeance . " Norris took his pipe from his lips and stared at it absently . " You 'll remember that Ganeth-Klae , the Martian , and I worked together to invent Indurate . But whereas I was interested in the commercial aspects of that product , Klae was absorbed only in the experimental angle of it . He had some crazy idea that it should not be given to the general public at once , but rather should be allocated for the first few years to a select group of scientific organizations . You see , Indurate was such a departure from all known materials that Ganeth-Klae feared it would be utilized for military purposes . " I took him for a dreamer and a fool . Actually he was neither . How was I to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get control of all commercial marketing of Indurate ? I had laid my plans carefully , and I had expected to reap a nice harvest . Klae must have been aware of my innermost thoughts , but Martian-like he said nothing . " Norris paused to wet his lips and lean against the desk . " I did n't kill Ganeth-Klae , " he continued , " though I suppose in a court of law I would be judged responsible for his death . The manufacture of Indurate required some ticklish work . As you know , we produced our halves of the formula separately . Physical contact with my half over a long period of time would prove fatal , I knew , and I simply neglected to so inform Ganeth-Klae . " But his ultimate death was a boomerang . With Klae gone , I could find no trace of his half of the formula . I was almost beside myself for a time . Then I thought of something . Klae had once said that the secret of his half of the formula lay in himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took the words at their face value and gambled that he meant them literally ; that is , that his body itself contained the formula . " I tried everything : X-ray , chemical analysis of the skin . I even removed the cranial cap and examined the brain microscopically . All without result . Meanwhile the police were beginning to direct their suspicions toward me in the matter of Klae 's disappearance . " You know the rest . It was necessary that I leave Earth at once and go beyond our system , beyond the jurisdiction of the planetary police . So I arranged this voyage with a sufficient complement of passengers to lessen the danger and hardship of a new life on a new world . I was still positive , however , that Klae 's secret lay in his dead body . I took that body along , encased in the Martian preservative , solidifex . " It was my idea that I could continue my examination once we were safe on a strange planet But I had reckoned without Ganeth-Klae . " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Klae was no fool . But I did n't know that with Martian stoicism he suspected the worst and took his own ironic means of combating it . He used the last lot of Indurate to make that booster , a device which he said would increase our take-off speed . He mounted it on the Marie Galante . " Mason , that device was no booster . It was a time machine , so devised as to catapult the ship not into outer space , but into the space-time continuum . It was a mechanism designed to throw the Marie Galante forward into the future . " A cloud of fear began to well over me . " What do you mean ? " I said again . Navigator Norris paced around his desk . " I mean that the Marie Galante has not once left Earth , has not in fact left the spot of its moorings but has merely gone forward in time . I mean that the nine ' landings ' we made were not stops on some other planets but halting stages of a journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head the effect could have been no greater . Cold perspiration began to ooze out on my forehead . In a flash I saw the significance of the entire situation . That was why Norris had been so insistent that we always return to the ship before dark . He did n't want us to see the night sky and the constellations there for fear we would guess the truth . That was why he had never permitted any of us in the bridge cuddy and why he had kept all ports and observation shields closed . " But the names of the planets ... Coulora , Stragella , and the others and their positions on the chart ... ? " I objected . Norris smiled grimly . " All words created out of my imagination . Like the rest of you , I knew nothing of the true action of the booster . It was only gradually that truth dawned on me . But by the time we had made our first ' landing ' I had guessed . That was why I demanded we always take organic surveyor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , far beyond the life period of man on Earth . But I was n't sure how far we had gone , and I lived with the hope that Klae 's booster might reverse itself and start carrying us backwards down the centuries . " For a long time I stood there in silence , a thousand mad speculations racing through my mind . " How about that piece of Indurate ? " I said at length . " It was chipped off an image in the ruins of a great building a mile or so from here . " " An image ? " repeated Norris . A faint glow of interest slowly rose in his eyes . Then it died . " I do n't know , " he said . " It would seem to presuppose that the formula , both parts of it , was known by Klae and that he left it for posterity to discover . " All this time Mason had been standing there , eyes smouldering , lips an ugly line . Now abruptly he took a step forward . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . He doubled back his arm and brought his fist smashing onto Norris ' jaw . The Navigator 's head snapped backward ; he gave a low groan and slumped to the floor . And that is where , by all logic , this tale should end . But , as you may have guessed , there is an anticlimax  --  what story-tellers call a happy conclusion . Mason , Brandt , and I worked , and worked alone , on the theory that the secret of the Indurate formula would be the answer to our return down the time trail . We removed the body of Ganeth-Klae from its solidifex envelope and treated it with every chemical process we knew . By sheer luck the fortieth trial worked . A paste of carbo-genethon mixed with the crushed seeds of the Martian iron-flower was spread over Klae 's chest and abdomen . And there , in easily decipherable code , was not only the formula , but the working principles of the ship 's booster  --  or rather , time-catapult . After that , it was a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time stream . We are heading back as I write these lines . If they reach print and you read them , it will mean our escape was successful and that we returned to our proper slot in the epilogue of human events . There remains , however , one matter to trouble me . Navigator Norris . I like the man . I like him tremendously , in spite of his cold-blooded confession , and past record . He must be punished , of course . But I , for one , would hate to see him given the death penalty . It is a serious problem .
