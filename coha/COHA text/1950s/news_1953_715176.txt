txt The Legislature 's top Republican fiscal officers today threw virtually all offiMayor Impellitteri 's 1953 financial program on to the scrap heap and told the - Mayor he would have to offer something better . Senator Walter J. Mahoney , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , and Assemblyman William H. , chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee , declared that the Impellitteri proposals fell " far short " of a " sound , long-range . fiscal program . " In a joint statement , they attacked the Mayor 's request for 5218,700,000 in new revenue and state aid as a bundle of " fiscal gimmicks " and " a grab bag of tax proposals " that would penalize already burdened taxpayers and tend to drive business out of the state . Their opposition appeared to seal the death warrant for Mr. Impelprogram in anything resembiing its present form . Senator Mahoney and Mr. are the official financial spokesmen for the Dewey Administration in the Legislature and it was understood that their views accurately reflected those of the Governor .. " The city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may even represent a serious threat to the.economic Well-being of the entire state ? and more especially to that of the city itself , the leaders declared . Threat to Business in State They raised basic objections to six of the Impellitteri proposals . Four of these , if approved by the Legislature , would contribute about 5147,700,000 of the 5218,700,000 new revenues that the Mayor is seeking for 1953-54. . - Their heaviest criticism . fell on the suggestion that businesses. - in the City be taxed to meet 20 per cent of the cost of running the transit system under a new authority . The statement called this " one of the most ill conceived of the grab bag revenue proposals " and predicted that it would be " the last straw " for many business men now on the verge of transferring their activities to states where the tax laws are more liberal . The legislators warned that the transit business tax would force many businesses and . industries outside Of the city to contribute " regularly and heavily toward the support of New York City 's bankrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because many corporations maintain offices in the city while having plants and conducting much of their business upstate . Under the Impellitteri plan , it was said , such businesses would pay , a transit tax based on their entire business over the state . " The proposal violates the principles of sound taxation , and is in direct opposition to the long sustained efforts of the state to attract new business and to encourage expansion here of existing firms , " the fiscal leaders said . " It could only result in untold harm to the economic life of the state : Other Impellitteri requests criticized by Senator Mahoney and Mr. were : cSeeking $62,700,000 in additional state aid to the city . They said this would " dictate the necessity " of increased state tax rates or new state taxes . cAdvancing the date of a $40 , - 000,000 state aid payment due the city in July to increase the number of payments in the 1953-54 fiscal year only . The leaders called this " just another temporary expedient to postpone the day of reckoning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The legislators predicted that this could be " a staggering blow " to retail gasoline trade in the city and might ruin many small business men . CRaising , $25,000,000 in new revenue through a city tax on stock transfers . The leaders said this would " inevitably . . . chase business right out of the state " and thus eventually prove costly to all taxpayers . cRaising an additional $20,000 ? - 000 a year by including real estate transactions in purchases coming under the city 's 2 per cent sales tax . This would discourage many city residents desiring to buy homes , the legislators said . Lieut . Gov . Frank C. Moore , who has been conducting a series of meetings with city officials in an effort to work out a long-range financial program , said today that he had not seen the MahoneyMackenzie statement prior to its release . Mr. Moore reported that he planned to make public his opinion of Mayor Impellitteri 's plan some time during the next week after his staff had given him an analysis of the city 's requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be similar " to those of the legislators or " might vary . " In response to a question , he said he knew of no further meetings scheduled between state and ity officials on city financial problems . Depletion of State Revenue One of the principal objections to the Impellitteri program raised by Senator Mahoney and Assemblyman involved the fact that most of the new taxes requested by the city would be deductible from income on which state taxes are paid . " The effect of these taxes thus would be to cause a shrinkage of the state tax base and a consequent loss of state tax revenue ? and this at the very time that the city asks that state aid be boosted by $62,700,000 , " they said . The leaders also declared that " one of the most disturbing aspects of the city 's program is that it affords little promise of more economical or efficient administration of the city 's sprawling government . " Despite their dissatisfaction with the present proposals tile legislators ' promised that " the Republican majority in the - Legislature shall continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations which are in harmony with the fiscal objectives of the state as a whole . " They echoed Governor Dewey 's message to the Legislature last Wednesday in declaring that the responsibility for an acceptable plan lay squarely , with the city officials . " A constructive approach to this responsibility , divorced from policies based on politics and postponement , is long overdue , " they observed . The Mahoney-qzmacq#Kenzie statement made no mention of Mayor Impellitteri 's request that the Legislature pass for the second time the proposed constitutional amendment raising the city 's tax ? limit from 2 to ay . per cent of the assessed value of real estate . If approved by the Legislature this year and by the voters at next fall 's election , this measure would provide , the city with about $49 , - 000,000 more b durine- the 1953-54 fiscal year and about $100,000,000 a year thereafter . Today 's response from the Leg- , islative leaders came only five days after the Mayor 's program had been submitted in Albany . In his message Wednesday , Mr. Dewey said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four hours . " The Governor also said in his message that the city was receiving a fair share of as it was and indicated strongly that Mayor Impellitteri 's request for $63,700,000 in increased state aid would fall on deaf ears . Today 's action by the Legislature 's fiscal officers , who would be extremely unlikely to take such a step without the Governor 's approval , effectively tossed back in the Mayor 's lap the issue that seems sure to be one of the hottest of the 1953 session . Mayor Awaits Study Report Mayor Impellitteri - declared last night : " I can not believe that this statement , issued after what must have been a very cursory examination of our program , can represent the thinking of the State Administration . " Governor Dewey in his message to the Legislature and Lieut . Gov . Frank C. Moore in a letter received by me last Thursday both stated that the city 's fiscal program would receive intensive analysis and careful consideration . " The program is still under study and when that study is completed a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . " There was a possibility that further comment on the joint statement of the Republican leaders ) would be forthcoming after the Mayor confers today at Gracie Mansion with Senator Francis J. Mahoney of Manhattan and Assemblyman Eugene F. Bannigan of Brooklyn , the leaders of the Democratic minority in Albany . The conference will deal with the Mayor 's program of fiscal legislation in aid of the city 's 1953-54 budget .
