Alone among Ohio political editors , the Youngstown Vindicator 's lisping , kewpie-faced Clingan Jackson , 50 , has already picked his favorite in the seven-way race to win the Democratic nomination for governor in May . Jackson 's choice : Clingan Jackson . His selection was no surprise to readers of the Vindicator ( circ. 99,930 ) , who have watched Jackson juggle a dizzying succession of hats since 1936 , when he became the paper 's political writer while serving as a state legislator . <P> During his long coverage of politics , Jackson has been a candidate for office in seven primary and four general elections ( and lost only three primaries ) , served six years each as a state senator and a Democratic central committeeman . He has bagged appointive plums ranging from chairmanship of Ohio 's Highway Construction Council ( at $50 a day ) to membership on the Strip Mine Commission . While drawing $8,000 a year from his Vindicator job , nimble Newsman Jackson since last May has helped make ends meet by working four days a week as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " Never , " brags Jackson , " have I violated confidences or tried to scoop fellow reporters by virtue of knowing something as a legislator that they might not know as newsmen . " But it is fellow newsmen who have now brought Jackson 's hat tricks under fire . John S. Knight 's Akron Beacon Journal ( circ. 161,624 ) lectured him on ethics in an editorial headed <P> CLINGAN JACKSON SHOULD QUIT . Last week <P> Jackson roused the angry voice of Editor Louis B. Seltzer of Scripps-Howard 's Cleveland Press ( circ. 313,749 ) . Under the headline THESE THINGS DO N'T MIX , the Press urged that Jackson either drop out of the governor 's race or 1 ) quit as political editor and 2 ) resign from the parole board , on which " the chance to make some extra friends by being extra lenient is just too appealing to pass up . " Added the Press : " Trying to make himself look good ( as a candidate ) when he knows ( as a reporter ) he ca n't win , Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> <P> Striking back at politically powerful Editor Seltzer in a speech that was dutifully covered by another Vindicator staffer , Candidate Jackson puffed : " The public need not beware of newspapermen who are out in the open as candidates . Citizens can deal with them directly . How much worse it is for a press overlord to attempt to govern by pulling strings but taking none of the responsibility or the blame ! " Added 74-year-old Frederick Maag Jr. , publisher of the Democratic Vindicator : " Mr. Jackson is so well-equipped for public service that it would be a shame to deprive him of the right to take part in politics . Of course , I 'm not sure what our position might be if Jackson were nominated and became the Democratic candidate for governor . " That prospect , less interested political editors agreed , is even more remote than the chance that Clingan Jackson will quit writing about politics .
