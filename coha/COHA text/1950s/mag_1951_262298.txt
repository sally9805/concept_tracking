Before dawn one day last week , a hunting party of five men sloshed through the rain-soaked woods of Yarmouth County , Nova Scotia with their two Little River duck dogs , Dusty and Tootsie . At the rocky shore of Lake Mestock the party divided , settled down to wait in their spruce and fern blinds on opposite sides of the lake . They did n't have to wait long . Just after 8 o'clock a flock of nearly 200 ducks circled over the lake and landed on the water some 1,000 yards off the west shore . <P> Caught by the Tail . One of the hunters promptly tossed a small stick into the water . Dusty 's bright , bushy tail flapped wildly as he raced to retrieve it . But before he could pick it up , the hunters had thrown another . For five minutes they kept the dog racing into the water and out , dashing back &; forth along the rocks , " tolling " * the ducks . Soon the inquisitive birds began to swim inshore , attracted by Dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dusty led the ducks around in a slow turn , brought them back past the hunters , only a few feet from the shoreline . Then one of the men shouted to Dusty . The dog raced ashore . The startled ducks took flight and the hunters blazed away . Dusty splashed back into the lake to retrieve eight birds , while the rest of the flock flapped across the lake toward the blind where Tootsie was waiting with the other hunters . <P> There the process was repeated . Before they went home the hunters bagged 14 birds-a fair day . " If the sun had been brighter , " explained one of the men , " the ducks would have caught a better reflection from the dogs ' tails . But with dogs like these you can toll ducks any day of the week , rain or shine . " <P> Bred to Order . Listed today by the Canadian Kennel Club as thoroughbreds , Little River duck dogs like Dusty and Tootsie were a mongrel breed at the turn of the century . They were bred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hunters had watched flashing his tail to lure ducks ashore for his morning breakfast . The cross-breeding that first took place in the Little River district of Yarmouth County included collies ( for their luxuriant tails ) , Chesapeake Bay retrievers ( for their abilities on the hunt ) and spitz ( for their playful habit of chasing sticks all day ) . Somewhere along the line an Irish setter got into the act , donating his bright ruddy color . <P> Even before the official recognition of the Canadian Kennel Club , the Little River dogs had developed into essentially a " pure " breed . They had been mated only with their own type for generations . Now the standard Nova Scotia tolling dogs are about 18 inches high , have thick , high-riding tails , and are the color of a red fox . Beneath their silky coat is an undercoat that makes their fur almost water-repellent . Brought up in most cases among the domesticated ducks of Yarmouth County 's farms , they seldom lose control while tolling . They never bark before a shot is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
