Through as stormy a career as ever rocked , shocked and shook up big league baseball and Thoroughbred horse racing , Leland Stanford ( Larry ) MacPhail has gone bulldozing along , confounding his critics , justifying the faith of his friends with comeback after comeback , time and again turning apparent failure into success , seeming disaster into triumph . // Nothing fazes MacPhail . When he was a big-time football referee , bitterly partisan crowds more than once swarmed over the field to get at him . He stared them down . He took two world wars in his stride , as a captain in one , a colonel in the other . He flourished in good times and bad : with night baseball he showed club owners how to increase attendance at the bottom of a depression . // He has thrived on public criticism . He has been unchastened by what most men would consider public embarrassment . One time , when he was running the Cincinnati ball club , he got in a fight with a police sergeant in the elevator of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page One . Thomas Conroy , banker and director of the Cincinnati club , rushed to MacPhail 's home where he expected to find him remorseful and penitent . Instead , Conroy said recently , he found MacPhail , showing the marks of battle , one eye swollen shut , chortling over the newspapers . His first words to Conroy were : " Man , how do you like that for publicity ! " // MacPhail has weathered some very bad breaks and has been unchanged by some extraordinarily good ones . The comforts that fortune has sent his way  --  like the $2 million he made out of the New York Yankees , the 1,000-acre horse and cattle farm , the Jaguar , the Chrysler , the station wagons and the boat that awaits his pleasure in Florida in the wintertime and on Chesapeake Bay in the summer  --  MacPhail accepts as no more than proper rewards for hard work and enterprise . // Nothing fazes MacPhail , but certain old controversies ( which I have been dredging up in our continuing conversations ) scarcely had a tranquilizing effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last . // The Jean KM , a 58-foot diesel-powered Burger cruiser , backed away from the Georgetown , Maryland yacht basin and pointed down the Sassafras River for a weekend cruise on Chesapeake Bay . // Seated in deck chairs were the MacPhails : Larry , his wife Jean and their 8-year-old daughter , Jeanie Katherine MacMurtrie MacPhail , for whom the boat was named . // After a while Jeanie went forward and in a moment she could be heard , faintly , practicing on her toy flute , a project that had been occupying her for a week or more . // MacPhail , hearing the flute , gestured in a pretense of anguish . " Oh , no , " he groaned , " she did n't bring that flute ? " // " She said she absolutely needed more practice , " smiled Mrs. MacPhail . There was to be a toy flute chorus at the public school Jeanie attends in Bel Air , Md. , a single performance of a work entitled , Shoo , Fly , Do n't Bother Me. // MacPhail grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skipper at the wheel , studying the charts . He asked the captain if he was quite clear about where they wanted to go : the Great Oak Yacht Club on Fairlee Creek , another tributary of Chesapeake Bay . The captain said he knew exactly where it was . // MacPhail came back down to the deck and I stood beside him at the rail . Mrs. MacPhail sat reading a paperback book entitled A Family Affair . MacPhail pointed out some of the estates along the Sassafras and mentioned that there were 5,000 miles of waterways in the Chesapeake Bay area which , he said , unfortunately became almost intolerable with heat and humidity in July and August . Then the MacPhails usually took the boat farther north , up the Hudson perhaps or ( as they did this summer ) through the St. Lawrence Seaway to the Great Lakes . In the winter they live on the Jean KM for two or three months in Florida . // MacPhail turned away from the rail and I followed him below to the main cabin where he started looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's high-fidelity system . He asked me if there was anything I wanted to hear and I said he probably did n't have The Battle Hymn of the Republic as done by Fred Waring and his chorus . // " Got it right here , " said MacPhail , consulting his index and adding the record to those on the player . // We settled down to talk , with the music softly in the background . I drew my notebook from my pocket and laid it beside me on the sofa , flipping over a few pages . MacPhail , seated across the cabin , looked at the notebook quizzically . It was not a notebook I was taking notes in . It was already filled with notes I had made before coming to see MacPhail for the first time , at his Maryland farm , about two weeks before . The notes included statements , highly critical of MacPhail in some cases , lavishly praising him in other cases , reporting things he had done in the heat of anger , like fighting policemen , newspapermen , baseball associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during my talks with MacPhail , I had quoted from the notebook . He had confirmed some things and denied others with vehemence . I still had n't brought up the touchiest subject of all : MacPhail 's long , running feud with Branch Rickey , the most celebrated personality conflict in baseball . As far as I could find out , the two men were still as far apart as their favorite drinks : MacPhail 's brandy and soda , Rickey 's root beer and milk . // It was a subject to be approached , I felt , with care . I was glad MacPhail had turned on the hi-fi . It gave me a chance to start with a noninflammable topic : his interest in music . // " Yes , " said MacPhail , relaxing and taking his eyes off the notebook . " I 've always loved the opera and symphonic music . I guess I 've heard every great symphony orchestra in the United States and Europe . Mrs. MacPhail and I made a trip to Paris especially to hear the Vienna Symphony play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " Do you have any favorite composer ? " I asked . // MacPhail looked at me rather sharply . // " I do n't think , " he said , " you have a favorite composer . Maybe you have favorite symphonies . " // " I guess that 's what I meant . " // " Oh , hell , " said MacPhail , " I guess in the beginning I 'd have said my favorite composer was Tchaikovsky . But now I 'd say I also like Sibelius , Richard Strauss , Brahms , Dvorak . I have favorite conductors . I like Ormandy . I like Bernstein very much . I 've always taken great satisfaction in the fact that when Leonard Bernstein played for the first time in Carnegie Hall I made the prediction that this young man would one day be the permanent conductor of the New York Philharmonic and , of course , that 's exactly what happened . " // " You sponsored a program of symphonic music on the radio when you were president of the Yankees . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I was president of the Dodgers , Russell Bennett composed a symphony , Symphony in D he called it , and dedicated it to the Dodgers and to me . It had our radio announcer , Red Barber , as the narrator . It was performed for the first time by the Philharmonic during the summer concerts at Lewisohn Stadium in New York . At the conclusion the composer and the conductor took their bows and then I was called up to acknowledge the dedication . I made a little talk to the capacity crowd there in the stadium , but I had a little difficulty making myself heard . The orchestra kept booing me . They were Giant fans . " // MacPhail chuckled and got up and went into the galley to fix some drinks . While he was gone , I flipped a few pages of my notebook to a section I had marked " Rickey vs . MacPhail. " // In a moment MacPhail came out of the galley and put down some drinks on the table and took one up to Mrs. MacPhail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Next season , I hope to get out and hear some good music . I 'm getting pretty tired of hearing MacPhail at the organ . " He was referring to his habit of playing the organ in his living room back at Glenangus Farm . // The music came softly from the speakers at either end of the cabin . MacPhail relaxed , drumming his fingers in time with the music . // I picked up my notebook and leaned forward . // " I would like now , " I said , " to speak of your great benefactor in baseball , Mr. Branch Rickey. " // MacPhail 's mouth dropped open . " My great what ? " // I glanced at my notes . " Benefactor , " I said . " An entry I have here says , ' MacPhail 's great benefactor , responsible for MacPhail 's success in baseball , ' and so on and so forth . ' Put MacPhail in as president of Columbus club , recommended him for Cincinnati and Brooklyn jobs . ' Etcetera , etcetera . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . He hitched up his trousers . He took a final sip from his glass and set it down carefully . // The record player had played its way down to my record , The Battle Hymn of the Republic . The chorus sang , " Mine eyes have seen the glory .... " I looked up at MacPhail , then back at my notebook . It was too late to turn back now . I quoted another excerpt : " When MacPhail was desperately seeking a new manager at Brooklyn , he called Rickey and pleaded for advice from his old benefactor . ' Why , Larry , ' said Rickey , ' you have a man on the club right now who has fine potential as a manager . ' ' Who is it , Branch ? ' cried MacPhail . Rickey replied , ' Leo Durocher. ' " // A sound erupted from MacPhail that was a cross between the bellow of a lovesick bull and the blast of a diesel locomotive 's horn . It rose over Fred Waring 's shouting chorus and reduced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacPhail 's toy flute . // The sound trailed off and I leaped into the lull . " Of course , " I said , " that 's only one version . Another version says it was John McDonald , your traveling secretary at Brooklyn , who suggested Durocher although you never gave him credit . " // This last had a sudden calming effect on MacPhail , like a second blow from a sledge hammer . He sank down on the sofa , picked up his empty glass and looked into it . // The Fred Waring chorus concluded rousingly with " Glory , glory , hallelujah , His truth goes marching on ! " It was the last record on the player . // MacPhail again arose with deliberation . He straightened his shoulders and flung his arms as though he intended to throw away his hands . He spoke , as to a judge on the bench , lapsing perhaps into the role of the trial lawyer he was in his youth . // " Let the record show , " he said with great restraint , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this conversation . Furthermore , let it be noted that I have never , at any time , gratuitously attacked Mr. Rickey except where it was necessary for me to correct or answer statements or charges by him against me. " // I nodded . // Now , then , " said MacPhail , walking over to where I was seated . I braced myself , for I had learned during our conferences that MacPhail , in the friendliest of fashions , is given to pushing , jabbing , pummeling and shaking the listener , only for the purpose of emphasizing a point . ( It had occurred to me in this connection that the chief operator of the Bel Air telephone exchange who had charged that MacPhail " pushed " her in an argument over a telephone call might have mistaken the gesture as being of an antagonistic nature  --  which , in the case of MacPhail , does not follow at all . Of course , in the telephone case , MacPhail 's position was weakened by the charge of the manager of the telephone exchange , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm of his hand . This latter charge no doubt influenced the arresting officers as well as the judge , who fined MacPhail $50 and costs. ) // " Now , then , " said MacPhail , " Branch Rickey never did a damn thing for me except to fire me at Columbus . " // " Why did he fire you ? " // " Because I would n't resign without Rickey spelling out the exact charges against me. " // " Did you have any idea of what the charges might be ? " // " I asked for a statement of the charges against me . Mr. Rickey has n't made that statement yet . // " Now what happened was that after I had left , the Columbus club was accused of having violated the $400-a-month-salary limit and had paid several players an additional amount under the table , so to speak . " // " You did n't make any such under-the-table deals ? " // " I did not ! " cried MacPhail . " I was n't with the club any more when those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Association of violating the salary limit . In other words , Columbus was convicted of cheating . Columbus appealed this decision to Judge Bramham , the president of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues , but Judge Bramham upheld the conviction . He also added that he had not commented on anything I might have had to do with it since I was no longer in baseball . // " Now , I wanted this thing to be absolutely clear . I called Judge Landis . He was in Galveston , Texas at the time . I asked him for a full hearing , and he called in all the players involved and investigated the entire matter . When the hearing was over he issued a statement saying that I had had nothing to do with signing those players . In other words , it was proved to the satisfaction of Judge Landis that I had not cheated . " // I looked at my notes . // " But it was Rickey who put you in as president of the Columbus club ? " // MacPhail stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded , " could he put me in as president when I was already president ? I organized the syndicate that bought the club from Sidney Weil of Cincinnati . When , as club president , I sold the club to the Cardinals , I agreed to remain as president at the request of Sam Breadon of the Cardinals . " He thought briefly and added : " One of the finest men I have ever known , a man I respected and loved until the day he died . " // I consulted my notebook . " I have a note here , source confidential , that you irritated Rickey by your manner of running the ball club at Columbus . You did too much entertaining , you gave yourself an office that was better than any office in the big league . " // MacPhail laughed . // " Hah , " he exclaimed , " that office . What happened there was that the contractor was able to beat the estimate and get a bonus of $50,000 . He came to me and said he 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I had been of help to him . So he went ahead and paneled my office in walnut or something at a cost to him of $5,000 . Just about that time , I saw that a local store was having a sale of some Oriental rugs damaged in a fire . I went down and bought some for next to nothing . Some time after that I was in St. Louis and Mr. Sam Breadon called me into his " office . He said , ' MacPhail , look around this office here . Do you see any wood paneling on the walls or any Oriental rugs on the floor ? ' I said , ' I know what you 're talking about , Mr. Breadon . You 're talking about my office at Columbus . I want to ask you would you take wood paneling if you could get it for nothing , would you take Oriental rugs if you could get them at a fire sale for the price of the linoleum you 've got on your floor here ? ' Breadon said he guessed he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was easy to guess who had been carrying tales . " // " Rickey ? " // " No comment , " said MacPhail. // " Colonel MacPhail , " I said , " so now we have you out of baseball . You go from Columbus back to join your father and brother in the banking and investment business in Grand Rapids , Mich . Then the Central Trust Company of Cincinnati is forced to foreclose on Mr. Sidney Weil , the owner of the Cincinnati Reds . The bank finds itself in the baseball business and desperately needs an experienced baseball man to take over . Feelers are put out to Branch Rickey to see if he is interested . He is not but he recommends you and you get the job . " // " Nothing of the kind , " roared MacPhail . " Rickey had nothing to do with it . I was hired by the board of directors and approved as a member of the National League by a unanimous vote , with Mr. Breadon of St. Louis casting the first vote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone by Mr. John Heydler , president of the National League , and asked if there would be any objection to me for any reason whatsoever . Judge Landis replied that he considered Mr. MacPhail capable of filling any job with any major league ball club from bat boy to president ! " // I held up my notebook . " I read now from the minutes of that National League meeting which voted on your acceptance as a league member . Mr. Rickey is asked , with special reference to your tenure at Columbus , to make a statement about your qualifications for the Cincinnati thing , to say if there is any reason why you should not have it . Mr. Rickey says , in part , and I quote : ' My opinion is that Mr. MacPhail is a man who will benefit the league in Cincinnati tremendously . Now , whether that answers your question or not , I do not know , but I am ready to make that statement very forcibly  --  apart from minor criticisms , to which we are all subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am referring to little things . It might be that he would be too trusting . For example , to put a concrete case before you , Larry MacPhail would be very trusting , let us say , to a friend of his , a newspaperman , John Jones , and he has him out to dinner tonight , and he casually observes a certain thing , makes a certain observation about something he proposes to do , let us say . He tells him that in confidence , as a statement in confidence , to be respected as such . From the standpoint of your own practical experience in baseball , that would have been a subject that MacPhail perhaps should not have told that man , but he did it , trustingly , and then the first thing he knows , something comes out of nowhere . I have known other baseball men in their early days to make the same mistake , if you can call it a mistake . ' " // I looked up at MacPhail . " What was Mr. Rickey driving at there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell do I know ? You tell me . " I stood up . MacPhail pushed me and I sat down . " Go listen to some of Casey Stengel 's doubletalk and ask him what he 's driving at . " // MacPhail peered out the porthole . " Where the devil are we ? I 'd better go take a look at the chart . I think we 've passed Fairlee Creek . " // He went up to the bridge . // I picked up my notebook . I pondered the case of Rickey vs . MacPhail . The key to the long-standing feud between these two giants ( who had done more to change the face of baseball than any other two men or two hundred men ever connected with the game ) was not to be found , it seemed to me , in the resolving of such basically simple questions as to whether Rickey helped MacPhail get his jobs at Cincinnati and Brooklyn . As a matter of fact , I had checked on that . Conroy , the Cincinnati banker , a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that Rickey did indeed recommend MacPhail for the job with the Reds . On the other hand , James Mulvey , director of the Brooklyn Dodgers , had told me that it was Ford Frick , not Rickey , who recommended MacPhail at Brooklyn . // The record was further complicated by the fact that Rickey and MacPhail had more or less cordial dealings in player trades when MacPhail was at Cincinnati and Brooklyn . MacPhail hired Rickey 's son , Branch Jr. , to help run the Brooklyn farm system . Did Rickey tell MacPhail to make Leo Durocher manager of the Dodgers in 1939 or was it John McDonald , the traveling secretary , who claimed credit for the idea ? Again , James Mulvey supported MacPhail . " Larry , " he said , " knew all about Durocher 's potential as a manager . He did n't need Rickey 's advice on that and he certainly was n't depending on his traveling secretary for counsel about anything so vital . " // There were two incidents , either of which might have been enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of repair . // One arose out of the charge by Leo Durocher , then Brooklyn manager under Rickey , that MacPhail was entertaining gamblers in his box at Havana during spring training . When the charge was called to Rickey 's attention , he deplored MacPhail 's alleged consorting with gamblers . MacPhail demanded a hearing by Baseball Commissioner A. B. ( Happy ) Chandler and proved to the commissioner 's satisfaction that Duro-cher 's charge was groundless . As an aftermath of this hearing , Durocher was suspended for a year on an accumulation of other counts . // The second significant incident came when MacPhail was chairman of an interleague policy committee charged with working out a method for bringing Negro players into organized baseball . Before the committee could report , Rickey signed Jackie Robinson and , in MacPhail 's view , undercut the work of the committee . Later , Rickey was quoted as saying in a speech at a Negro college that the major league clubs ( with the exception of the Brooklyn Dodgers ) had no intention of ever permitting Negroes to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged that Rickey was crediting himself with lofty motives for bringing about situations that were to his own advantage . To Rickey 's professed anguish over Durocher 's suspension , MacPhail replied that he wanted to get rid of Durocher anyway and did n't have the courage to fire him . To Rickey 's claim that his signing of Jackie Robinson was prompted by a conscientious desire to correct an injustice , MacPhail issued a blistering bill of particulars , distributed by the Associated Press , concluding with : // " Rickey was not interested in doing something constructive for either baseball or the Negro players . In spite of the fact that he accepted an appointment by the major leagues to study this problem and report his findings , he doublecrossed his associates for his own personal advantage , raided the Negro leagues and took players without adequately compensating them for players he took . Rickey was not kidding anybody in baseball with all that bunk about his conscience ... Churchill must have had Rickey in mind when he said of Sir Stafford Cripps , ' There , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The boat was turning . MacPhail must have been right : we had gone past Fairlee Creek . As we swung around , a mournful sound came from up on deck . It was Jeanie MacPhail playing her toy flute , still struggling to master Shoo , Fly , against the fast approaching deadline . She did n't quite have it yet . // We had dinner at the Great Oak Yacht Club and afterward , walking around the grounds , I asked MacPhail , " You said you were fired at Columbus , and you quit Brooklyn to go in the Army . But why did you leave Cincinnati just when you seemed to be getting a pennant-winning team together ? " // MacPhail said : " There were a number of reasons . Health was one of them . I had developed a nervous facial tic and the doctor said I had to slow down . Then , my father was getting on , and he and my brother Herman needed help in running the investment company back in Michigan in which I was a partner . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eye with Mr. Powel Crosley Jr . on some things . I had gotten him interested in buying $150,000 worth of preferred stock in the club and I had turned over to him options I had on the common stock . It was understood that I would be allowed to buy one-third of the stock when I could finance the purchase . So far , although ' Mr. Crosley had exercised options on part of the common stock , he would not permit me to exercise my end of the agreement . " // MacPhail kicked at a pebble , hands thrust in his trouser pockets . // " Then there were a few other things . Mr. Crosley and I get along fine today , but in those old days I did n't like some of the things Mr. Crosley had done  --  like putting up a big refrigerator and a radio , products he manufactured , on the scoreboard . He had insisted on changing the name of the ball park to Crosley Field . I did n't think he had contributed anything to baseball up to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were a lot of little things . He wanted me to fire Scotty Reston as club publicity man because Scotty was supposed to have made some disrespectful remarks about him at a country club bar . I would n't do it . ( Scotty Reston is James B. Reston , present chief of The New York Times Washington Bureau . Anyway , I told Ford Frick in August of that year that I would n't be back at Cincinnati the following season . " // The MacPhails strolled on and I went back to the boat with Jeanie . We sat on the deck and Jeanie picked up a book . " Would you like to hear me read ? " she said . I nodded . // Jeanie opened her book and began : // " One day as a little old woman was sweeping her house she found a crooked sixpence . ' What shall I do with this sixpence ? ' she thought as she polished it . I know , I will go to the market and buy a pig . ' So she did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a stile , and the pig refused to go over the stile . The little old woman went on until she met a spotted dog . She said to the dog , ' Dog , dog , bite pig , piggy wo n't get over the stile and I sha n't get home tonight . ' " // Jeanie looked up . " This is one of my absolute favorites. " // " Mine , too , " I said . // As she read on , I closed my eyes and thought about MacPhail and Rickey . It seemed to me that there was perhaps a good deal to be said on both sides . Allowances had to be made . Rickey 's friends make allowances for his sometimes high-sounding declarations of his motives for doing what he does ; MacPhail 's friends are similarly generous in excusing his outbursts of temper . " Under certain circumstances , " a MacPhail admirer had told me , " Larry is likely to take a poke at his best friend . But he 'll be sorry and do everything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grudge , he 's generous , he 's honest as the day is long . For all his huffing and puffing , he 's soft-hearted . He would n't tell a lie . He would n't do a cruel thing deliberately . " // I heard Jeanie say , " Are you listening ? " // " Oh , yes , " I said , sitting up straight in my chair . " It 's getting exciting . " // " Ox , ox , " continued Jeanie , " drink water , water wo n't quench fire , fire wo n't burn stick , stick wo n't beat dog , dog wo n't bite pig , piggy wo n't get over the stile , and I sha n't get home tonight . " // I drifted off again . Mr. Rickey , I thought , could not be the hypocritical person his worst enemies have held him to be ; he could n't and live with himself . He must believe  --  or believe he believes  --  in what he professes to believe . Even if he ( like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must have been completely convinced that he was right . No man could live a whole lifetime of pretense . If Rickey and MacPhail were pitted against each other in a courtroom ( an appropriate setting since both are lawyers ) , each could summon a long list of character witnesses . The more I thought about the courtroom scene , the more fitting it seemed . I had a vague feeling that there had been such a scene  --  and there had been . It was the famous monkey trial in Tennessee when an irreverent MacPhaillike Clarence Darrow was matched against a Bible-quoting Rickeylike William Jennings Bryan . // MacPhail is something like Dar-row , but his irreverence does not mean that he is irreligious . Like Darrow , he is brilliant , but principally because he makes certain he knows what he is talking about . // MacPhail is what Walter Mitty dreamed of being : the man who could do anything , tell off the boss to his face , put over the big deal , take a punch at the cop , say the things at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day . // At any rate , despite the wide gulf that separated them in temperament and character , Leland Stanford MacPhail and Branch Wesley Rickey had been good for baseball and baseball had been good to them . Out of the game played with bat and ball both had become millionaires and squires of great estates . // I came to just in time to hear Jeanie MacPhail concluding her reading : // " The cat began to kill the rat , the rat began to gnaw the rope , the rope began to hang the butcher , the butcher began to kill the ox , the ox began to drink the water , the water began to quench the fire , the fire began to burn the stick , the stick began to beat the dog , the dog began to bite the pig , the pig jumped over the stile and so the little old woman did get home that night after all . " // Jeanie was a little breathless . " Was n't that good ? " she asked . // " That was wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like life , is n't it ? " // At least , it was like life in the wonderful and absurd world of baseball , I thought . As Jeanie looked for another selection , a paraphrase suggested itself : " MacPhail began to beat the cop , the cop began to tell the judge , the judge began to set the fine , Rickey began to get the job , MacPhail began to blow his top , Chandler began to fire the Lip , the Lip began .... " It was not too outrageous a summation , actually , of what I had copied into my notebook over the past weeks . And there it had been all the time in Jeanie MacPhail 's book of nursery rhymes . // One morning , a few days after the Chesapeake Bay cruise , MacPhail was at his desk bright and early in the library of the main house at Glenangus Farm . He wore a sport jacket and an open sport shirt ; his red hair was slicked back and he was bright-eyed and tanned from the weekend on the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a few theoretical miles on his Exercycle before taking the whirlpool bath that he finds beneficial in relieving some arthritic twinges in his hip . Creola , the maid , had brought him half a grapefruit and some black coffee and now he was squared away for the day 's activities , dictating memos to a recording machine , talking on the phone to another Maryland horse farm , making arrangements to send over one of the brood mares for breeding . A call came from a glass company . It concluded a winter 's hassle about the quality of the glass in the living room picture window . The glass company now conceded that MacPhail was right , the glass in the picture window was defective and it would be replaced . MacPhail looked over some letters his secretary had typed and signed half a dozen or so . An automobile dealer called and MacPhail told him he had decided to buy the Jaguar sedan he had been trying out . He would also take a new Chrysler. // Suddenly the tempo stepped up : Mrs. MacPhail came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room ; his trainer , Frank Whiteley Jr. , called from Delaware Park and said Miss Thing , the filly that had won three straight races , was running a fever and would probably have to be scratched from the Polly Drummond Stakes . MacPhail signed , dictated , shuffled papers , talked on the phone and then , abruptly , at the peak of activity , the library door opened again and Jeanie MacPhail walked into the room , her toy flute in her hand . MacPhail stopped everything , put down the phone , looked at her and grinned . " My , " he said , " if you do n't look nice . " // " Thank you , " said Jeanie . Then , frowning a little , she held up the toy flute and said , " This is the day I have to play in the chorus . Could you listen to me play it through and tell me if it sounds all right ? " // MacPhail leaned forward , cocked his head and said , " Go ahead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding ever so slightly . Jeanie played on without faltering , the notes came out as strong and true as a toy flute can make them . It was Shoo , Fly , Do n't Bother Me , unmistakably Shoo , Fly , played unerringly to the end . // Jeanie lowered the flute . MacPhail looked at her . Then he slapped the table and exclaimed , " You 've got it ! That 's it , that 's perfect , you 'll knock ' em dead . " // " Thank you , Daddy , " said Jeanie , turning away . // " Wait a minute , " cried MacPhail . Jeanie turned at the door . // " Who 's in first place with you ? " MacPhail said archly . It was an old game between them and he knew the answer that was coming . // Jeanie smiled and said , " David Russell . " David is a red-headed 9-year-old neighbor so untouched by sophistication that he spells MacPhail with an F. // " That bricktop is still beating me out ? " exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2. " // MacPhail shrugged his shoulders . " Well , that 's not too bad , I guess , " he said . // Jeanie closed the door behind her . MacPhail leaned back in his chair and peered out the window to watch her go down to the walk to the car . // The phone rang . MacPhail picked it up and listened . Then he started to talk . It was n't clear just what the discussion was about or who the caller was . // Whoever he was , MacPhail gave him hell .
