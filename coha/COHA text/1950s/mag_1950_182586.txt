Gabriel Gonzalez Videla , President of Chile , is the leader of a country whose 5 million people are known as the yanquis of South America-a mildly left-handed compliment to their drive and thoroughness . The U.S. has returned the compliment by giving Chile more financial aid than any other South American government . This week , accompanied by his handsome wife Rosa ( nicknamed " Mitty " ) and daughter Sylvia , 51-year-old President Gonzalez was scheduled to arrive in Washington for a state visit . <P> Up to the last minute , the wiry little President worked frenziedly to get ready for his trip . He settled three strikes , negotiated a political truce in a land-tax fight , and otherwise battened down the hatches for his absence . A pianist with a fine sense ) of harmony , he sent an aide scurrying through Santiago shops to track down a copy of The Missouri Waltz . <P> Adeste Videla . During his three weeks in the U.S. , Gonzalez will stay with the Trumans at Blair House , visit New York , Philadelphia , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his tour , Chileans hope that their President , who already enjoys the esteem of U.S. Ambassador Claude Bowers and the State Department , will make strong new friends for their democratic country among the U.S. public and Government . <P> Smooth-talking , never at a loss for words , natty , beak-nosed Don Gabriel is his country 's ablest salesman . His ready politician 's smile and his man-to-man manner are so convincing that political opponents have been known to avoid his company lest they be hypnotized into agreement . <P> <P> A classically flamboyant latino , Gonzalez is vivacious , gay and hot-tempered ( he once threw an inkpot at a congressional opponent ) . He functions in perpetual excitement , moving from desk to desk , room to room , city to city . As President , he has sailed south to lay claim in person to a big piece of the Antarctic , crash-dived in a U.S. submarine off Valparaiso , and tipped over and nearly lost his life canoeing on a south Chilean river . He loves flying , is known all over Chile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his summer palace at oceanside Vina del Mar , Gonzalez gets in a three-hour canter , a couple of swims , an hour or two at the piano ( his current favorite : Brahms ) , and all the tennis there is time for . <P> The round of entertainments scheduled for his U.S. visit should not weary him . He is not only an indefatigable party-thrower but a devoted partygoer . At a state ball during his visit to Rio two years ago , he made the gesture of leaving with President Dutra at midnight , then returned , removed his presidential sash , and sambaed till dawn .
