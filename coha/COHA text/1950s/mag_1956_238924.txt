In France , where analysis of a man 's character from his handwriting is considered a science , Raymond Trillat has risen to the top of his field . He has built up such a large practice that 300 firms now call on him to describe the characters of job candidates from the squiggles they make on application blanks . But back in 1946 Trillat began a second career . " If you can study someone 's handwriting and deduce ideas about his character , " he reasoned , " why ca n't you reverse the process ? By modifying his handwriting , perhaps you can modify his personality . " <P> Strings &; Circles . An associate of the Psycho-Pedagogic Center of the University of Paris , Trillat has since won the support of doctors , teachers and psychologists for his success in clearing up mental disturbances in children by changing their handwriting . Last week he was in the Paris suburb of Levallois , putting 28 pupils through their paces in what seemed to be an ordinary class in penmanship . But whether he told a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to concentrate on such rounded letters as a , b , and g , he always had his reasons . At 47 , Raymond Trillat is known in Paris school circles by a high-sounding and eminently respectable title : grapho-therapist . <P> When he first began his experiments with children , Trillat found that many of their inner problems showed up clearly in their writing . The introverts had difficulty connecting their letters ; the timid tended to squeeze all theirs together . Gradually , Trillat concocted a set of corrective exercises designed to give children a sense of " continuity , creation and equilibrium . " In overcoming a defect in any one of these elements , said he , a child must first develop a feeling for rhythm , melody and harmony . <P> Plaits &; Sedatives . Trillat found that many neurotic children , some of them stutterers , could not follow through . " There were children who could n't even open a door with a single gesture . They would pull it in a series of hesitant , jerky movements . " Such cases he starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to variations " . For the particularly nervous he designed special " sedative exercises " TW , and for the unstable , a series of plaits to develop " continuity in a discontinued movement . " Those who squeeze their letters practice broad , sweeping motions , and those who spread their letters too much through lack of a sense of harmony must develop a consciousness of space and balance by each child is encouraged to find his own creative personality by forming his letters individually , and to develop equilibrium by slanting his writing in one direction and making his letters all one size . <P> In ten years Trillat has treated more than 600 children , claims to have cured or helped at least 500 . All too often , he has found , emotional problems lead to illegibility , and illegibility leads to more emotional problems . Like remedial reading , says he , grapho-therapy does not change the basic personality ; it is merely one way to break down certain kinds of emotional barriers . " In many cases , " adds one Paris expert , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to write can contribute to emancipating them from deeper problems and help their personalities to blossom .
