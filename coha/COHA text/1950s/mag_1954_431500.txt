International Nears Photos  | Walking down one of the long , red-carpeted corridors in London 's Buckingham Palace one day was one of the dignitaries of the realm . solemn and bemedaled . Coming from the opposite direction was His Royal Highness the Duke of Cornwall , Duke of Rothesay . Earl of Carrick . Baron of Renfrew . Lord of the Isles , Prince and Great Steward of Scotland . In one hand the Duke held a toy locomotive ; with the other he made the wide . sweeping gestures of an engine driver pulling his whistle cord . As he came abreast of the visitor , he stopped and asked , " Where are you going ? " " To see the Queen . " " Who is she ? " " Why . she 's your mother . " The Duke 's face assumed a puzzled expression . " Oh . " he said . After a few seconds he resumed his whistle blowing . The Duke , of course , is Britain 's Prince Charles . the future ruler of the world 's last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that extra question . which might . for a while . have satisfied his curiosity , he was obeying Rule No. 1 in the education of a prince ? he must not ask strangers too many questions . Rule No. 2 ? he must not show favoritism ? is one that has never caused Prince Charles real hardship . for he is a bright , engaging child who has a sunny outlook on things . Yet sometimes it is a bit difficult . Recently . taking a stroll in the grounds of Buckingham Palace . he stopped to offer some candy to a young police constable on duty near a gate . The policeman saluted and took a piece . Charles looked behind him at the detective who always follows him around and said , " I am afraid you 'll have to give me that one back . My friend likes that sort best of all . " Life , of course , is full of such situations . and one must learn to deal with them , especially if one is a prince . Sometimes the training is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake hands politely with officials whenever he attends a function . Once . out with the Queen Mother . he saw the moment coming up . The trouble was that in one hand he held a toy rabbit and in the other a piece of toffee . There was no place to put the rabbit , so he tugged at his grandmother 's sleeve and said , " Please hold my toffee . " The Queen Mother , whose well-known graciousness copes with any situation , delicately took the toffee between two gloved fingers while her grandson shook hands with complete seriousness . All this is important business , for the British have , without  | doubt , developed the education of princes to a fine art . Strict regulations have already been set down for Prince Charles . He must obey his nurse . He must not run away from her . He must look straight ahead and not turn around and stare . He must not address strangers unnecessarily or accept gifts or candy from them . He must not use nicknames for anyone , even his familiars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not throw food about . He must be in bed by 7 p. m .. , and that means in bed . tucked in and lights out . He must always thank people for kindnesses . This latter rule Charles has developed into a fine art . A few months ago . after a tea party at the house of a court official , he walked up to his host 's mother and said with a perfectly straight face . " Thank you for having me to tea . " Unfortunately he added , " But why did n't you come to greet us at the porch ? " How difficult and complicated the art of being royal is can be appreciated if it is remembered that always , on every occasion , a royal person , however young , is the center of interest and curiosity . One of the most endearing pictures of the young prince was taken over two and a half years ago ; it showed him , supported by his nurse , standing on the garden wall of a London palace waving to a military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princely elbow was the capable adult hand of Nurse Lightbody , showing Charles just " how to . " Saluting comes to him naturally , from watching his father , Philip , Duke of Edinburgh . Charles always imitates his father in every gesture ? taking off his hat as he does , shaking hands , trotting along a pace or two behind him . " Us men " is the Duke of Edinburgh 's phrase when referring to himself and his son . The father-and-son relationship is perfect . Whenever Philip goes for a swim in the private pool at Buckingham Palace , he takes his son for a piggyback ride the whole length of the pool to get him used to water . He bought Charles a tiny cricket bat and taught him how to hold it . A keen rider and a polo player himself . he gave his son , then two , a pony no bigger than a large Saint Bernard dog . But whether he is with the Queen or with his father , Prince Charles is always , to a certain extent . on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to detect good points as well as bad ones . The little boy 's restlessness at the Coronation . for example , was apparent to all observers . The ordeal of press photography is one he has to undergo constantly . Imagine the effect of a hundred flash bulbs exploding at once close to the face of a five-year-old ! Think of the difficulty of posing for pictures while appearing not to pose .  | In many small ways , the Prince 's formal education has already started . At four and a half he could sign his name legibly . ( And millions of Welshmen in Britain hope that before long he will be allowed to add P for Princeps Prince after it , for they confidently believe that the Queen will make her son Prince of Wales before very long . There has not been one for eighteen years . ) Charles ' memory is also being trained daily . His nurse and attendants read stories to him , and he is encouraged , though not forced , to remember whole passages from them . He is a stickler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing class . As yet Charles ' dancing consists of stamping around to martial music ( his favorite march is " The British Grenadiers " ) , but all this helps to give him poise and confidence . Later on he will be trained to stand for twenty minutes of every hour of his lessons . Anyone who has stood a long time on parade will realize how important this training can be . The Queen had her own share of this " stand on the balls of your feet " routine from the age of ten onward . Charles ' curriculum will be far more extensive than that of an ordinary boy . Greater attention must be given to the history of England , the United States , and the continent of Europe ; he will have to wade through weighty tomes of constitutional history and procedure , for nothing is dearer to the monarchist than precedent . His French will have to be faultless , for that language is still used extensively at official receptions at court . His knowledge of geography must be above average , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contemporary advances in the fields of sciences and the arts . Above all he will have to listen , study , and remember , for royalty must always be aware of things and people . He must become a first-rate conversationalist , for it will be he who starts the conversation when meeting people . Even now Charles is never at a loss for an opening gambit . Recently , meeting Mrs. Casey , wife of Australia 's Minister for External Affairs , Charles said , " Surely we have met before . I never forget a face . " There is some doubt whether Prince Charles will go to a university . His mother did not . By the time she was old enough , during the war , she had joined Britain 's women soldiers and was tinkering with the inside of an automobile . Some people close to the court believe that a real-life education is more useful than the conventional polishing off . If he is like his father , Charles will enjoy that part of his education best of all . It is extremely unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " until he is well into his teens . The Queen now prefers that everyone , including the royal servants , call him Charles , not Prince Charles , and above all , not Charlie or Charley . ( The first and last time this nickname was used was when Princess Margaret mischievously stated , shortly after the boy 's birth , that henceforth everyone would refer to her as " Charley 's aunt . " ) Meanwhile , Charles ' life resembles that of any child in an upper-class British household . The Buckingham Palace nursery , with wide windows overlooking Constitution Hill , is not especially elaborate . It has light-blue walls and rather battered mahogany furniture . Its cupboards hold many of Charles ' favorite possessions : his collection of toy soldiers ( to which his father keeps adding ) , two clockwork trains , some mementos from Canada gathered by his parents during their Canadian tour , a stationmaster 's whistle and green starter flag , an autograph book , a few toys left over from last Christmas ( those from the Christmas before have long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park at the back of the Palace , a cage shelters Harvey , Charles ' favorite Angora rabbit . Charles sees his mother at least twice a day ? at ten in the morning , when the royal children are taken to the study on the floor below for a fifteen-minute chat , and again at six in the evening , when both royal parents visit the nursery for what can be described as a family romp . Quite often , at other times during the day , Charles peeps into the Queen 's apartments for an extra chat , or plays cricket with the Duke of Edinburgh on the back lawn . Very fond of the telephone , he frequently calls Princess Margaret on the Palace exchange . He is fond of TV , but his watching is rationed . By seven Charles is sleepy . ( Incidentally , his bathtime is in the morning , for the Queen believes that a bath at night would interfere with his sleep . ) He is tucked in by Nurse Lightbody . If he cries during the night , his cries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' room next door . Outside his door stands a footman on duty , and above this guard 's head is a red light , which will flash immediate warning of fire in any part of the Palace . If during the day Prince Charles leaves Buckingham Palace , he is always accompanied by at least two people , Nurse Lightbody and the Scotland Yard detective in charge of his safety . But the latter is very inconspicuous . To the London crowds , Charles is just another little boy taking a walk in the park . It is a long time since so young a boy was heir apparent to the British throne . In years to come , he will be watched , aided , and groomed for one of the world 's most arduous jobs . Behind him will be centuries of experience and the help of those who can teach that most difficult thing : how to be a good king in a world that now has so few of them .                @ @ @ @ @
