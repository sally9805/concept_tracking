In Yugoslavia 's picture-postcard resort of Bled , in a villa once built for the royal family of Yugoslavia , Communist Tito last week signed a 20-year " treaty of alliance , political cooperation and mutual assistance " with Greece and Turkey . Just six years ago , Tito 's Yugoslavia was arming Red guerrillas fighting in Greece ; a generation ago , Greeks and Turks were deep in a bloody war with one another . The new alliance joined together three nations with more than a million soldiers under arms : Turkey , 450,000 ; Yugoslavia , up to 600,000 ; Greece , 125,000 . <P> Actually , the pact is not as toothy as once intended . Originally , Greece and Turkey would have had to go automatically to Yugoslavia 's aid ; once involved , they could have demanded assistance from their NATO partners ( including the U.S. ) . But Tito , who is not in NATO , would not have been committed to help Greece and Turkey if they became involved in NATO action away from home . So NATO itself objected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to buy a dollar 's worth of NATO protection for 50 cents . " After much rewording , the pact now calls for all three members to meet and discuss effective means of rendering assistance in the event of an attack on one . In practice , Greece and Turkey will consult NATO before helping Yugoslavia ; Tito will consult with them if they get involved in NATO commitments away from home . <P> Behind the haggle over details , however , is the common conviction that in case of real trouble , all are in it together . Thus the new Balkan pact , in effect , closes the last gap in NATO 's ring around Europe , which begins in Iceland and extends to Mount Ararat . So happy did Tito feel about the whole thing that at the party after the signing , he passed word around that he meant to celebrate until the small hours ; anyone who was sleepy should forget about protocol and leave ahead of him .                 @ @ @ @
