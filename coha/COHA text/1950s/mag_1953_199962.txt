To the statisticians in Washington 's Labor Department , the U.S. economy never looked healthier or in finer balance . <P> Employment last week was at a record peak for spring ( 61.5 million ) and so were wages ( average factory earnings of $1.74 an hour , up 10 over a year ago ) . In 1953 's first quarter , the building industry showed a 6% gain in new construction over 1952 's first quarter - a strong indication for continued prosperity . <P> <P> In an orderly fashion , deflation continued to melt away some of the economy 's excess fat . The cost of living had dropped enough by last week to bring pay cuts , ranging from 1 to 3 an hour , for more than 2,000,000 workers , whose escalator contracts are tied to the cost of living . But most workers accepted the cut without protest . <P> Clouds . Despite the statisticians , a few clouds troubled the spring air . Used-car dealers , whose sales usually jump with the warm weather , were worried over the number of cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly , and dealers ' inventories ( nine cars apiece ) were not considered high . A bigger question was how fast consumers will continue to buy the mounting flood of 1953 models pouring out of the plants ; production has now reached a record rate of 7,000,000 cars a year . <P> The public has plenty of money in its pocket . National income rose , in the first quarter , to a rate of $304 billion v. $288 billion in the 1952 period . Nevertheless , some economists worried about the " danger " of consumer credit , which is now at an alltime peak of $24 billion . Many a lender , notably the Bank of America , biggest in the world , began to tighten up on small loans , as businessmen talked of a possible recession if an end to the Korean war brought sharp cutbacks in rearmament orders . <P> Sunshine . Was there any justification for such a fear ? Last week the House-Senate Economic Committee gave a reassuring answer . Vermont 's Senator Ralph Flanders , the committee 's vice chairman , reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are agreed that " direct identifiable expenditures on Korea account for only 10% of military spending , or $4-$5 billion a year . . . Private investment plans should not be altered by a Korean truce from the present high levels , and there is no evidence of excess capacity in industries where additional investment is now planned , e.g. , electric power . . . Present inventories are not considered excessive relative to rates of sales , and consumer expenditures seem likely to continue stable to rising . " <P> In short , said the committee , the only thing which could cause a recession is the fear of one . That could happen , said Flanders , only if employers , anticipating Government cutbacks , retrench more than the facts justify .
