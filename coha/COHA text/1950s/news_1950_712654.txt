txt John L. Lewis opened an offensive today aiming to checkmate the Government 's injunction suit against him and to paralyze imminent action by the White House to invoke the national emergency section of the Taft-Hartley Law . The president of the United Mine Workers offered to renew negotiations with the Northern operators who had broken off parleys by walking out of a meeting on Oct. 21 . His proposal " to negotiate in good faith , without stipulation , qualification or commitment " was made in a telegram to George H. Love of the Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Company . Mr. Love , spokesman for the operators ' negotiating committee , inJ a letter sent to Mr. Lewis yesterday and made public , today offered to ! the union a contract for two and a ' half years . He set forth a seven point program that he proposed as ' " the basis " for renewed parleys . Lewis Cites News Reports Avoiding any reference to Mr. Love 's letter , Mr. Lewis based his acceptance of the proposal on a statement in his telegram that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The telegram added : " If this be true I advise that representatives of the United Mine Workers will meet with representatives of your group at the Statler Hotel , Washington , D. C. , at 10 A. M. , Wednesday , Feb. 1 , to negotiate in good faith , without stipulation , qualification or commitment . " Significantly , Mx . Lewis selected the time for the projected meeting to coincide with the hour fixed for a hearing in the Federal Court here on an application for an injunction to restrain him and the union from coercing the operators into signing an illegal contract . The general assumption here is that if the projected conference takes place Mr. Lewis ' lawyers will , on Feb. 1 , advise the court that the bargaining meetings have been renewed in good faith and that therefore a temporary injunction should not issue . Or , they might urge at least that the argu- , ment be further postponed pending possible agreement on a new contract . Denham Voices Approval That Mr. Lewis had partly succeeded in his stratagem became apparent at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Relations Board , gave his blessing to the conference proposal . Mr. Denham , who issued the complaint against the union chieftain and the union , said : " If Lewis and the operators can sit down and work out a legal agreement , nobody will support them faster than I will . " The NLRB general counsel and the White House , however , still have as their weapons in the court action and the contemplated invocation of the Taft-Hartley Act the wholesale stoppage of some 90,000 miners . These coal diggers , hitherto working a three-day week on Mr. Lewis ' orders , are striking for a new contract and a full five-day week . Dr. James Boyd , director of the Bureau of Mines , told the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee yesterday that a coal emergency was here or near at hand . This statement was cleared at , , he White House , according to reports , and was intended to pave the way for action by President Truman early next week . Mr. Lewis , an adept at reading " the signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on contemplated Administration action , apparently saw a way to stymie the major actions under way against him . In informed circles , however , it is believed that neither Mr. Lewis , nor the operators nor the White House has " played the string out . " The " off-again-on-again " strike , either two.days or five days a week , is still on . Therefore stocks of coal continue at the danger point , according to Dr. Boyd . It is therefore regarded as possible that Mr. Lewis may express more firmly than hitherto his desire that the miners on strike now return to work . Last week he " suggested " that they return . He may also end the three-day-week production in favor of four or five days , perhaps for a month , in . order to get the country over the sump of the present shortage to . void an eighty-day Taft-Hartley injunction . Mr. Denham has charged that Ale union leader was using the curtailed week to coerce the operators into signing an ill gal contract . The Love-Lewis correspondence created some consternation among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northern group of its plans and were first inclined to feel that Mr. Love 's proposal had " spoiled everything . " It was the Southern Coal Producers Association that first pressed the complaint against Mr. Lewis and the miners under the Taft-Hartley . Act . The association had no comment on today 's action . It was pointed out , however , . that a month ago its president , Joseph E. Moody , sent a message to Mr. Lewis offering to resume negotiations , but that no reply had been received . The Lewis-Love move . also took by surprise the National Coal Association , whose nation-wide advertising campaign on the coal dispute began today. , R. H .. Knode , president of the association , wired all directors and secretaries of local operators associations today to confer in Washington on Feb. 2 . Latitude Seen in Talks In some legal quarters here the " stipulations " set forth in Mr. Love 's letter to Mr. Lewis were taken to mean that the operators wished to discuss the proposals ' set ( forth . in the communication , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , advance of the Imeeting .. This view was that the letter was just like any union proposal ' to confer , which made certain specific demands , offering , as did Mr. Love , " to negotiate a new contract * * * on the basis of * * * " these demands : Mr. Lewis , it was indicated , obviously did what , in the same circumstances , employers do , namely , to say that he . would negotiate without advance commitment , The operators , if a meeting is arranged , can bring up any proposal and so can the miners . Hitherto the miners have been insisting that the major operators concede what a small number have reported to have agYreed to do , increase basic wages from the present $14.05 to $15 a day and payments into the welfare fund from 20 to 35 cents a ton . The operators have refused any concessions that they feel will increase coal prices . Senator Harley M. Kilgore , Democrat , of West Virginia , told reporters today that President Truman was " working as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hopes for results . " He had told the President that his own state , at least , was suffering an . emergency . " I do n't know whether there is a national emergency or not , , but so far as West Virginia is concerned it is definitely an . emergency , " he said . . ?
