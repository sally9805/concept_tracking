GHOST ON HORSEBACK , THE INCREDIBLE ATATURK ( 408 pp. ) - Ray Brock-Duell Sloan &; Pearce ( $4.75 ) . <P> Out of the ruins of the decayed and defeated Ottoman Empire rose a new Turkish republic that stands today as democracy 's strongest bastion in the Middle East . This was the achievement of one man , Mustafa Kemal Ataturk . After World War I he raised a new army and drove out the Greeks , who were occupying Turkey with Allied backing . He threw out the established Moslem religion , warred on the fez and the veil , forced Western clothes , laws , letters and institutions on 16 million bewildered Turks . Through all the years of dazzling leadership , this bitter , sullen , debauched son of the Salonika slums never seems to have loved a soul ; he abandoned his innumerable women and he killed many of the men who worked most closely with him . <P> Once Ataturk invited the diplomatic corps to a champagne party at his villa overlooking Ankara ; when the binge ended at dawn , the diplomats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition leadership hanging in the square . With Ankara under his heel , Ataturk toured country districts announcing that Islam " is a dead and finished thing . " Returning suddenly after eight years ' absence to " that cesspool " Istanbul , he summoned notables to a grand ball . Before the band played a note , Ataturk himself stepped , chalk in hand , to a blackboard and for four hours lectured the jaded heirs of the Ottomans on the new , latinized language he had ordained for the republic . <P> Author Ray Brock ( Blood , Oil and Sand ) , who spent five years as war correspondent in Ankara and Istanbul , has written-or overwritten- the first fulldress biography of this tremendous figure since his death . But the book is too crammed with imagined detail to gratify either history or Hollywood . When Author Brock tries , in a sort of romantic , Irving Stone style , to read the great man 's thoughts , the portrait of the remote and terrible Turk turns into semifiction . After an early setback , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and like that monstrous egg in the rhyme for children , you had a great fall . " In the end , Author Brock 's purplish flights-the old roughneck gallops off as a kind of ghost rider in the sky-obscure the black-and-white facts of Ataturk 's life , which was more fantastic than any biographer 's invention .
