" A new growth to watch is the abstract expression which derives rather heavily from nature . " In so saying , Painter Carl Morris , 44 , speaks with personal knowledge . His own nature-influenced abstractions rate one-man shows up and down the West Coast , and hang in nine U.S. museums . San Francisco Art Critic Alfred Frankenstein calls Morris " the best painter in Portland , Ore. , and one of the best in the United States . Like some of his colleagues , Morris seems to be returning to nature with the very free technique of nonobjective painting . " In Morris ' one-man exhibit at Manhattan 's Kraushaar <P> Gallery last week , the evidence was clear that Painter Morris has pushed his technique to a new combination of recognizable objects and abstract design . <P> Morris is the first to admit that much of his inspiration comes from Pacific Coast landscape . To find it , he need go no farther than the front door of his cliffside house , where he lives with his wife , Sculptress Hilda Morris , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , very Oriental . This dissolves into misty atmosphere and double horizons . There 's a vertical and horizontal thing going on , with the trees making the verticals . " But Morris punctures the critics who have made a cult of the North west 's Orient-influenced mysticism : " I guess I 've got a mysticism that is n't mystic . If it looks Oriental , it is because of similar environments . Remember , in the Orient nature was always the teacher . " <P> The big element Morris has learned from nature is the importance of space . Says he : " In the Northwest , you see either close up or far away . " In From the Waterfront ( see cut ) , done in soft shades of grey with only small punctuations of color , the painting close up has the tactile sense of smoothed concrete ; seen from a distance , it becomes a moody study in perspective . <P> Morris draws a sharp line between his own abstractions , with recognizable objects looming out of the background , and the prevailing trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight in overall painted surfaces " is like looking into a window loaded with fascinating , kaleidoscopic objects . But in multiplying one area of excitement until it moves right off the canvas , they 're not painting abstractions ; they 're just repeating details . "
