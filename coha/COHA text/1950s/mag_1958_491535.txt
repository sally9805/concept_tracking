The manuracture of these precious pieces of paper , these tokens of value which glide through our hands every day , is a larger and more complex operation than I had realized . The skills and k ninvhow involved has , : grown out of trial and error  --  plenty of error  --  dating back to Colonial times . All our paper currency is printed by the Bureau or Engraving and Printing , a division of the Treasury Department . in its big building on 14th Street in Washington near the Potomac River . in the year ended last June thirtieth , it printed over 1.6 billion individual notes having face values running from $1 to $100 each , and a total face value of more than $6,000,000.000 . ( No denominations higher than $100 have been printed since 1946 , though several hundred millions ' worth of the large notes are still in circulation . ) The person primarily responsible for printing this supercolossal annual bankroll is the director of the bureau , Henry J. Holtzclaw . He is a modest . conscientious career man who started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved up through the ranks by study , brains , ability and hard work . The weight of last year 's output of paper money was 1674 Ions , If laid out end to end the notes would form a money belt girdling the earth six times . It is an enormous production job which must be carried out with the utmost precision . During the various stages of the printing the notes must be counted and recounted , inspected and reinspected . Each finished note is a specimen of the engraver 's art of such quality as to make counterfeiting one of the more hazardous crimes . The cost of this printing operation last year . including the many security precautions which must surround it , was about $15.000.000 . The cost per note was just under one cent , whether it Was a SI or a S100 bill . Of the annual printing of 1.6 billion notes , the bulk , or about 1.000,000,000 , arc El bills . Next come the 55 bills , over 250,000,000 of them , and the 510 hills , over 200,000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sir slight that only about 10,000,000 are printed a year  --  this because or an old superstition that 52 bills are unlucky . How this started nobody seems to know . Whatever the cause of the superstition , the result is a loss to the taxpayer . If the $2 bill enjoyed a normal popularity , we would print at least 150,000,000 of them a year , and thus would need to print 300,000,000 fewer of the 51 bills . This would save over 51,000.000 a year . It 's an expensive superstition  --  enough to make rational old Thomas Jefferson , whose portrait graces the $2 bill  --  turn over in his grave . It was Jefferson . by the way , who gave the name to the dime , deriving it from the French dixierne , or tenth ( part of a dollar ) . The word was originally spelled " disme " and pronounced " deem . " The word " cent " was invented by Gouverneur Morris . or New York . Our word " dollar " came via Spain from the German word " Thaler. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a large silver coin first minted in St. Joachim 's Valley ( Thal ) , Bohemia . in 1519 . After this glance at the oldest Thaler. or dollar . let 's look at the newest : the SI bill . series 1957 , which began to go into circulation in October , 1957 . This note , though seemingly almost identical with the old 51 bill , represents the most substantial change in our paper money in many years . Outwardly , the chief change is that it bears on its back , just above the big " ONE . " the motto " In God We Trust . " From the production standpoint . the important difference is that the new notes are printed by a radically new and more c11kietil procen , They are turned out by high-speed rotary presses , printing on dry paper . The old flat presses , printing on Wet paper , are gradually being replaced . We Trust " first showed up On coms in 1864 . It all started stint a letter which the Rev , N. R. Watkinson , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Salmon P. Chase , then Secretary of the Treasury , urging " the recognition of Almighty God in some form on our coins . " It took more than two sears of discussion and debate before the change was authorized by Congress . Many forms were suggested , including " Our God , Our Trust , " and " Our God , Our Country . " Chase himself apparently chose the final wording . " In God We Trust , " It first appeared on the bronze two-cent piece . and was added over the ' years to other coins . I base been unable to learn when its cruel companion phrase , " All others pay cash , " first appeared on the walls of barrooms and other cynical emporia . As for Chase himself , he is one of the three non-Presidents honored by having their portraits on our paper money . The two others are Franklin . on the 5100 bill , and Hamilton , on the 510 . ' But the picture of Chase is inaccessible to most , since it appears on the 510,000 bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God We Trust " appeared on our coins , we never got around to putting it on our paper money . Why not ? This question was raised in 1955 by a constituent of Congressman Charles E. Bennett , of Florida . Mr. Bennett , a former combat infantryman and winner of the Silver and Bronze Stars , decided to do something about it . He introduced a bill requiring that all future new issues of our money , coin or paper , bear the motto . It was passed and signed by the President . While working on this law , Congressman Bennett was surprised to learn that the United States had no official national motto . So he drafted another bill , duly enacted . which provides that " the national motto of the United States is hereby declared to be ' In God We Trust . ' " ( Poblic Law 851. 84th Congress . 2nd Session . ) I doubt whether many of our 170,000.000 citizens realize that this is now the law of the land , though Francis Scott Key foreshadowed it closely in 1814 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be our motto : in God is our trust . " The 51 bill is the only one which contains Latin mottoes  --  three of them . They appear on the back of the bill as part of the Great Seal of the United States . On the right you sec the familiar " E Pluribus Unum . " On the left , in larger letters , you see " Annuit Coeptis " and " Novus Ordo Seclorum . " Though we see these two latter phrases every day , how many of us have ever noticed them , or know what they mean ? ( Certainly not I , until I got tangled up in these monetary researches . ) But they must have meant much to Franklin , Jefferson and John Adams . who formed the first committee on the Great Seal on July 4 , 1776 . I am told that " Annuit Coeptis " means " He ( Cacti Smiles on Our Undertakings " and that " Novus Ordo Seclorum " means " A New Order of the Ages " ( ushered in by American independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face anothcr Latin phrase which is not a motto , but which is ( a ) a misstatement and ( b ) an example of either wishful thinking or of large ideas , as you please , among the Founding Fathers . On the right-hand side of the face of every note , circling the Treasury seal , you will see the letters which arc an abbreviation for " Thesauri A =mac Sep ten triona I is Sign lum . " This means " The Scat of the Treasury of North America , " Thus even during the Revolution , the vision of the Founders embraced the entire continent . So far as I can learn , neither Canada nor Mexico has ever protested this overstated , universally circulated assertion of our sovereignty . If you study tiny piece of United States paper currency , you will he astonished at the intricacy and variety of its pattern , Besides the portraits and vignettes there arc many different styles of lettering , of numbers , of ornament , of scrollwork and tracery , The natural question is : Why not make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the bill is designed not to please the eye , but to baffle the counterfeiter . The ornamentation on any bill is not the work of one man . It is the assembled work of many gifted engravers and specialists who have worked for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing over the last ninety-five years . For example , the face of Lincoln on the 55 bill was engraved by Charles Burt in 1869 ; that of Washington , on the SI hill , by G. F. C. Smillic in 1918 . Other noted portrait engravers were A. Sealey , who did Jackson ( $20 ) in 1867. and John Eissler , who did Franklin ( $100 ) , McKinley 15500 ) , Cleveland 610001 , and Madison 155000 ) during the 1920 's . Mr. Holtzclaw , director of the bureau , calls the portrait engravers " the unsung heroes " of our paper currency , Unknown to the public , they arc public protectors , since their workmanship is the hardest part of a bill to counterfeit . If you suspect that a bill is a phony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait , and compare it with a genuine note for distinctness , fineness of line and the expression of the eyes . Some feel that the vignette and letter work require just as much skill . Look at the Lincoln Memorial on the back of the 55 bill . This was engraved by Joachim Clarence Benzing , now retired and living in Florida . With strong magnification you can read the names of no fewer than twenty-six states on the building . Consider the precision and steadiness of hand required for such work . Benzing also engraved Independence Hall as shown on the 5100 bill . I had been told that the clock on the Hall showed twenty past two . But when Mr. Holtzclaw and I examined it under twenty-fold magnification , we read it as ten past four  --  a judgment apparently confirmed by the shadows around the building . Recent observations of the actual clock  --  from the windows of The Saturday Evening Post in Independence Square  --  show the hands stopped at ten minutes past ten  --  apparently while new works are being installed . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is of no one make . The engraver , L. Schofield , deliberately drew it as a composite of various cars in use at that time  --  around 1927 . The skill , care , art and thought which have gone into making our paper money are based not on finicky whim . but on the hard lessons of the past . In earlier days counterfeiters not only gypped the public on a grand scale but messed up the whole currency system . Counterfeiting is an ancient crime . As soon as men learned to use money as a medium of exchange , other men learned to fake it . The most savage punishments failed to stop the practice . In the Roman Empire counterfeiters were mutilated , burned alive , thrown to the lions . In Europe , during the Middle Ages , they were punished by having their ears and noses cut off , by torture , and by death . In Merrie Olde England they were drawndisemboweled  --  and quartered . But so long as money was easy to fake , the temptation was irresistible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spring up , Many of the older currencies were so debased that trade was driven back to the clumsy processes of barter . America experienced comparable troubles . in the early Colonial days , currency was scarce and Indian wampum was widely used as a medium of exchange . Soon some of the simple Red Men , as well as certain of the less virtuous of the Pilgrim Fathers , were busily making and passing counterfeit wampum . As the colonies began to issue their own currency  --  coins and , later , paper money  --  the counterfeiting problem became increasingly serious . As the problem grew , the penalties were made more drastic : first , confinement to the pillory ; later , the loss of an car ; then both cars : then whipping  --  lashes on the bare back , " well laid on . " Terms of imprisonment were stepped up to ten years , to twenty , to life . Some of the colonies made counterfeiting punishable on the gallows , and printed on the paper money . in large letters , 715 DEATH TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death warning as easily and briskly as the rest of the bills . Currency , trade and the honest citizenry suffered accordingly . Our worst experience with counterfeiting occurred during the Revolution , The Continental Congress , to finance the war , issued paper money which at first held its value at par . The bills were called Continentals or Congress-notes . Private counterfeiters soon began faking the stuff . Then , far more serious , the British authorities got into the game , and circulated counterfeit Continentals by the millions . They flooded the country with them , through agents and loyalist sympathizers , and even advertised them in the newspapers . After Howe 's redcoats occupied New York . the New York Gazette carried this remarkable announcement : Persons going into the other Colonies may be supplied with any number of counterfeit Congress-Notes , for the price of the Paper per Ream . They arc so neatly and exactly executed , that there is no Risque in gelling them off .... The Continental currency began to slip in value , faster and faster , and within five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language in the phrase , " not worth a Continental . " No doubt the desperate uncertainties of the Colonial cause would have depreciated the money in any case , but counterfeiting hastened the collapse , Partly because of this experience , the new American republic shied away from paper money , confining itself to the minting of gold , silver , nickel and copper coins . The issuance of paper money was left to the banks . The state banks , particularly , printed bank notes in quantity and of bewildering variety . In the decades before the Civil War there were thousands of varieties of bank notes in circulation , so that it was almost impossible for the public to tell genuine bills from the bogus . Counterfeiters flourished . with little to fear from the ordinary police or from the private detectives who were sometimes put on their trail . Not until the early 1860 's , under the financial stress of the Civil War , did the United States issue its own paper currency . As an outgrowth of this , the United States Treasury created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . One was the Bureau of Engraving and Printing . The other was the United Slates Secret Service . The bureau , as we have seen , began assembling the learns of engravers , designers , artists and technicians which have made United Stales paper money ever more difficult to imitate . Also , over the years , it developed the new inks , materials and secret processes which have kept it several jumps ahead of the counterfeiters . Mr. Holtzclaw , chosen director in 1954 , owed his elevation partly to the fine work he had done , as chief of research and engineering , in improving quality , modernizing processes and reducing costs . The United States Secret Service was organized in 1865 by Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch for the specific purpose of " detecting and bringing to trial and punishment persons engaged in counterfeiting . " ( After the assassination of McKinley in 1901 , the Secret Service was assigned another nationally important task , the protection of the President . ) As the Secret Service developed into a highly trained elite corps , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were not more drastic , but ever more swift and sure . The Secret Service kept files on every known counterfeiter , in or out of prison , and his handiwork . Its experts could not only spot the finest counterfeit but often identify , in the laboratory . where and by whom it was made . And it had agents who , at the risk of their lives , lived in the criminal underworld , ready to pick up and follow the first whisper of any sizable counterfeiting operation . When the bureau and the Secret Service were formed , in the 1860 's , it was estimated that more than 30 per cent of the paper money in circulation was counterfeit . Their joint experilst. has driven this figure down and down , until it is now less than a thousandth of I per cent . In the year ended last June thirtieth , the Secret Service seized 5101,000 of counterfeit which had got into circulation , and 51,446,000 more from the counterfeiters before they could pass it , Compare this with the total circulation of about 529 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000,000 in coins . That is quite a record . But U. E. Baugh-man , chief of the Secret Service , is not in-clined to complacency . He knows that counterfeiting , however unprofitable and dangerous , has a powerful , irrational ap-peal to many ingenious persons , who lie awake nights thinking up new ' tricks and techniques . He knows , too , from experi-ence. that counterfeiting can pop up in the improbable places or among the TOM Impro most unlikely people . Two years ago , for example , a counterfeiting operation was discovered within the walls of a state prison in Speigner , Alabama . Three long-term convicts . in respectively for armed robbery , grand larceny and murder , were making 55 bills . How was this possible ? Well , it seems the prison had a print shop where certain state documents were printed . The enterprising convicts studied printing so assiduously that they were able , working from a genuine $5 bill , to turn out a fair sort of reproduction . They talked too freely , their plates were found , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of state prison . In 1955 the Secret Service broke what is called the Charley 's Aunt case . A new counterfeit 520 bill appeared in Los Angeles . Agents got on the trail , which led them to a theater where the comedy , Charley 's Aunt , was playing . As the agents went backstage an actor , who was awaiting his cue go oil , Viet ! to conceal two paper bags under the floor of the stage . The bags contained $9060 of the fake twenties . the actor was only a minor figure in the ring  --  a " passer . " Further investigation led to the capture of the makers of the notes , the plates and $400,000 of the fake twenties . In all , twenty persons were tried , convicted and sentenced . Last year , in a line old colonial mansion in the Massachusetts village of Worthington . there lived a seemingly quite respectable gentleman . His business also seemed most innocent : the printing and publishing of school yearbooks. had a nice family and was well thought of by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to that of the then Secretary of the Treasury . George M. Humphrey . Possibly the similarity exercised a power of suggestion . If George M. 's Treasury could print money by the billions , why should not George W. print a modest $100,000 or so ? Be that as it may , George W. 's neighbors were greatly shocked . a few months ago , when he was arrested on the charge of delivering 577 , - 000 in bogus 510 's and 520 's to a Secret Service undercover man . Agents said they found other thousands , along with elaborate counterfeiting equipment , in the basement of the old Colonial manse . Experts described the notes as " very deceptive . " but few got into circulation . One of the first SIO 's passed came into the hands of an unusually eagle-eyed gas-station attendant , who thought it did n't look " quite right . " This put the Secret Service on the track . The biggest counterfeiting operation in recent times was initiated by Hitler , Himmler and Heydrich at ( he start of World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgers but chemists and other scientists , and set them the task of producing perfect imitations of Bank of England notes . They eventually developed notes  --  according to Wilhelm H 601 , an Austrian engaged on the project  --  so good that they passed the scrutiny of banks in neutral countries . They were printed by the millions , and used to support the Nazi espionage system in foreign lands . Eliazna Bazna , the notorious spy who worked as valet to the British Ambassador in Turkey ? " Operation Cicero " ? was paid off in these bogus British notes . When America entered the war , Hitler set his experts to forging United States paper money . Apparently they found this extremely difficult , for , says Hiittl , it was not until early 1945 that they came up with phony American notes on which the engraving and printing were judged close enough to perfection . Even then the notes were rejected  --  the paper was defective . Hitler 's paper fakers were still fussing with this problem when the war ended . The special quality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only after the work of the bureau and the Secret Service as a protection against counterfeiting . This paper has been made since 1879 in the mills of one family , the Cranes of Massachusetts  --  and that is a story in itself . In 1799 young Zenas Crane pushed westward and founded , in the little town of Dalton , Massachusetts . the first paper mill in that part of the country . Soon he was advertising , in the Pittsfield Sun : AMERICANS ? ENCOURAGE YOUR OWN MANUFACTURES AND THEY WILL IMPROVE . LADIES , SAVE YOUR RAGS ! Zenas and his descendants continued to " improve " their manufacture , spe cializing in unusual and high-quality papers , Today the great modern mills in Dalton are still owned and operated by the WSW Crane family , of the fourth , fifth and sixth generations . In one of those mills , under strict United States guard and inspection . is made till the secret-process paper on which Our money is printed . During the 1870 's United States currency was printed on paper containing jute , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents a pound . In 1879 the Secretary of the Treasury laid down strict new specifications for a distinctive , high-quality rag paper and called for bids . Many paper manufacturers competed , wining and dining officials who they thought might be helpful , Quiet young Winthrop Murray Crane , grandson of Zenas , did no lobbying , but kept his large ears open . A few minutes before the deadline he slipped away from his competitors , who were gathered in the old Rights House , and sprinted hatless and coatless to the Treasury with the bid which won the contract at 38.9 Cents a pound . From that day to this no other company has been able to compete with the Crane currency paper in quality and price . Recent prices arc around sixty-five cents a pound , which is still less than the seventy cents which the Treasury was paying when the Cranes entered the field in 1879 . Every year invitations to hid are sent to fifty other makers of fine papers , but they all seem willing to leave this complex specialty to Crane and Com-pany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engraving and Printing through the decades to improve the distinctiveness and durability of the paper . The present product can lake 2200 double holdings , along the same crease , without breaking . Machines lest this , as well as tensile strength , resistance to puncture , and so forth . The basis : raw materials in the paper arc cotton and linen . While much of the manufacturing process is secret , I sin able to disclose ash-lilt that the hides of the Indian water buffaloes have played an important part . Until Pearl Harbor , that is , when the supply was cut off The chemists went to work , and this precious ingredient is now obtained from the hides of certain American animals that shall remain anonymous . The Pacific war changed another feature of the paper . See those tiny red and blue fibers in the unprinted portion of your paper money ? They used to be made of Japanese silk . After Pearl Harbor , nylon fibers were substituted . When nylon for parachutes and aerial towing cables became critically short , cotton fibers were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its composition is secret , but it can be readily identified in the Secret Service laboratories . There is a public belief that if you can see the fibers , the currency is sure to be genuine , Chief Baughman warns that this test is not infallible : a few counterfeiters have been able to imitate the fibers well enough to deceive the unskilled naked eye . Despite the all-around quality and durability of our paper currency , it eventually wears out under public handling . When notes become so limp , dilly and worn that the Federal Reserve banks judge them not fit for further circulation , they sire retired and replaced by newly printed notes . The $1 hill , which gets the hardest usage , lasts an average of thirteen months . The higher denominations last longer , ranging from about two years for the 55 to more than ten years for the $50. r hus each year , of the $29,000,000,000 of paper money in circulation , about 1.6 billion pieces , of a face value of $6,000 , - 000,1100 ? corresponding roughly to the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then comes the question of what to do with this vast volume of old , but still passable paper currency . Shred it ? Bleach it ? Grind it up for salvageable pulp ? All these processes have been tried and found too expensive . The old money is burned . Some of it is burned in the incinerators of the various Federal Reserve banks . But the larger denominations , including all Federal Reserve notes , to the tune of sonic $5,000,000,000 a year , are sent back to Washington and burned under the expert supervision of John F. Moran . Mr. Moran is chairman of a remarkable Treasury committee of which few have ever heard  --  the Destruction Committee . He has been its chairman since 1927 , and was a member of it for seven years before that . As such , he has had more money to burn than any other man in history  --  upwards of S109,000,000,000 worth . The four other members of the committee , appointed by the Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , are also trusted civil servants of long experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning money , and can talk most learnedly on the subject . it is not easy to burn great bundles of money so that no scorched notes may survive . Special incinerators , or " destructors , " are required , with tiring chambers , combustion chambers and plenum lor settling ) chambers . The chimney must be screened just so , lest any money escape . The draft must be exactly right . If too strung , ash drifts over the neighborhood . If too weak , you get " smoul der " ? incom p lete combustion . Every barrel of the final ash must be wetted down and inspected before it is carted off to the dump . Mr. Moran is the world authority on his specialty . After Pearl Harbor , when we feared the Japanese would capture the islands , he was sent to Hawaii to burn $70,000,000 , of American currency so that it could be replaced by distinctive , brown-seal notes . stamped " Hawaii , " which the Japs could not pass in foreign lands . After the war , the British paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned some 525,000.000 in American currency . It would hase cost many thousands of dollars to ship this money back to the United States under proper guard . On the morning I spent with Mr , Moran , in the basement of the bureau annex , he and his colleagues burned up 525,000.000 ? an average day 's work . Of this amount 1 was allowed  --  under the vigilant eyes of the Destruction Committee  --  to throw two bundles of S20 bills ( $160,000 ) and two of SIO 's ( $80,000 ) into the roaring flames . Casually  --  just like that . Al the beginning of this article I suggested that I acquired no cash for myself from my sojourn among the multimillions . This is not exactly accurate . When my researches ended I complained to Mr. Holtzclaw that I had performed a useful service in burning the $240,000 , and had not been paid . Next day I received a nice note from him , containing one dime for disme , or deem ) . The trouble is . I 'm afraid to spend it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will put the dime in escrow pending some word from the Supreme Court .
