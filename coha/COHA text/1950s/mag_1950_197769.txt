Edgar Bergen waltzed onto the floor of Las Vegas ' Desert Inn last week with blonde , willowy Podine Puffington , who " speaks " with a syrupy Southern accent . Though only five feet tall , Podine has a 32-inch bust and 19-inch waist . Because of her light plastic construction , she weighs only 25 pounds . <P> Ventriloquist Bergen ordered the new $3,000 puppet because he suspects that tall puppets might be more successful on television than knee-sitters like Charlie McCarthy , who originally cost $75 . Podine is also more mechanized . Charlie and his stablemate , Mortimer Snerd , are controlled by broomstick handles ' in their backs ; pushbuttons under Podine 's hair make her roll her eyes and bat her flirtatious lashes . Podine has only one dress , will get no more until she clicks on TV.
