Testing trends before next year 's congressional elections , Pollster George Gallup last week announced some answers to a Galluping theoretical question : if you had to register today , would it be as a Democrat or Republican ? To nobody 's surprise , 53% of those questioned went Democratic , including 59% of those not now registered with either party . But to nobody 's surprise as well , the G.O.P. had carved extensive inroads since the question last was asked in 1954 . At that time Gallup found a 20-million voter spread between parties ; in 1957 the difference had dropped to 12.7 million , and the gap-closing was occurring in important areas : 1 ) among voters not now committed to either party , and 2 ) in the desolidifying South , where 26% of those questioned said that they would register Republican , compared to 18% who chose the G.O.P. three years ago .
