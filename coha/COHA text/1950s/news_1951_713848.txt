Dawson , President Truman 's administrative assistant on patronage , swore today to the Senate subcommittee investigating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation . that he never exercised or had any influence over directors of that agency or had anything to do with its lending operations . A report involving him , issued by the investigating group on Feb. 5 , used " misleading language " that left " erroneous .. impressions , " Mr. Dawson said . He asserted subsequent inquiry had failed to prove charges against him or to support implications . Mr. Dawson insisted that he did nothing improper fit accepting on three occasions a total of some three weeks of free accommodations at Miami Beach 's fashionable Saxony Hotel , which had received a $1,500,000 loan from the R. F. C. However , he said he would not do it again . He declined to discuss the propriety of the acceptance of similar hospitality at the Saxony by David K. Niles , another administrative assistant to the President ; Brig . Gen.

F. C. loan . He also knew , he said , that at one time Mr. Young was employed simultaneously by Lustron and the F. L. Jacobs Company of Detroit , also an R. F. C. borrower . Mr. Young 's salary from the Jacobs company was $10,000 according , to previous testimony . Mr. Young , whose wife , until'recently was a White House stenographer with a $9,540 mink coat that figured in previous testimony , // was disclosed to have left the city without filing notice of his new whereabouts . ?

The witness said he asked Mr. Dunham , before the latter took his post , whether he could work " in harmony " with the Administration and Mr. Dunham said he could . The question , Mr. Dawson insisted , was not to impose a condition of appointment but to sound out the nominee concerning his attitude toward R. F. C. objectives in the public interest . Although he was a long-time friend of Mr. Young , who came from the same Missouri county , Mr. Dawson testified he never interceded on his behalf for employment or R. F. C. favors . While his social associates had , included a group of R. F. C. directors and borrowers and others interested in agency matters , . he said , the subcommittee had been unfair in drawing the implications it did from their occasional meetings at luncheon here or at the summer home of Rex C.

C. or Ahalf of loan applicants , including letters from members of Congress , Mr. Dawson asserted . Of the few letters he saw , Mr. Dawson said , none indicated that members of Congress had taken fees for work on R. F. C. loans .

Plan Mr. Dawson declared that he knew nothing about plans reportedly made at a house party at Mr. Jacob 's Florida home for a group including Mr. Young to seize control of the Lustron Corporation from Carl Strandlund , its president .
