 | " If only you were bigger , so you could be my bodyguard . As it is ? " For the first time something unfamiliar in the room caught her attention and she stopped in her pacing . Someone had placed an oblong pan upon her dresser  --  a pan containing rocks and sand and a half-buried saucer-pool . Three small turtles snoozed in the cool sand . Why had Jemmy brought his turtles in here ? Had he feared that they too might be taken from him ? Or  --  was there some other meaning ? She ran suddenly to the door and unlocked it . Then she slipped out before the puppy could bounce after her . Across the hall Jemmy 's door stood closed , but she turned the knob and flung it open . The room was empty and Jemmy 's coat and cap were gone from the clothes tree that stood near the head of his bed . She knew now why he had left the turtles in her room . He had entrusted them to her in his absence . Jemmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away .  | LORA STOOD quietly in Jemmy 's small room , trying to think . He could have gone only a few moments before , so he was not far away . She had no concern that physical harm might come to him before he would be found . But the danger of spiritual harm was great and she wanted to think carefully about what was best to do . Someone should go up the woods path , since it was quite possible that he had gone up the hill to his grandfather . Perhaps she had better set Peter on that course at once . Then she herself would go over to the Lords ' and see if he had gone there . She ran back to her room for her mantle and bonnet , and as she went out she remembered to lock the door and take the key with her . There would be no stealing away of the puppy behind her back . Then she went downstairs to the library , where Wade still sat with his head in his hands . " Your son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'd best send Peter up to Mrs. Channing 's to see if he has gone there . I am going to the Lords ' to look for him . " There was dismay in Wade 's eyes now and he got up at once . From within the parlor where she kept lonely vigil with the Christmas tree , Mrs. Tyler was ringing her silver bell furiously , and Ellie came padding in from the back of the house . " You may tell Mrs. Tyler that Jemmy has run away and that I 'm going down to the Lords ' to see if he is there , " Lora directed , and went out hurriedly . The snow was not deep and the wheels of vehicles coming  | to last night 's party had packed it firm in places so that walking was not difficult . Nevertheless , unused to snow and icy ruts , Lora slipped once or twice and caught her balance with difficulty . As she passed the opening to the uphill path she tried to tell whether Jemmy had gone that way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might well have stepped into his tracks . At Serena 's she rang the bell and waited impatiently for a sleepy maid to come to the door . No one but the boys were up as yet , the maid told Lora . After the late party last night the whole household was asleep . No , Jemmy Tyler was not here that she knew of . As Lora hesitated , wondering where to turn next , Adam Hume came down the stairs . " Merry Christmas , " he said , and then noted her expression . " Is anything wrong ? " She went to the foot of the stairs . " It 's Jemmy . He has disappeared . His grandmother tried to take the puppy away from him . He did n't realize that I would n't have let her take him . I 'm afraid he has run away . " " To his grandfather 's ? " Adam asked . " I thought of that . Peter has been sent to look . I 'd hoped he might have come here . Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post , thinking , while the maid went away to her duties . " I know one possibility . It 's not very sensible , but I 've heard him mention it  --  and he might try . " Lora would have questioned him , but he ran back up the stairs . " I 'll get into my coat and take the cutter . He might have gone downhill . Suppose you go home and I 'll drop in later , whether I find him or not . " There was something comforting about Adam 's way of quick decision , quick action . She hurried back to the house and just as she reached the gate he drove by , saluting her with his whip . He was apparently never one to waste time or wards .  | Wade was waiting in the hall as she entered the house . He leaned upon his crutch , contrasted in his helplessness with her recent glimpse of Adam . " If I could just get out and look myself ? " he began . She thrust the unfair comparison from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Do n't worry . Jemmy ca n't have gone far . The important thing is what we are going to do when he comes back . " He returned her look coolly . " You realize that you have brought this whole thing upon us with your foolish act . Why did n't you tell me what you were planning to do ? " " Because I wanted Jemmy to have a dog , " she said , and went past him up the stairs . She could hear the silver bell chiming its summons from the parlor again as she went into her room . The puppy had left a puddle in the middle of the floor and he had managed to get a corner of the bed quilt between his sharp little teeth and make a nice pulpy mess . Lora sighed and went about cleaning up . " It 's a good thing I 'm convinced that you 're worth all this trouble you 're causing , " she said . When she had talon off her things , she locked the puppy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his mother were in conference there and the old lady looked up angrily when Lora came in . Surprisingly , Wade smiled at his wife . " I 'm trying to persuade Mother that if we keep this little dog out of her sight and train it well from the beginning it will really not be much bother and will not intrude upon her at all . Apparently it means a great deal to Jemmy . " " He should not be rewarded for running away , " said Mrs. Tyler . " In any event no further argument or discussion is possible . I will not have a dog in this house and that is final . " Lora went closer to the hearth and sat down on a low footstcol , but her gaze did not leave the old woman 's face .  | " Did you never have a pet of your own as a child ? " she asked gently . " My father did not believe it healthy to keep animals in the house . I agree with him thoroughly . When my husband was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rid of them . " " Then I 'm very sorry for you , " Lora said . " You 've missed so much . Doc  --  my father , that is  --  always said a boy could n't grow up healthy unless he had a dog to love him . " " Then your father was not a doctor I would care to consult , " Mrs. Tyler snapped . That was probably true , Lora thought , though she said nothing . Doc 's notions would likely have shocked such a patient . Before Mrs. Tyler could find further words the doorbell rang again and Lora sprang to her feet . " That must be Adam . Perhaps ? " But Mother Tyler 's words stopped her before she reached the door . " Remember  --  the dog goes . " " No , " said Wade , " he stays . " Lora forgot the door and turned quickly , her eyes on Wade 's flushed face . " Do you mean that ? " " The dog stays , " he said again , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I leave this house . " They could hear Ellie in the hall , then Adam 's voice . Lora pulled open the parlor door and saw Adam stamping the snow from his feet on the mat , with Jemmy , little and cold , beside him . " Jemmy ! " she cried . " Come quickly where it 's warm . You 've frightened us all . Come in , Adam . " She did not realize until she had spoken that she had dropped the " Mr. , " but formality did not seem to matter now . Adam drew Jemmy into the warm room with him and said good morning to Wade and his mother . " I found this young man on his way to Camp Herndon down on the flats . He was going to enlist in the Union Army  | as a drummer boy . It took a bit of persuading to get him to believe that they are n't taking drummers quite so young as yet . " " I 'll make them take me ! " Jemmy looked about him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , " Lora said . " He 's upstairs in my room waiting for you now . " Jemmy 's eyes widened in disbelief . " But Grandmother ? " " Your father says you are to keep him , Jemmy . Wade , tell him so ! " He turned a look of disbelief upon his father and Wade smiled a bit wanly . " That 's right , boy . No one is going to take the little dog away from you . " Lora stole a hasty look at Mrs. Tyler . The old lady was watching Wade in outrage . Her face was crimson and she looked as if she might be holding her breath . There would still be trouble here . But Jemmy waited for no other corroboration . He tore out of the room and Lora went after him , close to tears . She saw Adam 's look as she brushed past him , and for once there was no mockery in it , but only admiration . She did not care what Adam thought . She ran after Jemmy and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , they went inside together . The puppy had taken to chewing on the rungs of a chair , but he turned from this interesting occupation to welcome them with joy . Down on his knees went Jemmy and already the little dog seemed to know the smell of his master for he paid no attention to Lora , but fairly leaped into Jemmy 's hands . " He 's mine , " said Jemmy in wonder . " He 's really mine . That 's right , is n't it , Loriei Papa said so . " Lora blinked the moisture from her eyes and sat down on the bed to watch this loving reunion . " That 's right , Jemmy . Now you 'll have to name him . We ca n't go on calling him Puppy and it . ' " Jemmy took his nose out of the puppy 's neck and held the  | small , wriggling body at arm 's length . But no name seemed to come to him . " What do you think , Lorie ? " " Well  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could call him Star . Or you could call him Spot , or ? " But Jemmy dismissed her list with a disapproving headshake . " I do n't like dog names . I want a special name . If he was a little girl dog I might call him after you , Lorie . Because you gave him to me . Papa said I could keep him , but maybe it would mix things up if I gave him Papa 's first name . " " I think it very well might , " said Lora solemnly . A light came into Jemmy 's eyes and he gave the puppy a little shake . " I know ! I 'll call you Hamlin . Hamlin 's the hero in Papa 's book and that will do perfectly . " Lora looked at him quickly . " You mean your papa has read you his story ? " " Well , no , not exactly , " said Jemmy , setting Hamlin down on the floor . " But it 's always in the library desk and so one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not approve of that , you know . Not without his permission . " " Mm , " said Jemmy doubtfully , and then poked the puppy with his toe . " But I want to call him for my father in some way . " " You could keep his whole name secret for now , " Lora suggested , " and just shorten it to Ham . " " Ham , " said Jemmy , trying it out thoughtfully . " Ham , come here , sir . Come here , Ham . " The puppy cavorted over to him at once and put on a wriggling performance that nearly shook him in two . " He knows that 's his name , " Jemmy said in delight . Then a sudden thought seemed to strike him and he looked at Lora . " When 's your birthday , Lorie ? " " Goodness ! It 's not till July . Whatever made you ask ? " " We 'll have a party for you , " Jemmy cried . " And I 'll start making you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lora said . " And I have presents from you . " " I know . But I want to do something special for you , Lorie . Like you 've done something special for me . " Her eyes misted again and she did not attempt to blink the tears away .  | NOT UNTIL LATER did Lora know what had happened in the parlor that day after she and Jemmy had run upstairs . Mrs. Tyler had risen from her wheel chair before Wade could stop her , to take several steps across the room and collapse at his feet . She had been in bed ever since . She had refused to see the doctor Wade had sent for , nor would she allow Lora to come near her . She simply lay on her pillow with her eyes closed most of the time , eating little , withdrawing from life . Lora suspected that the cure would be simple . They had only to get rid of jemmy 's dog and his grandmother would recover promptly . But so far , to her surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Lincoln 's January first Proclamation of Emancipation , of which Mrs. Tyler had approved so intensely , served to rouse her interest . " She is trying to die , " Wade said dully . " I 've seen her do this before . That time when she fell downstairs . Sometimes I think she would rather die than not get her own way . " He sat on the sofa before the library fire , while Lora stood at a window looking out at the , thawing landscape . It was midJanuary and after a stretch of extremely cold weather the sun had come out bright and warm . Snow ran in dirty rivulets down the hill and the road had turned to a sea of slush . " She 's behaving like a spoiled child , " Lora said . " What happened when she fell downstairs ? How long ago was that ? " " Immediately after my first marriage . " Wade leaned over absently to add more wood to the fire . " It was a shock to her  | when I married Virginia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How did she come out of it that time ? " Wade did not answer for a moment , remembering painfully . " Virginia managed it . She was so sweet and loving that no one could resist her . Not even Mother . Even she came to accept Virginia , though she could never forgive what she regarded as a lowly background . " He sighed and Lora , hearing , went to him quickly and dropped on her knees beside him . " You have n't let me talk about it , my dear . But now I must . I think you were splendid on Christmas Day when you told Jemmy he could keep his dog . It has meant everything to him . I 'm sure you must have noticed the change . He even whistles sometimes now , as a boy should , and he looks at you with his heart in his eyes . But you still hold him off , Wade . Why ? " He moved restlessly . " I 'm not holding him off . It 's just that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to talk to him , or what to say . " " Anyway you stood up for him . That 's what matters . " He looked at her in the cool way that was growing familiar . " I did n't do it for Jemmy alone . I 'm trying to hold to something of myself this time . Always before , my mother has forced me to her pattern . And for me , that is a pattern of failure . " She leaned against his knee , eager now , and earnest . " You must be what is right for you to be . Just as I must be what is right for me . Believe in yourself , Wade . " The chill which put distance between them went out of his eyes . He rested a finger beneath her chin , tilting her head toward the lamplight . " You 're always so alive , Lora . I 've felt that in you from the beginning . Perhaps that was the thing which drew me toward you when I was near death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . When Vir-ginia ? " " No , " she said , drawing away from the touch of his finger .  | " Not Virginia . Not me . You must do it yourself , Wade . That 's the only way there is . " His smile was not altogether happy . " You 're still young enough to believe that a mountain can be moved if only you push at it hard enough . " " Perhaps I do , " she said . " Perhaps it 's even true . " He bent to kiss her cheek lightly and stood up . " I must go and read to Mother now . She pretends not to listen , but I think it pleases her nevertheless . Though in the end she 'll win , I 'm afraid . She always does . " " Not this time ! " Lora cried valiantly . " Wade , what of your book ? Do n't you work on it any more ? " " Sometimes , " he said . " But perhaps that 's only a dream ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a volume from the table and went out of the room . Lora sat where she was on the hearthrug beside the sofa . The feeling of his kiss was still light on her cheek and she reached up to touch the place with her fingers . Strange that when he kissed her she could always feel more lonely than before . But her loneliness was n't important . If only there were some way in which she could really help him . Just then there was a yelping and scampering up the front steps and she heard Jemmy coming home from school . She roused herself and went to the door of the library . It was wiser for both boy and dog to keep as quiet as possible when they came inside , but these days in his new confidence that his father would stand by him , Jemmy did not always remember . Lora smiled and put a finger to her lips . But this time Jemmy did not need the warping . He bent to pat the little dog and soothe him so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered down the hall and up the stairs with an exaggerated air of secrecy , before he beckoned Lora into the library . Once inside , he closed the door and held out an envelope to her . " Rebecca brought it , " he said . " It 's a note from Morgan Le Fay . Rebecca saw me on the road when she came out of the  | woods and she said to give it to you when no one else was around . She 's waiting on the woods path for an answer . " Lora slit the envelope with a brass paper knife from Wade 's desk . The note was brief . Could Lora visit Morgan Channing any time this afternoon ? Something important had come up and Lora 's help was urgently needed . Why should she go ? Lora wondered . She neither liked nor trusted this woman . And yet at the same time she was intrigued by her . The note was both puzzling and provoking , and it certainly aroused her curiosity . There could be no harm in at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " Jemmy asked . " What does she want ? " Lora tore the note into small bits and dropped them into the fire . " Mrs. Channing wants me to come up to see her for a little while this afternoon . If Rebecca is waiting in the woods I 'll go back up the path with her now . " Jemmy 's eyes took on a shine of conspiracy . " I wo n't tell , Lora . If anybody asks I 'll say you 're having a nap in your room . " " Thank you , Jemmy , " she said quickly , " but of course you must n't do that . I 'd be very unhappy if you told fibs to keep me out of trouble . There 's nothing wrong about going up to see Mrs. Channing if I choose to do so . " " Just the same , I wo n't tell , " he promised her . There was no convincing him that intrigue was not necessary in this house of intrigue and though she could not admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence until she had time to discover what Morgan Channing wanted . For the last two weeks a seamstress had come daily to the house . In spite of Mother Tyler 's indifference to what went on , Wade had seen to the matter . As a consequence , Lora 's new wardrobe had begun to blossom and she could now put on a soft wool dress of turtle-dove gray , most stylishly made and trimmed with velvet of a darker shade . She felt quite another person in it , though she smiled at herself for gaining confidence from the mere donning of a new frock . At least she need not mount the hill today with the knowledge that  | she would seem dowdy and countrified beside the impressive Mrs. Channing . Her new bonnet was gray too , with a touch of warm pink color under the brim , and her gray mantle was far warmer than her old one . Jemmy , playing with Hamlin on the drive before the house , looked up as she came down the steps . " You look nice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hamlin and I. " Their course down the muddy road was somewhat less than elegant , but Jemmy was a help in guiding her along the least soggy patches of grass beside the road . Hamlin wallowed happily to his ears in mud and then had to be restrained from leaping upon Lora in the ecstasy of farewells . " I 'll take him right home and give him a bath , " Jemmy promised . " Here 's Lora , Rebecca . " Rebecca said good afternoon in her usual soft-voiced manner and turned at once to lead the way uphill . Lora waved to Jemmy and followed her . The springy path of dried leaves made more comfortable walking than the road , but Lora had to give considerable care to her swishing skirts . As the young colored girl went ahead , straight-backed as Amanda Tyler , with her head held proudly high , Lora felt her old curiosity sweep back . More than once she had wondered about her life up there in the Channing mansion , wondered about her as a person . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked of the straight back ahead of her . Rebecca did not so much as glance over her shoulder . " It 's fine up here , ma'am , " she said . " Do you have friends here on Staten Island ? " Lora went on , probing a bit more personally . There was the briefest of pauses before the girl answered . " I would n't rightly say I 've got much time for friends , ma'am . " " But you must have time off and friends to visit ? " " Watch the mud there , ma'am . " Rebecca turned to hold back a flapping branch .  | Lora sensed that she had been mildly rebuked . By no least word did Rebecca mean to betray her real self to a strange white woman . This was no new thing to Lora . There had been many Negroes in the town she had come from , and they had always been friendly , courteous , helpful  --  but you never knew what they were thinking . You never penetrated past the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to get past that guard and get them to talk to him , forget their caution , be themselves . When they reached the turn on the path where it wound about the woodland pond , Rebecca moved more quickly and kept her gaze from the shimmering pool , as if she shrank from looking at it . " I suppose you knew Miss Virginia , did n't you ? " Lora asked , still seeking a way past the guard that held her off . Rebecca moved more quickly than before . " Yes 'm , " she said . " A real nice lady she was . That was a sorry thing that happened , ma'am . " For an instant she glanced around at Lora , but her eyes were blank , unrevealing . They saw , but they did not betray . " Wait ! " Lora cried . " I 'm out of breath . Let 's stop a minute and rest , here by the pool . How beautiful this place must be in the springtime . I can hardly wait for warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real winter . Did you have trouble getting used to the cold , Rebecca ? " The girl shivered , but Lora could not be sure if it was because she had mentioned winter , or because of the nearness of this pond where Virginia Tyler had died . " Yes 'm , " the girl said dutifully . " It was real hard to get used to . " She stood with her back to the pond , resembling some wild , richly plumaged bird about to take flight . Lora walked down the bank to the edge of the water . " Jemmy says it 's very deep out there . " " I reckon that 's right . " The girl turned suddenly , showing her first sign of emotion . " Mrs. Tyler , this is a bad place . If you want to rest , we can go a mite higher up the hill . " But Lora took quick advantage of this slipping of the mask .  | " Miss Virginia 's death must have been a tragic thing for everyone , Rebecca . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad place . We must n't blame the water , or the trees , or that rock out there , you know . The place is still beautiful and good . " The girl watched her , wide-eyed for a moment . Then heavy-lashed lids drooped once more over dark eyes and she started quickly up the hill as if she did not care whether or not Lora followed . She almost ran now , as if some demon from the pool pursued her , and Lora followed after , knowing there was no use in trying to dispel whatever haunting lay upon that pool for Rebecca . They reached the big house without further conversation and Lora was ushered at once into the drawing room , where only one fire burned today . Somehow the room looked austere and cold and less richly glamorous than it had to Lora 's eyes the first time . Rebecca took her wraps silently with only a murmured acknowledgment when Lora thanked her , and went off to summon her mistress . This time Lora did not seat herself timidly before the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look out upon the brilliantly sunlit view . How wonderful it must be to occupy the very crest of the hill , instead of being tucked away in a hollow below . From the upstairs windows of this house , both sunrise and sunset vistas must be magnificent . When she had her fill of the view , Lora turned back to the room . Her eyes searched out the great portrait at the far end , but today the painting of Morgan and Virginia had been hidden by the green velvet draperies pulled completely across the picture . Mrs. Channing came in so softly behind her that Lora was unaware of her presence until she spoke . " How nice of you to come , Lora . I may call you Lora , may I not ? I dislike formality between friends . " She wore black again today , with only a pearl brooch and earrings to relieve its somber hue . Yet she was not in mourning  | for her husband , since she had been gay in white and turquoise the night of Serena 's party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic quality , whitened her skin and made her dark eyes all the more brilliant . Morgan had not missed the look of interest Lora had been giving the hidden picture . She nodded carelessly toward the pulled draperies . " Sometimes I weary of looking myself in the eye . Particularly when I am my own sole company . " Lora smiled uncertainly and took the chair which a gesture from Morgan indicated . This woman always made her faintly uncomfortable and a little unsure of herself . " I 've been away , you know , " Morgan said . " To Albany . " Lora had not known . In the tight little world of the Tyler household , concerned more than ever with its own problems , little news of the outside world had penetrated for the last two weeks . " I attended Governor Seymour 's inauguration on New Year 's Day , " Morgan went on . " Mr. Norwood is very close to the governor , as well as being an old friend of my husband . Nicholas was always interested in the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . I like to be near the seats of the mighty . " She laughed at Lora 's puzzled expression , and rang the little bell at her side as a signal for Rebecca to serve tea . " I can see that you do n't approve of a woman who interests herself in politics , " she went on . " But I can not see myself sitting idle and alone in this great house . I want activity and life about me . Important activity . " " It is n't that , " Lora confessed . " It 's just that  --  well , the other day you seemed to speak very sincerely about wishing there was some way to stop the war . And now ? " " I am sincere , " Morgan broke in . " That is why I 've asked you to come here to see me today . " Rebecca moved unobtrusively and hardly lifted her gaze from the tea tray and the passing of small cakes . Her gold earrings tapped her cheeks gently as she bent to serve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or antagonisms she might feel behind her golden brown mask , there was no telling . When she had gone from the room , Lora stirred sugar into her tea and spoke thoughtfully . " Did you know that Rebecca is afraid to go past that pool in the woods ? " Morgan shrugged . " That 's natural enough with these people . I presume they are all ignorantly superstitious . " Lora let her words pass , though Morgan 's tone caused a prickling of sensitivity along her nerves . She had spent too many years in the company of her father to accept so careless a dismissal . There was more behind the masked exterior of this colored girl than Morgan knew . " What sort of life does she have up here ? " Lora went on . Morgan looked as surprised as if she had inquired whether the mantelpiece spoke French . " Life ? How should I know ? She serves me well and I pay her well . I 'm not concerned about her personal problems . I doubt if she has any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . " How charming you look today , Lora . Gray becomes you far better than green . " Lora set her teacup down and met the other woman 's eyes . " I did not wear your sister 's gown by choice the other night , I 'm sorry if it disturbed you . " " Why should it disturb me ? I 've told you there was little affection lost between my sister and me . From the time when we were small children , we had no common meeting ground . It 's a fable that blood relatives should necessarily like each other . But I have n't asked you here to talk about Virginia or Rebecca . From something you said the other day I gathered that you would lend your help if you could , toward any movement which might lead in the direction of halting this dreadful bloodshed . " " That 's quite true , " Lora said . " Good . First , I 'd like you to know that we have Governor Seymour on our side . Of course , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not with any show  | of force , at least . But he will sanction what we do and will lend us behind-the-scenes support . Have you heard of the Knights of the Golden Circle ? " " Vaguely , " Lora said . " I 've heard them labeled Copperheads . " " Many people do n't understand their work and purpose , " Morgan said blandly . " The Circle is opposed to the continuation of the war . Its members want a peaceful settlement with the South and they are by now many thousand strong in the Middle West . Murray Norwood is one of those chosen to start new castles in the east . " " Castles ? " Lora asked . Morgan smiled . " Between you and me , Lora , I will acknowledge that there 's a good deal of the small boy in many men . They like to dress up , use passwords and exchange secret handshakes . They love the mystery of the secret society and all the trappings that go with it . If I go to the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Morning cometh , ' and all the rest . But let them have their ritual if it appeals to them . Let them have it if it will stop the war . " She had set her tea and cakes upon the table beside her and was leaning earnestly toward Lora . There was no doubting her sincerity now , or her driving intensity . " But what can they do ? " Lora asked . " You 've heard of the coming draft , have you not ? " " I do n't know much about it , I 'm afraid . " " What an ignorant little thing you are ! Do n't you realize that the Union can not possibly win this war unless it has more men ? But men of the North are no longer flocking like sheep to throw their lives away . If President Lincoln can not raise his quota the war will stop because it will be impossible to fight on . Stop the draft in New York State , as they are going to stop it in other states , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can the draft be stopped ? If the government ? " " Ah , but you do n't know the power we have on our side . We have a magnificent leader out in Ohio  --  Clement Vallandigham.  | And Governor Seymour himself is opposed to the draft . We have only to organize and stand fast . " Lora sighed . " I 'm afraid I am ignorant of all this . In any case  --  what do you want me to do ? " Morgan glanced toward the closed velvet draperies and grimaced . Then she rose and strode the length of the room to fling them open so that her counterpart , more beautiful , but less vital , looked down upon the room . Morgan turned and came toward Lora , her smile flashing . " Now there are two of us on my side , " she said . " You can never hold out against us both . And the thing we ask of you is so simple , so easy . We need someone of influence here on the island . Someone who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other islanders . A man , of course . " She paused , watching Lora . " You mean  --  Wade ? " Lora asked , more puzzled than ever . Morgan returned to her chair and took up her teacup again with a gesture elaborately casual . " Of course . And you are the one who can draw him into this . " " I1 " Lora cried . " I 'm afraid I have little influence with him . Besides , what could Wade do ? His mother is very ill just now and he is not well himself . He has taken no part in island life since his return . " " But he did at one time , " Morgan said . " And he will again if it is urged upon him . He had a taste of it the other night at Serena 's party . Perhaps you have n't seen enough of that side of your husband to judge . He has always been extremely well liked and influential too , thanks to his name and position . We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you help us , Lora ? " Lora moved her hands in a gesture of helplessness . " You must know how he feels about  --  well , about this house . He would never , I am sure , agree to come here . " " I appreciate your delicacy , but we need not mince words . " Morgan 's smile was wry . " It is I whom he wishes to avoid , not the house . However , as you must know by now , it is child 's play to wrap Wade around your finger . You can get him here  | if you try . Not for my sake . I am nothing in this . But to meet Murray Norwood . Once Murray talks to him I feel certain that Wade will be with us . Then he can use his influence to draw in others to help us . " Lora shook her head , quietly stubborn in the face of Morgan 's assurance . " I do n't want to wrap Wade around my fingers , or to see anyone else do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what he believes is right . " Morgan nodded tolerantly . " You are honest , my dear , but you are also very young . There are certain facts you must face sooner or later . Believe me  --  I have known Wade all my life and I know he will always need a stronger hand to mold him , guide him . " Lora moved restlessly in her chair . There had been times lately when she had almost thought the same thing . But on Christmas morning Wade had stood up to his mother in the matter of the puppy . No one had made him do that . No one had forced his hand . In fact , the greatest pressure had been in the other direction , yet he had not so far given in to it . So there must be some core of strength in him that was his own . He had even confessed that he was struggling to hold something of himself away from his mother . " I think it quite possible that you underestimate my husband , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes flashed anger , and though she suppressed it swiftly , there was a tinge of irritation in her laughter . " You are a young wife in love , " she said . " I apologize . You must learn to know Wade for yourself , of course . I had no right to say such a thing . Suppose we start over . Two tremendously important factors remain . I believe you are sincere in wanting to aid in the cause of bringing this war to an end . I also believe you are sincere in wanting to help your husband recover from the shock from which he still suffers . To speak frankly  --  the shock of my sister 's death . Am I not right ? " " Of course , " Lora said .  | " Very well . Help him find something he can throw himself into  --  something he can do that counts . There lies the way to recovery . You have only to persuade him to see Murray Norwood . " Rebecca returned softly to the room bringing fresh hot water for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her aside somewhat impatiently and waited for her guest to speak . There was a reasonableness about Morgan 's words , Lora had to admit . She had touched on the truth concerning Wade and her counsel was good . Yet Lora felt helpless to judge the worth of the cause she proposed to work for . The word " Copperhead " had a smell of treason , as that man at Serena 's party had said , and she knew nothing of this so-called Circle . " I just do n't know , " she said at length . " Perhaps if it were only a matter of meeting Mr. Norwood , talking to him ? " " But that is all we ask , " Morgan said quickly . " Meeting him elsewhere . Not here , " Lora added . Morgan shook her head . " I am part and parcel of all this . Murray needs me , needs my house and whatever else I can contribute . The men who work with him must accept my presence and my help . I am accustomed to entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests to my house . This is an ideal location for a castle . But this is not something I expect you to run about and announce to the four winds . I weighed you carefully before I decided to make this gamble in talking to you . " " I understand , " Lora said . " But as for getting Wade to come to this house , I know it 's impossible . " Morgan went on as if she had not spoken . " First you will tell him that Murray Norwood is interested in a plan which will oppose the draft and become a force in halting the war . Say nothing of the Circle . Let us tell him about that . He may set the time for meeting Murray himself and the meeting will be in this house . " Lora shook her head . " The whole thing is hopeless .. I do n't know anything about the quarrel between you and Wade ,  | but I know he becomes very angry when your name is so much as mentioned . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . " A childish notion on Wade 's part . We had no quarrel . Nevertheless , there is one weapon you can use to bring him here . An infallible weapon . " Lora waited , instinctively ready to resist this woman 's persuasiveness . Morgan leaned forward in her chair and Lora noted that there were amber flecks of light in her eyes ; an amber that seemed to glow when she was moved to intensity . " Make him angry , " Morgan said . " Tell him that he is afraid of me , tell him that is why he avoids me . Tell him you think the war a more important cause than his own feeble fears . If you make him feel he must prove his courage , he will come . I know him , Lora . I know him clear through . " Lora regarded the woman before her with increasing distaste , but she managed to answer quietly . " The method you suggest would not be mine . I have too much respect for my husband . " She rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Morgan in spite of her lack of years . " I really must be getting back home now . It was kind of you to invite me here today , but I 'm afraid there is no way in which I can help you . " She was aware of Morgan 's anger , though the other woman 's manner remained carefully unperturbed . " What a contrast with Virginia you must make for Wade . How much suffering you must inevitably cause him ! " There was malice in Morgan 's laughter as she walked with Lora toward the door . Lora found herself surging with resentment against this woman . But she would not give Morgan the satisfaction of suspecting how indignant she was . At the door her hostess held out her hand and Lora put her own into it briefly . " I will expect to hear from you , " Morgan said . " Not for my sake , or for yours . But because I believe you truly want  | to help Wade . And this is an opportunity for doing so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and went down the driveway , sensing that Morgan stood in the doorway staring after her . All the way home she pondered Morgan 's words and motives . Was this a simple matter of politics as she professed , or was there in this woman a purpose which concerned Wade far more personally than she claimed ?  | BY THE END OF January Lora had still said nothing to Wade of the request Morgan had made of her . She did not mention her recent visit , though she had told him of her first trip up the hill and that she had obtained the puppy from Morgan . He 'd been distressed at first , but had eventually forgiven her . She had not , however , been able to dismiss her talk with Morgan from her mind . It was just possible that Morgan was right and Wade ought to have something like this to fling himself into . If Morgan 's cause was honest and just , the chance at least should be given Wade . But how could she be sure ? And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his displeasure and gaining only an angry refusal ? Matters in the Tyler household were no worse , though little better than they had been . Mother Tyler had decided not to die after all , but merely to remain in bed as an invalid . However , she consented now to sit up , demanded constant waiting on from Ellie , and wanted Wade at her side too much of the time . True , she was not as yet winning the fight in which Jemmy 's puppy was a mere symbol , but she was winning in other ways and Lora could only watch in distress . Wade had done little more on his book because he could never be permitted uninterrupted time to himself . No sooner would he shut him self in the library to work , than the silver bell would ring 11 demandingly and Ellie would come tapping at the library door with some request from his mother . Once Lora had quietly given orders that Ellie was not to disturb her master  | on any account , let the bell ring as it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill for several days . More than anyone else these days Lora missed her father . He would have had the wisdom and experience to deal with these problems . And he would have had the patience . Lora found her own patience wearing thinner by the day , until she was afraid that she might throw all caution to the winds and stride into the sickroom to take matters impulsively into her own hands . This , she well knew , might be disastrous because the battle was one she was helpless to win . She could only stand beside Wade and offer what comfort she could . These days jemmy was the one happy member of the household . He and Hamlin  --  whose full name had not been disclosed to Wade  --  even stole away from the house sometimes on Sundays because Adam was full of dog knowledge and was aiding Jemmy in the development of Hamlin 's personality and everyday good manners . Sunday rules had relaxed a bit for them all , now that Mrs. Tyler was bedridden . At Lora 's suggestion they had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers in the parlor . This , for the moment , was their only contact with social life . Whether Jemmy sensed the tension among his elders , and the cause of ? his grandmother 's self-imposed illness , there was no telling . It was enough for him that he had been able to keep the puppy . When , on the rare occasions of a visit to his grandmother , she would emphasize to the boy that the pain of her headaches was brought on by the noise of the dog scampering through the halls , or barking at night , Jemmy would turn a bright , blank look upon her and announce that Ham was sorry and did n't mean to hurt her , and was really trying very hard to learn . Lora had an account of these sessions from Ellie and knew that neither old woman nor small boy ever won or was defeated . But the tension in the household increased and Lora dreaded the possibility of a real explosion . Mother Tyler 's constitution was probably ironclad . She could make herself ill if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself to go down in complete defeat . It was Wade who would be more likely to give in under the strain . Lora felt increasingly that she ought to find someone from whom she might gain advice . Her thoughts turned often to Serena Lord . One bleak morning when it was snowing again , she bundled herself up and walked along Dogwood Lane toward the Lord house . Edgar 's leave had ended and he had rejoined his company , so she would not be intruding on Serena 's brief hours with her husband . The maid showed her into the dining room , where a fire blazed and where Serena , her red hair hidden beneath a house cap , her plump person encased in a voluminous apron , sorted piles of linen heaped on table and sideboard . Adam was helping her , having been pressed into such female service somewhat against his will . Lora almost bumped into him as he came through the dining-room door bearing a pile of sheets as high as his head . He grinned at her around the mound in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a welcome sight . Do intercede for me and obtain my release from bondage . " " Nonsense ! " cried his sister briskly . " You 've nothing else to do and you can run up and down stairs better than I. How nice to see you , Lora . Do come in . " Lora glanced doubtfully at the heaps of linen , but Serena forestalled any apology or effort to withdraw . She gave Lora 's wraps and bonnet to the maid and waved her to a chair before the fire . " There ! You shall sit and talk to me . A linen inventory is a tiresome task and Adam does n't feel talkative this morning . I 've been pining for company . " The room was doubly cheerful and warm in contrast to the snow blowing against the windows and the piling of white drifts in the garden . The air was fragrant with a scent of lavender and orris root sachet . " I would not have waited much longer for you to visit me , " Serena told her cheerfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your new life . Now you must get  | out and make friends , my dear , have some outside contacts . We see you only at church . How is the elder Mrs. Tyler ? " Through Jemmy 's visits to Adam , Serena must know something of the situation at the Tylers ' , but Lora could not tell how much Serena read between the lines . She explained briefly that Wade 's mother was somewhat better and then sat silent for a little while , watching the fire , wondering how best to broach the subject of the unhappy struggle for power in which Wade 's mother was engaged . She looked up to see Serena 's understanding gaze upon her . " Mrs. Tyler is doing the same thing she tried to do when Wade married Virginia , is n't she ? " Serena said . Lora nodded , reassured by the fact that she need make no explanation to Serena Lord . " One thing that puzzles me is the fact that she seems not to have attempted this when her husband was alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Tyler must have flouted her wishes and done exactly as he pleased . But she did n't take to her bed then . " Serena counted swiftly down a stack of pillowcases and made a mark on a sheet of paper . " For Amanda to take to her bed would never have worked with Jack Tyler . He 'd have been happy to have her out of his way . She knew that , so it was the last thing she 'd do . But she can hurt Wade and make him feel guilty . I 'm surprised that he has n't given in long ago on the matter of the dog . Just for the sake of peace , if nothing else . " " I 'm afraid he still may , " Lora said . " That 's one reason I wanted to talk to you today . I 'd like to help him , and I do n't know how . I 'm afraid I do n't even understand him very well . " Adam came in empty-handed just then and overheard her last words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I 'd like to hear about it . I 'd never have expected him to stick up for Jemmy 's dog in the first place . " Lora winced at the implied criticism . " I do n't see why everyone underestimates him ! " she cried . " You like to play the mother , do n't you ? " Adam scoffed .  | He might have said more , but his sister made a shooing gesture with her hands . " That will be enough . Off with you to that freedom you 've been begging for . Lora and I want to talk woman-talk . No  --  let the towels be . We ca n't have you constantly popping in here disturbing us . " Adam sighed exaggeratedly . " You can see what a henpecked brother I am , Lora . But since freedom has been offered me , I 'll escape before my sister changes her mind . " Serena shook her head as he went out , and a lock of bright hair slipped from beneath her cap and curled against her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him . He needs to be engaged in some furious activity . With these bouts of fever still laying him low , he ca n't return to action , or even work for long at any job . But now we 'll be able to talk without being picked on . " Lora sensed again the warm sympathy she had felt in this woman that first night when Serena had spoken to her on the ferry . " If I knew more about the past perhaps I could understand better how to help Wade , " she mused . " He must have had some quarrel with Mrs. Channing , though she denies it , and no one will tell me what it was about . " Serena sorted towels into piles thoughtfully . " If there was a specific quarrel I have n't heard the details . But there was a time when we all thought Wade would marry Morgan . Did you know that ? " " Mother Tyler told me , " Lora said . " She would ! There was always a spark between Morgan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her headlong way , but it always seemed to me a stormy affair with more quarreling and passion in it than any real liking . Fortunately he came to his senses and turned in what must have been relief to Virginia . " " How did he come to his senses ? " Lora asked . " What happened to make him turn to Virginia ? " Serena shrugged . " Again I ca n't give you the details  --  we only heard rumors afterwards . But I believe it was Morgan  | herself  --  some frightful thing she did that shocked Wade into seeing what she was . " " Mother Tyler hinted that she stopped the affair and broke it up . " " I do n't know , " Serena said , " but I do believe he 's still a little afraid of Morgan . " " I do n't see why he should be . " Serena paused in her sorting . " Even my Edgar admits that she has a decided attraction . More than one man whom she has n't particularly wanted has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've felt a bit sorry for Morgan at times . " " Why ever should you ? " Lora asked in surprise . " Because as a child it could n't have been easy to be the homely , unloved one of the family , with Virginia so pretty and sweet and lovable . And able to take so easily what Morgan wanted most . " This was a new and startling conception of Morgan which Lora found hard to accept . " Mrs. Channing homely ? " " Oh , not now . Not since she has learned poise and has gained a position in the world with Nicholas 's wealth behind her . As a woman she has come into her own . But as a strongwilled , disliked little girl , she had a hard time . Virginia and I were the only ones who really stood up for her and we were the wrong sex . She did n't care whether or not we liked her . Wade was the one she wanted and she was ready to fight for his admiration , even while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely little thing I had to feel sorry for her . " Lora could only listen in silence , finding it difficult to reconcile her recent glimpses of Morgan with the picture Serena remembered . " I 'll never forget something that happened on my fifteenth birthday , " Serena went on . " Let me see  --  Morgan would have been thirteen at the time . Wade and Adam are the same age ? a year younger than Morgan , and Virginia would have been eight or nine . " Serena left her sorting and came to pull another chair close to the fire .  | " This is as good a time as any to tell you about it , " she said , thrusting the bright lock of hair back under her cap and smoothing out her big white apron . " I need a rest and we can have this time to ourselves . Would you like a cup of coffee , Lora ? " Lora shook her head . " No , thank you . Please tell me the story . I 'm anxious to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things . " " My birthday falls in August , when it can be very hot here on the island . So mother gave me an outdoor party that year . Some of my older friends were there , of course , but by the time this incident occurred they 'd gone home , and only the neighbors were left , and a few grownups . Mama always invited the Ambrose children to our parties , even though Mrs. Tyler did n't approve of such social recognition . At any rate , the five of us were out in the side garden , quite replete from being stuffed with ice cream and cake and candy . Virginia was building a little house of twigs and stones and leaves , while Wade and I were helping her . She was such a good , amiable child that we all loved to please her . Adam was prowling around shooting Indians or something  --  he always had to be active  --  and Morgan was swinging in the hammock , looking cross because no one was paying much attention to her . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hume place near you . The house that burned down . " She sighed , remembering sadly . Lora watched the fire as she listened and as Serena 's quiet voice went on building pictures in her mind , she could almost see the children as they had been on that long-ago day in August . Virginia , small and fair-haired , with a dimple that was forever showing with her ready smile . Serena , older , tolerant and kind . Adam forever restless , ready for any scapegrace adventure . Wade pale because he did n't eat well and was often kept indoors , but always eager to be liked . And , finally , Morgan , with ragged , dark hair that would never stay within the confines of a braid or ribbon , her nose that was too big , and her stormy , dark eyes and sulky mouth .  | As she listened , Lora could almost hear the words of the careless women on the porch  --  adults , sure that the children were intent on their own affairs , not listening to grown-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests who had started the whole thing . She had looked at Morgan swinging sullenly in the hammock and had shaken her head at her friends . " What a pity the Ambrose girls are so different . The little one is quite charming and appealing . Even without a good family background she will probably do well in her own circles . But that older child is a fright . So bad-tempered . So plain . " " Hush , " said Mrs. Hume uneasily . " She may hear you . " The other woman shrugged . " Someone should take her in hand . She has been trying to spoil the party for the others all afternoon . " Mrs. Hume threw a quick look at the seemingly indifferent Morgan and took her friends into the house . Morgan waited exactly two minutes and then swung herself out of the hammock . She came over and stood glowering at the small house of twigs that Virginia was building . The other children had heard and they looked at her uncomfortably . " Do n't pay any attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old busybody . " Adam scalped his last Indian and joined the group , his eyes alight at the prospect of trouble . " Just the same , what she said was true . You have been trying to spoil things for us all afternoon , Morgan . " Wade was about to place a V-shaped twig upon the roof of the house when Morgan swung her foot and kicked the whole thing from beneath his hand . The bits flew in all directions and Virginia cried out in dismay . It was possible that Adam , who was no respecter of the feminine person , might have tackled Morgan then and there and given her a good pummeling , but the girl was too quick for hiin . She sprang away  | with a derisive laugh and climbed the iron fence that ran along the front of the house . " Get down , Morgan ! " Serena ordered in her role of the eldest . " If you fall on those spikes you 'll kill yourself . " But Morgan only balanced on the narrow ledge that ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and laughing at them all . " Maybe I 'm a fright , but I 'm braver than any of you ! " she cried . " I can walk this fence all the way to the gate , and I 'll bet the rest of you are scared to try . " " No one wants to try , " said Serena reasonably . " And we do n't want to see you hurt . " Virginia hid her face in her hands . " Make Morgan come down , " she quavered . " Fraidy-cats ! Fraidy-cats ! " cried Morgan , and started her reckless traversing of the fence , putting one foot almost carelessly before the other , down beside the spikes of the palings . Adam said , " Who 's afraid ? Anybody can walk that old fence . " He was after Morgan in a second and up behind her , moving with an easy , sure balance , completely confident and unafraid . Morgan reached the gatepost and jumped down , her dark face glowing with triumph . But she was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she chanted . Wade stood up , staring at Morgan angrily . Virginia caught his hand and clung to it , but he shook her off and went toward the fence . Adam had jumped down by now and even he did n't want to see Wade attempt the feat . " Hey ! " he called . " Do n't climb up there . You get dizzy too easy . " Serena knew she should run into the house for her mother , should scream , should do something , but she was suddenly helpless , frozen in dreadful fascination , as they all were , watching Wade climb the fence and stand white and shaky on its top , looking down at the spikes beneath him . One step after another he took , obviously frightened and  | fighting his own fear . Serena had begun to think he would make it after all when , three steps from the end , his vertigo won out . He swayed , tried to recover his balance , and put out a hand to save himself as he fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his palm , and then he was on the ground , his hand impaled on the fence . Serena recovered her power of voice and screamed wildly for her mother . Little Virginia went into sick hysterics at the sight of blood and Wade 's agonizing pain . It was Adam who tore down the lane shouting for Ambrose at the top of his lungs . Morgan , who had caused the whole thing , only stared in horror . There were no men at the party , only frightened women , and it was Ambrose who came running back with Adam to take charge of the crisis . It was he who removed Wade 's hand from the spike and caught the boy when he fainted . It was he who stanched the blood and carried his limp body back to his mother 's house . The birthday party broke up in confusion . No one spoke to Morgan . No one told the grownups just what had happened . It was Morgan herself who told her father . She went back to the Tylers ' and sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little sick himself . Virginia had been put to bed by her mother by that time in the servants ' quarters . But Morgan could not rest till she had told her father what had happened , had castigated and humbled herself . " Years afterwards Ambrose told me about it , " Serena said to Lora . " Morgan always had to do things in extremes . She asked him for a whipping , even pleaded for one . I suppose the poor thing felt she could expiate her guilt if she hurt herself enough . But Ambrose was n't the beating sort of father . " " She should have been whipped , " Lora cried indignantly . " What a wicked thing to do ! " " Children often do wicked things . " Serena 's tone was gentle . " But that does n't mean they are wicked . The punishment  | Ambrose gave her without intention was worse than any whipping . I believe her father has always been the one person whose love and admiration she really wanted as a child . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died shortly after Virginia was married . She always wanted her father 's respect . And she tried to gain it in the wrong ways , as children do so perversely sometimes . But Ambrose is simple and good and there 's no cruelty in him . He could never understand Morgan and her behavior must always have bewildered him , even while he wanted to help her . " " Did Wade 's mother know what really happened ? " Lora asked . " Gracious no ! I ca n't think what she 'd have done to Morgan . Wade never told her , and no one else dared . But I heard Mother Tyler use the accident against him one time when he was older . She said , Remember  --  if you put yourself on an iron fence , you 've got to be man enough not to fall off . ' " Lora shivered . " What a dreadful thing to say . " In her imagination she could see Wade , hurt in spirit as well as in his physical body . He must have felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact he 'd showed more courage than either Morgan or Adam , who lacked the imagination to be afraid in the first place , and so were in much less danger . " Afterwards , " Serena said , getting up to return to her sorting of towels , " Morgan could n't do enough for Wade , and of course everything she did was wrong . She had a genius as a child for alienating those she wanted to have like her . I really believe she was more sensitive than Virginia and I 'm sure she suffered deeply in the knowledge that her younger sister could always gain easily what she could never have . Only her suffering was all within herself and for herself . She never stepped into anyone else 's shoes to understand his feelings . So there it is , Lora . Not a very pretty story . " " It helps me to understand why Wade must dislike her , " Lora said . Serena shook her head . " That 's the strange part . He never seemed to hold what happened against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of fascination for him too . He blamed no one except himself for the accident . I do n't think he regretted getting up on that fence so foolishly . He only regretted falling , and he never blamed Morgan for that . No , this late avoidance of her has its roots in the more recent past . But I do n't really know what might have caused it . " Tenderness for Wade welled in Lora 's heart . She could see the picture more clearly now . Even though there were still gaps she could understand far better . She fell to watching the fire again . " He needed Virginia a great deal , did n't he ? " " Yes , " Serena said , slapping her hand at a frayed towel as if it offended her . " He needed her , of course . But I 'm not at all sure her way was good for him . " Lora looked un quickly . " Sometimes I 've thought that myself . And yet his mother 's way has n't been good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Either you love a person as he is and forgive him his faults , or you ca n't forgive those faults and you try to make him into something else . At least I can understand why he 's having such a hard time recovering from the accident of Virginia 's death . " Serena glanced at her uncertainly and then came to a decision . " There are some who say her death was not an accident . Perhaps that is something you ought to know . " Lora blinked in bewilderment . " You might as well know what has been rumored , though you need n't believe it . I 'm not sure that I do myself . But there have been whispers of suicide . " " Suicide ? But why ? Surely Virginia would n't . . . " " Wade admitted to some quarrel with her a week or so before her death  --  something he blamed himself for . That was strange because Virginia was never the sort to quarrel . However , there is Mrs. Tyler to consider . I suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps she succeeded beyond her hopes . " " But Mother Tyler has only praise for Virginia now , " Lora protested . " She keeps holding her up to me as a model wife . "  | Serena lost her tolerant attitude for the first time . " Of course ! She has to find some way to make you unhappy . Oh , but she makes me furious , that old woman ! I can be generous to Wade and even to Morgan  --  but I can only see blame as far as Mrs. Tyler is concerned . She would go to any lengths to gain her own ends . Why do you suppose Wade and Virginia had separate rooms in that house ? His mother took care of that . Anything to keep them apart . She told Virginia that Wade did n't sleep well at night , that he had never been strong . Separate bedrooms were a necessity . Since Virginia was never one to stand up to her , any more than Wade could stand up to her , that was the way it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the premises and she lacked Morgan 's strongheaded ways . But we 've talked of unhappy things long enough , Lora . I 've just tried to give you the glimpse of the past that you asked for . The present is something else . The present is you , my dear , And , frankly , I think you 're the very best thing that has ever happened to Wade . Much better for him than Virginia . " Lora could only shake her head despairingly . She was not in the least sure of this herself . The doorbell startled them with its ring and Serena 's brow puckered . " Oh , dear , someone to spoil our visit , I 'm afraid . " A moment later Adam came knocking on the door to ask if their woman-talk was over , as a matter of great importance had arisen . He ushered in Hester Wylie , the young woman whom Lora had met the night of Serena 's party . She greeted them both gaily and plunged at once into the purpose of her errand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two and wanted Serena 's help . Adam had already promised to escort his sister , and of course Wade and Lora Tyler must come too . " We must get Wade back into the middle of things , " Hester said to Lora . " I 'm sure neither of you is having fun stuck in that dark old house . "  | " And , after all , " said Adam , " we must have our fun . " Hester made a face at him , undaunted . " We 're not forgetting the war , you know . We 're planning this especially for some officers who are home on leave , and for a certain exprisoner of war named Adam . I wish Edgar could be here , too , Serena dear . " " So do I , " said Serena , and Lora thought guiltily that she had been so concerned with her own affairs that she had not even asked about Edgar . How much Serena would miss him , and how courageously she concealed it . Before Lora went home that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorsed and abetted by Serena , and Lora had been drawn into an agreement to persuade Wade to come . When she broached the matter to him that evening in the library , she found that such persuasion was not too difficult . The Christmas party had given him a taste of the social life he had once indulged in so heartily and this affair promised a few hours ' release from the gloomy atmosphere of the house . He had led a difficult day at the beck and call of his mother , and Lora could read the discouragement in his eyes . Her mood of tenderness , aroused by Serena 's story , held and she reached for his left hand where it lay idly on the sofa between them . She took it into her own , tracing the white welts of the old scar on its back . " Serena told me how this happened , " she said softly . " She gave me the whole story of that day . " " Serena is a gossip . " Wade would have drawn his hand away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was not gossip . I want to know all about you . I want to know things that happened when you were young . You were a brave little boy to walk the fence that day . " " . T was n't in the least brave . Morgan was right  --  I was a coward about that fence . " " But you climbed it , " Lora persisted . " You went ahead in spite of being afraid  --  that 's what really makes bravery . " " A man is judged by his successes , not his failures , " Wade  | said . " But this is something I no longer want to think about or discuss . " She could sense his withdrawal , but she had so few opportunities to talk to him alone that she held to her purpose . " Everyone likes you , Wade . Jemmy wants so much to love you . He needs to love you . But you hold everyone off while you convince yourself that you are  --  well , somehow unworthy . Do you do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you ? " " I have always disappointed her , if that 's what you mean . " There was a warning in his voice which would have discouraged her if she had been less intent on her own designs . But this was her chance to launch into the subject which Morgan had brought up with her . " Your mother is n't the world . There are others who believe in your talents , others who need your help . " He watched her , his guard still up . " What lies behind all this maneuvering , Lora ? " " I 'm not being very clever about it , am I ? " she admitted . " Very well  --  I ' 11 tell you straight out . Two weeks ago Mrs. Channing invited me up to her house for tea . " She could sense his stiffening . " You declined , I trust ? " " No  --  I accepted . I saw no reason for declining . I do n't want to carry on old feuds . The matter Mrs. Channing wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any small feud . " He rose impatiently to replenish the fire . " Have I not enough worries at this time , Lora ? Must you add to them by striking up a ridiculous friendship with this woman who has done nothing but injure me ? " " This is scarcely a friendship , " Lora said . " I believe you are as interested as I am in any plan which might lead to a halting of this dreadful war . " " And what has Morgan Channing to do with such plans ? " he asked over his shoulder , prodding the fire with impatient thrusts of the poker . " Why should she even care ? " " I 'm not sure why . " At least , Lora thought , she had caught  | his interest , and she went on quickly . " Perhaps she likes the sense of power she gains from mixing into politics . Perhaps she 's in love with this Murray Norwood and is interested for his sake . I do n't know . It might even be that she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost to her altogether if the war goes on . Is that possible ? " Wade set the fire screen in place and wiped his hands on a linen handkerchief . " It seems quite likely . Nicholas left her considerable property in the South and if I know Morgan she would dare anything to cling to her wealth . But is so selfish a motive any reason why we should trust her ? " " Do n't you see , Wade ? " Lora leaned toward him earnestly . " It does n't matter if her motives are selfish , providing they are sincere . There are very definite plans afoot which this Mr. Norwood is mixed into . Mrs. Channing says even Governor Seymour approves of them and will be behind them unofficially . " " And where do I fit into this little fantasy ? " " Mr. Norwood needs you . He needs men here on the island who are liked and have some influence . There are ways in which you could help . " " Influence  --  I ? " His laughter was unbelieving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more if you decide against it . Let Morgan know when you would be available for a meeting with him at her house . " In the silence of the room the distant , insistent ringing of a small silver bell reached them . " I 'll have to see what she wants , " Wade said wearily . " Ellie has probably gone to bed by now . " Lora put a quick hand on , his arm . " First , tell me , Wade ? you will see Mr. Norwood ? Perhaps there 's nothing to all this , but if you 'll just talk to him ? " " With Morgan behind him , and in her house ? " Wade asked . " Indeed I will not . I 'll have nothing to do with the matter , or with either of them . " And he went off to answer the summons of his mother 's bell . Lora leaned her head against the sofa and toasted her  | feet before the fire . At least she had made a first attempt . Since her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to draw Wade from his retreat into himself and into the past . He needed to be coaxed out of this house , given a chance to put his hands to some work that he could feel was important and worth while . Something that would make him look outside himself . It occurred to her that there was another step which might be managed in connection with the sleighing party . She would ask Serena about it tomorrow . Her thoughts turned again to her visit with Serena that morning and the rumor that Virginia had taken her own life . Was there something more here which Wade and his mother had not published to the world ? Did Wade himself believe this ? If he did , how much greater his suffering must be than she had suspected .  | FEBRUARY turned obligingly snowy and by the time set for the sleighing party the roads were packed with frosting . All the island sparkled beneath the sun or shone in gleaming purity under the moon . Now the bare branches of the trees made a fragile tracery against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening was frosty and clear , and cold stars hung like bits of ice in the dark sky . There was much champing of bits and the stamping of horses ' hooves as the Lords ' sleigh waited in the lane for its load . Bells arched above the harness and chimed musically at every move the horses made . Two other sleighs were to join them farther down the hill and by the time the party was on its way there would be some forty young people and married couples in the group . Lora wore the plainest of her new dresses  --  a gown of darkblue wool , but without hoops , of course  --  and she and Wade were well bundled into coats , with wool mufflers around their heads and ears , and warm mittens protecting their hands . All seats except the driver 's had been removed from the big sleigh and the body filled with fresh , clean straw . As Lora and Wade reached the Lord house , they found Adam and some of the other men carrying out hot bricks , well wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoors until all was ready , but Adam barred Lora 's way , laughing down at her when she would have mounted the steps . " Hello , Lora . Hello , Wade . No , you do n't  --  no scooting inside ! All you fragile little ladies can come out now and pile aboard . Somebody 's got to keep these bricks warm . "  | Adam had a striped stocking cap , which probably belonged to Eddie , pulled well over his ears , and a red plaid muffler wound twice about his neck . His nose was pink with the cold and his eyes very bright . He looked , Lora reflected , like a boy who had been let suddenly out of school and was intent on action and mischief . There was about him somehow a quality both irritating and engaging . The ladies came hurrying out the door , bundled to their ears , twittering and laughing , and even those men who were in uniform were released and gay for the evening . One after another the ladies were helped into the sleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before Lora found a place she stood for a moment looking out upon the drive , watching the open door from which light spilled brightly as guests ran down the steps . She was searching for two faces in particular , and she did not see them . Serena , puffing a little as her brother helped her unceremoniously into the sleigh , caught her searching look . " It 's all right , " she whispered . " We 're picking them up at the ferry landing . Mr. Norwood had to make a trip over to town and Morgan went to meet his boat . I do n't know why you 're anxious to effect a reconciliation between Morgan and Wade , but I 've done what you asked . She and Mr. Norwood are joining us . " Lora settled down in the straw , pulling a hot brick toward her feet , and a few moments later they had all piled in . She was not sure how it happened , but the married partners seemed to have separated for the trip out . Wade was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , while Adam Hume managed to take the place next to Lora . She was not entirely pleased at his company , but managed a polite smile . " Good , " he whispered under the racket the others were making . " I 'm glad to see the corners of your mouth turn up for a change . You 've been worrying too much lately . " She had no answer to that . Her worries were none of Adam 's affair and she doubted that he would understand  | them . From time to time she was aware of his eyes upon her , without mockery now , and she could not be sure what he was thinking . The driver cracked his whip and the four horses put their weight into the pull . The idle jingle of sleigh bells took on a steady and musical rhythm to the trot of the horses . Beneath the runners snow squeaked and crunched and a cold wind whipped into their faces . Lora found herself snug and comfortable beneath the buffalo robe , with a brick hot at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new experience , paying little attention to the silent man beside her . There were starts and stops as other sleighs joined the party , and from the shelter at the ferry landing Morgan and Murray came hurrying to take their places in the Lords ' sleigh . In spite of herself , Lora found her attention fixed on Wade as Morgan approached . She had to lean forward just a little to see his face and she was aware that Adam drew back at her side to give her a better view . Once more she saw the darkening surge of color beneath Wade 's fair skin , saw how quickly he turned to speak to Hester as if he had not seen Morgan at all . Unbidden , Serena 's words came to mind . Serena had said Wade was afraid of Morgan . Why ? For what reason , unless perhaps that he distrusted himself where she was concerned ? But that was something Lora did not want to believe . Wade had truly loved Virginia . There was never any doubt about that . Morgan , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the other women . She wore a long fur cape and carried a muff with a bunch of artificial violets pinned to it . A crocheted scarf wound her head more decoratively than the clumsy caps and mufflers of the other women and her eyes were ashine with some inner excitement . As she got into the sleigh she threw Wade no more than a careless glance and greeted him as casually as the others . Settling into the straw beside Adam , she turned a single questioning look upon Lora . Murray Norwood had been on business in the city and had  | made no concessions in the way of dress . He was obliging but not exactly bubbling with gaiety as he folded his long legs beneath him next to Serena . By way of complete incongruity he wore a top hat , and Hester began to tease him about it . " What a target for snowballs ! " she cried . " You 'll bring an attack upon us sure as anything ! " He gave her a slightly chill smile and pulled the buffalo robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . Murray Norwood fitted a drawing room far better than he did a strawfilled sleigh . It was probably a tribute to the spell Morgan had cast upon him that he was here at all . Now the line of sleighs was mounting Richmond Turnpike , climbing the long hill toward Silver Lake . A fine misting of snow had begun again and the stars were veiled . Someone started a rollicking tune , and soon they were all singing . " Jingle Bells , " of course , and other sleighing songs . Then the beautiful , but always mournful " Lorena , " which had become popular with the soldiers of North and South alike . There were the inevitable war tunes , too : " Tenting Tonight " and the stirring words which Julia Ward Howe had set to the tune of the John Brown song , " The Battle Hymn of the Republic . " Perhaps it was the latter which started the war talk . Lora had wanted for a little while to be like the other women and forget everything but this beautiful night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they unfolded about the sleigh . There were woods on every hand now , with only an occasional sign of habitation . A string of small lakes shone in the starlight , with the dark form of a mill at the far end . But the talk drew her back to unhappy reality . It was gloomy , discouraged talk . Grant had been repulsed at Vicksburg and the pattern of defeat and inaction went on . " The draft must come soon , " one captain in blue was saying . " We need men desperately . After our losses at Fredericksburg , we must draft or enlist . And enlistments have fallen off alarmingly . " Where other ladies might feel it wise to keep silent when  | their men talked of such matters , Morgan never hesitated to speak her mind . " What if there is no draft ? " she asked . " I 've heard that Governor Seymour does n't approve of such coercive measures . " " If there 's no draft the South will beat us , " said Adam . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps if we offer to cease hostilities , we can make terms with the South even now . I doubt that the Southern states can be eager to continue the fighting . " " Then you do n't know the South , " Adam said . " Why should she stop when she 's got us practically on the run ? " There was a murmur of indignation and denial , and several men began to talk at once . Lora found herself watching Morgan as she listened . The sleigh had turned down the Clove Road and was nearing a section where gaslight illumined the streets again . In the cool , greenish glare Morgan 's eyes were alert and watchful , her wide mouth curved in a faint smile . Lora could not forget the picture Serena had painted in her mind of a young girl with wild hair , a nose too big for her face , and angry eyes that defied a disapproving world . Was that girl still there , hidden beneath the polished exterior of this confident and handsome woman ? Tongues were turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of the draft by the time the sleighs reached the Shore Road and the lights of the Pavilion Hotel came into view ahead . The ladies sighed with relief , glad enough to have attention come back to them , eager to put all thought of war aside for one gay night at least . Wade had taken no active part in the debate over the draft , but Lora had noted that he listened to every word and seemed to be turning the matter over in his mind . She wondered if Mr. Norwood might not succeed if he approached Wade while he was in this thoughtful mood . She stood up with the others , brushing herself free of snow , glad to leave her slightly cramped position and return to warmth and light . In her preoccupation she might have  | forgotten Adam had he not been there , ready to lift her down from the sleigh . Wade had gone ahead with Hester , escorting her into the hotel  --  which was proper enough , since each man must look after his partner . But Lora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercies . As they went toward the lighted doorway , he spoke softly in her ear . " If you keep trying to run away from me , I shall get the idea that you 're afraid of me . Are you ? " She glanced up at him in annoyance . " Why should I be ? As a matter of fact , I was n't even thinking about you . " He laughed and bent toward her . " Sometimes you tempt me just a little . What if I should try to make you think of me ? " She did not trouble to answer that as they went up the steps together . This was merely Adam 's reckless way of playing with danger , and she meant to give it no thought . There were more important matters demanding her attention tonight . When the ladies had put aside their bulky wraps and emerged in hoopless gowns to rejoin the men , she was glad to see that partners were again coupled with original partners . Other sleighing parties around the island had come for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whirling figures . Morgan , Lora noted , wore no warm wool dress of modest color like the others , but was brilliant tonight in emerald green , her shoulders bare and lovely . It did not seem to matter to her that her costume did not suit the occasion . She seemed to scorn convention and do as she pleased . Wade , still hampered by his crutch , and in some discomfort after the cramping restrictions of the sleigh , seemed nevertheless in vastly good humor . It must have been a relief to escape from his mother 's tempers for an evening . He would not hear of it that Lora should sit beside him this time throughout the dancing , and when Adam came to seek her as a partner , Wade insisted that she dance . At least she was grateful for the fact that a figure dance  | was forming . Adam would have to keep his wits about him and watch his steps . The audacity of his remark about making her think of him stung more in retrospect than at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reprove any further boldness . She drew herself as tall as her slight height permitted and looked coolly away from the laughter in his eyes . Tonight , though some of the same people were present , the atmosphere was very different from that of Serena 's party . The crowd was more boisterous , thanks perhaps to the rougher clothes and the more informal atmosphere lent by the sleigh ride . Adam swung Lora breathlessly through the figures of the dance and when the music changed to a waltz after the more active number , he drew her into his arms without asking for the privilege . She looked up at him , ready to utter some sharp reproof , but he returned her look with such unexpected and penetrating kindness that she faltered and held back the words . " Just this one waltz and then I 'll let you go , " he said . " Smile , Lora . Turn up the corners of your mouth . Forget the things that trouble you . " She did not feel like smiling , but she let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost herself almost sadly to the music . He did not speak until the dance was over and he was taking her back across the room toward Wade . " I see your husband is having an interesting conversation , " he said . She saw what he meant . Wade was not alone in the line of small gilt chairs . Murray Norwood sat next to him and the two were absorbed in conversation . The two men rose as she approached and made a place for her between them . Adam bowed his thanks formally for the dance , looked straight into her eyes for an instant , and then disappeared into the crowd . Mr. Norwood seemed not to mind her listening presence , and went on with what he had been saying . He was talking about the draft and about the one thing which might halt hostilities  --  a stopping of the draft before it got under way .  | Wade asked the same question Lora had . " But how can any group set itself against the government to prevent the draft ? That in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Norwood said smoothly , " and not at all what is intended . " Wade was doubtful . " The government would back its order with force , naturally . Police , even the army . " " The government is not going to shoot down loyal citizens . And we would still be that . " Norwood went on quickly when Wade made a little gesture of rejection . " This is not the place or time to give you the details , Mr. Tyler . There is strong organization behind this move . If sufficient opposition is raised to the draft throughout the North the government will be helpless to enforce it . The voter 's voice still counts . I ask only that you attend one of our meetings . We can not of course admit you to the inner circle unless you decide to join us , but through the kindness of Mrs. Channing it is possible that an arrangement be made so that you can learn something of our cause . " Wade 's interest was evident , and this time he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As she listened , Lora glanced about the room , looking for Morgan , and saw her dancing with Herbert Wylie  --  perhaps purposely giving Murray Norwood his opportunity with Wade . " I still do n't see what use I might be in this cause , " Wade said doubtfully . Mr. Norwood reached into his pocket and drew out a small brown object which he tossed idly in his hand . " Every man we can raise is needed . But in particular we need men of intelligence and influence . " " Influence ? " Wade 's laugh had a wry sound . " Influence indeed . Mrs. Channing has told me of the time when the young bloods of the island followed your lead with some enthusiasm . " " In matters of getting up parties , perhaps . The war has sobered young blood . "  | Mr. Norwood opened his hand , revealing the object which lay upon the palm . " Do you know what this is ? " " A nut or acorn of some sort , I presume . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Norwood said . He held it toward Lora . " What does the pattern resemble , Mrs. Tyler ? " She looked at it for a moment . " Why , it 's a little like two hearts intertwined . " " Exactly . That is why the butternut is worn as a badge of honor out in Ohio where the movement is many thousands strong . Those intertwined hearts stand for the common people of the North and South , together as brothers . Not separated by a rich man 's war , or by emotional nonsense concerning the slaves . " Lora glanced at Wade , not altogether trusting Murray Norwood 's smooth manner and persuasive words . Yet  --  any movement to stop the war , even if one were not altogether in agreement with the ideas of the leaders , seemed worth considering . Wade , too , seemed to be weighing the matter , still not convinced . Mr. Norwood returned the butternut to his pocket . " Now is our time . The movement is already strong in the West , but only beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick of war . The fight has gone out of our men . They are deserting in huge numbers every day . Confidence in our leadership is shaken . The papers scream alarming details of what the North has not accomplished . People are ready to accept peace on any terms . This is the time to act . If we can prevent or stop the draft , the war will be over . It must be over . " There was an intensity about the man which was compelling . The bright room , the sound of music and laughter faded into mere background before the fire of his sincerity . Wade nodded thoughtfully . " I will at least come to your meeting , sir . If you will permit me , I will come and listen , but I will promise nothing more . " As the last measure of the music died , Lora saw Herbert Wylie bringing Morgan toward them across the floor . The  | party was moving into an adjoining room for supper now , and Lora rose with the two men . Wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to him . " I hope you are coming in with us , Wade , " she said . Wade bowed gravely but made no promise . Morgan took Mr. Norwood 's arm and they moved in the direction of the adjacent dining room . At the table Wade found places for himself and Lora which were nowhere near Murray and Morgan . But now Wade was less quiet than on the trip out in the sleigh . She could sense again his winning charm , see why there must have been a time when he could easily draw men and women about him . Perhaps this talent had been some compensation for his mother 's lack of belief in him at home . Waiters brought steaming-hot oyster stew and the sleighing party ate with appetite and relish . There was no war talk now , but only a somewhat feverish effort to snatch at this moment of being together in this bright room where the distant roll of drums could not reach them . Lora , however , found herself growing more quiet as the gaiety about her increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sober , eating stolidly as if his only interest were in the food set before him . Once his eyes met Lora 's and she was aware that he had noted her area of quiet , and in a sense saluted it across the table . He was no longer asking her to laugh . After the late and leisurely supper they all piled into sleighs again and went jangling off along the Shore Road , following the water 's edge toward home , instead of cutting back across the island . This time Lora stayed close to Wade . He seemed glad to have her there within the curve of his arm as they nestled into straw that was once more warmed with hot bricks supplied by the hotel . She was comfortably weary now , dreamily aware that the night had cleared and a big moon which had risen overhead was silvering the dark waters of the Kill Van Kull . A few lights sparkled on the jersey shore , and there was the sequin  | brightness of vessels and small craft anchored out in the Kill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleigh bells sounded elfin in the night . " Comfortable , Lora ? " Wade whispered , and she nodded her head against his shoulder . It was comforting to let all disturbing matters fade away and pretend again for a little while . Pretend that she was married to someone she loved and who loved her dearly . Not Martin . She quickly shut away the thought of the past and moved closer to Wade . She was growing drowsy now . Wade 's arm was around her and for a little while she could feel safe and protected . A make-believe safety , yet she held to the warm , comforting feeling of it as she dozed . Once , when the sleigh jolted over a rutted place where the snow had been worn through at a crossing , her eyes flew open and in the brief interval of light from a lamp she saw that Adam , next to Serena on the other side of the sleigh , was watching her . She closed her eyes quickly , refusing to rise to any challenge in his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing , no one . Only his own bitter self to live with . She snuggled more closely into the curve of Wade 's arm . When the road grew dark she felt the touch of her husband 's cheek against her own and was comforted .  | MARCH BLEW IN tempestuously , melting the snow on tree branch and hillside , reducing Staten Island roads to a sea of mud . The Richmond County Gazette printed the usual indignant letters of protest from readers who felt that the paving of roads was a necessity which should be postponed no longer . In a corner of the Tyler yard the willow tree leaned with the wind , its tracery of branches streaming outward like a woman 's long hair . Wind moaned down chimneys and whistled at every crack of window or door to which it could put its blustery mouth . On such a day it wa , s good to remain inside snug and warm by a fire . As far as Mother Tyler was concerned , the status quo within the house had remained exactly that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have anyone but Wade , Peter , or Ellie come near her , and had occasional relapses over the presence of the growing puppy . She read nothing but her Bible and she quoted her Lord 's words often to Wade , giving them her own stern interpretation of criticism upon this household . Lora had been only too glad to accept banishment , though at times it made matters difficult for the rest of the house . At least there had been some escape for Wade , since the night of the sleighing party . He had attended a meeting of the Circle at Morgan Channing 's house , and while he had been thoughtful and guarded about what had happened , Lora saw that his interest had been fired . Early in March , when a mass meeting was held  | in New York with Clement Vallandigham as the speaker , Wade went across with Murray Norwood and Morgan . Lora would have liked to go herself , if only for the sake of some activity and excitement , but Wade said firmly that these were a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . Like Virginia , she thought rebelliously . But she would in no way disturb this new interest which sparked his life . She suspected that he did not tell his mother what he did , or where he went , and this must have added one more burr of irritation to the old woman 's bed of self-inflicted pain . Wade had come home from the New York meeting talking familiarly of " Val , " apparently caught by the electric quality of this erstwhile congressman from Ohio . Vallandigham had not won re-election last fall , but he was still a leader among the Peace Democrats and there were those who whispered that he was also a leader among the Knights of the Golden Circle  --  in fact , that the two bore a close relationship . It was enough for Lora that Wade had come to life and seized upon a mission which kept him at least occupied , if not entirely happy . Lora had come into the dining room this afternoon to complete some unfinished business . Wade was out on an errand of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would perform her nefarious deed and surprise the two of them tonight at dinner . What she would like , she thought , was to pull every shred of dreary red wallpaper off the walls of this room and start afresh . But she knew she had better approach her reformations with a less revolutionary attitude . Even a small advance at a time would do . From its position of honor above the sideboard , the game bird hung its limp neck over a painted table , glaring at her with one dead eye . She nodded to it cheerfully . " You 've made us uncomfortable long enough . Down you shall come . And I 'll find something cheerful to put in your place if I have to paint it myself . "  | Ellie leaned a shoulder against the dining-room door to push it open and stuck in her head . " You call me , ma'am ? I thought I heard somebody talking . " Her hands were covered with flour and dough from bread-making and she held one under the other to keep from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you heard , Ellie , " Lora said . " I was talking to his nibs up there . " She gestured toward the picture on the wall . Ellie 's eyes widened and Lora laughed softly . It was better never to laugh out loud in this house , since that would set the silver bell across the hall to ringing . " Do n't worry , " she said . " It 's all right as long as I talk to a picture on the wall . It 's when I start talking to myself that you need to be concerned . " Ellie 's sense of humor was not outstanding , but since she presumed this to be some sort of joke , she cracked her thin mouth into the semblance of a smile . Just then Mrs. Tyler 's bell rang piercingly . The long winter days had somehow made its silver note grow sharper , less musical with constant use . " Oh , Lor ' , ma'am ! " Ellie wailed . Lately even her own devotion to Mrs. Tyler had worn a little thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and there she goes wanting me . " " You go back to your bread , " Lora said . " I 'll see what she wants . " " Better not , " said Ellie , making futile wiping motions with her sticky hands . " There 's a divil in her these days  --  pardoning the word , ma'am . Goodness knows what she 'll do if you go in there . " " Nevertheless , I am going , " said Lora , suddenly determined . " You just finish your bread . " The bell rang again insistently and Lora crossed the hall and opened the door which had been forbidden to her ever since Christmas . A fire burned low in the sitting-room grate , lending some slight warmth to the bedroom beyond , and the air was stuffy with sickroom odors . The sitting room looked unlived in  | without the familiar figure in black in the chair before the fire . Jason Cowles 's visage brooded from the wall more grimly than ever . " Why must you take so long when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pettish tones from the dim bedroom . Lora went quietly to the door . " Ellie 's hands are covered with dough , Mother , so I 've come to see if I can help . " The old woman was a hulk beneath the mound of quilts and in the dim light from a shuttered window Lora could just see her eyes , dark and shadowed in a white face , staring at her balefully . " I will not have you in this room , " Mrs. Tyler quavered . " Where is my son ? I have given orders ? " Lora went straight to the bed and stood beside it . " There 's no one else home just now . Shall I get you some water ? Or your medicine ? " Tears of weak rage blurred Mrs. Tyler 's eyes . " I will not be mocked when I am ill . It is not good for me to be so upset . Go away and send Ellie to me at once . I  --  I 'm so miserably uncomfortable . " Lora ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt beneath the bedclothes with a practiced hand . " Of course you 're uncomfortable with everything bunched into a wad of wrinkles . I 'll have you easy again in a jiffy . " She returned to the sitting room with no heed for the sputter of protest which followed her and came back wheeling the big leather chair before her . Then she went to the bed , released the covers gently from the clutch of Mrs. Tyler 's fingers , and flung them to the end of the bed . The old woman lay shivering in her flannel nightgown , gasping at the violation . " Now then , " Lora said , " let 's move fast so that you wo n't get chilled . " She reached for the thin hands , ringless now , and pulled the old woman to a sitting position . " I 'm too weak for this ! " Mrs. Tyler wailed . " Go away , you wicked girl ! "  | " Of course you 're weak , lying in bed all this long time . But never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you 've felt in a long while . Come now  --  over to the chair . " " I 'm going to faint ! " cried Mrs. Tyler . " That 's all right , " said Lora . " I know just what to do for a faint . Quickly now  --  I wo n't let you fall . " She gave all her support to Mrs. Tyler 's dead weight , half carrying her the few steps to the chair . Then she lowered her into it , quickly wrapped a quilt about her , tucked it around her bare feet , and turned her attention to remaking the bed . The old lady did not faint , but she watched her tormentor with eyes bright with helpless rage . When the sheets had been pulled taut and every wrinkle banished , Lora turned cheerfully back to her charge . " I know how much you 'd like to punish me , but you ca n't punish anyone when you let yourself go to pieces like this . If you want things your way you have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed , and I 'm going to give you the best back rub you 've ever had . Fainting wo n't do you a bit of good . " There was alcohol among bottles and jars on a shelf and Lora turned the old woman quickly over on her stomach , pulled the covers up to her waist and pushed up her nightgown so that her thin back lay bare . If there was one thing Doc had taught her how to do well , it was to give a back rub to a bedridden patient . She went vigorously to work , rubbing and kneading with palms and strong fingers , seeking out nerve centers , relaxing knotted muscles . The stiffness went gradually out of her patient , gradually the old woman relaxed and resisted Lora 's hands no longer . " You 're going to feel wonderful now , " Lora said . " You 're even going to stop being indignant with me for helping you . " When she had completed her ministrations and had her patient covered and warm again , she hurried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the alarmed Ellie , and returned to wash Mrs. Tyler 's face and hands and comb her thin , snarled hair . Through it all , the old woman lay with  | her eyes tightly closed , weak , helpless , with her impotent anger fading in spite of herself . " Gracious , " said Lora , drying Mrs. Tyler 's fingers , " you do n't even take care of your hands any more . Do you know , your hands were the first thing I noticed about you ? They made me so ashamed of mine . Where 's that rose water and glycerine ? " She found the bottle and made a ceremony of rubbing the lotion into drying skin and roughened knuckles . " Now for your rings . They 're in this case on the table , are n't they ? We 'll have you all dressed up by the time Wade comes home . What a lovely diamond this is . I used to watch it shine in the firelight when you moved your hands . But nothing shines in this dark room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air to breathe . " " Fresh air is dangerous when one is in a weakened condition , " Mrs. Tyler protested . Lora went to the window . " My father did n't hold with that idea , " she said as she opened the shutters . The March wind seized the unexpected opportunity and whooshed into the room , setting window curtains flying and book pages fluttering . Lora permitted it to play havoc for no more than a minute , and then slammed down the window right in its face . But she left the shutters open and arrows of sunlight did swift battle with the room 's dark corners , lancing cheerfully from polished wood , warming bright quilt squares to life . Mrs. Tyler drew a deep lungful of cold fresh air and shuddered through her entire being . " Now what do you plan , may I ask ? " she demanded fiercely of her tormentor . Lora laughed out loud . " There ! I knew I 'd have you feeling better . You sound practically like yourself . Would you like to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your Bible on the table and I 'll fix the lamp for you . You may have your bell back now and I 'll return to my own work . " " Work ? " Mrs. Tyler echoed . " What work ? "  | Lora paused in the bedroom door . " Right now I 'm taking that dreadful picture of a dead bird off the dining-room wall . I 'm sure it is giving us all indigestion . " Mrs. Tyler pulled herself up in bed . " I will not have that picture touched ! Do you hear me ? That painting ? " Lora put her hands saucily on her hips . " How can you stop me if you stay tied to your bed ? " She whirled out of the room and returned to her task , tingling from the encounter . She set a newspaper on a chair and climbed up to take the picture from the wall . She was holding the thing in her hands when Jemmy came running in , just home from school . Usually he went straight through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home in the stable . But when he saw the dining-room door . ajar and Lora balancing on a chair with the picture in her hands , he came in to find out what she was doing . " Hello , Jemmy . " Lora held up the picture for him to see . " This is not going to stare at us any more while we 're eating , " she told him . His eyes widened . " What will Grandmother say ? " " She has already said it . Oh , dear  --  there 's a dark blotch on the wall where the picture has hung for so long . We 'll have to find something right away to cover it . Have you any ideas , Jemmy ? " " We could take a picture from somewhere else , " he suggested . " Maybe the one of the Parthenon from the library . But then I suppose that would leave a spot on the wall there . Or that Three Graces one from my room . I 'm awfully tired of that . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old stuff in the attic . Pictures , too , I think . We could go up there and find something . " Lora handed him the picture and got down from the chair . " Fine  --  if you 'll help me . Do you want to go tell Hamlin you 're home first ? " He ran out to the yard and was back again while Lora was getting a shawl from her room . Jemmy showed her a door in the upper hall that opened onto ladder steps and she  | brought a candle to light their way . He went first to push up the trap door and climbed ahead into darkness . " Ooh , it 's shivery up here ! " he cried . " Hurry , Lora , bring up the candle . " She climbed to the top of the ladder , kicking back her skirts lest she trip , and set the candleholder on the door . Then she climbed the last steps into attic space . The roof pitched upward in dark beams above them , and Jemmy 's shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around were gathered the collections of generations past . Trunks and boxes , pieces of broken furniture , piles of discarded books . It was an orderly array , however , as was to be expected in Amanda Tyler 's house . On a wall rack were set several guns and some pistols and Jemmy regarded them with interest . " My grandfather  --  Papa 's father  --  used to go hunting quite often . Those are his guns . They used to keep the ammunition up here too , but once I tried to load a pistol and after that Papa hid every bit of it . Of course I 'm older now and I know I 'm not supposed to touch guns , though Adam lets me sometimes . " He found the pictures stacked with their faces against the wall . While Lora brought her candle over and heed it close , Jemmy acted as showman , turning frame after frame out from the wall . There was a grim print of the stabbing scene from Hamlet , and a fiercesome one of Lady Macbeth sleep-walking . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no better than the bird for a dining-room decoration . There was a still life of fruit which might have been more suitable , except that the painted articles bore little resemblance to reality . " Morgan Le Fay painted that , " said Jemmy . " I guess she used to paint quite a lot when she was a young girl . I can remember a much better one than this . " He turned another half-dozen candidates around and then brought out a garden scene , with a stiff little girl in flounced skirts daintily sniffing a spray of lilac .  | " There ! This is the one Aunt Morgan did when she was older . That 's my mother in the garden . Mama liked it . She used to have it hanging in the downstairs hall . Let 's put this one up , Lorie . " Lora regarded the picture with some doubt . True , it was bright and gay , and if the hand which painted it had been less than expert , it was still preferable to the picture of dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of Virginia , even when it so little resembled Virginia , where they must all look at it every day . Especially since that picture had been painted by her sister Morgan . But how was she to explain the matter diplomatically to Jemmy ? She held the candle high , playing for time , and its flame wavered and guttered as wind buffeted the house , wailing gustily through attic cracks . " We do n't have to decide now , anyway , Jemmy . I 'm getting cold up here . If the space goes empty for a while it wo n't really matter . Perhaps you can go to New York with me soon and then we 'll find something together that will be just right . " Jemmy shook his head . " I think this one 's fine . Lorie , when it 's warmer do you suppose we could come up here and look in some of the trunks ? Just for fun . " " I do n't see why not . We 'll ask your father if we may . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lugging it toward the stairs , however . " I like this one . Let 's go down , Lorie . It is cold . " She started after him uncertainly , wishing now that she had never tampered with the picture until she had another ready to take its place . " Of course your mother liked the picture , because Morgan was her sister . But we ca n't expect your father to like it as much when it is n't a very good painting . You know how he  --  well , he does n't exactly approve of your Aunt Morgan . " " Oh , yes he does , " Jemmy said , resting the frame on the floor near the trap door . " He likes her a lot , really . Else why would he be kissing her the way he did that day in the woods ? Bring your candle for the stairs , Lorie. "  | She followed him , stricken . This was just the talk of a small boy . Jemmy had a vivid imagination at times and did n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the question that came to her tongue . " When did this happen , Jemmy ? How long ago ? " He answered her guilelessly . " Oh , it was way last year ? no , before that . Before my mother ? " He broke off and started down the steep flight ahead of her , still carrying the picture . She went after him , blowing out the candle as she reached the bottom step , and closed the door carefully behind her . She kept her voice steady , casual , as she asked the next question . " Can you remember , Jemmy , whether you ever told anyone about this ? " " I told my mother , " Jemmy said , his interest still on the painting . " Lorie , I like this picture . If you do n't think it 's right for the dining room , could I have it in my room , please ? Could that old Three Graces one go down in the dining room for now ? " " A very good idea , " Lora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They went into his room to remove ' the old picture and hang Morgan 's water color in its place . All the while Lora kept a careful guard on her thoughts , her expression , her words . Not for a moment must Jemmy suspect the turmoil within her . When Jemmy sat down on his bed to admire the painting in its new place , Lora , carrying out the one he disliked , paused in the doorway . " Did your mother say anything special when you told her ? " " Anything about what ? " asked Jemmy blankly . " Oh  --  you mean about Papa and Morgan Le Fay in the woods ? She just said she was glad Papa liked Aunt Morgan . The hollyhocks in the picture are especially nice , do n't you think ? Do you like hollyhocks , Lorie ? " " I love them , " said Lora , and carried the Three Graces down to the dining room .  | Jemmy did not come with her this time and she climbed upon the chair , held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't quite right , but it would do for now . She slid the wire over the hook until it was exactly balanced . Then she stepped down from the chair and stood off to study the three rather buxom Graces without really seeing them at all . It was as if she feared that the moment she stopped working actively at something , stopped pretending to be busy , a whole dark field of thought might engulf her , and she was afraid of what it might bring . If Jemmy had actually come upon his father in a love scene with Morgan Channing in the woods , if he had told his mother innocently enough  --  what had this knowledge meant to Virginia ? Lora crossed the room to French doors that opened upon a little side veranda , and stood looking out upon whipping branches and dry leaves tumbling across the yard . This house , tucked against the hillside , had some shelter , but how wild and windy it must be today up on Morgan 's hilltop . The thoughts swept back , engulfing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suicide . But she would n't , she must n't think of that . How terrible would then be the blame heaped upon Wade . Had Jemmy told his father ? she wondered . Did Wade dream of what Virginia knew ? Lora was sure that whatever had happened had been Morgan 's doing , yet Wade could not be completely exonerated . If this was the burden he carried in secret  --  the fear that his wife , because of his own action ? 1 No wonder he detested Morgan , did not trust her . But surely Virginia must have known what her sister was like . Surely she would have put no stock in Jemmy 's words . Not when she was so confident and sure of Wade 's devotion . Or had she been ? What depth of attraction existed between Wade and Morgan to have burned anew after the passing of so many years ? Had it perhaps never died out entirely ?  | Carriage wheels crunched upon the drive . That would be Wade now , coming home . She ran upstairs to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts into some semblance of order could she face him again . He must not read this guilty knowledge in her eyes .  | AFTER DINNER that night Mrs. Tyler summoned Ellie to her room to assist her into the wheel chair for the first time in weeks . She ordered a fire built in her sitting-room grate and had herself wheeled into the dining room where she could see exactly what vandal 's act had taken place behind her back . Having looked at the substitute picture , she sent for Wade , lectured him thoroughly and then asked for Lora . Lora had been pretending to read in the library when Wade came to fetch her . The look on his face as he came in was reassuring . " What on earth have you done to Mother ? " he asked . " She ate a whopping good dinner in her room and now she 's ready to lick her weight in wildcats . She seems to be spitting mad at you and enjoying life thoroughly . " Lora released her breath in a long sigh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good back rub , bully her a little , and tell her if she wanted to run this house her own way she 'd have to get up and do it . " " Well , she 's up  --  and you 're in for it , " Wade said . " She wants to talk to you right now . And I 'm coming along to watch . But do n't count on any help from me . This is your party . " He squeezed her arm lightly as they went down the hall to Mother Tyler 's sitting room and she knew he was not displeased . The old lady was once more in her easy chair by the fire , its high wings hiding her face as Lora entered . Her hands lay folded in her lap , atwinkle with the rings Lora had set upon  | them that afternoon , and she held a lace handkerchief daintily between two fingers . " Good evening , Mother , " Lora said . " I 'm glad to see you up and looking so well tonight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not in my grave , " the old lady said tartly . " Sit down and stop staring at me . " She looked at Wade . " Nearly froze me to death this afternoon , she did , and tried to break all my bones . " " Evidently it 's done you good , " Wade said . Lora took the chair opposite her , smiling faintly . Amanda Tyler could no longer frighten or intimidate her . Not since Lora had felt this day the dry , aging flesh beneath her fingers , turned the frail body in bed , treated her like any other bedridden patient . Now she knew the vulnerability of Amanda Tyler 's flesh . Wade drew up another chair and waited , like a spectator at a play . The performance , as he must have known , lay between these two women and needed no interference from him . " I have been in the dining room , " Mrs. Tyler went on , " and I have seen that ridiculous print you 've put in place of the excellent game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three such simpering ninnies looking down at me from my dining-room wall . " Lora said mildly , " It was the best Jemmy and I could find . " " Well , it wo n't do . On your next shopping trip to New York I shall expect you to get something more suitable in the way of flowers or fruit . " " Yes , Mother , " Lora said , her lips twitching . " Mind you , that game bird painting is a fine one . My husband paid a large sum for it . It was the sort of thing he liked . But by this time I believe it has earned its worth in service . As a matter of fact , I always detested the thing . But I do not like to see good money wasted . " The audience was plainly over , and Mother Tyler turned her attention to a heap of papers on the table beside her .  | " Everything has been neglected , Wade . Everything . I want Mr. Niles here tomorrow without fail . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She said nothing at all about Jemmy 's dog . Indeed , there was no mention of it then , or at any time in the next few weeks . Mrs. Tyler 's recent illness was ignored by herself and never mentioned by other members of the household . The only difference from the old life was that sometime during each day Lora went down to the old lady 's room and gave her a vigorous alcohol rub . There was little conversation between them during these occasions . Weak flesh surrendered to ministering hands , and for that little while there was no question about who was in control . At all other times , however , Mrs. Tyler was again herself , despotic and demanding . But Lora no longer felt the sting . She had somehow placed herself beyond the reach of Mother Tyler 's whiplash . Wade too escaped to some extent these days , being caught up in an active part in Murray Norwood 's plans . He had substituted a cane for a crutch by now and got around with much greater ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , as he probably would all his life . But at least he had an active interest now and there had been no recent retreat into the dark room at the front of the house . One April morning Lora awoke to find that a thick bank of fog had moved in from the sea to envelop Staten Island . When she stepped outside after breakfast she found that the day was almost balmy and that a little breeze stirred the mist into drifting shapes along Dogwood Lane . It was so warm that she needed only a shawl for a walk today . She was eager to explore this secret mist-wreathed world and set out briskly . There had been little rain and the road was dry and rutted . Lora walked aimlessly , ready to follow any whim . There was a lift to her steps in response to the feeling in the air that anything might happen  --  a feeling that was part of the coming of spring . These days everything was so much better at the Tyler  | house than she had ever thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing in the library , and it was good to see him busy and occupied . If her own place in his life was a quiet one which required little of her , she was all the more grateful to have it so . If they could be friends and comrades , that was enough and she served some purpose in life . The troublesome thoughts that had haunted her for a while after Jemmy 's revelation had faded to the background of her mind . Such matters which belonged to the past were better forgotten . Understanding them could not change what had gone before . Let old wounds heal and old griefs die . The important thing was not to prod the wounds anew . A sea breeze parted drifting mist along the road and a tall black skeleton chimney emerged from the new-budding branches around it . The old Hume place . Lora had always wanted to explore it  --  and when could there be a more suitable time than now when it was touched by soft fog fingers of mystery ? Always before the place had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perfect . Lora had worn her old brown dress without the restraint of hoops , and now she gathered up her skirts and hopped across the ditch that separated road from ruin . Once there had been a carriage drive bridging the ditch , but water running down the hill had worn a channel through . Traces of the old driveway were still to be seen beneath encroaching grass and the rank overgrowth of weeds . Lora picked her way between a bush that would burst into white snowball blooms and a hydrangea , unbeautiful now with its lack of blossoms , and tripped over something hidden beneath the grass . As she bent to see what it was , a faint shiver ran through her . Once an iron fence had stood here . There were still rusting portions which had fallen flat and lost themselves in the undergrowth . Immediately beneath her foot lay a spike of iron . The picture Serena had drawn for her of the happenings at her fifteenth birthday party flashed back and Lora pulled her foot away and went on hastily .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful arch of doorway above them . Steps which led nowhere , a doorway into emptiness . At either side stretched the remains of crumbling , blackened walls . Even nearby objects wavered in the mist , their colors deadened in the gray light , changing their outlines even as she looked . Beyond the empty doorway where mist rolled in billows there was nothing  --  as though you might step from doorway into empty space . For just a moment Lora experienced a feeling she 'd had sometimes as a child . One shivered at the unknown , yet enjoyed the shiver , aware that it was only imagination which formed strange shapes and figures , at the same time half believing they were real . Lora went up the steps and paused beneath the arch . There was a little platform of brick here , and then a dropping away into what was now a grass-grown interior . She felt for the ground with one foot and then slipped down into the cup of mist gathered among the ruins . Here the new grass , bright with the upsurge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she began to trace her way through the outlines of what had once been rooms . There were only heaps of rubble , a few charred timbers where interior walls had stood , but she could still make out the shape of rooms , the doorway openings . Where a blackened chimney rose , still firm and strong , a hearth lay open to mist and wind , with the broken marble of a mantel above it . The sight was somehow more lonely than all else . Long ago a family had lived here . They had laughed and loved , quarreled , died . Wade as a little boy had spent hours between these walls . So must Morgan and Virginia . Serena and Adam had lived here . Perhaps if she listened intently she could hear the echo of old laughter , old tears . She might even hear Wade 's cry as he fell from the fence that dreadful day . For this , surely , was a haunted place . But only the distant sound of foghorns and whistles from the harbor broke the listening silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | On a warm and sunny day unhaunted by mist , this might be a place to come with Jemmy if she wanted to get him back into the pleasant habit of reading aloud outdoors . They could bring an old quilt and spread it in the shadow of the chimney , have this wild , lonely place to themselves , read to their heart 's content . Reading aloud had been so much a pleasure of her own childhood that she wanted to share it again with another child . Perhaps such a sharing would bring about a still closer understanding between herself and Jemmy . The misty air was brighter now , and there was a luminous glow touching it from above . Soon the sun would dispel the mist and this would no longer be a place of memories and mystery . Still exploring , she started through a broken doorway , her skirts brushing over bright new grass , catching on the reaching branch of a sassafras bush which had sprung up in this once forbidden area . She bent to release her skirt from the reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the dry wood . Her fingers moved along the nubby twig , her imagination already envisioning the full blooming of spring that lay only a little while ahead . She must watch for it this year . She must be conscious with all her senses of the tiny unfurling of leaves , of the delicate tracery of color that would burst into lush growth in so short a time . This was a magic not to be taken casually for granted as it had been in the past . Perhaps it was this sudden awareness of the wakening life about her that made her catch the tiny flash of gold beneath the bush which had snatched at her skirt . She knelt and reached beneath the branches . Some small piece of metal it was . Perhaps a forgotten possession of those who had lived in this house before the fire . She held the circlet on her palm and turned toward a gleam of sunlight slanting through the fading mist . It was a hoop of gold hung from a small gold nub , with fine gold wires which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoop earring . She recognized  | it at once  --  she had seen a pair such as this and remembered them well . This was Rebecca 's earring . But how had it come to this place ? At some time in the weeks since Lora had last seen Rebecca with this very ring swinging against her brown cheek , she must have come to this ruin . The ring must have slipped from her ear without her knowing it , so that she had come away without it . But why had she been here in the first place ? Lora moved out of the ruins and back to the road where mist still rolled before the breeze , thinning now , preparing to lift altogether . Still pondering the puzzle of the earring , she walked slowly up the road toward the woods path that led uphill to Morgan 's house . Perhaps she would climb the hill and return this hoop to Rebecca . Providing , of course , that it could be managed without Morgan 's knowledge . Somehow , Lora suspected that Morgan would not approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet why should Rebecca not do just as Lora herself had done , if the spirit moved her ? wander in the woods , explore ? What else had she to do with her spare time ? There was a sound of footsteps on the road and Lora looked up from the bit of jewelry in her hand . Her fingers closed over the earring to hide it and she walked more briskly , as if there were real purpose behind her steps . Out of the mist before her a man loomed suddenly , and of the two , he was the more startled . His skin , darker than Rebecca 's , bespoke his blood , and he wore the rough clothes of a workman from the docks . There was anxiety in the look he turned upon Lora , though he dropped his gaze quickly and touched his finger to his cap in greeting . " ' Morning , ma'am , " he said , and went quickly by while her answering good morning followed him . She glanced at the gold earring and then thoughtfully after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend after all ? I lad there perhaps been rendezvous held in the ruins of the old Hume house ? But she must jump to no hasty conclusions .  | The man 's presence on the road very likely meant no more than some mission to the Lords ' or the Channings ' . Nevertheless , the look in the man 's eyes , so hastily hidden , remained to be considered . Lora turned onto the path , her decision made , and hurried uphill through the woods .  | LORA EMERGED UPON the high curve of the lane where sunshine glowed bright and golden on the sea of mist below . The tall columns of the Channing house made white exclamation points of grace in the shimmering light . Hamlin 's mother barked as Lora approached and John Ambrose came out the door of the cottage by the gate . He smiled when he saw her . " Good morning , Lora . A fine day it 's going to be , now that the mist is burning off . If you 've come to see Mrs. Chanting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can send Rebecca ? " Lora shook her head . " It 's not Mrs. Channing I 've come to see , but you , John . I 'm what my father used to call busting with curiosity . There are so many things I want to know about . " " Fine , then , " he said . " Let 's have a talk right now , if you do n't mind coming into my small place . " He led the way up the steps of the stone cottage where he evidently had his living quarters separate from the big house . Lora stepped into a bright , cozy room where a fire burned in the big stone fireplace and light poured in at every window . The furnishings were plain , with no woman-touches to be seen . A long deal table without cloth , where breakfast dishes still waited , stood in the middle of the floor . There were several straight wooden chairs , and two somewhat battered rockers , one of which John Ambrose pulled toward the hearth for Lora . Under a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simple enough quarters , but comfortable for a man who lived alone . Strange , nevertheless , when he  | was the father of the woman who lived so comfortably in the great empty house at the hilltop . Perhaps he read her thoughts as he added a log to the fire . " I could have rooms up there if I liked , " he said . " But for me this is more what I 'm used to , more comfortable . I dress as I like , come and go as I please , and there 's none to bother or fuss because I wear no long tails or high hat . " Lonely though , Lora could not help but think . And surely not what Virginia would have wanted for him . Where had he and his wife lived when Virgina was first married ? she wondered . She rocked comfortably for a few moments , the earring still hidden in her hand . Ambrose began clearing the table , carrying dishes to the sink . She was glad that he chose to keep busy while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a lot for the Tyler household , " he said , pumping water into a pan . " Jemmy tells me you 've even got her sitting up again running things . " Lora nodded . " Was Mrs. Tyler always like this ? I mean so domineering and  --  and sometimes unreasonable ? " " She has a lot of her pa in her , " Ambrose said , rubbing a cloth over a big homemade cake of brown soap . " Old Jason Cowles was all iron and nails and I guess she took after him pretty much . Too bad she could n't have taken after him still more  --  they 'd have both of ' em liked that . I mean if she 'd been a boy . " " I know . I 'm surprised sometimes at the way she thinks like a man about business and the war and outside affairs . It 's a wonder she ever married . And yet she can also behave like a spoiled , petulant woman . " Ambrose paused with a big white coffee cup in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always plenty of woman in her , in spite of the way her pa tried to stamp it out and make her all man . Those rings she wears and the way she keeps her hands so nice . But mostly the woman part got buried where you could n't see it so easy . " " Was she unattractive as a girl ? "  | " Well  --  maybe to some . She got the idea in her head that she was too plain for any man to like , and anyway her pa kept ' em all away from her . Maybe that 's how she came to fall so hard for the first fellow who came along after he died . " " I saw her husband 's picture in the parlor , " Lora mused . " He looked like a handsome , reckless sort of person . I 've wondered what he saw in her , and she in him , when they were so different . " Ambrose snorted and began rescouring the cup . " What would he see  --  a fellow like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she an innocent about men 's ways , for all that she was in her thirties and knew shipping and banks inside out . " " I believe you like her , " Lora said softly . He looked around at her then , his eyes as sharply blue as jemmy 's beneath grizzled brows . " I have liked her for a good many years , ma'am , " he said simply , humbly . Oddly shamed , Lora turned from his direct gaze and began studying a rough bookshelf set up beside the fireplace . There were several well-worn volumes on it and she read their titles curiously . Something by Benjamin Franklin , a collection of Emerson 's essays , a volume by Matthew Arnold , and some titles by Sir Walter Scott . She knew now where Jemmy must hold his visits with his grandfather  --  here in this very room with its books and serene atmosphere . She was beginning to understand the keynote of this man to which she had responded from the first . It was a quiet repose that had nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwrought by any contact with the tempests of the . world . Undoubtedly John Ambrose had sailed stormy seas before he had reached this haven of quiet where the hurricane could no longer rock him . " I 'm sorry , " Lora said at last . " I 've seen Mrs. Tyler only as someone who has hurt Wade and Jemmy  --  not as a woman who has been hurt herself . " Ambrose had gone back to his dishwashing . " I 'm not standing up for the hurting things she does to people , " he  | went on . " It 's just that I ca n't forget the day when she came back from her honeymoon with Jack Tyler and began to live as a bride in that house where she 'd grown up under her father 's thumb . It did n't take long for Mr. Jack to show his colors . But how could she have known what to expect when she 'd pretended all her life not to care for men , and when they cared so little for her ? She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . And once they were married , he did n't keep up the pretty ways that had won her . He held the purse strings then , according to law , and he could do as he liked . So he filled the house with his dogs and his friends and his liquor . He even started bringing women in when he was drunk enough . But the second time that happened I knocked him down and he did n't try that again . Not in her house , anyway . " Lora looked at the old man in surprise . He smiled at her expression and dumped out his pan of water . " You 're wondering why he did n't fire me ? Well , to tell the truth , he did . But me and my family just stayed on for a while and he let things drift . Besides , when it came to a real scrap , I think he was always just a mite scared of that wife of his . Mostly she shut herself in her own rooms and had nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere with something she wanted to do about Wade , she told him to keep hands off or she 'd take one of his own guns and deal with him for certain . Scared him good , I guess . Even scared me , for fear she 'd really do something crazy like that . Maybe that 's why he did n't make firing me stick . She would n't have it and he 'd learned to know a brick wall when he saw one . " " What a terrible childhood for Wade , " Lora said sadly . Ambrose wiped a cup and hung it neatly on a hook in the cupboard nearby . " Worse than you can guess , ma'am . Because , while he was n't like either of his parents , he was more like his father than he was like her . But she was bound she could change nature and turn him into the spittin ' image of old Jason , his grandfather . Everything he was good at she made nothing of , and she nagged and prodded and pushed  | all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even his papa got sorry for the boy sometimes , but he did n't dare interfere , and anyway he was n't much for the father stuff  --  not him . I never saw a little tyke who needed to be loved more than that Wade boy . He did fine , too , away from home . Girls always liked him and lots of the boys did too  --  except the real roughnecks . He was plenty smart when he forgot that his mother thought he was stupid . Outside , people listened toi him and made a lot of him . And he warmed to that the way Jemmy warms to you . " " Virginia listened to him , did n't she ? " Lora asked gently . His back was to her and he did n't speak for a minute . He hung up his dish towel and came toward the fireplace . " Virginia thought he was Apollo and Lancelot and Abelard rolled into one . But I guess he did n't believe all that himself . Maybe in a way he was leaning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you 're good for him  --  he 's beginning to find out he has some belief in himself after all . " " But am I good for him ? " Lora murmured . " I had n't thought of it like that . " He reached toward the mantelpiece for a pipe in a cracked bowl , then remembered his company and drew back his hand . " Please smoke , " Lora said quickly . " My father always smoked a pipe . I like it . " He took the pipe down and packed it with tobacco , held a taper to the fire and lighted the fragrant weed . Then he drew the other rocker up to the fire beside her . " One thing I ca n't understand , " Lora said , " is why Wade should include you in his feud with Morgan . " " That 's simple enough . " Ambrose rocked for a moment and drew on his pipe . " He offered me a home in his house after we lost Virginia . My wife had died a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funny thing , Lora  --  maybe it makes no sense , but no matter how much of everything Morgan 's got these days , I still feel like I need to be around ,  | standing by . Just in case what she 's got does n't turn out to be enough after all . " " I 'm sure she does n't appreciate that . " " It makes no matter . Something inside me bids me do this . But you can guess how much it peeved Wade . He wanted nothing to do with her , and when I chose to make my home here , he was mad enough to include me in the way he felt about her . " " Thank you for telling me these things , " Lora said . " I 'm not prying idly  --  I want so much to understand . Serena has told me a few things too . So has Jemmy . And even Morgan . I can fit all the bits and pieces together and begin to see the pattern . But , John , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are made to be . I do n't want to believe that Wade , or Jemmy , or Mother Tyler , or I can only be part of a set pattern that was fixed in the beginning . " " I know what you mean , Lorie , " he said . Her eyes blurred at the sound of the name he must have picked up from Jemmy . Hearing him use it was like hearing it on Doc 's lips . Ambrose reached toward the bookcase beside him and pulled a volume from the shelf . " Just the same , Lorie , there 's a weaving to start with we ca n't much help . There 's a casting of the colors and a starting of the pattern that we 've nothing to say about . Something 's handed us and we have to go on with it . But the going on is up to us . " He paged through the book and she saw that it was by Matthew Arnold . " Listen , Lorie , " he said . " The will is free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The seeds of godlike power are in us still : Gods are we , Bards , Saints , Heroes , if we will . " Lora sat very still and the words seemed to echo in the room long after Ambrose had closed the book . His voice had not  | been made for reading as was Wade 's . His words lacked any cultured cadence , but she sensed wisdom in this man , and a simple goodness . A log fell with a small crash in the grate and Lora came back to the present with a start and felt the circle of gold still held within her palm . She uncurled her fingers and showed the earring to John Ambrose . " I found this in the woods today . I think it belongs to Rebecca . " He nodded . " She 'll be glad to have it back . Her mother gave her that pair long ago , she said . She felt bad about losing one of them . " " I found it in the ruins of the Hume house , " Lora told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look at her . " I wonder what Rebecca is really like , " Lora said . " I do n't think Morgan regards her as a person at all . " " You 'd like to return the earring to her yourself , would n't you ? " Ambrose asked . " Suppose I go look for the girl and send her here . Wo n't take me a minute . " She waited while he went out of the room . Once she got up and looked through the windows on the downhill side . But the woods shut off the view and there was only the cool brown of clustered maple and oak across the road . Rebecca 's step in the doorway was so light she might not have heard her entry had not the door squeaked as the girl closed it . She stood there with her back against it , bright in her usual gay plumage , looking at Lora guardedly . Against her cheeks hung hoops of tortoise shell . " Mr. Ambrose says you want to see me , ma'am , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassuring . " Good morning , Rebecca . Come in and sit down , wo n't you ? " The dark eyes gave her a quick , bright look of suspicion as Rebecca came into the room . Reluctantly she seated herself on the very edge of a chair and waited for whatever might come next .  | " I found your gold earring this morning , " Lora said . She leaned toward the girl , extending it on her palm . " It was under a bush in the old Hume place . " " Oh ! " Rebecca gasped . " We looked all over for it . " She took the earring while mingled relief and pleasure flashed briefly across her face . Then it was dark and shuttered again . " I reckon I 'd better go back now . Mrs. Channing will be needing me real soon . Thank you for finding this , ma'am . " Lora watched her helplessly . She wanted to offer her help if Rebecca needed it . Yet there was no way to get past her suspicion , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had used the word " we . " " I 'm glad you 've found a friend , " Lora said gently . Rebecca clasped her hands together , the earring pressed between her palms . " Mrs. Channing does n't want me to  --  to have  --  friends . You do n't know how Mrs. Channing gets when she 's mad . " " Mrs. Channing ca n't keep you from having some sort of social life , " Lora protested . " She can if she wants . " " But you 're not a slave . You can do as you like . It 's not for me to interfere , but if you wanted to leave her employ tomorrow you could easily get work elsewhere . " Rebecca shook her head . " I ca n't leave . She 'd make real bad trouble . Besides , she pays me more than I 'd get most places . " " What can you do with money if you have no life of your own ? " " I ca n't ? " Rebecca stopped , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a servant 's but as the eyes of another woman looking for an assurance that she could trust . " I 'd like to help you , Rebecca , " Lora told her . " If there 's anything I can do ? " For the first time her sincerity seemed to penetrate the other girl 's guard . Rebecca spoke softly , in a little rush of words .  | " I 'm saving to buy freedom for my mother and my little sister , ma'am . They 're still back home and they belong to Mrs. Channing . But she said she 'd sell them to me if I save my money . That is , if I 'm a good girl and do just like she wants . " For a moment Lora was at a complete loss for words . What a brutal weapon to hold over the girl 's head , to cow her with , and make her a chattel . Why should Morgan want to do so cruel a thing ? Besides , she was a Northern woman  --  she had no right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need pay no attention to that now , " Lora assured her . " President Lincoln has freed all slaves in the states that are fighting against us . So your mother is free . She can come here any time . " Rebecca shook her head disbelievingly . " Mrs. Channing says the President 's Proclamation do n't rightly mean much . She says it wo n't mean much unless the North wins the war . And the way she thinks , the North is n't going to win . " Unexpectedly a flash of denial went through Lora . " Of course the North must win ! " The thought surprised her . Until now she had believed her whole being to be set against war itself , wanting neither side to win . This unexpected upsurge of loyalty for the cause of the North indicated a change of which she had been unaware . She recovered herself and went on . " I 'm going to see about this , Rebecca . I 'm going to see if I can find some way to help . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll sell them quick as a wink if she thinks I 'd try anything . No 'm , Mrs. Tyler  --  I guess my way 's right for me . It 'll take a long while , I reckon , but ? " Her words were lost in the sudden opening of the door . The hand which had pushed it open was plainly an angry one , and Lora turned in her rocker to see Mrs. Channing herself in the doorway . Morgan had flung a wool mantle over her wrapper and nightdress , her dark hair hung thick and heavy over her shoulders , and there was wrath in her eyes .  | She took in the tete-a-tete before Rebecca could rise from her chair , her indignation centering upon the colored girl , ignoring Lora . " So I am to ring for a half hour in the morning without being answered ? " she cried . " When I go in search of you , Clothilde tells me you are down here . What is the meaning of this ? You are having your morning tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your own right ? " Rebecca said nothing . She stood submissively before her mistress with downcast eyes . Lora had been too shocked by the outburst to move , but now she too rose to her feet . " Good morning , " she said , trying with her calm greeting to draw Morgan back to quiet and reason . " You must n't blame Rebecca for this . It is entirely my fault and ? " " It is no one 's fault but Rebecca 's , " Morgan snapped , not troubling to glance in Lora 's direction . " She knows where she is to be in the morning when I waken . She knows her duties exactly . But lately I 've noted some uppitiness and I wo n't stand for it an instant . These people must be kept in their place . Well  --  what have you to say , Rebecca ? " The colored girl hesitated a moment , then held out her palm with the gold earring upon it . " Mrs. Tyler found this on  --  on the path and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down here and see her , ma'am . " " And are you in Mr. Ambrose 's employ or mine ? Mrs. Tyler 's or mine ? " " Yours , ma'am , " said Rebecca in a low voice . " Give me the earring , " Morgan commanded . " I 've never liked that pair anyway . " Rebecca made no move to obey . She stood like a woman of bronze , scarcely breathing . " Please listen , Morgan , " Lora pleaded . " I understand that Rebecca 's mother gave her that pair of earrings . It 's natural that she should treasure them and be glad to have the missing one back . If I had known I was interfering with your rising time ? " " Give it to me ! " Morgan repeated .  | Rebecca took a step backward and put her hand behind her . For the first time she raised her eyes and looked at Morgan directly , not as servant at mistress , but gaze for gaze , as woman to woman . " Such impudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck the colored girl a resounding smack across the cheek . Rebecca 's golden skin turned ashy , except for the place where dark blood surged up beneath the blow . But she stood proudly and her eyes did not falter . Lora went to the girl 's side and touched her arm gently . " Go now , please . Fix Mrs. Channing 's tea , or whatever you must do . " She squeezed her arm gently , secretly , impressing her friendship . At her touch Rebecca turned and went from the room , moving with her usual soft and graceful step . Morgan stood where she was , angry , distraught , unbeautiful now with her skin rage-mottled , her nostrils distended . Without speaking , Lora reached for her shawl and flung it about her shoulders . " Good day , Mrs. Channing , " she said formally , and went toward the door . Morgan seemed to see her for the first time , and for the first time to be uncertain . " Wait , Lora ! It was n't your fault , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to take the side of one of her kind . " Lora said nothing . She opened the door and went through it without a backward glance . John Ambrose came quickly to open the gate for her and she knew that he surmised what might have happened . " Do n't let her do anything to Rebecca , " Lora whispered as she went through the gate . The old man shook his head sadly , and it was not in promise . " I 've never in my life been able to keep that one from her headlong ways . I 'm sorry , Lora . " She went down the hill slowly . The sun was high and warm now  --  a true spring day bestowed as a gift before May was here to sanction spring 's appearance . The breeze that had blown the mist away rippled the surface of the little pool in  | the woods . A soft , rippling motion sped across the surface . Like quicksilver , Lora thought , remembering jemmy 's words . She stood beside the water , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hilltop . The young Morgan of long ago who had turned in a rage to kick down a house of twigs and then teetered her way recklessly along an iron fence was still there , untamed , beneath the present Morgan 's polish . Such rages were something Lora had never witnessed and even the memory made her a little sick . Perhaps there could be an illness of the spirit , just as there was physical illness . The words John had read aloud returned to her mind : The will is free . . . Gods we are . . . if we will . But demons too , she thought , destroying ourselves and those about us .. . if we will . She turned away from the pool , found the place where the path opened on the downhill side . For the first time she was shaken in her conviction that she had been right in helping to persuade Wade to work with Morgan Channing and the Knights of the Golden Circle .  | IN THE WEEK or so that immediately followed , Lora saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet reigned again and Rebecca had made peace with her mistress . Lora did not forget her promise to the girl , but she had as yet thought of no way in which she could help her . Then one night in April Wade came home from a meeting at Morgan 's bearing news . Lora had gone to sleep , but his tap at her door woke her and she called to him to come in . Only embers burned on the hearth , but he knelt to renew the fire without lighting a candle . Lora lay beneath the covers and waited till the fire was going and he had pulled up a hassock where he could sit before the warmth and stretch out his lame leg . Every now and then he came to her room like this to talk for a while and then went away again . Sometimes a sudden flare of love-making might follow , but more often not . It was as though Wade were gradually coming to accept her as a person in herself , instead of as a substitute or as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made love to her only when caught up in the old , dangerous make-believe , and she was relieved to find these times coming less often . She had an affection for him , yes . Perhaps even a growing affection , but it was not that of sweetheart for lover , or wife for husband . She still shrank within herself at his kisses and could only lie inert beneath his touch . Often when he came home after one of these meetings he was keyed up , tense , eager to release himself in talk with her before returning to his own bed . And these times she was  | coming to value , as she might have valued the confidences of a brother of whom she was fond . In this role of listener she could give herself gladly and even find satisfaction of a sort . Lora turned on her side , watching him from the warmth beneath the quilts . " Is it going well ? " she asked . From the first she had found Wade entering into the spirit of secrecy that bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what went on at Morgan 's . Thus she took care never to ask a pointed question , but only those of a general sort which would reveal her interest without making her seem to pry . " We 've had wonderful news from the Middle West , " he said . " Norwood has received a report of the draft being stopped in several sections , or at least so successfully resisted that it has been postponed . " " I hope this is managed without violence , " Lora said anxiously . " There 's been none to speak of , I believe . Of course one ca n't make that absolutely sure . The human element is too uncertain . But Norwood assures us there will be no armed revolt , if that is what you mean . Often a quiet show of force is all that is necessary . And desertions are on the increase all the time . " Lora lay quiet , wishing she might ask more direct questions , obtain details which would quiet her doubts , and enable her to better understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he might have said too much . " Adam is down with another bout of fever . I stopped in to talk to him tonight , but he was in bed with his shivers and sweats , and much too miserable to discuss politics . " " You are n't planning to draw Adam into this , are you ? " Lora asked uneasily . " Why not ? He ca n't be any lover of war after what he 's gone through in prison . " She turned beneath the covers . " I 've heard him . He seems bitterly intent on winning the war on the Union side . It might be just as well not to talk to him about these things . He could cause you trouble if he liked . " " Perhaps you 're right . " Wade stared into the fire again for a space of time , lost in his own thoughts . " How is Morgan ? " Lora asked cautiously . " Raging mad tonight , " said Wade . " Mad as any spoiled child who has lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away . " Lora sat up in bed . " Oh , Wade ! The poor thing ! Though you ca n't say she 's run away when she 's perfectly free to come and go as she pleases . " " But she has n't done that . She has n't given notice and left her job properly . She has simply disappeared . Into thin air . She must have sneaked away at night because her room has n't even been slept in . Morgan did n't know she 'd gone till she started to ring for her the next morning . " Lora sighed . " Morgan must have driven her into a corner to make her go . Did you know that the girl was working there because Morgan said she 'd let her buy freedom for Rebecca 's mother and little sister ? " " Sounds like Morgan , " Wade said dryly . " No , I did n't know that . But the mother and sister are free now anyway , if they want to be free . " " I told Rebecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And perhaps it does n't unless there is still some way to get through Southern lines and escape to the North . I wonder where she 's gone . " " If she has any money she could go anywhere , I suppose . " " I do n't think she 'll want to spend it on herself . She 'll be trying to find some way to get her family up here . Now I wish I 'd tried to take a real stand with Morgan . " Wade turned from the blaze so that he could look toward her shadowy corner . " You ? Take a stand with Morgan ? What do you mean ? " She told him then what she had held back till now  --  the  | story of what had happened in John 's cottage on the hill , of Morgan 's rage and of the way she herself had been helpless to do anything but walk out . When she was through , Wade came over to sit on the edge of the bed , where he could see her better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the gale , stirring things up . I have n't held it against you that you would n't listen to me and must go to Morgan 's anyway . But now you 've raised the sort of rumpus that is sure to occur if anyone crosses her . Let her alone  --  stay away from her . " Lora pulled the covers up to her chin and looked at him rebelliously over the edge of the quilt . " You 're blaming me for what happened . That is n't fair ! " " Nevertheless , " he said , " if you had n't climbed the hill to talk to Rebecca , none of this would have happened . You could simply have given the earring to Ambrose and he 'd have returned it quietly . You 'd not have stirred up this hornets ' nest . " His words seemed to her the last straw . " I 'm not afraid of Morgan , " she said , " even if you are . " She could sense the stillness of him , the angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pettishly , but the way people catered to Morgan made her furious . Someone had to show the woman that she could n't ride roughshod over those who were weaker than she . " Why should I be afraid of Morgan ? " Wade asked coldly . There was no turning back now . He was already angry , so perhaps this was the time to go ahead , to step boldly into the dark labyrinth . " I 'm not quite sure why you 're afraid of her , " she said . " Jemmy calls her Morgan Le Fay and says she 's like that plotting queen . And of course there are those who say she has always wanted you and that she 'd cheat and lie and steal to get you . " He put a hand upon her shoulder , pushing her back against the pillow . " What are you talking about ? Say what you mean ! "  | " There was a time something happened , " she said , not moving , though his fingers hurt her shoulder . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . Perhaps it is n't true at all . Perhaps it 's just one of those stories that go around . About you and Morgan . " His fingers tightened . " Jemmy ? Jemmy 's been telling that beastly story again ? " " Then it 's not true ? " He let her go and turned away . For a long moment the only movement in the room was firelight flickering on the ceiling . Then he got up and went toward the door without speaking . Lora slipped out of bed , her long braid swinging against her back as she hurried across the room . She stepped between Wade and the door , her shoulders against it , pity and understanding welling up in her . Now  --  now she was beginning to see all the sad , ugly pattern . " So that 's why you turn away from Jemmy ? Because he told his mother and because you think Virginia . . . But it is n't true , Wade ! I do n't believe it ! Virginia knew her sister . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have forgiven you for anything . " " It was n't a matter of forgiving . " His tone was so low that Lora could barely catch the words . " She wanted me to have whatever I wanted most in life . If she came to believe  --  it was just the sort of thing she would have done . " Lora put her hand across his mouth . " No ! You must n't say it . You must n't think it . And you must n't go on blaming Jemmy for something he did so innocently . " He drew away from her hand . " I blame only myself . But when I look at the boy I remember . Now , if you 'll let me by ? " For the first time she understood fully his inner torment , which was so much worse than she had imagined . It was one thing to suffer the tragic loss of a dear one , but something far worse if you carried as well a sense of guilt about her death .  | She wished she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , try to heal and comfort by the very nearness of her body . Perhaps even dispel the doubt and confusion that was part of her own being at times with the physical reality of caresses . But she would not play Morgan 's role . She slipped away from the door and ran barefooted back to her bed . Once again warm beneath the covers , she held her breath as he went out , heard him close her door , go softly down the hall . She listened intently as another door opened , closed again , and only then did she relax in relief . It was his own door , not Virginia 's . She overslept the next morning . When she opened her eyes bright April sunshine burnished the windowpanes , birds proclaimed the day , and the air was alive with the tingle of spring . She yawned widely and stretched to her very finger tips . Last night 's unhappy ending reached out to possess her mind , but she would have none of it . Today she would laugh at Wade if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mother Tyler . And right after breakfast she would go to see Serena , taking along a basket of fruit for poor Adam at the same time . Serena might help her in the matter of Rebecca . Unfortunately her brave plans began to go awry almost at once . She came downstairs in her new gown of dove gray , to find Mrs. Tyler and Jemmy already at breakfast . The boy was not eating , and his grandmother was obviously in a towering dudgeon . " I am sorry to be late , " Lora apologized , slipping into her place . " Has Wade overslept too ? " Jemmy threw her a tragic look and began to fiddle with his porridge spoon . " Eat ! " said his grandmother , and Jemmy forced the spoon to quivering lips . " Has something happened ? " Lora asked . " Where is Wade ? " " That , " said Mrs. Tyler coldly , " is what I should like to know . My son has never turned against me with thoughts  | he would not share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had better tell me where it is that he goes in the evening and why he is so often out of the house all day long . " " He does n't tell me either , " Lora said mildly . " I believe he is working on some effort that has to do with the war . Why do n't you ask him yourself ? " " I have no wish to pry , " said the old lady inconsistently . " At least he has come to his senses about one thing this morning . " Jemmy 's mouth trembled uncontrollably . He set down his spoon and ran out of the room and up the stairs . Mrs. Tyler began an indignant complaint , but Lora did not stay to listen . She set her napkin down with a hasty " Excuse me , " and hurried after Jemmy . Sure enough , he was being sick in his slop pail . She held his head gently , supported his small convulsed body until he was quiet again . Then she helped him to the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " No school today , " she said cheerfully . " But it 's too beautiful a day to stay inside . So get well fast . This afternoon I 'll show you a wonderful reading place I 've found outdoors . We 'll take some books and blankets and go there . A secret place just for us . " " I do n't want to , " Jemmy said . " I do n't want to go anywhere . " She sat on the bed beside him and patted his hand , noting that the bones no longer stood out so clearly beneath the finegrained skin . Jemmy had been eating well in the past few months . " You do n't have to tell me , " she said , " if you 'd rather not talk about it . But it would make it easier for me to help if you could tell me what happened . " He blinked to hold back the tears , his forehead still moist with cold sweat . She reached out to wipe his face and then left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said after a futile effort to stop his tears . " Papa says he has to go . This morning Ellie must have left Grandmother 's sitting-room door open and Hamlin got in there before I was up . I guess it was a new place for him because he 's never allowed there , and he must have thought it was fun . He did n't mean to do anything bad , Lorie . " Jemmy gulped and Lora patted his arm gently . " One of those shawls you and Papa gave Grandmother for Christmas was on a chair and Hamlin dragged it down and played with it all over the room . He chewed a hole in it and tore it in some other places . Grandmother heard him and rang and rang her bell , but Ellie was busy in the kitchen and she did n't come right away . And then I heard the ringing and the barking and I came running down , right after Papa . " He choked back a sob and went on . " Grandmother was furious when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go . I tried to explain that he did n't know any better because he is a very young dog . But  --  but Papa would n't listen . He looked so queer and angry . He said this was enough and Grandmother was right . He  --  he called Peter in and told him to take Ham out and get rid of him  --  to give him away at once . " Lora held the small hand tightly . " And then what hap-pened ? " He sat up in bed to tell her despairingly . " I  --  fought Peter when he came in . And when Papa held me I  --  I kicked him , and I bit him on the hand . But he did n't do anything to me . He just looked at me in the most awful way and said I 'd done more damage in my life than I 'd ever realize . Then he told Grandmother he was going out and he did n't even stay for breakfast . Lorie  --  what did he mean ? Did he mean my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , " she said quickly . " Of course he did n't mean that . " " I 'd rather have him thrash me than look at me the way he did . "  | She held him close , and for once he did not rebel at the embrace , but sobbed with his face against her neck , words still spilling out . " Do n't let them take Hamlin ! He 's my family , Lorie . He 's all I 've got . The Union does n't sell families away , like the South does with slaves . Lorie , you will help me ? " " Of course I 'll help you , " she whispered , her lips close to his ear . " You 've got me , you know . And you 've got your papa . All mothers and fathers get cross with their children sometimes , and sometimes the children get cross at them too . " " It 's not like that ! " cried Jemmy knowingly . " He hates me . I know he does . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightening in him , pulling him taut . Gently she pushed him back upon his pillow . " You ca n't help me if you keep this up . And I 'll need your help if we 're to save Hamlin . " " He quieted a little and stared at her darkly , not daring to hope . " First I 'll have to talk to Peter . But I ca n't do anything unless you stop crying and try to get a nap . Never mind school today . You just rest now . And this afternoon we 'll go out to that place I mentioned . We 'll talk about what can be done . Make plans . We 'll work things out somehow , Jemmy . You know I 'll stand by you . " Crooked over the top bar of his bed hung the wishbone Lora had put in Jemmy 's stocking for Christmas , its red bow still gay . She reached for it on sudden impulse and held it out to him . " Here ! Now 's the time for a wish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bone . They both wished silently and Lora gave the signal to pull . The larger half came away in her fingers and Jemmy 's tears started again . " You see  --  I wo n't get my wish ! It 's no use , Lorie . " She laughed out loud , surprising him . " What if I wished the same thing you did ? So either way you could n't lose ? "  | Such trickery caught his fancy and he managed a smile , relaxing a little . Now he made no protest when she tucked the covers around him , or when she opened the window wide to let in the warm smell of spring . She left his door ajar as she went out , so she might hear if he called . Then she went down to breakfast . It was a relief to find that Mother Tyler had finished and had been wheeled back to her sitting room . When she had eaten , Lora went in briefly to let her know that Jemmy would stay in bed this morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam Hume , who was down with fever again . There was a gleam in the deep-set eyes as the old woman regarded her . " Have you seen what that dog has done ? " She reached for the ragged shawl from the table next to her . " Yes , I know , " Lora said . " I 'm very sorry . But I think Jemmy is being torn much more seriously than your shawl , and I think he is more important . Now I must get Ellie to help me with a basket for Adam , and ? " " Fortunately my son does not place my feelings so low on the scale of his consideration , " Mrs. Tyler broke in . " He has ordered Peter to get rid of the dog . Something which should have been done long ago . What I ca n't understand is how he can be visiting Morgan 's house these days , as Ellie tells me he is . He knows how dangerous and destructive she can be . " " It is a political matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in politics and never was . I had thought he would be on guard against her all the rest of his life after her wicked attack on me . " Lora had started toward the door , but now she turned back quickly and saw Lie gleam of triumph in the old woman 's eyes . " So you do n't know what happened ? " Mother Tyler snapped . " Well , I shall tell you now so that you will be more careful in your association with this dreadful woman . It happened years ago when Ambrose and his wife were working  | for me . They had gone away for the day and I went out to their quarters to speak to Morgan . " She paused dramatically , watching Lora , knowing well she had her full attention . " I went to tell her that under no circumstances would I permit my son to marry her . And if he did I would disinherit him . Morgan was curling her hair at the time and she became livid with rage . She snatched up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attacked me with it . She would have struck me in the face with the hot iron if I had n't flung up my hand to save myself . I must have screamed when the iron burned me across the palm and Virginia , who was outside , ran to fetch Wade . " Lora listened in shocked silence . Mrs. Tyler turned her right-hand palm up and shuddered as she traced the place where the iron must have burned across the flesh . When she looked at Lora again the gleam was more intense than ever . " You can understand that my son would not marry a girl capable of so vicious an act . " " Yes , " Lora murmured . " I can understand . " Mrs. Tyler sighed and closed her hand . " What I did not see was that Wade , horrified by Morgan 's behavior , would turn for comfort to Virginia , who was only waiting to enfold him in her gentleness and love . But at least I hope I have made it clear to you that my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn him . " Lora said nothing . She slipped out of the room and went into the kitchen , still shaken by the story she had heard . All this was in full character for Morgan . In these sudden violent rages to which she was prone , she was quite capable of doing physical harm . Rebecca was better off away . While Ellie prepared some fruit and molasses cookies for her to take to Adam , Lora questioned her about Hamlin . " Peter 's already took the pup off , " Ellie told her . " And a good thing , I say . The critter has caused enough trouble around here . " " But where did he take it , Ellie ? "  | " He did n't say where he was going , ma'am . " Ellie paused with an apple in her hands and there was spite in her look . " You ai n't figgerin ' to do anything ' bout it , are you , ma'am ? " " I 'll do what I can , " Lora said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheer Mr. Hume a little . " Ellie was not interested in Mr. Hume . " I guess you never seen Mr. Wade get real mad , have you , ma'am ? " Lora took the basket and went out of the kitchen quickly . Before she left she looked in on Jemmy , saw he was asleep , and hurried from the house . At the Lords ' Lora found Serena floured to the elbows and singing as she worked . Serena loved to make her own bread and rolls and would relinquish the task to no cook she had ever had . " You 're just what Adam needs ! " she cried , when Lora explained her basket . " He 's in a vile mood and I know you 're the one to stand right up to him and put him in his place . " Lora shook her head , smiling . " What a reputation I 'm getting . I do n't want to put anyone in his place . " " He 's sitting in the sun on the terrace right now . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scold him a little for the good of his soul . " " But I 've really come to see you , " Lora protested . " That 's nice . But let me finish this chore first . I like to concentrate on talk for its own sake . We had towels and pillowcases interfering last time . Run along  --  right out the door there . Get a knife from the drawer first so you can coax him to eat some fruit . " There was nothing to do but obey and Lora went out to the rear terrace , where flagstones made a level space before the hill dropped steeply away . Adam sat glumly on an iron garden bench , with a blanket under him and a muffler of plaid wool around his neck . " Good morning , " Lora said cheerfully . " Serena has sent me out to scold you , but I 'm not sure what for . I 'm sorry you 've been ill and I 've brought you these . How are you today ? "  | He looked up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that there were shadows beneath his eyes . " I 'm all right , " he said . " This thing leaves as fast as it hits me . " She set the basket down beside him on the bench , but he made no move to touch it . " I 'll peel you an orange , " she said . She seated herself on the bench without invitation and chose a big golden sphere from the basket . But before she settled to the peeling she took a deep breath of warm , sunny air . The waters of the bay seemed a deeper blue than the sky today and the sails of the many vessels which dotted the water were dazzling white . Even the mushroom encampment at the foot of the hill gleamed in every detail and the bustle of soldiers on drill , artillery wagons , moving horses on parade , were plainly evident . " There 'll be action now with spring here , " Adam said , regarding the encampment dourly . " Both armies will be on the march . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long to be back where he could be part of this movement himself , and she tried to distract him by bringing up a problem nearer home . " Did you know that Mrs. Channing 's colored maid has disappeared ? " she asked . " Rebecca ? I 've always wondered how she endured serving her charming mistress this long . " Lora explained what Rebecca had told her about saving money and Adam made a grimace of distaste . " It seems to me the girl will be better off away from the place . " " I 'm not sure , " Lora said . " I believe there was a man coming up to see her secretly . But she 's young and she ca n't have been around much by herself . She could easily fall into the wrong hands . And I know she 'll be upset and worried because of what may happen now to her mother and sister . Do you suppose there 's anything we could do ? " Wedges of orange peel were coming away from the fruit beneath her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | speak she looked up to find him watching her in his quizzical way . " What about you , Lora ? " he asked . She flashed a startled look at him . " I ? What do you mean ? " " Do n't you live any life of your own ? " " I 'm doing very well , thank you , " she said stiffly . She broke the orange into sections and held it out to him . He took a section , bit into it with strong , even teeth , his look still appraising her . " I 've really come to talk to Serena , " she said , rising . " So I 'll go back inside now . " Unceremoniously , he pulled her down beside him on the bench . " Running away again ? Serena is busy and happy . I am neither . Perhaps I can help you on the matter of Rebecca . " " Do you mean you know where she might be ? " " There are quite a few Negro families down on McKeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you like I 'll go there tomorrow and see what I can find out . Though why you should bother ? " " Because she 's alone . Because she 's only a little younger than I am and friendless . And she 's in trouble . " " And you care only about people in trouble , " said Adam wryly . " One of these days perhaps you 'll find out that Lora is important too , and that she has problems . Then what will you do ? " " I have a problem right now , " she said quickly , ignoring the direction of his words . " Jemmy 's dog has chewed up an expensive shawl that belonged to Mother Tyler and Wade has given in to her demands that the dog must go . This morning Peter took him off somewhere and I must find a way to get him back . " Adam did not tease her this time . " Poor Jemmy . You 're right , of course . Take that dog away and he will be right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll keep Ham for you here , if you like , till you straighten things out . " " Thank you , " she said . " I hope Peter has taken him up to  | John Ambrose . The dog will be all right there until I 've had a chance to talk to Wade . " " Unless Morgan is mad enough to refuse to have him on the premises . She does n't forgive easily , that one . And you must have riled her over Rebecca . " " What makes her that way ? " Lora mused . " She has everything  --  position , money , beauty . She could be a wonderful person if she chose . " " She has everything but what she wants most , " Adam said , " and that makes her dangerous . Probably she has no real resentment against Rebecca . The girl was the scapegoat of the moment . Though I 'll admit that Morgan never gives up an inch of property she thinks she owns . Regardless of anything written on a paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lora sat quietly , staring out toward the blue waters of the harbor . She was sure she would never understand Morgan Channing as long as she lived . " When you married Wade you must have thrown a pretty crimp into any new hopes she may have raised after Virginia 's death . She ca n't love you for that . " " That 's nonsense , " Lora said . " But tell me what happened after Virginia married Wade . How did she take that ? And where did Morgan and her father and mother live then ? " " That was a funny thing . She did n't carry on the way we expected her to . She took the whole thing in a queer , tightlipped sort of way , as if for the first time in her life she was beaten and knew it . Wade rented a small house for her mother and father , since obviously they could n't remain on the premises as servants after he had married Virginia . Morgan went to live with them . " Mrs. Tyler would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take Morgan around to parties , and buy her clothes . She tried her best to share her own good fortune with her sister . At first people stood off  --  but they liked Wade , and no one could resist Virginia . So in a year or two Morgan was going everywhere with her new  | gowns and the fancy airs she mimicked from ladies she met . She was always clever enough . And she knew she had a natural appeal for men which she did n't hesitate to use . " " I suppose she met Mr. Channing through Virginia ? " Adam nodded . " Before the war quite a few Southerners sent their families to Staten Island during the summer . The better hotels here catered to the resort trade from the South . Nick was a widower and he used to escort his sister and her children North every year before returning home to his own affairs . But the summer he met Morgan he stayed on for a time , and she had a good chance to set her little claws into him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had position and money . More money than Wade . Morgan married him before he had time to catch his breath , and then she got him to build her that big house on the hill so they could live up there part of the year . Of course she wanted to be where she could lord it over those who had snubbed her  --  and to be near Wade . " Lora listened in silence . More small pieces falling into place , forming the pattern . " Have a piece of orange , " Adam said . " You 're not enjoying your own handiwork . Incidentally , have you any idea what Morgan is up to now with all this entertaining she 's doing ? A mixed lot she has coming up there now , with that Norwood fellow always in evidence . " " I do n't keep track of my neighbor 's business , " Lora said primly . He grinned at her . " Meaning that I do ? Of course I do . What else have I to occupy me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me , from the rumors I 've heard . Norwood is running with the Circle . " " What circle ? " Lora asked carelessly . " The Golden Circle . The Vallandigham , Fernando Wood bunch . Peace Democrats ! Maybe . But more likely rampant Copperheads favoring the South . And that , my innocent one , is treason . " " I do n't know much about politics , " Lora said . " Only what  | I pick up here and there . But is n't it possible that some of these people are just as sincere as you are ? What if they truly want to stop the war ? " " I 've no doubt at all that they want to stop it  --  by stabbing the Union in the back , by driving her down to defeat in her own territory . " Lora bit into a piece of orange , tasted the tangy juice on her tongue . His words were adding to the uneasiness that already stirred within her . But she knew Wade would never throw in his lot with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless  --  since he was more idealist than realist ? they tried to hoodwink him , use him . That was a new and disturbing thought . She repeated the old argument she had heard from Morgan and from Mr. Norwood when he was talking to Wade . " Is n't it possible that if the draft was stopped in the North the Union might be forced to negotiate with the South so that a peaceful resolution could be brought about and all the fighting stopped ? " " The United States government would not look lightly upon such notions . Try to stop the draft and the army and militia will put the resistance down in short order . Even if it means bloodshed . " " But have n't there been some places in the Middle West ? " " It seems to me that you know a good deal about these matters , " Adam broke in . " Who has been telling you these things ? " She could feel the flush rising in her cheeks , but evidently he did not expect an answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step softly or find themselves in hot water . I suppose you know about General Burnside 's recent order ? " She shook her head . " That somewhat hotheaded gentleman has ordered the arrest of anyone guilty of seditious utterances likely to obstruct recruiting . This Val , who has made himself the hero of the Peace Democrats , has been doing just that . It remains to be  | seen whether this order will muzzle him . If it does not and he is arrested there may be the devil to pay from his supporters . In any event , if Wade has got himself mixed up in any of this , my advice to you is to get him out of it as quickly as possible . " " I 'm sure Wade is quite capable of running his own affairs , " Lora said stiffly . " And I 'm also sure he 'd never have anything to do with treason . " " Let 's hope so , " Adam said , but his tone was dry . Lora rose with what she hoped was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least Adam had stopped sulking , for he grinned at her with his old mockery . " Thank you for your visit , Mrs. Tyler . You 've done me no end of good . " She went into the house without answering him and stayed a while longer , visiting with Serena . She told her about Rebecca and that Adam had offered to look for the girl down on McKeon Street . Serena promised to see that he kept his word . Soon after , Lora went home to find that Peter had returned , and that , as she had hoped , he had taken Hamlin up the hill and placed him temporarily in John Ambrose 's friendly hands . " I do n't know if Mr. Wade will approve , ma'am , but it just seems like I could n't take the boy 's dog off and give him to strangers . " " The more fool you , " said Ellie , listening to his words disapprovingly . " There 'll be the old Ned to pay with both his nibs and her nobs when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house all day and all evening . His mother complained and fretted , but finally went to bed . Lora sat up in the library , comfortable in her old warm wrapper . The air had turned cool after the summery day and a fire felt good again . Tonight a high wind was blowing and rattling the windowpanes , setting dry vines scraping across library windows  --  the only sounds in a still house . Lora had curled herself on the sofa before the fire with a copy of Leslie 's Weekly in her lap , but as often as not the pages , with their vivid drawings of battle scenes , lay unheeded and her thoughts wandered uneasily . If Wade had gone to New York for the day and evening , he had missed the last boat home by now and there was no point in sitting up waiting for him . On the other hand , if he were on the island he might come home at any moment and she had the feeling that she wanted to be up when he came in . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken Hamlin up to John Ambrose , she had gone in to tell the secret to Jemmy . She found him awake and listless , but when she gave him her news about the dog he recovered quickly enough . Nevertheless , Lora kept him away from his grandmother and brought up a tempting lunch on a tray . When the old lady lay down for her afternoon nap , Lora took Jemmy out to a sunny nook in the Hume house , where dandelions already dotted the bright new grass and yellow forsythia hung above their heads over a crumbling wall . They read aloud to each other , talked lightheartedly , and nibbled  | the molasses cookies Lora had brought along for a special treat . Reassured that Hamlin 's absence was temporary , Jemmy was no longer despairing . Late in the afternoon she let him run up the hill by himself to visit the dog and his grandfather . Now all that remained was for her to make good her promise that Hamlin would soon be returned to the arms of a welcoming family . The vine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and at intervals wind whined down the chimney . She wished Wade would come . The later the hour , the more uneasy she grew . Sometime after midnight she went out to the kitchen and set the kettle on the stove . Even if Wade did not come at all , a cup of tea would be comforting . But as she returned to the library , she heard the sound of a hackney out on the drive and a moment later Wade 's key clicked in the lock . She waited for him at the library door , and was aware of his lack of pleasure when he saw her . But she hurried to take his hat and help him off with his coat , pretending not to notice . " You 've had a long day , " she said cheerfully . " Come in before the fire and rest a minute . The kettle 's heating on the stove and we 'll have a cup of tea in a little while . " Perhaps he had expected stormy words from her over the dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , he seemed to relax a little . He did not object when she plumped up pillows behind him on the sofa and covered his legs with a comforter as he stretched out . She sat down on a hassock close to the fire and began to talk of inconsequential things . " One of these days would you mind if Jemmy and I rummaged in the attic trunks ? " she asked . " Jemmy thinks it would be fun , and I 'd like to give him the pleasure . If you do n't mind , of course . " " Do as you like , " Wade said listlessly . He looked tired , as he did so often these days , and she  | was afraid he was trying too much for his newly returning strength . A movement made him grimace and she knew his leg must be paining him again , as always happened when he asked too much of it . When he seemed at length to doze , she tiptoed out to the kitchen and prepared a big brown earthenware pot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's last baking , and she set up a tray attractively with a linen cloth and a sprig of the forsythia she and Jemmy had brought home that afternoon . From the dining room she brought one of the nested tea tables and set it at Wade 's elbow to hold the tray . He roused himself sufficiently to smile at her . " You 're spoiling me , " he said . She smiled serenely as she poured the tea . With silver tongs she dropped two lumps of sugar in his cup , and added cream . Then she poured tea for herself and sat down once more on the hassock , watching the fire . After a while her silence , or perhaps the stimulating warmth of strong tea , seemed to urge him into words . " Norwood offered to take me on his rounds in New York , " he began , " so I went over with him this morning . I 've been there most of the day . We came back here for dinner and another meeting on the island . The movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Nevertheless , there was a puckering between his brows . " Do you still feel that what these people are doing is right ? " Lora asked quietly . He stirred his tea , still thoughtful , as though torn by indecision . " Not all of it . In theory , in principle , I can be with it . Even in much of the choice of action I can go along . But there are aspects I distrust . Mind you , this is to go no farther than these walls , Lora . " She nodded , waiting for him to go on . The tea was hot and a little bitter . She had brewed it strong and heartening , He went on , still puzzling aloud . " As long as we work with men of reason , men of integrity , I can feel satisfied that the  | movement is honorable and its purposes worthy . But there are those in the group who are not preaching the passive resistance I had been led to expect . Today we went into quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to stir up violence . I 'm not sure how this unlettered and even criminal element is likely to behave when the time comes . I heard one man assure the audience that Lincoln 's government was highhanded and oppressive . And he quoted Vallandigham in saying the draft was unconstitutional . " " But do n't political parties always talk like that ? " " This seemed a deliberate effort to incite . I heard murmurings about how the Negro freedmen coming North would take away the jobs of New York citizens . There seems to be a mounting resentment against the Negro which is both regrettable and dangerous . " Lora listened , her dismay growing . None of this sounded auspicious . " If you do n't like the way things are going , is n't it possible to withdraw from the whole thing ? " she asked . " I 'm not sure I want to do that , " Wade confessed . " So far I 'm not sure of what the actual plans are , or where this whole thing is going . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far I 've been kept on the outskirts of the movement , not admitted to its inner circles . Perhaps I can do more good by going along than by stepping out . If the worst came to the worst , I might be able to swing my weight in opposition . " " Is there any danger to you in this ? " she asked uneasily . He hesitated just long enough so that his answer was not completely reassuring . " I'rri scarcely involved . But I know they 're raising money out west to arm deserters . Editors who are in the movement are publishing demoralizing pieces in the papers . Copies are then sent to soldiers to encourage desertion . I do n't like it , Lora . This has its ugly aspects . " She reached for his hand and held it , that being the only comfort she could offer .  | His smile was suddenly contrite . " And you , my dear ? I know I left you a difficult situation to handle when I went out this morning . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did , " she admitted frankly . " Jemmy got sick again and had to be put to bed . Your mother was practically shooting out sparks of triumph and lording it over us . And Peter had already taken the dog away . " Wade set his cup and saucer down and leaned back against the pillows . " Why did you treat Jemmy like that ? " Lora asked directly . He made no effort to defend himself , or to bring up the matter of the ruined shawl . He was plainly regretful now . Vii ! " The boy was there before me , " he said miserably , " and suddenly all I could see was the harm he had done in telling Virginia about that day in the woods . Then he had told you the same story too , and I was cut to pieces all over again ? remembering . When the matter of the shawl came up it gave me a chance to punish him  --  through the dog . " " And you 've been sorry all day , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply . " It 's not the boy 's fault , but mine . Yet I ca n't help the way I feel about him . And now the thing is done . " Lora let his hand go and settled back on the hassock , clasping her fingers about her knees . " The dog has been taken only as far as Morgan 's . John Ambrose has him . He can be brought back whenever you like . " " Then get him back tomorrow . Settle things with my mother , Lora . You can handle her better than anyone else . " Lora thought about that . She could do what he asked easily enough . And if she performed this service he would be relieved and grateful . He would need to take no further blame upon himself if his mother became ill again , or otherwise behaved badly . " Lora , " Wade said softly , " what are you thinking ? Where have . you gone ? " She looked at him then , seeing clearly what she must do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Wade  --  to  | get the dog back and deal with your mother . But the order was yours and the responsibility is yours , too . I think you must stand by what you 've done , or else undo it yourself . " There was disbelief and hurt in his look . Then he closed his eyes again . She rose and carried the tray out to the kitchen . She set the dishes in the sink and nibbled the last cookie . When she returned to the library she found that he had not moved . But he opened his eyes when she came in and looked at her . " There 's nothing I can do , " he said coldly . " You must understand that . If you will not help , then the dog must stay where he is . I will not stir everything up all over again . " " If that 's the way you wish it , " Lora said . She picked up his cane which had fallen to the floor and put it into his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly and went out of the room . Later , while she was undressing , she heard him climbing the stairs in his slow , painful way . She blew out her candle and crawled between cold sheets , shivering at their touch . She was not at all sure that what she had done was wise , or kind , or sensible . Even now she longed to run to his room and tell him she would take the responsibility herself and do as he asked . Then he would be happy again and the forlorn look would go out of his eyes . Unbidden , Adam 's words returned to her : " You only care about those you can help . " Was this her own weakness perhaps ? Were she and Virginia sisters , all too prone to make others dependent upon them ? She slept fitfully that night and was early awake Saturday morning . Everything in her resisted the day ahead . It was a day which was likely to be fraught with hurt and resentment and argument . Or if not these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the surface . That rain washed against the windowpanes was a matter which suited the mood of the day . At breakfast Mother Tyler was cheerful and triumphant . How fine , she said , that they were having a little rain . Not  | only because the farms on the island needed it , but because the woods were too dry and that always made for a fire hazard . Too often in both spring and fall , fire swept through the beautiful island woods , destroying them . The old lady ate as she had not eaten in a long while , and she talked of news in the papers , of the last business word given her by Mr. Niles . She asked Wade no pointed questions about his absence the day before and did not mention the dog . But she wore her victory like a crown and because of it vitality seemed to surge through her . Wade was remote , retreating into a shell of absent-mindedness that seemed to give him some protection . Behind it he need not recognize the cause of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son or Lora . Right after breakfast he said he was going to work on his book and shut himself away in the library . Jemmy was quiet as any mouse . He knew wherein lay the cause of his grandmother 's cheerful mood , but Lora saw by the secret look he gave her that he was putting every confidence in her promise to get back his dog , and that he was willing to bide his time until she could manage the matter . She was distressed , however , to see the expression he turned upon his father , who seemed not to notice his dark look at all . Mrs. Tyler did not wait for anyone to trundle her wheel chair back to the sitting room . When she had folded her napkin , she turned the wheels herself and sent the chair vigorously toward the door . As Ellie ran to open it , Mrs. Tyler spoke over her shoulder to Lora . " I know just what I 'd like this morning , if you 're free , Lora  --  a good back rub . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps I 'll sit on the front veranda for a while . When Ambrose comes to spade the garden I want to talk to him . I 've some notions of my own on the subject this year . " Lora followed her into the sitting room where she was out of Jemmy 's earshot . " I 'm sorry , Mother , " she said evenly , " but I 've made plans for Jemmy this morning . After the loss which has been inflitted  | upon him he needs comforting . I wo n't have time for your back rub today . " Mrs. Tyler looked plainly shocked at this open defiance . " Do n't be ridiculous ! You can see that the boy is already over his upset about the dog . He never had one before , and he does n't need to suffer over not having one now . Besides , it was not I , but his father , who gave the order . You need n't try to take it out on me . " " Would you like Ellie to rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " Come here ! " the old lady cried . " I 'm not accustomed to having people leave while I am speaking . As I 've said before , you 've been badly brought up , Lora . You need to learn courtesy to your elders . " Lora returned calmly to stand beside Mrs. Tyler 's chair . " I am listening , " she said . " Then do as I ask , " Mrs. Tyler snapped . " Jemmy and his imaginary sorrow can wait . Surely the comfort of an old woman must come before that of a small boy . " " Not for me , " Lora told her quietly . " You are strong and healthy and ought to be up and around , instead of babying yourself in a wheel chair . Now , if you do n't mind , I 'll go tell Ellie you want her . " " I do not want Ellie ! " Mrs. Tyler raged , and now there was a shrill note in her voice . She enjoyed a fight only so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the door and down the hall , leaving the silver bell ringing indignantly behind her . Jemmy had already climbed the stairs to his room . When she looked in on him he was playing with his turtles , though without any great enthusiasm . Turtles must seem insipid company after a boisterous , affectionate little dog . " Do you think Hamlin misses me ? " he asked as Lora looked in the door . , She nodded her conviction . " I 'm sure of it . Just as you miss him . But you may go up and see him again when it stops raining , and in the meantime I hope you 'll be patient .  | If Hamlin comes back this time , let 's make sure he 'll never be sent away again . Next time Peter might have to take him somewhere else . So let 's wait awhile , Jemmy , until everything can turn out for the best . " He nodded and looked out the window . " It should n't ever rain on Saturday . " " Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just right for doing things you do n't do other times . " " What things ? " he asked , a faint interest stirring . " Well , we could explore the attic . You said you 'd like to ? remember ? It would be warm enough up there today , since the sun beat on the roof all day yesterday . I 'm going to put on an old dress and cover my hair with a sunbonnet to keep out cobwebs and dust . Then I 'm going to dip into some of those old trunks and see what 's there . Your papa said I might . Of course I wish I had a helper  --  but if you 're too busy with your turtles ? " He dropped Lancelot back on his sand pile with a plop and grinned at her . " You make schemes , do n't you , Lorie ? I like surprise schemes . " " I 'm a very scheming woman , " she said . " I 'll call you when I 'm ready , " and she went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an old , faded one she had often worn in the yard back home , though somehow it had never prevented her skin from turning brown . Mostly because she could never resist the temptation to lift her face to the sun 's warmth and soak it in through her skin . At least the bonnet would keep cobwebs away . " You look funny , " Jemmy said as they climbed the attic stairs in single file . " Like a farm lady who 's going to milk cows . " " You 're wrong , " she told him . " I 'm an island lady who is going to open trunks . " They had brought a half-dozen candles today and Jemmy set them around in places where they would do the most  | good and not catch anything on fire . Rain pattered cozily over their heads and gurgled in pipes and gutters . Shadows retreated to the corners , or swung themselves up the slanting beams of the roof , hovering there like giant birds . It was not exactly warm in the attic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nearest trunk offered itself and Jemmy raised the lid eagerly . There were the usual old clothes , hats , shoes , faded artificial flowers . Jemmy found a battered top hat and set it on his head , where it slid down to his ears and made them both laugh . There were dust and cobwebs aplenty and now and then the explorers sneezed , but this was undoubtedly a wonderful way to spend a rainy Saturday morning . Now and then things which had belonged to Virginia turned up , but Lora noted that while Jemmy identified them and looked at them sadly , he did so without bursting into tears . The terrible urgency of sorrow had lessened in him with the passing months , just as it had in herself . The hurt was there , but the thrust was not as painful as it once had been . One could bear now to be reminded , and even begin to remember the comforting things that at first faded in the immediacy of loss . The third trunk they opened contained something different and Jemmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's old toys , and even toys that belonged to my grandmother when she was a little girl . Mama showed them to me once when I was little . Lorie , do you think Grandmother could ever have been a little girl ? " Lora laughed . " I 'm sure she was . A little girl with griefs and disappointments and pleasures just like our own , Jemmy . " He pulled out a doll with a painted china head and kid body that must have been his grandmother 's , and studied it thoughtfully , but she suspected that he did not believe her words . She reached in next and pulled out a funny-looking clown that had obviously been homemade . Its suit was of black  | alpaca , with tufts of yellow yarn making pompons down the front . The cotton-stuffed head had been painted with goggle eyes and an enormous turned-up grin which had faded to a pale pink outline with the years . Orange-colored yarn had been sewed to make a shaggy , bright wig that topped the fellow off . " That clown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it to me to play with when I was little . I wondered what happened to it . Grandmother made it for him . I used to sleep with it at night and Papa did too , when he was a little boy . " Lora perched on the corner of a packing case and held the clown in her hands . There were other toys of Wade 's coming to light now  --  a cart with one wheel , a garland of painted wooden spools , blocks with pictures of children rolling hoops pasted on them and curling off at the edges . But the clown intrigued her most , and she continued to hold him . " Look , " Jemmy cried , pulling out several copybooks , " these must have been Papa 's composition books . " But he was more interested in toys than in schoolbooks , so he dumped them beside Lora and reached into the trunk again . She picked one of them up and leafed through it idly . He had written a neat and decorative hand , that small boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that his description was of a visit to the docks , and she read a few lines , her interest caught . The writer 's excitement and response to the color and life , to the odors of spices and tea , came through in his words . What a shame that his mother had scorned these efforts and had discouraged them . It seemed that there was talent here  --  more than had been revealed in that stilted effort at a novel which he had read to her . She would take these books downstairs and read them more carefully . From the distant reaches of the house the jingling sound of the doorbell reached them and Lora went to the head of the stairs to listen . In a few moments she heard Ellie padding upstairs in search of her , and she turned to Jemmy.  | " It must be for me . Do you think you could put things back by yourself , Jemmy ? We 've really spent a long enough time up here for one morning . We want to leave something to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant to stop , but agreed with a sigh as she hurried downstairs , still carrying the clown and the stack of copybooks . " It 's Mr. Adam , " Ellie told her , puffing from her climb upstairs . " He wants to see you , ma'am . I 've shown him into the parlor . " Adam . That must mean news of Rebecca . She thanked Ellie and hurried past her down the stairs , not even seeing her astonished look . She went into the parlor , where Ellie had lighted a lamp against the usual gloom , never thinking of her appearance until Adam stared at her . " Good morning , " he said . " Is this a new style ? The wearing of sunbonnets on a rainy day ? " She remembered then and set the clown and copybooks down while she untied the strings and pulled the bonnet from her rumpled hair . " I 've been in the attic , " she said , as if that explained everything , and then hurried on . " Do sit down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took a chair , looking amused . " I 've seen her , " he said . " I 've talked to her . " " That 's fine ! " Lora drew a breath of relief . Rebecca had been steadily on her conscience ever since she 'd learned about the girl 's action . " Then she 's all right ? " " Yes  --  and in good hands . The young fellow she 's been seeing has a very sensible and intelligent mother . Rebecca is staying with her . But the girl is upset and concerned over what she has done . She must have run away when her position became intolerable , and has been worrying about the consequences ever since . " " She does n't want to return to Mrs. Channing , does she ? " Adam shrugged . " I know she fears that Morgan may take some action to punish her through her mother and sister . I  | tried to assure her that there was little possibility of that while the war is on . " " Morgan would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lora said . " Do you think the girl would return to her employ ? " " From what she said , I gathered that she would . But she 's afraid that Morgan would never take her back now . That 's where you come in . " Before Adam could explain , the door of the library opened and Wade came across the hall to the parlor . " Good morning , Adam , " he said . " I heard voices and wondered if something was wrong . " Lora explained about Rebecca , and Wade , limping over to a chair , listened somewhat remotely . " I 'm sorry for the girl , " he said , " but I heartily dislike having Lora meddle in Mrs. Channing 's affairs . If you 're interested in this matter , Adam , perhaps your sister , Serena ? " " Let 's go back to the beginning , " said Adam , still amused . " This visit of mine to McKeon Street was made at the request of your wife . So I presumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her . " Wade threw Lora a look of disapproval . " Had you consulted me , I could have made this trip to McKeon Street myself to find the girl . I do n't quite understand ? " " Then perhaps you 'll go to see Morgan about her ? " Lora asked hurriedly . Adam did not wait for Wade 's answer , but rose with an air of relief . " At least there 's nothing more I can do about the matter and I promised my sister not to be late for luncheon today . So if you 'll excuse me ? " He managed to bow himself out of what had promised to develop into a family disagreement , and took his leave of them both with a flourish , in which there remained an irritating amusement . When he had gone Wade turned to Lora in despair . " My dear , why must you be so headlong ? "  | She suppressed a twinge of indignation and turned to pick up copybooks and clown . The clown 's goggle eyes seemed to regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a faint one of her own . " What did you call this fellow ? " she asked . " I suppose he had a name ? " Wade looked at the doll in blank astonishment . " Where on earth did you find that ? " " Jemmy and I have been exploring the attic . He said you used to sleep with this when you were a little boy . " " I suppose all children sleep with their toys at some time or another . Why have you brought the thing downstairs ? " Why had she ? In a way , she knew . " I thought he might tell me things about you , " she said . Color darkened Wade 's face , but his look softened . " What a strange little person you are , Lora . I never know where to find you next . I thought we were discussing Rebecca and Adam  --  and here you 've turned me to the subject of a toy I had when I was small . " " I want to hear his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , if you must know ? Jupiter . A most unsuitable name for a clown , but I thought it was just right at the time . " " Jupiter , " said Lora softly . " Certainly a power to guard you through the night . And I 've more treasure trove , " she went on , holding the copybooks up for him to see . This time he moved toward her as if he would take them out of her hands , but she held them away , laughed in his face and ran into the hall and up the stairs . Near the top she turned to look down at him and saw that he was watching her with an odd , puzzled look . " The trouble is , " she said , " you try to make serious sense of me . How did your book go this morning ? " His lips tightened again . " It has gone where it belonged ? into the kitchen stove . I read through what I 'd written this morning and I recognized it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library then and closed the door behind  | him . She stood for a moment staring at the door , then went more slowly up the last few steps . Jemmy had come down from the attic , having put things back by himself . He had heaped a pile of loot on the floor of his room and through his open door Lora could see him kneeling beside it , examining his treasure . She went to her own room and put the copybooks in a dresser drawer . Then she carried the little clown to the window , where daylight touched him through rain-streaked panes . " So your name is Jupiter , " she whispered . " Jupiter , the all-wise , the all-powerful . If you 're all that , then perhaps you can help me . Perhaps you can teach me what he is really like . "  | LORA WAITED until Monday before she made any move in Morgan 's direction . For one thing , she preferred to act on a day when Jemmy would be in school and when Wade had planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Circle . Then , too , she wanted to be sure she did not act on impulse . Too often she seemed to leap into events without proper forethought . But the more she considered now , the more she felt that she must be the one to talk to Morgan and find out how she felt about having Rebecca back . After breakfast , as soon as Jemmy and Wade were gone and Mother Tyler was settled before her sitting-room window where she could see Ambrose the moment he put in an appearance , Lora started up through the woods to Morgan 's house . Saturday 's rain had lasted only through the morning and the thirsty earth had soaked it up . By afternoon everything was turning dusty dry again beneath the sun . Tree branches still withheld their full treasure in nubs of green , waiting for the right combination of sun and rain to release them into a largesse of bloom . Only the bold advance guard of forsythia and dandelion were really in'blossom . She had just reached the pool when she saw John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the bank . " She 's waiting for you by her window , " Lora told him . " Then her spirits are fine this morning ? " " They 've been fine ever since she got rid of the dog . But  | I do n't think she deserves to feel fine at everyone else 's expense . Would she listen to advice from you , John ? " He shook his head wryly . " Never in all that lady 's life has she listened to anyone but her father . But I 'll bring the little dog down any time you say . " " We 'd better wait , " Lora told him . " I would like my husband to give the order . " Out in the pond something moved on the big sunny rock and fell into the water with a splash . Lora watched ripples widening across the still surface . " Turtle , " the old man said . " They like the sun . " " I wish spring would hurry , " Lora said . " It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " It will be . " She remembered then and turned to him contritely . " I 'm sorry . About your daughter , I mean . You must hate this place ? " He shook his grizzled head . " There is no wickedness here to hate . It 's not in me to hate a pool of water , any more than I do the poison ivy when it stings me . " This was almost what she had said to Rebecca . She was glad he felt that too . Now she took her courage in her hands and spoke her puzzled thoughts to him . " Virginia would never have died by her own hand , would she , John ? What is the truth of what happened ? " He stood for a long moment watching the now quiet water . " I 've heard what they say , " he told her at last . " I think she would not . But then  --  I would never have thought she would marry Mr. Wade either . " He looked at Lora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one to understand the strange things women do . But still , I feel she would not . " " I never knew her , " Lora said softly , " but I feel that too . If only Wade could believe it . It would be better to have it only Jemmy 's turtles than what Wade thinks happened . " He gave her a quick touch of the cap and turned away down the hill , and she knew that sudden emotion had moved him . She went on uphill , lost in her own thoughts , and  | emerged at the top to find a faint haze in the air and a smell of smoke . Sometimes there were brush fires along these hills and the wind would carry the smoke for miles . But little breeze stirred today and she wondered where the haze was coming from . Both Hamlin and his mother bounded to greet her as Lora let herself through the gate . At the sound of their barking a woman stepped to the railing of the upper gallery of the big house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting , as though they had not last parted on anything but friendly terms . Morgan bowed gravely , but made no returning wave . She remained at the rail waiting for Lora to come up the drive . " Do you smell the smoke ? " Lora asked as she approached the house . " There must be a brush fire burning . " " I came out to see if I could locate it , " Morgan said . " But I can see nothing from here . " She seemed to be waiting for Lora to state the purpose of her visit . " May I speak with you for a few moments ? " Lora asked . Morgan nodded somewhat distantly . " The door is open . Wo n't you come upstairs ? Clothilde is busy at the moment and I 'd like to search out this fire . " Lora ran up the few steps and beneath the graceful fanlight of the front door . She had never been upstairs in this house before and she looked about with interest as she mounted the curving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the wide upper hall and led the way at once to an unused bedroom at the rear . Here the furniture stood shrouded against dust and the room was dark . Morgan went to French doors and flung them open . " There 's a balcony here , " she said , " where we 'll have a good view . " Lora stepped out upon the small balcony with its wroughtiron rail , and found that she could see out over rolling hills and into the deep cut of a valley . Few signs of habitation were visible . Brush or thick woodlands climbed hill and dale and only the villas of the wealthy encroached upon this first rim  | of hills overlooking the bay . Here and there a strip of road could be seen , and sometimes a clearing that marked a farm . Beyond the servants ' quarters and stables the hill dropped steeply down from the crest . Morgan pointed to the opposite rise of hill . " There 's the fire . If the day remains still we 're probably all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like it . Well , there 's nothing we can do , so come in and tell me why you wanted to see me . " Her tone was hardly cordial , but she led the way to a small upstairs sitting room that was scarcely any more cozy than the vast drawing room below . The circular mirror over a marble mantel was heavy with gilt ornament . Stuffed birds and artificial flowers set in the middle of the mantel were covered by a dome of glass , and on either side stood a tall Italian vase . The carpet was thickly flowered in yellow , its color repeated in heavy draperies and the silk of quilted chairs . One could easily get mental indigestion from such rich fare , Lora thought as she seated herself somewhat stiffly in a chair indicated by Morgan . Her hostess wore her favorite black today , but without jewels to relieve the somber effect . Her face seemed paler than ever , her eyes intensely dark by contrast . Lora suspected that Mrs. Channing had not been sleeping well of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at Lora without welcome . As usual , she was direct and made no gesture toward superficial courtesy . " I should not have thought you would return to see me so soon after your last unfortunate visit . You have some special purpose here today ? " " I 'm not here to plead for myself , " Lora said quietly . " I 've come about Rebecca . " " Yes ? " said Morgan , waiting . " I have wondered if you intended to take any steps about the girl ? After all , she was useful to you and ? "  | " I shall take steps the moment I locate her , " Morgan said . " She will return here to work or I will bring charges against her . " " Charges ? " Lora echoed , taken aback . " What has she done ? " Morgan 's wide mouth curved vindictively . " Theft , naturally . These people always steal . " " That is n't true ! " Lora cried indignantly . " I 'm not accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lora glimpsed a wayward and hoity-toity little girl behind the words . " Any number of articles have been missing since Rebecca left . Of course it will be my word against hers , and who will believe anything she says ? " Lora could only stare at her in dismay . She longed to tell this woman that she would take Rebecca 's word against hers any day , but she knew open accusations would do no good at this point . In any event , since the girl wanted to return , perhaps this simplified matters . " You will need to bring no charges . " Lora managed by an effort to keep her voice steady . " We have been in touch with Rebecca and I believe she will return to you if you want her . But I think in the interest of decency you will need to promise her some better treatment . " Morgan sprang to her feet and paced to the window and back . " How dare you tell me what I must dol I will promise her nothing . She will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how thoroughly I hold her in my hands . " " Because of her mother and sister ? I do indeed know . But must you humble her further ? Is n't it possible to be kind ? " Morgan turned from the window . " When did anyone ever trouble about kindness with me ? Do n't talk sentimental nonsense ! I am beginning to think you as silly as Virginia . " " Very well , Mrs. Channing . " Lora stood up with an air of finality . " I shall visit Rebecca myself and advise her not to return to your house . I believe there is no way in which you can harm her mother and sister at this time . When the war is over they will no longer belong to you . They do not now ,  | in fact . As for your charges against Rebecca , I can only believe you are mistaken and they would come to nothing . " Morgan took a step toward her and Lora had an uneasy moment of wondering if the woman was capable of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible effort to control herself . Surprisingly , she flung out her hands in a gesture of capitulation . " Very well ! Bring her back and I 'll promise what you ask . " This sudden giving in seemed strange coming from Morgan Channing and Lora was no little puzzled . " Why do you want her back so much ? " she asked curiously . Something flickered in Morgan 's eyes and was gone . " She is well trained , useful to me . There 's no point in being difficult about the matter if she wants to return . She should be punished for her behavior , but since you ask it , I will waive that . " Lora rose . " Thank you , " she said gravely . " I will let her know as soon as possible . " She put no trust in Morgan 's words , but after all , if Rebecca were mistreated again it would be easier for the girl to leave the second time . And she herself would keep in touch with affairs through John Ambrose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin haze that stung her eyes and made her cough . A window stood open at the rear of the house and a breeze was blowing white mist into the hall . Only it was not mist . " The wind has come up and the smoke is blowing this way ! " Morgan cried . She ran toward the empty rear bedroom and Lora followed her onto the balcony and stood beside her looking out over tree-studded hills . As was its custom on Staten Island , the wind had come up suddenly and now the burning on the opposite hill was no longer a smudge of smoke , but had seared its way to the valley , leaving , a black path behind it . A great flaming area was now visible . Lora choked as a gust of wind blew the white smoke their way . Morgan twisted her hands together .  | " If this wind holds , my house is in the fire path ! And we 've nothing but brush around us . I 'll have to find my father . Something must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lora hurried after her . " Your father 's gone down to our house . I met him in the woods when I was coming up . I 'll hurry home and send him up here . " " Get Wade too , " Morgan cried . " And Adam . Every man you can find . I 'll have the stable boy give the alarm . " Morgan ran toward the rear of the house and Lora went out the front door and hurried down the drive . On the way she paused to look back at the house , her eyes searching the second-story level . Yes , there was a fire mark of copper nailed near an upper window  --  an oval plate with crossed torches and the insurance number . So the fire companies would not turn back from the house for lack of pay . She plunged breathlessly down the hill , tripping now and then over a root across the path , sparing herself not at all . The smoke haze had not yet crept down the hill and John Ambrose was digging placidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyler house . Mother Tyler sat watching him critically through the open window where her chair had been wheeled . " There 's a fire coming up through the woods toward Morgan 's house ! " Lora cried as she ran into the yard . " Morgan says you 'd better come home at once , John . Peter can go up there too , and I 'm going to fetch Adam . " " Lora ! " Mrs. Tyler called from her window , and the girl turned impatiently in mid-flight . " I ca n't stop now , " she told the old lady . " If Wade comes home you 'd better send him right up there . They may need every man they can raise . I 'll come back as soon as I can . " She had seen woodland fires at home and knew what this ruthless foe could do . When she reached the Lords ' she did not wait for the polite ringing of the bell to be heard , but pounded on the door and shouted for Adam . He came at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still looked sallow from his recent attack of fever , but at least he was well again . " There 's a fire coming up the hill toward Morgan 's house , " she told them . " If the wind stays as it is now there may be real danger . " Adam assured Serena that there was nothing she could do and came with Lora at once . Together they started toward the hill path and Lora had to trot to keep up with Adam 's longer stride . " You 'd better go home , " he advised . " And keep a watchout . If this thing gets out of control it could burn its way down this side of the hill too . Though the Channing grounds and the upper curve of Dogwood Lane make a natural firebreak which may help . " " I 'm going with you , " Lora said . " There 'll be things I can do at Morgan 's and they 'll need every hand . " He threw her a quick look , but offered no objection . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they reached the level of the pool and stopped a moment for breath . Adam did not look too fit , and Lora regarded him doubtfully . " Perhaps you should n't be doing this . After all , you 've been ill and ? " " Do n't trouble being sorry for me . I 'm all right , " he said shortly . " Have you talked to Morgan yet about Rebecca ? " Lora nodded . " This morning . She 's going to take her back . Though first she was full of threats about bringing charges against her , punishing her  --  I do n't know why she gave in so quickly . " " Well , let 's get on , " Adam said and they hurried upward again . Ambrose and Peter were already on hand . Clothilde , the French housekeeper , and the other women servants were drawing water from the well , while men stood on ladders throwing pails of it upon the roofs of stable and servants ' quarters nearest to the danger . Over everything hung the  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bells of rival fire companies could be heard clanging up the hill and in a few moments the horses of the Zephyr Company appeared , pulling the heavy engine up the drive , while volunteer firemen overran the grounds . A few were equipped with red hats and shirts , but most of them had come dressed as they were when the alarm sounded . Hose was quickly lowered into the well and volunteers manned the hand pump . Lora stood for a few moments watching the single , thin stream of water begin the doubtful task of watering down the space of brush back of the Channing grounds . The second fire company had arrived shortly behind the first , but its men stood idly by , watching the progress of the fire up the hill . It was likely that they would not lift a finger unless the first company agreed to " slice the melon " by sharing the insurance company 's reward . The sight made Lora indignant , but she knew there was no way to oppose this ridiculous system . Not even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , setting a huge coffee pot on the stove . The reviving powers of the brew would be needed in the hours ahead while all hands worked at the emergency . Through the kitchen window she could hear the not too distant crackling of flames . The stifling smell of the fire now pervaded the entire house and her eyes smarted constantly . Morgan came up from the cellar carrying a stack of gunny sacking to be taken outside and soaked with water , in the event of hand-to-hand fighting with encroaching flames . She glanced at Lora , apparently taking her efforts for granted , and ran outside at once with her burden . Lora found big china cups kept for the use of the servants and filled them with the steaming liquid . These she set on a tray and carried outside to serve to whoever needed a respite . Again and again she made the trip , for the coffee was accepted gratefully wherever she went .  | The scene was one of furious activity by now . More distant neighbors , attracted by the blaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with a will except for the idle volunteers , who stood about cracking jokes at the expense of the working company . But still the flames ate their way upward and the sound of the roaring grew constantly louder . One could feel a pulsing of heat in the air , even at this distance . The wind blew in uncertain bursts and there were moments when it seemed that it might shift to another direction . But always it veered again to the uphill attack . Now many of the men had stripped to the waist in the warming sun , facing the still fiercer heat of the fire as it blazed up the hill toward them . Lora could not refrain from keeping a nurse 's eye out for Adam , who should certainly not be up here doing such work as this when he had been so recently ill . But she did not see him among the groups she visited . After she had handed around her current serving of coffee she looked for him deliberately and saw that he was working alone at a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working toward the lane of a firebreak that had been started immediately back of the servants ' quarters . Lora set her tray of empty cups down and picked up the last cup of coffee she had been saving for him . Then she walked behind the buildings to the place where his ax lifted and fell against the brush . It looked as though there would be little time left before the whole fight would become a hand-to-hand matter , with only wet gunny sacking and that single weak stream of water to fight the devouring fury . Adam saw her coming and threw down his ax for a moment as he wiped dripping sweat from his forehead . He grinned as if he were really enjoying himself . His shirt was streaked with soil and plastered against his body , and he took the time now to pull it off and toss it in a heap on the grass . His muscular shoulders and stocky torso shone wet in the sunlight .  | " Hello , Nurse , " he said . " You could n't be more welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and drank the coffee in a few deep draughts . As he drank he stood with his legs braced and his hand shook a little when he gave back the cup . She began to feel sorry that she had summoned him to this task . " You should n't be doing this , " she told him . " Could n't you work at something less strenuous ? You 're quite likely to collapse and then the others will have to stop work to come and carry you into the house . " " I 'm not the collapsing kind , " he told her , and weaved a little on his legs . She put out a hand to steady him and he startled her by catching it in his own . There was a daredevil light in his eyes . Before she could pull away , he drew her into the circle of his arms and put his mouth hard upon her own . She could feel the damp warmth of his body beneath her hands , taste the salt sweat of his kiss . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her lips were soft beneath his own . Then she pushed away furiously , wiped her palm across her mouth . As suddenly as he had drawn her to him , he held her at arm 's length , laughing down at her , recognizing fully her instant of surrender . " Your  --  fever has returned , " she cried desperately , hating the tremor in her voice . " I 'll send someone here at once . " He had picked up the ax to return to his work , but now he let his hand fall and leaned on the handle . " Wait ! I 'm suffering from no fever . I kissed you because that was what I 've long had in mind . And if you were not a rabbit  --  but since you are , you 'd better scurry for safety , lest I try it again . " She could find no words stinging enough with which to demolish him . She picked up her skirts and fled toward the house with the hateful sound of his laughter ringing behind her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous . Her blood burned with hot anger and her hands  | trembled . She could only hope that no one had seen what had happened . But now the roar of the fire was frighteningly near and she put the thought of Adam out of her mind . Tiny , fluttering tongues of the enemy advance reached to the very edge of the cleared space , like the flags of an invading army , and smoke rose blue above the spreading area of fire . Every gust of wind carried drifting smudges of ash . The defenders stood ready with wet sacking to flail at any lighting spark and the firemen rested a moment at their pumping and held the hose ready to quell such attack as might be made on the roof or wall . If only the wind would cease its irregular blasts , the stable might be saved . Long since , the horses had been removed and tethered in the lower woods at John Ambrose 's direction and the carriages moved to safety . But the servants ' quarters were over the stable and now Clothilde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or carrying them away tied in bed sheets . Now and then Lora glimpsed John Ambrose moving capably and calmly among the excited throng . There was no time now for coffee ; the real battle was about to be posed . Lora carried her tray of empty cups to the kitchen and set them down with a rattle as the disturbing memory of Adam 's kiss swept back . Even more disturbing was her realization of the momentary response she had given him . She dampened her handkerchief and scrubbed her mouth free of his kiss . But there was no time to waste on personal resentments . She must find something else useful to do . Perhaps she could help remove valuables from this house , in case the danger increased . She went into the hall , meaning to look for Morgan , when she heard the sound of raised voices from the front of the house  --  as if some argument was going on . This was no moment for ordinary manners and she hurried to investigate . The drawing-room door was ajar and she pushed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs toward her . Morgan seemed to be resisting indignantly some  | request which Wade pressed upon her . Lora broke in on them at once . " Morgan ! The fire has reached the cleared places now . If it jumps to the stable anything can happen . Have you packed up what you want to save ? You may have to abandon the house . " Morgan looked at her as blankly as though she had forgotten the fire . But Lora 's words seemed to encourage Wade in his purpose . " It has to come down , " he insisted to Morgan . " You must n't risk having it burned to ashes . " Anger blazed in Morgan 's eyes . " I am still mistress of this house . I 'll be happy to see it burn with the house , if the house must burn ! " Wade turned away from her to stride the length of the room as swiftly as his limp allowed him . And now Lora saw his purpose . The draperies had been pulled back from the painting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw the kitchen knife in his hand and realized that he meant to cut the canvas from its frame . Morgan , however , flew down the room ahead of him , her state plainly one of near hysteria . " Let it burn , I tell you ! I wo n't have Virginia staring at me any longer with those pale eyes . All along I 've wanted to see that picture destroyed . " " Do n't behave like the heroine of a bad play , " Wade said coldly , and there was a lash to his tone . " I 'm only trying to save a valuable work of art . There are other possessions about the house which you should be giving your attention to , as Lora has pointed out . " Morgan seemed to go suddenly limp , and he pushed her aside easily , reached toward the picture with his knife . Lora ran to help him . " Here  --  I 'll push this desk over . Then I can stand on it and reach the higher part of the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give me the knife . " There was surprise in the look Wade turned upon her , but he handed her the knife and would have helped her clamber onto the desk .  | But just then a shouting from outside reached them . Morgan started as if she wakened from some spell and ran out of the room . Something had certainly occurred outside . Lora tossed the knife onto the desk . " Let 's see what 's happened , " she said to Wade , and he limped beside her as she went toward the rear of the house . They stood at the back door together , watching the frantic scene in the yard . Flames were running up the ridgepole of the stable roof , hissing as the single stream from the firemen 's hose harried them futilely . They darted along the shingles , zigzagging downward , and the crowd in the yard watched the doomed building helplessly . In a few moments a fierce burst of light behind the panes revealed that the interior too was blazing . But now at last the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying out altogether and no more sparks and burning embers were being carried across the bare expanse of yard toward the main house . At only one point did the fire seem to have leaped across the firebreak . Along the rest of the line it seemed to be satiating its appetite among the stubble , burning itself out in black patches . Adam came toward them across the yard , streakings of soot smearing his upper body , his hair and eyebrows singed . Lora looked away from him quickly , standing very close to Wade . " You should have arrived sooner , " Adam said dryly to Wade . " We could have used an extra hand . " " I 'm afraid I 'd have done you little good as a helper , " Wade admitted . Lora could only turn a furious look upon Adam , hating the flush that rose in her cheeks . Even as she turned purposefully away from him , she knew that he had noted it and was amused . Now the stable and the quarters above were burning fiercely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflagration . Off to the left and right down the hillside the fire seemed to be dying out  --  balked on one hand by a stony meadow which had long been cleared of  | trees , and on the other by a road which cut through the woodland , edged for a distance by a low stone wall . Adam stretched himself upon the ground , looking really ill now and no longer able to stand . He fumbled with his shirt , buttoning it on , then folded his arms across drawn-up knees and leaned his head upon them . If he were ill , let other hands succor him , Lora thought , still angry and shaken . Wade touched her arm gently . " I think there 's no further use in staying here . We ought to get back to Mother . She 'll be worried . But first let 's ask Morgan if there 's anything else we can do . " There was a crash and a shower of sparks as the stable roof fell in , but now more smoke than flame shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morgan was nowhere in sight and they went through the back door into the house . Clothilde met them in the hallway , plainly distraught . She was a thin , nervous woman , dressed in black with a white apron tied about her waist . " Please ! " she cried to Lora and Wade . " Madame Channing does the so terrible thing . Please , you will go to stop her . " She waved them toward the drawing room . Lora and Wade went quickly to the door . Morgan had climbed upon the desk Lora had pulled before the picture and she stood upon it with her legs braced and the kitchen knife upheld in her right hand . She was hacking roughly at a space near the center of the picture , and the white gash above the knife showed what damage had already been done . " Morgan ! Stop ! " Wade cried . He went across the room as quickly as he could manage with his cane . When Morgan turned he reached up and twisted the knife from her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried , stamping her foot on the inlaid desk top . " You wanted the picture of Virginia , did n't you ? Well , I was going to give it to you . I do n't want it  --  so the thing might as well be cut in two . Then I can be free of the way she watches me . " Wade stepped out of her reach with the knife . " I ca n't stop  | you if you choose to do something hysterical . But it is n't necessary to ruin the picture . I 'd thought to save the whole thing , not deface it that way . " She stared at him for a long moment and then crumpled suddenly on the desk , her black skirts billowing about her . She put her head in her hands and began to sob uncontrollably . Clothilde , who had hovered in the background , ran toward her and began to wave a bottle of smelling salts near her nose . Morgan flung up her head and slapped the green bottle from Clothilde 's hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a moment the pungent odor was choking . " Get that away from me ! " Morgan cried . " And go ! Go away , all of you ! As if I had n't enough to bear today . " She stared angrily at Wade . " What do you know of how it is ? having her up there on the wall staring at me , blaming me ? I 've tried to hide her face behind those draperies , but she looks at me right through the cloth . Day and night . What am I to do ? What am I to do ? " She rocked her body back and forth in torment , her head in her hands again . Lora turned to Wade . " I 've seen this sort of thing before . Clothilde and I will manage . Please go home . We must n't keep your mother waiting any longer . I 'll follow as soon as I can . " Morgan 's state was quite evidently something Wade was glad to escape . " Do n't stay too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Lora took Morgan 's arm firmly . " We 're going to get you to bed now . A good sleep will make you feel better . Come along with us . " The quiet , authoritative tones of adult to child seemed to have some effect . Morgan sobbed convulsively , but she slipped obediently from the desk . Lora silenced Clothilde 's clucking with a glance and put her arm about Morgan 's waist , led her quietly from the room . Adam stood in the hallway , leaning against the newel post as if he needed to cling to something to stay erect . But Lora had no interest in a second patient .  | When he would have spoken she shook her head at him sternly and it was likely that Morgan , her handkerchief to her eyes , did not even notice him as Lora led her up the stairs . When Morgan had been undressed and given hot milk to drink , she lay back upon the pillows and closed her eyes . The hysteria had gone out of her and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help settle the servants into temporary quarters in the big house and to summon Morgan 's father here . Then only the two of them were together in the darkened room . Discovering that it was afternoon and she was growing hungry , Lora had accepted the glass of milk and thick slices of homemade bread and jam Clothilde took time to bring her . She ate now and watched Morgan drowsing in the big bed . But Morgan was not asleep . Once her heavy lids fluttered open and she stared at Lora . " Why are you being kind to me ? " she demanded . " You need me , " Lora said simply . She smiled , attempting to keep her tone light . " Adam says I can never keep away from anyone who needs me . " A faint light of interest sparked into the dark gaze . " I saw you kissing him this morning  --  down there at the far corner of the yard . " Lora said nothing . There were no words which would place the blame on Adam and exonerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan had not seen what happened . " I do n't blame you for turning elsewhere . Not with Wade for a husband . Why do I still want him , Lora ? Why should I fight anyone to get him when I know he 's not worth it ? " " Be quiet , " Lora said . " Do n't say things you 'll be sorry for . Things that are n't true . You do n't want Wade , and I 'm not turning to Adam . Go to sleep . " Morgan 's eyes closed and she lay very still . When Ambrose came quietly into the room she did not stir or open her eyes . Lora put her finger to her lips .  | " I 'll stay a while , " he whispered . " But I think she 'll be right enough now . " Lora thanked him with a smile and made her escape . Downstairs she paused at the drawing-room door and looked in . The desk had been returned to its accustomed place and the green velvet curtain hid Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan 's knife had cut through the canvas . Lora sighed and hurried to the front door , inexpressibly glad to be free of the emotional tumult of this house . On the front steps Wade sat , his cane beside him , one leg outstretched . He looked up as she came down the steps . " I 've been waiting for you , " he said .  | WADE GOT TO HIS feet unsteadily and smiled down at her . " You did n't climb that long hill again just for me ? " Lora protested . " Why not ? You 've been helping up here , and I came too late to be of any use . The least I could do was return after I 'd set Mother 's mind at ease . I thought I might see you home and keep the dragons in the woods away from you . " Remembering the betrayal of her own lips in the moment when Adam had kissed her , she winced . She could not accept Wade 's consideration as sweetly as it was given . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he offered her his arm as formally as if they 'd been going for a Sunday stroll , she took it and went down the steps with him . Her knees felt shaky and more than anything else she wanted to reach the haven of her own room , fling herself across her bed and forget everything in the oblivion of sleep . Wade spoke only once on the way down . " So Morgan is haunted too , " he mused . " I had n't suspected that . " " You mean you think she blames herself in some way for ? " He nodded unhappily , and Lora wished she had the strength and wisdom to argue with him . She doubted that Morgan felt the slightest self-reproach , even though she suffered some aberration about the picture . No dragons appeared in the woods and they made the rest of the trip downhill in silence . He seemed to understand her  | weariness , and though he could not know the mingled emotions which had swept through her that day , he sensed her need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Back at home he left her at the foot of the stairs and returned to his mother 's sitting room . Lora went up to find Jemmy waiting for her at the head of the stairs . " I wanted to go up to Morgan Le Fay 's ! " he cried . " I wanted to see the fire , but Grandmother would n't let me . She said I 'd be in the way . Is Hamlin all right , Lorie ? " " Quite all right , Jemmy , and you 'd better not go there today . It 's all over anyway and everyone is tired and busy . You can go up tomorrow and see what has happened . " He leaned toward her , sniffing as she reached the top step . " You smell real strong of smoke . Was it scary , Lorie ? Tell me about it . Papa shut me out when he came back to tell Grandmother . She said it was too exciting for me . But I like excitement . " " Of course , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't good for them . But now I need to get a warm bath and lie down for a while , Jemmy . I 'm so tired and my head hurts . Tomorrow I 'll tell you all about everything , and that 's a promise . " Any appeal to his sympathy always reached him , and Jemmy pleaded no further . Lora undressed and bathed herself from head to toe in the zinc-lined tub in the bathroom . She brushed her long hair to bright luster and rubbed her head roughly with a towel , striving to be rid of the sickening odor of smoke . Then she closed the shutters in her room and got limply into bed . There could hardly be a more grateful moment in life , she thought languidly , than the first instant of consigning a weary body to the softness of a feather mattress , the moment of relaxing mind and body , of surrendering as quickly as possible to sleep . For a little while the events of the day flashed in muddled sequence through her mind . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a long while her sleep was so deep that it did not seem that she dreamed at all . But when her consciousness hovered near waking she had an awareness of the passage of time . When she lifted her heavy lids she found the room dark except for a faint glow of moonlight edging the shutter slats . She had slept into the night . She blinked the heaviness from her eyes and they became gradually accustomed to the gloom . Something in the room was changed , was not as usual . She turned on her side , the better to see the shadowy bulk not far from her bed . A rocker creaked and she came widely awake . There was someone in the nearby chair , watching , waiting for her to waken . " Jemmy ? " she inquired softly . The figure in the chair moved and threw aside a quilt which had wrapped it . " Not Jemmy , " Wade said . He went to her dresser for a candle , and she closed her eyes for a moment against the sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to his chair and was rocking gently back and forth . The candle flame made only a small aura of illumination behind him . It left his figure in shadow , faintly outlined , his face invisible . The senseless flashing in her mind had ceased . She was quiet now and there was peace . He is my husband , she thought . I do not want to be angry with him , or to pity him , or to condemn him . I want only to learn to love him . This was a thought so strange that she could only wonder at it . Oddly , it carried no sense of disloyalty to an old love . The girl she had been in the past would always belong to Martin . But that girl was a cocoon from which someone new had grown and the new entity was lonely and longed for love . Nevertheless , a desire for love was not love itself , she thought warily , but at least it gave her an increased tenderness toward Wade . " Why did you stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch while I slept ? "  | " I was lonely , " he said simply . " I wanted to be near you . " He too , she thought , and was touched . She wished she might go to him easily and naturally , as a wife should ; put her arms about him and her lips upon his in this new tenderness . But there was a shyness in her , a lack of certainty that held her back . She must not be betrayed into the pretense of giving when there was so little in her to be honestly given . She raised herself on one elbow . " What time is it ? " " Near midnight , " he said . " Lora ? " There was a warmth , a softness in his voice , almost an affection . She swerved away from it quickly . She was not ready , nor was he . Tenderness was not enough . " I 'm ravenously hungry , " she said . " I 've had only a bite to eat this afternoon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raid the kitchen for a midnight meal ? " He withdrew almost perceptibly , so that the thing which had been there a moment before was gone . But he was not resentful , despite his withdrawal . There was still kindness in his tone . " Of course we can . I 'm hungry too . Here  --  let me get your wrapper . " He brought it for her from the wardrobe . Not her old , worn one , but the feminine gown of pale blue which had been his gift , opened days after the unhappy fiasco of Christmas and never worn . Now she slipped it on and let him bring her the blue slippers he had given her to match . " There ! " he said . " You look frivolous now , and small and helpless . " " And you 'd like me that way ? " Lora could not resist the challenge . He had moved toward the door , the candle in his hand . Its yellow flame gave his face a golden warmth , as if the gray cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head at her , smiling . " Only if frivolous and helpless is what you are , " he said . " I 'd like to know you as you are , Lora . " She followed him into the hall without answering , while  | he lighted her way . There was danger in this new softening toward her . Because she felt suddenly guilty , she tried to make their midnight meal a gay adventure . They closed the kitchen door with secret laughter , lest they waken his mother , and behind the shutters they lighted only candles , lest one of the servants see brighter lamplight and come to investigate . There was cold chicken left from dinner in the icebox , and a bowl of potato salad . She poured glasses of rich milk , dipped that very morning from the huge cans brought around by the milk cart . Lora ate hungrily , while Wade nibbled a bite here and there without the appetite he had claimed . " Did you get Morgan quieted after I left ? " he asked , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gay . " We had no trouble , " Lora told him . " I put on my schoolmarm manner and she turned right into a weepy child and did what I told her to do . She went to sleep almost at once . " " No more accusations or dramatics ? " Lora considered the question and decided on frankness . There had been too much of secrecy and subterfuge in this house . " She blurted out that she still wanted you and would fight anyone for you . " Wade flung down his napkin . " Why must she always want whatever is denied her ? Even as a child , the thing over which she was balked was the thing she must have . There 's no affection in her feeling toward me , not even liking . She had only contempt for me , really . And I dislike her heartily . " Lora bit the last speck of meat from a chicken leg and wiped her fingers free of grease . " Since we 're being truthful with each other tonight , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " he said ruefully . " You 're thinking of that time in the woods when Jemmy saw us . You want to know why ? " She nodded . " That 's the one thing that does n't fit any pattern I can find for you . You would never have turned away from Virginia . " i He made a quick , despairing gesture . " No , I would not , " he said . " And yet ? "  | And yet ... Lora thought , remembering Adam . " I 'll try to tell you what happened , " he said , and there was sudden urgency in his voice . " Do you know that there was a time when I might have married Morgan ? " " I know . And your mother has told me about that day when Morgan struck at her with the curling iron . " He winced . " She is so many things  --  Morgan . Anything is possible . Just as anything is possible with my mother . Even now I do not know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in the woods in the quiet , gentle way she sometimes used to adopt as a child and which always appealed to me . She grasped at nothing , asked for nothing , except that I listen . Then she told me that she had never struck my mother that day . Mother had come to upbraid her and threaten her , but though Morgan was angry , she said she did nothing at all but listen . " " What of the burn across your mother 's hand ? " " She told me she 'd tried to go on curling her hair and had picked up the hot iron when Mother suddenly darted toward her and grasped it with her bare hand . Then Mother screamed for help and when I came she made her accusations against Morgan . And she had a burned hand to prove it . " " But if what Morgan says is true , why did n't she speak up at the time ? " Wade shook his head wearily . " She knew no one would believe her . It was Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing violent , unpredictable things . I could remember how queerly proud and quiet Morgan was at the time , offering no defense of any kind , but constantly accusing me with her eyes . And I did n't understand . " " She could still be lying , " Lora said . " She had an air of honesty about her . She spoke quietly and simply . In a sense not like herself at all . It seemed to me that she was telling the truth and that we had both been bitterly tricked by my mother . She was crying when she finished telling me , and somehow all my old feeling for her came back and I held her close to me and kissed her . "  | He was silent and Lora reached across the table to touch his hand comfortingly . " But later of course Morgan became her old self again and tried to use that moment to reinstate her.self with me . After Virginia 's death . I could only feel repelled by her then . By that time I knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my arms for those few moments . I told Morgan that I wanted nothing more to do with her . Lora , you know that I truly loved Virginia ? " Lora nodded . She knew indeed . " But your mother ? If this is true then she did as terrible a thing as she accused Morgan of doing . " " She believed she was saving me from great injury . Perhaps she was . But I knew I had to escape from her after that . My need for escape was one reason for my enlisting . During those months away I promised myself a hundred times that if ever I returned it would be as my own man , owning my own soul . " " You are your own man now , " Lora said softly . He went to the kitchen door and pulled it open , and she rose and stood beside him . The moon stared palely through a thin veiling of cloud and the April night was mild , with only a touch of sea chill to it . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Spring ! " he whispered . " You can almost hear things growing , getting ready to surprise us in the morning . " " Do you feel that too ? " she said , both touched and surprised . She had not dreamed that his thoughts could turn along such lines . How little she knew him really . He drew a full deep breath that swelled his lungs . " It makes me feel the way I used to as a little boy . As if something mysterious was ahead of me . I can remember a place where the spring sun used to warm a broken wall in the old Hume house . I 've gone there sometimes to sit alone and feel myself part of the growing . Part of every living thing . " She leaned her cheek against his arm for just a moment because there were no words to give him . She could love that  | little boy he had once been just as she could love jemmy . He traced the curve of her cheek with his fingers and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enough of this mooning in the back yard . Back to bed with you . Ellie will never get over it if she sees us here . " They laughed together lightly and hurried inside to put things away , conceal all evidence of their repast . If Ellie found some of her chicken gone tomorrow , she could think what she liked , but at least they would leave no betraying signs . Together they went upstairs , their shadows marching tall beside them in the candlelight . He saw her to the door of her own room and for a moment her breath quickened with the beat of her heart . But he said good night as politely as if he were some swain bringing her home from a ball , and went away to his own room and his own bed . As she blew out her candle and returned to her rumpled sheets , an unwanted memory forced itself into her mind . The memory of Adam 's mouth demanding upon her own  --  unwelcome , but asking no permission , unafraid of her refusal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she lay in the dark . She had no wish to think of Adam ? yet there the thought of him was , strong and clear as the feel of his mouth had been . And there was no will in her to put the thought away . What would happen if Wade should take her like that  --  not gently asking her assent , but claiming as a right ? She did n't know . She could n't tell . The following week saw May blooming full and green across the island . Already forsythia and crocus were gone and dandelion heads were turning white . Along the lane the dogwood blossoms which gave the road its name burst into white magic , and a delicate scent of apple blossom laced through the dank harbor smell that blew across the island . But now the surging of anticipation , of energy , like sap coursing through green things , had given way to a certain  | languor , which too was part of spring . For Jemmy it meant doses of sulphur and molasses which he detested and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restlessness that drove him into trips about the island  --  but whether these were in the interest of the Circle Lora did not know . Sometimes he sat for long hours at the desk in the library , but whether he strove again to write he did not say . And the desk was always carefully locked when he left the room . Not again had there come such a moment of sympathy between them as on the night of Morgan 's fire . Today was so warm that Mother Tyler had asked to be wheeled outdoors . Peter had made a small wooden ramp which he placed against the rear veranda and down this he wheeled her chair . In the garden green sprouts were already piercing the brown earth and Lora had found some satisfaction and release for her own energies in either working with Ambrose when he came to tend the garden , or alone when he could not come . Morgan 's stables were being rebuilt and Ambrose often lent a hand , or a supervisory eye . This morning Mrs. Tyler sat in the shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle in her lap , her eyes observing Lora as she knelt to work with trowel and gloves , digging the scourge of dandelions out of struggling grass . Rebecca had gone back to work for Morgan a few days before , though somewhat uncertainly and fearfully . And now that Lora had seen in Morgan the transformation of a supposedly poised woman to a tantrum-throwing child , she could understand Rebecca 's uneasiness . Lora had seen the girl yesterday and Rebecca had said in her veiled way that everything was fine . Even now she did not accept Lora 's interest with complete trust . What had happened about the man she had been seeing , or how important he was in Rebecca 's eyes , Lora had no way of knowing . John Ambrose had told her that Morgan had no inkling of that matter and it was better if she did not know about it for the time being . But if Rebecca had to steal away secretly for visits to McKeon Street , her position with Morgan would not be too secure .  | Lora dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pried up an offending plant , her thoughts coming nearer to home . Only this morning before he had gone to school , Jemmy had looked at her with reproachful eyes . " I 'm not going to get my dog back , am I , Lorie ? Papa is never going to let him come home . I know . " She could not promise him outright again . So far Wade had resisted her every effort to bring up the subject . As far as he was concerned the dog could come back if she wanted to take the responsibility with his mother , wanted to work out the whole matter herself . Was she wrong , she wondered , in not taking that easy way out for Jemmy 's sake ? It was beginning to seem that Wade would never make the step of his own free will . He wanted only to be let alone . When opposing individuals began to put pressure on him his one instinct seemed to be toward escape  --  not toward fighting the matter out with one or the other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mother Tyler suddenly , " ? the way you 're frowning and pursing your mouth ! " Lora gave a resisting dandelion plant an energetic tug and sat back on the grass , dropping her trowel and stripping off her gloves . " I did n't realize I was giving myself away . But you 're sight . I was arguing with Wade just then . About Jemmy 's dog . " " That matter was settled long ago , " Mother Tyler snapped . " I 'm sorry , " said Lora quietly , " but it was not . I told Jemmy at the time that I would get his dog back for him . And Wade has given me permission to do so if I manage the whole thing myself . " She looked up at the old lady with a challenge in her eyes . " He means that I must take all the blame and responsibility when you have an accident or take to your bed again . " The woman in the wheel chair stared in astonishment . " What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lora said , looking away from her , " it 's too warm a day to get angry . In some ways you are a very honest woman  | and I admire you . But you are n't honest about this  --  not even with yourself . " At least the old lady had learned that raging and storming got her nowhere with Lora . She had even begun to give the girl a certain grudging respect because Lora had proved an adversary worthy of her mettle . It was too easy to browbeat everyone else , and sometimes a little tiresome . " Very well , " said Mrs. Tyler tartly , " since I find myself helpless in this chair and unable to escape from the valuable advice offered me by a chit who is scarcely out of swaddling clothes , you may instruct me . " Lora rocked back and forth on the grass , her knees pulled up beneath her chin . " It 's not really you I want to be honest about , but Wade . Do you think we could both be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for a handful of months and I have known him all his life , this promises to be an interesting , if not informative discussion . " " I wonder if you really do know him , " Lora said softly . " Know him ? I know his every thought and gesture . I know his waywardness , his refusal to take the advice which would have helped make a man of him . " " A man in whose pattern ? " " His grandfather 's , of course . From the very first I tried to save him from his father 's course , tried to hold up to him the ideal that was Jason Cowles . But as a child he would twist in my very hands . And when I managed to extract obedience from him he would fail so miserably that I would wash my hands of him for weeks at a time . " " Do you really think any human being can be turned into something he is not ? " Lora asked . " I do n't believe Wade could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So he became the spineless thing he is ! " said Mrs. Tyler , and scorn cut through her voice . " I do n't believe he 's in the least spineless . He is trying to go his own way . He wanted your love and admiration very  | much as a boy . Why did n't you ever seek for something in him to love and admire ? " " As his calf-eyed Virginia did ? No , thank you . I see him as he is . For his own good . And now I 'll ask you a question ? what do you see in him to love and admire ? " Lora closed her eyes , rocking again . This was not something she could be entirely truthful about . Mother Tyler had long ago surmised the facts . What the old woman said now was intended to taunt . She chose her words carefully . " I see the things he could be . I see what is in him to become . " " Pahl Those were the things I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not . He is my son and I have an affection for him , my fine lady , in spite of your accusation . " " I wonder if affection without respect does anyone any good ? I would n't want such a thing for myself . Why should n't he resist an affection like that ? " " You seem to be running in circles , " the old lady said . " You wo n't have me change him , yet you talk about his becoming something else . He gives me nothing to win my respect , yet you talk about love being worthless without respect . Well , enough of this nonsense . Come back and talk to me in twenty years when you 've more sense in your silly young head . " Lora straightened and looked at her . " Are you aware that Wade knows the truth about that day when you grasped Morgan 's curling iron ? " The old woman was a master at controlling her features . She blinked slowly and started to speak , but Lora went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against yours . But this time Wade believes Morgan . So perhaps there is something lacking in what respect he may feel for you . " It was the first time Lora had ever seen Mother Tyler at a complete loss for words . She lay back in her chair and closed her eyes . In the merciless light every line in her face seemed deeply etched . Lora got up and dusted the bits of earth and grass from  | her skirts . Then she came over and stood beside the old lady 's chair . " All these things are long in the past and should be forgotten . It is now that matters . I want to help Wade . And I want to help you and Jemmy too . Right now , you . Come ? take my hands and walk a few steps . Two steps , three , six ? no more . You stand every day when you get into that chair . You can learn to walk alone if you try . " She held out her hands while the old woman stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am pretending this injury ? The Lord has seen fit to punish me with this affliction and I can only be resigned to His will . " " I do n't believe that , " Lora said . " But I do believe He 'd help you if you tried to help yourself . You 've let your muscles grow too weak to hold you , but there is still muscle control there . . . if we begin to exercise it every day it will increase . Come now  --  I wo n't let you fall . " Mother Tyler slapped her hands away and pouted like a child . " I 'll do nothing of the kind . Go get me a glass of water , if you please . " " That is changing the subject , " said Lora . " I will get your water in a moment . If you know Wade so well , what is it that he wants from life ? Tell me that . " " To be loved exactly as he is , of course . Just as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's what I 've thought too . I suppose that is really what we all want  --  every one of us . Morgan and Adam Hume and me . And you , too . It would be so easy that way , so pleasant . We 'd never have to look our faults in the eye , or do anything about them . But my father never thought that was good for anyone . " At least Mother Tyler was listening now . " Go on , " she said wryly . " This is most revealing . " A breeze stirred through the garden and Lora held out her hand to catch the drifting white snow of apple blossoms , then blew them away with a puff .  | " I ca n't go on , " she said . " I do n't suppose I 'm even thinking these things out for myself . I 'm remembering my father and the things he told me . But I ca n't remember enough . I think you 're still fighting some sort of battle that was really ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the war has long been over and that you can now lay down your arms . You 've only friends around you . " " What on earth do you mean by such gibberish ? " " You might even find here in your own house something of what you 've been fighting for , all these years . " " May I have that glass of water , or must I scream for Ellie ? No one ever brings out my bell when I come into the yard . " " I 'll get your water , " Lora said , and went quickly off . She returned with a glass of cool well water , clear and sparkling in the May sunshine , and gave it to the old lady , who drank thirstily . She looked so weary and old that in the merciless light every line in her face seemed more deeply grooved . Lora felt a little guilty . Perhaps she had not been altogether fair or kind . Mrs. Tyler handed her the glass . " Where is that dog ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the unexpectedness of the question . " John Ambrose has him up at Morgan 's . He 's been there ever since the day Wade had him taken away . " " So that is how his orders are obeyed ? But no matter . Get him back . Let the boy have him . I 've endured this wrangling and these reproachful looks long enough . " For a moment Lora could only stare in surprise . Then she reached out and touched Mrs. Tyler 's shoulder gently . " Thank you , Mother . But we ca n't do it that way . Not yet . " " Why not ? What do you mean ? " " I  --  I do n't know how to explain it . It 's just that I feel this is something Wade must do . He banished the puppy himself to give in to you . Now he should be willing to accept the responsibility of bringing it back  --  no matter what he thinks  | you may do . It must be hard for him  --  or there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're confusing me . I thought you wanted to see Jemmy happy . And I know what store the boy sets by that dog . I 'd already decided to see what I could do about the matter . I ca n't remember now what I was so angry about . Because you crossed me , I expect . But now you are holding back from doing this for the child . " " Jemmy needs love , but not coddling , " Lora said . " He 's really a very strong little boy when it comes to spirit . I suspect he 's like his grandfather Jason . Like you . " The old lady blinked and her mouth creased into a longunused smile . " What a joke on me  --  if that proves true . I 've always thought him a stubborn child whose will ought to be broken . " " I do n't think you can break it , " Lora told her . " Any more than anyone could break yours . But Wade is different . Not like his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he has bound himself to a wheel chair in a sense , just as you have , and goodness knows how we 're ever going to get either of you to see that you can walk ! " " I do n't want to walk ! " the old lady said . " Do stop chattering and go back to your dandelions . At least twelve new plants have cropped up while you 've been wasting your time . " Lora laughed and returned to her work . Behind her Mother Tyler closed her eyes and seemed to sleep . But once she opened them and spoke sharply to Lora . " Think you 're a clever one , do n't you ? " she said .  | ONE AFTERNOON a few days later Ellie came up to Lora 's room while she was changing her dress for dinner and announced that Mr. Norwood was calling . He had asked for Mr. Wade , but since he was not in , Mr. Norwood would like to see his wife . Lora hurried downstairs to the parlor and gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They both agreed that it was a lovely day and Mr. Norwood murmured several absent pleasantries . " I 'm sorry Wade is out , " Lora said . " But since it 's getting late , he should be home at any moment . Wo n't you wait for him ? " As a rule Murray Norwood was impeccably dressed and unruffled in manner . But today his shoes and gray trousers bore spatterings of mud , as if he had stepped without care into muddy streets . And there was a restless movement to his gaze as it shifted about the room , while his fingers tapped his knee nervously . If she had not been there , Lora suspected , he would have jumped up to pace the room . " I hope nothing is wrong , " she said at length . " You seem to be worried . " He looked at her then , as if realizing her presence for the first time . For a moment he hesitated , as if gauging her , wondering whether or not to speak . Then he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ridiculous move of his career . He has had Clement Vallandigham arrested . " Vallandigham  --  the man whom newspapers referred to p 300 familiarly as " Val . " The supposed leader of the Copperheads , and perhaps of the Golden Circle . Certainly a leader of the Peace Democrats . " What has happened ? " she asked . " What has he done ? " Mr. Norwood left his chair to move restlessly to a window where Ellie had opened the shutters , and looked out upon the drive as if to see whether Wade were yet in sight . " He has merely made a speech stating his own beliefs ? no more than he has been doing all along . " " I believe Wade said something of an order General Burnside had given ? " Lora began . " Exactly  --  an order for the arrest of anyone giving voice to seditious utterances . That is a scurvy attempt to muzzle all opposition to the Administration . Then to arrest Val  --  the man must be insane ! " Lora said nothing , little understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found release in words , went on . " This may easily mean civil war within the ranks of the North . I understand that Ohio is up in arms , clamoring for Val 's release . Burnside has handed the President a hot potato that he had better get rid of quickly . At least this may serve one good purpose . " He turned from the window and looked at her triumphantly , as if she had been ready to contradict him . " This may unite every man in the country who is against this war . It should roll up a tremendous opposition to the draft . " Lora was saved the need for an answer by the sound of the carriage on the drive . " There is Wade now , " she said . Mr. Norwood returned to his chair and attempted an attitude of calm . " Your husband seems very busy these days , Mrs. Tyler . " The remark surprised her . She had supposed that Wade was out on business of the Circle and that this man would know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army so long , " she said carefully .  | " There are a great many things to catch up with . " " Indeed there must be , " said Murray Norwood and bent upon her a look that was more than a little suspicious . She hurried to the door to open it for Wade . " Vallandigham 's been arrested , " she whispered as he came in . " Mr. Norwood is here to see you . " He nodded as he turned toward the parlor . " Yes , I know about Val . " She went in with him for a moment , then excused herself . Wade did not seem as anxious to see his visitor as Mr. Norwood was to see him . She felt uneasy about the whole matter as she withdrew , leaving them alone . Once she heard Mr. Norwood 's voice raised angrily , though she did not hear the words . And when he left the house he did so furiously and without any courteous farewells . At dinner that night Wade seemed preoccupied and sober . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vallandigham and she nodded emphatic approval . " About time ! Something needs to be done to stop that sort of thing . " " But if the government makes a martyr of him , keeps him in prison , " Wade said , " I 'm afraid it will only consolidate opposition to the Union . " " I 'd begun to think you were part of that opposition , " his mother said shrewdly . Wade shook his head . " I have never opposed the Union . Only the war . " After dinner he shut himself in the library again with the door closed . Lora sat for a little while in Mrs. Tyler 's sitting room and then went up to her own room . It was not yet dark and the clown doll she had brought down from the attic grinned at her from his shadowy place on her dresser . So far her whimsy in bringing him downstairs had led to no inspiration . His presence had provoked no further understanding of old problems which concerned Wade . Lora herself felt restless tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay idly in her own room . An idea which  | had returned to mind several times lately prompted her again and she went quietly down the hall toward Virginia 's room . She opened the door as softly as possible and stepped inside . The mingling odors of dust , long-dried rose leaves and stale air engulfed her and , moved by sudden purpose , she went to the side window and flung it wide . A cool breeze swept in , dispelling the miasma of disuse . She stood in the middle of the room looking about her thoughtfully . She was startled when Jemmy 's voice spoke from the open door behind her . " Lorie , what are you doing in here ? " She beckoned him into the room . " Tell me , Jemmy , do you ever come in here ? " He shook his head . " Oh , no . Papa said no one was to come in but himself . " Lora went close to him and put a hand upon his shoulder . " Have you ever wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning , " he said bleakly . " I did come in sometimes at first , even though Papa said not to . But she was gone , Lorie . I could n't get her to come back even when I touched her things and tried to pretend she was here . And it made me feel worse than ever , so I stopped coming . " " That was very wise , " Lora said gently . " I know you were angry with me that time when I wore your mama 's dress to the party , and I wondered how you 'd feel if we packed all these things away in the attic and turned this room into something different . " " What do you mean  --  different ? " " An upstairs sitting room for you and your father and me , " she said . " So we would n't have to bother your grandmother when we wanted a place to read and play games in the evening . Or disturb your father , or anyone else who wanted to work in the library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted only a moment . Then he nodded solemnly . " I think it would be nice . You know I got over feeling bad about you wearing her dress , do n't you ? "  | " I know , " Lora said . " But I 'm glad you 've told me . And I 'm happy that you like the idea of a sitting room . " " What will Papa say ? " " I do n't know . Of course we ca n't do anything unless we have his consent . But perhaps we can bring it up one of these days and start him thinking about it . " Later , while she was undressing for bed , she thought about it further herself . Wade had not gone into the room for a long while , as far as she knew . And after he got over any first feeling of shock perhaps he would begin to see how useful such a room might be to them . Of course she would take care to erase every touch of Virginia . Everything would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become truly a family room and if Mother Tyler wanted any part of it , then she could learn to get up here herself ! She was in bed when she heard Wade coming upstairs . His step still halted when he had to climb , but he moved much more competently now and was less dependent on his cane . He might always be left with a limp , but at least it now appeared that he would be able to move about with much greater ease . He no longer came to her room at night to talk to her when he was troubled , or elated , as he had once done . He had not been here since that night when they had gone down to the kitchen together , and had looked at the moon from the back door , felt the pulsing of spring in the air . She wished he would come in now and tell her something of the reason for Murray Norwood 's visit , but she heard his steps retreat toward his door and knew he would not . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was involved . And his withdrawal left her with a small ache besides . In the beginning he had clung to her far more than he did now . And though she had wanted him to find independence and had resisted and resented the way he tried to substitute her in his mind for Virginia , she wished now that he might come a little further along the road of friendship that had seemed for a  | time to be developing between them . She could not help wondering what had happened to stop that growth . Saturday morning she began to toy with the idea of broaching the subject of the upstairs sitting room to Wade . True , he still seemed preoccupied with his own affairs , and no little worried  --  as he had been ever since Murray Norwood 's visit . He followed the papers eagerly for further word of the Vallandigham affair . The government still held its " hot potato " ; and out in Dayton City there had been rioting and a newspaper office had been burned down by rabid Copperheads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly every day , and often the rest of the time he worked in the library . But still she thought she might try to reach him in this matter . At breakfast , however , there had been a distracting scene between Wade and his mother . Mrs. Tyler had demanded outright that he tell her what he was doing , what momentous affairs  --  her tone was sarcastic  --  he was involved in . Wade had said quietly that she would know in good time . But now he must keep his own counsel . His mother had plunged to the attack from a new direction . " You 've been gaining your strength back rapidly , " she said . " You get around with very little trouble now . And obviously you are going over to New York once or twice a week . It is time for you to make up your mind about the bank and let me know at once when you plan to return . Mr. Niles was asking about it only yesterday . " This time Wade did not hesitate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told his mother quietly . Mrs. Tyler made the familiar choking sound in her throat , but Wade did not move anxiously to her side , and when the old lady caught Lora 's interested and expectant gaze upon her , she rallied indignantly . " So this is the reward of a lifetime 's devotion ? This is what I receive ! " Wade pushed his chair back from the table , excused himself and left the room .  | Mrs. Tyler watched him go in dismay . " All his life I have lived for his good , " she said to Lora . " I have lived for him . " " I 'm not sure any one of us has the right to live for anyone else , " Lora said gently . " Well , between you , you 've spoiled my breakfast , " the old lady snapped . " Please get me back to my sitting room at once . " Since there were no longer fires on the hearths , doors stood open and Mrs. Tyler could wheel herself readily where she liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table to push his grandmother 's chair into the other room . He did not return to finish his own meal and Lora ate the rest of her breakfast alone in thoughtful silence . Later in the morning Wade emerged from the library in better spirits than she had seen him for some time and came out to sit in a wooden garden chair in the sun , while Lora hunted dandelions and weeds . His mother sat in the open window and he smiled up at her now and then as though there had been no disagreement between them . It was as though , while he plainly did not mean to withdraw from the stand he had taken , he wanted to smooth over his earlier sharpness . His mother , however , did not return his smile and there was indignation in every inch of her bearing . Jemmy had disappeared uphill some time before and did not reappear until shortly before lunchtime . His arrival was dramatic , and somewhat noisy , due to the barking and leaping of the little dog which accompanied him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought Hamlin home . He was rather pink about the ears , but very determined as he stepped onto the grass directly before his father , trying to restrain Hamlin with one hand . Lora 's heart began to thump and she could not pretend to be interested in anything except the little drama about to be enacted there in the garden . " I 've brought my dog home , " Jemmy announced , setting his feet apart as if to brace himself against any explosion which might come .  | Wade seemed the more discomfited of the two . " And who has said you might have him back ? " " No one , " Jemmy answered stoutly . " But he belongs here . He 's lonesome for me and I am for him , too . He lives here , Papa . " " Do you remember that he destroyed an expensive shawl which belonged to your grandmother ? " Wade asked . " He 's sorry about that . He wo n't do it any more . I 'll watch him every minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . " Oh , let the boy keep the dog , Wade ! I 've had enough of this ! " Wade threw his mother a look of surprise and relief . " Very well , " he said to the boy . " Since your grandmother has revoked her edict , you may keep the dog . But you will have to see that he gets into no further trouble . " The thumping of her heart quieted and Lora could only smile at the bright happiness in Jemmy 's eyes . Nevertheless , she was disappointed . Wade , after all , had taken no strong stand , accepted no responsibility himself . Perhaps , in the light of other matters , that no longer counted , but she regretted it anyway . " Papa , " Jemmy said , " do you know Ham 's real name ? " " You mean there 's more to it than Ham ? I 'm glad to hear that . I 've always regarded it as a singularly unattractive name . " " His name is Hamlin , Papa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were writing . " For just a moment Wade was taken aback . " By whose permission did you read my story ? " " No one 's . It was there on the desk , Papa , " Jemmy said , unabashed . " I thought it was an awfully good story . " Wade looked away from his son . " Apparently I was writing for children and did not realize it . " " Jemmy enjoys Scott and Byron and other grown-up authors , " Lora said quickly .  | " So a puppy has been named after my hero , " Wade said , and stood up . " At least that will give him some chance at fame . But see that the dog keeps out of your grandmother 's way , Jemmy . " He went up the back steps into the house and Jemmy stared after him for a moment . Then he went down on his knees and leaned his cheek against Hamlin 's sun-warmed fur . No one but Lora saw that where there had been happiness in Jemmy 's eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , trying to brush aside the emotion of the moment with matter-of-fact words . " It 's nice to have Hamlin back , " she told Jemmy . " And I 'm sure he 's very glad to be home again . " " Come here , boy ! " Mrs. Tyler 's words startled them both . " Come here to my window where I can look at you . " Jemmy let go of Hamlin 's collar , and the dog nosed into the grass on the trail of an interesting beetle . Stiffly the boy went to stand before the window , and there was defiance in his expression . " Why are you staring at me like that ? " his grandmother demanded , staring back . " I wo n't let Hamlin go away again , " the boy told her , his eyes steady and unyielding . " Who said he was going away ? Did n't you hear me say you could keep him ? But it seems that I am to receive no thanks for that . " " Sometimes you change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never change my mind about anything ! " snapped his grandmother . " Step over here closer , boy . Put your head up ! " He obeyed without speaking , stood motionless and waiting while the old woman 's eyes searched his face . Then she nodded as if she had come to a conclusion . " You look like your great-grandfather Jason . The resemblance is growing all the time . " Jemmy gave no inch of ground . " I look like you , " he said . " And I do n't like it ! "  | " Hoity-toity ! " said his grandmother . " A fine way to talk . " But she looked almost pleased . Hamlin leaped upon jemmy just then and the boy broke away to chase him around the yard . When Lora looked again at the old woman in the window she saw that she was nodding proudly . " There 'll be no meek bowing of this one 's neck , " she said . " He wo n't pretend to go my way and then twist around when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and never mind the consequences . That 's a Cowles trait , Lora . " " Do n't forget he has Virginia and Wade in him too , " Lora reminded her . Mrs. Tyler dismissed so unwelcome a truth with a flick of her beringed fingers and changed the subject . " What is my son up to , Lora ? What trouble is he involving himself in that he will not confide in me ? " But Lora could only shake her head , having no answer to that herself . In this one thing  --  their concern over what Wade was doing  --  she and Mother Tyler were closely allied .  | THROUGH MAY AND JUNE events seemed to be boiling toward some climax as far as the war was concerned . The lethargy and hopelessness of the winter was past and armies were stirring , moving toward great events . Clement Vallandigham had been tried by a military court , and sentenced to imprisonment . Indignantly the people of Ohio were offering his name for governor of that state . Lincoln , still wary of holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Val 's sentence to expulsion to the South , with orders that he be rearrested if found behind Union lines . With the help of Confederate authorities Val had found his way into Canada , and the excitement swirled behind him like the wake of a surging battleship . Early in June the Peace Democrats held a great mass meeting in New York under the auspices of former Mayor Fernando Wood . The crowd overflowed Cooper Union , shouting for peace and urging Democrats everywhere to denounce and repudiate the war . A resolution was passed denouncing the war as illegal and unconstitutional . All the while , the day of the intended draft came closer . There were rumors now that Lee intended a march into Union territory and everyman was needed . On June 8 instructions were issued for the enrollment of men between the ages of twenty and forty-five , but this was only a preliminary to the actual draft . Yet June on Staten Island bloomed on as usual , lavish and drowsy . Sunshine warmed the hills and bees hummed through  | clover , ignoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the island . One lazy afternoon somewhat past the middle of June , Lora came outside , crisp and cool in blue muslin , carrying a small parcel wrapped in an old shawl . From the road before the Hume house she glanced hastily in either direction , then ducked beneath shielding branches and ran lightly up the steps that led nowhere . She knew the way very well by now and with a clear sky overhead there were no fingers of fog to intercept or confuse . She went at once to what had become a favorite nook  --  a place where broken walls met in a corner and a growth of trees and shrubbery threw patches of dappled shade . Here she spread the shawl upon the grass and settled into her nest . There was quiet here , with only the hum of bees and occasional bird songs to break the hush . All human activity from harbor and lower shore seemed distant , scarcely to be heard . This was a place for thinking , for dreaming . For a time she tried to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but her mind wandered and she put the magazine aside to watch a dragonfly darting and swooping nearby . But the dragonfly did not hold her attention either . She curled up on the shawl and placed the small pillow she had brought beneath her head . But she did not nap . Her mind was too busy turning its wheels , worrying its problems . What dangerous thing might Wade be doing these days ? Always he seemed secretive and tense , and he would tell her nothing . She had lost all touch with him lately and lived almost as a stranger in the house as far as he was concerned . He had wakened from his apathy and pain and no longer needed to fool himself . He escaped them all now  --  his mother , his son , his wife . Lora turned on her side and sorted out the contents of the bundle she had brought with her . There was the little clown , its pompons shining golden yellow in the sun , and the few copybooks from the attic . She held Jupiter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into a past she could not know , help her to find the boy who had once played with this toy . In the beginning she had wanted only to minister to Wade 's hurt body , to see the healing of his physical wounds . Later she had been more concerned with the healing of his spirit , feeling guilty because she could not love him when his need for love was great . But now he had hardened into a new pattern and seemed to need her in no way at all . And now she was troubled and confused , not even sure of her own thoughts and emotions . When she had finally broken through his preoccupation to suggest the transformation of Virginia 's room into something more useful , he had been momentarily shocked into awareness of her as a person . But the suggestion seemed not to upset him unduly or to cause any relapse into his previous unhealthy attitude toward the room . " As you please , " he had said at length , almost indifferently . But he would take no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in any way himself . She had begun somewhat listlessly to pack Virginia 's frocks away , to sort her possessions from bureau drawers and carry things up to the attic . Jemmy too avoided the project and stayed outside or in another part of the house when she worked in his mother 's room . Her own interest and enthusiasm for the preparation of the room died for lack of support and the work went slowly . Perhaps next winter when the room was needed more than it was in summertime her interest would return . Now one could be outdoors , or sit on the veranda of an evening . She felt almost as if she were marking time in some strange way , awaiting an event still in the future  --  she knew not what . Some turn in the affairs of war perhaps ? Certainly the promise of that was constantly in the air these days and on every tongue . If Lee marched into Pennsylvania  --  if the Confederacy were really as strong as that . . . She had not seen Morgan since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all appeared quiet in the house on the hill . The new stable and servants ' quarters were nearly completed . Rebecca went about her usual tasks and not even Clothilde interfered with her . Serena was busy as always and the social life of the island had whirled into summer gaiety . Wade could no longer be drawn into the sort of social affair which had once interested him . He was engrossed in his own work now , and had no time for frivolity . Nevertheless , Serena had been able to extract from him a promise to bring Lora to the first beach party of the summer season early in July . Serena pointed out the fact that he was allowing his wife to languish in cruel inactivity , and Lora remembered how Wade had looked at her quickly then , as if he had almost forgotten she was his wife . He had agreed readily enough that some break in the routine of their lives was a good idea . Since the day of the fire Lora had seen Adam rarely and , to her relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had told herself , they 'd all been keyed to an intensity out of the normal . When people were both excited and exhausted , almost anything might happen . She still resented his behavior and for a while was fearful lest Morgan Channing try to make something of it by gossiping . But nothing further had happened . When Lora saw Adam she simply avoided his eyes and since he did not seek her out , she did not know what he thought or how he felt . Nor did she care . She put the doll aside and sat up cross-legged to open one of the copybooks . She had read through two of them completely before this and found a boy 's school exercises and essays . But after the first page or so of this book , she realized that it was different . These passages were something Wade had written for himself alone ; they were , in fact , the pages of a diary . Familiar names appeared , references to Serena , to Adam , to Morgan and Virginia . In these pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as an account of daily incidents . All this seemed to date back to a time shortly before the incident of the fence .  | For a moment Lora hesitated , wondering if she had any right to read what was written here . If she took this book to Wade and asked his permission , would he take it away from her ? She had the strange feeling that some key might lie hidden in these pages , something which would better enable her to understand what had gone before and thus help with the present . If she went to Wade he might well refuse her the use of such a key . She read on and the summer day hummed about her , forgotten . The young Wade had written : Today Adam boxed Morgan 's ears . Adam is not a gentleman but I was glad for what he did . Morgan had teased Virginia because I 'd picked her to be on my side , and when Morgan pulled Virginia 's hair and made her cry , Adam slapped her hard . Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knows Adam is stronger than she is , or she 'd try to fight him . I do n't know why she has to be so mean to Virginia , who is only a baby , really . And another entry a few days later : Morgan is a strange girl . She is very clever and smart . More than people think . If she cared about her studies she could get better marks in school . But she does n't care about anything except being mean . Everyone says it 's too bad that she 's not sweet and docile like Virginia . When she hears these things she always gets mad and that makes it all worse than ever . She teases me too  --  only I do n't mind . Because I know what she 's like . At least I do n't think I mind very much . Sometimes her words sting a little and I 'd like to show her I 'm better than she thinks . I can be just as brave as Adam if I try . A month later came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today she brushed her hair and tied it back with a ribbon . She put her mouth into a smile and came out to play in a clean dress without any tears in it . She was kind and gentle and sat  | beside me while I was getting well from my illness . Today was the first time I could be outdoors . A strange thing happened . I do believe I began to like her a little . I suppose Adam would think me foolish , but I almost had the feeling today that it would be a fine thing to be really liked and admired by Morgan . The next entry was made the following day : Of course Morgan was only play-acting . This afternoon I was reading to Virginia up near the pool . I did n't feel like pretending to hunt Indians in the woods the way Morgan and Adam were doing . Morgan came out prettily dressed again , but when we settled down to read and did n't pay any attention to her , she pulled off her ribbon and tied it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . She was like a wild thing all morning and teased everyone endlessly . It was as though she wanted me to turn on her the way Adam does sometimes . But I wo n't strike a girl no matter how angry she makes me . And a week later : Today a terrible thing happened . Adam was up in the woods howling like a banshee . I was reading about banshees yesterday and I 'm sure they must howl like that . Virginia was on the big rock in the pool trying to catch a turtle , and I was helping her , while Morgan sulked on the shore . Virginia and I were very quiet , waiting for a turtle to come out of the water onto the rocks . When one finally did and I was just reaching for it , Morgan got up and threw a stone in the water and of course the turtle plopped back out of sight . I was so angry that I stood up and shouted at Morgan . I told her I 'd smack her good if she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would because I do n't want to be that sort of boy . But she jumped right up and came out on the rock to give me a chance . Virginia started to cry because fighting frightens her and then ...  | Here Lora found that the page had been torn in half . The record of whatever had happened on that long-ago day must have been destroyed by the writer . There were only a few pages left in the copybook and they contained nothing of any significance , did not mention Morgan at all . Lora picked up the last of the four books , but here again were only school exercises , with little of the personal revealed . The torn page tantalized her with its unfinished story . What could have happened that day which was so terrible in Wade 's eyes that he had torn up all evidence of it ? Had he really turned on Morgan at last , as she seemed to desire him to in her perverse way ? The sudden sound of a foot on the stone steps of the old house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expanse of grass and clover toward the crumbling wall and doorway . Adam Hume stood in the entrance . His rusty head was bare and he wore his usual jaunty grin that seemed intended to show the world how little he cared for its opinion . " So this is where you disappeared to ? " he said . " I saw you on the road some time ago and kept waiting for you to appear near the path . When you did n't I decided to investigate . Do you mind if I come into your parlor , Mrs. Tyler ? " He waited for no invitation , but jumped down into the space that had once been the interior of a residence and sauntered toward her , his hands in his pockets . There was no one she wanted less to see , but there was nothing to do about his presence unless she wanted to leave . She knew that a haughty departure would only amuse him , perhaps make him call her a rabbit again . So she stayed where she was , waiting , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunny spot for himself some distance from her and stretched himself on his stomach in the clover , resting his weight on his arms . " You have n't forgiven me , have you ? " he asked , smiling at her lazily . " You wish to apologize ? " she said .  | " For my improper behavior , or for yours ? No indeed . I enjoyed it a great deal . And I suppose it makes very little difference whether you are angry with me or not . Since in any event I am planning to go away before long . " She was surprised , and in the same moment strangely relieved , but she gave no sign . " You are going to rejoin your company ? " " To my regret , they will have none of me . No , I 'm going west where I can at least get into an active life part of the time . I 've a friend who owns a defunct gold mine in Colorado . Between us , who knows what we may stir up ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wish you good fortune , " she said politely . His grin had a wry quirk . " Thank you , ma'am.I suppose , in order to fulfill the romantic tradition , I should first lay my heart at your feet and announce that I am departing forever because I know you are lost to me . " " You are being ridiculous . " " The other choice would be to beseech you to fly with me . To leave husband , child , home and mother  --  to sacrifice all in the name of love . " Lora made an impatient sound . " Why are you speaking such nonsense ? " " Because it annoys you . Perhaps that is the one trait I share with Morgan Channing  --  I like to annoy people . " He got up and crossed the patch of clover quickly to drop onto a corner of the shawl beside her . " Do n't wriggle away like that . I sha n't touch you . " " I have no reason to trust you , " she told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing to leave him the field after all . He reached out and caught her hands to stop her , and now there was no mockery in his eyes . " You have every reason to trust me , though you do n't realize it . Because I like you , Lora . Like and admire and respect you . And these are things I have given to few women in my life . Perhaps I could even  | have fallen in love with you if you had been heartfree . As it is , I will neither ask you to fly with me in the romantic fashion , or promise you my brokenhearted loyalty forever . It is my curious custom to prefer a woman who will love me back . You , in an unaccountable feminine way , are dedicated to loving Wade . " The start she gave was involuntary , as was her manner of denial . She stilled her hands at once and drew them from his grasp . There was no need to deny anything to Adam . What he thought did not matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have n't accepted the facts yet , have you ? That you are in love with him , I mean . The response you gave me the other day might have led me to a further trial if I had n't recognized that it was made of the same flimsy stuff as Wade 's response to Morgan . But perhaps you did n't understand that yourself ? " She stopped struggling to collect her possessions and looked at him . " No , " he said , " you did n't understand , but now I 've put knowledge in your hands . My gift to you in parting . I suppose it will always be a puzzle to my kind of man  --  what it is a woman sees in Wade 's kind . Virginia , Morgan-and now you . Is it the mother in the feminine nature , the need to protect and build up and succor ? " Still she looked at him , saying nothing . Perhaps she could have told him , explained the comparison she was only now beginning to understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without heed , storming towers , flaunting conventions . To be loved by him might be briefly exciting and it was even possible that under different circumstances she might have been foolish enough to play moth to his flame . But now  --  by some whim of kindness  --  he had indeed put the truth in her hands and she knew well that he would never be what she wanted . There was a richer , gentler love in which a more fulfilling consummation might be possible .  | " When are you going away ? " she asked , turning uncomfortably from her own strange thoughts . " In a few weeks . Probably by mid-July . " The copybook in her hands fell open to the torn page and she turned to him suddenly . Adam , at least , had always been one of whom she could ask a direct question . " Can you remember a time when you were all children , " she began , " playing up near the pool ? I mean some one occasion when Virginia was out on the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Virginia was always after turtles and Morgan was always behaving badly . What do you mean ? " She went on hurriedly . " This must have been a time when something awful happened . Wade was there too , and you were in the woods nearby . Think back . I need to know . " " Well . . . there was the time when Morgan pushed Virginia into the pool . Could that be what you mean ? " " How terrible ! " " I did n't reach them till it was about over , but I heard Virginia scream and I got most of the story later . Maybe it was an accident , maybe it was a push . But Morgan had gone out on the rocks to see if Wade would really slap her as he had apparently threatened to do . And Virginia , who was little and could n't swim , fell in . So Morgan jumped up and down and screeched for Wade to jump in and save her . Only Wade had always been babied by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan , who could do everything , jumped in herself and pulled her sister out . I got there after it was all over and Morgan was blistering the air with her denunciation of Wade . Is that what you wanted to know ? " " I think so , " Lora said . She could understand now why Wade had destroyed his own account of what had happened that day . Rereading it later , he must have been deeply ashamed of his inability to help Virginia , and of Morgan 's harsh accusations . " Morgan was always a fool when it came to Wade , " Adam said . " Even while he represented to her the sum total of  | everything she wanted , she always had to speak her mind rudely . She was forever in conflict with herself over him . I expect she still is . I 'd watch her if I were you . " She tugged at the shawl on which he was sitting . " Thank you for telling me , but now please get up so I can pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He removed books and pillow from her hands and laid them on the grass . Then he took both her hands in his and looked into her eyes . " Believe me , more than anything I can remember , I want your happiness . Can you understand that ? Just this once can you believe , much as you dislike me ? " She looked into his eyes and found honesty there and good will . The impatience went out of her . " I believe you , " she told him . " Thank you , Adam . " He let her hands go . " Now I 'll help you back to the house with your load . " " No , please , " she said quickly . " I  --  I 'd rather go alone . " The old look returned to his eyes . " Ah ? We must avoid the appearance of evil , must we not ? Very well , I 'll stay here while you go . I can cut up through the woods and come down another way . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would not be riled by him now . She accepted his arrangement gravely , said good-by , and went out the broken doorway and down the steps . She walked the short distance home slowly . The thing Adam had said  --  that she loved Wade  --  would not leave her mind . It hovered , challenging , waiting to be accepted . Was it possible for love to come like this , stealing in unaware , while you went on believing that all was as it had been before and your concern for a man was no more personal than it had been in the beginning ? If true , this might be something to , fear and regret . She did not want to be hurt any more . She had had enough of pain . " You look like you 're sleep-walking , Lorie , " came Jemmy 's voice from the veranda .
