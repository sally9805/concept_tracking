OF ALL the riddles that make up American politics , the greatest today is Adlai Stevenson . He is a cautious man with great appeal in the expansive West ; a spokesman for civil rights whom the South ac ? , cepts as a friend ; a conservative among Democrats who is the first choice of the trade unionists ; the favorite of professional politicians who dislikes the game of politics . Stevenson is complicated , aloof and physically unimpos ? ing ; in no sense the traditional image of the successful politician . And yet he commands more loyalty and de ? votion than any man in our political life save one . To these riddles there are , of course , answers . West ? erners see Stevenson as a self-willed man , a respected figure in states notoriously free from party discipline . Southerners cast him in the Wilsonian tradition of the scholar in politics ? one again which is their own . Trade unionists prefer to work with an established candidate rather than undergoing the expense , the labor and the risks of introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional Democrats : " The time has passed , " says James Finnegan , Secretary of State of Pennsylvania , " when a precinct captain could swing his precinct by favors , or the force of his own personality . The people look at television now ; they vote for the face they trust . " And , with some reservations , they trust Adlai Steven ? son . The lifelong Democrat , the independent whose numbers grow each year , the indifferent who voted for Ike because it was time for a change , lean to Stevenson today , believing that as he went down in defeat in 1952 , he raised new standards of excellence and honesty in American politics . Now once again Stevenson is a candidate for the Pres- idency . His nomination by the Democratic Party is prob ? able . That party , retains its appeal to the majority of voters , and Stevenson has risen in stature since he polled In the preparation of this assessment , The New Re ? public 's editor , Michael Straight , conferred with leading Democrats in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes . The national hero , who polled 34 million votes to defeat him , is almost certainly not avail ? able for a second term : So the way to the White House seems open . But the purpose of this assessment is not to speculate on whether Stevenson will be the 35th President of the United States . It is to ask whether Stevenson should be the 35th President , and to suggest tentative answers ? they can only be tentative , when one attempts to visualize a highly complicated wan in the world 's most demand ? ing role . The 35th President faces superhuman tasks . He must , as leader of the free nations , help to turn back advancing Communist influence in Asia and the Middle East which the Eisenhower Administration has failed to check . He must bring new vitality and purpose to our alliances with the West which , in the last three years , have fallen into sad repair . He must keep this nation ahead in the arm ? aments race and yet , over the opposition of the military , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we and they could accept . He must maintain the forward momentum of the domestic economy and there ? fore keep the confidence of business . At the same time he can not , as Eisenhower did , preserve a surface tran ? quillity by ignoring the mounting challenge of financial and industrial mergers , of falling farm income , of busi ? ness domination of government , of , neglect of schools , of roads , of slums and social services . The 35th Presi ? dent must provide more active political leadership than has been present under President Eisenhower , and yet , like Eisenhower , he must be the President of all the people , the guardian of national unity , the chief of state . These are the tasks that some man must undertake . And no index of his schooling , no catalogue of the out ? ward virtues he possesses , can measure his preparedness . John Adams was almost the equal of Thomas Jefferson in political philosophy , and in his contribution to the American revolution . He ended his term in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . James Madison was supremely qualified for the Presidency by every test of experience . His term in office was also a disappointment . Herbert Hoover , who attacked hunger and misery in Europe so masterfully in 1918 , presided over hunger and misery in America in 1932 , the helpless prisoner of rigid and irrelevant economic beliefs . Wood ? row Wilson , to whom some compare Adlai Stevenson , was a man of forceful intellect , of brilliant style , with a profound awareness of the Presidential role . He com ? manded respect and even veneration , but majority sup ? port he could not win . Democratic doctrine *naturally makes Wilson the martyr and Henry Lodge the villain of the lost battle to bring the United States into the League of Nations . But Wilson , by refusing to accept even the mildest reservations , by insisting that " the Senate must take its medicine , " by being as intransigent as the Irre ? concilables , bears also a share of the blame . In contrast , Harry Truman , who failed as a haberdasher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharged his great " tasks greatly when death thrust the Presidency upon him . In other words , a man 's inner qualities , which no stranger can know , are more important to the nation than the external credentials he bears with him as he enters the White House . First among these inner qualities that the 35th Presi ? dent will need , is an unerring instinct for the national priorities . For the President is the leader of the national march ; it is his task to prevent the nation from taking the wrong turning in pursuit of false or secondary ob ? jectives ; to perceive , and to help the nation perceive , the central challenges imposed by history during his term . Lincoln above all Presidents was endowed with this gift . " What Lincoln possessed and others did not , " writes Sidney Hyman in The American President , " was an artistic sensitivity to what the tension levels of the nation could support and what they demanded of the President . " He adds : This faculty can not be regulated . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious of itself , only partly con ? scious of the means it uses ; but it is totally aware of the objects it seeks out . . . . The faculty is shown in the President 's capacity to foretell the course of events ; in the problems he chooses to bring to the center of na ? tional attention , the time when he does it , the degree of gravity he attaches to the problem , the sense of las ? situde or urgency he creates when he defines alternative solutions to it . It is shown in the degree to which he is " a great asker and patient hearer of the truth about those things " into which he ought to inquire . There are two demands here upon the man in the White House , and the first is that he possess the insight and the courage to set aside false objectives . This is the critically important difference between the politician and the Pres ? ident . The politician must possess the ability to mobilize mass pressures ; the President ' must possess the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the people 's best interests may be at variance with the people 's will , and then , as Alexander Hamilton said , " it is the duty of the person whom they have appointed to be the guardian of these interests to withstand the tem ? porary delusion in order to give them time and oppor ? tunity for more cool and sedate reflection . " In this respect Dwight Eisenhower has been a weak President . He brought to the White House perhaps the largest fund of good will ever bestowed upon a Presi ? dent-elect . But he balked at the Presidential duty of expending some part of that fund in pressing for those parts of his own legislative program that fellow Republi ? cans resisted . Further , he abandoned to private citizens the task of halting McCarthy 's kind of lawlessness . Stevenson in contrast is plainly able and determined to resist what he knows to be wrong . As . Governor of Illinois , he recalls : I vetoed five of the nine bills passed by the Illinois legislature and included within the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I vetoed special-interest bills of all kinds calling for more than $40 million of appropriations . And I was solemnly warned in every case ? that I would , lose all of the votes of the groups affected . The positive aspect of the instinct for priorities is the President 's capacity to foretell the course of events , to select the key problem to bring to the nation 's attention , and to keep it in the national consciousness . In a curious- way Dwight Eisenhower possessed this faculty . He brought no important economic and social ideas to the White House . He set in motion no great domestic advance . Yet he filled the half-hidden role demanded of him ? to broaden the acceptance of 20 years of New Deal and Fair Deal reforms ; to permit ten ? sions to subside . His sense of priorities pointed overseas ? where he was immensely qualified by character , by personal experience and by the prestige he commanded to strive for peace . And this was what the voters , wear ? ied of war , demanded of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elect Dwight Eisenhower as President , " Paul Hoffman told a Women 's National Press Club audience in 1952 , " and the first is his capacity to win peace . " The audience interrupted , crying , " Stop right there ! " Yet Eisenhower 's gift was not a sensitivity to rapid change . In him , the lifelong characteristics of a rather inflexible man coincided with the passing needs of 1952 . Adlai Stevenson , in contrast , is sensitive and flexible ; more than Eisenhower he possesses that " capacity to fore ? tell the course of events . " Like Eisenhower he is weakest in searching out and clarifying economic relationships and trends ( and this is a period in which the most acute and eloquent of men carry few prescriptions ) . His strength lies in his perception of two of the highest priorities ? the relationship of the state and the individ ? ual and the part that this country is to play in the world . Stevenson is bred and trained to cherish individual freedom . The right of the individual to privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a platform for Stevenson ; it is a primary , personal necessity . It is part of his conservatism ? the genuine conservatism which distinguishes between respect for tradition and a rigid attachment to things as they are . Stevenson is further bred to take for granted the world 's interdependence , trained to look for ways of creating harmony between hostile nations . It was his revulsion against war that sent him back into public life to spend three years at the United Nations . His first undertaking after his 1952 defeat was to reacquaint him ? self with the world overseas . Many men may travel through 99 lands and because they ask the wrong ques ? tions and listen to the unimportant sounds bring back nOt one truth . The passages that are quoted from Ste ? venson 's Godkin Lectures in the pages that follow demonstrate that Stevenson , in contrast , has the rare capacity to be " a great asker , and patient hearer of the truth . " * * * If the instinct for priorities is first among the qualities demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . On the issues which the 35th President " chooses to bring to the center of national attention " he must have his own sound concepts of the course he wants the Con ? congress to adopt , the nation to pursue . Adlai Stevenson lacked these concepts in 1952 . Emerg ? ing under the aegis of Harry Truman , and standing on the record of 20 New Deal and Fair Deal years , he was forced to wage an essentially defensive campaign . His addresses in Richmond and Salt Lake were literary mas ? terpieces ; his lecture on political morality to the Town Hall Club of Los Angeles was a solid contribution drawn from his experiences in Springfield ; his speeches on for ? eign aid and farm policy represented the best liberal thinking then in print , his fireside broadcast of Septem ? ber 29 ranks as a classic of courage and eloquence . And yet very few of Stevenson 's 1952 speeches contained new ideas . Now Stevenson and his advisers have been at work for three years on a program for America . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suc ? cess . He has developed points of view on major domes ? tic issues which he will present between now and next November . On two major issues , of health and educa ? tion , he has outlined his attitudes in speeches that are quoted in the pages that follow . They set him apart from Republicans ? and from other Democratic con ? tenders . Dwight Eisenhower always gave education high prior ? ity . His three years in office have yielded one three-day conference , no more . The reason is that the nation is fully employed , and that to build new schools and to raise teachers ' salaries with the aid of federal funds would be " inflationary . " There is truth , of course , in this assertion . And yet
