By normal standards , academic or otherwise , there is little about Defiance ( Ohio ) College to attract distinguished visitors . It is a small ( 248 students ) , old creaking place that two years ago was hovering dangerously close to bankruptcy . But last week , Defiance played host to a man who had traveled 575 miles to lay the cornerstone of its new library . " I am here , " explained President Dwight Eisenhower , " because of my affection and admiration for Kevin and Ruth McCann . " <P> In the last two years , Defiance has come to have a good deal of affection for the McCanns , too . Since Kevin McCann took over as president in 1951 , the college has begun to hum with new hope . An industrial engineer who enlisted as an <P> Army private in 1942 and rose to become Eisenhower 's personal assistant* and biographer ( Man from Abilene ) , energetic Kevin McCann , 49 , has dedicated himself to the once unlikely proposition that Defiance can be put on the map . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had not been able to afford a new building for 35 years . Then the board of trustees began asking various university heads to recommend a man who might make a good president . At Columbia University , McCann read the letter addressed to his boss , and sent it along with a scrawled memo : " A good candidate for this job occupies the adjoining room to you . Will you recommend him ? " <P> At first McCann was on campus only occasionally ( he wanted to see Ike through the campaign ) , but he never forgot his duties . He turned the $20,000 royalties from his book over to a Mamie Eisenhower Scholarship Fund . He made speeches , sent the fees back to the college . He also began nagging some of his old friends for money . By the end of his first year , Defiance was out of the red . <P> McCann upped his endowment to $300,000 , increased faculty salaries an average $1,500 , persuaded Editor DeWitt Wallace of the Reader 's Digest to contribute a new recreation center , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes to print books of Americana .

Among his dreams : a new office building , a chapel , a field house , two dormitories , a $1,000,000 endowment , at least 300 students . <P> <P> - This week , Ike called Kevin McCann back to Washington as a special consultant ( mainly speech writing ) .
