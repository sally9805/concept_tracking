Like many other newspapers abroad , the Japanese press played the news from Arkansas with ill-concealed relish . But Japan 's most influential daily , Asahi Shimbun , pointedly reminded its readers that perhaps Japan is in no position to throw rocks at Little Rock . <P> Asahi devoted 10,000 words to the plight of Japan 's 3,000,000 eta ( literally : " very dirty " ) untouchables . The eta class , also known as hinin ( not human ) , includes most of the Japanese nation 's leatherworkers , shoemakers , butchers and slaughterhouse workers . Though the etas were formally abolished as a caste in 1871 under the Meiji Restoration and the word itself was removed from dictionaries , the prejudices that surrounded them survived almost unabated from the days when they were forbidden to pray at village shrines , go outdoors between sundown and sunrise , or marry outside their class . <P> Japan 's untouchables live in 6,000 more or less rigidly segregated communities . Commercial firms generally refuse to hire them , and when an eta seeks to " pass over " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide , and occasionally even murder . In Saitama prefecture one day recently , an eta suicide left a note saying : " Even in death I can not forget I am an eta . I hope I will be reborn in a better place . ' ' In Tokyo last year , an appeal for nondiscrimination brought offers from a number of small business firms to hire etas . But of 40 who were hired , all save two quit in less than a year because they were unable to stand the sidelong glances and open contempt of their fellow workers . <P> One who makes no bones about his own eta origin is blunt , 70-year-old Juichiro Matsumoto , a respected Socialist in the House of Councilors , the upper chamber of the Japanese Diet . He says angrily : " There are many eta people who have risen to top ranks in their professions , including screen stars and flower-arranging masters , but they dare not be frank about their origin because their popularity would immediately drop . But before we blame them , we must blame Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
