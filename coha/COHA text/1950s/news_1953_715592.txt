txt Gen. Alfred M. Gruenther , Supreme Allied Commander in Europe , warned Congressional economizers today " not to weaken our position there " by a major reduction in the $5,157 , - 232,500 foreign-aid authorization . He admonished the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives that such action might cause our Allies to " lose confidence in us " at a critical time . The General 's warning came as President Eisenhower took personal charge of the Administration 's effort to head off any broad axe treatment of the foreign-aid program by the Senate Appropriations Committee . The President began by bringing together at a White House breakfast General Gruenther and the committee chair , man , Senator Styles Bridges , Republican of New Hampshire . Then the President invited all members of the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign aid to breakfast with him tomorrow to talk things over , and asked the Senate committee for a similar discussion at lunch time . Several committeemen , Senator Bridges among them , have made no secret of their intention to cut substantially below the authoriza : tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Senate and House passed and sent to the White House yesterday a compromise bill fixing the $5,157,232,500 ceiling on foreign military and economic aid in the fiscal year 1954 . The measure forbids actual shipment of weapons worth $1,065,000,000 to Western Europe until the six countries concerned have ratified the treaty creating a European Defense Community . In the first official reaction . to this provision front a European source , the West German Defense Commissioner , Theodor Blank , told a news conference here that it would speed ratification of the European Army Treaty . Herr Blank had just completed a five-day inspection tour of military inikalla. - tions in this country ; " I am strongly convinced , " he Said , - " that the . treaty on the European Defense Community will be ratified within a few months . " : Western Germany 's is the only Parliament that has thus far ratified the treaty . It must be approved by France , Italy , Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg to become effective , but there is general agreement that all the others ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Bridges said after breakfasting at the- White House : " We did not discuss foreign aid this morning at all . It was largely a social session , although General Gruenther discussed with us the problems he faces in taking over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Command . " It was this command that General Eisenhower headed in Europe and from which he resigned to seek the Republican Presidential nomination . " The President apparentlyiwants , to discuss the foreign-aid matter ) at tomorrow 's luncheon , " Senator Bridges said . " I assume he will be asking for the full amount of the authorization bill . But I must say ' frankly that the temper of this Congress is to cut funds . " Mr. Bridges said General Gruenther would talk to the Senate Ap-1 propriations Committee tomorrow in secret session at his - own request , " so that he would discuss Europe 's problems with us very frankly . " In telling his story to the House Appropriations Committee today , General Gruenther warned that any major reduction in the **25;502;TOOLONG would contribute to a slowdown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Europeans to wonder " if We are pulling , out . " The . House session also was closed , but the general told part of his story on leaving the committee room . He said at one point that the recent evidence of resistance behind the Iron Curtain to Soviet domination certainly had been , influenced in part by the build-up of Allied military power . " These people have confidence ' in our strength and determination , " General Gruenther declared . He added that there was no evidence of any change in Soviet plans for conquest and that " this is the time to remain strong , not to weaken our position in Europe . " General Gruenther argued the lack of any change in basic Soviet policy from the fact that it had not altered its troops dispositions in and around Europe . But he said the Soviet Union now would be unable to start an attack with complete surprise . Allied strength was enough , he explained , to force an attacker into a sufficiently large concentration of troops to be spotted in advance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in Western Europe , General Gruenther said that , of course , people were listening to this Kremlin theme " because ' that is what they want to hear . " He added , " but they have n't swallowed it yet . " General Gruenther challenged a suggestion , that France and other key nations in Europe were " slowing down " in their rearmament effort . He said this was not the fact but added that " they have many grave problems . " He did not elaborate on the observation . While General Gruenther was appearing before the House committee , Admiral Arthur W. Radford , Chairman-designate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , briefed the Senate Appropriations Committee in secret-session ? 11 developments in the : Stitiggle against ' Communist aggression in the Far East . Members declined to discuss . his testimony except to say ' it- was highly classified . In the news conference held jointly with Lieut . Gen. Adolf HenSinger , Chief of , the Military Division of the German Security Commission , Herr Blank described his . reaction to his tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Army in a democratic country is organized and , led , " he ' said . As if in reply to expressed fears ' that the German military organi ' zation . to be built under the European Defense commonly might follow nationalist patterns that would further alarm France about the E. D. C. coneept ? Herr Blank ? emphasized that integration of . forces was necessary under the plan . He added : " Now we want to develop the idea that we all E. D. C. countries want to fight for freedom together . " He said Germany never would seek internal unity at the price of separation from the West and referred to the " will for freedom " recently evidenced through the uprisings in East Germany . In saying that he was " certain " of ratification of the defense community , Herr Blank declared that the forces envisaged foe Germany could be organized in two or three years . He noted that the problem for Germany differed from other potential members in that Germany was " starting from zero " while the other nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
