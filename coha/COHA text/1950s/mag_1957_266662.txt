Japan 's lean little Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and the U.S. 's bulky rangy Secretary of State John Foster Dulles have one thing very much in common : they both like to travel . In the eleven months since he took over the premiership from aging , ailing Tanzan Isibashi , Kishi has set a dizzying pace . Last May he took off for a tour of six Southeastern Asian nations , followed up with a state visit to Washington . Last week Kishi was in the air again , this time on a tour of eight nations , including Australia and the Philippines . In all his travels Kishi has stressed three major themes : 1 ) Japan is sorry ( for World War II ) , 2 ) Japan wants to help underdeveloped Asiatic nations with Japanese technical know-how , 3 ) Japan would be delighted to set up as the clearing house for a largely U.S.-financed $1 billion Asiatic development fund . Understandably enough , many of the nations Kishi singled out to benefit from these plans are suspicious that what the Japanese really have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military lines , of Tojo 's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . <P> Sticky Stop . Inevitably , the stickiest stop on Kishi 's latest junket was Australia . Kishi , forewarned that anti-Japanese feeling is still strong , was nervous and uneasy . His hosts surrounded him with armed bodyguards . " Sacrilege , " cried an official of the Returned Servicemen 's League at an announcement that the Japanese Premier would lay a wreath at Australia 's national war memorial , the Stone of Remembrance , in Canberra . But the league 's president rejoined sternly : " We welcome the wreath laying as a respectful salute . " <P> At a parliamentary luncheon ( boycotted by some Australian Laborites who refused to mix socially with the Japanese ) , Prime Minister Robert Menzies proposed a toast to the Emperor of Japan . " Well , " said one M.P . to an ex-P.W. : " I do n't suppose you ever thought you 'd drink to Hirohito 's health when you were in that Jap prison camp in Malaya . " The ex-P.W. grinned and drank his toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is my official duty , and my personal desire , to express to you and through you to the people of Australia , our heartfelt sorrow for what occurred in the war . " Kishi 's apology made headlines across Australia . <P> Fluttering Flags . In Cambodia Kishi was welcomed with fluttering flags and welcome arches , agreed to extend $4,000,000 ( in yen ) in economic aid over a three-year period . In the crumbling Laotian capital of Vientiane , sarong-clad beauties pressed bouquets on Kishi , and Laotian government officials welcomed his offer of $4,000,000 in aid and technical assistance . In South Viet Nam 's capital of Saigon , Kishi 's reception was formal and cool . Saigon 's politicians were miffed because 1 ) they hoped that Kishi would offer $150 million in reparations and help build a major dam for them , and he said not a word about it ; 2 ) President Ngo Dinh Diem sees himself , not Kishi , as the spokesman of non-Communist Asia .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
