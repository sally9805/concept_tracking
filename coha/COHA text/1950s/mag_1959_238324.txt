Under the long , lemon-tinted gown and the towering headdress of aigrette plumes , the tall , tawny body is heavier now . The warm eyes seem smaller , softer , in a face fleshed with age . But the quick , bright smile is as vivid as ever ; the remembered throb of her voice still husks the rafters-a rising , clear-toned shout . At 53 , Josephine Baker , the supple emigre from St. Louis who sailed into the heart of Paris on the high old tides of the ' 20s , is still a top banana of the boulevards . It is three years since her last " retirement , " but Paris Mes Amours , her new revue at the Olympia Music Hall , promises to pack them in as long as Paris has the price . <P> The show brings back just about everything that ever belonged to the girl who was the toast and tattle of France , whose sexy , banana-girdle routines led the Lost Generation through the rhythms of le jazz hot . There is a showboat Cakewalk , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times and of Negroes in Paris ; there is a flash of the old Folies and the new ballets ; there is Josephine doing a Gypsy ballet and " The Charleston Forever " in black gold-spangled tights . <P> The reason for her return is no secret : Josephine needs money . After World War II , after the excitement of helping the Resistance and the pocketful of citations ( including the Legion of Honor ) , Josephine opened an orphanage for children of all races and creeds . But her lavish experiment in international race relations used up a fortune of 300 million francs ( $600,000 ) . Josephine decided to go back to work . The sentimentalists who come to cheer her chocolate arabesques are the financiers of her mission ; they are also her accomplices in creating an illusion-that Paris and Josephine Baker have not really changed in three decades .
