High in the Sierra Madre range of Luzon , one bright , moonlit night last week , a small man walked across the white sand of a dried river bed and held out his hand to a young Manila newsman , and to Manuel Manahan , chief of President Ramon Magsaysay 's Complaints &; Action Commission . After six years in the hills , Communist Luis Taruc , El Supremo of the Huk guerrillas , was keeping a rendezvous . In good English he said : " Let 's get straight to the point . " <P> The point was this : " The people have spoken and have overwhelmingly elected President Magsaysay . It is for us to accept their verdict . . . The civil war conditions in our country must now cease and justice must reign supreme ... I am a Filipino first and last . " Taruc and his eight young Tommy-gun-toting bodyguards melted back into the jungle , and the next day every paper in Manila ran his appeal . <P> No one thought that Taruc had ceased to be a Communist or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy now was to abandon guerrilla warfare in favor of political infiltration . Taruc 's field commanders got down to cases with a team of army negotiators at Mount Banahaw , 40 miles south of Manila . They offered to deposit their arms in mountain hideouts guarded by their own men , and to surrender the arms after they were convinced of the government 's sincerity . In return , they asked a general amnesty and presidential clemency for Huks convicted of crimes . Army Chief of Staff Major General Jesus Vargas snorted : " Impossible ! " <P> New President Magsaysay gave the Huks four more days to come to terms or face attack . He appealed personally to the Huks , offering " a chance for a new life . There is still time . Otherwise , meet the full force and power of our arms . "
