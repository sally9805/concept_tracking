San Francisco was unwontedly hot ( 89 ) as 12,063 physicians streamed into the city last week for their biggest get-together of the year : the annual convention of the American Medical Association . <P> At the beginning , tempers were running as high as temperatures : hotel space was all mixed up , a fight was brewing over prepaid medical care plans , an uncomfortably hot issue had been added to the program at the last moment ( see below ) . It took the best bedside manner of some of the nation 's canniest practitioners to keep things under control . <P> New York members of the house of delegates launched a frontal attack on prepayment group practice , * with a resolution designed to : 1 ) forbid solicitation of patients by groups of physicians and institutions and 2 ) condemn the restricting of a patient 's choice of doctor to the members of a group or panel as a violation of " the right of free choice . " Talking tough , New York City 's Dr. Renato J. <P> Azzari announced that committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with even delegates barred . A California delegate fumed : " I 'd advise that you did n't kick anyone out . " Dr. <P> Azzari backed down , booted no doctors . <P> The Kaiser Foundation 's Dr. Clifford Keene promptly asked for an amendment to recognize that " freedom of choice " is satisfied where the subscriber elects , of his own volition , to be treated by a group or a single doctor within a group . That was the heart of the matter . Suave and diplomatic ex-President Louis H. Bauer saw the trouble that would be caused by the issue and suggested that the A.M.A. 's judicial council takes a year to think it over . The delegates jumped at the idea . <P> All it meant was that the inevitable fight between group practitioners and the old school , which insists on an individual doctor-patient relationship , was postponed . <P> Almost overlooked in the heat of these arguments was a farsighted proposal by Outgoing President Edward J. McCormick . Doctors , he advised , should stop charging what the traffic will bear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . " The time has passed , " he said , " when the medical profession can predicate a fee on a patient 's salary , or whether he is in a private room or a ward , or lives ' on the hill ' or in more modest residential surroundings . " <P> * Best exemplified by the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York , with 400,000 subscribers who pick a " family physician " from a panel of about a dozen in each of 30 groups , and California 's Kaiser Foundation Health Plan also with 400,000 members ( TIME , June 27 , 1953 ) .
