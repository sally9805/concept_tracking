One of the longest and costliest postwar strikes was coming to an end last week . In Pittsburgh 760 delivery-truck drivers and helpers belonging to Dave Beck 's A.F.L. Teamsters agreed to end their walkout against five of the city 's biggest department stores ( Kaufmann 's , Home 's , Frank &; Seder 's , Gimbels , Rosenbaum 's ) after 52 weeks of picketing and violence . Under the terms of a three-year contract , the stores agreed to an overall 8 wage boost ( to $2.21 an hour for drivers , $1.94 for helpers ) plus some fringe benefits . In return the Teamsters gave up a pair of choice featherbedding privileges : for the first time in eighteen years , the stores can use parcel post to deliver packages of 8 oz. or less , and management , not the union , will now decide when to put helpers on delivery trucks . <P> Under the old system , every package leaving the store had to go by trucks that had a driver and helper regardless of the size of the load . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales v. an 18-city average of 1.5% . When Pittsburgh 's stores refused to continue the system , the Teamsters struck . <P> Though the walkout failed to close down the five stores , it still cost dearly . Business in the stores slumped from 25% to 40% . As for the Teamsters , they lost close to $5,000,000 in wages and got no benefits from Boss Beck , who condemned their wildcat strike . For almost a year a third of Pittsburgh 's 1,250-man police force was tied up patrolling the picket lines , and the city businessmen lost an estimated $100 million as shoppers stayed away from downtown . <P> At week 's end Pittsburgh 's 760 Teamsters were still technically on strike . They announced that they would not man their trucks until all eleven other A.F.L. unions that had walked out in sympathy had also signed with the stores . But with the key issue settled , everyone expected the other unions to come to terms .
