Patrolman Forest Parkey is an instructor in judo at Cleveland 's Police Academy . He never learned to wrestle a baby into the world , but he had seen a standard birth-of-a-baby film a dozen times at the academy , so he was not much worried when his wife woke him at 4 a.m. last week and told him she had labor pains . <P> With a fair appearance of calm , he telephoned the hospital and the family doctor . He bundled his wife into the back seat of the car and started for Lutheran Hospital , twelve miles away . On the way they passed two other hospitals . Each time , Parkey shouted , " Shall I stop ? " Each time , his wife answered faintly : " Keep going . " <P> But a mile from Lutheran , Mrs. Parkey screamed . Parkey jammed on the brakes . " Now it 's coming , " he said to himself . He got in the back of the car . " I remembered everything in the film without trying . ' Lift the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth so it can start breathing . Then turn the baby 90 degrees to get the shoulders out . Then hold on . ' It came fast . When I heard a little cry I knew everything was all right . " <P> It took Patrolman Parkey just five minutes to deliver his baby daughter .
