txt Letters to The Times Trade for World Stability British Industrialist Asks for End to Barriers to Economic Cooperation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : At Wisconsin recently President Truman had much to say about the principles of cooperation combined with self-help , two principles that should effectively balance each other . In putting such principles into practice the President said that one of the United States ' most important tasks was to create a sound economic system in the world based on the elimination of barriers in the way of fair competition in international trade . The recognition of such principles will no doubt be welcomed by many of those concerned about restoring a normal balance of trade between countries . At the same time , as I have repeatedly pointed out , the need for an emergency measure like Marshall Aid is itself mainly the result of the prolonged ignoring of such principles of balanced trade and economic cooperation in the past . For more than thirty years the financial ' and tariff policies of the United States sabotaged world trade by repudiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange of merchandise or goods for goods between Britain , along with other countries , and America was rendered virtually impossible by unclimbable tariff walls and by insistence on payment for American exports in dollars and gold instead of by return exports of goods . Stagnation and Depression The result was a one-way traffic in unrequited American exports based on loans and accumulating dollar debts . When most of the world 's gold reserves had gravitated to the vaults of Fort Knox and the loans were withdrawn the stagnation of world trade reached a climax of slump and depression , from which America , with all her wealth , was among the worst sufferers . There is now a sudden realization that a yearly excess of exports over imports of more than $5,000 million ( apart from invisible exports ) simply does not make sense . The Under Secretary of State is looking askance at tariff rates still ranging on some articles from 40 to more than 100 per cent and urges further reductions as " an absolutely essential ' short run ' measure to stabilize American and world economy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,000 import items on which it is prepared to negotiate with seventeen other countries at the forty-nation trade conference in September . Although Europe 's productive capacity has now been restored , United States ' imports fell off in value during 1949 and the dollar gap remains disconcertingly at the same figure of about $5,000 million as it was the year before . Anything like this figure when aid ends would mean that Europe 's imports from the United States would have to be cut by half . Mutual Benefit What is the purpose of trade ? Is it really for mutual benefit and the promotion of peaceful human well-being ? Or is it for the - purpose of piling up power and turning the world into an ant-heap of industrial and commercial exploitation ? People might well sicken of " cold war " as the only motive for economic cooperation . Instead of cold wars against communism it might be more sensible to recognize that Communism is the symptom of a social disease , the disease of a sick industrialism and commercialism which inevitably goes on provoking the very symptoms it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of/ nineteenth-century industrialism in Eng/arid that Marx and Engels hatched their theories . Let us have free and balanced twoway trade . The mutually profitable exchange of needed goods for needed goods is the only basis on which real trade is possible at all . But unless it is to become a trade in evils instead of in goods it must be a means of satisfying needs , not of gratifying greeds . WILFRID HILL . Birmingham , England , June 9 , 1950 . Not German National Anthem TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : You print in THE NEW YORK TIMES of May 31 a report of The Associated Press which calls the German song " Deutschland Heber Alles " the " former German Imperialist anthem . " This is incorrect . The former German Imperialist anthem was : " Heil Dir im Siegerkranz . " The song " Deutschland Ueber Alles " became the German anthem under the Weimar Republic by decree of the Social Democratic President Ebert on Aug. 11 , 1922 . The author of the song is the poet Hoffmann von Fallersleben , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1848 democratic revolution . LUDWIG BAER . Forest Hills , N. Y. , June 7 , 1950 . For a Free Czechoslovakia TO.THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial " Prague and the West " of June 1 was a timely reminder of the urgent task which lies ahead . You wrote : " They the Czechoslovak people are Western Europeans by history , religion , tradition and culture . Moscow and the Czechoslovak Communists are out to turn them into Eastern Europeans of the Stalinist type . Our policy , and the policy of the whole democratic world , is aimed at saving Czechoslovakia for the West . The struggle must continue , whatever the odds and however great the discouragements . " I am certain that many of your readers will receive satisfaction reading the affirmation of your statement by the words of the late Czechoslovak patriot , Jan Masaryk . In his radio message to his people on Oct. 28 , 1939 , from - London , he said : ? " I may perhaps be permitted to recall the memory of my father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . He knew that our aim is to be a decent , fair-dealing and dignified democracy . lie knew that Czechoslovakia is part of the Western culture , bound up with it forever . He believed in social justice and in the freedom of the individual . " After reading this eloquent testimony for Western solidarity there is littla doubt who caused the death of Thomas Masaryk 's son : East or West . The editorial of THE NEW YORK TIMES , if backed up with proper action , may become the clarion call in a new struggle for democracy in Czechoslovakia and perhaps in other countries behind the Iron Curtain . NICHOLAS G. HAUNT . New York , June 8 , 1950 . Republican Party Dissidents Issue Taken With Their Views on Senator McCarthy , Voting Trend To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As an opprobrious " conservative , " may I take belated exception to Senator Margaret Smith 's " Declaration of Conscience , " as signed , among others , by my home county 's Senator Ives . Senator Smith 's admonitions apparently received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do these seven Senators represent their party and nonpartisans more truly and widely than Senator McCarthy himself ? Is n't it generally believed that without the Senator 's own particular brand of bold courage and persistence , communistic undermining would not have been so fully revealed ? Senator Smith believes the Senate should do some soul-searching , weighing its collective conscience as to " hurling unproved charges * " . The American people are sick and tired of se.eing innocent people smeared and guilty , people whitewashed . " But in the long , impeded process of sifting ' real evidence from masses of accusations and rumors , were not the end results far more vital to the American people than the possible " smearing " of a few innocents ? Objectives of Group Incidentally , Cabell Phillips , commenting in an article in THE TIMES , " G. 0 . P. Progressives Want Dynamic Conservatism , " further interprets these seven progressive Senators ' and signers ' demands as meaning that their party should head up to " compulsory health insurance , wider and greater social security , more federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In other words , the Fair Deal and its objectives hardly go far enough to suit this group . Mr. Phillips quotes Senator Ives in a speech at Wingdale , N. Y. , before the Young Republican Clubs as saying : " If we are to keep the Republican party from succumbing to the fate of the Whigs and Federalists * * * our party is going to have to begin to stand for things which will attract the voters * * ? * . " Do the voters of New York State share their Senator 's opinion as to what will attract them , say in 1952 ? Perhaps Mr. Ives forgets that in the 1948 race in which he became Senator , Governor Dewey received the popular vote for President . And since 1948 is the real trend toward more socialism , or is public sentiment slowly recoiling from that hopeless pit ? Aid to Democrats The Fair Deal has succeeded beyond its wildest hopes in pinning labels of conservatism and defeat on the Republican party . The attack on Senator McCarthy by his Republican contemporaries must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration . Is n't it about time for the Republican party to proudly don this conservative label  --  and then see what happens at the polls in 1952 ? A mere matter of geography determined the Presidential election last time . Meantime , those Senators who feel the public pulse and insist that more socialism instead of less is in the cards , and who decry men and methods which expose the communistic borers from within , should hardly be praised with effusion . For such just do n't represent the American people as a whole . HELEN S. WILLCOX . North Norwich , N. Y. , June 12 , 1950 . Promoting Tourist Trade To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : For some time I have been wondering why the New York newspapers do not do a " selling " job on our great city . Headlines are always about our troubles  --  room shortages , water shortages , Welfare Department strikes and dismissals , traffic congestion and demonstrations of all kinds at City Hall , in fact , any event that might discourage the visitors that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today " Selling New York City " is certainly a step in the right direction . I hope you will keep up your effort to " sell " the greatest city in the world . KENNETH W. TOMPKINS . New York , May 29 , 1950 . Our Confusing Traffic Signals TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Even a half-wit from below the Mason and Dixon Line can see that it is completely crazy to install traffio lights to flash green and red and then to install traffic officers to stand in the intersections and contradict the indications of the lights . But it will take a full-witted traffic expert to decide whether it is the lights or the cops which should be abolished . More power , then , to Lloyd B. Reid . ALAN F. RANDOLPH .
