ROUGH WINDS OF MAY , by Nancy Hallinan ( 425 pp. ; Harper ; $3.95 ) , is a first novel that leaps like a trout with lust for life . A canny angler , Novelist Hallinan , 34 , uses enough bait for three regulation novels : 1 ) the English family , full of cooings , cluckings , crises and crumpets , 2 ) the adolescent caterpillar sprouting the butterfly wings of maturity , 3 ) the Panlike pipings of Bohemia competing with the dull drill calls of middle-class life . Novelist Hallinan 's Pan is a fat , wheezing , believable genius named Jubial Kerr who huffs and puffs rude reality into Rough Winds of May . To the world at large , he is J. K. , England 's greatest painter . To the Kerr household , he is Fatuncle , a lifelong , irresponsible nuisance who only comes around to cadge money and food . When his 16-year-old niece Celia goes to pose for him , she meets a double man who divides and finally conquers her loyalties . On one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems like another Charles Laughton playing Henry VIII . But behind the regal belch hides the lonely and fiercely honest old artist . He mercilessly paints Celia in a cage , an adolescent waif trapped behind the narrow bars of parental thou-shalt-nots . At novel 's end , with Fatuncle 's help , she has flown the coop to become a woman-her own woman . Author Hallinan has written a fine and pleasing novel , even if her prose is occasionally more breathless than deathless . <P> A MOST CONTAGIOUS GAME , by Samuel Grafton ( 256 pp. ; Doubleday ; $3.75 ) , is a fast , offbeat little yarn about a magazine reporter who is handed a money belt with $5,000 and told to sink into the New York City underworld in order to write an expos . Both the underworld and the police promptly mistake Reporter Dan Lewis for a mobster from Kansas City . After taking a brutal beating , he is put to bed by a brunette bit of fluff who soon climbs in with him . Dan becomes a bodyguard for a gambling czar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . He all but forgets about reporting as he becomes infatuated with the world of crime - with its sense of power , its money that produces a kind of evil freedom , its masculinity ( " The deferential male is an object of derision to criminal woman " ) . Much of this first novel 's wayward charm lies in its passing epigrammatic remarks . Sample , on a TV M.C. : " He was a matador who played human beings instead of bulls . " On reporters : " They have , every two or three years , the satisfaction of being told to find the truth . . . This is why newspapermen are content to wear dusty gray suits and to have love affairs which are 95% conversations in the back rooms of bars . "
