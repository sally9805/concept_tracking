William G. ( for George ) Bonelli is one of the noisiest , most powerful politicians in California . A hawk-beaked , hail-fellow rancher , lawyer and onetime associate professor , " Big Bill ' ' * Bonelli , 58 , wears wide-brimmed hats and . when the occasion demands , a Phi Beta Kappa key ( won at the University of Southern California ) . He is also the boss of one of the most potent political agencies in the U.S. As chairman of the California State Board of Equalization , Bonelli supervises the tax assessments of big businesses ; as the board member for Southern California , he hands out all liquor licenses from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border . <P> Over the Fence . During most of Bonel-li 's 26 years in politics he has had some mighty angels hovering overhead : the enormously wealthy , influential Chandler family of Los Angeles ( real estate , publishing , TV ) . In his political contests , Republican Bonelli usually had the warm backing of the Chandler-owned Los Angeles Times . Last week , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . Bonelli changed his registration from Republican to Democrat , announced that he was scared : " Political , economic and social enslavement is being accomplished by the aggressive Chandler family through the Republican Party and its kowtowing leadership . . . The picture of this scheming Chandler family ... is frightening . " <P> Reasons for the big split were obscure , and there were a dozen different explanations . According to one rumor , Bonelli had cast covetous eyes on the governorship , but Publisher Norman Chandler , 54-year-old chief of the Chandler clan , thought that was going too far . Whatever the reasons for the falling out , the Chandlers drew first blood last October ( TIME , Oct. 19 ) with a series of articles in their tabloid , the Los Angeles Mirror-denouncing Bonelli and his " saloon empire . " Big Bill 's board , charged the Mirror , displayed incredible laxity in freely handing out liquor licenses to racketeers and political cronies for only $525 each , and allowing them to be resold at the going rate of $6,500 . Bonelli retaliated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chandlers had tried to get his board to rule favorably on tax matters affecting them . At the same time , the Board of Equalization rejected the Chandlers ' appeal of assessments on their national advertising revenue just 13 days after the Mirror series ended . <P> The charges against Bonelli were nothing new . Almost since the day he entered politics in 1927 as a candidate for the Los Angeles City Council ( with the blessing of the Chandlers ) , Big Bill has been battling accusations of graft . A wealthy man , he has boasted that his $14,000-a-year state salary does not pay his federal income taxes . In 1940 he was tried and acquitted , in a directed verdict , on 23 counts of bribery , bribe solicitation and criminal conspiracy . In 1951 he blustered his way through a stormy session with the Senate 's Kefauver crime investigating committee , forced Estes Kefauver into blushing , stuttering apologies for " aspersions " on his character .
