At 12:21 one afternoon last week , Dwight Eisenhower snapped erect in his seat at the NATO conference table , put on his glasses , and . in firm , clear tones , began to read : " We are in a fast-running current of the great stream of history . Heroic efforts will be needed to steer the world toward true peace . This is a high endeavor . But it is one which the free nations of the world can accomplish . " When he had finished , NATO Secretary-General Paul-Henri Spaak and Britain 's Prime Minister Harold Macmillan turned to him with quick , wide smiles of congratulation . <P> Truth was that it was too early for congratulations . The U.S. delegation had gone to Paris with some misconceptions about the temper of the rest of the NATO allies . In Washington shortly before leaving , Secretary of State Dulles had made it plain that he was counting on hard and fast acceptance of the U.S. plan to establish missile bases in Europe . Said he : " I do n't favor these so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight to the talk of new East-West negotiations that had swept Europe in the wake of Russian Premier Bulganin 's preconference notes to NATO nations ( TIME . Dec. 23 ) . " If Communism is stubborn for the wrong , let us be even more steadfast for the right , " he wrote in an article published in LIFE last week , and dismissed the question of a new round of East-West talks with the observation : " The areas where you can usefully reach agreement are quite limited . " <P> Question of Strength . In this mood , the U.S. had taken to Paris proposals that were designed above all else to increase the military strength of the NATO alliance . Ike earnestly insisted that " we should leave no stone unturned in our search for an agreement to end this appalling armaments race , " declared that the U.S. " proposes to increase the economic resources which we can make available to the less developed countries of the free world . " But what primarily concerned the U.S. was the need for intermediate range ballistic missile bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of State John Foster Dulles spelled out the U.S. plan . The U.S : was prepared to make available to U.S. General Lauris Norstad . NATO 's Supreme Allied Commander Europe , a stock of intermediate range ballistic missiles . Norstad would assign the missiles to any NATO member that wanted them and , in his judgment , had need of them . To give the missiles nuclear punch in case of war with the U.S.S.R. , the U.S. also proposed to establish stockpiles of nuclear warheads in Europe . But the warheads , unlike the missiles themselves , would remain in U.S. custody .
