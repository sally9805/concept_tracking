A wand ring Minstrel R uPERT and Lilo Grant had been expecting them all day . " With the three children ? " asked the little Polish baroness who came to play tennis . " But my dear what could I do ? " Lilo threw up her hands and the plucked ridge of her own eyebrows flew up too , underscoring the painted ones she shaped to her defiant fancy . " Oh I know , " said one of the other women , the corner of her mouth whitening for a moment in that knowing , stoic sense of iniquity into which even the women most indulged by men plunge , like a kind of atavism , when they are championing their own sex against some injustice of the other . " That poor thing never has her children under one roof with her . They 're always farmed out  --  someone takes this one , someone else takes that one . " " Is that so ? " somebody 's husband asked . " But he 's an able fellow ? " " Able , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilo indicated her husband , Rupert , as if to say , " Ask him . " But all Rupert said was , " Ah , it 's a mess . " He did not want to talk about the man who was to be his guest . Like all Rupert 's obscure loyalties , this A Story by Nadine Gordimer Drawings by Shirley Burke brought a little rise of irritation , like bile , into Lilo 's mouth . " Mess , all right . That 's putting it mildly . He 's had three jobs in five months . I mean you can go on being talented just so long . . . . People get a bit tired of it . Utterly irresponsible , utterly unreliable . " " So how do they live , for heaven 's sake ? " " They do n't , my dear . At least not the way a normal woman expects to live . " The men were laughing among themselves about something else . But the women remembered things they had heard , casual meetings . " She 's English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fat little girl ? " " Oh of course ! They were the people who stayed in the Elsburgs ' house while Cissie was away . " " Well , so 's he . Got a DFC or something in the RAF . " " No , a DSO , I remember , the same time as Nickie . My brother , that is . " Well , anyway . He brought her out to South Africa and went and had three children and never did any good at all . That girl 's never known what it is to have two rooms she could call her own . " " So they spend all their time living in other people 's houses , while people are away on holiday and so on ? " " All the time . She packs and unpacks . With three children , can you imagine ? " " I have seen this Mrs. ? " The baroness paused , the name eluded her ; she went on in a kind of detached wonder at the description of a woman 's life which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impossibility of herself being in such a position , but out of the barrier of language and background , as she might fail to understand the point of an English joke : " I have seen her at the club . Once she was dancing there , with that tall one ? " " Barron ? Barrow ? The Colonel Barrow , that 's right ? " supplied her husband , pleased that he had remembered an English name . " Oh poor girl , it 's a wonder ! She has little enough pleasure , heaven knows . " " Why , only last week ? " said Rupert in spite of himself . Lilo tried for the last sip of her drink , but it was an illusion of the bottom of the glass ; there was nothing for her to swallow . " She phoned up before eight one morning . I heard there was something funny about her voice . But you know , she 's rather reserved . " " Oh , she 's a nice girl , " someone affirmed . " Too fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So I did n't say anything , I simply called Rupert  --  she asked for him . So then she says to Rupert in her quiet , controlled way , ' Please Rupert , I do n't want to bother you , but I have n't seen Andrew since the day before yesterday , late in the afternoon . " ' He went to some club celebration that should have been over by six or seven . Would you ask at the club , if you happen to be there for lunch today ? It may be that he 's been there , or they 've seen him . ' " " How awful ! " One of the women looked as if she had just seen an abyss , dark and terrible , which , who knows ? one might have opened up under one 's own feet , simply by putting one 's foot down in the wrong place , smiling at the wrong man at the wrong moment . " So you see , my girl . " An affectionate husband patted his wife warningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the atmosphere of the room changed , as a mirror changes as it is turned in the light ; at once they were all easy with chaffing banalities . T HEY trooped in to lunch . " Cold , I 'm afraid , " said Lilo . " Without decent servants , hot lunch for more than four 's impossible here on a Sunday . Rosie 's off . " " Well , we 'll warm our blood with some red wine , " said Rupert amiably . " Excellent ! " someone murmured . Rupert called from the darkness of the cupboard where liquor was kept : " What 's happened to the other two bottles of Beaune , Lo ? " " Oh , all right , I 'm coming , " she said , and added in a confidential undertone to her woman friend beside her : " To tell you the truth , I 've put most of our decent liquor away , before he comes . Not that one wants to be mean ? " " Of course . He drinks like a fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Exactly . I 'll offer him one drink every night before dinner , and that 'S all . I 'm going to warn Rupert , too  --  you know what men are , no sense . I do n't want that poor girl embarrassed in my house . " After lunch the affectionate husband and his young wife left , and the rest of the guests sat about on the terrace among the ash trays and the coffee cups . Lilo and Rupert were easy , thoughtful hosts . " Who 'd like a snooze ? " she asked . " Plenty of beds upstairs . " " Oh , I do n't think so . " " Too nice out here , Lo . " " What 's happened to your boarders ? " " Well , I do n't know . I said any time they were ready , we 'd be here all day anyway . Their rooms are ready for them . " " I 'm sure Sigmund likes to sleep , " smiled the baroness . The baron shrugged , politely denying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Yes , I know , I know him ! " his wife cried delightedly . " Come on , Sigmund , " said Rupert . " Let 's go up . I 'm dead too . " " Of course " said Lilo . " What about you , Noele ? " Two of the men and three of the women went upstairs , leaving the baroness with her shining unpowdered face turned to the sun , two other men with the Sunday papers behind which they instantly began to breathe deeply and regularly in the slumping anesthesia of food and wine . I T WAS five o'clock by the tithe the Doug-lases came . They arrived just at the point when they had failed the mild expectancy of the household so long that everyone momentarily really had forgotten about them ; they produced a pause , a moment of unexpressed confusion when the room full of people was confronted with the living reminder of the couple about whom so much had been said all day . The faces turned toward Sheila Douglas  --  that curiously English contradiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  filling the doorway behind her with his large sandy-colored presence  --  and tingled with guilt . The baroness , looking out of her schoolgirl 's large eyes as if she peered over a wall , remembered Sheila , but did not think that she had seen the husband before . The baron , sleepily immersed in ? politics , which worked round his mind as slowly and seriously in South Africa as they had done in Europe , rose from his chair and stood a moment with his heels neatly together ; as he sat down again he remembered who these people were and lowered his eyelids as a cat does when settling down to regard something interesting . Lilo stood introducing everyone to Mrs. Douglas , her hand lifted like the hand of a nervous conductor . In between , she fussed aside : " Sheila , my dear , I 've put your little Elizabeth in with Eva , I hope you 'll approve . . . . One side of the cupboard is cleared for her things , if that will he enough ? " The tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never focused on anything smaller or warmer than open spaces , whose stiff , little-girl neck rose very straight from her neat blouse , smiled slowly and faintly to everyone , looked submission to Lilo , and sank , still very upright , to the edge of the sofa , next to Noele and Bertie Haffner . Noele said brightly , " I 'm sorry I take up so much room . The way Lilo feeds you ! I could see myself spreading visibly , all day . . . . " But the young woman merely looked at her quickly , like a child who does not know whether or no to answer , and continued to sit on the edge . Her two hands met each other in her lap . " Hullo , " said Andrew Douglas , from the door . It was an amused hullo ; at once a greeting , a reminder , and a challenge . He stood there , looking at them all . " Oh , I 'm awfully sorry  --  Andrew , Baron Varohevsky , Baroness Varohevsky , Noele and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this is Archie 's wife , Betty , and Frank Davis . " Andrew Douglas stood at the door , touching a hand to his forehead in salute to them . He was so big , it seemed for a moment that the frame of the door held him there . Did he need holding ? Or did they imagine that he swayed slightly , or rather that something in the way he held himself showed that somewhere inside him , something swayed . " Hi , " he said , looking down between his legs , " hi there ! " A LITTLE boy as sandy-haired as himself burst through his parted knees ; Lilo 's Eva struggled past at the same time . Another small girl , also sandy-haired , came in and went straight and silently to the side of her dark mother , sitting in silence on the edge of the sofa . Noele 's blond children , pale-eyed furies , tore in , too . Andrew grinned down at them . He was one of those handsome fair men whose features , eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dissolvent of liquor and fleshiness . Every brandy he took , like an inconsequent drip wearing away the fine edge of a stone , gently smoothed away the clarity with which once his nose had been cut against the planes of his face , washed the green and sharp hazel flecks of his eyes more nondescriptly into each other . His whole face had the effect of being a little blurred to the eye of the be-holder , like a print that has been over-enlarged . He had a large mouth with freckled lips ; the kind of mouth that must always be fresh from the imprint of a kiss , a drink , or a dangling cigarette . " Swept off my feet . Do you think I look like a swing door ? " " Oh yes , Dad , be one , be one ! " His small son charged at him and the man whirled his heavy body around with surprising agility . The children squealed under his flaying arms . He sat down suddenly in a chair , in the midst of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low heads he caught the eye of the little baroness and smiled at her lazily , acknowledging the child in her , too . A suffused brightness came up over her face ; caught out , she smiled back . LL conversation in the room had ceased at the entry of the new guests ; it seemed impossible to revive it . It was as if the big blunt presence of this man who should , surely , have sensed the weight of the others ' disapproval and discussion of him and have felt some measure of unease before them , had thrown them off their social balance by his complete ease . Somewhere , subconsciously perhaps , they had determined that they would put him at ease , for her sake , if nothing else , in order to save her embarrassment . Now it was he who seemed to be putting them at ease . He sat in his chosen chair looking round at them , moving slightly to shift himself to comfort inside the rather washed-out army issue shorts which were too tight for him round the waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been before lunch . Noele and the baroness had theirs already ; Bertie had asked for gin and tonic , the baron a vermouth . When Rupert asked Sheila Douglas what she would have , she started , and sitting nervously forward , said almost inaudibly , " Oh  --  thank you  --  a small gin and lime juice , please , if you have it ? " Her large , dark , blank eyes were fixed on her husband in a kind of taut , warning expectation . He looked up in answer to Rupert 's question , felt himself interrupted , like a tap on the shoulder , by the intensity of the girl 's look , and could not escape it , met it good-naturedly , ironically , but not with the weight of his full attention ; meanwhile he was waggling a foot to amuse the little Eva . Suddenly the English girl said stiffly : " I wish you would n't . " The remark fell with the prim clarity of a stone into a puddle . Everyone in the room was instantly remote with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He leaned his head back against his chair , looking lazily questioningly from his wife to Rupert : " Just a small brandy . And water , Rupert , please . " He lowered his head in an imaginary charge at the little Eva , who crouched back squealing delightedly . His wife sat with every line of her body drawn up , looking at him . Noele Haffner managed a light polite remark to the baroness , Bertie said something to Frank Davis , but whatever was spoken was merely an undertone to the line of high tension humming from the figure of Sheila Douglas to the heavy blond man relaxed in his chair . He made no attempt to join in the desultory conversation , but , unlike his wife who was obviously deaf to the normal , the trivial inconsequentialities about - her , he had the look of a man who had half an ear for the talk , tolerantly , even though he could not bring himself to the trouble of contributing . She sat , isolated in her reproach . He finished half his drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking straight at that pretty , tight English face , the discreetly tinted mouth with the corners of the lips pulled in , the small . narrownostriled nose , the well-washed ears just show-ing beneath the perfectly neat , conventionally cut hair . And Noele Haffner saw the skin under his eyes crinkle in an intimate , insolent , culpable smile that was closer to a wink . Nothing moved in the face of the English girl . Even the dark lashes remained lowered and steady . The man heaved himself up out of his chair with a grunt and wandered over to the window , where he put his glass down on the sill . The children were about the floor , getting under his feet . He picked up a toy guitar one of them had left lying on a stool and said , catching one of Noele 's blonds by the hair , " What can you sing ? D' you know Yankee Doodle ? " He stood there , grinning , with the toy in his freckled hands . And , strumming he began to sing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a pony . " He pulled a chair round and sat down to it . The children giggled . " Oh my darlin ' , oh my darlin ' , oh my darlin ' Clem-en-tine , " he sang softly . And then with a thump and a flourish on the tuneless strings , he burst into " Camp-town Races " with a minstrel accent and gestures in the best and most exuberant tradition . The children came and stood round him , as if he were a freak , with all the cruel candor of their curiosity . " Sing some more , " they demanded , as they might have said , " Show us your sores . " Now , he had the low , insinuating drawl of a torch singer , the pouches of his faded handsomeness drooped toward his red-grained neck " It was just one of those things . if we 'd thought a bit , of the end of it , wh-en we start-ed painting the town ... we 'd have been a-ware , that our love-affair was too hot . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling at their puzzled faces : " No ? Well , what about this ? " and he sang " Abdul the Bulbul Amir . " T HEY were enchanted : the small Eva moved her head with a gasp of distress when Ivan Petruski Skavar was slain , the breathing of the boys was heavy as in the act of identifying themselves with cowboys in a film . After four or five verses , the baroness came and stood with an arm about each of the blond Haffners . Frank Davis learned forward with his elbows on his spread knees , his emptied glass dangling like a transparent lily between his hands . Noele Haffner crossedone tightly-stockinged leg over the other and sat back , the corners of her mouth twitching . Smiling , Rupert got up to replenish Davis ' glass , and in answer to a frowning parenthetic sh-sh ! from Lilo , almost tiptoed . " Did you ever know that song of the French , perhaps ? " said the baroness when the ditty was over . " I heard it when I was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " And shyly , she lifted her hand and conducted her own thin voice for a bar or two . A NDREW Douglas sat with his full lips amusedly together , gravely , the guitar still in his hands . Then he struck an excruciatingly tuneless chord on the thing and began to sing , in a charming , slightly nasal French , the song of which she was thinking . " But you sing awfully well ! " said the girl Betty . He inclined his head to her , mockingly obsequious , good-natured . " A damned sight better than the stuff they put over the radio , " Frank Davis admitted . Bertie Haffner was looking at Douglas appraisingly . He said suddenly : " You know , I think we were once on a party together in Cairo . End of ' 44 or beginning of ' 45 . Of course . . . . But you were half the size then , man ? " " And your waistline ? " his wife Noele cut in indignantly . " Have you forgotten your ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I know . " Bertie laughed , putting his hand gently on his crumpled waistband . " Sing Alouettel Please ! " Betty pleaded . " I adore ' Alouette ' . " The big blunt hand handled the toy guitar as if it were a Stradivarius , in an elaboration of care that counterpointed his performance with burlesque . The voice went from " Alouette " into one of those childish songs with a refrain in which a noise is substituted for one of the words : " A fly flew in the window . . . he " ? Andrew Douglas rolled his veined green eyes , blew noisily through his freckled lips ? " there , and he " ? the children shrieked with laughter and made the noise for him ? " there , and he flew right out again . " The grownups made a discreetly laughing audience . Do you think that 's a song to sing to children ? " The English girl had her hands clenched in her lap now . Her face , firm and pretty and unchanged , unaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have learned , ten years ago , when she was a school prefect , to regard one of the girls who had let down the honor of the house . Her slim defenseless back , stiffened only by the starch of gentility , bastioned her against the people in the room . A flicker of interest passed to her ; but eyes were on the entertainer ; there was even , perhaps , a slight irritation at the interruption . Noele Haffner turned to the young woman with a smile of intercession and appeal , that instantly withdrew feebly , like a foot that has been put in the wrong doorway . 1 N THE interval of three sound thrums be-tween verses and refrain , Andrew Douglas grinned at his wife , a warm , impervious , shamefaced , flirtatious grin ; the grin with which he had looked at her for the first time eight years ago , across a bar in London . His underlip gleamed with the saliva of song , his eyes swam a little with the second brandy which Rupert had given him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm of his chair , in a claim of intimacy ; the man 's big hand left the guitar a moment to steady her ( that was the gesture , too , with which he always had put out his hand to stroke the hair of a passing girl behind the back of the girl with whom he might be dancing ) . Immediately his own daughter left her mother 's side and wriggled up onto his lap in possession . He played the guitar held above her small head . He passed from the mildly bawdy to the sentimental ballad now , while everyone had another drink , and the children began to have the look in their eyes that comes just before sleep . He was singing an old Gilbert and Sullivan air , " . . a wand'ring minstrel I , a thing of shreds and patches . , " when Lilo became conscious that something had altered in the composition of the room , and saw that the English girl , the young wife with the neat black curls and straight back , must have left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , ignored , past the backs of their chairs and out of the door , up to the two rooms which did not belong to her .
