txt 1In arranging to talk over with Premier Khrushchev issues ) ' which worry and burden the world , President Eisenhower is , I in German colloquialism , " seizing the hot iron . " There is no hotter iron , in the West German view , thane an attempt to do business with , the Soviet Union . He who tries ' it without the most exacting caution and safeguards is likely to go home with a burned hand 1  --  or worse . This sober appraisal of Mr. ' ' Eisenhower 's chances for a suc- , cessful venture in personal diplomacy arises from a particular view of the Soviet Union that has been impressed deeply ' in the German mind . No Western Government contemplates a grimmer picture of the Communist imperium . This view was formed by the experience of World War II , when a generation of German soldiers &appeared; in the vastness of Russia . It arose from the grim experiences of 1945 , when ruthless Soviet armies burst into Germany . It was confirmed and reinforced by a post-war Soviet policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , has been aggressive , inexorable and pitiless . Were it not for the protecting arm of another more benevolent superpower , the men who guide the West German state would recognize no hope of withstanding the Eastern colossus .. Nuclear Sanction Hopes have surged and ebbed in the decade since the provisional Bonn republic was established in this little university city , chosen specifically because it was inadequate to represent an ancient nation . They fell to the latest low point at Geneva . This is not because Chancellor Adenauer and his advisers feel West Germany is more sorely pressed than in any other late summer they can remember . It is just that another opportunity . for the Soviet authorities to " change " ? at the Geneva conference of foreign ministers ? has passed with no change . Only one basic improvement in East-West relations since the lines were drawn in the wake of World War II is admitted in Bonn . This is that the risk of open aggression . ever present in the Stalin era , has diminished under the massive sanction of ity-leveling nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is more artfully executed by Stalin 's successor . It suits Mr. Krushehev 's policy to lower the degree of international tension at the moment . But this is a superficial achievement , in the view of the men who work in the Palais Schaumburg here . The Soviet leader 's hand remains on the thermostat . He can heat up the " cold war " at will and overnight with a new Berlin crisis or another thrust into the Arab-Asian regions . Does Chancellor Adenauer see any immediate hope for abatement of the truculent rivalry the Soviet Union insists on maintaining with the capitalist West ? No . Does he hope over a longer term ? Yes , he looks to the day when the dynamism will have gone out of Soviet policy as the eager Russian people achieve more of the good things of life that Mr. Khrushchev has been promising them . But it may well be a long wait before the Soviet leaders are compelled , to consider whether the extraordinary effort of the Soviet Jnioirto further its aims abroad is worth the drain on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest achievement in his meetings with Mr. Khrushchev , the West Germans believe , would be to hake the Moscow Presidium 's present conviction that the struggle must go on . The President might accomplish this by showing Premier Khrushchev a strong and confident America , clearly able to resist the Communist challenge indefinitely . He might convince the Soviet leader that there ) would be nothing to lose in lim-1 icing the stalemated arms race ! by moving into controlled disarmament agreements by easy stages . The West Germans do not ! pretend to know whether Mr. , Khrushchev is prepared to en tertain such thoughts . But they are more skeptical than Presi-I dent Eisenhower seems to be , It is more in keeping with ) Soviet character , Bonn believes , ) that Mr. Khrushchev will try to exploit his encounters with , President Eisenhower solely for ' Moscow 's ends . Officials expect him to come forth with many a rolling declaration of peaceful intentions . They will devote their close attention  --  and will recommend to Mr. Eisenhower the same course  --  to the fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East-West Above all , the West Germans are concerned about their own country .

He does not know where such 4iscussion might lead . lie lacks ( he confidence in President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Herter to make their way surely down perilous paths that he freely accorded to John Foster Dulles. 1The Geneva Package The Chancellor , therefore , will do his best to persuade the President to limit his discussion of ' Europe and Germany to the ' framework constructed by the Western Allied powers at the ' Geneva conference of foreign ministers . This would tie any attempts at a general European settlement into a " package " in which any military solutions would be bound up with progress , as the West measures it , in the political field . Since the Soviet Union would not even dicker to buy the Western " package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little prospect of substantial achievement by the President . Dr. Adenauer is well aware of this . It is better , he believes , to accomplish nothing than to give away minimum positions simply to show " progress . " The attitude of a suspicious haggler is not a popular one in West Germany . Once again , hope is styring that the heartbreak of living in a partitioned country and the fear of sudden death raining from the skies may be swept away . Chancellor Adenauer knows ' that he will be blistered again by opposition politicians and a substantial number of his countrymen as an obstructionist or ' worse . This he will bear with the attitude of a wise and patient man who knows what is bitter for the nation . Nevertheless , Dr. Adenauer knows , too , that the Bonn republic can not dictate its terms to even the friendly one of the two predominant powers . He can emphasize how hot the iron really is . It is history 's legacy to the Chancellor that he can do no more . ADENAUER WILL INSIST ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Basic Aims By ARTHUR J. OLSEN Special to The New York Times .
