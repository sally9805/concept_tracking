The telephone rang in Vice President Richard Nixon 's Washington office . Over the wire came the voice of Dwight Eisenhower , who wanted to talk about the speech Nixon would make that afternoon at Ike 's Gettysburg farm . There 650 Republican leaders from every state would gather for the formal launching of the 1956 campaign . " Lay it on the line , Dick , " said the President . " Let 's get a little tough with those people . " <P> Nixon promptly threw away his prepared speech notes and set to work anew , aware that the telephone call had signaled a turning point in the campaign : Ike is through turning the Republican other cheek to Democratic attacks . As Nixon knew , the brunt of carrying the counterattack would fall upon him and G.O.P. National Chairman Leonard Hall , for Ike had no intention of lending the presidency to campaign potshotting . <P> Well before most of the Republican workers arrived in Gettysburg , Host Eisenhower was buzzing around the farm in his Crosley with the fringe on top , surveying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east pasture . Spotting two big white trailers south of the tent , he asked : " What are those buses ? " Whispered Appointments Secretary Bernard Shanley : " Those are comfort stations , not buses , Mr. President . " Ike whipped his glasses out of his breast pocket for a look , gasped : " Oh , for goodness ' sake . " At 4:30 p.m. he took his seat on the platform and the program began . First major speech was a warm-up by Len Hall , then the speech that Ike had been waiting for . Author : Dick Nixon . He did not believe in answering personal attacks on the President , said Nixon , but when the Administration 's accomplishments are misrepresented or distorted , " it is our responsibility to set the record straight . " Examples : <P> Foreign Policy . " We have heard over and over again . . . that there is no peace . . . that our foreign policy has failed and our prestige is at an alltime low . All I can say about that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Administration which never recognized there was a war in Korea may not know the difference between war and peace . " <P> The Draft . " For a candidate for the presidency of the U.S. to suggest one day that we are ' losing the cold war ' and the next day that we might get rid of the draft . . . is the height of political fakery and irresponsibility . " <P> Communism at Home . " It should n't be an issue which would ever divide Americans . But if Mr. Stevenson does not repudiate the statement of Mr. Truman , who still says that Alger Hiss was not a Communist and not a spy , then we have no choice but to discuss the issue and let the people decide whether we or our opponents are better qualified to handle this difficult problem .
