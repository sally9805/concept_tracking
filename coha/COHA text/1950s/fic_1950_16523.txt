Apple goes out of focus and we see an old lady washing clothes on a scrub board on the back porch of her house . 2 EXT . TALL GRASS - NEAR APPLE TREE - DAY 2 Camera sees three boys 10-12 years old crawling up through the tall grass toward apple tree . They are carrying home-made toy guns . 3 ANOTHER ANGLE - APPLE TREE - DAY 3 Camera is tight on the apple as we see a small hand slowly pluck the apple from the tree . 4 ANGLE ON BACK PORCH - DAY The old woman sees the kids stealing apples . &nbsp; OLD WOMANHey !

They are the Cleggs - Uncle Shiloh and his nephews , Jesse , Reese and Floyd . As they pass the camera it pans slightly to pick up a sign on the outskirts of town . It hangs tipsily by one broken link and the lettering is already faded and weathered . It reads : WATCH CRYSTAL CITY GROW  --  3  --  7 EXTERIOR - CRYSTAL CITY STREET - KIDS - DAY 7 These are the same kids that we saw previously . They are playing as the come up the street towards camera , shooting at each other as they hide behind wagons or whatever is available . They are enjoying their stolen apples and playing make believe gunfighters. 8 EXT .

She is terrified of the leering animal-like Reese . 11 WELLS FARGO DOORWAY - DAY 11 Shiloh looks back over his shoulder and sees Reese . He slaps his leg with his quirt . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSReese ! ! 12 ANOTHER ANGLE - BOARDWALK - DAY 12 With a freightened look on her face , the lady takes a couple of steps backward then turns and hurries back down the boardwalk the way she came . 13 INT .

Thye are Travis Houston Blue of Texas and Sandy Owens of Abiline , Kansas . Sandy is driving a horse trader 's cart - a stout buckboard with bedrolls and a water keg lashed down tight - in effect , a small chuckwagon . Travis rides alongside , handling hismount with the effortless grace of the born horseman , and keeping his eye on a well bunched string of Navajo ponies . Sandy is whistling or singing some cowboy ballad , but he breaks off in the middle of a bar as Travis rides in close . 21 MOVING SHOT ON TRAVIS AND SANDY - DAY 21 &nbsp; SANDYWay I figger , Travis ... these ponies ought to bring thirty dollars a head . Travis merely gives him an amused glance but says nothing . &nbsp; SANDYAnd twelve head at thirty dollars a head comes to three hundred and twenty ! &nbsp; TRAVISThree sixty . &nbsp; SANDYIt does ? ? ...

Why , that 's not bad for four months work ... not bad at all ....  --  6  --  He resumes his singing or whistling with newenthusiasm , but breaks off at the sound ofdistant shots and the approaching drum of hooves . The horses in the string begin acting up and Travis has his hands full controlling them . 22 EXTERIOR - OPEN COUNTRY - DAY 22 With Travis and Sandy in the foreground the Cleggs appear in the distance riding at a gallop and looking back at an unseen posse . The Cleggs course is toward the horse traders wagon , but when they see it they veer slightly . The posse comes into view behind them - clearly outdistanced and obviously in a vain pursuit . 23 ANGLE ON BUCKBOARD - DAY 23 Sandy reaches back into the wagon and half pulls out a rifle . Travis spurs his horse between Sandy and the Cleggs . &nbsp; TRAVISNever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the plunging animals in the string , forcing them back into their former compact bunch . Once again Travis 's splendid horsemanship is featured . 24 EXT. - OPEN COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - DAY 24 The Cleggs vanish over a dip in the hills . 25 EXT . OPEN COUNTRY - ON POSSE - DAY 25 As the posse reins in at an arm signal from the marshal , clearly abandoning the pursuit . Then at a lope , the posse approaches the horse traders . The marshal is an angry man and only waits until he is in hailing distance to let the boys know it . &nbsp; MARSHALWhat 's the matter with you fellers ? ? 26 ANGLE ON WAGON - DAY 26 As the marshal and one or two of his posse ride close . Travis dismounts . &nbsp; MARSHAL ( fuming ) Chase ' em right into your laps and you set here and let ' em go ! ... Coulda taken a shot at ' em anyways ... Them was the Cleggs !  --  7  --  Travis seems not to have heard the marshal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's horse with a shrewd trader 's eye . Now he comes closer to the animal , checking the hocks , knees , etc . The marshal does n't submit patiently to this scrutiny , but reins his horse from side to side . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( casually ) Was n't our fight . &nbsp; MARSHALYeah ? Well , maybe you do n't know I got a right to arrest you for aidin ' and abbetin ' ... Law says it 's the duty of every ... GIT AWAY FROM MY HORSE ! ... duty of every male citizen to ... to .... He breaks off , peering , interested in spite of himself , as Travis goes to his horses head and opens his mouth to study his teeth . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( casually ) Pretty fair .... Tell you what , marshal ... I 'll trade you that bay gelding there and five dollars for your horse . &nbsp; MARSHAL ( testily ) I did n't come out here to swap horses ! The marshal starts to ride off , moving past Sandy . &nbsp; SANDYI thought the Cleags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're operatin ' in Utah territory right now ... But they wo n't be for long . The marshal continues away , but Travis calls after him . &nbsp; TRAVISI 'll make that ten dollars ... CASH ! The marshal is tempted . He pulls to a stop , hesitates , then his sense of outrage returns .  --  8  --  &nbsp; MARSHALTen eh ? ... Well , that 's a ... ( then angrily ) No ! ... Come on , boys . He and the posse start away . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( calling ) See you again , Marshal . &nbsp; MARSHALNot likely ! As the posse rides off , Travis stands looking after it with a faint grin . 27 EXTERIOR - MAIN STREET - CRYSTAL CITY - DAY 27 It is a day or two later . Down the street come two men , Johnathan Wiggs and Adam Perkins , followed at a respectful distance by Perkins daughter , Prudence . The little party proceeds down the dusty street at a good pace , purposful and preoccupied and apparently oblivious of the small covey of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fearful - but wholly fascinated - curiosity . For these people are Mormons , of whom they have heard some awesome things . WIGGS AND Perkins stop and turn off at the place where the horse traders have made their camp . It is either a corral or an improvised enclosure ( depending on availability ) where SAndy and Travis are offering their horses for sale . 28 EXT . CORRAL - DAY 28 Sandy is sitting on the corral fence . Travis is sitting on the horse he previously offered to sell the marshal , with one leg cocked over the saddle horn . The marshal and one of his deputies walk over to Travis . &nbsp; TRAVISHowdy , Marshal . &nbsp; MARSHALHowdy.  --  9  --  The marshal walks back and forth looking at the horse that Travis is sitting on . He squats down beside the horse and takes out his pocket knife and begins to whittle . &nbsp; TRAVISThis here 's a good horse ... mighty gentle . You fellers lookin ' fer a horse trade ? If you are , I 'll sell you this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , wind and limb .... 29 EXTERIOR - MAIN STREET - CRYSTAL CITY - DAY 29 The Mormon trio is continuing their approach toward the corral . They walk very erect and as if they had a purpose in mind . Prudence follows at a respectful distance . 30 EXTERIOR - CORRAL - DAY 30 As the Mormons approach in the background , Travis is closing the horse trade with the marshal , who is already mounted on the horse he has just acquired . A small knot of towns-people are standing around watching the transaction . Travis counts silver dollars into the marshal 's palm . &nbsp; TRAVISTen , eleven , twelve ... Got yourself a good horse there , Marshal . Course he has his own little peculiarities . His own little failin 's , so to speak ... Ai n't he , Sandy . Travis walks to the corral near Sandy , leans against the corral , looks up at Sandy and winks . Sandy smiles , puts his fingers to his teeth and whistles a shrill whistle . The horse begins to buck , bucking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in a circle , with the marshal riding for his life . Finally the marshal can stay on no longer and is thrown down along the end of the boardwalk . All the townspeople have a big laugh . The marshal gets up , dusts himself off , and with a disgusted look , stomps away . 31 ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRAL - DAY 31 Favoring the onlookers as Wiggs and Perkins push through the group to approach Travis and Sandy . The hearty laughter of the onlookers dwindles and dies at the sight of the Mormons . The men move aside grudgingly making room for them . Travis and Sandy can not help but be  --  10  --  conscious of the slight chill in the air . Prudence stays with the Mormons but somewhat behind them , not intruding on men 's affairs . Wiggs turns to Travis as the top man of the partnership . Travis is whittling and Wiggs takes out his knife and begins to whittle . &nbsp; TRAVISHowdy , Elder . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSThese here your horses ? &nbsp; TRAVISYeah , they belong to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; TRAVIS ( grinning ) Ask the marshal ... he can tell you . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSWhat are you fellers figger'n on askin ' fer ' em , mister ? &nbsp; TRAVISAll of ' em ? &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSYup . &nbsp; TRAVISFifty dollars a head . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ( outraged ) Fifty ? ! ! ...

That 's enough to make the Lord himself be ..... Again the threatened profanity shocks Perkins . &nbsp; PERKINSElder ! ! &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ( grudgingly ) All right . I repent my words of wrath . With renewed anger as he turns back to Travis &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSBUT I BE GOL-DARNED IF I PAY ANY FIFTY ...

What about it , Grampaw ? &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ( flaring ) Do n't you grampaw me , you young whippersnapper . I 'll pull you off that fence and fan your britches for you . &nbsp; PERKINSNow , Elder ... &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ( gaining control ) Folks around here tell me there 's no trail through to the San Juan . &nbsp; TRAVISFolks is right . &nbsp; SANDYBut we been there ! &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSWith your wagon ? &nbsp; TRAVIS ( grinning ) Yeah , that little ole buckboard 's part burro ... goes anywhere . Wiggs and Perkins exchange glances , Perkins seeming doubtful , but Wiggs is hot on the scent . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSYou boys mind tellin ' me if you 're Drinkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . Got a brother that 's a drunkard though . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSDo ya chaw ?  --  13  --  Both men shake their heads no . &nbsp; TRAVISTried it once ..... &nbsp; PERKINS ( like a D.A. ) Use the words of wrath ? The boys look vague so Wiggs translates . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSHe means do you cuss . &nbsp; TRAVISOnly tolerable well ... &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSYou family men ? &nbsp; BOYS ( in unison ) No , sir . Wiggs looks at Perkins , who now seems satisfied - although not compleltely . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSHow 'd you like to sell us all these gentle horses of yours here for fifty a head - and maybe pick yourselves up an extra hundred or so on the side ? &nbsp; TRAVISDoin ' what ? &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSWagonmaster , that 's what ... Leadin ' our wagons to the San Juan .... to a valley the Lord 's been reservin ' for His people .... so we can plow it and seed it and make it fruitful in His sight !

That 's their deadline . Mormons ... Cleggs ... Showfolks ... horse traders ... DEAL ... an ' if you claim low again you better start runnin ' ... As Travis gathers up the cards the Mormon bullhorn sounds . Sandy and Travis exchange uncomfortable glances . Travis  --  16  --  pitches a silver dollar into an empty whiskey glass sitting in the middle of the table . &nbsp; TRAVISI 'm in. 33 . EXT .

He hands Sandy his string of horses and lopes off screen . 40 ANGLE ON HEAD OF COLUMN - DAY 40 Elder Wiggs is still leading the wagons as Travis spurs up alongside . &nbsp; TRAVISSwing ' em west , Elder ! &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSWest ? ...

Travis rides in the lead and Sandy has turned his horses loose with the other loose horses of the remuda and is helping herd them along . 42 LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON - DAY 42 The wagon train is moving steadily across open country . ( Note : It is suggested that each successive shot of the wagons on the march should be of the train covering progressively more difficult terrain . The progression will be from rolling plains to desert to broken country torn by ravines to foothills and finally mountains ) Sandy is riding well out in front , acting as point . 43 ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 43 As Sandy comes galloping back to the lead wagon , driven by Perkins . Prudence sits beside her father . &nbsp; SANDYKeep to the right of that mound . You folks doin ' all right ? &nbsp; PERKINS ( sourly ) We 're all right . Sam Jackson , who alone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurs jealously between the wagons and Sandy . &nbsp; JACKSONAnything I can do to make you more comfortable , Miss Prudence ? &nbsp; PRUDENCENo , thank you kindly , Mr. Jackson . &nbsp; JACKSON ( w/hostile glance at Sandy ) Well , if there is anything ..... Sandy senses his antagonism and jealousy and with an easy wave to the Perkins spurs out ahead again . &nbsp; PERKINS ( staring ahead ) Just you remember , they 're Gentiles !  --  20  --  Prudence flushes and looks swiftly at her father , then looks ahead again - making no answer . Sam Jackson nods his approval of this paternal warning . &nbsp; JACKSONStrikes me Elder Wiggs is risking the Lord 's wrath ... hiring Gentiles to lead us . &nbsp; PRUDENCEAnd strikes me Elder Wiggs knows more about such things than you do , Sam Jackson ! &nbsp; JACKSONNo call to get riled , MIss Prudence .... if you think it 's seemly to be laughing and talking with Gentiles .

The wagon drivers try to ease their teams down a slight incline bordering the creek ( Or as the terrain dictates ) 45 ANOTHER ANGLE 45 Sandy gallops back to assist Sister Ledyard with the grain wagon . The bouncing of the wagon has forced her hat down over one eye and she struggles to push it back while handling her team . 46 ANOTHER ANGLE - WIGGS WAGON - DAY 46 Elder Wiggs is sawing on the lines of his team . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSEasy , goldang ya ! Easy , you cussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put some sense into these foul critters ? Travis rides alongside . &nbsp; TRAVISHang on , Elder .

As the wagon moves along more easily , Travis drops back to ride alongside Wiggs. 47 MOVING SHOT - ON WIGGS AND TRAVIS - DAY 47 &nbsp; TRAVISCould be I 'm wrong , Elder ... But it sure sounded like you were usin ' the words of wrath back there ! &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSBut I repented ! Yes , sir , I tell you , son , there ai n't a man in Utah Territory quicker to lose his temper or quicker to  --  22  --  repent than I am ... Lord and I , we got an understanding about that . Travis laughs and spurs out front again . 48 ANOTHER ANGLE ON THE TRAIN - DUSK 48 As the wagons slowly move along the bank of the stream toward a camping ground . They stop at Travis ' signal . 49 STREAMS EDGE TWILIGHT 49 Horses are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the camp . Prudence raisies a brimming bucket from the stream and starts away with it , only to be intercepted by Sandy . He reaches for the bucket . &nbsp; PRUDENCEI can tote it . Sandy takes the bucket . &nbsp; SANDYSure you can , but there 's no need to . They turn and start up the slope when Sam Jackson plants himself squarely in Sandy 's path and reaches aggressively for the bucket , snatching it away , jostling Sandy in the process . &nbsp; JACKSONI 'll carry it . Sandy recovers his balance and angrily takes a step forward . Jackson is obviously waiting for him to start swinging , but Travis ' voice checks him . &nbsp; TRAVISSandy ! Travis walks into the scene , seemingly unconscious of its tension . He plants a hand firmly on Sandy 's shoulder . &nbsp; TRAVISWe need a hand on the picket lines . Sandy grudgingly turns away . Jackson shows his satisfaction and Prudence seems a little disappointed .  --  23  --  50 MOVING SHOT ON TRAVIS AND SANDY - DUSK 50 &nbsp; TRAVISWe got enough trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for trouble ... But I ai n't backin ' down from it neither ! &nbsp; TRAVISYou would n't be much use with a busted arm ... besides .....

Sandy looks backward too . 51 ANGLE ON PRUDENCE - DUSK 51 She is toting her own bucket and Sam Jackson is discon-solately staring after her . 52 ANGLE ON SANDY AND TRAVIS - DUSK 52 Sandy grins and sets to work with a will driving the picket pins . 53 MORMON CAMP NEAR STREAM - NIGHT 53 The Mormons are gathered around several small campfires , their wagons forming a backdrop behind them . Men are repairing broken harness , women are mending clothing or cradling their weary children in their arms . 54 STREAMS EDGE DAY 54 It is early the next morning and the wagons are drawn up along the edge , ready to make the crossing . Horses are drinking and men and women are filling kegs and utensils with water . Sandy gallops down the line of wagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dipping buckets into the stream .  --  24  --  &nbsp; SANDYBetter fill up some kettles too , Miss Prudence  - -  -  Fifty miles to next water . Sandy continues down the line of wagons , camera panning with him . 55 WIDER ANGLE ON STREAM CROSSING - DAY 55 As the grain wagon lurches out into the stream , to be followed in succession by the remaining wagons . Travis and Sandy are in the thick of the crossing , helping any rig that threatens to bog down ... taking hold of some of the leaders , whipping some of the horses with their quirts to keep the wagons in motion . 56 ANGLE ON PERKINS WAGON - DAY 56 As Sandy rides in , takes the bridle of the lead horse and helps it ascend the far bank . He tips his hat jauntily to Prudence . &nbsp; PRUDENCE ( smiling ) Thank you , Mr. Owens . 57 ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 57 As Sandy spurs up beside Travis to help him and two Mormon boys drive the remuda through the stream . As the last wagon passes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to young Billy Jamison , standing knee deep in the stream , hauling on a huge bucket and vainly trying to overtake his parents wagon . Near the boy is a happy mongrel dog , Teddy . In the boys pants is stuck a huge old fashioned .44 revolver . Travis rides closer . &nbsp; TRAVISCatch up , bub ! He swings down and plucks the bucket from the youngster 's hand and swings it almost in the same motion on the dropped tailgate of the Jamison wagon . Billy grabs hold of the tailgate and swings himself aboard , wet to the hips . He pulls the revolver out and carefully wipes the barrel on his sleeve . &nbsp; TRAVISDo n't shoot me now .  --  25  --  Billy aims at the sky and snaps the trigger . &nbsp; BILLYCa n't ... no bullets . Travis laughs and rides on ahead , crossing the stream , racing to regain his place at the head of the column . 58 FULL SHOT - THE WAGON TRAIN - DAY 58 The stream behind it , it moves at a steady pace toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - THE WAGON TRAIN - DESERT - DAY 59 It is later . The wagons move at a slow crawl across an arid wasteland . A brassy sun beats with unrelenting intensity upon the trudging caravan . Mormon men and women walk beside their laboring teams . Only the smallest of the children are permitted to ride . Travis , who is leading his horse , comes to a stop and looks off concernedly as the grain wagon comes into sight , its team being led by Sister Ledyard . She is dusty , disheveled , and at first glimpse seems near the point of exhaustion . 60 CLOSER ANGLE - MOVING - DAY 60 As Travis joins Sister Ledyard . &nbsp; TRAVISMaybe you ought to ride a bit , ma'am . &nbsp; SISTER LEDYARDYoung man , I 'll have you know I pushed a cart from Troy , New York , to Salt Lake thirty years ago - following Brigham Young .

The boy signals Travis to keep his secret , placing his forefinger to his lips . Travis returns the signal and plods up front beside Elder Wiggs. 62 ANGLE AT FRONT OF WAGON TRAIN - DAY 62 The elder is moving ahead doggedly with his eyes fixed on the horizon . He neither turns nor slackens his pace as Travis comes alongside . After a moment he speaks . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSHow far would you say we 've come ? &nbsp; TRAVISTen - twelve miles . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSThen we got forty more miles of desert . &nbsp; TRAVISYes , sir , and after that we come to .... &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSDo n't want to hear about it ... the Lord and I got enough on our minds just gettin ' across this desert ... we 'll worry about the next part when we come to it . Travis grins and continues on out front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SANDY AND TRAVIS - DAY 63 Sandy and Travis are riding out a couple hundred yards in front of the wagon train . They pass a canteen , taking cautious swallows . &nbsp; SANDYHow they doing ? Travis merely shrugs . &nbsp; SANDYFolks like them ai n't made for this kind of country .  --  27  --  &nbsp; TRAVISThere is n't anybody made for this kind of country ... not even the Navajos . &nbsp; SANDYIt 's ... say , do I hear music ? Travis listens intently . A fresh gust of wind brings the sound to them more clearly . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( puzzled ) If I 'm not loco , so do I. &nbsp; SANDYYou suppose it 's Navajos ? &nbsp; TRAVISNever heard of a Navajo playing a guitar . They ride off in the direction of the strange sounds . 64 ANOTHER ANGLE - DESERT RAVINE - DAY 64 As Sandy and Travis complete their ride , pull up their horses and gape at what they see . Now a recitative song is clearly heard to the accompaniment of a ragged beat of a bass drum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the boys swing off their horses and lead them slowly forward . 65 ANOTHER ANGLE - RAVINE - DAY 65 The sight presented amply accounts for the boys bewilderment . There is , preeminently , a gaudy medicine wagon stranded in the ravine . Across its sides are the words : DR . A. LOCKSLEY HALL KICKAPOO SNAKE OIL &amp; LIGHTENING ELIXIR ( and in smaller letters ) Teeth Pulled Hair Restored Gathered around the wagon are four people : Hall , the medicine man ; Mr. Peachtree , his roustabout and drum beater ; Florey , his long-time fiancee ' ; and the gal called Denver . Hall reclines on a platform formed  --  28  --  by the dropped tailgate of the wagon . He holds a bottle of his elixir in one hand , using it as a baton as he conducts his musicians . Mr. Peachtree also sits on the platform , presiding over a bass drum - a fixed smile on his face , his eyes glazed . Florey occupies a droopy seated wicker armchair . She sholds a torn but dainty parasol over her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground near the platform . She holds a guitar which she plunks in a rough accompaniment . She sits with one leg negligently crossed high above the knee . The foursome at first pays no attention to the approaching boys . Without water for three days and forced to drink their supply of patent medicine ( 86 proof ) , they have reached that stage of intoxication where nothing would strike them as being out of the ordinary . &nbsp; DENVERWe 've got an audience .... The professor torns and peers off in a direction several yards to the boy 's right . &nbsp; FLOREY ( pointing ) Out front , Gus .... Hall swivels and tries to focus his eyes on the indicated point . He smiles vacantly , welcoming Travis and Sandy as they approach . 66 ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 66 As the boys reach the foot of the improvised stage . Denver has eyes only for Travis . &nbsp; SANDYHowdy . &nbsp; WIGGS VOICE ( off screen ) Well , I 'll be go to .... 67 REVERSE ANGLE - DAY 67 Wiggs has come to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hootchy-kootchy show ! 68 ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 68 Featuring Denver as she rises , letting the guitar fall to the ground unnoticed . She takes a cigarette from the front  --  29  --  of her dress and walks unsteadily but purposefully toward Travis , looking to neither right nor left . When she is a yard away , she pauses , swaying on her feet . &nbsp; DENVERGot a match ? She puts the cigarette between her lips and waits expectantly , her eyes never leaving Travis . He takes a wooden match , strikes it and the girl puffs . She chokes and flings the cigarette away . &nbsp; DENVER ( unsteadily ) You might ... offer ... a lady ... a drink . Travis looks at Sandy and the bottle of elixir . Travis hesitates and then offers it to the girl . Denver , with a loose , uncontrolled motion of her arm , knocks the bottle aside . &nbsp; DENVERNot that stuff ... that 's all we 've had for three days ... water ... just a drink of water ... With that her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travis 's feet . Travis drops to one knee beside her and cradles her head . Sandy looks from the girl to the bottle in his hand . &nbsp; SANDYGolly ! No wonder ! Three days with nothin ' to drink but ... ( he winces ) Dr. Hall 's Lightening Elixir ! At this point Hall , who has only caught the last words spoken by Sandy , takes a theatrical stance and begins his spiel . &nbsp; HALLYes , Friends ! Guaranteed to cure every ailment known to man or beast ... from female complaints to horse colic ... He suddenly gasps and reels back against the side of the wagon . He is in danger of falling , but Wiggs jumps to his side and supports him . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSEasy , brother .....  --  30  --  In tones of sharp command . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSSANDY ... You goldarned fool ... Go get the lady some water ... fast .... 69 DESERT RAVINE - DAY 69 A knot of Mormons is standing some distance from the medicine wagon as Wiggs makes his report . Sandy and Travis stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may assume ) Wiggs has obtained most of his information . Peachtree nods or shakes his head , rather proud of it all , as Wiggs explains . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ... so with their water gone , Mister Peachtree here poured two quarts of Lightening Elixir into a bucket and gave it to the mule ..... Peachtree practically takes a bow . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSLast they seen of her , she was goin ' over the hill like a Kansas twister ... and here they been ever since ... Now , these people have what I used to call , in my sinnin ' days , a hootchy-kootchy show . The question is , what are we goin ' to do ? &nbsp; PERKINSGive ' em a team , I guess , ' n enough water to get ' em to Crystal City . Peachtree seems alarmed and taps the Elder 's arm . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSWell , now , from what Mr. Peachtree says - the professor was n't exactly popular in Crystal City ... that 's where they came from . &nbsp; PERKINSYou mean they were run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So they started out for California . &nbsp; SISTER LEDYARDPoor man ! Bein ' driven out like that with his wife and daughter ! Peachtree shakes his head negatively . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSAi n't quite that way , Sister Ledyard . Miss Denver ... that 's the young one ... ai n't his daughter , and Miss Fleurette ... fine figure of a woman too ... she ai n't exactly ..... That cuts it ! We give ' em what they need and get along . Travis straightens and takes a step forward . &nbsp; TRAVISI do n't believe these people are up to travelin ' alone , Mister Perkins . &nbsp; PERKINSThey will be ... when they 're sober . &nbsp; TRAVISWe 'll pick up the California trail in two of three days . &nbsp; PERKINSDo n't think we ought to take up with their kind of people , Elder . Travis grows a trifle angry . &nbsp; TRAVISI 'm not leavin ' ' em ... an ' that 's flat . &nbsp; JACKSONYou hired out to us ....  --  32  --  Wiggs , to prevent trouble , interrupts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ai n't so sure the Lord did n't put them in our path for a reason . The Mormons listen attentively . Wiggs continues in a quietly persuasive voice . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSAs I see it , He ai n't one to waste His energy ... an ' He sure went to a lot of troble gettin ' these people into this fix . Now his manner becomes stern , almost Jehovah-like . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSAnd if I was HIM , I would n't want anybody messin ' up MY plans . His words have their effect . The Mormons shift uncomfortably . Sandy and Travis exchange glances - amused at the Elder 's ability to get his own way . &nbsp; PERKINSWell ... when you put it that way ! &nbsp; BROTHER BOLTONEzra , hitch up a team here . One of the stripling boys runs to do his bidding and Wiggs again faces the assembly . &nbsp; PERKINSWho 'll volunteer to drive a ways for ' em ? No one advances , fearful of their neighbor 's opinion , unwilling to risk contamination &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSBrother Schultz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33  --  Schultz shakes his head , but from behind the men . Prudence pushes forward and steps into the vacant area between her father , Wiggs and the Mormons . They look at her in shocked silence . &nbsp; PRUDENCEI 'll drive the wagon , Father . Perkins gives her a stare that would melt an iceberg . She slowly steps back into the crowd , realizing that she has overstepped the bounds of propriety . &nbsp; PERKINSAll right , folks . Tom here 'll drive ' em for a ways . Back to your wagons . We 've wasted enough time . 70 ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 70 Sandy comes forward to Prudence . Travis stands near . &nbsp; SANDYThat was right Christian of you , ma'am . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSLet 's get movin ' , boys . Travis looks at Wiggs with a twinkle in his eye . &nbsp; TRAVISYou and the Lord think a lot alike , do n't you , Elder ? &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ( hiding a smile ) Not always , son ... Sometimes He takes a little persuadin ' . 71 LONG SHOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly into the setting sun , with the medicine wagon now a strange part of the caravan . As the wagons continue , the sky seems to darken - suggesting the coming of night . 72 CLOSE SHOT - SISTER LEDYARD - DESERT - DAY 72 As she sounds reveille on the Mormon bullhorn . The earsplitting blast is enough to wake the dead . As Sister  --  34  --  Ledyard takes the bullhorn from her lips , someone starts beating on a tin wash tub , and in the background we see Mormon families tumbling sleepily from their wagons . 73 ANGLE ON PICKET LINES - DAWN 73 Under the watchful supervision of Sandy and Travis , water is being poured from kegs into a row of buckets which the Mormons are setting forth in front of the horses . The water is carefully doled out with not a drop being spilled . The men look on thirstily as the horses lower their muzzles into the water . Wiggs walks up alongside Travis . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSStock all watered ? &nbsp; TRAVISAll watered . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSHow far you reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WIGGSUh-huh . &nbsp; TRAVISOh , forty miles . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSWell , the Lord will provide . &nbsp; TRAVISI hope so . 74 ANOTHER ANGLE - MORN 74 Favoring Jackson who is saddling a horse tied to the picket line .

In the process he gets his pants tore from the waist to the cuff . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSSandy ... Jackson ... Dadblast you ... stop that .... He finally gets them both by the hair , holding them at arms length . Sandy continues to fight , swinging at thin air .

Her disordered hair and streaked face attest to it . But she is n't complaining . She leans against the wagon wheel and , indifferent to a show of leg , slips off one high-heeled slipper and dumps a cupful of sand from it . Travis notes this with some concern , crosses to her and takes the slipper . &nbsp; TRAVISYou 've been walking in these ? Have n't you got anything more ... more ... ? &nbsp; DENVERNo .

Men and women come to a stumbling stop at Travis 's cry . They look up with disbelief , then with wild hope . Through dry and dust-caked lips they mouth the one word " water " , croaking it out . &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 . Horses plunge with rolling eyes and flaring nostrils , as they catch the water scent and drivers run close and try to pull the frantic beasts to a halt . &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 .

Reverse angle from across the stream as the wagons breast the rise and plunge down the gentle slope towards the water 's edge . The horses do not stop until the wagons are hub deep in the stream .

The marshal 's words probably need not be heard , but this is what he is saying : &nbsp; MARSHAL 'S VOICEWe could n't even reach the place where they 'd gone over ... then there was another time . Some government surveyors started through ... they  --  79  --  quit after two months ... near dead . 169 ANGLE INSIDE WIGGS WAGON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesse in his search for the bacon . &nbsp; TRAVISBacon 's in the second barrel , ai n't it , Elder ? ... &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSThat 's right , son .

But Wiggs , after a brief pause , resumes levelly . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSThe Lord 's ridin ' along with us . He speaks to his team and the wagon moves on . The camera holds on the marshal and his posse . The marshal pushes his hat back from his forehead and scratches his head bewilderedly , staring after the wagon . &nbsp; MARSHALI swear , I 'll never understand them folks . As the next wagon passes , the marshal turns and looks down the line . He stares at what he sees . 172 ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 172 Shooting from behind the medicine wagon and toward the marshal and posse . The marshal rides in . &nbsp; MARSHAL ( surprised ) What are you people doing here ? 173 CLOSER ANGLE - MEDICINE WAGON BOX AND MARSHAL - DAY 173 With the posse trailing .

The marshal slows as he notes a saddled buckskin horse tied to the tail of the Perkins wagon . It is Reese 's mount . The marshal studies it with interest , then resumes his course toward the front . 176 ANOTHER ANGLE - HEAD OF TRAIN - DAY 176 Sandy and Travis , and Wiggs on his wagon . As the marshal rides in : &nbsp; MARSHALWhose buckskin horse is that tied to the next wagon ... ? As Travis looks back ... &nbsp; MARSHALSeems like I 've seen him somewheres before ... &nbsp; TRAVISSure have ! ... Tried to sell him to you once ... you can still have him pretty cheap ! The marshal is suddenly reminded of Travis 's other horse deal . &nbsp; MARSHALMister , you 've taken your last dime off me . Turning to Wiggs . &nbsp; MARSHALElder , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ( haltingly ) Well , marshal , I tell you ...

I do n't think that I could ... rightfully tell you .... 179 ANGLE ON TRAVIS AND SANDY - DAY 179 &nbsp; TRAVISI guess now 's about as good a time as any , Sandy . Sandy places his fingers to his lips and whistles the whistle that we previously heard that causes the marshal 's horse to buck . 180 WIDER ANGLE - DAY 180 The marshal 's horse begins to buck with a viciousness that we have never seen before . He bucks all around the wagon and it 's obvious that he is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In spite of a commendable job , the marshal is eventually thrown to the ground . He gets up brushing himself off and turns to Wiggs. 181 CLOSER ON WIGGS AND MARSHAL - DAY 181 &nbsp; MARSHAL ( angrily ) If I was you , Elder , I 'd be more careful who I took up with ! There 's some mighty unsavory characters travelin ' with this wagontrain ! &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSAi n't that the Lord 's truth , Marshal ! 182 WIDER ANGLE - POSSE AND WIGGS WAGON - DAY 182 The marshal turns and mounts his horse that has been brought  --  83  --  to him by one of the posse members . They ride away . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSGet up ! Wagons west ! 183 WIDE ANGLE SHOT - MINUTES LATER - DAY 183 Showing the posse as it climbs a ridge in the broad afternoon sunlight , veering off from the moving wagon train just as it enters the long shadow cast by the mountain . The posse pulls up and looks back at the wagon train until the last wagon in the caravan disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , symbolical of the loneliness and isolation to which the wagon train is committed . 184 FULL SHOT - WAGON TRAIN - DAY 184 As it winds its way up a narrow ravine whose sheer walls tower high above . Again the effect to be sought is one of man 's puniness in the face of a monstrous and threatening nature . 185 MEDIUM CLOSE - WAGON BOX - WIGGS AND SHILOH - DAY 185 Shiloh scans the towering walls and overhanging rocks with fear filled eyes and almost superstitious awe . Wiggs , on the other hand , guides his wagon with serene confidence in the Lord . Shiloh suddenly looks ahead fearfully as the sound of sliding , falling stones comes over scene . 186 FULL SHOT - COLUMN - DUSK 186 As the column emerges from the head of the ravine and pulls up onto a small plateau at the base of the mountian . Sandy and Travis sit their horses and wait for Wiggs wagon to come up . &nbsp; TRAVISThis is about as good a stopping place as we 're going to find before dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from the wagon , followed by Shiloh . Sandy and Travis dismount . The other Mormon wagons come up in the background .

Travis shakes his head and grins faintly , seeing Shiloh 's alarm . &nbsp; TRAVISMight be safer facin ' that posse , Mister Clegg . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSYou keep talkin ' that way , son , an ' you wo n't be any safer than the Elder here ! Shiloh gives Wiggs a shove toward the assembling Mormons in the background . Wiggs stumbles as Shiloh follows him . Travis and Sandy look after them , then turn to face each other . If they had any doubt about Shiloh 's intention to kill the elder , it has been settled now . Section Details 187 FULL SHOT - MORMON ENCAMPMENT - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchful eyes of the Cleggs . Their attitude is in marked contrast to their former demeanor . There is no singing , no conversation . A fretful child is quickly quieted by its mother . One of the Mormon men stands - Floyd Clegg gets quickly to his feet , watchful . The man merely goes to his wagon , gets a drink from the water barrel . Floyd watches warily . The man returns to his former place and only then does Floyd relax and sit down . A few Mormons mend harness or do other minor tasks , but they work listlessly , dejectedly. 188 ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT 188 Sandy , Travis and the professor are playing a desultory game of poker - playing obviously to kill time , not with any interest in it . Not far away sits Reese Clegg . &nbsp; SANDY ( whispers ) Maybe I could sneak off ... get the posse .  --  85  --  &nbsp; TRAVISNot much chance ... anyway , you 'd be missed ... they 'd kill the Elder right off ! &nbsp; SANDY ( Loudly ) Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stands as though to start over , then hesitates . &nbsp; HALL ( loudly ) I 'll bet three . &nbsp; TRAVISStayin ' . ( quietly ) That depends on us . Reese re-settles himself and barely turns his head as young Billy Jamison climbs down out of his parents wagon and , followed by his dog , walks with an air of almost too elaborate casualness toward the card players . Travis absently reaches a hand to pat the dog . 189 CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT 189 The boy kneels beside Travis and , with a swift look , to make sure he is not observed , opens his coat to show Travis the old pistol stuck into the waistband of his trousers . &nbsp; BILLY ( whispering ) They did n't find it ! Travis moves as though to take it , but the boy 's next words stop him . &nbsp; BILLYIt is n't loaded ... Pa would n't let me have any bullets . 190 ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT 190 On the card players , with Reese in the background . The men exchange glances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Travis quickly closes Billy 's coat over the gun .  --  86  --  &nbsp; TRAVISAll right , Billy ... you get on back to your wagon . Billy quickly gets to his feet and with a guilty air starts away . Reese looks after him , frowning . &nbsp; REESEWhoa there , you ! The youngster freezes - clearly tempted to run , but he realizes it would be in vain . Slowly he turns as Reese stalks over to him . The group at the card game stares in dismay . &nbsp; REESEWatcha call yer dawg ? &nbsp; BILLY ( stammering ) T ... T ... Teddy . Reese reaches down and pats the dog 's head roughly . &nbsp; REESENice Dawg . Boy and men relax . 191 ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT 191 Favoring Hall as he plucks threewalnut shells from a pocket and starts intoning the usual spiel as he starts practicing a shell game . &nbsp; HALLThe hand is quicker than the eye ... Now you see it , now you do n't ... Find the pea ... That 's all there is to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - somewhat to the mystification of Sandy and Travis . &nbsp; HALLA game of skill ... so simple a child can play ... Where is the pea ?  --  87  --  Reese has hunkered down beside the professor and stares fascinated . When the shells come to rest , he places a finger on one of them . &nbsp; REESEHere ! &nbsp; HALLI am sorry , sir .... He turns the indicated shell over . &nbsp; HALLYes , I know a pea is a small thing ... something larger perhaps , say , one of these . And Hall neatly plucks a cartridge from Reese 's gun belt and places it on the playing surface . He covers it with a walnut shell and begins to shuffle it . Sandy and Travis suddenly have realized what the professor 's game is - and exchange quick glances . &nbsp; HALLNow you see it ... Now you do n't .... Reese 's finger pounces on one of the shells . &nbsp; REESEThere she is ! &nbsp; HALLToo bad , my friend ! Shall we try again ? 192 WIDER ANGLE - NIGHT 192 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , but then remembers . &nbsp; REESE ( outstretched hand ) Gim me back my bullet !  --  88  --  Hall grasps Reese 's hand and uses it to pull himself erect and then , very politely , he replaces the bullet in Reese 's gun belt . &nbsp; HALLOf course ! How forgetful of me ! Reese merely grunts an acknowledgment and walks away . Sandy and Travis get dejectedly to their feet . &nbsp; SANDYWell , it almost worked . &nbsp; HALL ( calmly ) Quite right ! 193 CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT 193 And he shows them his other hand . It contains a bullet filched from the back of Reese 's belt . &nbsp; HALLTomorrow 's another day .... And he turns to head for the medicine wagon - and a night 's sleep . 194 WIDE ANGLE - DAY 194 The wagon train is zig-zagging up the side of a mountain , the wagons canted at a dangerous angle as they negotiate the steep ascent . Perhaps one or two men on horseback have their ropes made fast to a wagon , bracing their weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 195 ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 195 Accentuating the dizzy height which the wagon train has attained . Wagon after wagon reaches a small plateau . Horses and men tremble with exhaustion as they come to a halt . 196 FULL SHOT - DAY 196 The grain wagon , last in the column , is still toiling up the slope . Sam Jackson , his head bandaged , is on the driver 's box . Sandy and three of the young mormon wranglers have made their ropes fast to the sides of the wagon and to the horns of their saddles . Their horses strain upward , assisting the almost spent team . The men are shouting encouragingly to one another and Jackson is urging his  --  89  --  team onward . With a final lunge , the wagon crests the plateau and pulls up beside Elder Wiggs wagon . Wiggs is on the seat with Shiloh . They are both looking up and off . 197 FULL SHOT - FROM WIGGS ANGLE - DAY 197 Down a precipitous slope rides Travis , who has been ahead scouting out the terrain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the intervening space to the Wiggs Wagon where Floyd sits his horse . &nbsp; FLOYDWould n't ride wagon if I was you , Uncle Shiloh ...

Hall sidles up to Travis and carefully shields his palm . 199 CLOSE ON HALL - DAY 199 Revealing that he now has a bullet in the palm of his hand . &nbsp; HALLMr . Floyd Clegg has made a small contribution . 200 WIDE ANGLE - PLATEAU - DAY 200 Four of the wagons stand ready - Wiggs , Jamison 's , Perkins , and the medicine wagon .

Outriders with their ropes made fast to the tops of the wagons , ride above them , on the upslope , trying to preserve the wagon 's balance . Men and horses strain to make the almost impossible climb , drivers exerting every ounce of strength and skill to get the most out of their teams . 201 SERIES OF SUGGESTED SHOTS - DAY 201 &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 . Close on a wagon wheel - as it bites into the loose shale and barely turns . &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 . Three or four men , throwing their weight against the back of one wagon , pushing it forward . &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 .

Angle - from above the wagon , accentuating the grade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peer up . &nbsp; &nbsp; 5 . Angle on Wiggs wagon - Wiggs is working his horses with an expression of confidence , almost eagerness . Shiloh on the other hand , is hanging desperately to a support , his terror manifest . &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 . Sandy , afoot , walks on the uphill side of Wiggs off-lead horse , leading the column and guiding Wiggs 's team . Far up ahead of him may be seen a level stretch of shelf that is their immediate objective . &nbsp; &nbsp; 7 . Shot from far below - where the abandoned wagons stand , toward the tiny wagons inching their way up the mountain . Trailing the wagons , on foot , are the women and children . &nbsp; &nbsp; 8 . The women and children toil uphill , while Jesse Clegg - his shotgun across his saddle - follows them on horseback . A woman stumbles and falls . Jesse reins in but merely waits - not offering her any assistance - until she gets to her feet again and resumes her climb . &nbsp; &nbsp; 9 .

Shiloh 's legs almost buckle . &nbsp; FLOYDWhat kept you ? Shiloh cackles nervously , one fist wiping his mouth . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSHeh ! ... Heard what that marshal said ? .... Said she could n't be clumb ... But Shiloh Clegg clumb her ! Section Details 202 FULL SHOT - PLATEAU - - DAY 202 As the grain wagon pulls up the slope , passing Wiggs , Shiloh , and Reese . Sam Jackson is on the Driver 's seat and Sandy and Travis are helping the horses hold their footing . 203 CLOSER ANGLE ON SHILOH AND WIGGS - DAY 203 As the grain wagon passes with the bulging grain sacks visible through the tailgate . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSYou 'd think there was pure gold in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... He pauses and looks at Shiloh . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ... But your kind would n't understand that . Shiloh looks sharply at Wiggs and then back at the grain wagon with new interest in his eye . He has found the weapon that will defeat Wiggs and the Mormons - the grain . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGS ( thoughtfully ) Mebbe not .... 204 WIDE ANGLE ON MOUNTAIN CAMP - NIGHT 204 A cold wind beats at the figures huddled around sheltered  --  92  --  campfires . The day 's climb has turned them into a boneweary group . Not even the Cleggs are immune . Uncle Shiloh , enshrouded in a blanket , sits slumped , his head nodding . Reese is fully asleep . Only Jesse and Floyd maintain a vigil , but Floyd has to pull himself awake by sheer force of will . Wiggs , Sandy , and Travis sit at a nearby fire . Jesse gets stiffly to his feet and starts for the medicine wagon . Denver , Peachtree , Florey , and the professor lean against it , bundled against the cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GROUP - NIGHT 205 As Jesse walks up to them , Florey looks at him with open dislike . &nbsp; FLOREYWhat do you want ? &nbsp; JESSESome of that pain killer .

Jesse enjoys a passing leg show . 206 MEDIUM CLOSE ON SANDY , TRAVIS AND WIGGS - NIGHT 206 As they stare frowningly off at the medicine wagon . Travis does n't look too happy . Sandy looks at his friend sympathetically , but says nothing . 207 ANGLE ON MEDICINE WAGON - NIGHT 207 As Denver descends with a bottle of Lightening Elixir . Jesse reaches to take it but Denver , her eyes holding Jesse 's , takes the first drink before passing him the bottle . As he tilts it up to his lips , Denver darts a look at the professor . Florey frowns at her but Hall is clever enough to understand her game . She takes the bottle from Jesse 's hand and holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half full .

He puts a tentative arm around her . She yields slightly . He kisses her , then releases her - with a triumphant laugh he turns toward Travis . Denver puts her arm through his as though to accompany him back to the Cleggs fire . Jesse pulls away and merely takes the bottle . &nbsp; JESSEI had you pegged from the beginning . He turns on his heel and starts away . 208 ANGLE ON TRAVIS , SANDY AND WIGGS - NIGHT 208 Travis watches Jesse as he rejoins Floyd at the fire . Sandy and Wiggs eye him apprehensively. 209 MEDIUM CLOSE ON MEDICINE WAGON - NIGHT 209 Denver stands looking after Jesse . Florey is studying her bewilderedly - unable to understand her behaviour . Denver hunches her shoulders , pulls her clothing tighter as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enigmatic . Slowly she starts for the Travis group . 210 ANGLE ON TRAVIS , WIGGS AND SANDY - NIGHT 210 Travis sees Denver approach , but after one quick glance deliberately stares into the fire , ignoring her . Wiggs and Sandy give her a hostile look . She comes to a stop in front of Travis , waiting for him to look up at her . When he refuses , she smiles a little bitterly . &nbsp; DENVER ( quietly ) I thought you might need these . One by one , she tosses two bullets onto the ground before him and then , without waiting for an answer , hurries away . 211 CLOSE ON TRAVIS - NIGHT 211 As his hand quickly covers the two bullets and as he looks up after her with full realization of what she has done .  --  94  --  212 FULL SHOT - NEXT DAY 212 On the last two wagons of the train , with Jesse Clegg , mounted with shotgun over his saddle , riding behind them .

Jesse rides through them . 214 ANOTHER ANGLE AT HEAD OF TRAIN - DAY 214 As the Mormons make way for Jesse , the open ground ahead is revealed . The trail has suddenly come to an end . Ahead lies merely a narrow ledge on the side of the mountain , a ledge barely wide enough to accommodate a single horseman . On one side of the ledge , the mountain rises almost sheer ; on the other is a drop into a yawning chasm .

Sandy and Travis exchange somewhat sheepish glances and then , as Wiggs prayer continues , remove their hats .  --  96  --  &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ( off screen ) Lord , I 've heard it said that faith can move mountains ... Bein ' a weak an ' sinful man , I reckon I just do n't have that kind of faith . But the brethren here .... 218 STUDY OF MORMON FACES - DAY 218 &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ( O.S. ) had faith enough to cross mountains when folks said they could n't ! .... 219 TIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not one to question Your reasons , Lord , but I ca n't believe You 'd let us come this far if you did n't mean for us to go all the way .... He turns back to the Mormons . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSBrethren , pray along with me. 220 ANGLE ON MEDICINE GROUP - DAY 220 Standing apart from the main Mormon party , the self-conscious medicine show people are impressed by Wiggs simple prayer . Florey drops to her knees and Peachtree , very sheepishly , follows suit . Hall hesitates , then gets to one knee . Only Denver remains standing , but her eyes are suspiciously bright and her gaze , like the Elder 's , is heavenward. 221 ANOTHER ANGLE - WIGGS - DAY 221 With Travis , Sandy and Shiloh in the background . Travis is staring reflectively at the ledge . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSAmen ! Only the Cleggs remain unimpressed . Shiloh deliberately turns and stares at the ledge . He spits a jet of tobacco juice and turns back to Wiggs.  --  97  --  &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGS ( laughing ) ... it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad your wagons do n't run on a single track ! He smacks Reese on the back , enjoying his own wit . But Travis suddenly spins excitedly from the contemplation of the ledge , stares at Shiloh with a glinting eye . &nbsp; TRAVISThat 's a good idea , Mister Clegg ! They all gape at him . Travis turns to Wiggs . &nbsp; TRAVISYou carryin ' picks and shovels ? Wiggs nods . &nbsp; TRAVISGet ' em . He turns to Shiloh with a slow grin . &nbsp; TRAVISIf this dugway works , Mister Shiloh , you can consider yourself an angel of the Lord ! Shiloh looks around uncomfortably as his nephews regard him with a touch of superstitious awe and Reese shifts a few inches from him . 222 FULL SHOT - LEDGE - DAY 222 Travis , backed by Jackson , Schultz , and other Mormons carrying picks and shovels , stands on the ledge . He indicates an imaginary line with his hand across the middle of the ledge . &nbsp; TRAVISStart here ... I want a trench just wide enough for a wheel ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the picks start swinging . Travis passes the Cleggs , who look on curiously , still unconvinced . pp. 52-77 &nbsp; pp. 98-110 223 FULL SHOT - HEAD OF COLUMN - DAY 223 As Travis rejoins Wiggs . &nbsp; TRAVISWe 'll have to lighten the wagons ... Maybe you can send back for whatever we have to leave . Wiggs smiles faintly . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSWhat makes you think I 'll be around to send back for anything ? Then , covering up quickly . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSI 'll see what can be spared . As he moves off , Travis stares after him , knowing that Wiggs is fully aware of his impending death at the hands of the Cleggs . As he stands , the professor joins him and covertly hands him the bullet he has filched from the Cleggs . Travis holds it in his palm , his expression thoughtful . &nbsp; TRAVISThat makes four ... four bullets ... four Cleggs . He looks off toward Denver , off-screen. 224 ANGLE ON PERKINS WAGON FROM TRAVIS 'S POV - DAY 224 Including the professor and Travis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dusty pair of stout shoes she had surrendered to Travis once before . Prudence , in her turn , is admiring the fragile slipper Denver has just removed . Denver suddenly catches Travis 's eye on her , blushes and ducks her head to fasten her shoe . 225 MOVING ON WIGGS - DAY 225 As he threads his way down the line of wagons . Mormons are stripping their wagons of all but the most essential items . As he passes Mrs. Ledyard , she is surrounded by a welter of discarded household articles . Among them is a dressmaker 's dummy at least eight sizes smaller than she  --  99  --  is . Mr. Peachtree , obviously in love with the dummy 's figure , stares at it wistfully . It is apparent that Mrs. Ledyard has been telling Peachtree of her former beauty . &nbsp; MRS . LEDYARD ... and I had the smallest waist ! Why , my first husband could put his two hands all the way .... Suiting the action to her words , Mrs. Ledyard thoughtlessly starts to girdle her ample waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a yard . Mr. Peachtree shakes his head sadly . At the next wagon , Brother Bolton stands wistfully gazing at an accordion , obviously considering its abandonment . Wiggs pauses . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSWe 'll need music , Brother Bolton ... Bolton smiles his gratitude and Wiggs continues . At the Jamison wagon , a carefully quilted mirror leans against a wheel while Jamison hauls an infant 's cradle across the tailgate . He hesitates , looking at his pregnant wife . &nbsp; JAMISONI could make another , Mary . &nbsp; MRS . JAMISON ( smiling ) Doubt you 'll have time .... She takes the quilt from the mirror and sets it down tenderly . &nbsp; MRS . JAMISONGuess I can do without that mirror , though . Wiggs pats her shoulder in passing and continues on . 226 ANOTHER ANGLE ON JAMISON WAGON - DAY 226 Young Billy Jamison stands wide-eyed as Travis slips the loaded gun into the waistband of his pants , out of sight under his coat . Travis turns and starts hurriedly away at the sound of Sandy calling his name . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FULL SHOT - THE DUGWAY - DAY 227 The Mormons have completed their job . They stand aside , leaning on shovels and picks . A groove has been cut lengthwise across the ledge . As Travis approaches , Jackson faces him . &nbsp; JACKSONThat the way you wanted it ? Travis nods . &nbsp; JACKSONI 'll take the first wagon over . &nbsp; TRAVISI was figgerin ' on doin ' that myself . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ( hurrying up ) I 'll lead out .... They all turn and give way at the sound of a new authoritative voice  --  the professor 's . &nbsp; HALL ( off-screen ) Stand aside , gentlemen ! 228 FULL SHOT PAST TRAVIS AND GROUP - ON MED . WAGON - DAY 228 As it approaches with Hall on the wagon seat , the medicine wagon moves steadily toward the ledge . Denver and Florey , both apprehensive , walk alongside . Wiggs moves out to try to stop it . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSNow , hold on , professor ! Florey runs up beside Wiggs , as if sharing his entreaty . &nbsp; HALL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon contains nothing of value ... its driver included .  --  101  --  Florey runs up beside him . &nbsp; FLOREYI 'm going with you ! 229 FULL SHOT - LEDGE - DAY 229 Travis takes the halter ropes from the lead team and starts guiding them out onto the ledge as Florey climbs up beside Hall . The other Mormons move around to help steady the wagon and guide its wheels into the dugway. 230 MEDIUM CLOSE - WAGON SEAT - DAY 230 As Florey settles in beside Hall . The wagon starts to move . &nbsp; FLOREYYou big ham ! She clings to his arm , and her expression changes to one of fear and tension as the wagon lurches , the first wheel going into the dugway. 231 ANOTHER ANGLE - CLOSE ON THE DUGWAY - DAY 231 As the first wheel locks into the groove . Mormons are steadying the wagon , holding it . The second wheel drops in. 232 FULL SHOT - WAGON - MOVING - DAY 232 The wheels in the groove , the wagon is canted preilously on one side . 233 MEDIUM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look over the ledge , then closes her eyes and clings fearfully to Hall 's arm . Beneath them is empty space . The wagon balances precariously , like a tight rope walker . 234 ANGLE ON MORMON GROUP - DAY 234 Their faces tense as they watch the progress of the wagon . 235 ANGLE FROM WITHIN WAGON - DAY 235 Shooting past Hall and Florey toward Travis as he carefully guides the horses along the ledge , steadying them , calling encouragingly .  --  102  --  236 ANOTHER ANGLE ON LEDGE CROSSING - DAY 236 Shooting from behind Travis , past the horses , toward the rocking wagon . It sways and seems about to break out of the dugway , but Travis moves the horses faster , pulls them onto the far side , and the wagon swings safely back to four wheels as the Mormons on the far side let out a yell of triumph . 237 MEDIUM CLOSE - WAGON SEAT - DAY 237 Florey and Hall can at first scarcely believe thay have made the crossing successfully . She throws her arms around him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheers of the Mormons . &nbsp; HALLThere , There , my dear ... It 's all over .... Travis comes up and stands at the edge of the wagon . &nbsp; TRAVISThey 're giving you quite a hand , Doc . &nbsp; HALLWell , they need n't expect an encore ! Travis laughs and starts away , to recross the ledge , but has to step aside as Floyd rides past him , scouting the way ahead . Travis looks after him with concern , but has to return to go about the task of getting the other wagons across . 238 ANGLE ON PERKINS WAGON - DAY 238 As it waits to cross the dugway . Wiggs stands beside Perkins . Prudence sits beside her father . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSStill of the same mind about our Gentiles , Adam ? &nbsp; PERKINSNo , Elder , I was wrong . But the Lord 's opened my eyes . He turns to Prudence .  --  103  --  &nbsp; PERKINSIt 's a lesson to us both , daughter . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ( smiling ) Do n't read her any lessons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRAVIS ( off-screen ) Next Wagon ! &nbsp; PERKINSThat 's us ! As the Perkins wagon moves out , the grain wagon , driven by Sam Jackson , takes its place . It 's the last wagon to go . 239 ANGLE ON THE CLEGGS - NEAR LEDGE - DAY 239 Shiloh waits with Reese and Jesse as Floyd rides in and dismounts . &nbsp; FLOYDIt 's a clear trail from here on down ... You can see the San Juan River from just ahead . Shiloh looks at his boys with satisfaction and his lips curl in a wolfish smile . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSThen it might as well be now ! He walks away from the ledge toward the grain wagon , with his boys following him . 240 WIDE ANGLE - DAY 240 As the four Cleggs walk toward the waiting grain wagon . All the Mormons are on the far side of the ledge , having safely crossed their wagons . Possible the Perkins wagon can be seen entering the dugway . Wiggs stands near the grain wagon on which Sam Jackson is sitting . Sandy and Travis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  104  --  &nbsp; TRAVISAll ready , Mister Jackson ! &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSNot yet ! Section Details 241 CLOSER ON GRAIN WAGON - DAY 241 Wiggs and the boys turn as the Cleggs purposefully come nearer . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSWe 're sayin ' goodbye , Elder ... we 're partin ' company . Wiggs and the others stare , knowing there is more behind Shiloh 's words . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSYou been real good to us Cleggses . ... Reese now ... he ai n't goin ' to forget you ... None of us is apt to ... So it 's only fittin ' we give you somethin ' to remember us by .... He looks at the grain wagon . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSMore valuable than gold itself ? You said so . Elder ! .... YOU ! He points at Sam Jackson . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSGit down off'n there ! &nbsp; JACKSONWhy ? What are you gon na do ? The sentence is barely out of Jackson 's mouth when Shiloh draws and fires . Jackson stares in wonder , his hand going to his chest and coming away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then lurches out of the seat and topples to the ground . Sandy and Travis can not move . Jesse 's shotgun covers them both at murderous range .  --  105  --  &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGS ( covering Wiggs ) You , Elder ... git up there .... Wiggs slowly climbs up . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSAnd to save you askin ' why , I 'll tell you ... You 're goin ' to have the privilege of takin the grain over yourself .... Wiggs gingerly picks up the lines and looks ahead . 242 REVERSE ANGLE FROM WIGGS POV - DAY 242 Over the backs of the horses toward the narrow ledge . Shiloh stands near the wagon seat on the opposite side from Travis . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSOnly it 's gon na be at a dead run ! ... and the wheels ai n't gon na be set in that groove ! 243 CLOSE ON WIGGS - DAY 243 Wiggs lips tighten as he hears his death sentence , and worse , the destruction of the grain and the failure of his mission . 244 MEDIUM CLOSE - SHILOH AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand back ! Give the elder some room .... He turns and hands his quirt to Reese . &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGSReese , I 'll let you whip up them horses .... As Reese takes the quirt and steps forward with a hellish grin .... &nbsp; TRAVIS ( quietly ) Drop it , Reese !  --  106  --  245 REVERSE ANGLE - DAY 245 Favoring Travis as he stands in front of the lead horse . He has thrown open his coat and pulled the pistol from the waistband of his trousers . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( still quietly ) You heard me ! 246 WIDER ANGLE - DAY 246 Floyd is the first of the Cleggs to recover and go into action . Stepping in front of Jesse to face Travis , his hand flases to his gun , but Travis beats him to the draw and fires . Floyd drops . Jesse raises his shotgun only to be tackled by Sandy who flings himself upon him and the two men stagger back to the side of the mountain , locked in a struggle for the shotgun . Shiloh fires at Travis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot at Reese - who was trying to draw a bead on him with his rifle . Reese is spun backward and goes down in a heap . Shiloh takes cover behind one of the wagon wheels on the side opposite Travis , but unable to get a shot at him through the legs of the horses . He turns his attention to Jesse and Sandy , still struggling for the shotgun . Jesse , with his superior weight and strength , is giving Sandy a beating . Sandy 's back is to Shiloh . Jesse has the shotgun crosswise across his neck , thrusting it up and back , in spite of Sandy 's efforts to hang on . Jesse brings up his knee into Sandy 's groin and then with an upward jerk of the shotgun , sends him sprawling on the ground ... just as Shiloh fires at what had been the clear target of Sandy 's back . Jesse gets the shot in the stomach and , with a bewildered expression , pitches forward on his face . Shiloh stands and gapes and almost numbly takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boys . Sandy sprawls on the ground , twisted with pain , exhausted and unable to reach the shotgun on the ground near him . Travis comes from behind the horses , covering Shiloh with his pistol . &nbsp; TRAVISDrop your gun , Mister Clegg ! 247 CLOSER SHOT - DAY 247 Shiloh seems not to hear him , so lost is he in the tragedy that has befallen the Cleggs.  --  107  --  &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGS ( sobbing ) My boys ... You killed my boys ... Good boys they was .... &nbsp; TRAVISYou better drop it , Uncle Shiloh ... &nbsp; UNCLE CLEGGS ( whining ) Sure ... sure ... I 'm whipped ... I know when I 'm whipped .... He starts to turn , his hands slowly coming up as if in a gesture of surrender . He presents the picture of a defeated , harmless old man . But as he completes his turn , his gun hand leaps up - but not quick enough . Travis fires - the shot fails to stop Shiloh as he tries to fire back . Travis fires again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands digging into the dust . Travis slowly turns and looks up at Wiggs. 248 ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 248 Revealing Wiggs , still perched on the wagon seat . He is looking at the dead men , at Sandy slowly and groggily getting to his feet , at Travis with the gun at his side . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSI thought you never drew on a man .... &nbsp; TRAVISThat 's right ... Only on snakes ! 249 REVERSE ANGLE - DAY 249 As Travis turns and starts away , followed by Sandy , the Mormons come running across the ledge . Prudence and Denver are among the first , each with fear and anxiety in their eyes . Prudence does n't hesitate when she sees Sandy , but runs to him . Denver slows when she sees Travis , and with a shyness new and strange to her , can not take another step . She must wait for him to come to her . 250 CLOSER ANGLE - TRAVIS AND DENVER - DAY 250 As Travis joins her , he holds out one of his hands for one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 251 It is either the same day or the next , and the Mormons stand grouped under vaulting , cathedral-like arches of stone . Five rock cairns mark the graves of the four Cleggs and of Sam Jackson . Wiggs stands bareheaded before them , his face raised in prayer or sermon . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSHe was a good man , Brother Jackson was ... maybe a mite quick to anger , but that 's a manly failing ... And now , as to these Cleggs .... He pauses , sorting his words . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSI ca n't give ' em much of a recommend and that 's the truth , Lord ... But it 's not for us to judge them . This I will say ... Sometimes we need the evil to bring out the good ... For a man never knows his strength until it 's put to the test .... Amen . As he turns from the cairns . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSLead out , BROTHER Travis . And the Mormons make for their wagons as Travis rides through an arch , pauses , and makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of the wagons clatter through the arches behind him .... 252 WIDE SWEEPING PANORAMA OF A BEAUTIFUL GREEN VALLEY - DAY 252 ( It is hoped that the cinematographer may find a valley with a winding brook , lush grass , the very picture of a worthy goal for this Mormon migration . ) From behind the camera , in this scene , roll the Mormon wagons , men , women and children walking beside their teams . 253 ANOTHER ANGLE - THE GRAIN WAGON - DAY 253 Mrs. Ledyard drives , while Elder Wiggs rides alongside . He comes to a stop at a point commanding a view of his valley and as the grain wagon continues past he looks happily from the bulging sacks to the fields below , seeing in his mind 's eye the four-square Mormon blocks , the  --  109  --  lines of Mormon poplars , the communal fields , and the sturdy houses that will be built . He is so lost in his reverie that he does not at first heed the appearance of the professor and Florey who come up beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; FLOREYWhat are you doing , Elder ... laying out the streets and the town hall ? Wiggs starts at her voice , then smiles . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSYep , and the schoolhouse too ! He is struck by a sudden thought . &nbsp; ELDER WIGGSDoc , why do n't you and Miss Florey stay with us ? You 've earned a piece of this valley ! ... Why , you could farm a piece of land , or teach school , or ... ( with utter sincerety ) You 'd be most welcome . Florey looks at Hall with swift hope that possibly now , at long last , she may realize her dream of a home . Hall is deeply touched , but realizes the life is not for him . &nbsp; HALLNo , Elder ... it 's kind of you to want us , but we 'd only be in the way . He takes Florey 's hand . &nbsp; FLOREYBut there is one thing you can do for us ! She looks meaningfully at the professor . &nbsp; HALL ( sheepishly ) Ah , yes ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah ... engaged long enough . &nbsp; FLOREY ( nodding ) Twelve years .  --  110  --  &nbsp; HALLI 've never believed in long engagements , so I think the time has come ..... &nbsp; ELDER WIGGS ( explosively ) Well , I 'll be go to .... ! &nbsp; HALL ( shocked ) Why , Elder ! 254 ANOTHER ANGLE ON BILLY JAMISON AND DOG - DAY 254 As they cut excited capers running back and forth through the tall grass . As they approach camera we rise slightly and pan with them as they run up to Travis and Denver walking arm in arm . Travis leads his horse . We see the wide panoramic beauty of this lush valley as our group continues on until they are small specks in a sea of grass . CREDITS ROLL pp. 78-97 &nbsp;
