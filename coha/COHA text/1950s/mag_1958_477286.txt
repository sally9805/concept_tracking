U. S. Senator , Pennsylvania A potential Presidential candidate tells how he won his surprising victories in Pennsylvania ? and how the mayor of a big city operates , in a job that is sometimes subtle , sometimes rough , and always fascinating . LATE one afternoon in the fail of 1943 , 1 was sunning myself on the terrace of an Air Force billet at 26 Ferozshalt Road , New Delhi , India , looking through a copy of Life Magazine . There was a picture of Bill Blillitt in a Chesterfield and Homburg inspecting slum property in Philadelphia . Bill was running for mayor on the Democratic ticket against Barney Samuel , the incumbent Republican . 1 thought to myself ; " That 's what I 'm going to do when the war is.over and I get out of this uniform . " World War II was really just beginning then so far as we in the China-Burma-India Theater ? known in the Pentagon as those ' ' Confused Bums in India " ? were concerned . Two years went by before I turned in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discovered at my mother 's family home at Avery Island , Louisiana . When I came back to Philadelphia I could afford the luxury of seriously going into politics . I had only dabbled in it during the ' thirties , for I had been pretty well occupied with making a living out of the law . The Democratic party in Philadelphia was looking for new blood in 1946 . Despite the long record of Republican misrule , the Democrats had not elected a mayor since 1884 and the Republican political machine was solidly entrenched . The depression had created a Democratic party where none had existed before ; but although it came close to winning the mayor 's office in 1935 and 1939 , Bill Builitt took a bad beating in 1943 . When 1947 rolled around , Democratic chances were dim indeed . Luckily , I found myself in excellent company when I first got involved in local politics . Dick Dilworth and Jim Finnegan had also come hack from the war interested in working with the Democratic party . By the spring of 1947 the three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city committee chairman ? had moved into positions of local party influence . Dilworth and I helped organize an effective independent group largely through Americans for Democratic Action . Finnegan was Bradley 's right-hand man at the city committee . Without Jim we would never have succeeded . His untimely death this 24 NOTES ON POLITICAL LEADERSHIP spring deprived our party of one of its ablest and most respected leaders on the national as well as the local scene . He made the art of practical politics an honorable profession . Dilworth made a valiant but unsuccessful campaign for the mayor 's office in 1947 . Next year a series of Republican scandals hit the headlines . In 1949 , with Finnegan as city chairman ( Bradley having become Collector of the Port ) , Dilworth was elected city treasurer and I city controller . Two years later L was mayor , Dilworth was district attorney , and Finnegan was president of City Council . A new city charter was approved and the Democrats controlled the Council fourteen to three . The ball had certainly been thrown to me . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first took office as city controller in 1950 I came into contact with Frank Short , who had been budget clerk under the Republican regime . Frank was an old newspaper man turned municipal financier by accident . In those primitive days he ? together with Ed Harris , Republican leader of the 46th Ward , and Bill Shellenberger , formerly an employee of the Pennsylvania Economy League ? had the job of throwing together an annual city budget which would meet the requirements of the Republican city committee as expressed through City Council and the mayor . Frank and I became warm friends . His advice was disinterested and intelligent . During my two years as controller I rarely made a move affecting the budget without first talking over the details with him . When I became mayor , Frank moved over to the city representative 's office , where his newspaper training and wide knowledge of city hall made him invaluable as a consultant on public relations in the widest sense of that much abused term . One day in 1951 we were talking together about the scandals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have happened if Judge Lamberton had lived . " " Why not ? " I . asked . " Because he was a completely honest man , " Frank replied , " and his own high standards of integrity spread from the mayor 's office all over the city . " Lamberton , an incorruptible judge , had been drafted to run as mayor by the Republican machine in 1939 to save it from that fate worse than death ? the election of a Democrat . The maneuver was successful , but after slightly more than a year in office Mayor Lamberton died ; city hall slumped back to its normal pattern of unimaginative inefficiency and small-time graft . The chance conversation with Frank Short led me to some thinking about the function of leadership in an urban democracy . Surely if Lamberton 's integrity had the result attributed to it , there must be other ways in which the impact of a mayor 's character and political philosophy could make itself felt ? not only in local government but throughout the community generally . An old and favorite story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Navy in the first Cabinet of President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Swanson , beloved by all who knew him , was once asked to what principles he attributed his political success . " To three rules of conduct from which I have never deviated , " he replied . " First : Be bold as a lion on a rising tide . Second : When the water reaches the upper deck , follow the rats . Third , and most important of all : When in doubt do right . " Perhaps the second maxim is as essential for political survival as the first and third are for political success . It was my good fortune as mayor never to have the water reach the upper deck , although there were a couple of times when it came pretty close to the gunwale . But often it seemed wise to be bold and , at least on occasion , doubt was resolved on the side of virtue . The mayor of a large city has heavy executive responsibilities ? especially in a city such as Philadelphia , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relatively little authority to the City Council . Within his limited field , such a mayor carries responsibilities which differ only in degree ? not in kind ? from those of the President . Philadelphia , with a population of more than two million . has more inhabitants than twenty of our forty-eight states . The mayor 's problems , therefore , are more difficult than those of many a governor . It has been said that the second most demanding executive job in America is held by the mayor of New York ; the mayors of our other great cities can feel , with good reason , that they follow close hehind ? and that the qualities of political leadership demanded of a President , a governor , and a big city mayor are not very different . WHAT DOES A MAYOR REALLY DO ? I T IS hard for a mayor to plan his day , for he has no fixed routine ? or at least I was never able to arrive at one . Speaking dates , to be sure , are lined up in advance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within ten days of passage ; and Council passes a batch / every week . Cabinet meetings took two hours at lunch on Wednesdays . A large group of commissioners , deputies , and often their wives , met with me in the evening four times a year . The budget message has to go down to Council on a day in September . Most of that month and all of October each year found a high priority given to political campaigning , in support of candidates for everything from clerk of the Quarter Sessions Court to President of the United States . And every February and March there were endless meetings in the traditional smoke-filled rooms to work out a " slate " of candidates which would prevent that anathema of all professional politicians : an open primary fight . But , in between , I was never certain of what was coming next . Arriving at the office at 8:30 A.m. , I would unload my briefcase , turn over to my staff for processing the papers acted on at home the evening before , and send hack to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office around six , the mail would be signed and the briefcase repacked . In between , each day was different and therefore fascinating . Much of my time was spent listening to other people 's plans and problems . On a typical day , for example , the city 's managing director and fire commissioner were having a rough time with the head of the- firemen 's union ( they kept on having it for four long years ) . The director of finance was concerned lest our campaign to have new loans authorized at the spring primary would fall on its face ( it did ) . The city representative wanted help in determining whether to serve sherry , bourbon , both , or neither , to Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands at 11:00 A.M. at the reception at the art museum ( we settled for sherry in the Dutch Room ) . The city solicitor was concerned because the Board of City Trusts refused to admit Negro orphans to Girard College ( as this is written , the question is still unsettled ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 83rd and Buist Avenue ( we finally closed the dump ) . The Greater Philadelphia Movement wanted the city to put millions of dollars into a new Food Distribution Center in South Philadelphia but Albert M. Greenfield said it was a waste of the taxpayers ' money ( the city is now financing the project ) . Throughout this crowded routine , a man new to the mayor 's office is compelled to hammer out for himself the principles that should guide him in exercising power over the life of a city . One of the first things that struck me was how true ? and how terribly difficult to apply in clay-to-day reality ? were the copybook maxims which have been the old standbys of political commentators and teachers since Thucydides . WHERE THE BUCK STOPS I T SHOULD go without saying , for instance , that a mayor must be honest ? not only money-honest but intellectually honest . Honest not only with other people but , even more important , honest with himself . " To thine own self be true " is as good advice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially difficult , for wishful thinking can so easily convert " I want it " into " This is right . " But simple honesty is not enough ? not nearly enough . It is here that Lincoln Steffens ? who spent years studying corruption in American cities ? vastly underestimated the complexity of American municipal government . Steffens 26 NOTES ON POLITICAL LEADERSHIP Chin Up , Boys ! T HE following headlines appeared top right and top left on page One of the Wall Street Journal , March 18 , 1958 : Federal Seers Predict Deeper Recession , Now Doubt Mid- ' 58 Upturn Many Firms Use Yachts , Retreats to Aid Execs ' Morale , Spur Business thought that if the business interests would keep their dirty hands out of politics , honest citizens would elect honest officials who would then collect the garbage and reform the police department and everything would be fine . Maybe that was a sound analysis of the problem in the old days , but things are far different now . Every mayor soon learns that there are both honest and earnest conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must strike a balance among them . An equally obvious requirement is that the mayor should be a good administrator . Harry S. Truman ; as President , had the cardinal rule of sound administration posted on his White House desk : The buck stops here . " No matter how complex the issue and however meritorious opposing plans may seem , the mayor , like the President , must make the decisions ? and he must make them promptly and firmly . He may get some help from the briefing of competent advisers , from prayerful ? and preferably secluded ? thought and analysis , and from a few well-chosen personal contacts on the grass-roots level . But in the end the chief executive must act on his own responsibility and his alone . This is a rule much easier stated than followed , and so are the other ancient precepts of sound administration . Every political leader will agree with them wholeheartedly ? while regretfully remembering the many times during his own career when he violated them . Here are a few of the classics : . Pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that orders have been carried out , support your administrators unless they are clearly wrong ; then either fire them or take the rap yourself . ( If I had it to do overagain , I would not appoint a hall-dozen men whom I chose at that time . ) Remember that with each individual you have a cup of good will . You can gulp it down or sip it slowly . And if you sip ? it tends miraculously to renew itself . ( I drank too quickly the cup of good will of at least three Philadelphians , whose resulting opposition delayed or defeated many a pet project . ) . .. Order your life so you can work hard and still get adequate rest , some time for your family and friends , and a chance not only to keep up with your profession but with the major currents of creative thought in the world about you . ( At least twice a year I had to make bonfires of the papers which had languished unread in my briefcase for months . ) THE ART OF MOVING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administrative labyrinth of the mayor a lty I found , curiously enough , that my four years in the Air Force were my salvation . Lawyers , as a rule , get no experience in administration . I did not even know what the word meant when I got myself a . captain 's commission in August 1941 . Imagine my surprise on finding myself a year later " Director of Organizational Planning " for the Air Staff . I knew nothing about organization and less about planning , and I had to learn fast . A few months later I took a nine-week cram course in personnel administration at the Command and General Staff School in Leavenworth . Kansas . Next thing I knew I was in New Delhi drawing organization charts in five colors to show the relationship between the British Army , Navy , and Air Force ; the Chinese Army and Air Force ; the Indian Army and Air Force ; the American Army Engineers , Air Transport Command , Tenth Air Force , Air Service Command , IleadqUarters AAF India-Burma Theater ; Joe Stilwell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis Mountbatten ( known as " The Supremo , " no kidding ! ) , Air Marshal Sir John Baldwin and his RAF colleagues , and ? finally ? my own boss , Major General George E. Stratemeyer , in whose debt I shall always be for his warm friendship and support . You ca n't be a part of an organization which grows a hundredfold ? from two thousand officers and twenty thousand men ? in four years , without learning something about administration in the BY SENATOR JOSEPH S. CLARK 2 ? process . Without the Air Force I would have been lost in the mayor 's chair . Beyond the timeless and universal rules of public ethics and administration , the political leader must also try to master a more sophisticated set of tactics . The art of handling his friends , his enemies , and himself in a constantly changing local political situation can he very subtle indeed ? and in learning it there seems to be no substitute for experience . Suppose , for example , that you have just won a great political victory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are a local hero . You will accordingly have a honeymoon ( unhappily without a bride ) during which you can accomplish easily a good many things which will be difficult , if not impossible , later on . It is important , therefore , to strike while the iron is hot ? if I may mix a metaphor . Our reform administration came into office in January 1952 , on a wave of good will and civic virtue which drowned effective opposition for well over a year . During that period we were able to push a $20 million tax increase through a reluctant City Council . We were also able to establish both the foundations of a sound personnel system based on merit instead of patronage ? and to hire the best available people for executive jobs , despite the fact that some of them came from as far afield as Denver and Oakland , California . Moreover , the marriage was still a happy one when we beat back the first attack of the combined Republican and Democratic organizations to cripple the new city charter in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be subjected to flattery ? much of it , to be sure , obvious and nauseating , but a good deal of it subtle , insidious , and disarming . Remember , therefore , with Lord Acton that all power tends to corrupt and take frequent measurements of the size of your head . There are , I found , three good antidotes for a swelled head : ( 1 ) Subordinates who are n't afraid of telling you the truth . While there were many in this category , I was blessed with two particularly able and candid administrators in Lennox Moak , director of finance during the first two years , and his successor , Vernon Northrop . The former , with the finesse of a battering ram , the latter with the skill of a trained diplomat , kept the mayor in his proper place . ( 2 ) Continued association with very old friends who knew you before you became Mr. Big Frog in a relatively small puddle . I lunched quiteoften with four ? my college roommate , Morris Duane ; my lifelong friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law partner , Carroll Wetzel . A frank , relaxed talk with men like these was bound to send one back to city hall with a better understanding of one 's assets and liabilities . ( 3 ) A wife who tempers affection with understanding of human frailty . For this there is no substitute . I have one such . You must constantly and carefully assess the powers of your office in relation to other power groups . You must know where you stand with City Council , with the local judiciary , with the governor and state legislature , with the administration in Washington and the Congress and the multiple federal agencies to which you will inevitably look for help . The Philadelphia charter gives the mayor great advantages in dealing with City Council . His appointments do not need to be confirmed ; he has comparative freedom to administer as he sees fit ; not much substantial municipal legislation is called for . Only with respect to the budget can the mayor be checked . Luckily , as I 've noted , we got over the tax increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Jim Finnegan was president of the council all went well . By the time he left , early in 1955 , a pattern of co-operation had developed which even the constant and bitter rows I had with the Democratic organization did not destroy . In other governmental agencies ? local , state . and federal ? we cultivated assiduously those people who could help us most , whether they were Democrats or Republicans . FRIENDS AND ENEMIES A N O T H E R preoccupation that every prudent mayor should have constantly on his mind is his relations with the local press , radio , and TV stations . Here I found that hard work pays off handsomely . When our reform administration took office . many reporters , commentators , and editors had a healthy skepticism about both our motives and our abilities . Some of them suspected that the mayor 's hat was high and his ' shirt stuffed . We did our best to play everything on the top of the table ? to be friendly , available , co-operative , and frank . Gradually the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell , though not much ? began to dissolve . One incident that may have had something to do with this was the mayor 's press party one hot August evening ; our 28 NOTES ON POLITICAL LEADERSHIP , rendition of " Sweet Adeline " at about midnight was so outstanding that neighbors called the police . Whatever a politician 's platform may be , the reporters ' racist important judgments about him are personal ones ; if he is trying to cover something pretentious or phony under high-sounding phrases , they soon find it out . A political leader also needs to know at every minute just where he stands with his own party and the opposition . So far as the Republicans were concerned , we were lucky indeed . They were so demoralized by their defeat in 1951 , so lacking in leadership , so inept in opposition . that for four years we were able to ignore them . With the Democrats it was difFerent . The philosophy of our administration was completely opposed to that of many of the leaders of the city organization . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? nothing else . Yet we could not win elections without them . So , for four years there was brush warfare for limited objectives ? never massive retaliation on either side ? probably because neither antagonist was able to select a time and place of his own choosing . Each spring we would quarrel bitterly over candidates in the primary . Each fall we would kiss , make up , and have pictures taken with our arms around each other 's shoulders . I always kept thinking : " This spring we must knock them out of the box . " But the time never came . And in 1955 when question of the succession arose the organization swallowed Dick Dilworth as its candidate for mayor like a brave little boy taking castor oil . Yet as I look back on my administration I think that one of my most serious early miscalculations was thinking that I could ignore the Democratic city committee and get away with it . So far as defending the city charter and getting our budget through Council were concerned , we were successful , But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman , and his ward leaders held on to their power in the county offices . And in the state legislature in Harrisburg no legislation affecting the city of Philadelphia went through without Green 's consent . This situation resulted in many frustrating failures and I had to eat a lot of humble pie . Even today , the governor must look to the city committee rather than to the mayor if he wants help in carrying out his state program . A successful politician must learn what he . can expect from his local business and financial leaders and from organized labor . We came to expect nothing from the Philadelphis Chamber of Commerce . Like its national parent , it kept repeating ancient and obsolete dogma . For sixty-seven years it had got its way in city hall ? low taxes , inadequate municipal services , favors for those who would pay for them ? and it was slow to realize that times had changed . Yet I now feel that if I had been more tolerant and friendly toward the Chamber , we might have avoided at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new leadership in the Chamber is giving Mayor Dilworth co-operation I never could obtain . WHO SPEAKS FOR THE PEOPLE ? F 0 RT UNATELY , the Chamber did not speak for all the city 's businessmen . The top-flight business leadership was organized in the Greater Philadelphia Movement , and it was eager to co-operate . These men supported the Penn Center development ? a vast project ( reported by James Reichley in the February 1957 issue of Harper 's ) which is remaking the center of the city . They developed the new Food Distribution Center , replacing the city 's old and inefficient markets . And they organized and helped finance the citizens ' charter committee , which was of tremendous heip in getting and keeping our basic political reforms . Most of them were Republicans , but they were " Greater Philadelphians " before they were partisans ? and therefore as anxious to get our help as we were to get theirs . Organized labor had supported us on our way up , although there were a few rough moments at the summit . For over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AFL leader in Philadelphia , because of my own tactlessness . He wanted a representative of labor on the civil service commission , which I did not think appropriate . Of necessity , he had to espouse the cause of Jim Forbes , flamboyant leader of the firefighters ' local union . He was also concerned because we had abolished the forty-hour week for city employees two clays after we took office ? not because we opposed it , but because the lame-duck Republican Council which had voted it in had /ailed to provide the tax money to pay for it . From where Joe sat , he had a strong case , and I should have been more sympathetic to the difficulties which confronted him inside his own organization . But , on the whole , the unions stood solidly behind our administration and asked for little they were n't entitled to . Many of their leaders served faithfully and well on the non-paid citizen boards and commissions which were an important feature of the new charter . Winning and holding the loyalty of the civil servants was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting low morale we inherited . We fired a few crooked cops and firemen , made friends with the AFL blue-collar employees union , and gave everybody a long overdue pay raise . We finally convinced them , I think , that they did n't have to grease their ward leader 's palm to hold their jobs or win promotion . I believe we ended up with as fine a group of hard-working , loyal , courteous employees as any large corporation could boast of . Finally , a political leader must know how he stands with the people , and what steps he should take to keep them constantly informed of his program , so that he can rally popular support at critical moments . This was a major preoccupation for rne . We tried to operate in a goldfish bowl . We solicited criticism and suggestions . Once a week we were on radio explaining our plans and programs . Twice a month we had television shows ? " Tell it to the Mayor " on which we solicited gripes on everything from trash collection to traffic control ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed the last month 's happenings in city hall . Press conferences were held once a week . In addition , all reporters could scc the mayor on short notice at any time , and had my phone number to call at any hour . Cabinet officers spoke whenever they were . asked . Through these channels and from our political friends flowed a daily stream of information which we tried to dissect at cabinet meetings . In spite of a good many mistakes , I think we came fairly close to knowing the day-to-day public reaction to what we were doing and to what extent we could rally support for our next move . HOW HIGH TO AIM ? N O MATTER how carefully a mayor may remember all these things , he is not I kely to succeed unless he also remembers his single most priceless asset . This is simply the fact that he is the directly elected representative of all the people in his city . They look to him for leadership , not to the members of the council or to the party hierarchy , They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They cheer him if their interestsare successfully defended , and blame him for any failure . No appointed official ? city manager , managing director , or chief administrator ? can possibly get or keep the prestige of an elected mayor . Top leadership in American politics is never hired ; it is always elected . This is the mayor 's great strength . It is also his heaviest ' responsibility . For the essence of leadership is to lead , not to follow . It means staying ahead of the crowd ? far enough ahead-so that people can clearly see which way you are heading ? but not so far that you lose sight of your followers and they of you . Deciding how far ahead you should be at any moment is a matter of intuition , not something you can settle according to the formal rules of administration . It is said ad nauseam that politics is the art of the possible ? but in his heart every successful political executive knows that what is possible depends largely on the quality of his own leadership . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of men who react to new challenges in obsolete ways . Toynbee has warned us that the men who have successfully responded to one challenge are rarely able to supply the leadership needed for the next one . They tend to think the same policies and methods will work again . More often than not , they wo n't . So the primary function of sophisticated leadership is to use the experience of the past as a kind of arch , through which to look at each challenge as something quite new . A SHORT DISTANCE S OLVING these new problems requires the aid of skilled planners . They are practically all in short supply ? whether they are technicians in shelter , traffic , water resources , or race relations . They cost money . One of the leader 's jobs is to get that money at almost any cost . No mayor of any major American city can possibly succeed today unless he has at his elbow the very best planners ? for the city , metropolitan area , and region ? that money can buy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade them to enter public service at considerable personal loss . He can do this only if he holds a high conception of the purpose of political leadership He must set worthy goals for himself , for the men who work with him , and for the people he hopes to lead . Nobody can be expected to follow a mayor with clay feet . Alexis de Tocquevillc , in his classic study of 30 NOTES ON POLITICAL LE the United States , concluded that such a high standard of leadership was impossible in a democracy . Our form of government was not suited , he believed , to " give a certain elevation to the human mind . . . to inspire men with a scorn of mere temporal advantages , to form and nourish strong convictions , and to keep alive the spirit of honorable devotedness . " On the contrary , he thought that democracy was more likely to " divert the moral and intellectual activity of man to the production of comfort . to insure the greatest enjoyment and to avoid the most misery to each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E a more cheerful view . I believe it is the function of modern democratic leadership to do both ? to provide a floor below which misery will not be permitted to sink , and also to provide an environment in which the mind and spirit can flourish and rise to new heights of achievement . To do this , a leader needs that sense of history which was always a part of the thinking ADERSH IP of such men as Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill . A mayor does not come to office to preside over the dissolution of his city , any more than Churchill became prime minister to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire . He must be proud of his city 's past and anxious to play his part in its future . And in his daily life he must make it clear that he has not ? in Tocquevilfe 's phrase ? " acquired the supreme power only to administer to ... coarse or paltry pleasures . " In short , when ridding Philadelphia of corruption it was also necessary to rid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good political leader must have the ability to look ahead for the best way to the ideal future of his city . Then , when he has discerned it as clearly as he can , he must try to lead his community a short distance in the right direction ? remembering that it is his high duty to bring out the best in that imperfect and imperfectible being who is created nonetheless in God 's image : Man , on whose support his claim to leadership depends .
