At 25 , Charles Rosen is a Ph.D . in French literature ( Princeton ) who also plays the piano . Last week , after listening to a Rosen concert in Manhattan 's Town Hall , the critics told him , in effect , to quit the literature business and concentrate on the recital business . " He may become a figure of real consequence on our musical landscape , " said the Herald Tribune . " The type of mind that is going to grow with the years , " seconded the Times . <P> Rosen played a program that an older man might fear to tackle . Where the usual recital contains only one or two really testing works , Rosen 's had four . Moreover , he played them thoroughly his own way . <P> His performance of Brahms 's virtuoso Variations on a Theme by Paganini swept along like a fresh breeze in a musty corridor , slamming doors on heavy-handed traditions and uncovering the fine old structure . Listeners heard more details than they believed possible , played in tones of pastel shading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Op. 25 and surprised even hardened modern music lovers : its improbable burblings came through almost as easily as a Viennese waltz . After that came Beethoven 's Sonata , Op. 110 and , for a dazzling change of pace , Ravel 's Gaspard de la Nuit . When it was over , the audience demanded four encores . <P> Manhattan-born Charles Rosen has been playing the piano since he was five , but when he went to Princeton he majored in French literature and studied music on the side . After that came graduate work , and the big academic push that the Ph.D . requires . Then about two years ago , just before he got his degree , some of his admirers raised $1,000 to pay for a Manhattan piano debut . <P> He had all the amateur 's troubles : for the debut he rented a piano he particularly liked , but he broke a string at rehearsal and had to use an instrument with a brassier tone ; then he found that the tuner had cleaned the keyboard and left it so slippery he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skidding . Things went better last week ( he warned the management not to clean the keys ) , but his powerful performance knocked all the A strings out of tune early in the program . <P> Most of these troubles , he thinks , are the result of professional inexperience . " If you want to play the piano well , " he now says , " you have to make your living at it . " He is not quite ready for that yet . After his 1951 debut , he won a Fulbright scholarship and went off to Paris to study 15th century musical manuscripts ; he still has a few months ' work to finish in Paris ' Bibliothque Nationale . Meanwhile , he will make some recordings ( for London ) and continue to practice four hours a day . After that , he will start in earnest on his piano career .
