Forget the Geraniums A Story by Max Steele Drawings by Arthur Marokvia W E WERT ' . sitting as usual that summer on the terrace of the Caf ? Mona , around the corner from the Odeon and straight down from the Comedie Francaise , Now it was late August and the streets were deserted . Thousands of Parisians had gone south on their annual holidays and the only creature about was the street-cleaner with his broom of bound twigs . Benito Rapello  --  an American artist studying on the GT Bill  --  and I were alone on the terrace that morning . The fact is he had sent me a pneumatique asking me to meet him here . The note was rather puzzling because I did not really know him that well : I had seen him several times in an evening sketching class and later had gone with Daphne , a mutual friend , to the opening of his third exhibit , which was even more successful ( the French liked it , that is ) than the first two ; and I had talked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was about thirty , extremely clean-cut and perhaps too good-looking in a Latin way:teeth too regular and white , eyes too dark and soft , a strong jaw too square , complete in every way , even down to the cleft chin and jaw muscle which rolled and dimpled when he chewed or talked . Sometimes he was with a strikingly beautiful woman but I think there was nothing to that because she was living with a sculptor in Montparnasse . Usually he was alone and always in a hurry , which was understandable considering the fact that he had over sixty paintings in each show and all three in a period of four years . Solid clean water colors of the Seine , quite simple and nice and unpretentious ; and even inure solid oils which were of Paris too , places one knew quite well , such as the bridge at St. Martin or the quail along the lie St. Louis , but which in his pictures were the most desolate places in the world , filled with a solemn green light which one might expect to sec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty minutes after an atomic blast . It was this strange , impending , doomed light and the complete bareness and lack of hope , that the French liked and not the admirable draftsmanship which they looked upon with contempt as at anything outdated in the fields of fashion and ideas . The other American GI students were guardedly quite proud of him , in spite of a certain envy  --  not of his paintings , they let you know  --  but of his ability to work , and work hard and stay out of cafe life . As a result there were rumors about him of various sorts , so contradictory that if you considered them all together they seemed rather ridiculous . If he were aware of these rumors one could never know : he was always very pleasant , though extremely serious , polite , correct , even a little formal . Certainly he dressed more like a bright young man just out of Harvard than like a Left Bank artist or an American student in Paris . Well then , he was sitting at the Caf ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The place was naturally deserted at that early hour , it being mainly a nighttime hangout for the odd assortment of strange Americans and their tobacco-hungry , occasional admirers . His blue-black beard , more like a thick paste than like a stubble , would have been surely an affectation , a rather silly source of pride for a vain man , but he stroked it immediately and apologized for it by saying that he had been up all night and had not been home to shave . Otherwise he looked , as always , quite neat and healthy . He ordered a coffee and croissant for me but wanted nothing himself . During the time Pierre had gone to fetch the coffee and bun I said without too much curiosity : " I have n't seen you around in a long time . Not since the beginning of summer , is n't it ? " " Yes , " he said . " At least two months . " He paused as though that would be all , then wet his thin lips , which were already wet , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've been crucifying Christ . " " Crucifying Christ , " I said as though it might be a well-known expression or joke , if it were a joke . " No , quite seriously . I 've been nailing Christ to the Cross . " " For two months ? " I asked " Is it a paint-ing ? " " No . I had to get a job . My GI Bill ran out in June and I went down to a foundry a French friend works summers in  --  where they 're casting those warhorses for Peron , asa matter of fact  --  and got a job nailing Christ to the cross . I had to have work . " He ex- , plained that they made every size crucifix . From pocket size to cathedral size . Stacks and stacks of them . All day long . He sighed suddenly and all the irony drained from his face , leaving his eyes unusually dark . " Well , it 's over now . " " Uh-oh , " I thought warily . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine in the morning ? " All the broke Americans assumed they could borrow money from anyone who still wore a tie and socks . He may have seen the close , guarded look on my lace for he added : " I quit . " That did not make the possibility of a loan less likely . But then he said , flatly , in exactly the same tone as before : " I 'm going to kill myself . " " I beg your pardon , " I said . It was probably another expression , like Crucifying Christ , which too would have a perfectly plausible , unalarming explanation . He looked up from the water running along the curb and for a second his face tightened so that he did not need to add another word for emphasis ; but he did , nevertheless , calmly and flatly as before : " I 'm going to kill myself . " It would have been too dramatic , indeed burlesque , to set the coffee cup down noisily on the saucer , so I took a long sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer and it was obvious that he had nothing more to say , I asked : " Do you know why ? " I E KNEW why . That was a little after ten o'clock and at a little after three he was still orating why . He was not sad . It was no momentary depression . It was something he had been considering sanely for sometime , even before coming to Europe . It was not love , money , or success . It was not the lack of any of these three . He could have anything he wanted . He wanted nothing . " Everything is a farce , " he kept saying in summation . No matter what we talked about he concluded that it was a farce . Even so , to me after a night of sleep , that did not seem reason enough for suicide . It could as easily be the reason for trying to stay alive as long as possible . But I listened not so much to his words as to the flat tone in his voice and knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that note , calm , beyond despair , you heed it when you hear it again a second time . In college I had known an unhumorous lad who said in that matter-of-fact voice that he was going to kill himself and who had gone straightway unheeded ( it was during a football broadcast ) to his room , poured lighter fluid over his clothes , set them on fire , cut his throat with a razor blade , and jumped out of the third floor of the dormitory onto the cement service platform . An ambulance could not be got so he had to be half-carried , half-walked , wrapped in a blanket , across the campus to the infirmary where he went into shock and died almost immediately . So here at the Cafe Mona I listened without alarm but with real respect to Benito Rapello 's undramatic words which were convincing because of the complete lack of emotion with which he recited them . One thing I kept in mind while he spoke : " He wants to be talked out of it , he wants to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Otherwise he would not have waited alone until the post office opened to send the note . " I would have hoped for someone else to join us to aid , but we had only one friend in common , Daphne , and she was now in North Africa . Each time he stopped talking I would ask a question , for when the silence became too long and deep he always ended it by extending his hand and saying thanks for listening and moved in his chair as though about to leave . It did n't seem a good idea to be persuading him constantly to stay or to live because if he kept pretending or threatening he would have both to leave and to kill himself for his own distorted pride . " But your painting ? " I said tentatively , knowing that it sounded fatuous to a man who had been up all night and got himself into such a state . " To hell with it , " he said . " But the reviews were excellent Even Bernard Merim  --  e 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it mean ? I can paint . I know that . I can go on and on and paint more and more pictures and better and better and better ones and the critics will say more and more decent things and stupid people will start buying them and paying more and more . But what does it come to ? Nothing . It 's a farce . A great big farce like everything else . " We talked about paintingfor almost forty minutes : the young painters who were being pushed by the right critics ; those who had real talent who were building respectable reputations ; those who were phonies who were getting there on exploitable personalities ; those who were arriving by affording chic galleries ; those who had once had talent but who now , having nothing more to say , were turning out slick phony junk and . becoming even more the rage ; those who were willing to pay actual money to critics . All these people arriving . getting there , some through merit , some not , but all arriving . And where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what it was , a farce . " What about going back to the States ? " I offered . But no , he had left the States with exactly this same sense of futility , not as acute and debilitating as now because then he had believed that the fault lay not within himself but in the essentially materialistic. , essentially anti-intellectual philosophy of the Americans . Now he knew that was not true . Their ambitions were simply different , their goals per-haps more obvious and less admirable ( to own a Packard rather than a Picasso ) , their means more direct and open . But even so , here or there it was a farce . For a while , his first year abroad , he had not understood America and had been in constant . revolt against its mania for cleanliness and against its puritanism . He had grown a beard , gone dirty , worn clothes that hung like rags . He had slept with so many that he sometimes did not recognize them any longer on the street . All in meaningless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farce . " Women , " he said . " I 've had more women in two years here than I would have thought possible . Sometimes serious affairs too , but they always end . the same way : boredom . No , seriously , " he said when he saw my quizzical blow . " After a while anything becomes boring and I do n't think I 'm capable of any real , deep , sustaining emotion , except in painting . " He paused a long time , then said without any vanity but as a statement of ordinary fact : " You ca n't look like me , " lie indicated his face with a flare of his hand , " and have a straight back , strong chest , no hips , and good legs without attracting more women than you know what to do with . And men . And I 've tried that but it 's ridiculous . " He had tried , it evolved , beer , wine , reefers , cognac , complete celibacy , and every other vice , andrhaving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone said . " Those petty little gossipers see all those things , like drunkenness and lustings , as ends in themselves rather than as ways toward something real : as a way out of oneself . " But now he was tired of experimenting , tired of trying to break through his isolation . D URING these long discourses I was try- ing to remember articles on suicide I had read since the night the stunned boy had been found on the dormitory step and led dazed and pleading to the infirmary . ( " No one believed me , " he kept saying , his eyes wide and wild , " no one believed me . " And then lying on the floor in the hall of the infirmary whispering from his torn-looking mouth : " If you only knew what it is I 'm afraid of . " What it was he never revealed . ) More people , I remembered , kill themselves in daytime than at night , more on sunny than on dark days , more on Sundays and holidaysthan during work days . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of a bright sunny afternoon while half of Paris was away on holidays . People rarely kill themselves , the book had said , on a full stomach , but Benito Rapello refused any invitation to go around the corner to a restaurant . He had a cup of tea before him only because Pierre , the waiter , insisted that he could not sit there all day without ordering . The fragrance of geraniums , a professor had said , was known to have an exhilarating effect upon depressed patients , but he had not explalined how to lead the patient to a geranium . Finally I asked what I had been wondering since receiving his note : " Why me ? Why did you decide to talk first to me ? " It sounded blunt and even accusing , but he did not seem to notice . " Because , " he said , " Daphne told me that you tried to commit suicide . " " Did she ? " I was astonished . I could not even remember having confided such information to her . Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh it was nothing . I 'd merely mentioned that you , more than most people here , seemed to know what you were doing and apparently enjoyed being alive . She said maybe so but you 'd poured lighter fluid on yourself in college and jumped from a window . " " That was somebody else . " I reddened disagreeably . " A boy I knew . " He watched the red which would not subside and half-relenting , half-persisting said : " Maybe I got the story wrong . But you have tried ? " He had no right to be asking , but then under the circumstances I had no right to refuse him any knowledge that might change his mind . " I suppose most people have . Or have thought about it . " - " But you almost succeeded . " He obviously believed I was the lad with the lighter fluid . " Yes . " I said and felt , under his gaze , that I should lean casually over and turn the water on the table before us into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : how could I admit that I had merely swallowed forty-four of what x. : ere supposed to be powerful sleeping-pills and then had ( for fifteen dollars ) rushed myself to die hospital in an ambulance to have them pumped out ? Or about the laughter of the intern who discovered , in such a loud voice , that it had been only milk of magnesia tablets ? Under Benito 's admiring gaze I sat discreetly trying to look like one who had been burned , slashed , and hurled from a third floor window . " What made you change your mind ? " he asked . " You seem happy enough now . " I shrugged my shoulders and pouted like a Frenchman . Such a complex question that any answer would be silly , incomplete , and untruthful . " Analysis , I suppose . " " Psychoanalysis ! " he spit the word out as though it were fat meat . I admitted reluctantly yes , wondering , with annoyance , why in hell some people ca n't kill themselves without having to ask personal questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis , so bitter that I knew he was extremely interested . I said nothing and made no defenses for it . In fact I agreed with him on many points : it was painfully expensive , and did certainly take time , sometimes years ; yes , some people seemed not to benefit outwardly from it , though you could n't be sure they were dismissed . The only positive point I insisted on was that it was a wiser choice than suicide . He argued on and on but always we came hack to the fact which I established with authority : it was a wiser choice than suicide . Finally and quite suddenly he agreed by saying : " Do you know of any psychiatrist here ? One who speaks English . " " If I do , will you go ? " He thought for several minutes . " For how long ? " " For even one hour . " Again he reflected : " Yes , for one hour . " " You 'll wait here ? " I asked without stressing the question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I phoned the American Hospital and asked for a list of psychiatrists who spoke English . The girl there explained that many of the doctors were out of town during the holidays . Could n't I telephone back in September ? When I told her my predicament she let me speak at once to a neurologist on duty who said I did n't want to get in touch with an analyst but with a psychiatrist and gave me immediately the name and address of onewith whom he had talked only five minutes before and who fortunately lived not ten minutes ' walk from the Caf ? Mona , three minutes by cab . He himself would telephone the man that we were on the way . Well naturally he could n't say but he did n't think Rapello would do anything drastic , not if he had been sitting talking rationally all day , but he should n't go , in such a state , alone through another night without sleep . We walked . Rapello wanted to buy cigarettes . He considered , too , going to his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely a ruse , so we went on without stopping . All the way he became more nervous : " What am I going to say to the man ? " " Just what you 've been saying to me . " " Just that ? " He stopped . " What 's the use of going ? : ' " He may ask you a few questions . May ask you something which will open up whole new fields of thinking , whole new ways of looking at yourself and at the world . " Rapello was not convinced but he followed and as we rang the bell to the heavy door he whispered like a child : " All that I said this morning to you ? " " Whatever you like . " I whispered back . Suddenly he drew away . " About the money . I do n't have any with me . How much is this going to cost ? " " He wo n't ask for money . If he does I have some . " The doctor himself opened the door and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even look up from her typing . A rather elegantly dressed lady sat nervously pretending to read a magazine which she had obviously just picked up . The doctor regarded us and could not make up his mind . Had my mask of sanity slipped ? " This is Benito Rapello , " I said hastily in introduction . " The American Hospital called you about an appointment , did n't they ? " " Yes , yes , " he said kindly but rather vaguely . " Fortunately I have some minutes . " He had a very heavy accent , clearly not French , perhaps German or farther east even . He chose his words with careful deliberation , like a near-sighted typesetter , as though he were not sure they were the words he wanted . Rapello disappeared with him into the tremendous Louis Quinze living room beyond the sliding doors . The nervous patient glanced at her watch and said in a torrent of French that she could not sit here like this that she would come back in thirty minutes , in an hour , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look up from her typing during this outpour or when the door slammed shut . Beyond the sliding door Benito Rapello 's steady voice droned on , five minutes , ten , fifteen , a half an hour , forty-five minutes . During this time I went over all that he had said that morning and hoped the wise-looking old doctor could find a more appropriate comment than I had found . ( " But I 'm simple , " I had said lamely , yet sincerely . " I like farce . " ) Near the end of the hour the girl asked Rapello 's name , address , and ability to pay which she typed onto a card . w I LEN the sliding doors finally opened and the two came into the room , Rapello 's eyes were as happy and bright as a child 's but the doctor 's face was as before : calm , sage , and inscrutable . Rapello thanked the doctor and as lie did so his face broke into an amused smile , the sparkle and sincerity of which completely startled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , Rapello burst out , and , most unlike him , galloped down the steps . He raced through the hall below too fast for me to keep up . " Wait . Hey , wait upl " For a moment I did n't know whether to follow or go back and call for the doctor . When 1 caught up with him at the corner he turned , as though still unaware of me , toward the Seine . " What did he say ? " But Benito was across the street and off again toward the river . We were almost running now and when I came abreast of him his eyes were still bright and his thin lips were twitching to hold back a grin . " Let 's go get a beer , " he said . " I 'll buy you one . " EAR the Beaux Arts we sat in front of a cafe looking out across at the Louvre . We were both breathing hard and Benito had not yet decided to relate what had happened in the con ference room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the smile was growing into a broad grin . " Well , " I said when the waiter had placed the beers before us and left . " I talked for an hour .. . " Rapello began chuckling . " I talked for an hour .. . " Handsome people rarely give themselves over to any emotion so disfeaturing and contorting as open laughter ; but for a second Benito Rapello threatened to . Long habit though straightened his face and smoothed his features again . " I told him just what I told you this morning : everything is a farce . " " Yes ? " I said in mock-sobriety . " He just sat there listening . " Benito 's lips began stretching into an elastic grin that would not stay the same size . " Not saying a word . Only listening . And nodding his head in agreement . " Benito drank off half his beer as though lie were just back from a three-day desert journey . " He did n't say a word . Not until the end of the hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do nothing with the grin . But finally he said : " At the end of the hour , he reached for an English dictionary on his desk and said : ' This word : farce . What does it mean ? ' " That was almost a year ago . Now when Benito Rapello and I meet on the street or see each other on the terrace of the Cafe Mona he says : " This word , farcc . " And I say : " What does it mean , Lazarus ? "
