Election to the French Academy is for eternity and its 36 distinguished members are known as the " Immortals . " Last week the Immortals were stunned when 72-year-old Novelist Pierre Benoit , an Academy member since 1931 , asked to resign . The Academy refused . Said Nobel Prize Author Francois Mauriac : " One does not resign from the Academy . One is immortal for eternity . " Benoit , touched by the Academy 's refusal but unpersuaded , replied : " I will never again set foot in the Academy . It would really be tactless of me . " Benoit had supported the unsuccessful Academy candidacy of Paul Morand , a novelist rejected for his wartime collaboration ( TIME , May 4 ) . Asked if this was a factor in his withdrawal , Benoit sidestepped with Gallic nimbleness : " It was not only that . "
