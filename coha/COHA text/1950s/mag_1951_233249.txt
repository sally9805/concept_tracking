For 16 years , the MARCH OF TIME successfully pioneered a new movie field : the documentary newsreel . This year , MOT stopped shooting its regular monthly films to concentrate on TV documentaries ( TIME , July 16 ) . But the old TIMES were not gone forever . Last month , in two Manhattan theaters , MOT revived seven of its 205 film essays , billed as " The MARCH OF TIME 'S History in the Making Series . " Last week , encouraged by the box-office returns in Manhattan , MOT decided to reissue its whole stock of 205 films in eleven other coast-to-coast cities , planned to include more cities as prints became available . Sample sights in store : Republican Presidential Nominee Alf Landon out to overthrow Roosevelt 's New Deal ; the rise of Adolf Hitler ; Father Coughlin and Huey Long on the stump ; the Midwest 's bleak Dust Bowl of the ' 30s.
