txt Comments on General GEORGE P. BRETT Jr.WILLIAM EDGERTON.GERALDINE CORTISSOZ.CHARLES MACKAY.ARTHUR ... Comments on General 1 Earlier Blunder . Seen To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I believe that General was all wrong in his theory that China , as well as North Korea , must be overcome or we would lose all of ' Europe as well . I believe Mr. Truman is right in his action . But the greatest blunder that was made , from which all this stems , was made when Mr. Truman committed the United States in Korea way back last June , notwithstanding that he had an overwhelming degree of support at the time . I have said this since the first day of July last year , so this is not second thought . As I said in my communication : " That is what happens when emotions guide actions . A little forethought might have brought realization that , however morally right the action was , the risks involved in what was to be gained did not balance . " How much wiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we then taken the action we subsequently did in December and declared a state of emergency to exist and made preparations for mobilization . That is where good leadership and statesmanship should have been in evidence and were n't . Once a blunder is made , unless recognized and corrected , all subsequent action , unfortunately , only tends to compound the error . EMERSON C. IVES . Pawling , N. Y. , April 11 , 1951. 's Views Invited To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Now is the time for sober thought . General of the Army Douglas has been relieved of his command for failing to refrain from speaking out and informing the public of his estimate of the situation . General has devgted his life to the military service of our country and has risen to the highest rank . He , above most people , realizes the consequences of ? insubordination , and yet he had the courage of his convictions and dared to mar his brilliant military career by disregarding the orders of his superior . He could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction in the Far East for more than a decade and a half ; indeed , he has been our Supreme Commander in that area since the beginning of the Second World  --  ar . During these many years of foreign service he has demonstrated his ability and tact and he has proved to be an arch-enemy of communism . General 's dismissal from command has divided our country into warring camps , those who would impeach our President for dismissing so honorable a public servant and those who praise our President for his courage in stamping out insubordination in our armed forces . As a result of this controversy we stand before the world today as a divided nation , and this obvious lack of united purpose can only give comfort to our enemy . We must realize , as does General , that we are now at war , that we already have over a quarter of a million of our sons in the field of battle against world communism . Each day our casualty lists grow , but there is no honorable way of stopping this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making , until we force our enemy to ask for a truce . We can not justify the casualties we are sustaining or the billions we are spending in our fight against world communism until we are a united nation determined to pursue a single objective . We have had military men before now who have sacrificed their careers for what they considered to be the public interest , and in at least one case history proved the wisdom of the General 's thinking . But must we wait this time ? While at war and under normal circumstances it.would be folly to openly debate the course that we are to pursue in prosecuting the war lest we show our enemy our weakness of purpose ; but today our newspapers and radio tell the world of our internal conflict . Might is not be well , then , to invite General to present his views at an open debate before the Congress , and might not this debate be televised and broadcast so that not only our Congress but our people might have a full understanding of our problem in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open debate assist us in presenting our for : eign policy not only to the world but to our own people , and would this not clear the atmosphere and enable us to fight communism without internal acrimonious bickering ? GEORGE P. BRETT Jr . New-York , April 12 , 1951 . Dismissal Overdue To THE EDITOR OF Tim NEW YORK TIMES : I suppose there will be a certain amount of hue and cry about the dismissal of General , but let 's keep our sense of perspective . Any military man responsible for as great a mistake as made last fall about the intervention of the Chinese is neither infallible nor indispensable . And any man who both fails to grasp the delicate political problems involved in the Asian situation and insists on going over the heads of his superiors in the United Nations and at home so as to deal with ' that political situation in his own military way is a positive danger to the best hopes of the democratic world . His dismissal was long overdue . WILLIAM EDGERTON . State College , Pa. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : An American General , having regard for the safety of the United Nations , men and money , has been recalled at the insistence of other nations . The American people did not desire his rePerhaps we are at fault for not standing as stanchly for General as our allies in the U. N. have been strong in their demands for his ouster . Now that we do not have General to do our fighting for us both in the military and diplomatic fields , we will have to do more ourselves to convince the U. N. of the need for a better performance . GERALDINE CORTISSOZ . New York , April 11 , 1951 . Constitutionally Correct Action To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMES : A lifelong Republican , contemptuous of moral weaknesses in certain areas of the Administration , I applaud President Truman 's dismissal of General as the only constitutionally correct action in the circumstances . The issue transcends personalities . It simmers down to a conflict in policy between the President and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of the issue , the President is right or wrong , the fundamental consideration in , the light of our very form of government is that the will of the President must prevail . No one knows better than that ours is a Government founded upon ? civilian , not military , authority . Disregard of U. N. To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It seems to me that every unprejudiced American should heartily applaud the President for his longdelayed , though under prevailing domestic political circumstances highly courageous , dismissal of General . Aside from the fact that was guilty of insubordination , he was guilty of the deliberate attempt to set himself against the Constitution of the United States by seeking to arrogate to himself the prerogatives of determining foreign policy . It was unmitigated arrogance for him , as the representative of the United Nations , to disregard the overwhelming prayers of the best minds and hearts of that organization for peace , rather than war . We can not be blind to the inequities of Communist schemers , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But we must always bear in mind that peace is the aspiration of all the nations of the world . It is one and indivisible . We ' are only one of the United Nations . We are the strongest  --  and let us assume the most idealistic  --  unit , but we are only one of many . We must , therefore , have respect for the views and wishes of the other nations . Those all want peace , with the solitary exception , perhaps , of Chiang Kai-shek 's followers . In short , was recklessly rocking the boat . It was high time for the President to remove him . ABRAHAM EUCHMAN . New York , April 11 , 1951 . Removal of Opposition Queried TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : By removing the most outspoken opposition , is our State Department now ready to sell the birthright of 150,000 , - 000 Americans ? What has happened to our bipartisan foreign policy ? I agree that was guilty of insubordination to his Commander in Chief , but what about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly make our voices heard until 1952 . By then , will it be too late ? How long must a nation to whom the world looks for moral leadership and the survival ' of civilization keep on appeasing barbarian aggression ? The pragmatism that made America strong does n't seem to be practiced by our State Department or the United N a. tions . That is why some of us Americans can not understand why we are forced to retreat and negotiate instead of holding ground . We are not aggressors , but do we have to become defeatists ? Our nation has been built by people who prepared a better future for their descendants . I would like to have the State Department assure me that I , too , can look forward to a future . G. S. New York , April 11 , 1951 . Removal Favored To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Thank God file President has finally removed the arrogant . Many newspapers and columnists have built him up and no doubt will still try to defend his mistakes of judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " etc . But the plain people of this country must have expressed themselves to the President , and I believe they have made their voices heard . ESTHER 0 . DAGGIT . Alexandria , Va. , April 11 , 1951 . Dismissal Called Outrage To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The dismissal of General is an outrage . True , he may have spoken out when he was ordered not to . I say God bless his courage in so doing . How long are our generals and the boys they lead to go on fighting ( in ' the words of our newspaper men ) with " their hands tied behind their backs " ? How dare the State Department ( in which few people seem to have any real confidence ) and the Administration force such a man into so untenable a position ? If England 's recognition of and trade with the usurpers in ir ) e d China is going to dictate our conduct of the Korean War and our Far Eastern policy , American citizens should demand the return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any army fight indefinitely without bombing the enemy 's source of supply and massing centers ? , How long can men in these circumstances go on while fresh troops are sent elsewhere and few if any replacements arrive to relieve these battleweary men ? It is a tragic farce . What else - could a courageous and brilliant soldier , leader and administrator do but protest ? Hail to and let 's get rid of Acheson and his underlings in the State Department , and while we are at it , the U. N. , which has proved itself as useless and futile except as a propaganda organ for the Russians . RITA MCKNIGHT . Neponsit , N. Y. , April 11 , 1951 . Capital Back in Washington To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Truman has fired the proconsul and moved the capital of the United States from Tokyo back to Washington . In Philadelphia , on this spring day , the air seems much easier to breathe . R. W. JENNINGS . Philadelphia , Pa. , April 11 , 1951 . Impeachment Asked To THE EDITOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgraceful removal of General from his command , I , as a citizen , call for immediate impeachment proceedings to be brought against the President of the United I States of America . AVERY Gnx &; Little Silver , N. J. , April 11 , 1951 . If in this instance General were permitted with impunity to ignore the directives of ? the President and establish national policy , then , in effect , we would be ruled by a military junta . The present Truman-qzmacq#Arthur episode is not unlike that attending the events which led to the abdication of Edward VIII . In each case the fundamental issue was the supremacy of the will of the elected representatives of the people  --  not the merits of the details of the controversy . And in each case the vital principle was sustained . Without emotion or partisanship , let us recognize Mr. Truman 's courageous action in re-establishing the supremacy of the civilian will over that of the military in the formulation of national . CHARLES MACKAY . Westfield , N. J. , April 11 , 1951 . Troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMES : It is indeed a black day for the country when a dismissal from service of a military genius who served this nation as did can be pulled off by the kind of a National Administration which today determines the policies of the United States . Is Congress just going to stand by and take it ? Are the people in the country going to forget the hero of Bataan and the heroic victor of the Japanese war ? Since when is it a crime for a general to ask for more troops and greater support when conducting a war ? Since when is it a crime for an American to raise his voice in protest , as did , when American boys are being killed every day on the battlefield , while an army of a half-million friendly Chinese is crying to help out and is being stopped from so doing by idiotic policies of the State Department ? Where is the " support " in men and material which we are to get from the great international debating society , otherwise known as the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has to be bought by our dollars ? And if they fail to support us , how do they dare to tell us how we should fight this war with our own men ? Is this why our families are broken up and our young men are ? drafted for military service to fight purposeless wars for the greater glory of Dean Acheson and the Democratic party ? Is n't it time for some of our national leaders to stand up and raise their voices in the only forum where they can be heard , in the halls of our Congress , and repeat with Cicero : " How long will you abuse our patience ? " ARTHUR S. Br= New York , April 11 , 1951 . President 's Courage Praised To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It is difficult to understand how any American who is aware of our democratic traditions can come to the de-. fense of General in his defiance of President Truman and the United Nations . The central issue is not whether . is correct or incorrect with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , their President and their Congress , but whether the military has the right to act or even think on the policymaking level . Such action as has taken in this matter is certainly repugnant to all we value in our nation 's history . It represents as well a cavalier repudiation of the United Nations and the hope for the kind of world we believe the United Nations can still make possible . The President 's moral courage deserves no less than the admiration of free men everywhere . IRWIN STARK . New York , April 11 , 1951. 's Clean Record To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : We are not surprised over President Truman 's action on General . To be consistent , he had to fire him . Truman is counting on the voters ' usual short memories . It is nineteen months until election in 1952 . If the usual pattern is observed , the people will have forgotten this and all of the Administration errors to date . Here is one man who thinks General is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his record clean by not resorting to the reply that is his right , but which might lower his dignity . DAVID H. DUGAN . Caldwell , N. J. , April 11 , 1951.
