TEXT OF STAND ON MEDICINE The text of the statement by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower on compulsory health , insurance and socialized medicine follows : I have received a number of requests for comment . on the various aspects of the health plank in the Republican party platform , and particularly on the question of compulsory health insurance . In the first place , I think it is important for Americans to keep in mind the fact that the people in this country receive better medical care than anywhere else in the world . We ' recognize the " local , state , and Federal Government has a responsibility to assist the unfortunate , but it must not be in ways which will lessen or weaken the benefits already available to the vast majority . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system under which so many can obtain adequate care . In other words , we must look forward to progress and expansion of the good rather than resort to any foolish experiment that would nullify what our system has already achieved : I am opposed to a Federally operated and controlled system of medical care which is what the Administration 's compulsory health insurance scheme is , in fact . It would destroy things that are essential to high grade medical service . For instance , we must preserve the completely voluntary relationship between doctor and patient . This means that there must be no intermediary ? and that is what the Government becomes if the doctors get paid , not by the ? patient but by the Government . The progress of American medicine is no accident . It has been achieved because the doctors and scientists of this country had their hearts in their work . They were doing what they wanted to do , not what they were compelled to do . They had the incentive to constantly improve themselves in order to rise in their own profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear under government bureaucratic control , because promotion and increased compensation for most doctors would come more by seniority than by merit . But still more important is the effect of compulsory methods on the patients , whose confidence in the doctor may be seriously impaired . The patient may fear ? and no doubt correctly in many cases  --  that he would receive regimented , assembly-line treatment instead of care that is tailored to his individual needs . He may well fear that Federal controls would be unrealistic or impractical because of dictation from Washington as contrasted with necessary regulation by local medical agencies , which are intimately acquainted with the widely different needs of each area of our country . The patient would find that he would be worse off as a taxpayer , too , because it would require a whole new army di Government clerks to handle the records that would be an essential part of a compulsory system . Any move toward socialized medicine is sure to have one result : Instead of the patient getting more and better medical care for less , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shown that American medicine outstripped the world on a. voluntary basis , and on . that basis  --  plus voluntary insurance plans , together with locally administered indigent medical care programs for those unable to participate  --  the needs of Americans will most adequately be met.
