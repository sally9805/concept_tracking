txt The long-predicted proposal to create a Transit Authority to oper ate the city 's rapid transit system and help the city out of its financial crisis will be put before an executive session of the Board of Estimate today by Mayor Impellitteri . The plan incorporates a tax on businesses benefited by rapid ' transit , to be paid by stores , amusement places , hotels and other types of business , estimated to carry about 20 per cent of the total cost of rapid transit 's operation and debt retirement . The levy , expected to raise about $63,500,000 , would be applied at rates ranging from one-half of 1 per cent to 2 per cent of the net income of businesses judged to be benefited . Estimates put the minimum transit business tax at $10 to $25 a year for each establishment . Real Estate Also to Be Taxed Under the proposed formula , real estate would carry 20 percent of the transit costs , or debt service , whichever is larger , while the rider , through fared , would pay the remaining 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , Mayor Impellitteri said he and his fiscal aides , including Budget Director Abraham D. Beanie , believed the authority plan as projected would avoid any increase in the 10-cent fare . " It is still my position that the riding public is now paying a sufficient fare , " the Mayor declared . The city would seek , according to the Mayor , to " divorce transit operations from the inunicipal political picture and put its operation on a self-sustaining basis . " Mr. Impellitteri said it was also only right that those who benefit from the transit system ? in this case business interests  --  should contribute toward its upkeep . Total estimated transit costs in 1952-53 are $359,300,000 . Deducting $5,500,000 from concessions and advertising , this becomes $353,800,000 . Since at present debt service is larger than 20 per cent of the total transit cost , real estate would be charged with this item , totaling $99,800,000 , an arrrangement substantially the same as at present . At present , fares defray about $207,000,000 of the cost . Under the formula , this would become $190 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount to be raised through a business tax . The Authority Proposal The proposed transit authority , as outlined by the Mayor , would be " composed of individuals possessing the necessary qualifications for operating the transit system in an independent and businesslike manner . " He suggested that the members might be appointed by the Mayor , or the Mayor and the Governor , " or by some other plan of like nature . " In reply to a question , Mayor Impellitteri conceded that " so far there is no indication whether the state will go along with this plan . " For several weeks fiscal representatatives of the city and the state have been holding confer , ences seeking a long-range solution of the city 's financial ills . It has been the plan to present any agreed-upon formula to the 1953 session of the state Legislature . It was learned that the state fiscal conferees have looked with a wary eye on that part of the Mayor 's transit authority plan that would call for having some of the authority 's membership ap , pointed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the state should avoid any part in direct operation of a local set-up which , as the Albany conferees see it , would probably be a " political hot potato . " Mayor Impellitteri was believed last night at City Hall to have been prodded into bringing his transit authority plan into the open by a charge made Monday by Controller Lazarus Joseph that " nothing has been accomplished " in the city-state fiscal meetings . Mr. Joseph virtually ended the secrecy and much of the speculalion that has surrounded the transit authority idea by coming out for it , The Controller also put forward proposals for eliminating ( some city departments , consolidating many services and renewing efforts to get greater state aid . At his press interview last night , Mayor Impellitteri expressed " vigorous " opposition to three of the Controller 's proposals  --  elimination of the Traffic Department , the city 's radio station WNYC and the city Commerce Department , " The Traffic Department , Mr. Impellitteri said , was doing an " excellent job . " Administration of this agency , he asserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lloyd Reid , and its present Commissioner , T. T. Wiley . The department should " continue on its way , " the Mayor declared . WNYC , Mr. Impellitteri said , was " performing an extremely great service in the field of education . " He noted that the station had received many citations for its efforts and was specifically commended by many speakers at Monday 's public hearing on the 1953 capital budget . Abolition of the Department of Commerce would deprive the city of a worth-while agency , the Mayor contended . Since he became Mayor two years ago , Mr. Impellitteri said , he reorganized the department and it has done " an excellent job . " The department , he said , had succeeded in " bringing much new business into the city . " Mayor Reviews Transit Plan In his discussion of the transit authority proposal , Mayor Impellitteri said the plan had been formulated by him early last summer after many conferences with Mr. Beame . He said the plan was informally submitted to the state fiscal conferees on Aug. 12 and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that on Sept. 11 , at a meeting at City Hall with Mr. Beame and Controller Joseph , the plan had been further discussed with the Controller . On Sept. 15 , according to the Mayor , the scheme was discussed with Lieut . Gov . Frank C. Moore and State Controller J. Raymond in the presence of Mr. Beame and Mr. Joseph . Regarding the business tax phase of the financing of the authority . the Mayor 's outline held that shopping centers , amusement places and other business and manufacturing plants would find it difficult to continue on a profitable basis without the necessary transit facilities to bring customers and provide an acceptable labor market . Under the plan , the business transit tax would be levied and collected by the city and turned over to the authority . " Surface transportation , " the Mayor said in dealing with another phase of the city 's transit problem , " is operated under both private and public ownership . There apJiear to be substantial differences in the economy of their operations . Among them are differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shop operations . " It is logical that a city-wide review of all tsurface transportation operations should be undertaken ' to formulate a comprehensive plan for the most efficient and ecomomical method of operation . * " Such a study should be conducted by the proposed transit authority .
