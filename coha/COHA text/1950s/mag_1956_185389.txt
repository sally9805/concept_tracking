The Chicago Tribune , which has never based one of its own men in Moscow , got around last week to setting up diplomatic relations . Off to cover Russia went William Moore , 55 , a Trib veteran of nearly two decades ' service , but not before the Trib squared the trip with its readers . Explained an editorial : " The Tribune 's reason for not staffing Moscow has been simple . We did not think it worthwhile to subject one of our people to capricious despotism merely to make him a vehicle of Russian propaganda . Now the Russians say that they welcome correspondents and will not interfere with their filing of objective dispatches . We are willing to find out whether they mean it . . . If Moore finds that censorship or restrictions on his movements compel him to send doctored news or propaganda , he will come home . "
