" I do n't need to , " Bernard said , somehow becoming anxious because of her question . " I could give you plenty  --  I 'm teaching school , and all the brats that ever lived seem to be in my classes . " " That 's a real surprise , Jean Anne . I never thought of you as the schoolteacher type . " " I did n't want to sit home and be a home girl . And men  --  I have n't met a man worth marrying . " " I 'm sure you could if you wanted to , " Elizabeth said quickly . " How do we seem to you now that you 're back  --  do we seem to be small-town and unsophisticated ? " " It 's exciting .

" Bernard shrugged his shoulders . He was hesitant to talk because of her sharpness and the tone of deprecation in her voice . He was beginning to feel a challenge in her and wondered if she should be subdued or insulted . " Your father 's still in business , is n't he , Elizabeth ? " " Oh , yes . And your father ?

" Elizabeth looked at her triumphantly . " Let 's , Jean Anne . Give me a ring at my parents . They 're in the book . " " I 'm in the book , too , " Jean Anne said with a wave of the hand as she turned to go . " It 's curious , " Elizabeth said with a laugh as they walked on , " that Jean Anne is n't married yet . She was the prettiest and most popular girl in my class . When we were in the first or second year of high school , she was being dated by fraternityboys from the University . She even went out with a collegebasketball player . And do n't think she did n't let us girls know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like defrosting a refrigerator . " " Bernard !

And Jean Anne does n't seem happy to me  --  does she to you , Bernard ? " " I do n't know . " " Are n't you glad I 'm not like Jean Anne ? " " If you were , I 'd have to do something about it . She 's ice . " Bernard was thinking that once girls like jean Anne had seemed attractive to him . Did n't they even now ? Was n't there some kind of challenge in them , in every girl of that type , that there was n't in Elizabeth ? Was n't Alice like Jean Anne ? Hell , Alice was far superior .

" Why , he asked himself , had n't he said :  --  You 're my woman . " He 's changing all of the time  --  almost every day , " Elizabeth explained enthusiastically . " Why , he sits up now and he grasps and holds things . " " What do you expect , Elizabeth ? " Mrs. Whelan said with amused tolerance . " Babies grow .

He was carrying the baby about the kitchen and talking to it softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , I wo n't try to force him , because I do n't want him to grow up bowlegged , " Elizabeth chatted on gaily . Bernard suddenly appeared in the kitchen , looking harassed . " Bernard , do n't you want a cup of tea or something ? " Mrs. Whelan asked . " No , no , thank you , " he answered indecisively . " Dish , " Mr. Whelan said gently , pointing to the dish as he spoke to the baby in his arms . Bernard watched his fatherin-law . " Saucer . " Bernard was touched by Mr. Whelan 's manner with the baby . He suddenly regretted the times he had disliked and felt scorn for the big , ruddy-faced undertaker with the slight paunch and graying temples . " Plate . "  |p179A  sweet , cooing baby sound drifted through the kitchen . They all smiled happily . " Glass . " Philip ran his right palm over Mr. Whelan 's face and then grabbed his hair .

" " Here , Bernard , I poured you a cup of tea . Sit down and drink it , " Mrs. Whelan urged . Bernard and Elizabeth had gone out . Mr. Whelan , with his shirt sleeves rolled up , sat puffing a cigar , blowing smoke rings and meditatively watching them . From outside came sounds of the quiet street at twilight  --  the voice of a child , an echo of footsteps , the hum of a motor . " Sometimes Bernard 's friendly , but sometimes he seems to close up and I 'm not even sure he 's listening to me . " " That 's the artist , the writer in him , Philip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" " We did n't know him , Philip , when Elizabeth ran off with him . It was a bitter pill for us to have our only daughter elope . But Elizabeth knew what she wanted , and she made a good match . He 's as good a provider as you , Philip , and I can see that he 's always working , and working hard . "  | " He is a hard-working lad .

" He does brainwork , Philip . Brainwork is hard work . Why , it takes me so long even to write a letter . " " Well , for me bygones are bygones . Elizabeth 's happy and , as you say , Ruth , she made a better match than we thought . God , I thought he 'd desert her and she 'd be coming back in I do n't know what condition . Well , I 'm glad .

He idly rubbed his whiskers and nodded his head . He was dammed up with feeling for his infant grandson and with regret because he had never had a son of his own . " I 'm really beginning to feel almost as if Bernard were my own son , " Mrs. Whelan said . " Yes . . . " Mr. Whelan hesitated a few moments , " maybe I am , too . Sometimes I find myself respecting him and growing mighty fond of him . He is n't harum-scarum like I thought he 'd be . And you know , Ruth , he wanted to pay me back that thousand dollars I gave Elizabeth  --  remember , the first time they came here , when his father died . Of course , I would n't let him . And he takes care of his mother . She must have had more of an influence on him than you might think , considering he 's against religion . Well , he 's different from what he was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since he 's married Elizabeth he 's stood up to his0p181responsibilities . Maybe he 'll mellow . We all do as we get on in years . " " Elizabeth thinks the world of him . " " Now , looking back on it , Ruth , Elizabeth had a lot of spunk . The University was good for her . We kind of spoiled her and sheltered her . That 's why Bernard must have been so attractive to her . The Lord knows he was n't sheltered . " " I never spoiled her , Philip . I always used to warn you and tell you you were giving her too much . " " But , Ruth , remember how I used to tell you not to worry about keeping her so clean , and to let her romp and be a bit of a tomboy if she wanted to ? " " Would n't it have been a fine how-do-you-do , Philip , if Elizabeth became a tomboy ? " Mr. Whelan smiled . " Ruth , those were just little differences of opinion we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here we both are , rightly feeling so proud of her . We do n't want to hash over old arguments of no importance . " " Yes , Philip , I guess , as the saying goes , all 's well that ends well , " Mrs. Whelan said with a laugh . He put down his cigar butt in a tray beside him . " Ruth , " he said shyly , " let 's tiptoe in and look at little Philip . We wo n't wake him . "  |p182BERNARD  sat on the steps of the Art Institute , smoking a cigarette and idly watching the people on Michigan Avenue . He felt fine and there was a twinkle in his blue eyes . Even though he would n't write one line today , the world would go on . The sun would shine and the sky would be blue . The wind off the lake would be gentle . All these unknown people on the street would go on about their business . He could loaf and dream and throw away the day in idleness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force himself to write . Then at lunch Elizabeth had suggested he take the day off and wander around and just look at things or meet someone and have a good time . Damn it , she was a swell girl . Why did these vagrant impulses come to him ? Why was n't he satisfied ? Why had he thought of Alice Robertson on the I. C. train coming downtown ? Why did he keep hoping for an adventure ? Why had he imagined meeting Jean Anne McCormick ? Was n't Elizabeth good for him and should n't he be satisfied with her ? His eyes followed the slim legs of a girl going down the steps . Silk stockings worked wonders with a girl 's legs . His mother had probably never worn a pair of silk stockings in her entire life . Surprised at his own thought , he told himself that his mother was a woman , though he could n't think of her as ever having been a girl . And now , on a day of sun and clear skies , when the streets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just felt the pores of your skin opening and wanted love and life , there she was , out in her home , a sick , old woman.  |p183His  face clouded . He shot his cigarette butt down the steps , got up , and went back inside . The outside world was washed out of Bernard 's mind . The museum was quiet , except for a sound of occasional voices or footsteps . He felt a profound silence within him . Back in 1925 he had come here sometimes , eager , yearning , ignorant , and with untrained eyes . He remembered how he had stared at pictures and statues , wanting to absorb the meaning of art . His dreams and hopes of those days  --  he still had them , though a few had been fulfilled . The discoveries of those days . . . Titian , Monet , Cezanne , Turner , Donatello , Corot . He wished he could recapture his first sudden impressions . That first discovery of Titian 's Venus , lying nude in reposed sensuality on a couch covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscapes . The feeling of joy in a world bathed in the shimmering beauty of a painting by Monet . When he had looked at some of the pictures today he 'd felt an inner strain . He 'd been fearful he might make wrong judgments , see the wrong things in them , like them for unsoundreasons , for qualities that might not be there . He decided he 'd try merely to look at pictures and to absorb something from them without worrying himself about his judgments . He stared at a Cezanne landscape . The coloring was harmonious , studied , and for him , somber , as though a sad but deeply passionate nature had disciplined itself in the applicationof these colors  --  the blue sky , the green trees , the blue water . Years ago , when he 'd first looked at this painting , it had seemed to express his own melancholy . Now it appeared to grow and change before his eyes . The hills were as though sculptured . Nature seemed composed and grave , almost to brood in color . Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importantworld in itself . It was as though the sky and water and hills and trees belonged together and had grown as a humanp184being does . Suddenly Bernard felt a deep sense of peacefulness within himself . Then he remembered how once , when Elizabeth and he had stayed in Paris late one night and had walked back to Sceaux , where they were living , suddenly , as dawn was breaking , he 'd seen a hilly landscape just as the sun had risen , and he 'd been reminded of Cezanne . The houses on a hill , distant and inaccessiblefrom where he 'd stood , the shimmering quality of the air , the greenness bunched about the houses , the little red roofs , the shape of the hill had all seemed to belong on a Cezanne canvas . He had felt the same sense of peace then as he did now . He continued to look at the painting until he was almost saturated with its beauty . Then he left the Art Institute , feelingrenewed in energy and spirit . He wanted to do something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet people . Outside , Michigan Avenue was glowing and alive . As he stood on the steps of the museum , each person passing on the street below seemed important . Somehow , Cezanne had given him this feeling of reaffirmation . This scene , these streets , he told himself , were part of his landscape . The people here and people like them were his people . He wanted to understand them , their joys and sorrows , and he wanted to compose this understanding into a memorial for them and for himself . Bernard realized that for him the streets of Chicago had a meaning he had never found in the streets of New York , of Paris , of Copenhagen , of any other city . They were his streets . And for an hour now he 'd been wandering about the Loop , gazing at people , looking in store windows , dreaming and brooding and thinking and remembering , hoping to run into someone he used to know , holding imaginary conversations with himself and with Elsie Cavanagh , wandering on , along Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over Van Buren to Clark , back north on Clark Street to Randolph , and now , once again , he was on Randolph . Peo/ple here looked no different from those on the streets of New York . They acted and dressed much the same . There were beautiful women here and depressed-looking , middle-aged women . And men with briefcases . And shabby people . And fat mothers with kids . And adolescents . And young men who looked well fed , with expanding jowls and red complexions hinting at future strokes of apoplexy . And there were all those little silent encounters with strangers . A man frowning at you because of your stare ; another , thin and timid-looking , glancing away because your eyes met his ; a red-haired girl turning away as you , in embarrassment , also gazed elsewhere ; a toothless man grinning at you as he scratched his groin ; a cop scowling ; a boy of nine or ten laughing and sayinghello ; a fat man growling about traffic . And overheard snatches and fragments of conversation . And grotesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An old woman , in a straw hat with crushed artificial flowers , talking to herself . A baby screaming in the arms of a plump , embarrassed mother . An effeminate lad swaying his slender hips and swinging his buttocks . A giant-size , handsome , uniformeddoorman in front of the United Artists Theater barkingat people as they passed . A tall girl walking along as though she were n't being stared at . An endless river of faces . An endless flow of bodies . He wandered on and recalled a phrase he 'd often used before .  --  The mere crossing of physical presences . He was filled with a sense of wonder . Who and what were all these people ? What were their dreams and their sorrows and their troubles ? And what work did they do ? What were their love lives like ? What did they do in moments of love and passion and how did they feel after sex ? And what had they been like as kids ? And had they ever faced death or measured their moral stamina in moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets six , eight , ten years ago , feeling bitter and unsure of himself , filledp186with contempt for people , glibly quoting a phrase of Ben Hecht 's :  --  The little greedy half-dead . He 'd wanted to be more than he was , and he 'd wanted others to be more than they were . And he 'd wanted to be different and superior . Now what did he want ? He was crossing Randolph and Wabash . An elevated train rumbled overhead . A motor horn honked . Behind him a motor backfired . He thought suddenly of Mark Singer and of the editors of Mass Action back in New York , and he said to himself :  --  It 's awful to live in a world of hatred . A motor horn jarred him back to the immediate scene . He was aware of a car bearing down on him . As he frantically jumped out of its path , its driver shouted : " You daydreaming yokel sonofabitch ! " Bernard was glad to be having dinner with Tom Lyons . They sat at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After wandering about the Loop and Near North Side all afternoon , Bernard was hungry and pleasantly fatigued . He 'd been absorbed in his thoughts and impressions , and now he wanted to talk to someone . Just before he and Tom had met for dinner , he 'd been thinking that , though he knew a great many people and was well liked , he really had few close friends . For he talked more about ideas , about books and literature and art , than he did about himself and his own feelings . Often his inner life seemed to go on of its own momentum , almost parallel to his social life . It was only in his work and sometimes with Elizabeththat he really expressed some aspects of his inner life . Years ago , he and Tom had been very close , and Tom had shared his dreams and hopes . Their walks and talks here in the Loop , in Washington Park and Jackson Park , the times theyp187were drunk together , their discussions about books and ideas and politics  --  now all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to talk and wander about tonight with Tom as they had in the past .

You ca n't go getting any swelled head with me . " " Why should I get a swelled head ? I had one once . I thought I was a hot-shot in basketball and got fancy in a game we played with St. Martin 's on the West Side back in high school . I dribbled when I should have passed and lost the game for my team . I got cured of a swelled head then . " " What made you swell-headed ? " " Tom , why does a boy get pimples in adolescence ?

I think that more than anything else , Tom , I always felt sympathy and pity for people , rather than contempt . " " But you sure used to go into some towering rages at the human race , Bernie , " Tom said , smiling with amusement . " I guess I still can  --  but what 's the use , we 'll always have goddamned fools in the world , Tom . " " I know it , but we were pretty damned conceited , and sometimes we must have been insufferable . I know I was . " " I guess I was , too .

" " He was a decent cuss . I was trying to make his girl , and I was n't getting anywhere . So my dignity was offended , and I asked him if he wanted to fight . He said he 'd fight if I took my pants off  --  so I did , and then I socked the poor guy and passed out . " " How well I remember  --  I took care of you . " " It was funny , " Bernard said . " I was a goddamned fool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two lamps that night , too . You were wild , Bernie .

I write books for the same reason you want to kiss a girl if you 're in love with her . I have to . I have to express myself as fully and as frankly as I can . " " Do you like your job , Tom ? " Bernard asked , as they were drinking their coffee . " In a way  --  yes . I 'm at least doing something I like , working in an employment agency . You get a chance to help people .

I think I know you well enough to interpret many of your reactions . " " I do n't know much about employment agencies , except that I never liked them . " " We do an honest job , damn you  --  go grin all you want . In fact , I would have been skeptical myself six , seven , eight years ago . Hell , nobody likes to work . " " I do .

Hell , he 'd never really come to appreciate fully how free he was . And probably lucky , too . Was he doing enough with his freedom and opportunities ?

Once , he remembered , when they 'd been on the rocks off Fifty-fifth Street , he 'd felt betrayed by life , betrayed by his own dreams and aspirations , and he 'd thought of the lake and sky and mist as lies . All life had seemed to him fraudulent . He 'd sunk into a mood of utter despair , and he 'd feared the future and had wanted to give up . Torn had seemed so gay that night .

" There 's a phrase in one of Yeats ' poems  --  I think it goesp194something like this : the face before the world was born , " Bernard said , talking slowly . " That 's damned good , " Tom said . " I 'll have to read Yeats . " " A girl with the face before the world was born , " Bernard said meditatively . " That does n't quite make sense , does it ? " " No , Tom , but I like it . " " So do I. " He thought of Elsie Cavanagh , of his boyhood dreams . " I take it , Bernie , that you 're really satisfied and happy ? " Tom asked . " Tom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess , is work  --  work and understanding . And I keep wonderingnow , back here in Chicago , I keep wondering  --  how much have I gained in understanding since I left here . " As they kept gazing at the horizon , Bernard and Tom both were filled with wonder . They were wishing for their lost years to live over again , and that they were with the girls they had never known.  --  I still want the girl I never met , Bernard thought . He could n't picture or visualize this girl with the face before the world was born whom he had never met and had never known . She was no more real or tangible , no more capable of being known , than was the misty horizon . She was the mere mist of dreams . She was music . She was a formless fantasy . She was the answer to wonder . She was nothing . Once she had seemed to be Elsie Cavanagh . That was what Elsie Cavanagh meant in his life . Now she was mere words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking of a girl . He was glad to be with Bernie , but nonetheless he 'd rather be with a girl . Nights like this were frustrating unless you had a girl . If you had a girl who was beautiful and willing on a night like this , nothing else about her mattered . They sat smoking , looking at the lake , moodily wishing they were about five years younger.  |p195THE  Carr family was gathered for Sunday dinner , and Mrs. Carr sat erect and rigid at the head of the table . She looked severe , forbidding , almost nunlike , in a shiny black silk dress with a white lace collar . Her eyes were bright and fixed straight ahead , as though concentrating on some object beyond Bernard , who was at the foot of the table . She lowered her head . Her children and her three daughtersin-lawall bowed theirs . In a solemn , dramatic tone she prayed : " Bless us , O Lord , for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive . . . . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of awkward silence . Each one waited for another to speak and for Mrs. Carr to begin carving the large , brown , juicy cut of roast beef on the platter to her right . " It 's time one of you children carved , " Mrs. Carr said to their surprise . " But , Mother . . . " Jim Carr began . He stopped and looked around the table . " Who 'll carve ? " His eyes fell on Bernard . " Jim 's oldest . You carve , Jim , " Gerry , his wife , suggested . Jim was visibly embarrassed . He again gazed about the table , seeking assistance . He turned toward his mother . She still stared past Bernard . " You carve , Bernie . " Bernard shrugged his shoulders . Bernie 's the guest  --  I mean , we 're here because of Bernie 's  |p196visit  with Elizabeth , " Jim said . He turned toward his brother Art . " I think we ought to let Bernie carve . " " Go ahead , Bernie , carve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Bernard rose to carve and suddenly thought of his dead father . What would his old man have said and thought if he could see him now ? The old man had hated him and predicted he would be a failure . Would his old man have hated him even more because he was n't a failure ? " The whole family together , " Jim said in a jolly voice , while Bernard carved the roast beef on the sideboard . " Oh , I forget , all except our nephew . " " I ca n't wait to see him , " Ann , Art 's wife , said affectedly . She was light-haired and attractive , but overdressed . Elizabeth smiled graciously . She sat almost as erect as Mrs. Carr and looked very prim . " Gee , it 's swell for us to be together like this , " Jim said . " It 's the first time we 've all been together since . . . since Pa passed away . " Jim looked around the table as though he 'd said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother , " Ann said in a sugary voice . " Yes , " Mrs. Carr said intensely . " Yeh , all together under the same roof , " Jim announced . " Say , when Gerry and I are able to buy our own house , I sure hope we 'll all be together for our housewarming . We 're saving for it now , and the raise Mr. Kennon gave me not so long ago sure helps . " " I remember when I first got that old jalopy of mine  --  I felt like a real hot-shot then , " Art said enthusiastically . " A hot-shot , huh , Art ? " Jim chimed in . Ignoring Jim , Art continued :  | " I saved my dough , and I thought of all the fun I 'd have with my jalopy , and I did have fun . " " You were like a different person once you got it , Art , " Marie Carr said teasingly . " Why , you began to strut  --  I mean to strut more than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you got your fur coat , huh , Sis ? " Art replied . " Oh , I felt grand then . I almost felt as if I was Cinderellaherself  --  except , of course , no fairy prince gave it to me . I paid for it on time for over two years . It was almost worn out by the time I got it paid for . " " It did n't get you the one and only fair-headed boy , did it , Sis ? " Art asked . " No , it was n't as much of a help to me as your jalopy was to you . But did I feel important and special the first time I wore it to Mass on a Sunday morning ! " " I remember how the boys gave you the double once-over that Sunday morning . " " You know , Bernard , it was because of Art 's jalopy that I met him , " Ann said . " That 's interesting . How did it happen ? " Elizabeth said . " Well , he almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's never been able to run away from you since , has he , kid ? " Jim cut in , laughing loudly at his own joke . Art paused , his fork midway in the air , and frowned . " It was so funny when I met Art in that jalopy , " Ann said , laughing . " It was a Sunday , and the traffic was heavy , and Art bumped into me  --  oh just a little bump . A collision could n't have damaged the looks of the jalopy . " She laughed again . " You should have seen it . " " Art certainly looked like Joe College , driving his old tin car , " Marie said . " What the hell , I was expressing my personality , " Art said . " Language , Art dear , " Ann reproved.  | " You know , times change . There ai n't anything wrong any more in saying hell in front of a woman , " Jim said . " Has your personality changed , Art , now that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Different ? " Art asked . He made a face of disdain . " Different ? It 's new , brand new . There 's nothing like it , sitting at the wheel of a new car , listening to the motor purr  --  I tell you , it 's a honey of a feeling you get out of driving it . " " Do you work on it on weekends and Sunday mornings the way you used to on the jalopy ? " " I do n't have to  --  I just wash it . I washed it this morning . I got up early and went to eight o'clock Mass to give myself plenty of time to spruce it up . " " I suppose you have a car , too , Bernard , do n't you ? " Ann said . " No . " " Why , living the kind of life you do , how do you get along without a car ? " " Oh , we live a very simple life , " Elizabeth said . " We want to get a car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every night Gerry and I talk about the kind of a house we want to get , " Jim said with feeling . " I do n't know that I 'd care for a house , " Ann said . " But then , when you 're a woman in business , things look different to you . All the worry and fuss and things you have to do , and bills to pay . " " I 'd love a house , " Elizabeth said spontaneously . " Like Jim said , he and I , we talk about the house we 're saving up to buy every night , " Gerry said . " Yes , " Jim said , " after every payday , when I bring my pay check home to Gerry , and she puts some of it in our savings account , I take the bank book out and sit and look at it . Of course , I 've always liked figures . I was good in arithmetic in school , and I ai n't made a mistake at work in I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I like them figures inp199the bank book of that bank account of ours that we 're buildin ' up to buy that little nest of ours . " They had all cleaned their full plates , except Mrs. Carr . She arose , picking up her plate . " Mother , you sit down and we 'll take the plates off and serve dessert , " Marie said . " I 'll do it . You young people sit down and talk , " Mrs. Carr said drearily . " Mother , let me do it . You rest . You 've done enough , cookingthis wonderful Sunday dinner for us , " Marie urged . " Yes , Mother , let us do it , " Gerry appealed . " I 'll do it , " Mrs. Carr said . " No , Mrs. Carr  --  you sit down . We 'll do it . You take it easy , " Elizabeth said firmly . Mrs. Carr unexpectedly sat down . The girls quickly removed the dishes . She had said little during the Sunday meal . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying how they were all together . And they were all good children . She wanted to tell them they were , now when they were all together , because there would be little time left for her to be with them . God had given her a sign . She could n't tell how she had gotten the sign . She did n't know . All she knew was that she 'd gotten the sign . It had been put in her heart by God . This morning she had gone to two Masses and prayed for the repose of the soul of her dead husband , Patrick , and the remission of his sins . Were they thinking of him now ? She had n't been able to eat much today , though the Lord knew she was never a one for too much eating , and often a crust of dry bread was enough for her , but today she had n't been able to eat much because of Patrick . The way God had taken him off just as he was going to hit her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the arm of her husband to threaten her just beforep200He 'd stricken Patrick , hitting his brain with a stroke just like hitting it with a bolt of lightning . Her soul and her life were not in her own keeping but in God 's . She was sitting here with her children and their wives , and they were talking away , about their own interests and what they were saving for and planning on , and she was here , here with the poor , sick , evil body of hers , but her soul was not here . And she was afraid of God 's power , of Hell , afraid as if she were living in the darkness at night when she had been a little child , years ago . Ah , yes , her day was coming , and it was not far off when she would stand as a child once again before the Judgment Throne of God . She was glad to have her children around her , her whole family , even if she could n't give voice and words to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an aspic salad ? " Ann asked in undue surprise , looking across the table at Gerry . " Me , I do n't even know what it is . Aspic ? " Jim laughed . " We never eat it . Me , I 'll take meat and mashed potatoes over it any day in the week . Mother , those were swell mashed potatoes you made today . I only wish I could have eaten more of ' em . " " I like aspic salad , " Art said . " Mashed potatoes and gravy , Art ? " asked Jim . " Yeh  --  and aspic salad , " Art said . " You should re-educate Jim 's tastes the way I 'm re-educatingArt 's , " Ann said . ' Turning from Gerry to Elizabeth , she went on , " I suppose you do n't have to re-educate Bernard 's tastes . I 'll bet he 's a gourmet . " " Oh , Bernard eats anything that 's put in front of him . I suppose all you Carr boys like mashed potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jim laughed . " I 'm sure you 've had aspic salad , " Ann said to Elizabeth . " Yes , I 've tried it once or twice , and Bernard seemed to like it , " Elizabeth said.  |p20I  " How do you make it ? I 'll try it some time , " Marie said . " Well , " Elizabeth said , " I heat a cup of tomato juice with sugar , salt , and bay leaf , and I add soaked . . . " " Bernard , eatin ' hay  --  is that what aspic is ?  --  hay salad ? It wo n't give you hay fever , will it ? " Jim laughed in hearty enjoyment of his own humor. " . . . soaked gelatin , and I stir until the gelatin dissolves . . .. " Bernard had n't talked much at dinner . He wanted to . He wanted to draw closer to his family , but somehow he found himself locked up . And all during the meal he 'd been acutely aware of his mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He kept looking at her and then glancing away , not wanting her to know he was watching her . " Now that Freddy Lindstrom is with the Cubs , why , it 's enough to tempt me to become a Cub fan , " Jim said . " It 's about time you gave consideration to rooting for a big-league team for a change , " Art said . " The Cubs 'll never have a team to compare with the old White Sox , " Jim said . " You mean the Black Sox , " Art shot back . " I think they should n't have barred Buck Weaver and Shoeless Joe Jackson . Buck , he did n't throw no games , and Shoeless Joe , he did n't know any better  --  they took advantage of him because he was ignorant . But , I tell you that Freddy Lindstrom is a honey of a ball player . A sweetheart . I only wish he was a White Sox . I do n't know why the Sox did n't get him . He 's a Chicago boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under their own noses  --  " " They 're too cheap , " Art interrupted . " They could 've had him for a song . He played with Tilden High School . "  | " He played with Loyola . Jackie Lintz went to school with him . " " I know , but before he went to Loyola , he went to Tilden . I know , because one afternoon  --  years ago  --  I 'd been sick and did n't go to work and I took a walk . So I went to Jackson Park , thinking maybe I 'd see a ball game because I did n't have nothing to do . Well , Park High was playing Tilden  --  it was just a high school game  --  but there was a kid playing short stop  --  he was just a kid and still wore short pants . But he electrified the crowd with his catches , and when he batted , he swung like a natural-born hitter . Well , it was Freddy  --  Freddy Lindstrom . And I followed his career ever since . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , I 've often thought to myself , if I hadda written a letter to Comiskey , they might have scouted him , and I , Jim Carr , would have been the discovererof Freddy Lindstrom . You know , they might 've even given me a season pass for tipping them off on Freddy . And then I used to see him play with a team called the Duquesnes on Sundays out in Washington Park . He 's a sweetheart of a ball player . Natural ability  --  that 's him all over . " " Tell me , Bernie , how does Chicago stack up against Paris and some of them other European cities and capitals ? " Jim asked . " It does n't , " Bernard said . " How come  --  have n't we got our lake front ? It 's beautiful . Think of it , Bernie , you and I sometimes used to swim where there 's a drive now and them big apartment hotels . Has Paris got something better than that and our parks ? Of course , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubting he was here at the family dinner in Chicago . It seemed unreal . And it seemed equally unreal that he had been to Europe and had lived in Paris . It could n't be that he , Jim , and Art were all married and were sitting here with their wives , and that thatp203was his mother at the other end of the table , old and with such unhealthy-looking skin . Yes , all of this was unreal . Life was unreal . In a moment their father would come in , drunk and disorderly . " You two must have had a grand time traveling , " Gerry said . " There must have been so much to see . " " I loved it , " Elizabeth said . " The markets used to be such fun . Food was so cheap , and there was so much of it . You were tempted to buy everything . And the people at the markets  --  Bernardand I used to love to look at them , did n't we , Bernard ? " " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his childhood , had come back to him so poignantly . For a moment he had n't been able to believe in the present , to believe in or accept the fact that he 'd grown up . And he 'd felt closer , closer than he had in years , to his brothers , to Marie , and to his mother . " Of course , housekeeping and marketing is n't as easy in Paris as it is here . You have to go to so many more stores , and then , ice  --  and , oh , they do things differently . " " I would n't like that , " Gerry said . " You get used to it . " " Did n't you ever get lonesome to be back in your own country ? " Gerry asked . " Yes , sometimes , much as I liked it over there , I 'd get very lonesome  --  and I 'd think of when I 'd be back here , and what it would be like , and what I 'd say . Goodness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris I used to think of this time and look forward to it . " " And you liked it too , Bernie ? " Jim asked . " Yes , I did . I liked the cathedrals , the streets  --  sometimes I 'd take long walks by myself or with Elizabeth all over Paris . " Seeing how interested they were , Bernard wanted to go on , but he did n't know exactly what to say or how to say it to make Paris real and vivid to his family . They had n't seenp204Paris . The drives , the values that had led him to Paris were his , not theirs , and were outside the areas of their experiences . There was a gulf between him and his family . He was trying to tell them of a life beyond them , just as , in his books , he was trying to tell people living differently , elsewhere , something about life here . And he realized with sudden clarity that he was not , and had never been , fully at home in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was all new to me  --  a new world , " Bernard went on . " You know , I felt almost like a kid during my first days in Europe ; I saw streets and stores and people in the same way I used to here as a kid . And so much of it was beautiful , and old  --  the cathedrals , the buildings . I 'd look at it all , just look and look , and I 'd tell myself that all this beauty was what men had done and had wanted in the past  --  but those who created it were now dead . And then I 'd think of life here , of the people here , and of myself , and I 'd think of how we have to understand ourselves back here and make our own kind of life . And we can do things they could n't  --  and I realized I wanted to come back and not live in Europe permanently . " Bernard stopped . " Gosh , Bernie , I like to hear you talk , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the parlor . Bernard struggled and argued with himself . He did n't want to say it . And it would mean unpleasantness and responsibility for him . " Mother 's got to see a good doctor , and right away , " he said bluntly and with emotion . " What 's the matter with her ? " Art asked . " She 's all right , Bernie , " Jim said . " Of course , she 's older . But look at the apartment here  --  how clean and neat she keeps it . " " And look at the feed she cooked us . If she was n't all right , how come she can cook such a feed ? " Art asked  | " I do n't care  --  she looks sick , she looks almost like a dying woman , " Bernard said angrily . Art blanched . Jim sat back in his chair as though he 'd been punched . " I 'll ask Gerry what she thinks , " Jim said . " And I 'll speak to Ann . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody says . She 's got to see a doctor . " " Gerry and I tried to get her to go , Bernie , but she would n't . What do you think 's wrong with her ? " " How do I know ? " Bernard asked fiercely  |p206I  DID N'T kill her . Whelan 's Funeral Parlor seemed shaped like a vault , and it was wrapped in a heavy , gray fog . His mother lay in an unusually long , black casket . Bernard gazed fearfully at her dead face , which was like stone , the Great Stone Face of Death.  --  I did n't kill her , he repeated . He sensed that he was n't alone with this Great Stone Face of Death . Mr. Whelan appeared and planted penetrating eyes on him . He wanted to run away , but he could n't move.  --  I 'm not dead , he silently told himself . The gray atmosphere was like a heavy sadness . He wanted light . Mr. Whelan 's penetrating eyes remained fixed on him .  --  He knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet he was incapable of taking one step . This was a cave , and somewhere in it there was a passage that led to a land of light . If he knew this secret passage and followed it , he could escape , and then . . . and then . . . .  --  When is " and then ? " Mr. Whelan asked him.  --  She 'll never know now , Bernard said.  --  Your mother never dies , Bernard , Mr. Whelan told him solemnly.  --  Then how could I kill her ? Bernard asked . The heavy gray atmosphere was like air turned to ashes , and the stone dead face of his mother was gray , ashy gray , the color of the oppressive gray atmosphere of this cave of death.  |p207The  cave of death grew darker and smaller . The curved roof arched low over the long coffin . He could no longer see Mr. Whelan , but Bernard knew he was still present with his watchful , penetrating eyes . Bernard stepped toward the coffin , surprised that he could walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land of light . Why did he stay here ? Why did n't he leave ? He peered at the ashy gray face . Unmoving face of gray stone ashes . Eyes like glass . Glassy dead eyes set in gray , hardenedashes . Gray , gray , gray stone death . Slowly he put his hand forward , slowly forward , down to touch the dead stone face.  --  It 's warm , he told himself in horror . Bernard blinked as he saw the faint light of dawn filtering through the dark bedroom . He discovered that his hand lay on the warm , soft skin of Elizabeth 's face . She was breathing gently in her sleep.  --  It had only been a dream , he assured himself . All he could remember was that he had dreamed of his mother in a coffin , and Oscar Wilde 's lines came to mind : And all men kill the thing they love , Some do it with a bitter . . . He did n't finish the stanza . The horror of his dream weighed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later than usual this morning , Philip , " Mrs. Whelan said to Mr. Whelan at the breakfast table in the kitchen . " If I 'm wanted , I can always be reached , " Mr. Whelan said . He held out his coffee cup . " I 'll get your coffee for you , Father , " Elizabeth said , jumpingup . " Bernard , do you always get up so early and work ? " Mrs. Whelan asked  | " I just woke up , " Bernard said shyly . " I really did n't . . . " " It 's wonderful to be able to get up so early and do the kind of brainwork that requires so much concentration , " Mrs. Whelan went on , speaking admiringly . " But I really have n't gotten anything done yet this morning , Mrs. Whelan , " Bernard explained . " Mrs. Whelan ? Why do n't you call me Ruth ? Bernard , you 're like my own . . . our own son . Call me . . . Ruth . " Bernard grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but Mrs. Whelan . His mother-in-law seemed healthy , but she did n't look like a happy woman . She was aging around the eyes . How did she feel about growing old ? Did she think of death ? Was she afraid of it ? He was touched , and he felt real sympathy for her . Would Elizabeth look like her mother twenty , twentyfiveyears from now ? She and he would grow old as her parentshad . " Do you just write your books , Bernard ? " Mr. Whelan asked . " It is n't quite that easy  --  I work over and over them . . . sometimes it is n't easy . . . . You ca n't always think of the right thing to put down . Sometimes it 's very tiring . " " How do you decide to write a story , how do you pick out your story  --  your plot , is n't that what it 's called ? " Bernard hastily tried to think of an answer that would n't be too revealing . He did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wart to admit that Unshapely Things had been based on his love affair with Eva . " I do n't have any set way of conceiving a story , " he began . " Bernard , is n't it inspiration ? " Mrs. Whelan asked . " It 's an idea , or some impression , something that happened , some character that starts me off , or I have some feeling , some wish . It 's not just something I see , but something I see or imagine that strikes me as important , and I just know it 's something I want to write about . "  | " Do you write stories to try to change the world and the government ? " Mr. Whelan asked . " You ca n't do that , " Bernard said quickly . " You ca n't change the world with a story or a book . " " Well , I read something , a review in a newspaper that said you did . " " I want to face life , to understand it , and to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His words seemed so pale . They were generalizations that seemed like sieves through which all that he was and felt was poured and became lost . Somehow what he was saying did n't trap or hold or reveal or mirror much of what he really meant . All of his shames and fears and hopes and aspirations . Sorrows and rejections and triumphs . Pains and joys . Living and dying . His boyhood , his present life , the kind of world he wanted , people he had seen , sad people , lonely people , foolish people , hard people . And himself . His mother . His father . Their wretched life . The love for , the adoration of , the need for Elsie Cavanagh that he used to feel . All this , and more  --  everything , every insight , feeling , meaning , and impression he could use , all this was what he wanted to put into his work . " But is n't there joy and happiness and good as well as bad in life ? " Mr. Whelan asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've had a kind of happy ending . I say this as . . . as an illustration . You do n't write about that side of life . " " I will some day , " he said . " It just seemed to me that there 's more happiness in life than you write about , Bernard  --  not that I want to criticize you or tell you what to write about , but that 's the way it seems to me . And there are a lot of good people , too . A lot of them live right here in this neighborhood . I know it , because I know them , and I 've done business with them . " " I do n't say there are n't , " Bernard answered . " And I do n't write about bad people , either . " But Bernard kept thinking that all life was lived in thep21framework of death . Death and relativity , the passing of everything , the pathos and tragedy of anguish and impermanencestood behind much of his thinking . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his father-in-law 's reasoning . But instead of saying more , he let the conversation fall flat . " It 's time I was leaving . Let 's talk about this again another time , Bernard , " Mr. Whelan said . " And I 've got to get to work , too , " Bernard said . Jackson Park was nearby . Elsie Cavanagh lived only a few blocks away . She did n't know he was sitting here , at his fatherin-law'sdesk , writing about how as a boy he had dreamed of walking with her in the park , talking with her , holding her hand , kissing her , hearing her tell him she would love him all of her life . No one had known the thoughts and feelingsand words that had run through his mind in his lonely , dreamy boyhood walks . How he had shrunk in fear lest anyoneguess what he was thinking and dreaming . Even now he was sometimes hesitant , shy about putting his thoughts on paper . She had been sunshine , and moonlight , and air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been like the grass and the winds and the clouds . For him , she had been beautiful , and he had wanted her , in the springtime in Jackson Park , to say just four words to him.  --  Bernard , I love you . Every day he had , watched her in the classroom , wanting her to look at him and smile . When she had , he 'd frowned or looked away . He had n't dared speak to her unless she spoke first , and she almost never had talked to him . Waking up day after day , hoping she 'd speak to him , going to school with this one hope fixed in his mind , and the day passing and no word from her , and then the coming of spring once again , the sunny mornings , the sun so soft and warm in his room , on the floor , soft on the sidewalk , coming through the class/IIroom window to lay on desks and on the floor and on her hair . Lonely days , wandering lost in his dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking to her . Findingthat special spot in Jackson Park surrounded by trees , tall , firm trees , trees much older than he , and shrubbery , and quiet . It had been like another world , a world far away from school and home and streets and classmates and everyone . Lyingdown , chewing grass , spitting it out , turning over on his back and looking at the sky between the branches of a tree , watching the leaves tremble in the wind , lying there , sitting there , rolling on the grass and turning handsprings all by himself , finding peace and happiness alone , in himself , and in his dream of Elsie . Going home , feeling empty , dull , dissatisfied , disappointed , sometimes ashamed of himself , thinking of how he 'd be laughed at by other kids if they knew how he felt . Bernard sat back in the chair , satisfied and calm , waiting a few moments before continuing his description of his character , Tommy Kenney , alone in Jackson Park . Elsie Cavanagh was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even then , when they were in school together . Why had he fixed on her ? And recalling all of this now , it seemed to him he had been desperately in need of love . A smile crept across his face . He 'd been too serious , too frustrated ; perhaps he 'd even frightened her ? How could a little girl have given him the love he needed ? He felt singularly detached . Now he could look back upon his boyhood almost as if it were the boyhood of someone else . He could face and describe it without fear or shame or blame . He could understand that what had happened in this boyhoodwas part of a lost , irretrievable past  --  a past he would retrieve only in words . Jackson Park and a girl like Elsie and a boy like himself , they would remain in his words , and he would feel forever released and free  --  free of this past . And the present would flow on . . . it would flow on only a little while for his mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Elsie . He 'd never mentioned her name in his mother 's presence . When would he go to see her and talk about the doctor ? He wanted to postpone it , for he disliked facing the situation . He became inexpressibly sad . " A tisket , a tasket , a green and yellow basket . . . . " The sound of the voices of little girls floated through the opened window . Years ago Elsie Cavanagh had been a little girl playing and singing like this , on streets like this . And that had been the real Elsie , a little girl . His Elsie had been a dream about the real little girl who 'd singsonged a tisket , a tasket , who 'd laughed and run , who 'd gone to the bathroom , who 'd been spelled down in a spelling bee he 'd won . And he had n't known her , the real Elsie . His mother . Had she played on streets like this ? " A tisket , a tasket .. . " Bernard listened , touched.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I brought a letter to my love , and on the way , I dropped it . Elizabeth came in quietly and set a cup of coffee on the desk . " I thought you might like this , Bernard . " " Oh . " " Bernard , is n't your work going well ? " " Yes  --  it 's coming along . " " You look so sad about it . " " I 'm just thinking about it , honey . " She left the room . He sipped his coffee . " . . . I dropped it once , I dropped it twice , I dropped it three times over . "  | " Bernard , I 'll get you a cup of coffee , " Mrs. Carr said with a slight trembling in her voice . " No , thanks , Mother . I could n't drink any more coffee this morning . " " You should watch out for your health , Son . " " I 'm very healthy , Mother . " " The cigarettes you smoke  --  they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think so . I take care of my health , Mother . " " Health is the gift of God , Son . It 's His to give and Histo take away . "  --  a tisket , a casket , Bernard silently singsonged to himself in a mood of deep melancholy . " Can I get you anything , Son ? " his mother asked nervously . " No , thanks , Mother . "  --  I 'm not doing anything to her , I 'm here to try and save her , he told himself.  --  a green and yellow basket . . . . " Mother , " he said , almost angrily because he was so tense , so hurt . She sat back in her chair and looked at him in fear . And down the long and silent streets , On silver sandaled feet The dawn crept like a frightened girl . His mother was like a frightened girl , a frightened child . The sight of her sallow , wrinkled face , her receding eyes suffusedwith fear , was ghastly.  --  She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mother , " he said with a firmness that surprised him , " Mother , I 'm making an appointment for you with a doctor . " " Son , God will take care of me and call me when my time comes . " God wo n't object to your having a checkup , and I 'm goingto make an appointment for you and take you . "  | " My health is good , Son . . . look at how clean I keep the house . You wo n't find a speck of dust . " " We 'll try to keep your health good , " he said , hoping his voice would n't reveal the sadness he felt . " Whatever you say , Son , " she said meekly . She was sucking on two fingers of her left hand . The sun was a mockery shining over buildings and sidewalkand splitting into dazzling rays of silver on the Illinois Central tracks in the middle of Seventy-first Street . The clear , light sky was like a lie . Life was a deception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hell , God and the devil , dreams and wishes , plans , love and affection , the aspirations of man , words , words and visions ripped like torn and tatteredflags by the winds of decay and death ! Golden lads and lasses , chimney sweepers , Caesar and Alexander and Cleopatra , Plato and Aquinas and popes and monks and slaves and serfs , Napoleon , Robespierre , St. Just and Louis XVI , Kant and Nietzsche and Wagner and Beethoven and Mozart , and his father , Patrick J. Carr , all , all among the billions who , like the Dawn Man , had lived under the sun and were no more ! Life was a mockery , and he 'd mock this mockery.  --  No more , no more , no more and never more . Soon , perhaps this summer , his mother would be no more and never more . And had n't he told her this , in effect , a little while ago when he 'd insisted she go to a doctor ? What was she doing now back there , alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I go , I must go with nothing  --  nothing but my pride . Seventy-first Street , full of a transient liveliness . Buying and selling , women shopping , neighbors meeting and exchanginga few words , babies laughing and sleeping in carriages , a transient life , flowing with words and steps and the ring of cash registers in stores , as though it would all go on forever.  |p2I5He  wished he had n't come to Chicago . Then he would n't have to face her death . Suppose he should run into Elsie Cavanagh now . They 'd go and sit in the restaurant near Jeffery . Elsie Cavanagh 's mother had died . Had it been cancer ?  --  I always knew we 'd meet again , Bernard.  --  So did I. I dreamed we would.  --  I read your story Someday , and I understand it.  --  But our meeting is different from what happens in Someday , Elsie.  --  Yes , she might say with regret . He gazed searchingly at faces on the street . Elizabeth had once told him he always looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see very much . He was looking for someone now : Elsie and the face before the world was born . Why did n't he go into a drugstore and telephone her ? What if she did n't want to see him ? What if she even hung up on him ? The other night he 'd looked up the telephone numbers of people he used to know , and he 'd looked up her number and address first . Indecisive , he stopped in front of the Walgreen Drug Store at Seventy-first Street and Jeffery . Years ago , when he 'd been at Whelan 's Undertaking Parlor , he 'd stood in front of this same drugstore trying to make up his mind to telephone her . Why not just go in and make the call ? He was being childish , sentimental , ridiculous . Bernard Carr , the writer , acting like this , with these boyish thoughts and dreams running through his mind . Afraid to telephone the conventional and perhaps prissy daughter of a smalltime bank official . Suddenly Bernard went inside . With his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cavanagh on Luella Avenue and went to a telephone booth in the rear of the store.  |p216He  dialed the number with bated breath . He heard the ringing . No answer . He waited . No answer . Bernard hung up and came out of the booth , sagging with relief . Walking on along Seventy-first Street , he realized he 'd just been a damn fool . He saw a gross-looking , fat young man in a flashy suit standing in front of a drugstore . There was something familiarabout the expression of his mouth . The fat young man returned Bernard 's stare , and a look of recognition came into his eyes . They each took a step forward . Bernard smiled . Then the fat young man turned his back on Bernard . Bernard walked on . It was Marty O'Hara , the rich boy of his class at St. Catherine 's . They 'd never liked each other . Marty had gone to jail when his old man 's bank crashed . He was out now . How gross he looked ! And once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in class had liked Marty , and Elsie had been engaged to him pntil the bank crash . Bernard looked around . Marty was gone . That , he told himself , was the person Elsie had taken rather than him . But as he kept walking on he continued looking , looking . He wanted to meet her for more reasons . . . In her he wanted to recapture his boyhood . July 1 , 1935 Sweetest Bernard : My God , why do you stay in Chicago ? Why do n't you come and join me on the Cape ? There 's swimming here , and there 's me . You can stay with me , and I 'll kick out anyone else who comes around . Now , is n't that partiality ? Honey boy , I 'd love you to come . The night before last , I was nervous , and my book is n't going well , not at all . I metp217a smalltime gangster and slept with him . But do n't be frightened . It was nothing , just a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if you were here , I know I 'd write better . I never met anyone who had as good an effect on me as you . Write me . I 'll adore your letters . One letter from you will be worth more to me than being laid by another man , even one with a black skin . There ! But , Bernard Sweetest , come and join me . I wo n't be jealous or cause any complications in your life . Elizabeth is a sweet girl and is a good wife and mother . And she 's with her familyand is well taken care of , and you could come here and work , and I could see you , but only when you wanted me to . Because , Double Sweetness , we 'll be good for each other . You 'll be better for me than that gangster . And I know I 'll be good for you . I 'm always good for artists , because I 'm just that way . The ocean is divine . Why , when I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake there . Write me . Love , kisses , and the promise of anything else you want fromAliceAlice 's letter , forwarded from Tolan and Rand , frightened and excited him . Fortunately , he 'd found it in the mailbox when he came into the house after his visit with his mother . If Elizabeth had taken the letter out of the box , she might have been curious , since he usually showed her his mail . He shoved the letter into his pocket and went upstairs , wondering what to do with it . He wanted to keep it ; he kept every scrap of paper . But if Elizabeth should ever find it ? It was thanks to Mr. Whelan 's thoughtfulness in giving him a mailbox key that he 'd gotten it himself . What would Whelan say if he saw the letter ? And Mrs. Whelan ? And his mother ?  | " Hello , " Bernard called , letting himself in the Whelan apartment . There was no answer . And then the colored maid , Annabelle , came to the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the baby , " she said . He was glad . He wanted to be alone for fear he 'd betray something to Elizabeth . He went into the bedroom and lay down and thought of Alice . Should he say he could work better back in New York and then go see Alice at the Cape ? Why could n't he have an affair with her ? Losing himself with her , forgetting , might be good for him . She 'd be new and different . That Mass Action ball . The feel of her against him . Her sensuous and unashamed kisses . Why not ? He was torn with desire . They sat on the grass by the carriage , looking off at the low line of green shrubbery . Bernard took Elizabeth 's hand and squeezed it . She smiled . He dropped her hand and looked off . " It was sweet of you to come to the park with us today , Bernard . " " It 's pleasant here , " he responded moodily , guiltily rememberinghow , this morning , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched his back pocket to be sure her letterwas still there . " Bernard , remember how we used to take walks in the park ? And how we 'd sometimes have picnic lunches ? You used to like stuffed olives then . " " Yes . And I liked the park best in the fall , walking and wading through the leaves . " " I loved the fall , too , but I liked spring best . Gosh , I picturedthings different from the way they turned out . " " How ? " " Oh , Bernard , I do n't mean that I 'm disappointed . All I mean is that I did n't know what it meant to have a baby , I couldn'tp219have known . Until you have a baby , you ca n't know . You think a baby is cute and sweet , but it 's all different  --  taking care of the baby , watching him , and seeing him grow , the way we 're seeing our little Philip grow . You think of a baby in kind of a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . But you do n't know that baby , and you just see it as you see any baby , not as your own baby . And when you have a child , it 's your child , and it 's different from every other baby in the world because it 's yours , it 's a part of you . " " Yes , a baby grows on you , " Bernard said . And Elizabeth was different now that she was a mother . Back in the days when they 'd taken walks here in the park , he 'd scarcely thought of her as a potential mother . He could n't think of Alice as ever being a mother . His mother ! He could n't imagine her as anything else . " Bernard , we are happy , are n't we ? " Nodding his head affirmatively , he did n't know whether or not he was genuinely happy . But he did know that when he would look back on this moment , it would seem happy to him . The park , the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her love for him and for the baby , the baby cooing and laughing , his eyes questioning and full of wonder , his hands like little stars  --  the memory of this would some day make him very happy , and he 'd probably want to relive these momentsas he sometimes wanted to relive those moments of his boyhood when he 'd walked in Jackson Park and dreamed of Elsie . He turned toward Elizabeth . Her face was almost glowing with happiness . How could he tell her about Alice 's letter ? If she would agree to his having an affair , then . . . but that was impossible . Even if he told her of his decision back in New York in the spring , that would make her unhappy , would plant seeds of doubt in her . But if he did n't tell her , was n't he lying to her ? He wanted to tell her , but he could n't , He knew , too , that he shouldn't.  | " Philip 's generation , " he said thoughtfully , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we going to leave it ? " " Things are never as bad as they seem , Bernard . " " We 're living in a fool 's paradise . On a peaceful day likethis in the park here , it 's hard for us to face the fact that thefuture is full of danger . We ca n't believe it . And yet  --  " " Well , I just do n't believe it will ever be as bad as somepeople predict , " she said . Then they sat for a while , smoking . Elizabeth rose and went to look at the sleeping baby . " Bernard , " she exclaimed excitedly . " What ? " he asked anxiously , as he jumped up . " Look at him now , " she whispered . Bernard saw the baby sleeping , his hands on top of the covers . He looked so fragile . Innocence and peacefulness slept on the face of the sleeping infant . " He 's just the most beautiful thing in the whole world , Bernard , " she said with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny figures movingon the golf course . " Honey . . . sing Kathleen for me . " " Here , put your head in my lap . " He lay his head in her lap and closed his eyes . Her voice seemed sweet and tender . I 'll take you to your home again , Kathleen . . . Her voice , so young . His mother . The depths of sadness this song always held for him. . . . the roses in your hairThere had never been roses in his mother 's hair . I 'll take you home again , Kathleen . . . Kathleen 's son , he thought . " Sing it again , honey , " he asked . I 'll take you home again , Kathleen .  |p221THE  waiting room of Dr. Sheehan 's office at Seventy-fifth Street and Cottage Grove Avenue was hot and crowded . Bernard mopped his perspiring face with his handkerchief , and sighed quietly . " It certainly is a hot day , " exclaimed a stout , gray-haired woman . " Yes , too hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday dress , sat erect and tight-lipped . She looked more ill than anyone else in the room . Now and then one of the other patients waiting would steal a glance at her . Bernard listened to the whirring electric fan . When he 'd been a boy his father and mother had warned him often that if he ever touched one he 'd be seriously hurt and might even lose a finger . Ever since , fans made him apprehensive . All the fears people harbored . Of heights , fans , automobiles , darkness , ghosts , hell , cancer . Were n't they all forms of the one great fear -- death , the cutting off of consciousness ? Today it was not yet his turn to fear . He wanted to tell these people waiting that he was n't ill or worried about himself . Like them , he was perspiring , but not with fear . He was a spectator at this silent drama of men and women waiting to go in to be examined by this young doctor and to find out  --  what ? Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That fat , red-faced man in the blue suit , breathing heavily , glancing about as if he wanted to talk , then avoiding any directlook , going through an endless series of little noises , move/ments , gestures . Now he was wiping the perspiration from the fat folds of his flesh once more . Poor fellow ! And the pretty woman with the shy , pale , timid , skinny girl with pigtails . And that stolid , wide-hipped woman with the wart on her cheek . She seemed so calm , but she was tapping her foot on the floor , and when she saw him looking at her she stopped . Tapping again , she tried to smile , but the smile died on her lips . " It 's the wrong kind of a day , " the fat man said with an expressive shake of his head . " Yes . " Several of the patients smiled self-consciously . Once , when he 'd worked at Whelan 's in 1928 , someone like the fat man had been brought in . The man had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'd made a dollar serving on the coroner 's jury . He 'd watched the autopsywith eager curiosity , and he 'd been pleased with himself for being able to watch without fear . But the odors when they cut through the dead flesh to the intestines had almost sickened him . The snakelike intestines , almost the color of liver sausage . The enlarged heart , looking like raw liver . This fat man might be a heart case . Mrs. Carr sat with her hands folded in her lap and looked almost like a statue . The whirr of the fan . A streetcar clanging by outside . An old man to his left with a wracking cough , his eyes watering . He coughed again . The door to Dr. Sheehan 's office opened . A round-faced , red-cheeked , smiling nurse in white stood in the doorway and called in an almost expressionless voice : " Mrs. Smith . " A sad-looking woman with big breasts rose , limped across the room , and went into the office . The door closed . The other patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this young man . Dr. Sheehan 's mother must be proud of him . His hands were so gentle he would n't hurt a fly . He had long fingers , a little like Bernard 's , and when he touched you , you hardly knew it , he did it so soft , so gentle . When he had said for her to take her clothes off , she had turned to ice . But she was n't ashamed because of the way he 'd talked to her . " Mrs. Carr , you remind me of my own mother . I used to go to Catholic schools just like your boys . " It was n't only his words , but the way he said them . His soft voice , his smile , his honest blue eyes had melted the shame within her , and she had undressed . She was afraid , but she knew he would n't harm her . And when he put his finger inside her , feeling , she had prayed , prayed to God and Mary . This had to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And she had felt shame , such shame , and prayed , and his kind blue eyes , so full of understanding of her , and his kind , gentle boy 's voice , and his gentle hands that would not harm a wounded bird , and her knowing he wanted to stop the pains in her poor sick worn-out body . And the pains that had stabbed her like a knife in her left breast , and she had not been ashamed any more . Mary Herself could have gone to a doctor like this young man . A saint or a nun could . A nun could have let him examineher . " Just relax , Mrs. Carr , relax now , and it wo n't hurt you . Just relax , " he was saying so quietly , soothing her . " We 'll soon be finished . " And it was as if she heard singing far off , a choir of angels , singing from Heaven or the sky , singing of God and His glory , and the hands laid on her were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right as she sat on the surgical table , and he put his hands under her arms and lay them flat ,  |p224above  and below her breasts , and slowly his fingers and palms slid over her poor old breasts , and there , he felt the lump , but there was no pain . He touched it and felt it , and then he felt it again . " Have you ever noticed this lump in your left breast , Mrs. Carr ? " he asked , and it was as if he might be asking about the weather and not about her breast . She did n't want to say . She knew that all during this examinationshe had n't wanted him to know . But it was as if she were being told , told from within and from on high and told by her good guardian angel on her right side that she must not lie to him any more than she dared lie kneeling in the dark and confessing her sins to the priest in the confessional box . " Yes , sir . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , I had it . " She paused . She must not lie . " Just after my husband died . " " When was that , Mrs. Carr ? " " Oh  --  not long after my son was married . Mr. Roosevelt was n't President yet . It must have been the year Mr. Rooseveltwas made President . " He felt the lump , and it did n't hurt . Thank God , God had not allowed pain when he felt it and touched it . And he felt under her arms . And his hands now on her breast again , him standing almost before her and now feeling her under the arms , and his eyes looking at her poor breasts , looking at the orange marks on them , but away from the lump and feeling where the skin was hard , and his hands , almost moving over her poor old breasts like a wind . " Now , Mrs. Carr , please raise your arms behind you . " Mrs. Carr stared at Dr. Sheehan , dazed . He raised her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her breasts again and at the nipples . " Now , put your arms down at your side , please , Mrs. Carr . "  |p225Like  an automaton , she obeyed . His blue eyes on her breasts and nipples . And him picking . up the flashlight and turning it on her poor sick old breasts and looking . He 'd even looked inside her before with that fluoroscope . She was afraid again and prayed to Mary , and the fear left her , and it was as if she were nothing with him looking and feeling and touching her , the sweat on her , under her arms , and on her face and her breasts and chest . His hands were so soft . He was a good young man , almost as good as a priest , a healing young man , and just to touch a person with his hands was enough to heal a person , and his fingers and palms moved so gentle over her poor right breast . " Now , just relax , Mrs. Carr . . . we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt weak , as if she were seeing black . She felt as if she were nobody . Mrs. Carr sagged , and Dr. Sheehan caught her as she fainted , her body flopping forward . Dr. Sheehan had a very frank and youthful appearance . Bernard thought that without his long white coat he might be taken for a respectable , conservative bond salesman from La Salle Street . He was a good Catholic , and his whole educationhad been in Catholic schools . Bernard doubted the wisdomof having brought his mother here , but he quickly realized that she , not he , was the patient , and that any feelingbetween the doctor and himself , any unstated hostility , was of no importance . His mother was with Miss O'Connor , the nurse , having a blood count taken . " Now , Mr. Carr , I told your mother that she was run down , " Dr. Sheehan began , " and that we 'd have to build her up . She 's very frightened . And I 'm afraid I have bad news for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may not be malignant ,  |p226but  after looking at her lungs through the fluoroscope , I 'm afraid it is . " Bernard paled . He did n't know what to say . " Are you certain it 's cancer ? " Bernard asked . " I ca n't be certain of the diagnosis without further examination . I 'd like to have some X rays taken  --  " " Can anything be done , Doctor ? " " That depends . There are two forms of treatment  --  the radical one of operation , and radiation treatment by X ray . " " Is n't X ray the better ? " " That depends on the condition . It all depends on the degree of metastasis . That means the dissemination of the cancer cells to other parts of the body in the blood stream . If there is metastasis , an operation would n't be of any use . " Bernard waited for the doctor to continue . " I 'd like to have X rays taken to find out if my diagnosis is correct , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metastasis . If there is , Mr. Carr  --  " " If there is , then there 's no hope , even with X rays and radium ? " " I never like to say there 's no hope , Mr. Carr . " " But if there is n't any ? " " I never know if there is n't any hope . We 'll do everything we can for your mother . " " What shall we tell her , Doctor ? " Dr. Sheehan rubbed his hand across his face . Bernard , tense with strain , drew out a package of cigarettes . As he was about to draw one out , he extended the pack to Dr. Sheehan . They each took a cigarette and lit up . " That raises the question , Mr. Carr  --  whether or not we should tell her the truth . " " I 'd want to know myself . " " I 'd like to think and I try to convince myself that it 's alwaysbest to tell the truth . But in some cases perhaps it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I wonder . . . .  |p227Perha|ps  , if we ca n't save her , we should at least give her what comfort and peace of mind we can . " " Doctor , how long do you think she 's had cancer ? " " I do n't know . She noticed this lump at least three years ago . It must have been much longer  --  when it starts in a woman 's breast , Mr. Carr , there 's no pain , and frequently it is n't noticed in time . That 's one reason why so many women die of cancer of the breast . " Dr. Sheehan paused for a moment . " You know , Mr. Carr , if all women would feel their breasts every six weeks , or , say , every time they have a menstrualperiod , and go to a doctor immediately if they feel any growth , we could save many lives . If your mother had done this , she might have recognized a growth and she might have been treated in time . Now . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigarette . Miss O'Connor came back into the office . " Well , now for the practical details about X rays , Mr. Carr , " he said . " Miss O'Connor , will you please ask Mrs. Carr to come back in here ? " Mr. Whelan was glad Bernard was eating with his own familytonight . Not that he was n't sympathetic to Bernard , especially with his mother a sick woman , but having Elizabeth alone with them made him think of the days before she was married , and tonight Elizabeth looked so young , she reminded him of the days when she was in her teens . Elizabeth smiled at her father because she was suddenly sad . He was getting gray . And Mother , too , was beginning to show her age . Poor Mrs. Carr . Bernard had phoned and told her the news , and it had made her so sad . She had n't told her mother and father , because . . . well , because she did n't , that was all . Mother and Father must think enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted to cry , but she could n't . She would try to be gay , and she 'd do as much as she could to make them happy now . Her father hadp228always wanted a son , but he 'd loved her and had been a very good father to her , and she loved him . Next to Bernard and Baby Philip , she loved him better than anyone else in the world , and by having her baby boy and naming him after her father , she 'd made him happy , and this made her happy , too . " Oh , I 'm so happy to be home , " she burst out . " You know how we feel to have you , Elizabeth , " her mother said . " Yes , " her father said , and Elizabeth knew just by the way he said it what it meant to him . " And do you know what ? " she asked , looking from one of her parents to the other . " What ? " Mrs. Whelan asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook  --  oh , of course , Mother , not as good as you , but , still , I think I 'm pretty good , and I want to cook dinner some night  --  to do everything , the shopping and everything . " " That 'll be fun . I hope it 's not on a night your father is out on a case , though . It would be a shame if he was called away from us that night . " " I think we can count on my being here , Mother , " Mr. Whelan said , frowning briefly . " We 'll make it a little family party , " Elizabeth said eagerly , remembering how when she 'd been a little girl she 'd sometimesimagine herself cooking the supper for her parents , and especially for her father . Mr. Whelan recalled how Elizabeth used to chatter away when she 'd been a little girl . He could n't remember what she 'd said , but only her way of saying it , and how he 'd been so charmed by her gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as though , for a few minutes , years were unveiled from his life . And Elizabeth had become a good wife and a good mother . He knew he had helped her to grow up . Despite the fact that she had flouted him and had hurt him deeply by eloping , hep229knew she loved him and had been influenced by him . He felt proud to be a father  --  a good father was one of the things that made life worth while , that helped him to grow old . He smiled to himself . Mrs. Whelan , noticing the gentle expression of happiness on her husband 's face , was suddenly plunged into memories of her own girlhood . She smiled with nostalgia and , watching Elizabeth , she thought that Elizabeth would have all the joy and happiness she had never had herself . And in a sad way she was proud and happy , too . Sitting in the Carr parlor with Marie , Bernard noticed how pretty his sister was , and he wondered what her life might be like . Was she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Carr was in the kitchen , preparingsupper . " Mother told me she did n't want me to help her  --  and she said it in such a way  --  " " Let her cook dinner alone tonight if she wants to , Marie . " " But she 's sick , Bernard . " " That 's why . It ca n't make any difference  --  and if it makes her feel useful , let her do it . " " Yes , I guess you 're right , " Marie said with resignation . Bernard 's coming to Chicago had unsettled her . And now this news about Mother , it just left her numb . Why was life like this ? So cruel . And the way her father had died ! That had been cruel and horrible , too . Why did life have to be this way ? She wanted her life to be different  --  she was certain about that . And she did n't want a married life like Jim and terry'sor Art and Ann 's . Did she want a life like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for that ? " Bernard , " Marie said , suddenly pale with fear . " I just remembered  --  Mothertold us a couple of times this summer her own mother died of cancer . " " Yes , I know . And I think she knows . . . "  |  --  Might this mean they were all doomed to die of cancer ? His heart pounded for a moment . But he must not give way to fear . " Mother acts and talks as if she expected to die . . . . Bernard , what 'll we do if she dies ? " " Go on living , " Bernard answered , masking his feelings in casualness . " I do n't know what I 'll do . " " You have your own life to live , Marie . " She nodded in agreement , but there was a look of sadness on her pretty face . She kept staring at the clean white windowcurtains . " Mother 's always kept the house so clean and neat , " she said drearily . " Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you be one . " Do n't worry , I wo n't , " she answered quickly . There were tears in her eyes . " Here comes Mother , " Bernard said quietly and gently . Marie quickly dabbed her eyes and smiled as Mrs. Carr came into the parlor . But she could n't face her mother , and she went to the bathroom , closed the door , and sobbed . " Elizabeth , " Mrs. Whelan began in a serious vein while theywere having coffee . " Elizabeth , has Philip been baptized ? " " Oh , yes , Mother , " Elizabeth answered instantly . " Because we know that Bernard is against the Church , " Mrs. Whelan went on . " Oh , no , Mother , no , he is n't . . . not exactly . Of course , as you know , he does n't go himself . But he 's a better person than many who do . " " But what about that book of his , Elizabeth ? I think it was called Paddy Stanton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary critic . I do n't know if they call this book literature or not ,  |p231but  I read the book , and it seemed to me it certainly was against the Church . " " But , Father , the character in the novel , Paddy , is n't Bernard . " Mr. Whelan smiled tenderly at his daughter and said : " Elizabeth , you 're a grown woman now  --  and what you do is your own business . No matter what you did or whatever happened to you , your mother and I would stand by you . You 're a mother now yourself , and you are beginning to know how a parent feels . " " Yes , Father . And being a mother makes me . . . well , it makes me at least begin to see how wonderful Mother and you have been to me . " " We 've tried to be good parents . " " You 've both been the best parents in the world . " " And we like Bernard now , since he 's your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son now , " Mrs. Whelan said , looking at her husband for approval and agreement . " Yes , Elizabeth knows that  --  and you know , too , that I have no idea or intention of trying to tell either of you how to live your lives . " " Father , Bernard is fond of you  --  and he 's fond of you , too , Mother . " " The world changes , " Mr. Whelan said . " I see it . I see that the young people have begun to think differently than we , their parents , did or do . It was different in my time . I guess it was the War . Since the War I 've been noticing that things are changing . " " One good thing about Bernard 's work , " Mrs. Whelan continued , " is that he 's home a lot with you . " Mr. Whelan frowned . " Or is he home too much ? If a wife has her husband around the house all the time , he might get in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't mind it , Mother . And I think it 'll be goodp232for Baby Philip when he gets older . He 'll see a lot of his fa-ther . " " I gave you all the time I could , Elizabeth , when you were a little tyke . " " Yes , your father and I used to take you out every Sunday , and your father would wheel you in the carriage . " Mr. Whelan was remembering those Sundays of Elizabeth 's infancy . The sunshine and the peace and contentment he 'd felt pushing the carriage , with Ruth at his side , passing people , wanting to be seen , wanting to show off his baby . But how the years since then had just whisked by ! They seemed crowded together in his memory . He had gone on as if everythingwould continue forever , without change . And now all those years were gone . There was sadness in the way time flew past . Every man must face this sadness one day , and every woman must feel it even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had missed a lot in life . For a moment he was resentfulof his wife . Then , noticing the gray in her hair , he was ashamed of himself . She had done her best with him , and they had given the world a good girl , and now they had a grandson . Perhaps they would have more grandchildren . If he lived to see them grow up and know him and remember him , he guessed that was worth something , and it made him feel just damned fine to be alive . " Mother , that was one of the best meals I ever ate , " Jim said , leaning back in his chair . But his voice rang hollow . " It certainly was , Mother , " Gerry said . " Yes , I like to do things for you children . . . . That 's what I 'm here for . " Marie lit a cigarette . She looked briefly but questioningly at her mother . Mrs. Carr smiled at her . " Bernard , I suppose all the women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's bad form for a woman to smoke on the street . " " Why , I never would have thought it , " Gerry exclaimed in surprise . " Girls here have much more freedom , " Bernard said . " Everything 's different since I was a girl , " Mrs. Carr said . " It must be , Mother , " Gerry said respectfully . " The talk , the way of doing things . . . no , it 's all different . I was brought up strict . My father , God have mercy on his soul , was a strict man . He was strictest with girls . My brother died of diphtheria at the age of twelve , and then there was only three of us girls . My two sisters are dead now  --  they became nuns , and they died of consumption . And I married your father . I almost went into the convent myself , but at the time I thought of it , my mother , may God have mercy on her soul , was a sick woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you young people would n't care to know how it was in my day as a girl , " she said with evident strain . " Oh , yes we would , Mother , " Gerry said . " It was very different , " Mrs. Carr said intensely . Then she sat looking fixedly at the window . Mrs. Carr sat alone in her bedroom in the darkness . She had excused herself from her children , saying she was tired . She began to pray . " Hail Mary , full of . . . " Then she sat staring at the darkness . When she was a little girl , she used to be afraid of the dark , and sometimes she 'd feared the Devil would come and take her or stick pitchforks into her . But she would never cry out for help , never call to her father and mother to protect her . And now she would not cry out for help , either . She would n't even let on that she knew she was going to die . The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to leave all the darkness of the world . God had set the ap/pointed time for her , and the appointed time was near , very near . She was in the darkness , and she remembered the dark room she 'd slept in as a little girl , lying in bed , sweating and clenching her fists , waiting for the Devil to sneak up on her and do something to her or take her away . Now she lookedabout the room in terror . For the Devil might be waiting for her . He might get her , for who could know beforehand what the judgment of God on high would be ? It was for each soul to go alone to face God , and she was going to her judgment . And she was going . She would go like her mother went . She whimpered . Then she got up , turned on the light , and slowly began to get ready for bed . She felt the lump in her breast . " She 's asleep , " Marie said , coming into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Art said . " I feel awful , " Marie said , sitting down . " Dr. Sheehan did n't say that there was no hope , did he ? " Jim asked . " Why the hell did n't you send her to a doctor sooner ? You 're living with her , " Art said angrily . " Do n't blame me , she 's not my mother , " Gerry snapped back . " You 'd see to it that your own mother got a doctor as soon as she needed it , I 'll bet on that , " Art said . " I 'll even lay odds on it . " " Listen , Art , Gerry is my wife , " Jim said . " It 's my mother , " Art said in retort , his voice that of a hurt and angry boy . " Let 's all try to be calm , " Bernard intervened . He was afraid there might be a fight . He was surprised , too , that his words proved effective , and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song Kathleen kept running through his head . His mother now played no role in his life . She reallyp235was n't important in any of their lives any more ; in fact , she was n't important to anyone on the face of the earth . " Well , let 's talk about the cost , " Art said . " I 'll pay for it , " Bernard said . " No , we want to contribute our share , " Jim said , and as he spoke he looked at Gerry . " Of course we do , " Gerry said . " We 'll see that she gets everything she wants , even if we have to use the money we 're saving for our home , " Jim said . " I 've got the money to take care of whatever she needs , " Bernard said . " Why did n't we notice it  --  why did n't she ? " Art asked resentfully . " Dr. Sheehan did say the X ray might help . X rays are powerful , " Jim said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother is going to die , " Art said bitterly . " I wo n't give up hope , " Jim said stubbornly . " Well , that is really what the doc said , is n't it ? " Art snapped out . " Mother has a strong constitution , " Jim said . " I do n't care what anybody says , I have my fingers crossed and I 'm hoping . That 's my feeling , and nobody can change my mind . " " Well , one good thing comes of Bernie 's marriage , " Art said bitterly as he paced the room . " We 've got an undertaker in the family . " Bernard 's lips clamped tight . For a moment he was angry . " Art , Phil Whelan is a swell fellow , " Jim said . " Listen , Art , " Bernard said sternly , " if you 've got somethingagainst me , why do n't you come out with it ? " " I have n't got anything against you . You lead your wife , I lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tongue , but he said nothing . " Oh , Bernie , I do n't know what the hell I 'm saying . I 'm sorry , " Art said , dropping into a chair.  | " Just forget it , Art , " Bernard said . " Why did n't we notice it  --  why did n't she ? " Art asked . " Maybe I should quit work and stay home and take care of her ? " Gerry asked . " No , we 'll work out something , " Art said . " And we were always thinking about how we 'd have her in our new house when we got enough saved up to buy it , " Jim said sorrowfully . " She 's not dead yet , " Marie said . " That 's right . And I have faith  --  God will save her . We 're a healthy family , and those X-rays are potent , potent , " Jim said . Art looked down at the floor . He was hurt . That was why he had gotten so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have anything against any of them . It was just . . . just what ?  --  I love my mother , he told himself.  --  I do n't want my mother to die . He felt that never in his life had he been as hurt as he was right now . " We 'll stick together and do everything we can for her and for each other , " Art said , speaking softly . " I hope Father and Mother did n't hear us , " Elizabeth said . Bernard was tired and lay back , but he was not at peace . He had tried to love Elizabeth deeply tonight , tried to find forgetfulness from the thoughts and experiences of the day . He 'd wanted to give himself totally . And now he lay under the sheet , naked , his eyes heavy-lidded , his body fatigued , his mind troubled . Love and sex did n't always bring one peace . One must stoically look the naked fact of death squarely in the face . " I 'd just . . . oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard us , " she said . " Maybe they do the same thing . " " Oh , Bernard , you do n't understand . "  | " But , honey , you wanted to stay here . " " Yes , but . . . I just feel embarrassed because it 's Mother and Father . I know it 's silly , Bernard , but I guess I just ca n't help those feelings sometimes . " He reached over and let his hand rest on her breast . " All right , we 'll make love more quietly after this  --  when we 're here . " " You do understand , do n't you , Bernard ? " " I 'll try to . " " Bernard , I want another baby , and I want to name him after you  --  Bernard Junior . " Bernard did n't answer . " Do n't you want me to want to have another child of yours , Bernard ? " " I had n't thought about it ; I 'm just getting used to Philip . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're still young , and so there wo n't be too much difference in their ages . I remember when I was growing up I always wanted a brother or sister  --  and I 'm sure it 's better for our baby not to be an only child . I even used to pretend that doll in the corner of the room was my sister . Mother could n't have any more children , and it 's always made her and father sad . SometimesI think it makes her bitter . But we can , and we can affordit , and , Bernard , I do n't mind . I liked being pregnant and having our baby . " Elizabeth 's words touched him . Her need for another child was probably like his need to write . It would be good for her . He felt he had no alternative but to consent . " Bernard , I 'm not just a girl any more , I 'm a woman . " He suddenly remembered what Dr. Sheehan had told him this afternoon , and he began gently to stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed softly and lovingly in the darkness . Rigid with fear , he kept caressing her breasts . They werep238so soft . They were so lovely . And there were no lumps . His fear vanished . " I love you to do that and to make love to me , Bernard . And , Bernard , maybe tonight you 'll give me another baby . " He took her in his arms , not knowing what he wanted or how he felt . He would forget , forget this day , forget all of the rest of life , if he could.  |p239BERNARD  wandered into the kitchen . Philip was sitting in the high chair , alternately sucking his thumb and exploringthe wood with his fingers . " Hello , fellow , " Bernard said to his son . He turned to Elizabeth . " Honey , he looks at me as if I were talking Russian to him . " " He knows what you 're saying . That 's why he 's laughing . " " At me or with me ? " Bernard asked . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all right if he laughs at me in the right way . A good father is one who teaches and helps his kid to grow up and revolt against him without hating him . " " Bernard , that 's what my father did . He helped me to grow up and revolt  --  my eloping was a revolt , was n't it ? And  --  " " Was it marriage for revolution and not for love ? " Bernardinterrupted . " Do n't tease me , please , Bernard . " " You teased me . " " You should let me  --  and I love Daddy  --  he was a good father , Bernard . " " I guess so , " Bernard said without interest . Baby Philip brushed the silver cup off the high-chair tray and laughed in sheer delight . " Good , " Bernard said . He picked up the cup and set it before the baby . The baby 239p240looked at Bernard , picked up the cup , and threw it down again . " That 's better , " Bernard said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup rolled under the table . Bernard bent down and retrieved it . He took three spoons from the table and placed them and the cup on the high chair . The baby studied the spoons and then Bernard . Then he pushed off the spoons and cup , and they made a ringing , clattering noise . " Here , here , what 's going on ? " Elizabeth asked , coming into the kitchen . " We 're just playing . " " With the sterling silver and the sterling silver cup ? " " They wo n't break , " Bernard said , placing the spoons and cup back on the high-chair tray . " Try again , Muscles , " he said to the baby . " Da  --  da  --  da . . . " " Bernard , listen , he 's saying Daddy . He is , " Elizabeth said excitedly . Bernard looked tenderly at the baby . " Your father just phoned , " Mrs. Whelan said , coming into the kitchen pale and shaken . " Mother  --  is Father all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father is always all right , " Mrs. Whelan answered . " Mrs. Cleary died . She passed away in her sleep . It must have been a peaceful ending . Why , I saw her only yesterday when I was shopping  --  she was buying a ham at Herschfield 's . She was the picture of health . Oh , it 's such a terrible shock . It could happen to anybody . Like the leaves . A wind comes along and tears the leaves off the trees . A person is no more than a little leaf on a tree in the sight of God . " Mrs. Whelan sank into a chair and sighed . " Mother , let me get you something , " Elizabeth said , going over to her.  |p24I  " No , Elizabeth , I 'm all right . I 'll just sit here for a minute . It just came to me as such a great shock . " Bernard looked on , embarrassed by Mrs. Whelan 's emotional state . " Mother , do n't cry like this , " Elizabeth said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into tears . " I ca n't help it . She looked so healthy yesterday , and todayshe 's cold . She 's cold , and they are putting needles in her and shooting that new embalming fluid into her that your father was talking about last night . I ca n't help it . Oh . . . a leaf . . . a leaf . . . " " Bernard , you must make allowances for a woman , " Mrs. Whelan said apologetically . They were having tuna fish salad for lunch . " We 're all shaken sometimes , and the death of a friend . . . " Mrs. Whelan paled when she used the word death . " Poor Mrs. Cleary , she was n't really a friend , " Mrs. Whelan said quickly . " It 's the way it came without warning . She was so healthy one day , and she 's cold the next . It 's such a shock . And she was such a big , healthy , jolly woman , and she loved life . She was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this big dinner party , and she kept telling me about everything they were going to have . I was - always running into her on Seventy-first Street or at church , and she 'd tell me all about her family . You know , Bernard . . . when a woman reaches my time in life , she does n't have so much to live for  --  " " Mother , you have everything to live for , " Elizabeth said comfortingly . " Oh , I was n't just speaking about myself , Elizabeth dear . I was speaking in general , because of course I know how much I have to live for . . . . But , oh , you 're happier when you 're young . And poor Mrs. Cleary , why , you felt she just lovedp242to live and that she was never sick a day in her life and did n't even have nervous spells and headaches . And if I had n't seen her yesterday , looking the picture of health , the picture of health . She was a wonderful woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was a little girl  --  " " She had four sons , " Mrs. Whelan broke in wistfully . " They 're all fine boys and are in their father 's business . He 's some kind of an engineer , and he worshiped the ground Mrs. Cleary walked on . He was home every night . Poor Mr. Cleary , my heart goes out to him . " Pausing a moment in his work , Bernard sat back thinking of all the pain and unhappiness and torment in the world . And somehow he felt more aware of it all here in Chicago than he did in New York or than he had in Europe . Pain and torment and anguish were among the conditions of life . And his days of pain were yet to come . He turned back to work . He was describing Tommy . Why had he given this name to the fictional image of himself ? He did n't know . In this scene , Tommy wished he had a different kind of mother , one who was young and tall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who represented Elsie Cavanagh  --  Teresa Kiely  --  had come out of church at the same time , and Tommy had been ashamed . How could Teresa love him when he had a mother like his ? And he 'd felt that he had sinned . Bernard stopped again , thinking he would write a scene laid in the confessional , with Tommy confessing as a sin his wish for another mother . Or , he asked himself , would it be more effective for Tommy not to confess this and then to think he had made a bad confession and had committed a sacrilege ? Then Tommy would receive Holy Communion believinghe had made a bad confession . He went on writing.  |p243The  new maid , Cynthia , seemed to be good and would manage things easily . She was now in the yard , hanging wash . With the young people and the baby , she needed a good maid , too . But there was n't much for her to do . She would have gone out with Elizabeth and the baby , but the news about poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephonehad rung , she 'd known it would be a call about somebodydying , and she 'd known it would upset her this way . She just had n't been herself since she had heard about poor Bernard 's mother . Poor Mrs. Carr . You only had to see her to know she had lived a hard life . And now , with her children grown and able to give her a few of the good things of life , this awful thing had to happen to her . Death striking her . But she was n't dead yet like Mrs. Cleary . The way death strikes . . . . No , death rang , it rang like a telephone in the dead of night . She had terrible dreams about telephones . The typewriter . She liked its sound  --  it was different from the telephone . She marveled at the way Bernard worked . How could he do it , think up things to write , know about people , put down the secrets of the heart , the way he did about that poor girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even write a book about her own life if he knew the secrets of her heart , the sadnessthat lay so heavy over it . She was alone with him . Why could n't she talk to him if he stopped working the way he sometimes did ? Only if she did , she would n't want him to tell Elizabeth . Mrs. Whelan left her room , stood for a moment in the hallwaylistening to Bernard type , and then went to the kitchen . It was clean and everything was in order . She looked about the room for something to do . She put her hand to her head . It throbbed with pain.  | " Philip , why , when I saw poor Mrs. Cleary in the casket , I thought she 'd speak to me , " Mrs. Whelan said . " Goodness , I could n't make myself believe she had passed away . " " Yes , Father , she did look lovely , " Elizabeth said . " And the casket ! " Mrs. Whelan exclaimed . " Mr. Cleary , poor fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last resting place with grace and dignity , " Mr. Whelan said . He was eating heartily , and he seemed to exude satisfaction . " I heard so many people speak of how beautiful she looked , Philip , " Mrs. Whelan went on . " Yes , I received a good many compliments . My new man , Jorgensen , certainly is an artist . And I never handled a funeral more perfectly . Mr. Cleary thanked me today out at Calvary Cemetery  --  he said he 'd never forget what I did  --  and he spoke from the heart . His last memory of his dear wife , he told me , was a beautiful one . It makes me feel good . I helped to ease and soften the man 's sorrow a little . " " She looked so young , " Mrs. Whelan said . " Why , she looked fifteen , twenty years younger , " Mr. Whelan said proudly . Mr. Whelan grew expansive and friendly over the coffee and dessert . " Bernard , I was thinking about you today  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to inquire into your business , mind you , but you and Elizabeth have . . . oh , you 've told me a little about things . I 'm glad , sincerely so , to know you 've done so well . But with a family , I was wondering if you 'd care to talk a little about the future ? "  --  And make provisions for my funeral , Bernard thought . " I 'd be glad to , " Bernard said without enthusiasm . " You 're young and healthy , and there 's no reason why youp245should n't live a long and successful life . But I think you 'll agree with me , Bernard , that a man with family responsibilities should think of his family and do everything he can to see that they 're provided for in all possible eventualities . You agree with that , do n't you , Bernard ? " " Yes , of course . " Bernard thought his father-in-law was going to suggest that he invest his money , and he resolved to refuse . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , I do n't need any , " Bernard said , enjoying the surprise his answer visibly produced on Mr. Whelan . " Bernard , men much richer than you take out insurance . " " I do n't want to become rich . In fact , I 've made more money already than I ever expected to . " " Bernard , " Elizabeth intervened , " you know that you 've always showed good business judgment . " " If there 's anything coming to me from my books , I do n't see why I should n't see to it that I get it . " " There 'd be something wrong with you  --  something the matter with your character  --  if you did n't . " " If anything should happen to me , the royalties from my books should provide enough for Elizabeth and the baby . " " I 'm glad of that , but , even so , I have assets and a business , but I also carry insurance . You 're young , and the cost wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's a way of saving . It .. would be a very good investment for you . " Bernard knew nothing about insurance , and what Mr. Whelan said made sense to him . But he did n't want to take out insurance because of his views on the downfall of capitalism , and it excited him to be able to ignore taking out an insurance policy . And , also , he did n't see why he should let insurance companies make money out of what he 'd pay them if he took out a policy . Elizabeth caught his eye and was trying to warn him to be careful of what he said . " I do n't need insurance . " " I do n't need it , either  --  but I have it , Bernard . There arep246lots of things we do n't need , but we get  --  are n't there , Bernard ? " " Yes , Bernard , " Mrs. Whelan said , " I think , if you wo n't think I 'm interfering  --  because I would n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mother , you know Bernard wo n't think any such thing , " Elizabeth said . " Bernard , " Mrs. Whelan went on , " you know I always thought we should buy a house , and Philip was against it for no serious reason , and now he realizes his mistake  --  do n't you , Philip dear ? " Mr. Whelan nodded uncomfortably . Bernard wondered if this suggestion about his buying insurancewere an opening wedge to entrap him finally in a comfortable , bourgeois , suburbanlike life . " But that has nothing to do with the matter of insurance , " Mr. Whelan said to his wife impatiently . " Well , Father , I think Bernard really should think about your suggestion , " Elizabeth said . " Yes , I will , " Bernard agreed readily , hoping this would end the discussion . These after-dinner sessions in ' the Whelan parlor were boring and irritating . They spent a lot of time sitting around and talking about nothing , and he was n't getting enough work done . If he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learning . Reading was his intellectual insurance , he thought , recalling the talk at the dinner table a little while ago . The evening spread before him like a gray stretch of wasted time . He felt obligated to sit with them , but he had little to say . If he excused himself and read , they might think him unsociable . Mr. Whelan , sitting opposite him in a starched shirt , his collar off , the shirt open at the front , his after-dinner cigar in his hand , clouds of smoke around him . To Mr. Whelan time , work , meant something different than it did to him.  |p247His  own work was never done . Everything was work  --  impressions , meanings , facts being taken in , with some work always unfinished , some work not yet begun , books to be read , life to be gorged up , not for itself but as food for his work . The life of every writer was one of constantly unfinished business . " Bernard , what do you think of Roosevelt ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Mr. Roosevelt has done some very good things for the country , " Elizabeth commented . " He has n't solved anything , " Bernard said , thinking at the same time that Elizabeth did n't understand economics . " What do you mean , he has n't solved anything , Bernard ? " Phrases popped into Bernard 's mind  --  " the inevitable decayof capitalism , " " the anarchy of capitalist production , " " the law of the falling rate of profit , " " war and fascism are the only solutions for decadent capitalism in crisis . " " He has n't solved the crisis . We 're building up to another depression , and we 're not out of this one yet . There are still millions out of work , and others on relief or doing W.P.A. work below standard wages . " " You really think there 's going to be another depression ? " " We can produce more than we can sell . We ca n't sell our surplus abroad  --  they have n't got the money . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whelan remarked . It was clear to Bernard that his father-in-law was seriously trying to think about these questions as they were discussing them . " I was talking to a fellow today  --  Billy McCann 's his name  --  and he kept telling me the country 's going to the dogs and that if the country gets any worse not even the dogs will want it . I know Billy well . My father knew his father . He lost his building a few years back when everything was bad . The bank foreclosed on him . And not long after that happened the bank closed its doors . Billy was ruined . But he 's come back now . His brother-in-law helped him get going in the garage business , and he 's building up a thriving business on thep248Southwest Side , at Sixty-third and California Avenue . He 's not going to the dogs . I did n't say much to Billy , but he got me to thinking . After all , in my business you find out how people are living  --  their financial status , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions that I meet many of ' em , when death comes . One man over on St. Lawrence , he was a painter . His son is thinking of buying a house . Here and there , I run into that  --  people planning for the future and thinking things are going to be all right . Now , a few years back it was mighty different , and most people thought that if they could just hold on and eat three square meals a day and keep the wolf from the door they were damned lucky . Yes , they just wanted to hang on . Or you take collecting  --  it'seasier for me to collect my bills now than it was a few years ago . Well , I think everybody can see a change for the better since Roosevelt became President , but there are lots of fellows talking like Billy . " Jim and Gerry wanted a house . They were living and hoping , unaware of the storms to come . And himself . At times he wrote with a feeling of desperation . War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He still believedthis . But even if the world were heading for its doom , he knew he would go on planning . Only this afternoon he 'd paused in his work for a moment and speculated about what he would write after he finished the book on which he was working . " I was talking to a priest who knows a lot about Russia . He said they 're all slaves there , that they have camps where they make people work  --  work like slaves and dogs . As a matter of fact , I told Billy McCann this : You ought to go to Russia and see what going to the dogs is . ' " " There 's going to be a war , " Bernard said . " What did we get out of the last one ? " " America wo n't be able to stay out . " " We will if we have enough sense to mind our own business . What have we , out here in the heart of America , got to dop249with the greed and the squabbles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . " Bernard was silent . Mr. Whelan did n't know , did n't understand what was going on .

But at the same time he realized he had his own doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Bernard , you 're communistically inclined , are n't you ? " " I think we have to have a better social system , " Bernard answered uneasily . Why did n't he bravely and defiantly say what he believed ? But it would be no use . He could n't convince his father-inlaw . And Elizabeth was watching him . " Bernard is n't a Communist  --  why , Bernard always tells people in New York a writer should n't belong to a political party , do n't you , Bernard ? " said Elizabeth . " Communism  --  goodness , how could Bernard be a Communist ? " Mrs. Whelan asked , as though she might be asking how her son-in-law could be a dope addict . " You know , Bernard , you should n't have any complaints against the social system . My God , look at how you were able to get yourself an education and come up ! I never knew of as remarkable a success in a young fellow as yours . " " But a great many people are not successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own success.  --  What do I really believe ? he asked himself . " Well , all I say  --  this Communism is bad stuff . The people of this country do n't want it . You 're too brilliant a young fellow , Bernard , for that stuff , and you 'll come to see that you are . You 've got your feet more on the ground now than you did when I first had you in the parlor . " Mr. Whelan laughed . " You know , sometimes when people ask me about you I tell ' em , Oh , my son-in-law is a smart young fellow . He was smart enough to get me to fire him and go out and make a name for himself on his own . ' " Mr. ' Whelan laughed at his own joke , and Bernard did , too . Sitting back in his chair and puffing on his cigar , Mr. Whelanreassured himself that Bernard would mellow . In fact , he was beginning to change and mellow already.  |p251Bernard  sat at Mr. Whelan 's desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth had gone out for a short drive , and he had excused himself , saying he had to work . But instead of writing he was staring at a conventionally drawn water color of a bouquet of red roses on the wall . Why was he nervous about being alone in the house with the baby ? He 'd already gone back four times to look at him in the crib . Philip was all right . But if something happened now , what would he do ? He 'd been alone with the baby before , and nothing had happened . Why should anything happen now ? Little Philip was n't sick . Even if he should become suddenly ill , he could call Dr. Sheehan or another doctor . When would Dr. Sheehan have the report on the X-rays ? Philip was n't sick , like his mother . He could n't die before Elizabeth returned ; they 'd only gone for a short drive . Why could n't he quiet these irrational worries ? Elizabeth sometimes worried about the baby , but not quite like this . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other women did , too . They were n't afraid of their responsibilities as parents . Was he afraid ? He wished they 'd come back soon . With Elizabeth or her mother here he would n't feel solely responsible . If he were tormented and distracted like this , merely staying here while the baby slept , how would he act if anything serious happened ?  --  Bernard , you 're no son of mine ! He remembered how often his father used to say that to him . And now his father was dead , decayed flesh and bones , worms and dust . And his mother ? He should n't have been so afraid of them . He should have pitied them . How would his own son regard him ? He had a queasy sensation in his stomach . Bernard stared at the heavy , polished furniture and the many small objects on the mantelpiece . He did n't belong here . He used to tell himself this when he 'd been a boy . Where did he belong ? And was n't his drive to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win a feeling of belonging ? He wanted to belong  --  in history . The quiet of the apartment was so ominous that it seemed like a dangerous presence . As a boy , he 'd sometimes felt this way . That time when he was ten and Jim and Art had gone to a movie . The old man had forbidden him permission to go with them . He had n't done anything to deserve the punishment , but the old man had singled him out unfairly . He 'd thought of sneaking out and defying his father , but he 'd been afraid to , and he 'd asked his mother to let him go , but she 'd told him his father 's command must be obeyed . It had been a Friday night , and suddenly , alone in the parlor , he 'd become so terrified . . . . He waited for something to happen to him , someone to come and hurt him . He 'd sat , fixed in his chair . . . . Bernard tried to recall other details and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd especially wanted to go to the movie because he 'd been hoping to see Elsie Cavanagh , and he 'd convinced himself that if he 'd see her at the movie on that particular evening she 'd talk to him . He 'd imagined that meeting her would change his life . And this had all happened when his old man had been hitting the bottle heavily . In those days he 'd often cowered in fear of his father , and he 'd sometimes blamed his mother for not protectinghim . This was all so far away now . It was gone . He was bringingit back in memory , recreating it in words  --  all the fears and hopes , all that hungering and dreaming for love . Little Philip would have his own boyhood . He would try to make it different from his  --  different from his own lost and betrayed past . " Bernard , sometimes I think you do n't care for anyone but yourself , " Elizabeth said in great irritation . " Doing my work is n't a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p253This  quarrel seemed so childish that he could n't respond to Elizabeth 's anger . It was a beautiful , peaceful night , and they were taking a walk along Seventy-first . People were strolling about lazily . There was really nothing for them to quarrel over . Their baby was home asleep , and if he needed anything Mr. Whelan was there to take care of him . Bernard felt good . He wanted to wander about with Elizabeth , to make the most of this aimless walk , to absorb the evening . But here they were , quarreling . And he did n't know what it was all about . " You 're always talking about your work , and having to work , and of course I want you to , and I let you work  --  but what about me ? " " Honey , you know I love you . " " Bernard Carr , you know you just did n't want to go out for a drive with my father and mother  --  you know it just as sure as you know there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true , " he answered . " It is , and you know it is , and you were mean , mean and selfish tonight . " " But I asked you , and you said it was all right if I did n't come along . Now you want to fight with me . Anyway , someone had to stay home with the baby . " " We could have taken the baby along . " An elderly couple turned to stare at them , and Bernard was embarrassed . " Honey , please , let 's drop it . It 's a beautiful night , let 's enjoy it and cut out this idiotic quarreling . " " Father and Mother have been very nice to both of us . " " I did n't do anything to them . They did n't seem to mind my staying home . " " Well , I just happen to know that they did . " " Did they say anything ? " " No  --  they never talk about you except to praise you . Even after what you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was telling me how I should see top254it that you ate the right food so you 'd be healthy . And you act as if you did n't like my father . " " I do n't dislike him . " " You are n't even careful and tactful in what you say to him . " " When was I tactless ? And why in hell do I always have to be tactful  --  let others be tactful sometimes . Instead of my always sparing their ideas and feelings and prejudices , let them consider mine . If someone else expresses ideas I do n't like , why should n't I tell them what I think instead of consideringwhether my ideas will make them angry ? " " I never knew you could be so mean . " She seemed about to burst into tears . " And this is the way you treat me when I ask you to take me out for a walk ! " " Well , I am taking you out for a walk . " " Yes , but you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I 'm not fighting with you . " " I did n't start it  --  you did . " " People are looking at us  --  you do n't want to scandalize the neighborhood , do you ? " " Bernard Carr  --  I hate you . " They turned the corner at Jeffery Avenue . " I would n't have said a thing if you 'd only acted just a little different with Mother and Father . " " Honey , this is silly  --  it 's idiotic . Let 's stop it and  --  " " But , Bernard , you were nasty to me . " " No more than you were to me . " He determined not to become annoyed . " Bernard , even though I am your wife , I do n't think you think I 'm important . . . . Maybe you do n't think anyone is important , just your work  --  " He took her and kissed her . She melted with pleasure . " You kissed me on Jeffery Avenue , " she said coyly , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on toward Jackson Park , laughing together . They were sitting on Bernard 's coat . Rumpled and silent , Elizabeth lay with her head on his shoulder . Though he felt at peace with the world , at the same time he felt disillusioned . He thought of death . If it could come at such a time as this , in a sweetness of fatigue and spent emotions , a slow and painlessexhaustion here where he 'd dreamed of love as a boy , here and now , when the world was so beautiful and peaceful . The blue sky was lavish with stars . And trees , darkness , a blue-gray mist and moonlight , soft winds from Lake Michiganplaying on the leaves and running so caressingly through his hair . They had come here to his special spot in Jackson Park . They had kissed and loved and abandoned themselves to each other , and they had been as close and as ecstatic as it was possible to be , and now they sat close together , silent and sleepy . There was no more than this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the stars , and then to sit under these same stars and with resignation to know that there was no more . This , this was all there could be . And this , too , was the real content of those boyhood dreams . Elizabeth breathing softly , with her head on his shoulder , had given him what he 'd wanted from Elsie Cavanagh . She had made his boyhood dreams come true . Almost all his dreams had come true . He 'd found the limit of his dreams . This was it . This tired , lonely feeling of calm and of emptiness without irritation . This looking at the stars , looking at stars like dust , gray and white and small and powdery . This looking at moonlight , and the trees black against the night , the tall shapes of the trees . The dewy grass and Elizabeth , with his arm around her . " I feel so wonderful , " she said softly . He could make her feel wonderful . Did he feel wonderful ? No , not exactly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was glad to be alive and to be what he was . He wanted to sit here with Elizabeth for a long time . This hush . The hushed starlit night . The two of them huddled together here , slowly recovering their normal selves . Darkness . And the trees , dark black shapes , black friendly shapes filled with a life given to them by the lake winds , with a damp smell that was like some odor of freedom , an odor coming from a world free and far away because it was unknown , the odor of the world beyond the horizon , and the wind itself , a quiet wind from that same world beyond the horizon . Beyond the horizon in his life was , and perhaps alwayswould be , the horizon of Lake Michigan when the waterswere blue and waveless or black , blue , and silver with the reflections of the moonlight . The rustling leaves , the wind in the quivering leaves . This was not a song of the wind . It was a life , a life outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the language of the universe . The universe was speaking to him , but only in notes of sadness , and yet it sounded like a language of love . And tonight , yes , it had all been new , and the world was new once again . Here , now , in his special spot of boyhood dedication to Elsie , he was sitting in this after-moment with Elizabeth . He did n't feel guilty . He was n't ashamed.  --  I must love her to feel like this . " Bernard ? " " Yes , honey ? " " Oh , I was just saying your name . It 's a lovely name . I was just talking to myself . . . Bernard and Elizabeth . . It could have been no better with Eva , with Elsie . It could n't be with Alice . This was all there was . This and no more . And this did n't come so often . For this he had wanted Alice , for this newness of love . He 'd been right not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell Elizabeth about it , but he would n't . She 'd never know . " And I 'm still part of you , Bernard . I am . Bernard , we 're one.  |p257She  snuggled against him . " Bernard , " she said with a note of sadness in her voice , " I never want to go back . " " Never go back . . . where ? " " To the world . " They listened to the wind in the trees . " No , it 's as though we are nowhere now , " he said almost in a whisper . " We 're . . . Bernard , maybe it 's silly to say it , but now we 're just us . " " Yes , " he agreed softly . Above him each leaf stirred , and each leaf was an individual sounding board of the wind . He gazed up . The leaves were part of dark and fantastic forms surrounding him , standing against the sky , pointed against the dark and misty air , and he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw the dark leaves stirring , and one , glittering with reflected moonlight , looked like a star . He kept gazing up and wishing he could communicate with the leaves , the trees , the sky , the wind . " Bernard , I 'd like to . . . talk to the sky now . " " We can only talk to each other . " " Do n't talk to me , Bernard , kiss me . " He kissed her . She nestled in his arms . She could be talked to , and yet there were walls even here , walls blocking out communication . One was alone , always alone , even in these after-moments . They sat for some time . Then they rose . Elizabeth smoothed out her clothes and fixed her hair . " You mussed me all up , " she teased , " and I 'm damp . " He flicked his thumb under her chin . They walked slowly away . " Now we 're going back to the world , " he said crisply . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm and drawingclose to him.  |  --  How soon will he come ? Bernard asked himself agonizingly . Wearing his pajamas and bathrobe , Bernard moved nervouslyabout the Whelan parlor . He dropped wearily into a chair . Never in his life , he thought , had he felt so utterly helpless as he did this minute . He jumped up and went to the window.  --  When will Dr. Sheehan come ? The street was dark and deserted . The apartment building opposite was dark . He saw headlights of a car growing larger , and the car coming closer . Was it the doctor ? The car passed on . He sighed and turned from the window . He 'd looked at the thermometer three times after Elizabeth had taken little Philip 's temperature . A hundred and five . Just looking at the baby , it was apparent he was ill . Was it pneumonia ? Or could it be appendicitis ? If it were , how could the doctor diagnose it ? And what if Philip died ? He got up but sat down again immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this distraught state . He should be calm and collected , master of the situation . Hell , he was helpless and afraid . His baby had a temperature of one hundred and five and might be dying . He did n't know what was the matter with Baby Philip . He did n't know what to do . There was nothing for him to do . Nothing but wait for the doctor . Mr. Whelan , also in bathrobe and pajamas , came into the parlor . " Dr. Sheehan will be here any minute now , " he said calmly and reassuringly . " I hope so . " Bernard envied Mr. Whelan his composure , and he somehowgained assurance from it . He felt better because his father-in-lawwas home . They were n't alone , he and Elizabeth . " Babies often run high temperatures , and it does n't meanp259they 're seriously ill . Their temperatures can shoot up in no time and be down the next morning . I saw it happen often with Elizabeth when she was an infant . " " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " For you or me , a temperature like the baby 's would be damned serious , but it does n't always mean that with a baby , " Mr. Whelan said gently . " I remember once when Elizabeth was  --  oh , she was about six months old or so , maybe a little older , but it was in her first year , I remember that clearly  --  and she started running a high fever at night . I was mighty worried , so , and then he halted in confusion . Mr. Whelan smiled at him understandingly . " So you do n't think it 's necessarily serious ? " " We 'll have to wait for Dr. Sheehan to tell us . " " He was coughing . " " The little fellow is sick , all right . But it may be only a cold , and Tim Sheehan is a crackerjack of a doctor . He 'll take care of little Philip . " " Yes , I have faith in him . " Bernard rose . He stood , awkward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As Bernard left the parlor , Mr. Whelan followed him with sympathetic eyes . Then he rose slowly and walked to the window . He stood opening and closing his hands as he watched for the doctor 's car . The baby was listless , and his eyes shone with fever . His cheeks were flushed . He lay quietly , breathing heavily , and now and then wheezing or whimpering in a low , soft tone . He looked so pathetically helpless . His big eyes appeared to stare at nothing , but they seemed to be asking for something , as if he were pleading for help , for relief , for protection . Gazing at his infant son , Bernard touched the feverish , damp cheek . The baby whimpered again.  |  --  Christ , I want him to get better , he must get better , he said to himself almost frantically . Elizabeth came and stood beside him . She exclaimed in a soft , but very agitated tone of voice : " Oh , my little precious darling  --  oh , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm around her , and they both gazed helplesslyat the baby.  --  If Baby Philip should die , he thought , it would be an unspeakable wrong . He looked sidewise at Elizabeth . Would she be able to stand it ?  --  Would I ? he asked himself . He remembered their stillborn baby in 1932 , the pain he had felt , and Elizabeth 's sadness , her crying spells , those terriblemoments when she had seemed almost mad with desperationand agony . The baby coughed , and it seemed to tear at them both . Mrs. Whelan came in quietly and looked at Baby Philip , too . " He must have a bad cold or the flu , the little precious , " she said . Elizabeth turned to look at her mother for help . Mrs. Whelanput her arms around her daughter and held her . The bell rang , and all three of them quickly moved toward the door of the room . When , how soon , how much longer , before he 'd hear the verdict ? But why , he asked himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Bernard and Mr. Whelan were waiting in the parlor . Elizabethand Mrs. Whelan were with Dr. Sheehan , who was examiningthe baby . Bernard felt that his life had come to a standstill since the baby had awakened them with a shriek about an hour ago and Elizabeth had discovered he was ill . All he had achieved ,  |p261read  , or thought now seemed to have no meaning . Each secondwas like a thumping heartbeat . He could only sit and wait , feeling hurt and useless . Never in his life had he felt so powerless . Dr. Sheehan came into the parlor , smiling broadly . Elizabethand Mrs. Whelan followed . " Well , the baby has a respiratory infection , " Dr. Sheehan said . He looked at Bernard warmly . " I 've given him some aspirin , and he 's sleeping . I do n't think it 's anything to worry about , and his temperature ought to be down by morning . " Bernard wanted to ask some questions but was tonguetied . He wanted more information , but he did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor had said . He smiled gratefully . " And it is n't . . . is n't serious , Doctor ? " he asked , feelingfoolish . Dr. Sheehan smiled at Bernard as though he were a child . Bernard looked at the doctor with sudden admiration . Dr. Sheehan could make decisions about health and illness , about life and death , with calm and confidence . And in a situation like this he himself was completely ignorant ; about the most basic and fundamental questions he knew nothing . He felt chastened and totally superfluous . Sitting in the kitchen , Bernard thought they were really a family . Never before had he experienced so close a family feeling as now . He 'd relied on them all to help , and to know what to do if the baby were seriously or dangerously ill . He 'd looked to Elizabeth and to her parents for support , feeling they would know better than he what to do . But , hell , he 'd just been glad to be with them . He was grateful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " Elizabeth said in a manner that was both superior and affectionate . " We were all worried , " Mr. Whelan cut in.  | " I did n't know what it was . . . I was damned worried , " Bernard said . " You must have felt the same way when Baby Philip was born . . . did n't you , Bernard ? " Mr. Whelan asked . Bernard grinned . Then he turned and looked at Elizabeth tenderly and possessively . She seemed so different now from what she had been like in the park . She was a mother now and not what she 'd been in his arms . Was she thinking of that now ? She might have become pregnant tonight . But if she had , could it have happened at a better time ? He 'd loved her in Jackson Park more deeply and fully than ever before . Why did he feel so sad ? " Your father is pretty good , I 'll say that , " Mrs. Whelan said . " But there are emergencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Whelan said , smiling with gentle amusement . " A man ca n't be a mother . A sick child needs a mother . . . or a grandmother . " " And little Philip has both . " " The Lord willing , maybe he 'll have both for a long time to come , " Mr. Whelan said.  --  His own mother ? How long would she live ? Dr. Sheehan had said just before leaving that he was waiting for the X-rays . As they went on chatting , Bernard only half listened . It was comfortable sitting here . He felt both at ease and remote . He did n't want to go back to bed , even though it was after three o'clock . Apparently the others did n't either ; they all seemed drawn closer and to be basking in a new-foundwarmth . Little Philip was laughing and making ferocious noises in his high chair . " Look at him , Bernard , " Elizabeth called excitedly . Bernard , dull and sleepy , gazed up from his coffee . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved you by giving us such a fright last night , you precious little trickster , were n't you ? " she said.  |p263She  went to the high chair and kissed the baby 's head . " Bernard , you poor boy , go on back to bed and get somerest . You did n't get any sleep last night , " Elizabeth said . Mrs. Whelan came into the kitchen . As she started to greetthem , the telephone rang and she tightened up with fear . " God , your father must have another case . " " Mother , " Mr. Whelan called from the bathroom . " Mother , answer that  --  I 'm shaving . " " I 'll get it , " Elizabeth said , rushing out of the kitchen . Baby Philip laughed again and looked around happily . " Bernard , " Elizabeth called , hearing the key in the front door . She went to meet him , kissed him . He was unresponsive . " Bernard , what did he say ? Tell me , what did Dr. Sheehan say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , and it 's spreading , " he said bitterly . " It 's hopeless . "  |p267THE  Party here in New York put on a big effort for this meeting , " Tom Lyons proudly told Bernard . " I can see they 've done a swell job . " They looked around the hotel ballroom decorated with bannersand red flags . Bernard read the slogans on two signs hung over the platform up front : SOCIALISM IN OUR TIMEHAIL THE HEROIC AUSTRIAN SCHUTZBUNDFIGHTERS " We going to have a big crowd , " Tom said . " Look at them pouring in . " Bernard was glad he 'd come with Tom . He 'd never attendeda Socialist meeting before , and it would be interesting to see what it would be like . Looking around , he tried to observein what ways the people were different from those at a Communist meeting . At first there did n't appear to be any difference , but then he thought he sensed that the audience was less suspicious and hostile . Maybe he only felt these peoplewere friendlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was because the Socialists were reformists and the Communists were revolutionaries . But this did n't seem to make much sense . Still , why were the Communists unfriendly to outsiders ? In appearance , though , the people looked no different from those he 'd seen at Communist meetings . Well dressed and poorly dressed , youths , old people , foreigners , Slavic and Semitic faces , blond heads , young girl ushers with red arm bands , some homely and some good-looking.  | " I wonder how many dentists are here ? " Bernard asked . " Is that another one of your bum jokes ? " Tom replied . " Yes , that was pretty bad , " Bernard admitted sheepishly . " Bernie , I 've been telling you for years you have no sense ofhumor . " Glancing around , Bernard 's attention was attracted to a large picture of Eugene V. Debs . " Debs was a noble man , " Bernard exclaimed . " At Communistmeetings , you see a picture of Lenin instead . Debs ' face is different ; you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , there 's great intensity , and he looks Oriental . " " What 's that you were saying , Bernie ? Pardon me for not listening , I was looking around . After all , I 'm a visiting yokel from Chicago here on a vacation . " " I was talking about Debs and Lenin . " " Debs was a great man . Whenever I read his speeches , I 'm always deeply moved , " Tom said . " But he lost , and Lenin did n't , " Bernard said . " What did Lenin win ? " " A revolution that 's begun to change the face of the world . " " And look at the kind of Party he left . Yes , Lenin andTrotsky won . But look where Trotsky is  --  Turkey , is n't it ? " " No , he 's in France , " Bernard corrected . " Always a stickler for facts , are n't you ? " Bernard was looking at the picture of Debs again . Debs was dead . Debs and Lenin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The meeting tonight was honoring Socialists who 'd fought and lost . Would these people here tonight fight ? The Communists would , would n't they ? " Debs denounced the Bolsheviks , " Tom said . " He hailed them , too . " " But then he denounced their methods . " " That 's true . But , Tom , the difference between victory and defeat is the difference between life and death . " " What are you , Bernie  --  a Realpolitiker or an artist ? " " If I were in politics , I 'd be a Realpolitiker , if that 's whatp269you mean . I 've always admired the Jacobins . When I think about these questions , I sometimes wonder if I 'm just a Jacobinat heart . " " I remember once when you were drunk all you did was talk about St. Just . You were studying the French Revolutionthen . " " It is n't that I admire power , " Bernard said thoughtfully , " it 's . . . it 's rather that I do n't believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was noisy , incessanttalk . Some of the audience were moving about , talking , greeting friends . Others sat waiting . The atmosphere was one of excitement , exhilaration . " You do n't like meetings , Bernie , do you ? I love ' em . And this is going to be a good one . " " It 's a sad occasion  --  Dollfuss won in Vienna . " " He won because of Hitler , and your friends helped Hitler . " " My friends ? " " The Commies . " " What do you mean ? " " Their United Front policy from below and their crap about Social Fascism paved the way for Hitler . The German Commies voted with the Nazis and had a United Front with them in the Berlin transport strike . You know , this is a Social Fascist meeting . Look at all these people here  --  do they look like decent people ? Are any of them  --  workers ? No , they 're just dirty Social Fascists to your Commie friends . Bernie , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard thought for a moment about what Tom had just said . He 'd read enough about Germany and the rise of Hitler to know that Tom was basically right . He hesitated for another moment and then said : " They say the German Communist Party is growing . Yes , it 's growing in concentration camps , but that does n't bother Mr. Stalin . He would n't give a damn if the entire American Communist Party were put in a concentration camp if he could make political capital of it . Tom , I hate intolerance.  |p270Still  , how are you going to win ? Debs did n't win . The SocialistParty has declined since his day . " " Bernie , you just keep on writing your books . " " Say , I 'll be damned ! " Bernard exclaimed . " What ? " " There are two YCLers  --  Herman and Henry . They 're twins . I got arrested with one of them , " Bernard said , pointing to the twins . " What the hell are they doing here ? In Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings . " " How do you know they 're here to be disruptive ? " Bernard asked , although he realized instantly that the twins must have come to this meeting for that reason . " They would n't be here to contribute money or cheer NormanThomas .

" Bernard wanted to refute this , but he knew he could n't with any real conviction . " The Communists are here , " a man behind Bernard said excitedly.  |p271There  was a tenseness in the hall now , and the audience was restless . Bernard became tense , too , because of the sudden electrificationof the atmosphere . He looked in the direction of Larry Watkins . Watkins was sitting quietly , and his face seemed cold , immobile , impassive , and cruel . A cheer went up . A group entered from the rear . Watkins took his time getting to his feet . There was an ugly sneer on his face . The six young Schutzbund fighters from Vienna looked almost bewildered as they sat together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored guests . The chairman was dark and pudgy , with an open , friendly face and a genial smile . " Friends and Comrades , " he said in a pleasing voice , This meeting is a big and important event for us Socialists . We are honoring Socialist fighters who defended their liberties and their banners against the police and the Heimwehr . . . . " There was some laughter because of his throaty pronunciationof the word Heimwehr . " Yes , friends and comrades , we 're paying honor at this meeting to our dead , our Socialist comrades who fought and died defending their homes , the homes of workers and their wives and children in the Karl Marx apartments in Vienna . They fought and died defending democracy . We come here with feelings of profound solidarity and with deep admiration for what they did . " Personally , I want to say that this meeting , and the honor conferred on me by my comrades in appointing me chairman , means more to me than I can express . I 've been a Socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look  --  and I want to say that acting as your chairman tonight is one of the high moments , one of the moments I feel most deeply , in my whole career as a Socialist . . . . " " Social Fascists ! Social Fascists ! Social Fascists ! " a bald/headed man near Bernard kept repeating half aloud , almost in a tone of incantation . " Tell that loogin to shut up , " Tom said to Bernard . Someone nudged the bald-headed man . " I do n't pay attention to Social Fascists , " the bald-headed man answered insultingly . " And , " the speaker went on with feeling and conviction , " tonight we are giving voice to our feelings of international solidarity in a world of strife and growing violence and brutal  --  " There was a shuffling of feet in many parts of the hall . It grew so loud that the speaker could no longer be heard . And when the scraping took on a regular rhythm , it sounded menacing . " I 'm asking for order and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Larry Watkins rose and shouted : " Mr. Chairman , I ask for the floor on a point of order . " " Sit down  --  you 're out of order , " someone called . " Get out of the meeting , " someone else called . " Throw him out ! " Tom Lyons called out . The bald-headed man turned a murderous look on Tom . A tall , dignified Negro with graying hair stood at the rostrum . The audience was dramatically silent . He spoke slowly and with intense passion . You know who I am . I am Samuel Bowers , chairman of the Negro Labor Committee supporting this meeting . I am also a trade union leader . But to you Communists who are here disrupting this meeting I am a Social-Fascist betrayer of my people and of the working class . " There were loud cheers . The several hundred Communists at the meeting remained silent . " I 'll tell you Communists what you are . You are filthy pigs without one shred of humanity . "  |p273Cheers  . Silence from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my people . You are no friend of the black man or the white man . You are the cancer of the working class . You are the architects of defeat . If they follow your leadership , they will become tools and slaves . Your methods are as bad , are worse , than the methods of the Nazi gangsters . " More cheers . Again silence from the Communists . " You 've come here and packed this meeting with a prearrangedplan . You were spread in cadres over the hall . Each one of your cadres has a group leader . When he signals you to boo , you boo . When he tells you to scrape your feet , you obey . You 're using every dirty trick in the book to break up this meeting . Why ? Because your Russian masters have given you orders . You are executing their dirty assignments because you are the reactionary enemies of Socialism , of democracy , of decency . Your policy is rule or ruin . And if you rule , there will be ruin . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in this audience  --  beware of these Communists ! They will deceive you . They will betray you . The Negroes they have in their leadershipare the Uncle Toms of the Kremlin . They are revealing all of their methods here tonight . This is what they will be like if they ever have power . This is what they are like in Russia . Now I want to speak to you Communists directly . Why do n't you boo me ? Why are your leaders telling you to keep your feet still ? Why are you silent ? You 're black chauvinists . You let me speak because my skin is black , and you make the false claim to be the friends of my people . I dare you to boo me . He paused and then said : " You are still silent . Like all gangsters , you are moral and political cowards . "  |p274A  small , mild-looking man with white hair stood on the rostrum trying to speak . " I demand to be heard by the workers , " Larry Watkins shouted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We want Comrade Watkins ! " " We want Comrade Watkins ! " " We want Comrade Watkins ! " Then there was a steady monotonous stamping of feet . " We want Comrade Watkins ! " " We want Comrade Watkins ! " " We want Comrade Watkins ! " There was clamor and confusion throughout the hall . The chairman vainly beat his gavel on the podium . The ushers moved about trying to restore order , but the disrupters were too separated . Larry Watkins left his seat and marched along the aisle . A roaring cheer went up . Two ushers stepped in front of him to restrain him . They were rudely brushed aside by three huskies who appeared as if from nowhere and who , shoving aside the other ushers , opened the way to the platform for Larry Watkins . Fights broke out in several parts of the hall . The bald-headed man near Bernard and Tom stood up and cried out : " We want representation ! " " We want representation ! " " We want representation ! " Bernard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he 'd been deeply movedp275and impressed by Bowers ' speech . Every word was the truth . He knew now that he could never support the Communists , and it was with difficulty that Tom had restrained him from pitching in and fighting . Larry Watkins , surrounded by a rough crew , stood under the platform . " I demand the right to address the workers at this meeting , " he proclaimed in a loud , cold , sanctimonious tone of voice . " Who the hell are you ? " the chairman asked . " As a representative of the Communist Party , I demand the right of bringing the truth to the workers . " Larry Watkins started to climb the platform . A husky fellowshoved him off . One of the Communists with Watkins flung a chair at those on the platform . Someone on the platformthrew a chair that landed on someone behind Watkins . Nearly everyone in the hall was standing and shouting . A menacing , hideous , almost animal-like roar came from the gallery . The meeting had turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Watkins was hit on the head with a chair . He fell backward . Several Communistsleaped upon the platform and exchanged blows with the Socialists . Above the cries and shouts the wild , mad voice of a woman rose : " Noske ! Noske ! Murder of the revolutionary German working class ! " " Why do n't you shut up ? " Tom called to the bald-headed man who had been bellowing denunciations through cupped hands . Beside him , a young man in a khaki shirt shoved a woman in the face and catapulted her over a chair . The bald-headed man turned toward Tom : " Agents of Dollfuss ! "  | " Shut up , you Red baboon ! " Tom said . " The Socialist fakers wo n't let us speak ! " " You ought to be ashamed of yourself  --  you 're acting like a Nazi . " " Faker , Social-Fascist faker ! " " Shut up , you baboon ! " The bald-headed man lurched at Tom . Bernard grabbed the man , and as he caught him , Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yelling : " Shame ! Shame ! " Bernard saw the twins , about thirty yards away , slugging a young Socialist usher . Several men intervened and separated them . Pushed back , the twins joined in the general shouting . " It would n't happen if you 'd defend the interest of the workers the way we do , " a woman was saying passionately . Bernard turned around . The woman was humpbacked and wild-eyed . Gesturing continuously , she went on : " Our comradesare defending themselves . " " You 're a disgrace  --  a disgrace to the name of Socialism , " an old man said , sitting wearily in his chair . " The cops ! " someone yelled . The bald-headed man sat down and folded his arms . He gazed innocently about him . There was a frantic rush for the exits . " The sonsofbitches wrecked the meeting , " Tom said bitterly . " What the hell did they want to accomplish with this hooliganism ? " Bernard asked .

Shufflingsome papers and smiling weakly , he said : " Fellow writers , this is our first membership meeting of the New York Chapter of the Association of American Writers . Welcome , fellow writers . " During the summer your Executive Committee held regularmeetings and laid the groundwork for our future activities . We 've come up with a number of ideas for action . Some of them relate to our own field as writers , while others are concerned with the broader struggle of our age against war and Fascism . We 're going to have an active organization . We already have four hundred writers on our list , and we 've really hardly begun to organize . The organization of writers in America is a virgin field . " " And we 'll plow it , " Paul Drummond called out . Most of the audience burst into laughter . " Yes , " Moses said , grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , glancing at them and then setting them down on the table beside him . " We 're far behind our colleagues in Europe in organizing as writers , in getting together to make our weight felt . Every writer in the Soviet Union is organized . In Germany , before Hitler , the German writers were powerfully organized . "  --  That did n't stop Fascism , Bernard thought . " We 're going to change all this . We 've made a beginning . Most of you were at our Congress last April , when our Asso/ciation was founded , and you know what a thrilling , inspiring , historic event it was . . . . " They were discussing the Left Wing Book Club the Associationhad set up and for which Moses said they already had five hundred subscriptions . A surly , chunky fellow with unusuallyheavy black eyebrows rose and asked if any books by nonmembers of the Association would be taken as Left Wing Book Club selections . The question seemed to embarrass Moses . Bernard grinned , enjoying Moses ' discomfort . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that the Club would n't select only books written by members of the Association , and explained that although the Association , through its Executive Committee , had set up the Book Club , the Club had its own board and judges and was a completely separate organization . " One of our basic purposes , " Moses declared , " is to set up a self-sustaining , left-wing cultural apparatus . Bourgeois cultureis our enemy . It has its own apparatus of book clubs and editors and critics . We 've now made a promising beginning , and we 'll build our own apparatus . We 've founded our own book club , and we 're going to initiate a magazine and organize a lecture series . We 'll have chapters all over America , in every cultural center . We 'll have a sort of network . We have critics and book reviewers in the Association , and they are better , more fully equipped to discuss and judge books than the paid hirelings who review books for bourgeois publications . The day is not far off when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bernard looked around the room and thought :  --  The cultural Jacobins of the twentieth century . But why did he monkey with this crowd ? Was it fear of being alone ? No , it was n't that . Was it fear that he might not have courage ? No , he would n't allowp279himself to be cowardly . Would these writers be afraid if the Revolution came ? Would they face guns and use them ? " The model of what we want to achieve is the cultural organizationas it is to be seen in the Soviet Union , and , to a lesser extent , the organization of left-wing and proletarian culture in pre-Hitler Germany , " Moses went on . Alice Robertson came into the hall , but she did n't see him . He became instantly excited and frightened . Now she saw him . He wanted to signal her to come sit next to him , but he did n't because it might cause gossip . She smiled at him warmly and sat on the opposite side of the hall . He kept glancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable than ever . " Now , to come to the question of the magazine we plan to found , " Moses said . " I have something more important to say than all this talk , " Paul Drummond said angrily , as he interrupted a pointless discussionabout the proposed magazine . " Paul , " Moses answered , " I know you always have pertinentand suggestive remarks and observations to make , and I think we are always only too glad to listen to what you have to say on any subject , but I 've been following the agenda and  --  " " In a world in flames , in a world of concentration camps , on the brink of war , we talk about what ? What name we will give to a magazine , " Paul Drummond interrupted , his voice still angry . " I can understand your ardent impatience , Paul , but I do n't think we 're at odds here . We 're no ivory-tower group of writers . The age of the ivory tower is over , and we know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sometimes in order to achieve the big things we 've got to . . . we ca n't overlook the little things . " Moses was silent for a minute and seemed to be floundering for something else to say . Then he addedp280weakly , " And I know , Paul , with you around , we will have a watchful eye and a watchful intelligence to keep us from getting bogged down too much in those little things . " " Thank you , Mose , I did n't mean anything personal . But I 've got something important to get off my chest . " " Well , I 'll appoint a committee to study the question of a name for the magazine . I think we 've reached a point in our meeting where you ought to be heard . . . . I did n't want to talk too much , but I was delegated to give you a report of our plans and program , and if I 've talked too long , you can blame Sherman Scott and the other members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " You 're doing a swell job , Mose , " Sherman Scott drawled out genially . " Thank you , Scott . And now , Paul , fire away , "  --  Moses became almost acutely self-conscious  --  " and let the chips fall where they will . " " Fellows , " Paul Drummond began in his rather loud and somewhat rasping voice . " We 're all writers here , and it 's a damned good thing we 've got this new organization of ours . It 's an organization that 's close to my own heart . Along with Jake over there and Mark Singer . . . " Paul Drummond gazed about the hall . " I do n't see Mark here tonight . " " Mark  --  but pardon me , Paul , may I just take a few secondsto . . . " " By all means , Moses . " " Mark asked me to say  --  he dropped in to the offices today  --  heasked me to say he 's sorry he is n't here . But he 's dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel . " Bernard laughed aloud , and a number of them looked at him disapprovingly . " That 's good news , " Sherman Scott said in a dubious tone . " Mark and Jake and I pioneered in getting writers together , and Jake over there can tell you , or Mark could , more el/oquently than either Jake or I if he were here , how we used to talk in the twenties of how , if we could only get writers together , if we could only pull that scissors ' bill ivory-tower attitude out of their minds . . . and now it 's happened , just as we knew it would happen , " Paul continued . Jake smiled across the hall at Paul Drummond in camaraderieand gratification . " But this organization is only the political side of the coin . " Paul Drummond paused a moment . Then , quickly correcting his mistake , " Of course , it 's also literary and cultural . But we know that all culture is political . Years ago Mark Singer said that a sonnet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depression and the crisis , even our ivory-tower poets have n't turned up their noses at a scrambled egg  --  some of them would take a scrambled egg now and then even if it were a partly rotten egg . There have been times when some of our poets and **34;6337;TOOLONG boys have enjoyed rotten eggs more than they have their own rotten sonnets and their rotten estheticism . " Almost everyone seemed to enjoy Paul Drummond 's sarcasm . " Now , I want to talk plainly about something plain . The belly . That 's economics . Economics is the belly . And even writers have bellies . But most of them do n't have an economic organization , a trade union  --  just a minute , Moses , let me finish , I know what you 're going to say  --  that this organization of ours here is n't a trade union , and I 'm not trying to make it into one . But the Society of American Authors is an economic organization  --  it 's the trade union of writers  --  and we do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused . " How many of you people are members ? " He gazed around . Not one hand was raised . " That 's my point . If we were mill hands in a factory , would we be such high and almighty individualists ? Well , we have our own trade union , and we do n't join it . Maybe some of youp282will say it 's a no-good union . Well , if it is , it 's our fault . With our experience , our political savvy , why , if we all join the Society of American Authors , if every member of our Associationjoins  --  think of it  --  think of what a powerful bloc we 'll have ! " Paul Drummond paused to let his point sink in . " We could have such a powerful caucus . . . " He clenched his fists tightly . His lips were pressed together , and he leaned forward , his expression intense , concentrated , fanatical . " If enough of us go in , we can make the Society of American Authors into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two arms . " He became more relaxed and continued : " I 've just come back from Hollywood . Do n't think that screen writers are satisfied with swimming pools . They want to be organized , too , and organized on economic lines . And I want to say here that if we go into the Society of American Authors we can reach them on the Coast . And that 's something  --  something that will be big and important in the coming period . " " Paul , your suggestion is well made . I 'm joining tomorrow , " someone said . Others called out that they would join , too . " Now , is there anything more to add to what you said , Paul ? " " No , it 's not talk I want but action . Joining , working in harmony as a group in the Society of American Authors  --  that 's action . If we do n't take it , we 're suckers . It 's a plum to be picked . I say let 's pick it before some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic applause . Her smile was tender , and she seemed wistful and almost pathetic . And . . . yes , shy . It was n't easy to believe it , andp283yet she did seem shy . Eva had been shy . Her shyness had touched him . It had been one of the reasons he 'd loved her.  --  Could I love Alice Robertson ? he asked himself . Moses was talking about organization now . He and Paul Drummond and some of the others here spoke as if they really meant to capture control of American culture . He laughed to himself ironically . But that meeting last night was nothing to laugh at or to take lightly . He 'd been troubled and angry about it all day . He wanted to do something , to speak out . And then , that issue of Mass Action a couple of weeks ago with his story in it . He 'd been ashamed of himself when he saw his name and his story  --  it was neither political nor proletarian  --  and then in the same issue he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let his name be associated with the Party , if he let them use him , was n't he responsible for supporting what they did ? And they really engaged in acts of intellectual and political thuggery . Alice looked bored now . He was staying to the end of this dull , dragging meeting only because she was here . Was she staying only because of him ? But Elizabeth at home ? She 'd kissed him good-by and hoped he 'd have a good time at the meeting . Why could n't he love Elizabeth and still care for Alice ? But that was n't possible , and he knew it . What was Sherman Scott talking about ? The proposed lectureseries ? Would they ask him to speak ? If they did , should he accept ? Don Jones sat down beside him . " Hello , Bernie . " " Hello , Don . Did you have a good summer ? " " Yes  --  but it was rough work  --  there 's no rest for the weary revolutionist . But I wanted to give you these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . " Don became obviouslyembarrassed . " I do n't agree with them  --  they 're extreme , but let 's talk about them sometime . " " There 's something else I want to talk to you about , too , "  |p284Bernard  whispered , deciding he 'd tell Don what he thought about the breaking-up of the Socialist meeting last night . " I 've got to run  --  I have n't had a minute all day  --  here 're the letters . " Bernard took the small packet and shoved it into his pocket . " Ring me at the office , Bernie , " Don said , getting up and leaving . Moses turned back to the table , picked up a newspaper clipping , and said : " It 's been a long meeting , but we 've achieved a lot . Now , fellows , there 's one little item here I want to call to your attention , and it will only take a minute or so . . . . Well , last night , at a meeting , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert and listening with interest . " In an age of war , revolution , and capitalist decay , I suppose there 's no longer anything particularly surprising about another riot . But this one occurred at a Socialist meeting . A number of those in the audience , including women , were assaulted , beaten up . Several were hospitalized , and Larry Watkins , editor of The Fist , was hit over the head with a chair , and I saw him today . His head is bandaged . Now . . . " There were angry exclamations . " Now , here 's a clipping from The Fist about this outrageous , hooligan conduct of Socialists . " Moses grinned . " I read , quote , Socialists Break Up Their Own Meeting ! ' " The phrasing of the heading caused some amusement . " Mr. Chairman , I want to say something , " Bernard said urgently as he rose . " Just a minute , please , Bernard , and let me finish , " Moses said . " But I know something about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bernard sat down . He waited , tense.  | " Today we sent a protest to the Socialist Party in the name of the Association and released it to the press , too . Now some of those beaten up were Communists . We 're not a Communist organization , we 're a united front organization , and primarily we are writers , not politicians , but we discussed this among ourselves and  --  " Bernard was on his feet again . Moses looked at him uneasily . " Sit down , Carr , you have n't got the floor , " a writer named Abe Selig called out . Bernard swung around , glared , and sat down . He was shocked and indignant , but a cautioning voice warned him to avoid trouble . He did n't have to talk . And if he did , he 'd meet the hostility of almost everyone at the meeting . Moses continued : " We are an anti-Fascist organization , and we are , and I say this proudly , to be listed among those who are fighting to halt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its anti-Fascist forces is properly our concern because Fascism is the enemy of culture . Well , here is the telegram we sent . It 's to Norman Thomas . I 'll read it . The Association of American Writers deplores the antidemocraticconduct of Socialist Party members and officials at last night 's meeting at the Hotel Diplomat . Beating antiFascists , calling the police to jail them , refusing to give them a voice and fair hearing at the anti-Fascist meeting is all deplorable . We urge you solemnly to join us in public denunciationof all those responsible for this Hitler-like conduct . " Moses casually dropped the clipping and copy of the telegramon the table . " All the members of the Executive Committee signed that . " " That 's rank , " Bernard called out , again springing to his feet . " Please , Bernard , let me finish . Then if there 's time for discussionyou can talk . " " Now , I heard today that a group of writers , spearheadedp286by the Trotskyites , is getting up a petition , denouncing not those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious glance at Bernard . . . " responsible for this outrage , but the victims of it . This is going to be circulated among intellectuals for their signatures , and we must combat this petition because it is patently a Fascist document . " Moses looked about at the audience , but he avoided Bernard 's glare . His face became impassive , almost masklike . " I want to know if the membership here approves our telegram , and also if it will instruct us to do what we can to get the facts to the public and to oppose this dangerous petition of the Trotskyites . " " I want the floor now , " Bernard demanded . " I move , " Abe yelled , rising , " we endorse the telegram and we instruct the Executive Committee to do as the Chairman proposes . Nearly everyone voiced this assent . " I 'm going to talk , " Bernard said determinedly . " I wo n't listen , " Abe called out . " I was at the meeting . Everything Moses said is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and martyrlike look on his face . " The Communist Party , acting like a bunch of Nazis , broke up the meeting and  --  " " You 're out of order , Carr , " Abe yelled . " Fellows , do n't interrupt . " " Mr. Chairman , " Sherman Scott called out . " Yes , Scott . " " It 's too late for a row . I know I 'm sleepy , and I 'm not the only fellow here who is . Much as I 'd like to be present at a good old-fashioned row and  --  " Sherman Scott turned to Bernard and grinned genially , "  --  and there 's no one I 'd like to hear rowing more than Bernard , because he 's at his best when he 's angry  --  but we 've transacted a lot of business tonight , and it 's late . I think we ought to hold this over and thrash it outp287with the Executive Committee . It 's really not important enough to have a fight over at midnight . " Sherman Scott sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a voice called out . " Adjourned , " came a boom of voices . " But  --  " Bernard began . Moses looked at Bernard sweetly , innocently , inoffensively , as most of those in the audience got up and began moving to the door . Bernard stood by his chair , flabbergasted , bewildered , and speechlessly impotent with rage . " Bernie , old man , I could n't control the meeting  --  they did n't want a debate at this time of night , " Moses said . " You sidetracked me because I wanted to tell the truth , " Bernard said sharply . " Come , come , old man . . . " Moses said . Sherman Scott put his arm around Bernard 's shoulder , smiled at him , and said in a genial drawl : " Bernie , you do n't want to be so worked up at midnight . " " Carr , your action tonight made me think of the Russian S. R. 's , " Jake said , speaking rapidly and enthusiastically . " The S. R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do you know what happened ? " " Yes , the bombs  --  " Bernard cut in . " The bombs exploded in their own hands , " Jake said , bursting with laughter . Moses , Scott , and the others in the small group by the table all laughed . " Do n't you want the truth ? " Bernard asked . " Bernard , where 's your sense of humor ? " Scott asked him . " He used to have a wonderful sense of humor , Scott . Why , his sense of humor helped make the Writers Congress a successfor me , " Jake said . " I 've become a country boy . I 've got to get back to myp288hotel and hit the hay . Since I moved to the country , I have n't been burning midnight oil , " Sherman Scott said , yawning . " Bernie , " Moses said , " why do n't we sit down and thrash this out when we 're all more awake ? I 've had a long day , and I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can show you where you were wrong , and you 've just overexcited yourself . " " You know what Lenin said ? " Jake cut in . " Yes  --  freedom is a bourgeois illusion . Lenin is dead , and he never was in America , and I do n't need Lenin 's ghost to tell me from a mausoleum anything about freedom in America , " Bernard answered heatedly . " Lenin said , " Jake went on , " that if you go into politics , you 've got to , get your-hands dirty . " " Bernie , you know as well as I that the Socialists do n't do anything . They have n't got the answer , the way out . And they ca n't do anything for the creative writer , either , " Moses said . " Fellows , I 'm falling asleep on my feet , " Scott said . " I am too , Bernie . Call me up . We 'll have a heart-to-heart talk about this when my mind is in functioning order , " Moses said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bernard , " Sherman Scott added . " There are a few ideas I 'd like to talk over with you . " Moses and Sherman Scott extended their hands . Bernard reluctantly shook hands with them . " Bernie , you do n't understand politics , " Jake said . " Explain them to me . You can start right now . " " I 'd love to , but I 've got to get home now . I 'll call you up . " Jake shook hands with Bernard , too . Bernard left and , walking slowly down the stairs , realized that he 'd been outwitted and outmaneuvered . Bernard was surprised to find Alice Robertson waiting for him in front of a darkened store window near the buildingp289in which the meeting had been held . In his anger and excitementhe 'd totally forgotten her . " Hello , honey boy , " she said . " Hello . " He did n't know what else to say . " Are n't you going to kiss me , Bernard ? " He leaned forward and kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's on the street  --  and some of the local boys might see us . " I have no use for them . " " Neither have I. " They stood facing each other for a few seconds . Bernard did n't know what to do . " Let 's have a drink . " " All right , " he said , but he did n't really want to go with her . As they moved off toward Fifth Avenue , she took his arm . " Tell me you 're glad to see me , " she said . " I am . " " I 'm glad to see you . I missed you  --  I longed for you all summer . " VIIIThey were at a table at the Brevoort . Four men were sitting at the bar , talking casually . " You do n't care for me , my angel ? " " You know that 's not true . " " Do you still love Elizabeth ? " " Elizabeth is really a very sweet girl , " he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I love her , " he quickly added . He lit a cigarette just to be doing something , and he sipped his Old Fashioned . She seemed to grow beautiful before his eyes . He did n't see her face clearly now , and it was almost as though he were seeing her in a dream . Alice took his hand and squeezed it.  |  --  She is beautiful , he thought . " I admired you tonight , too , Bernard . I kept looking at you , but you never noticed it . I wanted to get up and speak for you. , , " Why did n't you ? " " Oh , it was politics . You 're an artist , Bernard . I could havecried , too , to see you getting yourself messed up in politics . " " I saw what they did at the Socialist meeting , Alice . " " I like you to call me Alice , even though I do n't especiallylike my name . " " I 'm going to fight them . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , suddenlybecoming apprehensive . " Why ? " " You 're an artist , and the artist is alone . " " Who the hell are they  --  a bunch of goddamned mediocrities . Moses is a combination of Eddie Guest with left-wing phrases and a fake Jesus Christ . Sherman is a slow-witted writer who ought to be a fisherman . And Jake is a chameleon . Who the hell are they to fight ? " " Bernard , you 're too good to be wasting your time fighting them . " He looked at his wrist watch . " Do you have to go home ? " " I think so . " " And will I see you again ? " " Of course I 'll see you . " " When ? I want us to be friends  --  at least that , honey boy . " " We are . " His emotions were confused . He wanted to get away from her . " I 'm living here at the Brevoort now . " " I 'll phone you , Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked softly . He nodded.  | " Go on home and get a good rest and buzz me soon . Let 's be friends . " She squeezed his hand again . " And take my advice , precious lamb  --  do n't you go messing in a political fight with nonentities like Moses and those others . " " I 'll think about it , " he said , motioning to the waiter.  |p292I  'M GLAD , Bernie , I honestly am , to hear you 've been makingso much progress with your new novel , " Sam Leventhalsaid , speaking so quietly that Bernard was just able to hear him . Bernard suspected the Party had sent Sam to visit him . " I 've been meaning to see you ever since you got back , " Sam said , avoiding Bernard 's eyes and speaking as if he were worried . " But I have n't had a chance to come sooner . . . and since I was passing by , I thought I 'd just ring your bell  --  I 'm not keeping you from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad to see you . How 's your writing coming along ? " " I did n't get much poetry written this summer . I feel low and disappointed about it . " " What did you think of Moses ' poem in Mass Action  --  ' I am Impatient for the Future ' ? " " What do you think of it , Bernie ? " " It 's drivel . " " I did n't like it , either , but it was hailed in the Movement as a great proletarian poem . Mark told Moses he would become the proletarian Whitman . Mass Action turned down three poems I sent them this summer . I 'm not a big shot , and I 'm not one of their clique . " " Sam  --  do you really want to be a writer ? " " You know I do , Bernie , " Sam answered rather lifelessly . " What does the Movement and the Party do to help you as a young poet ? " " Bernie , as a poet , I 'm inconceivable without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at that meeting ? " " What meeting , Bernie ? " Bernard was certain Sam knew he meant the Socialist meeting . " You wrote the account of the Socialist meeting in The Fist . " " Bernie , I never knew you cared for the Socialists . They have no influence in the cultural field  --  they do n't influence even one important younger writer or critic . " " Sam , why did you write that piece ? Not one word of it is true . Suppose I should write a novel about the Party and every word of it were a lie ? How would you  --  " " Bernie  --  you could n't do that , " Sam interrupted agitatedly . " I was at the waterfront and I could n't get back in time for the Socialist meeting . I also did a story about the big demonstration at the Bremen . Bernie , it was one of the most thrilling experiences of my life . " Sam became nervously excited . " It was inspiring . " " The Nazi flag was torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I saw a heroic worker climb the flagpole and heard the mass cheers , my spine tingled . We carried the struggle right to Hitler . I saw the Swastika torn off a Nazi ship by one of my own comrades . " " How many were injured ? " " The cops were brutal  --  I never saw such police brutality . And yet I was n't afraid  --  if I were cracked on the skull in such a demonstration , I would n't care . Bernie , it gave me so much encouragement , it made me so proud of the Party . And has anybody else spoken back to Hitler as we have ? I could just see those Nazis on the ship . Their sadistic faces  --  " " Were n't they workers  --  are n't seamen workers ? " " Yes  --  but the officers , and the lumpen  --  they 're Nazis . " " What 's that got to do with the story about the Socialist meeting ? " Sam 's eyes pleaded with Bernard.  | " We were shorthanded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting . " " Where did you get your facts ? " " From reliable comrades who 'd been at the meeting . The comrade who told me most had blood smeared all over his shirt . " " Sam , your comrade is a liar . " " Bernie , I hate to hear you talk that way . " " I mean it , Sam . Why did you write that story ? " " I was told to . " " Why did n't you refuse ? " " Bernie , it was an order  --  I 'm under Party discipline . " " Do you know what your story is , Sam ? It 's Red journalism gone yellow . " " Bernie , you ought n't to talk that way . Why do n't you have a discussion with Jake ? He can explain better than I can . " Sam , you ought to apologize for having written that story . And if I were in the Party and were ordered to write a story like that , I 'd get the hell out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakable language . " " Bernie , the Party is my life , " Sam said , turning pale . " It would be spiritual death for me outside the Party . " " Socialists break up their own meetings , and Communists break up their own souls , " Bernard said . Sam sat with a hurt look on his face . " Bernie  --  are you going back to the Church ? " " Why do you ask me such a meaningless question , Sam ? " " What you just said about souls . . . . " Sam broke off and paused . " Bernie , I like you as a friend and I admire you as an artist , even if we do disagree on politics . I mean it , Bernie . " Bernard said nothing . " It looks as though I 've become the most popular leftwingauthor in New York , " Bernard remarked with quiet irony.  |p295Jake  and he were sitting at a table in Jean MacGregor 's Restaurant on Eighth Street . " Carr , you 're the goddamndest , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Where I come from , those are fighting words , Jake , " Bernard countered lightly . " Yes  --  I 've been to Chicago . Do you know what 's the matter with Chicago ? " " It has a City Council instead of a Soviet ? " " Lay off , Bernie , I like you . Bernie , Chicago does n't know there 's no longer a Wild West . They think Buffalo Bill is still fighting Indians . " Jake laughed at his own joke . " Maybe your comrades would be better off playing politicalWild West there than breaking up other people 's meetingshere in New York . " " Yes , Bernie , you are a persistent sonofabitch . That 's why I like you . " " This is my popular day . Sam Leventhal rang my bell not long after breakfast . You take me to lunch . Sherman Scott phones me to write a lead-off review for New Freedom on some Irish book . Moses wants me to do a feature story on myself in Mass Action . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask for such popularity , Jake . " " I know . Listen , I 'm a straight-shooting guy , and I 'll tell you things straight , Bernie . Did n't I tell you last night I 'd get in touch with you ? Am I keeping my word ? " " Yes , why ? " " Let me be serious now . What happened last night was all wrong . " " That 's self-evident . But why did n't you speak up ? " " I 'll explain everything , Carr . Moses is a dumb sock . He 's a political dope . I told them not to give him so much influence in our organization . " Jake hit the table with his fist . " Moses is a dumb sock . "  | " You mean he did n't understand ? He 's confused ? " " He 's so confused that politically speaking he does n't know how to button his pants . " " He ca n't be confused , Jake . That 's impossible by definition , because he 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the Party ? " " To free the workers of the world from capitalist bondage and to help the colonial peoples break the chains of imperialism , and maybe with the faint if vain hope that the whiskers of the ghost of Karl Marx would somehow , by some mysteriousprocess known as history , turn him into what is familiarly known as a poet . Do you know why I read his poem , ' Impatientfor the Future , ' Jake ? " " Why ? " " Because I 'm a masochist . " Jake roared . " Moses ' wife told him he was a dreamy poet and not a man of action , and she wanted a man of action , so he joined the Party . Moses , poor dope , did n't know whether to have a nervous breakdown and write a poem about his splintered heart and Hasidim or to join the Party . " " So ? " " Do you know what Stalin said ? " " I do n't read much of Stalin . He 's a lousy writer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its uses . " Jake then became serious . " Bernie , I like you and I admire you . You 're not one of those New York literary schmucks ; you 're an artist , and you 're damned intelligent . That 's why I came to see you today . I like to kibitz and schinnoose around . It 's fun . There 're too many solemn-faced sourpusses in the Movement . That 's why I like to talk with you  --  but now I 'm serious . " Bernard waited for Jake to go on . He was n't sure of himself , and he realized that was why he 'd been wisecracking with Jake . " What do you think politics is ? "  | " A relentless and pitiless struggle for power , " Bernard grimly answered . A gleam of recognition came into Jake 's eyes . " Now we 're talking a common language . And do you know what revolution is ? " " The bitterest kind of war , the most pitiless of all political struggles for power . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sock like Moses and some of our other cracked chamber pots , Bernie . " " I have no intention of becoming the People 's Commissar of Culture in Flatbush , Brooklyn . " " Do n't hold it against me that I 'm a Brooklyn boy , Carr  --  you 're a Chicago boy . " " I still say there 's no excuse for last night  --  it was outrageousand filthy , " Bernard blurted out . " Nobody meant to hurt your feelings , Bernie . " " The hell with my feelings . That 's got nothing to do with it . " " Now let me give you the facts straight . Moses goofed them all up . The goddamned fool  --  " " That 's a new one , Jake . " " What ? " " Comrade Goddamned Fool . Even a damned fool has his uses , does n't he , Jake ? " " Yes , in politics . But let me explain . I told you Moses wanted to be a man of action . So what does the dumb sock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell it 's all about . He do n't know nuttin ' from nuttin ' about it , and he gets on the phone and sends that idiotic telegram to Pastor Norman Thomas . " " Jake , what the hell is the point of all this ? " " Did you ever hear of Aziev ? " " What 's Aziev got to do with it ? " " Aziev became a member of the Central Committee of the Russian Social Revolutionary Party . He organized terroristic attempts . "  | " Now the bombs burst again , " Bernard cracked . " He was a provocateur . Malinowsky , the leader of the Bolshevikfaction in the Czar 's Duma , was another . He even fooled Lenin  --  Lenin actually wrote Malinowsky 's speeches for him . And when Troyanovsky accused Malinowsky of being a Czarist agent , Lenin defended him . After the Revolution , when the records of the Ochrana were opened , they discovered that Troyanovsky , not Lenin , was right . Malinowsky was a police agent , a spy , an agent provocateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell , no , he 's an honest reformist clergyman . But the Party has already investigated that fray the other night  --  it was the work of agents provocateurs . The whole story will come out in tomorrow 's Fist . We 've got the confession of an agent provocateur who used to be in the Party . The Trotskyitessent him in . With the new turn of the Communist Internationalelast August at the Seventh Congress , why , we could n't break up a Socialist meeting  --  it would violate our line . " Jake spoke as though from the heart . But then Bernard asked : " Is Larry Watkins an American Aziev , Jake ? " " Hell , no . He 's one of our most courageous leaders . He was trained at the Lenin School in Moscow . " " How is it that Watkins was mixed up in sabotaging the Socialist meeting ? " " If Malinowsky could fool Lenin , could n't an agent provocateurfool Larry Watkins ? " " Jake , do you honestly expect me to believe you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand politics . " " Tell me another political fairy tale , Jake , " Bernard saidcoldly . " You know , Carr , maybe it 's best you do n't understand politics . You 're really an artist , and Marx said poets are queer birds and ought to be let alone . . . . Let 's order another drink . I 'll drink a Scotch and soda to your next book . "  | " I was sleepy last night , " Sherman Scott said , yawning . " I was all tuckered out , Bernard . " Bernard said nothing . The last time he 'd been in Sherman Scott 's office , he 'd been poor and needed books to review . He 'd gone away empty-handed . Now he required no help ; he did n't need men like Sherman Scott . " Moses was tired , too . You know , Bernard , he 's really a nice guy . And it 's not the same with him as it is with you and me . I have a good job , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Hollywood check , too . But Moses gets something like twenty-five or thirty dollars a week . He used to be greatly in demand as a book reviewer , but he 's given that up just to work for what he believes in . " Bernard still said nothing . " If he were n't so overworked he would n't have pulled that bull of his yesterday and last night . " " What bull was that ? " " I thought you knew about it , " Scott said in surprise . " Did n't Jake tell you ? " " News travels fast in New York . I just had lunch with Jake today and left him only about forty-five minutes ago . " " He happened to drop in here a few moments before you came . He has great respect for you , too , Bernard . " " I 'm glad to hear it , " Bernard said , recalling that he 'd waited downstairs at the entrance for about twenty minutes before coming to see Scott and that it was highly unlikely Jake had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that meeting was broken up by some agents provocateurs , " Sherman Scott said blandly . " It rather puts us in a hole , does n't it ? " " It is n't hard to apologize , " Bernard said . " Bernard , nobody meant to hurt your feelings  --  " " I do n't mean to me . My feelings do n't hurt easily . But to the Socialists . " p 300 " We 're going to have a meeting and thrash it out tonight . You know , Bernard , there was something about the literary life in the twenties , before your day  --  writers were n't alwaysgoing to meetings . They 're necessary , but they certainlytake up a lot of time . " Bernard waited for Scott to go on . " You 're in a good spot ; you 're not so involved and do n't have to go to so many meetings . Politics is necessary , Bernard , and that 's something we were too dumb to know back before Black Friday on Wall Street . And with your promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualification , Bernard , about what you 've written , but I 've always known you 're really a writer  --  a writer of your promise can make a great mistake if he gets too mixed up and is sucked into these left-wing political rivalries . Take my advice for what it 's worth  --  there 's bickering and jealousy , and you 'll get dizzy finding out who 's right and who 's wrong . It 's like a husband and wife when they 're breaking up . They 're both right , and they 're both all wet . Well , that 's not what I wanted to see you about , Bernard , but I thought I 'd talk to you about it because  --  well , because I like you and I think you 're a good guy . I think you 'll develop more as a writer if you do n't think so much  --  logic and politics are necessary , but they can only hurt a creative talent . " " If I have any brains , I 'm going to use them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , Bernard ? " " Of course . " " I have several Irish books here , and I was thinking you might take them home and look through them and let me know if you 'd like to do a lead piece on them for me . I 've been letting my Book Section get a bit too routine , and I want to broaden out . "  --  Am I accepting a bribe ? Bernard asked himself . " Yes , I 'll do it . It 'll help me co-ordinate my ideas on Irish literature . " " Swell , old man . I know you 'll do a first-rate piece for me . " Yp301He 'd do the piece because he was interested in Anglo-Irishliterature , but he would n't compromise about the Party . " I 'll try and do a good job on it . Let 's see the books , Sherman , " Bernard said . " I 'm glad you were sensible , Bernard , and did n't refuse to do that piece for New Freedom or have a quarrel with Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were eating alone , and Elizabeth had turned out the lights and put candles on the table . " It 's a legitimate piece of work , something that leads towardan eventual study I want to make , so I did n't see why I should n't do it . But I 've decided not to write any more for Mass Action . " " Of course , writing for them was n't of any special help to you anyway . " " Yes , it was . Barber told me the Movement sells books . But what the hell is that ? I 'll lose sales willingly rather than go along with the local boys . Honey , I did n't understand these people before  --  they 're no good . " " Bernard , but I hope they wo n't hurt you . " " Let them do their damndest , " he said scornfully . " You know , I was more worried than I let on when you picketed . I was afraid you 'd be beaten up . " " I learned from that experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Union Square years ago , when Sacco and Vanzetti were murdered . I associated it all with the Communists  --  and do you know what I heard ? I heard they collected money for Sacco and Vanzetti and used it for the Party , not for the defense of Sacco and Vanzetti . " " Would they dare do anything like that ? " " I 've known this all along . . . and I just . . . I was half and half in my attitude toward them . But they taught me a lesson cheaply , honey . I 'll just stay clear and go along with my work . " " Bernard , you always were sensible . Do n't worry aboutp302those people  --  they ca n't do you any harm if you do n't let them . " " I 'm not worried about them , " he said , surprised at her remark . " But you look so worried . " " I was just thinking . " " You did n't tell me you liked the roast beef , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Bernard ! Bernard ! " He came out of the bathroom in a paralyzing fright . " Bernard ! " She was upstairs and calling loudly with impatient excitement.  --  Jesus Christ ! The baby ! he told himself . He rushed upstairs and burst into the baby 's room . " What happened ? " he asked breathlessly and in panic . " Look at your son , Bernard . He 's standing up . He 's standing up , " she said , talking rapidly and in great excitement . Philip , in blue rompers , was standing up in his crib . Therewas an expression of wonder and bewilderment on his face , and his blue eyes were fixed on his deliriously happy mother . " You frightened me , " Bernard said , slow to react . Then an overwhelming feeling of love for his son cameover him . He was in awe at the sight of the baby , standingalone in the center of the crib . It was like witnessing a miracle . Yes , it was awesome . And it was a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the life of his son . He was thrilled . " Kiss me , Bernard . I 'm so happy . "  |p303BERNARD  was having lunch with Don Jones in an Armenian restaurant on Lexington Avenue . " I 've been wanting to talk with you about literary criticism for a long while , Bernie , but I never could find the time . Gee , I 'm glad we finally did get together . " " This shishkabob 's good , " Bernard said . " Is n't it ? You know , some Philistines think we Communistsdo n't appreciate the good things in life and have no taste in food , books , or anything . They think we 're bomb throwers instead of human beings . And that reminds me of something I 've been wanting to talk to you about for some time now . " " What ? " " The other night Mortimer and some of us were talking about literature after a meeting . We were talking about the Great American Novel , and Mortimer was explaining why the Great American Novel will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party and of its leaders . I agree with that . " " Does Mortimer mean that novels should be written to glorify Eldridge and Larry Watkins and himself ? " " Bernie , " Don said with a pained expression , " you should n't talk this way . Our leaders are the advance guard of America . And , Bernie , I have something to tell you . The other night we got to talking about our writers , and naturally we talked about you . You 're one of our writers . Do you know what we think ? " " What ? " " A trip to the Soviet Union would be good for you . If you could see the Soviet Union , Bernie , it would give you perspec/tive on America . Then you could even  --  who knows  --  you might be the one to write the Great American Novel . " " Don , I do n't need material . Someday I 'll go to Russia not to see America but to see Russia . " " If you see Eisenberg , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get invited or be a tour leader . And once you were there , you could make all your expenses by writing articles . Writers get paid well there  --  they are n't exploited the way they are in America . You remember Jan , who used to be on Mass Action ? Jan 's living well in the Soviet Union . " " Why would the Russians want me so much that they 'd practically pay me to come ? " " That 's just what I was trying to explain , Bernie . They respectwriters . The masses look up to the writer . Books are printed in editions of hundreds of thousands . That 's one of the things we have to achieve in Soviet America . Until then we can only hope , can only give guidance to our writers . " " Don , you 're a nice guy . " Bernard 's remark took Don by surprise . " You 're an awfully nice guy , Don , but you 're talking non-sense . " Bernard had dropped on his desk the letters Don Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Sitting in his study now after his lunch with Don and his walk home , he noticed them . He picked one up and read : September 15 , 1935 New York , N. Y. Dear Comrade Editor : When I was miseducated in the bourgeois schools , I was made to write , as punishment , this sentence : When I was a boy , I did the things of a boy , but now that I am a man , I must do the things of a man . " I read the story , " Campus Love , " by the bourgeois writer Carr , in your pages . It is a disgrace . What has a **25;6373;TOOLONG got to do with stories about middle-class boys gettingthe itch of love ? The revolutionary editor looks for stories written by revolutionary men for revolutionary men about revolutionary men . Do n't disgust the workers by printing any more of the bourgeois Carr 's drivel . With revolutionary greetings , Oscar C. SmithamBernard put the letter aside and picked up a second . September 16 , 1935 Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandising the instruments of death as the way out of the world capitalist crisis to head off the revolution , and you print a driveling , de f eatistic , sentimentalstory about a boy whose father gives him a kick in the pants . Do n't print any more stories by B. Carr . Yours for Proletarian Literature , Ed SmanskiHe flung aside this letter and picked up a third . September 14 , 1935 Dear Don : Chicago , IllinoisWhy do you print Carr ? He 'll never be one of us . He 's a bourgeois careerist who is using us for all the sales and praise he can get , and when he gets them , he 'll betray us . Last summerhe went around Chicago voicing ignorant anti-Soviet prejudices . . . . Bernard rapidly typed a letter to the editors of Mass Action . September 18 , 1935 Dear Sirs : New York CityOn the evening of September 6th , a meeting was held underthe auspices of the Socialist Party . Six Austrian Socialists ,  |p306members  of the Schutzbund , were being welcomed to this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupted it by stamping their feet , hooting , and catcalling . This action was neither sporadic nor accidental , but clearly planned . Among those present and participating in the disruptiveactivity was Larry Watkins , editor of The Fist , official organ of the Communist Party , U.S.A. , and a member of the Central Committee . Other known Communists were present and active in the rioting . The disrupters were strategicallyseated and grouped throughout the hall , and when the disorder began , it was unmistakable that they were organized with group leaders directing them . All appeals and efforts of the chairman to maintain order were in vain . The sole aim of the Communist action was to break up the Socialist meeting . Larry Watkins , surrounded by a bodyguard of sluggers , marched to the platform demanding to be heard . He and the Communist Party had nothing to do with this meeting . He had no right to expect to be allowed to deliver a speech at a public meeting of this kind . His conduct , and that of his comrades , was singularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany breaking up radical meetings by hooligan methods , and , having been a witness of this ruthlessdisruption by Larry Watkins and his comrades , I see no difference . This sabotage of a Socialist meeting was an aping of Nazi Fascist tactics . The Fist , edited by Larry Watkins , printed lying accounts of what happened at that meeting . The story was signed by the young poet , Samuel Leventhal , who has admitted to me he was not even present at the meeting . The Executive Committeeof the Association of American Writers , on the basis of lies about what happened , dispatched a telegram to the Socialist Party , placing the blame for this cowardly gangsterlikepolitical action on the shoulders of the Socialist Party . At a meeting of the New York chapter of this organization I was prevented by steamroller tactics from speaking aboutp307either the telegram or the Socialist meeting . The chairman was Moses Kallisch , a member of the Executive Committee of the Association of American Writers and an editor of Mass Action . Rumors are now being circulated to the effect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not believe this . But I propose that there be constituted an impartial Committee of Inquiry , composed of writers and intellectuals of accepted integrity and without radical-party or organizational affiliations , and that this Committee find out the facts and issue a report placing blame where it belongs . If the Communist version of what happened is true , they have nothing to fear . Did n't Lenin say it 's never too soon to tell the truth to the working class ? It 's never too soon to know the truth on any subject . In conclusion , I wish to say most emphatically that I considerthe conduct of the Communists in this matter inexcusablyrepugnant and shameful . Sincerely yours , Bernard Carr " Honey , I keep asking myself how can they lie and do such things ? Anyway , my letter will be a bombshell , " Bernard said , pacing the floor excitedly . " But , Bernard , if you fight with the Communists , will it take up so much of your time that it will delay your book ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it are really beautiful . " " if I did n't write that letter , I could n't look myself in the face . " Bernard paused . " Honey , I do n't want to be immodest , but I 've always tried to express the truth in my writing , and peoplewill believe me when I make charges against the Communists . And Mass Action will have to publish my letter , because some other papers will  --  I sent copies to the generalp308press and to the liberal and radical papers and magazines . There 'll be a scandal if Mass Action does n't publish it  --  it 'll show them up for what they are . " " I hope so , Bernard , " she said , remembering that earlier this year he 'd talked about his duty to picket . He was so good and honest , and she admired him for doing this , but she was afraid they might do something to harm him or his reputationor the sales of his books . They would all gang up on her Bernard . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , the Party is made up of human beings , and they can be influenced . Many of them are idealistic and self-sacrificing even though it seems to me their idealism is terribly perverted . Maybe my letter will help break up this cultural front of moral terror they 're trying to form . Because that 's what it is  --  moral terror . Why , they 've got that poor nebbuch Sam Leventhal scared out of his wits . " The doorbell rang . Bernard rose . " I wonder who 's coming to give me another dialectical song and dance , " he said . " Yes , " Lester Owens remarked approvingly as he put down the copy of Bernard 's letter . Bernard waited for him to go on . He wanted to be praised for having written this letter . Lester Owens was plump and about forty . Bernard had heard of Owens and had read some of his poems and passionatelywritten articles , but he had never met him . Owens had been formal and nervous when he 'd first come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking as though they were old friends . " I thought we 'd have to have a long discussion for me to try to persuade you , Carr . I 'm glad to find out I do n't . And I 'm damned glad to see you have more political savvy than I expected . You 're not a Party member , are you ? "  | " No , I would n't join any political party . I do n't believe a writer should . " " Good , " Lester Owens said , laughing . " Neither do I. " " I thought you were a Trotskyite . " " Hell , no . If I have to be classified , I 'm an anarchist . " He became somewhat shy . " I 'm really a poet , but I have to do a lot of hack jobs to make a living . I like your work , and I 'd like to have a long bull session with you about it some other time , but let 's get this political matter cleared up . Two Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a friendly smile . " When was your last confession ? " Bernard asked lightly . " I 'm Black Irish , " he answered proudly . " Your people took the soup in the old country , " Bernard went on . " Yes , I 'm a perennial black sheep . I won a Congressional Medal of Honor in the war to make the world safe for Lenin and democracy , and the local American Legion post in my home town back in Idaho ca n't understand why I 'm a maverickblack sheep . " Then he said : " I take it you 'll sign this letter protesting the Communist hooliganism against the Socialists . " " Yes . " " Good  --  we 'll be glad to have you . Since you 've been identifiedwith them , it will be very effective . It 's a damned good , strong letter . " " I was n't too close to the Movement , " Bernard said quickly . " Carr , you 're just getting off the same merry-go-round I got off . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is all you need . You know , one by one , every decentand talented intellectual and writer in these times seems to go through the same pattern . I guess it 's the political measles of the intelligentsia . I was on the original board of Mass Action . " " Yes , I looked through the early copies in the library . "  | " It was a good magazine then . " " What happened ? " " The Commies just moved in on us . Hell , you take a fellow like me . I 'm not only a poet , I 'm a man with a wife and family to support . I have to make a living . Serving on the editorial board of Mass Action was strictly extracurricular . But for the Commies it 's different . They spend twenty-four hours a day capturing a magazine or an organization . And then they wreck it . You ca n't work with ' em . I learned that from my own experience . We formed a committee of intellectualsto support the Commies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent organization . They packed one of our meetings and voted the organization into nonexistence . Duffy , the young novelist , did the job wrecking our committee . He was chairman the night we were voted into nonexistence . " Could n't you do something ? " " Carr , did n't you just tell me how you could n't get the floor the other night at that meeting ? " " Yes . " " It 's the same story . Well , then I joined a nonpartisan , nonStalinistdefense committee . I was chairman , " Owens laughed . " I 'm smiling because I was chairman . " " What happened there ? " " The Trotskyites decided to break up our nonpartisan nonStalinistcommittee . They were in on it , but then they amalgamatedwith another group , and their party line changed . So our committee became non-Marxist overnight , because they had a new line and did n't want a nonpartisan defense committee . Good friends of mine , fine fellows , but at this meeting they lied like troopers and in just the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride . " " I 've read Trotsky . He 's a great man and a great writer . " " Is n't he ? " Lester Owens said quickly and enthusiastically . Then , more slowly , he added , " But his boys and followers here  --  they 're almost as bad as the Commies . They aren'tp311hooligans , but they can twist and turn and put a political knife in your back , too . I do n't trust them any more than I do the Communists . But I guess others will have to learn , as I have , and as you 're starting to . Are you prepared to take it , Carr ? " " Take what ? " " The consequences of coming out against the Commies . You know , signing this letter , plus the letter you wrote , puts you off their reservation . " " What the hell do I care ? " " Good  --  you 're a black sheep now . It 's the same as going to hell . We 'll meet good friends in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalinists wo n't call you . They 'll throw everything in the book at you . " Elizabeth , who had been listening quietly , suddenly inter-rupted : " But why should they call Bernard names ? They all like him . Why , they 've come here and we 've even had them to dinner , and Bernard is only disagreeing with them . " " Mrs. Carr , " Lester said , looking at Elizabeth with an almostpaternal look . " Call me Elizabeth . " " Elizabeth  --  that 's just the kind of people they are . " " Yes . . . but tell me more of what you were going to say , Owens , " Bernard cut in . " They 'll say you beat your mother and your children . They 'll gang up on your books , and , the first thing you know , editors wo n't publish your stuff  --  I mean some editors . They 'll line up as many critics and reviewers as they can to attack your books when they 're published . They 'll stop at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it , too , but it looks to me , Carr , as if you can take it all right . " " Let ' em howl , " Bernard said with contempt . " I just do n't understand why so many writers and intellectuals are so afraid of them . "  | " I 've puzzled my brain trying to answer that question , Carr . I do n't know . " Bernard thought for a moment . " I guess they 're afraid because they do n't have faith in themselves . They do n't have faith in art , in ideas . They 're afraid to stand alone . "  |p313IT  'S pleasant having a drink here  --  especially on an afternoon like this . Autumn 's my favorite season , " Bernard said to Alice as they were sitting in the Brevoort Restaurant . It was almost deserted . The windy afternoon reminded him of Eva . He 'd loved Eva in the autumn . " Bernard , it was sweet of you to phone and see me . Why did you do it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would . " " I was feeling low today , " she said . " I was still in bed when you phoned . " Her knees touched his under the table . " I do n't know what 's the matter with me . I ca n't write at all . Maybe it 's New York . I guess I ca n't live a peaceful , normal life here in Babylon on the Hudson . It 's not Babylon to you , is it , Bernard ? " " I like New York . " " I guess I like it because I come from Ohio . " " Most of us come from some place . " She laughed . " Forgive me for laughing , honey angel , but that 's price-less . " " I know it 's a truism , but what I meant is that most of us come from , ordinary beginnings and a life very different from the way we live now . Our values , our aims , the things that excite us , the way we see things are all different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw life . Sometimes I think the difference between my life now and my life and the lifep314of my people in Chicago is like the difference between night and day . They 're two worlds far apart , and I wonder if they 're bridgeable . " " I say thank God it 's different from my childhood . I hated it . I do n't want any bridges to the life and values of my people . " " Did you have a very unhappy childhood ? " " God , yes . I was a girl , and my goddamned mother never wanted a girl . She tried to make me believe I was made of sugar and candy and all things sweet . Oh , she was crazy . And she and my aunt were always warning me against men , telling me it was like having a telephone pole hurt you . And my uncle raped me when I was twelve . He finally died a Christian death in my aunt 's arms . " " Did n't you tell your folks what he did to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother anything . I hated that old sonofabitch of an uncle of mine because he was a hypocrite . " She laughed with peculiar bitterness and contempt . " Sometimes I felt like telling my mother  --  ' Mother , it just ai n't no telephonepole . ' " Bernard tried to visualize her as a little girl . " Honey boy , I could tell you so many stories about my life  --  I 've lived a full life . " " Are you going to try to write about them ? " " I 'm writing a novel about two well-known writers . I was their mistress . I hated them both . . . . But , angel boy , there 's the waiter . Let 's have another . " Her knees pressed more firmly against him , and she gave him a soft and inviting glance . " Maybe I ought n't to tell you what he did to me . I 'm afraid it will shock you . " " Why should I be shocked ? " " He put me in a cage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me whip him . That 's why I hate him now  --  I hatep315him for it . My book will be my revenge . " She laughed hollowly . " And to think that one of his books was a best sellerand was a book club selection read dotingly by old maids and wives . " " What the hell kind of a sonofabitch is he , playing the Lady and the Tiger and thinking it was love ? " " That was the way he made love . " Bernard did n't want her to know how shocked he was . He knew such things happened and that such tendencies were buried in the nature of every person . Deep in everyone , he knew , was the impulse to hurt and be hurt . Still , to know someone to whom such a thing had actually happened was a shock . " What do you think of what I told you ? " " Human nature is sometimes that way . " " I lived with him . And he made me strip and let him whipme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you ? " " Honey child ! " " What ? " " You do n't understand me. "  --  I do n't , he silently said . " Do you like me ? " " Yes . " " Why ? " " Why should n't I like you ? " She looked at him quizzically . " I 'm an honest person . Do you know what else I did once ? I went out and walked the streets like a whore . " " Why did you do that ? " " I wanted to know what it was like . " Bernard said nothing . " I just decided one night on the spur of the moment that I 'd like to know what it was like to be a whore , " Alice said with a kind of bravado . " What was it like ? " " Not what it would be like with you . "  |p316Bernard  frowned unwittingly and defensively . " I 'm sorry , Bernard , if I 've disturbed you . " " You have n't disturbed me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I talk about things I should n't , I 'll disturb you . " " But are any subjects forbidden ? " She looked at him closely . He was bothered by her eyes . He was afraid she would see that his desire was threatening to overcome his self-control . And the feel and pressure of her knees . . . to let go and say the hell with caution , to abandonhimself with her . . . why did n't he ? He wanted to . " Let 's have another drink , " he suggested . Perhaps the drink would relieve him of his tension . " Yes , let 's . " " Well , to tell you about my night of scarlet sin . But are you really interested , Bernard ? " " Of course I am . " She smiled confidently and went on : " I went out and walked the streets just because I was curious . I wanted to know if it was any different if you picked up a strange man and sold yourself to him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked up to a man and I asked him . " " What was he like ? " " How do I know ? He was a stranger . I never saw him beforeor since . He was scared , " she went on , laughing . " He was scared . " " What did he look like ? " " I do n't remember . It was at night  --  a fall night . I went up to him and said , Do you want to go to bed ? ' He got so scared I wanted to laugh , and he did n't say a word  --  he just scooted by me and turned at the next corner . " It seemed to Bernard that her laugh was cruel . " A man afraid of a woman , a man running away from ap317good piece of tail can be the funniest thing in the world . Ca n't he , Bernard ? " " The poor guy was just afraid , " Bernard said calmly . He asked himself with concern if he were n't afraid of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to a hotel . He asked me how much I wanted , and  --  would you believe it ?  --  I did n't know what to say . I mean I was n't trying to make the money because I needed it . So I said ten dollars , and after it was all over he gave me a five-dollar tip for my performance . " She grinned with pleasure . " He told me I was the best whore he 'd ever had . He did n't say it that way , he said ' girlie '  --  but he meant whore . I did better than the professional . It only mares me wish I could outdo the professionals as a writer . But , believe me , honey child , someday I 'm going to be a writer . " Alice 's talk struck him as extreme and not genuine , but he did n't dwell on it . " It did n't mean a thing to me . I was bought . I was giving what I had contracted for . I had no will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was a machine . Only I did enjoy it . Not as I would have if it had been with a man I loved . " Her gaze was unmistakable , but he ignored it . " That 's how I became a Scarlet Sister for a night , and learned that all women are prostitutes in their hearts and want sex as much and as promiscuously as men , " she said challengingly . Bernard was unwilling to accept this , but he said nothing . " But love is n't merely an orgasm . Or do you think it is , precious ? No , you ca n't . You 're a creative person . You think love is romantic . " " I do n't know how to define love , " Bernard said . " When it 's just physical , it 's just that . It ai n't love then , if I can talk proletarian . I 'm a mystic , Bernard . " Bernard smiled at her in tolerant amusement . " You are , too , but you wo n't admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love ca n't be just an orgasm . It has to be more . It 's union , it gives you something you can never get any other way . It gives you all you are supposed to get from God . I believe in God , too . I believe God is something like a principle , a spiritual principle , and that 's what I mean . It 's like giving you part of God . It 's just not like the animals . That 's fornication . It 's fun to fornicate . I 'm a plain , honest , direct person , and I like a shorter word , but you would n't like me to talk that way because . . . because Elizabeth does n't . You 're a romantic , Bernard . " She put up her hand to stop him as he was going to say something . " Do n't tell me you are n't a romantic  --  you are . " She leaned across the table , took his hand , and gazed at him . He tried to look away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could n't talk . He was uncomfortable . " Now ? " she asked . " Yes , " he said , feeling he had no will of his own . After kissing Alice in her hotel room , Bernard tried to convince himself that he was being carried away and had no control over what he would do . But he knew better . He 'd been with Alice too long today not to want this . He kissed her eagerly , impulsively , and with a sense of desperation . He was flinging himself into an adventure , and he knew that he really wanted to . " Bernard , I want to talk with you , " she said , sitting on the bed and running her right hand through her disheveled hair . He grabbed her awkwardly to kiss her again . " Bernard , talk with me a minute . " He sat beside her on the bed , impatient , fumblingly strokingher arm and her shoulders . " Maybe I should n't do this , Bernard , " she said , as though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husky-voiced and feeling himself driven by impetuous desire.  --  It 's gone too far for me to stop , he told himself . " Maybe someone will get hurt . " " Why does anyone have to be hurt ? " " I do n't know , " she said softly , looking down at the floor . She suddenly seemed shy to him , and he wanted her all the more . " Bernard , I care for you very much . I do . But you 're sweet . And Elizabeth is a sweet girl , " she said , seeming utterly sincere . He pulled her to him . She submitted to his kiss . Then she said : " If we 're going to , honey child , let 's drink a bottle of champagnefirst . You be an angel and go out and buy one . " He looked at her suspiciously . " I 'll be ready for you , I promise . " He quickly put on the jacket of his suit coat and his topcoat and left the room , walking down rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel for a moment , dazed . This was all unexpected , unintended . It was getting dark . He ought to go home . He ran across Fifth Avenue , heedless of the traffic . In front of the drugstore he thought of going inside , phoning Alice , and telling her he 'd changed his mind . He took a step toward the entrance , drew back , and went on along Eighth Street . Alice would think he was afraid . But that did n't matter if . . . if what ? If this were wrong ?  --  Have I become a moralist ? he asked himself.  --  Nothing 's right or wrong but thinking makes it so . Suppose he should run into Elizabeth . He was apprehensive . And he was n't sure that he did n't really want to meet her . What would he tell her when he got home ? Suppose he ranp320into a mutual friend who might accidentally trip him up sometime when he was with Elizabeth ? He drew closer to the buildings and hurried on to the liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to a fling , and he was n't going to hurt Elizabeth or leave her . He 'd wanted Alice from the moment he 'd seen her , and he 'd get what he wanted . " I thought you would be naive , " Alice said , " but you were n't . " He opened his eyes a little and looked at the ceiling . " We 're good for each other , " she said . " I do n't know what 's good and bad for me . I only know how I feel  --  merely peaceful . . . as though I were in some quiet place that 's nowhere . " She bent over and kissed him . He touched her breast . " Are you sorry ? " she asked him . " Are you ? " he asked . " No , you gave me something . " " Jesus , I hope not . " " Oh  --  that . I ca n't have a baby . I had an abortion when I was seventeen . " " Do you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and with overemphasis . He was a little sorry for her . And yet . . . and yet what ? He did n't know . " You 've got nice legs and thighs , " he said , stroking her left leg and thigh . She smiled enigmatically . " Like a girl 's . " " What else should they be like ? " " They could be too thick . " Suddenly he became uneasy . " I 'll have to be going , " he said . " Ca n't you telephone Elizabeth and say you are n't coming home for dinner ? "  | " I 'd better not . " " Are you going to feel guilty and tell her ? " " No  --  what have I got to feel guilty about ? " he asked . " You are n't sorry , angel ? " " No , I 'm not . " But he knew he would feel guilty . It was dark and windy out . The weather had become raw . A few people hurried by him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1927 . Sometimes on nights like this , at this time , he 'd gone back to his room at the Y.M.C.A. He 'd been lonely for a girl , and then there had been Eva . And he 'd been lonely in Chicago on nights like this . He was lonely now , and he had a girl . Now he had a wife and a beautiful mistress , if he wanted both . He crossed over on Fifth Avenue and then went up to Ninth Street . What would he say to Elizabeth ? How would he act with her tonight ? He had n't told her he 'd be out all afternoon . A feeling of sadness came over him : this was the first time he was going home when he could n't tell the truth . Now he might even have to lie to her . The big apartment building with most of its windows lit  --  how many men living there were unfaithful to their wives ? Unfaithful . He did n't like the word . Did n't he own his own body ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was he ? Some need in him had driven him to this . He 'd always known that this would happen , and finally it had . That phrase . A girl with longer , slimmer legs . It seemed meaningless , but it had some highly significant meaning for him . Just ahead , the brownstone building . His home . Would home mean something different ? Since boyhood he had never wantedp322to return home after being out , especially on nights like this in the fall . He wanted to be going home now , only . . . Alice had been good to him today . Elizabeth . She was good to him , too . He was glad he 'd done it , and yet he wished he had n't . He came to the brownstone and , opening the gate by the steps and taking out his key ring , he feared he had come to some kind of turning point in his life . He turned the key in the lock . " I was so worried about you , Bernard . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never get hurt . " " I know it  --  I know how you like to meet people and talk , but still , I was worried . . . I just got worried . " They were eating . " Your son was a bad boy today , " she said with amusement . " What did he do ? " " Oh , he had a tantrum . He reminded me of his father when you used to get . . . well , when you used to get mad and obstreperous . You do n't so much any more . Nothing satisfied Philip . He held his food in his mouth at supper , and he cried and threw things . He was all out of sorts with the world . " " Is he all right ? " Bernard asked anxiously . " I think so . He does n't have any fever . He just had a tantrum , and his little face got so red when he screamed . It just got all screwed up and wrinkled , and he just yelled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I wonder what caused it . " " He was just mad , I guess . " " And you do n't think there 's anything wrong with him ? " " No . He just had a tantrum . " " What did you do ? " Bernard asked . " Oh , I cooed to him and played with him and sang to him , and for a while I just left him in his crib and told him to cryp323it out . I wonder if you had tantrums , Bernard , when you were his age . " " I must have . " " I guess everybody has . But I meant I 'd like to have seen you when you did . I 'll bet you were cute , twisting your face all up and not letting anybody or anything satisfy you . I 'd just love to have seen you . " Bernard nodded his head . He felt an inner strain , and he did n't want to talk . " Bernard  --  you talk so much more with other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk all afternoon about politics or books , and then sometimes you do n't say a word to me . " " That is n't true , " he answered defensively . She might ask him whom he 'd seen this afternoon , and he might trip himself up . If he got angry now he could sidetrackher from such questions . But it would n't be right to get angry with her now . " Yes it is , Bernard . " He was relieved . She was n't suspicious . But he felt guilty . If he told her , could she understand , be tolerant , accept it ? It would hurt her , of course , but could the wound heal and the truth serve as a basis for a clearer relationship between them ? Or would she be jealous , unforgiving , angry , disturbed ? He remembered back in Chicago this summer , thinking about whether or not his mother should be told the truth . Was n't this a question of truth ? He looked across the table at Elizabeth with sympathy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break off with Alice now , before their relationship grew deeper , but he knew it was useless to make such a resolution . He had broken one resolution already . He wanted Elizabeth , and he wanted Alice , too . Alice Robertson lay naked under the covers of the rumpled bed in the hotel room thinking about herself . Bernard was ap324big feather in her cap . She 'd just about given up hope of gettinghim and had almost decided she 'd take him as a friend . Now , she wondered , could he be her friend and her lover ? This afternoon she had been really shy , and she 'd felt that they should n't have an affair . She could n't have gone through it without the champagne . She had no idea why she 'd needed the champagne , but she had . She could n't quite understand it . It was difficult to believe that she 'd felt shy and like a girl , almost like an inexperienced girl , but it was true . " Oh , goddamn it ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't know why she was cursing . She ought to be happy . Was n't she , she asked herself in irony , a satisfied woman ? Why was she depressed ? And why did she want to curse and blaspheme ? God , what a life she had had . Maybe she would be able to write her autobiography some day . She looked wistfully up at the ceiling . Was she fooling herselfabout writing ? Many of her lovers had told her she was gifted . What would Bernard think of her work ? When this love affair ended , she wanted to be friends with him . She wanted to have something in common with him intellectually.  --  Something.  --  That 's all I want . All I want is something . The men she had slept with ! How many were there ? She could n't remember them all . Had she reached a hundred yet ? Some girls who were just wives , like Bernard 's Elizabeth , would spend their lives sleeping with only one man . In their hearts they envied her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all wanted to be like her . She did n't want to be like them and live their boring lives minding babies and sitting home nights while their husbands slept with someone like her . But Elizabeth was sweet , and she did n't want to break up Bernard 's marriage . Why did marriages have to break up becauseof her ? It was n't sophisticated . Why , it was Lima , Ohio . She laughed.  |p325Would  she ever go back to Lima ? She was sophisticated now , a sophisticated adventuress . With all the writers she 'd slept with , would n't she be written about ? Some day biographiesof her lovers would be written , and her name would be in these books . She looked idly about the room , trying to imagine some young girl reading of Alice Robertson . But , God , she 'd be dead then ! She did n't want to die . She did n't want to grow old . Today , in Bern - rd 's arms , she had moaned and thought to herself :  --  God , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Bernard doing ? Sitting quietly by the fireside ? With Elizabeth sewing ? If Elizabeth did n't sew , she should . Her mother used to sew and she used to tear her clothes just to keep her mother sewing . She guessed it had been mean . What was being mean ? She could remember herself in that stuffy parlor with all that heavy- furniture , watching her mother sew and laughing to herself because her mother thought she was a virgin . She became restless . What would she do with herself ? Maybe she needed a drink . She sat up and held her breasts for a moment . She looked at her toes and then at her long , slender legs . She liked men to look at her legs . Bernard had told her he liked them , and he 'd caressed them . " Jesus Christ , " she exclaimed loudly . A look of torment crossed her face . She heard the noise of the elevated outside and she was momentarily frightened .  --  I 'm getting the jitters , she thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink slip , and pink brassiere were flung on the chair . The empty champagne bottle , two glasses , and a tray full of ashes were on the small table beside the bed . This , she reflected sarcastically , was the habitat of a kept woman . She felt as though she were shaking inside . She wanted somebody to sleep with her tonight or else to get high , because she could n't bear this shaking , jittery feeling . Shep326quickly lit a cigarette and looked at her hand . She could n't see it shaking , but she felt herself to be trembling inwardly . She looked about the room again . Would she ever find the something she 'd been chasing all her life ?  |p327No  . I think I 'll work this afternoon , " Bernard said with an air of resolution and decision as he got up from the table . " Bernard , maybe if you do n't , you 'll work better tomorrow , " Elizabeth said . " You should n't give in to yourself too easily , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard , you wo n't be giving in to yourself if you do n't work for part of the day . You know you often say a writer ca n't force himself to work . " He stood by the table , indecisive . He could leave and have a rendezvous with Alice . He started to say that maybe he would knock off , but checked himself . " No , I 'll work , " he said . Up in his study , Bernard drugged his mind for about a half hour by playing solitaire . Then he put aside the cards , picked up a newspaper , and tried working on a crossword puzzle . He was bored within five minutes . He was unable to concentrate on anything or to drown his desire for Alice for long . Why ? Hell , she was a nymphomaniac , was n't she ? His feeling was one of lust . She 'd never show the solicitude for him that Elizabeth did . Elizabeth was good for him . But all this was irrelevant . He could n't take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her this afternoon . He might just as well have . Would n't it be better to wear out this lust and be done with it ? And then if Elizabeth found out , explain it to her ? She 'd understand . Or if it came to a matter of choice , then choose Elizabeth.  |  --  Am I afraid ? He went to the couch and lay down , reading . He closed the book , dropped it beside him , and shut his eyes . He visualized Alice naked . He imagined himself making love to her and his nervousness vanished . He wondered if his will and discipline were crumbling . He felt rotten and guilty . He went to the window and stood looking down at the small back yard . It was beginning to grow dark . He heard the wind and watched dead leaves drop from a small tree . He gazed at the gray , dark stones , and the black , hard dirt . The small garden seemed desolate . The day was desolate . It was the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often in his youth he 'd wanted the warmth and love and closeness of a girl on such days ! He turned from the window and went back to his desk . He tried to work , but kept tearing up what he wrote . Bernard stared drowsily at the fire , seeing small golden streaks in the large , roaring red flames , hearing the crackling of the wood , watching bits of burning wood and red ash drop off the logs , and he felt almost contented and relaxed after the futile day of conflict with himself . " Bernard , remember how we used to talk of how some day we wanted a fireplace ? " " Yes . " Could he sit with Alice at a fireplace and be quiet like this ? " And now here we are , sitting at a fireplace . Oh , it makes me feel so cozy . " The fall of 1928 . In 1928 and 1929 they 'd often walked in Jackson Park , through dead leaves . These days had been  --  been what ? Pregnant with melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green hat . Her trim figure and her round , young face . Holding her hand , walking through tan cracklingleaves , the crackling dead leaves under their feet , his own melancholy mood , his unsureness , his thoughts of the dayp329when he 'd feel justified in himself as a writer , an artist . And Elizabeth walking beside him and talking of a fireplace . He remembered once having the sudden thought that when they did have their fireplace he would n't want it . " A fire in a fireplace makes you a little sad . But it 's such a nice sadness , " she said softly . The flames were dying down a bit . There was an aura of sleepy warmth about them . He leaned forward to get up and poke the fire . " Yes ? " Elizabeth asked drowsily . " Nothing , I was going to poke the fire . " " Put your arm around me . " He did . What would happen to her if she found out ? If they broke up ? If he went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binge . The fire slowly dying down . . . dying , slowly burning into ashes . Ashes . The word had always been so charged with meaning for him . Ash Wednesday and ashes on his mother 's forehead . And the priest , droning out the Latin words of : Remember , 0 man , that thou art dust , and to dust thou shalt return . His mother was groaning and moaning with pain as she burned out like some gnarled and knotty old limb of a tree . Who would die first ? Elizabeth or he ? The wind in the chimney . The dying fire . Elizabeth purred softly and contentedly . What was Alice doing tonight ?  --  No , who is she with ? In whose bed ? he asked himself with a wan smile on his face . He stroked Elizabeth 's head gently , saddened by his own indecision and inner conflict . There was something he wanted and had never had . He wanted to let go in some wild way , to roar the way the fire had when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those days of self-control and sacrifice in his early twenties when he 'd worked and worked . Chicago andp330boyhood and Elsie and Elizabeth and Eva and Alice and his dying mother  --  what was he looking for ? A chunk of ashy log dropped off the grate . He heard the wind whistling in the chimney . Then it was quiet . And then he seemed to be confused by the quietness , and his own thoughts were enveloped in solitude . Elizabeth purred . He bent down and kissed her tenderly , telling himself that he would have to break off with Alice.  --  I ca n't help it ! I ca n't help it ! Bernard thought monotonouslyas he walked rapidly to the corner of Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue . Feeling driven , he hurried on to the Brevoort , passed the gray-haired uniformed doorman with averted eyes , started to leap up the stairs to the lobby , stopped , walked more slowly , and entered the elevator . " Five , " he said nervously to the elevator man . He should have walked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . He got off , walked a few feet along the corridor , and rapped at the door . In the fraction of a secondor so that he waited for a response he hoped she would n't be in , that she 'd stood him up . " Hello , " she called from the room . He had a sensation almost of disintegration . " Oh , it did n't take you long to get here , " she said after opening the door . He entered the room and sat down on the bed . He did n't know what to say . Alice yawned , stretched her arms , and said casually and nonchalantly : " I got tight last night . " He stared at her , trying to see her clearly  --  her rather thin face , her bobbed , burnished-looking hair , her restless small blue eyes . And her face . He saw it almost as in a mist . She looked characterless now , and there was nothing on her face . Why was he here ?  |p331He  got up , held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He kissed her silently , still with that feeling of being driven . " Someday I 'm going to be a writer . " " I hope so . " He wanted to believe she had some talent , but he could n't . He decided not to ask to see what she had written , because he wanted to avoid having to criticize it if he did n't like it . He turned and looked at her , her features now soft and relaxed , her hair mussed , her cheeks with the rather high cheekbonessomewhat shiny . She seemed like a girl , a little girl . He had the feeling of pity for her . Where , he asked himself , where was she going ?  --  And why in hell am I here ? All this sense of having been driven , of having had to come here was gone now . He felt let down , regretful . He could have stayed at home . It had n't been desire that had driven him , or so it seemed to him now . What had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stayed home and worked . This afternoon only proved to him that his life was there . And here he was , and yes , yes . . . .  --  Why in hell am I here ? " What are you thinking about , angel dove ? " " You , " he said quickly . He felt far away from her . Here they were , naked , in bed together , total strangers . " We 're like two people who fit and belong together , " she said . She leaned over and kissed him . " I 'm going to excite you , angel . " He was seized with apprehension . The room smelled musty , and the clothes flung around in disorder made it seem sordid . He wanted to leave , but he remained in bed.  | " I 'm going to prove I 'm a serious person . I 'm going to write . I 'm going to be a writer . " " I hope so . " " I want to show you my stuff . I want your honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read it . " " It 's different from your work . It 's mystical . I try to capturethe feelings you have . . . well , like this afternoon . " " What were they ? How did you feel ? How does sex feel to a woman ? " She puffed on her cigarette and looked at him curiously . " You 're just asking me biological questions . It 's the spiritualI want to put into my writing . It 's something . . . something that makes you organic with the world . It 's a feeling of harmony and wholeness . I like that word . Harmony . That 's what it gives me . Not just some smug feeling of being satisfied with myself , but a higher form of harmony . " Bernard only half listened . He was restless . He did n't know what to say . " I want a drink , " she said suddenly . " Let 's get one , " he quickly agreed . He was out of bed immediately and started to get dressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , once again sitting at a corner table at the Brevoort having Old Fashioneds . Alice was still talking of how sex was somethingmystic , beautiful , and creative . Yes , a full cycle since the afternoon three days ago . He felt completely let down , disappointed . For years this had been on his mind . For years the desire for another woman , for someone besides Elizabeth , had been hanging over his life . How many times had he daydreamedand felt frustrated ? And now it had happened . He could have done without this . And he also had the vague suspicion that he could n't trust Alice . He remembered Jake 's warning on the night he 'd first met her . And had n't she toldp333him she 'd given information to the Russians about her lover ? But what could she do to him ? What could she reveal about him ? Could he be blackmailed for having slept with her ? " Bernard , is anything wrong ? " Alice asked suddenly . " No , why ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . I feel all right . " " Poor Bernard , you angel , I must have tuckered you out . " " It 's not as bad as that . " He did n't like the remark . " It takes more out of a man than it does out of me , " she said blandly . " But it 's worth it , being tuckered out , angel face . " " Yes , " he said evasively . " Bernard , you 're a creative talent -- you 're not a politician , " Alice said with a solicitude that touched him . His mind was clouded by the three drinks he 'd had , and he was trying to convince himself he was glad to be with Alice . " Bernard , you do n't want to waste your time fighting the Party over the Socialists . I would n't sleep with a Socialist , " she said with contempt . " Suppose I became a Socialist ? " " You could n't be pale pink like that . " " Alice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , honey boy ? " " You 're politically confused . " " Bernard , I 'm serious . Please listen to me . I 'm in love with you , and I want you to listen to me . " " I 'll always listen to you , " he said with good-natured irony . " You ca n't lick the Party . Do n't fight it . You ca n't lick it . " " What do I care ? I ca n't lick the Catholic Church , either . But if I do n't like the Church , should I hide the fact ? " " That 's different  --  who cares about the Church ? "  | " Millions of people . But who cares about the Party  --  I mean here in America ? " " Bernard , I 've been to Russia . The Party is strong , and it 's never going to lose . That 's why I 'm for it , even if there are a lot of American mediocrities in its ranks . " Her manner changed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard , if you become an enemy of the Party , it will destroy you . It alwaysdestroys its enemies . " Bernard was momentarily puzzled by her , even though he realized she believed what she was saying . Suddenly he thought he could understand Sam and some of the other Communists better . They believed in the inevitable victory of the Party . This was fear , not faith . Or were faith and fear a combined motivation ? " Alice , " he said , " let 's not take this too seriously . Let 's have another drink . " He would not discuss the Party with her.  |p335BABY  PHILIP looked almost angelically sweet sitting in the play pen . He was absorbed in a set of Montessori blocks consisting of pegs that fitted into holes in a board . He took one after another and tried to fit it into his nose . Failing , he dropped the peg , laughed , and looked to his parents for approval , picked up another , felt it , examined it with interest , tried to fit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , laughed , and flung it aside . Finally he picked up a thinner peg and it fitted . He held it in his right nostril , looked at his parents again , and his face lit up with delight . " He 's achieved something on his first birthday , " Bernard said dryly . " Does n't he look like the most darling thing in the world ? " " He 's achieved a practical , pragmatic criticism of progressiveeducation , " Bernard went on . " I bought those blocks on the principle that Philip would learn while he was playing . I bought them because they 're educational toys . So he puts one in his nose . " " It is funny , is n't it ? " " He already seems to have learned what not to learn . " " Why ? What do you mean , Bernard ? " " And something else has just occurred to me . Honey , you know I talk about the downfall of civilization , about the rise of Socialism , about human culture from Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know a hell of a lot about a baby  --  my own baby , to be specific . " " But you can learn by giving him more time . "  | " I 've given him time  --  have n't I taken him out in his carriagelots of Sundays ? " " I know you have , Bernard dear . I 'm not complaining . I 'm only teasing you . " There were several woolly animals and rattles and other kinds of toys on the floor . The two babies , looking bewildered , sat playing , ignoring each other . Their parents , Bernard and Elizabeth , Frank and Patricia Kennedy , watched them . Joan , the Kennedy baby , was smaller than Philip . She was roundfacedand dark-eyed , with silky black hair that was beginning to come in thickly , and she looked very pretty in her pale pink dress . Frank Kennedy , a little plumper than he was when Bernardhad known him at the Y.M.C.A. in 1927 , looked contented , almost smug . He kept smiling genially . Patricia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty in an undistinguishedway . " It 's funny the way they pay no attention to each other , is n't it ? " Elizabeth remarked . " It 's not the age , " Patricia said . Joan knocked over a cloth giraffe , pushed it aside , and crawled about . " Maybe they 'll have a crawling contest , " Bernard said . " I should n't have dressed her up so , but I did n't think . This is her first party , " Patricia said . Patricia went to her daughter and knelt down : " Joan dear , that 's Philip . He 's your friend . He wants to play with you . He likes you  --  he 'd like to be your first boy friend . " Joan reached for her mother 's hair . " Tell her to pull Philip 's hair , " Bernard said . Patricia went back to sit beside Frank . Philip grabbed the giraffe , knocked it down , and hit it asp337it lay sidewise on the floor , laughing as he kept pounding the striped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you , Frank , and of the times you had at the Y.M.C.A. , and I 've sometimes walked past it on Twenty-third Street just to take a look at it , " Elizabeth said . " I was so glad when you called up the other day . I 've always wanted to meet you . " " I 've followed Bernard 's career in the newspapers , and I thought I 'd give him a ring to see him again . I can see he 's much more controlled now than he was then . He was a wild man in those days . " " His son takes after him , " Elizabeth commented lightly , as Philip began crowing as he crawled rapidly about the rug , knocking over a dog with which Joan was playing . Joan suddenly began to wail , and her mother rushed to quiet her . Elizabeth set the small mold of mashed bananas on the center of the little table she had so carefully laid for the two children . There was one green candle in the center of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled his off immediately , ripping it as he did . He let it fall beside him on the floor . " Have you got a camera , Bernard ? " Frank asked . " Not one that will take pictures indoors , " he answered . " I wish we had a movie camera , " Elizabeth remarked as shebent over the table . Frank and Bernard stood off , watching . Bernard was touched , and he felt that yesterday with Alice had been sordid . He wanted this home , he wanted it more than he did Alice . It was charming to see the two babies , with Elizabeth and Patricia hovering over the table . He looked at Frank . Certainly he would n't have an affair with anyone like Alice . He felt suddenly superior , as thoughp338he were living more fully . Then he felt foolish . All such thoughts were irrelevant and vain , he reflected . " I confess , Bernard , " Frank said , " I never expected to see you playing this role . But it 's good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't settled down after the harum-scarum time you had here in New York . " Bernard grinned . " Oh ! " Elizabeth exclaimed as Philip , with a sweep of his hand , knocked over a cup of milk . " It made my heart jump for a second , " Patricia said . " It 's only spilled milk , " Bernard said . " I guess they can play without their mothers for a few minutes , " Elizabeth said . The four parents sat in the large living room having a cocktail . It was beginning to get dark . " We 'll have to go in a few minutes , " Patricia said . " I ca n't get over how much you 've toned down , " Franksaid . " Is he always this quiet ? " he asked , turning to Elizabeth . " Oh , no , Bernard talks a lot  --  sometimes . " " Well , he 's certainly changed . When I knew him at the Y , you could n't keep him quiet . " " I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Patricia said . " And I used to laugh over what happened . I 'm still laughing  --  I got two divorce cases from that party I took Bernard to when he got drunk and broke it up , " Frank went on . " The world 's changed a lot since then , and Bernard has , too . He 's changed more for the better than the world has , though . Well , I 'm glad to see him such a success and behaving himself , too . " " What about you , Frank  --  were you an angel ? " Patricia asked . " God , no ! But I 've always tried to be civilized . " " Do you like practicing law , Frank ? " Bernard asked  | " Of course  --  I gave up newspaper work to go into it . " " Oh , Frank , I did n't know you were ever a newspaperman , " Elizabeth said . " Yes , I worked in Rochester . I lived at the Y because it was cheap , and Patricia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get on my feet . Now we 're getting along fine . " " Yes , next year we 're going to buy a home out on Long Island , " Patricia said . " New York is no place to bring up a child . And when we have more children , a home in the countrywill be good for them . I 'm not used to a small apartment . " " How about you , Bernard  --  you do n't have to live here in New York , do you ? " " I 'm afraid I 'm just thoroughly urbanized , " Bernard said . " Bernard , we really ought to buy a house outside the city , " Elizabeth said . " Of course , you have a very attractive place here , " Patricia said . " Yes , but I 'd like to have my own furniture and to fix things my own way , and with a child , owning your own house . . . " Elizabeth stopped and her face became wistful . Bernard did n't like the trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a sudden threat to him . He looked at Frank . He liked Frank and was glad to see him , but he thought Frank was smug and settled . In the old days at the Y , he used to think of Frank as a Philistine . And a complacentexistence with ownership might mean he 'd become too comfortable , too settled , and that his work might suffer . And he remembered , too , how , when he used to go by the homes out in Queens selling advertising for Monahan 's , he 'd sometimes tell himself he did n't want or need a home . " I 'd love to paint my own home , " Patricia said . " I 'd love to , too . I 'm always looking around here to see if there is n't something I can paint , " Elizabeth said.  | " The next time we go out looking at houses , maybe you and Bernard could come with us , " Patricia suggested . " Oh , I 'd love to , " Elizabeth responded eagerly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing , for it seemed to him the threat became greater the more they talked . " Bernard , we had a good , quiet day , did n't we ? " " Yes . " " And Philip and Joan  --  why , they hardly looked at each other . " " The celebration was for the parents . " " But they must have liked it  --  they got so much attention , and it was exciting for them . When Philip is older , we 'll have to tell him about his first birthday party . Why , I 'll bet you could even write a cute short story about it  --  I wish you would , Bernard . " " I will some time . " They were silent . Bernard thought of reading , or of listening to some records , but he was too restless and dissatisfied . What would he do for the rest of the evening  --  wait patiently for the time when he 'd go to bed ? " Bernard , " Elizabeth said moodily , " I want my own house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , honey ? " " Yes , but it 's not ours . " " What difference does it make if we 're comfortable . and happy ? " She looked at him , surprised and a little hurt . He knew it made a difference to her , but there was no difference for him . How could he explain to her that he did n't want to own things ? " It would be better for you , too  --  I 'd fix up the most comfortablestudio for you and  --  " " It does n't matter where I work , " he interrupted , and immediately knew that he 'd said the wrong thing.  | " Why do n't you want a home of our own , Bernard ? " " I 'm not necessarily against it , honey , but I 'd like to think it over . " If he did n't agree with her about buying a house , would n't he be acting selfishly ? But , damn it , he did n't want to own anything . Bernard was reading , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but her mind wandered as she read . She was disappointed and angry with Bernard because he did n't want her to have her own home . He was selfish . That 's what he was , just plain selfish . If he thought more of her and of Philip , he 'd see how important this was and agree without any argument . She looked at him over the top of the book . He was stretched out on the couch , reading away as if she did n't exist , as if nothing in the world existed but himself and his own thoughts and what he was reading . The old feeling of his being so far away from her came back . She had n't felt like this in a long time , even though he had been working hard and had often been very quiet . She had even spent whole days in the house with him hardly knowing he was there . These last couple of days , though , come to think of it , she 'd had a funny feeling about him  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what it was . And the way he had talked and not shown any enthusiasm tonight showed he did n't want them to have a home of their own or their own things . If what she asked of him really would hurt his work , of course she 'd feel differently , but she could n't , for the life of her , see how it could hurt his work . " Bernard ? " He did n't look up immediately . She watched him . He was concentrating on his book . His face had such an intense look on it ! Even though she was angry at him , she was rather proud of him for being able to concentrate as he did.  |p342But  why did n't he answer her ? Just as she was going to speak to him again , he looked up from his book and said absently : " Yes ? " " Bernard , is anything the matter ? " " No , why ? " She could tell he was far away from her . Maybe it would be better to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to him now . " Why should anything be the matter ? " he asked . She could n't know . Nobody had seen him going into the Brevoort , and even if he had been seen , what would that prove ? " Bernard , we 've always lived in rented rooms and hotels and furnished apartments , and since I 've had the baby everything is different . Bernard , I feel different , and I am different now , since Philip was born . Ca n't you understand ? " " Yes , " he answered , but he was apprehensive . " With an automobile , we could drive in to New York often . And we could have people out to see us  --  and it would n't interfere with your work . I should think you 'd work better . " Bernard looked off . Hunting for a place , checking on values , packing , buying things , moving , getting settled , the endless details involved  --  all this loomed in his mind as a boring waste of time . But this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did n't want to own anything exceptbooks . " Bernard , we can afford it now , and in the long run we 'd save money . " " Let 's think it over , Elizabeth . " " I 've been thinking it over for a long time , even if I have n't said much about it . And it will be so much better for Philip to grow up in the country , in his own home . " We do n't have to decide on a house this minute , " Bernard said.  |p343He  turned back to his book . Elizabeth watched him for a few minutes . " Bernard , " she said very seriously , " have you changed  --  changed in the way you feel toward me ? " Her question made him nervous.  --  I 've got to sit here and lie , he told himself . " No  --  not essentially . " " Not essentially ? " " Honey , after living together as long as we have , we do take some things for granted . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But are you tired of me ? " " No . " He paused , wondering what to say . He knew now that he really did n't want Alice . Would he be able to break off with her amicably and secretly ? " No , honey , why should I be tired of you ? " " Men sometimes do grow tired of their wives , do n't they ? " She could n't really know or have any real evidence for suspicion , could she ? " Honey , what 's the matter ? " he asked . He wanted to tell her about Alice now and to have it forgotten , just as he 'd wanted to the other night , but he knew he could n't  --  and should n't . " Nothing , except sometimes . . . sometimes I . . . I do n't know , Bernard . It 's the way I feel . " " If I do n't know how you feel , how can I  --  " He stopped short . He was n't being fair to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop it . " Elizabeth gazed at him questioningly . She wanted to drop it . She wanted Bernard to love her , and she wanted him to buy a home for all of them , and she did n't want to quarrel or talk this way , only . . . she just had a feeling that something was wrong . " Bernard , I know how important your work is  --  but so is Philip . Philip and I are important , too , and I just think that sometimes you do n't feel we are . "  | " Honey , of course I do , " he protested , but he was hurt by his own duplicity . Sometimes when Bernard stayed up to read , she liked to fall asleep like this , thinking of the events of the day , of herselfand her life , of Bernard and Baby Philip , and of the future  --  just thinking whatever came into her mind . She 'd been foolish tonight and felt a little ashamed of herself , because she 'd almost been at the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , because Bernard had been sweet and loving to her , and she was sure he loved her and her baby . Goodness , but what if she were wrong and he did n't love her ? She sat up in the dark bedroom , alarmed . She whimpered and sank back in the bed , curled up , put her hands over her face , and bit her lip . What would she do if Bernard did n't love her any more and they were separated and divorced ? She could always go back home to her father and mother . She imagined herself going home with the baby , deserted , and falling into her mother 's arms in tears . She wanted to cry . It would be so humiliating . And it would hurt her father and mother , and they would feel so shamed , too , because they loved her , and she could n't bear to think of herself wheelingthe carriage and going out with Baby Philip , with people in Chicago looking at her and knowing she 'd been deserted . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about " the undertaker 's daughter ? " She wanted to cry , but she could n't . She was sadder , she thought , than she had ever been in her whole life . Suppose Bernard died ? She could see herself in black , looking at Bernard in her father 's place , and people sympathizing with her , and herself crying because Bernard was dead and she would never see himp345again or hear him talk , and part of herself would be dead , dead like their first baby , and she would be all alone with Baby Philip , and with her father and mother , and she .. . She was sobbing loudly in the darkened bedroom . Hearing Elizabeth 's sobs , Bernard dropped his book , sat up , and then bolted upstairs to the bedroom . " Elizabeth ? Elizabeth ? " he called out apprehensively as he rushed into the room . Elizabeth went on sobbing as though she had n't heard him . Bernard switched on the light and saw her agonized and tear-stained face . " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd almost asked her what he 'd done . " I do n't know , " she said between sobs , in a hurt , childish tone . He was puzzled and irritated for a moment . Then he sat down at the side of the bed . He took her hand and asked quietly : " Elizabeth , tell me what 's the matter . " She gazed at him apologetically . Her eyes were glistening with tears . " I was just sad . " " But why ? " " I do n't know . Please do n't ask me why  --  I do n't know . I was just blue . " " But , honey , tell me what 's the matter . " " Nothing is , now . I was just sad . I 'm sorry , Bernard , andplease do n't be cross with me . Sometimes everybody getssad . " She smiled wistfully . " You wo n't be cross with me ? " " Of course not , " he assured her , but she was still troubled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head from side to side . " Tell me what made you sad . "  |p346Elizabeth  did n't answer . She could n't tell him . She could n't tell anyone the thoughts she 'd had . " I must have been dreaming . I had an awful dream . " " What was it about ? " " I do n't remember it . It was just awful . " Somehow this did n't seem true to him , but he was relieved and was glad to let well enough alone . He kissed her tenderly . " You get some sleep now , honey , " he said . Elizabeth was asleep , and the house was quiet . But he could n't read and he did n't want to sleep . He wanted to write , but knew that at this moment he could n't write a line . Elizabeth'sinexplicable outburst had upset him . Did it have anything to do with him ? He knew he need n't ask himself this question , for her life was so bound up with his that her unhappinessmust be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do with her wanting him to agree to buy a house ? He guessed it must . He ought to agree , just as he 'd agreed to take out insurance . Looking at it merely as a practical question of living , she was right , her desire was reasonable . Bernard got up and began to pace the floor , trying to control his growing nervousness . He wished he could instantly put all the pieces of his life together and see it , and himself , with clarity and objectivity . He sat down again . It was nighttime in Chicago , too . Was his mother asleep , or was she awake moaning in pain ? Was Mr. Whelan asleep or up and out on a case , walking into a house of death to take some corpse away in a long black box ? Was Alice asleep ? Was she with some man right now ? Why had Elizabeth acted that way ? What would he say and what would he do if she found out ?  --  I never believed it would be permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p347Yes  , it was true . He had never totally accepted or assimilatedthe idea of living with Elizabeth permanently . He wanted to deny the validity of his own insight , but that was impossible . He could n't fool himself.  |p348THIS  afternoon he 'd read the three chapters of Alice 's novel-in-progress she 'd given him . She 'd told him it had taken her over a year to write them . The chapters were chaoticand pretentious . What would he tell her about them ? What could he tell her ? " I 'm so relieved and happy that Baby Philip is better , " Elizabeth said . " I am too . " They were having dinner . His thoughts wandered . What would he do if he were living alone ? He 'd thought of this often of late , imagining himself living a free life . Did he want to be free , just to be free ? Did he want to be free just to be able to go on and have love affairs with girls like Alice ? Last week it had been grueling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three and a hundred and four ; he 'd been in a state of agony . " The baby was so terribly sick . When I would look at him and see him so helpless and so listless and know he was suffering , I 'd just wish I could suffer for him . . . . " " Yes , " Bernard agreed . Even though he had asked her not to do it , Alice had called him twice while the baby was ill , but fortunately Elizabethhad n't been near the telephone . If he did n't call her back , she might telephone again . But , even so , he could n't seem to bring himself to do it . Philip 's sickness had afforded him an excuse for not seeing her , but he 'd have to call her tomorrow . And that last time in the hotel room he had n't really wanted her and had just gone through the motions.  |p349He  might find himself more deeply involved , and then Elizabeth would find out , and everything would blow up . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's have a drink , " Bernard answered . He had made up his mind to break off with Alice , but he was concerned and unsure as to how to tell her . He 'd held imaginaryconversations with her , explaining why he thought they ought to stop now ; he 'd brooded and harassed himself over his decision and this meeting . He did n't want to hurt her . He was somewhat afraid she 'd make a scene . He was sitting here , postponing telling her minute after minute . He nodded to the waiter and ordered two Old Fashioneds . The drink might help him . " You look glum and down in the mouth , angel . " " I 've had a bad week . " " You should have come to see me and let me cheer you up . You 've been home too much and working too hard . The way you 're working , you 'll dry yourself up . Baby , you need to let yourself lie fallow for a while . Look at me . I spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel . " " It was n't my work , it was my baby . He was very sick . Elizabeth was up most of two nights , and I was , too . " " But you did n't have much to do , did you , honey child ? Did n't Elizabeth take care of the baby ? " " Yes , but . . . " He was sorry to see her so lacking in understanding of the simplest human feelings . He 'd been a fool ever to get mixed up with her , and he was absolutely right in ending the affair , though he felt very sorry for her . " Artists should n't be fathers , " Alice said . " What should they be ? " he asked , thinking this was mere chatter . " Free . Free to live so they can be artists . You know I'mp350right , Bernard . This week you have n't been able to work becausethe baby was sick . " " I was worried . Nothing tears you up the way the sight of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rip you apart . The mere sight of a helpless , suffering , feverish baby wrenched me as I 'd never been in my life before . " Alice did n't seem to react to what he 'd said . " He 's better now  --  he 's out of the woods . " " So you can see me ? " He hesitated with " no " on the tip of his tongue . He still delayed telling her . All the imaginary conversationshe 'd had with her these last few days , the ways he 'd thought of bringing up the question , the approaches , the reasons for breaking up  --  all of it went out of his mind now . He did n't know how best to say it . " Bernard , I do n't want you to be angry with me . " " But I 'm not angry with you . Why should I be angry with you ?
