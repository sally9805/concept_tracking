In 1952 , a city-room earthquake rocked the morning San Francisco Chronicle , and 38 staffers disappeared from view , including Boy Wonder Editor Paul Smith ( TIME , Dec. 22 , 1952 ) . Before the shakeup , the Chronicle had a studious and often dull international bent , a slipping circulation of 155,205 ( down 20,356 in five years ) , and an annual deficit of $1,000,000 . Last week , edited as though the world began at San Francisco Bay and ended at the Golden Gate , the Chronicle was proudly-and accurately-calling itself the nation 's fastest-growing major daily both in ads and circulation . <P> Prime shaker of the quake that started the Chronicle rolling was energetic Assistant Publisher Charles de Young Thieriot , who later became editor and publisher . A descendant of Charles and Michael de Young , teen-age brothers who founded the Chronicle in 1865 on a borrowed $20 gold piece , Thieriot gave the job of blowing a fresh breeze through the Chronicle 's fogbound pages to suave Scott Newhall , also a member of a leading San Francisco family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old makeup of sober type marching row on row for a blaze of bold , black headlines , launched syndicated Lovelornist Abigail Van Buren ( TIME , Jan. 20 , 1957 ) , assembled a cast of 20 home-town columnists . " International news , " declares Thieriot , " is not what people want to read at breakfast . " <P> But Thieriot and Newhall still lacked just the man to turn the liberal Republican Chronicle into a breakfast treat instead of a treatment : curly-haired , puckish San Franciscophile Herb Caen ( pronounced Cane ) , 43 , the columnist who defected to Hearst 's morning Examiner in 1950 for a doubled salary of $30,000 . In 1957 , Prodigal Son Caen decided to return ( for $38,000 a year ) , leaving the Examiner ( circ. 257,251 ) with little humor to perk up its somber pages . " The day I knew we had come around the corner , " says Publisher Thieriot , " is the day Herb Caen decided to come back . " Looking over his figures for 1958 , Thieriot had good evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city-room staff had done a good job of boosting the Chronicle : in a recession year , the paper gained 1,248,313 lines in advertising , soared 31,029 in circulation to reach a new high of 225,429.
