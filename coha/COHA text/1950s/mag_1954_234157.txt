With Kirsten Flagstad , Helen Traubel and Lauritz Melchior departed from the Met , Wagnerian opera has gone into one of its periodic U.S. declines . From eight productions ( including the four-evening Ring cycle ) in 1940-41 , the Met 's offerings of Wagner now run to only about three productions a season . Meanwhile , Wagner fans keep their ears peeled for heroic-voiced artists to build up the schedule again . <P> Latest hopeful is Philadelphia-born Margaret Harshaw , 41 , who is gradually shouldering a greater load of heavy Wagnerian leads . Big ( 5 ft. 8 in. ) and strong enough to brandish a spear handily and with enough stamina to last out a four-hour opera , Soprano Harshaw seems a natural Wagnerian . She arrived at the Met in 1942 as a contralto , gradually developed her high notes until she became a full-fledged soprano . A fortnight ago , she began belting out impressive " ho-yo-to-hos " in one of Wagner 's grandest roles - the helmeted goddess Briinnhilde in Die Walkure-with such success that some critics were comparing her with Flagstad herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olin Downes of the New York Times , " was the tenderness , the depth and subtlety of her scene with Wotan and the sweeping drama of the ensuing passage with Siegmund . " Wrote the World-Telegram &; Sun 's Robert Bagar : " The lady did herself-as well as Wagner-proud . . . And she sprang about with something approaching the graceful . " <P> But mid-season 1954 shows few signs of a real Wagner boom , either in the U.S. or abroad . The favorite operas , Lohengrin , Tannhduser and Tristan are lucky to get three or four performances a month at La Scala , Paris and London . The 13-hour Ring cycle ( Rheingold , Walkure , Siegfried , Gotterdammerung ) is all but impossible to mount in small theaters , gets its chief performances nowadays at the Wagner shrine in Bayreuth . Like many German opera houses , the Vienna Staatsoper was bombed out , will not attempt the Ring cycle until rebuilding is completed in 1956 . Covent Garden 's policy : no Ring until another Flagstad turns up . <P> The Metropolitan , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a natural spot for the Ring . Today , says General Manager Rudolf Bing , it would cost as much in time and money to prepare it as five ordinary Verdi or Puccini operas , but would draw crowds for only about ten performances as compared with 30-odd for the Italian favorites . This year the Met is enjoying full houses ( at about $19,000 a night ) for its Rigoletto and La Boheme , while , even with Soprano Harshaw , performances of Tann-huser and Walkure find about 10% of the seats empty . <P> This does not stop the eagerness of the Wagner enthusiasts for more productions . " I am likely to get 100 or more earnest letters a year demanding more , " says Bing . " But this does n't seem to be Wagner 's era at the box office . "
