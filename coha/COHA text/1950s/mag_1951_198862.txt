" It is in a spirit of awe and fright that I rise to make a few remarks , " said Illinois ' Senator Paul Douglas , and grimly tackled the $61 billion defense appropriation . Since the bill would " turn over one-fifth of our national economy to the military , " he thought it deserved a thorough scrutiny on the Senate floor . <P> Conscientious Democrat Douglas , who drives himself beyond the capacity of most men and the inclination of most Senators , had spent several months looking for soft spots in the bill . The Douglas finger jabbed at old military featherbeds . He wanted to save $50 to $100 million by cutting off flight pay of Air Force officers who did not fly . He proposed to reduce the ratio between combat men and supporting personnel . He suggested that the Navy did not need 95 new luxury planes , costing $215 million , for VIPs . In all , he claimed , his cautious cuts would total nearly $1 billion . <P> " How Difficult It Is . " Instantly Wyoming 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Appropriations subcommittee which had pored over the bill for twelve weeks , he would be the first to agree that there might be waste , said O'Mahoney unctuously . " But I should not like to have any person reading the Congressional Record tomorrow morning gather from what my friend from Illinois has said that the men in uniform . . . are willfully making more mistakes than those which are made by all human beings . " <P> " The Senator from Wyoming has just shown how difficult it is , " said Douglas ruefully . " Every time we offer suggestions as to how money could be saved . . . then the implication is made that we are somehow attacking the character or patriotism of men in the departments . " <P> O'Mahoney : " My purpose ... is to make clear that he was not intending to attack the patriotism or devotion of these men in uniform . " <P> Douglas : " I did not intend that . . . " <P> O'Mahoney interrupted : " If the Senator will permit me . " Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head on his folded arms as O'Mahoney droned on : " If I were to keep silent , I can imagine the words of the Senator from Illinois being read tomorrow morning and by some representative of Tass . being broadcast behind the Iron Curtain misinterpreting his meaning to indicate a lack of faith among American members of Congress in the men who work , who fight , and who die for them . " <P> Douglas jumped up , clapped his hands to his head , and let out a high-pitched scream of wordless exasperation . He stumbled down the aisle as O'Mahoney , pincenez in hand , watched openmouthed . Outside , Douglas flopped down on a couch , tears spilling down his cheeks . Someone put a cold towel on his head . Half an hour later , he was back in his seat . <P> " This Is So Huge . " Most Senators could sympathize . Many of them would like to cut the bill too , but lacked the nerve or the knowledge . As Douglas had pointed out , " the average tendency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can not cope with it . We will trust the Department of Defense and we will trust our committee , which is a noble committee . I can not do anything . I will stay in my office and write letters . ' "
