A tong time from now the first nuclear bomb fell in Europe and in the United States people were moving away from places that might soon not exist . Perhaps it is not such a long time from now and perhaps it is never . N O V E M B E R is the month of the dead and on All Saints Day of that month yellow flores de muerte are hung in the doorways of the adobe huts in Mexico . They are arranged carefully in the form of the cross on the many graves and they are interset with candles . The men on horseback had ridden through the sharp yellowness of the flowers of the dead two hours before and now from the edge of the barranca in the rapid-coining darkness they could see the faint blur of the candles celebrating death . The seven men sat astride their horses without movement and without speaking . Twenty minutes before they had ridden to a point directly below them , descended abruptly from their horses , and felled a tree across the highway . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road for the American car to appear they did not breathe heavily . One of them dropped the end of a cigarette and a horse pawed into the adobe and then swung its big head before it ceased . Now the heavy roll of the bells of Tico began again . They had been unremitting on this day of our dead since the horsemen had begun the journey . The peons will stand for hours for their turn to ring the bells on this day for their dead . If they pull long and extra hard for their dead they know the Lord will look on them with favor in his eyes . One of the horsemen spat . It was the same horseman who  --  when they had ridden through Tico in the heavy tolling , he , at the head of them ? had ridden differently with his back straight , riding as one not asleep , riding as the old ones remembered Black . Jack 's men had ridden , swing-ing loosely and straight up on their McClellan saddles , chasing Villa and Villa asleep , bored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their rare horsese had gotten into Tico as far as the outdoor zapateria of joie Ruiz , the outlander had doubled back within the others , flowed back through the huge sombreros of the six , ridden alone to the blinding white wedding-cake front of the Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Immaculate Conception and allowed his horse to drink from the heart-shaped fountain of the Blood of Our Saviour . No one gave him their eyes . . The iron beating of the bells fell with the steadiness of almost fierce patience as the man twirled his horse on its hind hooves with style and rode out of town , freely yet erect , followed by the six waiting at joie Ruiz ' ; they slowly diminished into the wavy sand going fast toward the edge of low hills faintly suggested in the shimmering dazzle of the heat waves that shifted and began again their illusions in the recurrent dry wind of Baja Sonora . " Kill all the cingaros ! " It was turning cool now . Where the seven waited at the edge of the barranca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pass , the blur of the candles of Tico became distinct as the cold and the darkness came on . The rider who had spoken was one of the six . He had spoken to himself but as he reset but without their strength . Her dark blue eyes were overlarge ; her heavy lips on a short mouth and her up-tilted nose gave her face a constant , amazed , wondering quality . Her breasts were heavy for her age , nineteen , but were in keeping with the dust-jacket pictures on contemporary American fiction , which she knew . Bozzie had just returned from a little tour of the continent . She had spent most of her time in Paris . It had been planned that she stay in Switzerland but she had hated , hated , ? hated it . It was like a church with the radiators turned off , she said . Now Paris  --  Paris was fres , tres chic . She wanted to go there again soon , she said , when things quieted down . She was engaged to Choo Choo Traine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chao Choo cute but dull , Paris and Creighton sophisticated and exciting . Creighton had been on his way to the international auto races at Monte Carlo . He drove for the British team . The Italians in their Maseratis ran away with it but Creighton got drunk and made a joke of the defeat . Then they had gone to Vence , a small town in the hills back of Cannes and were very , very happy until Creighton had to go back to his wife and family in Birmingham , something he had n't told her about . Still he had n't not told her about it , she thought , and she stopped dabbing with the puff . And what was so very wrong with Choo Choo ? She saw Choo Choo jump off the bench in a red and gold uniform and she saw him go over the goal line standing up , his small hips swinging easily under his false shoulders and heard the feminine squeal beneath the deep roar of the stadium . She saw Choo Choo reading the comic snips on the floor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-Thirty Club and an outstanding local booster . There was nothing wrong with Choo Choo , nothing wrong at all with Cho ? Choo . She sighed and looked unhappily into the silver inlaid mirror as the car swerved . Yes , that 's what was wrong with Choo Choo  --  nothing . In the twilight she watched Mexico going by the car . She repeated the word to herself ? " Mexico . " It had an exotic ring and the landscape was strange . The abrupt and weird attitudes of the cacti were like the pictures of modern people at the Salon d'Antoonne . Lawrence had loved it and how she had worshiped Lawrence . Or was it Huxley ? Someone had filled her library hours at Vassar with the strange . blood-sacrificial rites of the Mayas , the hot blood-enduring passion of weird Indian cults . It was Lawrence , she was certain of that . Yet Aldous Huxley had written something too . Mexico , land of the conquistadores. land of The Plumed Serpent and Beyond the Mexique Bay . She clicked off her light and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country reminds me of something I read in the papers . It seems a hitchhiker murdered somebody who gave him a lift in Arizona , then he fled down here into Mexico , got another lift with a family of tourists and murdered them all too . " " Oh , you never told me you 'd been reading the newspapers , Williams . Never thought you read anything but the Wall Street Journal . " Mr. Williams did n't answer . He was looking at the man sitting on the drop seat beside him . Mr. Elphick had cultivated him in the hotel bar at Hermosillo . While in the car , outside of small talk about the rainy season and the possibility of sailfish out of Huatabampo , he had been silent . The man 's legs were too long for his position ; he was able to rest his chin on his arms folded over his knees . While it was still light he looked at the landscape carefully from this position , watching the cliffs and the varicolored formations intently . His features were regular yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his long forehead when the car lurched and he would push it back with a wiping motion . Mr. Williams guessed him at about thirty-five , thought him concerned about something . and knew what it was . It was what they were all concerned about . The car shifted itself now as it began to climb for the pass and they all braced themselves as it swung into the first cutback . for a train . But do n't pump him . He has already earned his ride in the bar . " Mr. Elphick leaned with the roll of the car , trying to save his drink . " That this road is slightly oriented in some direction may be true , but since the last hour I began to lean toward the entirely random school . " " Are you , Mr. Guthrie , " Bozzie said abruptly , " a vitalist or a finalist ? " " What she means is , are you married , " Mr. Elphick said . " Or do you , " Bozzie said , " hold the more materialistic view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bozzie said " And if so ? " Mr. Elphick said . " And if so , " Bozzie said , " what instruments does science have to disprove the metaphysical ? " " None , " Guthrie said , " hut we can examine the results . " " Yes , " Mr. Elphick said into his drink , " yes , but this road is not oriented but truly random and Bozzie really wants to know if you are married . " " Papa , I want to get at the heart of the matter . " " Being a woman you will get at the heart and past that to the viscera and the tortilla in the . viscera , " Mr. Elphick said . " I only want Mr. Guthrie to tell me what forces have been acting throughout the history of life . " B A NDITS . " The voice of Ulysses came back through the communication system . " We 've been going by bandits for the last hundred yards . " They could see the dim skeleton shape of oil rigs among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Marxist , " Mr. El-pluck said , watching . " It 's that I had a set-to with the oil companies and we have a private joke . " " I did n't think there was oil in this formation , " Guthrie said , thinking . " There is n't , " Mr. Elphick said . " Ed Pauley 's wasting his time and so is Bozzic . " Mrs. Elphick reared back her head as though surveying the scene but she was still thinking about the greenhouses at Rancho Paraiso and the camellia cross and the continuous beginning smile of the refugee Trappist monk she had tamed who had now dedicated his life to the camellia cross . His red Herbert Hoover cross had been a failure , true enough , but an interesting one and who could say that his letter to Organic . Gardening might not create a tempest allof its own  --  and about his being a Trappist monk , you would never know . When people get very close to the earth they are difficult . Perhaps it was only his love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a means of worming his way into the greenhouse . Still let him experiment . He might come up with an interesting cross , and they had already decided to name it after their goat who had suffered disappointment after disappointment at the San Fernando Valley Fair . Bozzie was in pursuit and Tom maybe had had a little too much with that nice fossil boy and Mr. Williams did n't have any lines . Someone should write him some lines , she thought , so that he could sandwich a speech ill between the speeches of the others . " I 'm sorry , " Bozzie said from her corner , " but I ca n't buy it without the big picture . EveryOne is trying to crowd me off into the little picture but I ca n't dig it without the big Darwinian picture . Or do I sound like a square ? " she said toward Guthrie . " No , " Guthrie said confused . " No , you sound  --  well , you arc  --  how would you say it  --  you are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big picture . " " I mean maybe my Freud is rusty , " Bozzie said seriously , removing the cigarette from her mouth . " I mean , but he did comment on paleontology ? He said he could not understand , in view of the validity of the death wish , how certain species could have survived almost indefinitely . I mean , briefly , " she said , " Freud saw within man two powerful drives  --  the life drive which is mostly libido and the death drive ? " " Which is mostly death , " Mr. Elphick helped . " No , " Bozzie said . " So man inhibits himself to balance these instinctual drives . If he fails or succeeds anxiety is produced along with fears  --  a fear of losing a part of himself  --  not , according to Homey , necessarily just his sex . " " Not just what , child ? " Mrs. Elphick asked " cautiously . " I was speaking scientifically , Mother , " Bozzie said hopelessly . " I was referring to Horney 's extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Neurotic Personality of Our Time , Norton , 1937 . " " Oh , I thought you were referring to sex , " Mrs. Elphick said . " Dig Mother on sex referrals , " Bozzie beamed . " Is n't she sensational ? " " We only want our money returned that the Vassar people took , " Mrs. Elphick said definitely . " Will you buy Harney or Freud ? " Bozzie said , excited , to Guthrie . " I do n't want to go interesting-features on you or even metaphysical on you , " Bozzie said across to Guthrie . " You 'd probably resent that , so let 's say I 'm going extrasensory on you . " Bozzie hesitated then relaxed back into the heavy seat away from all of them until she finally said what they had been avoiding for so long ? " I see an evil cloud lifting into the sky , shaped not like a horse but more like a giant white frog ? " Guthrie lost his grip on his drink and it ended up soaking the red carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bozzie said . " You know sometimes the therapist will dig for months to touch a key that will give an eino- ? tional response worth exploring . Ferenczi tried to shorten this period by urging the patient to give up all sexual indulgence , and cut down the time of the complete toilet . Even eating and drinking should he cut down during the period of therapy . He thought in this way he could increase the intensity of the therapeutic hour . Soon he came to the blind end , however , that the reaction he was observing was not the repression he was trying to explore  --  liberate , I suppose is better . Now a true student would find your reaction to when I said it was not so much a horse that the great shadow was , more a white giant frog ? " " Bozzie Lamb . " " Yes , Mommikins . " " Shut up , " her mother said , T HE BIG car began to turn now in a great circle . When it completed its circle it was going in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , Mr. Elphick picked up the inter-coin and talked in quick and abrupt words with Ulysses . When he finished they were still headed back toward the States . " He says he is willing to hitchhike back if we want to continue into Mexico , " Mr. Elphick said to the others . No one said anything , they were all studying their shoes . There was an occasional jolt from the power brakes as the car went down a sheer valley under compression . " He said you ca n't walk away from anything . He does n't get a chance to talk up there so he thinks . He believes he thinks too much alone up there but this is what lie thinks  --  that we are getting nowhere at all and would never get anywhere at all because you ca n't walk away from anything at all . " Mr. Elphick looked annoyed and thoughtful at the neck of the Negro driving in the wrong MAGAZINE direction , began to give an order , then felt someone 's hand touch him and he ceased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but everyone continued to examine the floor . But this is only a vacation , " Mrs. Elphick said finally . " Only an extended vacation , " Mr. Elphick agreed as the others remained silent , continuing . to examine the carpet . The big car under deep throttle rocked along the floor of the valley , getting ready to hunch up the big ocher mountain , its bright chrome flashing like a heliograph in the last sun as it climbed back toward the United States . A L L OVER the world November is the month of the dead and on All Saints Day of that month yellow flares de muerte are hung in the doorways of the adobe huts in Tico . They are arranged carefully in the form of the cross on the many graves and they are interset with candles . The bandits on horseback had ridden through the sharp yellowness of the flowers of the dead three hours before and now from the edge of the barranca in the rapid-coming darkness they could see the faint blur of the candles celebrating death . The seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some time before they had ridden to a point directly below them , descended abruptly from their horses and felled a tree across the highway . Now they watched in perfect silence up the ravaged road as the American car turned back and disappeared . One of them dropped the end of a cigarette and a horse pawed into the adobe and then swung its big head before it ceased . Now the heavy roll of the bells of Tico began again . They had been unremitting on this day of our dead since the horsemen had begun the journey . The peons will stand for hours for their turn to ring the bells on this-day for our dead . If they pull long and extra hard for our dead they know the Lord will look on us with courage in his eyes .
