The Caine Mutiny Court Martial ( adapted from his novel by Herman Wouk ) comes off thoroughly good theater - and not least because it shuns the overtly theatrical . For stage purposes , Novelist Wouk has so backgrounded and built up the court-martial scene of his Caine Mutiny as to suggest a shipboard drama of events through a courtroom drama of character . Charles Laughton has staged the production with a superbly unswerving sense of the whole . Building slowly , the play at length walls in , not the court-martialed Lieut . Maryk , but his accuser , Commander Queeg , skipper of the destroyer-minesweeper U.S.S. Caine . <P> There is much , beyond the pulse of the story , to enhance the court-martial setup . The charge against Maryk of seizing com mand during a typhoon on the ground that Queeg was mentally ill - is an un hackneyed one . Again , Maryk 's lawyer , Lieut . Barney Greenwald , would far rather be prosecuting than defending his client - and indeed wins him an acquittal by not defending him . Instead , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail , then twists the knife in an emotionally frayed and rattled Queeg . And there is the final celebration scene , a sort of moral coda in which Greenwald , more than mildly drunk , berates his own tactics and denounces the real villain of the " mutiny . " <P> Theater tactics , like trial tactics , run to throwing a certain amount of dust in people 's eyes ; and in places The Caine Mutiny Court Martial has been slicked up , speeded up , shaped to measure for that treasure house of behaviorism , a courtroom . But the maneuvers always have pertinence : thus , the easy laughs at the expense of the psychiatrist are an integral part of the trial itself , not just a fillip for the show . What is sharp in the play is all the sharper for what is deliberately flat ; no one understands better than Director Laughton the counter-theatricalism of the quiet manner . <P> The most vivid conflicts in the play are self-conflicts : Queeg 's agonized attempts to keep a grip on his emotions , Greenwald 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Queeg , Lloyd Nolan plays brilliantly , is as self-revealing when still in control as when losing control . Henry Fonda 's sober courtroom Greenwald is in fine contrast both to Queeg and to Greenwald drunk . The whole cast , from John Hodiak 's Maryk on , is admirable : out of the stylized nature of the court-martial has been forged just the right style for a theater piece .
