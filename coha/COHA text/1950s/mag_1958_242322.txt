Indiscreet ( Grandon ; Warner ) , in the Broadway version ( Kind Sir ) , was the sort of romantic comedy that is all dressed up but obviously has no place to go-but then , Broadway scarcely has the resources that are required to gild this sort of lulu . Instead of $100,000 , the movie 's Producer-Director Stanley Donen had about $1,500,000 to squander . Instead of painted flats , he had the city of London for his backdrop , and some of the city 's stateliest halls for his interiors . Instead of nature 's timid hues , he had Technicolor . Instead of a couple of merely famous names-Mary Martin and Charles Boyer-on his marquee , he had two of the biggest that have ever been in the business-Ingrid Bergman and Gary Grant . <P> Bergman plays an actress-world-renowned , spectacularly attractive , loaded with money-who lives all alone , next door to Buckingham Palace , in an apartment the size of an armory , with nothing but a couple of dozen Picassos and Rouaults and Dufys to keep her company , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grant plays a wizard of international finance - world- renowned , spectacularly attractive , loaded with money-who falls in love with the girl , and expresses his affection in those little things that women appreciate so much : yachts , paintings , diamond bracelets . <P> In fact , just about the only thing this paragon does not give his paramour is his name . " I 'm sorry , " he says sadly , " but I 'm married , and I ca n't get a divorce . " She accepts the explanation along with his advances , but a few months later she discovers that he is really not married at all . Naturally enough , the lady is vexed . " How dare he make love to me and not be a married man ! " And she hatches an absurdly sinister plot , involving " the other man , " to make the bluffer suffer . But the plot miscarries in a very funny scene , and before long , the relationship is satisfactorily altared . <P> In short . Indiscreet is a conventional comedy of what Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in the high old style of hilarity that U.S. moviemakers seem to have forgotten in recent years . Director Donen deserves a cash-register-ringing cheer . Actress Bergman , always lovely to look at , is thoroughly competent in the first comedy role that she has played for Hollywood . And Gary Grant is in a class by himself when it comes to giving a girl a yacht . <P> <P> Cinerama-South Seas Adventure <P> ( Stanley Warner Cinerama Corp. ) makes a radical departure from the four Cinerama films that preceded it ( and grossed $74 million along the way ) . It attempts a story . In fact , it attempts five of them . But in the end , after having been carted all over the South Pacific , viewers will feel as travelogy as ever .
