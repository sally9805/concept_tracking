In the oil-rich Williston Basin , a Shell Oil Co. wildcat crew last week brought in a well near Baker , Mont . that gushed oil at the rate of 4,253 barrels a day . It was the richest well yet drilled in the basin . <P> In bringing in its fifth producer out of eight wells drilled in the Montana section of the basin , Shell had apparently tapped a rich new pool . The new well showed that there are five different levels of oil-producing strata , as shallow as 6,800 ft . The oil itself was high quality , easy to refine . <P> The find gave an added fillip to some oil shares on the stock market , notably those with land in the area , such as Montana Dakota Utilities and Northern Pacific Railway , which holds about 6,000 of the 11,372 acres believed to be in the oil area around the well . By week 's end , Northern Pacific 's stock was up 4 ? points to 73 ? .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
