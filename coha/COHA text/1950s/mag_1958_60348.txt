This magazine is in receipt of a transcript of a most unusual conversation that took place this week between Tim Tam and Jewel 's Reward , a pair of 3-year-old Thoroughbreds who are expected to uphold the honor of the East against Silky Sullivan , the pride and sensation of the West , in the Kentucky Derby on May 3 . The conversation took place in the early morning at Hialeah Park in Florida and was overheard by a stable pony who reported it to SPORTS ILLUSTRATED . Tim Tam and Jewel 's Reward were in a little knot of horses near the entrance to the track , waiting their turn to take their regular morning exercise . An exercise boy atop one of the horses verified important parts of this conversation , which proves , incidentally , that Silky Sullivan is the most talked-of horse of the decade , even among horses who are notoriously close-mouthed . The boy 's name and that of the pony are being withheld for obvious reasons . Tim Tam will be identified as T.T . and Jewel 's Reward as J.R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // J.R. : Yes , it is I. // T.T. : Have you been reading about that show Sullivan put on ? // J.R. : I 'm never up when Ed 's show is on . // T.T. : I do n't mean Ed Sullivan . I mean Silky Sullivan . // J.R. : That 's a horse on me. // T.T. : You 're sure feeling your oats , Jewelie Boy , but let me tell you it 'll be a horse of another color when we have to run against him in the Florida Derby . // J.R. : O.K. , O.K. , simmer down , Tim , I can read and I see by The Morning Telegraph that Silky Sullivan is n't going to come east for the Florida Derby after all . We do n't have to worry about him until the Kentucky Derby . // T.T. : Are you sure , Jewelie ? // J.R. : Sure I 'm sure . I got it straight from Oscar Otis ' mouth in the Telegraph . // T.T. : Well , then , that 's different . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silky his comeuppance in the Run for the Roses ? // J.R. : If your plan is n't any better than that last clich ? , we might as well scratch ourselves right now and let Mrs. Graham and Mrs. Markey run for us. // T.T. : Hear me out , Jewelie . Remember what happened the last time you fouled me ? // J.R. : Oh , sorry , that 's another horse on me. // T.T. : This time we 've got to work together for the good of eastern bloodlines . Would you want your sister to marry Silky Sullivan ? // J.R. : Stick to the point , Tim , the only race we 're interested in is the Kentucky Derby . Right ? // T.T. : Right . // J.R. : O.K. Now let 's consider Silky the horse . SPORTS ILLUSTRATED sent its horse writer , Whitney Tower , out to the Coast to talk to him . I read about it last night , just before I hit the hay . Silky keeps a straight face and cocks that roving eye of his at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he ca n't seem to get into the race until every horse on the track and every human in the grandstand thinks he 's out of it . He even went so far as ... // T.T. : Did Mr. Tower talk to Willie Shoemaker , Silky 's jockey ? // J.R. : Do n't be silly , Tim . The Shoe ca n't talk  --  do n't interrupt me . Like I was saying , Silky went so far as to grab his chest and say , " Something in here seems to hurt me terrible after I get out of the gate and I have to slow down . " He 's got a brogue that makes old Doc Strub sound like Sir Cedric Hardwicke by comparison , but I 'm giving it to you in English . // T.T. : I get you , never mind how he talks . What you 're saying is that he hangs back until any horse with horse sense thinks he is out of the race . Then , when the likes of us well-bred horses are preparing a few words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our owners clasp hands willy-nilly and show their teeth , this crazy mick comes flying by roaring like a steam engine and takes the race . // J.R. : Exactly , Tim . Mrs. Markey and Jimmy Jones and all the people at Calumet must be proud of you . You 're a very perceptive horse . Now let 's hear a bright idea about how we can keep this western jerk from making us another pair of famous also-rans at Louisville . I do n't mind running second to the stewards , but , on my dam , I do n't want to run second to a horse . // T.T. : Do n't get personal , Jewelie . Silky Sullivan 's the problem before the horse  --  I mean , the house . Stick to the subject . // J.R. : Stick to the subject yourself , and give us the modus operandi for Louisville on Derby Day . Do n't forget , Silky 's trainer , who talks pretty good for a trainer , said : " The last time I saw Bill Corum I told him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse that would get me over there into his winner 's circle . " // T.T. : All right , here 's the m.o . We 'll break fast out of the gate just like Silky . Then you keep your eye on Silky and when he gets that expression on his face like he 's in pain and slows down , you wince like you 're in trouble and slow down with him . Or , better still , act like you really care about him and want to help him so you wo n't get your jockey accused by the stewards of pulling you up . // J.R. : Would n't that  --  // T.T. : Do n't interrupt my train of thought and I 'll guarantee you the next time you hear of Silky he 'll be playing a measly supporting role in one of those silly Westerns . All right , now Silky has slowed down to a canter and you 're right with him  --  solicitous as an old stable pony . Well , you could tell from Mr. Tower 's piece that Silky 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? No four-footed fellow creature ever cared enough about him before to slow down with him and offer to help . Here 's where you do it up big and we take the slob for sure . Ask him what you can do , and if he tries to wave you off , touch your chest and tell about the awful pains you have sometimes and how you get over them by walking for about a mile . Tell him that resuming his gallop would be about the worst thing he could do in his condition . // J.R. : Timmy old Tammy , you 're practically a genius . I wonder why those California horses could n't think of something like this . It 's breeding , that 's what it is , breeding . Why  --  hey , wait a minute  --  what will you be doing while I 'm holding Silky off ? // T.T. : Do n't be silly , Jewelie , the stewards would come right down off their perches if we both stayed back with Silky . I would n't want to get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // J.R. : Why you four-legged hypocrite , did you think of that all by yourself or did that two-legged son of Ben Jones put you up to  --  // Jewel 's Reward 's angry retort was interrupted at this point by the buzzer , which signaled the group in which the two horses were standing onto the track . Jewel 's Reward was mumbling some seemingly unprintable words as Tim Tam took off at a surprisingly rapid gait , ignoring the accustomed warmup trot . " It is my opinion , " said the pony to whom we are indebted for this horse-to-horse talk , " that the rivalry between East and East will be as hot as the rivalry between East and West on Derby Day .
