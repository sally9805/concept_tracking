Up for a vote in the U.N . Political Committee last week came two Russian resolutions aimed at the U.S. One accused the U.S. of " invading " Formosa . The other demanded condemnation of the U.S. for " bombing " Manchuria . Both were rejected overwhelmingly . Only the five Soviet bloc members voted for them . <P> Burma and Indonesia abstained from voting on the Formosa invasion resolution . Afghanistan followed suit on the Manchurian bombing charge . Only one other nation abstained . On both Russian complaints , Yugoslavia declined to stand up and be counted . It had also abstained earlier this month on the vote branding Red China for aggression in Korea . <P> Tito 's Yugoslavia is a likely target for Russian-inspired aggression in southeastern Europe .
