Art Baker , 58 , was born on the Bowery , where his mother ran a settlement house , and he grew up hoping to be a clergyman . But in World War I he discovered the compelling quality of his powerful voice when he was shifted from the front lines to the rear areas with orders to lead soldiers in community sings . Back in the States he toured the country as an evangelist until he reached California and became a lecturer at Hollywood 's Waugh-celebrated cemetery , Forest Lawn . <P> More than 5,000 graveside lectures gave Art 's voice the slightly unctuous quality that has made him one of the best-paid commercial announcers on the air ; he does the Chevrolet spiels on TV 's Dinah Shore Show and on a radio news cast . ( His grateful employers spent an estimated $4,000 building him a personal horn for his personal Chevvie ; it plays the commercial jingle : " See the U.S.A. in a Chevrolet . " ) He has also parlayed his voice into the radio program Art.Baker 's Notebook , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABC 's You Asked for It , depends less on Baker 's voice than on his nerves . A TV program aimed at showing its viewers whatever they want to see , You Asked for It has required Baker to stand still while a knife-thrower ringed his body with blades , an archer sent steel-tipped arrows whistling through balloons held close to his side , and a marksman shot the ace of spades out of his hand . He has been hoisted head-high by Ada Ash , billed as " the world 's strongest woman . " As his show last week was entering its sixth year for the same sponsor ( Skippy Peanut Butter ) , You Asked 's cameras interviewed the dietician for San Diego 's zoo , poked into an exhibition of whipcracking and sharpshooting , covered a test cracking of office safes and dived with Navy frogmen in action . <P> Letters from viewers pour in at a rate of 1,500 a week . " The kids ' requests show the effect of comic books , " says Baker sadly . " They 're always wanting horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles an hour . " An entire grade of Minneapolis schoolchildren wrote in asking to see Joan of Arc burned at the stake . There was only one dissenter in the class : he wanted to see a ship blow up in midocean . <P> Baker still has enough evangelistic faith to hope that his program is worthwhile . He says : " We 're not an educational show - you 're committing suicide if you try to be educational-but we do actually teach things . We never have a dirty show , never any innuendos , so any kid can watch us without harmful effects . "
