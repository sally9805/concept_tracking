Broadway these days seems a strait-laced street , solemn with young Method actors mooning over Chekhov and Freud , censored by Actors Equity , censured by critics . Little is heard to compare with the 19th century chores of young Edwin Booth , who led his father , Junius Brutus Booth , staggering from the corner saloon ; or Stella Campbell , who turned her back on Sir Beerbohm Tree so often that he ran screaming from the stage . But last week Broadway 's most spectacular feline feud in years had the whole street on edge . The clawing started when gifted Actress Kim ( Bus Stop ) Stanley abruptly announced her departure from Eugene O'Neill 's A Touch of the Poet . <P> " Mr. Portman 's behavior and frequent drunkenness , " said Kim , " have made it impossible to stay . " Everyone else 's immediate denials only produced exchanges worthy of the acid O'Neill script itself . <P> In Character ? Booze never bothered Eric Portman , said Kim 's understudy , Nancy Malone . " Like most British actors , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much , but he was never falling down or out of control . " Said Portman , who gives the leading man 's lines with a muffled Yorkshire accent : " The character himself is a drunk . He starts out a drunk , and he 's a drunk all the way through . I like to think that my behavior indicated this . " <P> Although Stanley 's steamer had not mentioned her at all , Helen Hayes , Broadway 's " First Lady , " who played Kim 's mother onstage , tried to lift her own skirts well clear . " We have worked together with the greatest understanding and sympathy , " said Actress Hayes . " I am an innocent bystander . " <P> This only reminded her friends of her constant complaints . " Portman was just a red herring , " said one Hayes intimate . " The trouble was between Kim and Helen . " Old Pro Hayes was sorely tried by the Method in Kim 's acting . " I do n't feel like being touched tonight , " said Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was played without a caress . Another time , Helen Hayes was quoted as saying , " I got two elbows down my throat from the girl . " <P> Virus Escape . Kim herself has been known to relax with a drink on occasion , but , said she : " Nobody has ever accused me of drunkenness on the stage . " A veteran of the " virus escape " in past shows ( Bus Stop , A Clearing in the Woods and the London production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof ) , Kim missed 31 Poet performances because of illness . But with Kim gone , the situation showed no signs of calming down . When her part was offered to Understudy Malone on a permanent basis , Nancy Malone asked for $500 a week . ( Kim Stanley had got at least $1,500 . ) Producer Whitehead offered her $450 ; Nancy quit in a huff ( the part will be taken by Actress Cloris Leachman ) . " It 's like having the moneychangers in the temple , " Nancy bitterly told a friend-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
