France is slowly but steadily losing her grip on her North African empire . Morocco has been in turmoil for a year . Until recently , nearby Tunisia was relatively quiet , but last spring nationalists began stirring in Tunisia . The nationalists were dissatisfied with the limited " reforms " offered by Resident General Pierre Voizard ; they were enraged by the moving of exiled Habib Bourguiba , the anti-Communist leader of Tunisia 's most powerful political group , the Neo-Destour <P> Party , to an island off the northwestern French coast and they took heart from French reverses in Indo-China and confusion in Paris . <P> Now a fanatic new group has entered the fight , giving promise of real trouble . <P> They are called fellagha ( pronounced fel-leg-a ) , which comes from the Arabic word meaning to cut or block , and reportedly traces back to the days when Arab bandits blocked roads and then descended on their victims . The fellagha , rising up in Tunisia 's rich but savage hinterland , so far number about 400 fighters , led by Lazhar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transient laborer . The French claim that the fellagha were trained across the border in Libya by former French prisoners of the Viet Minh , brainwashed by their Communist captors . The French also say that the Arab League , the Communists and the Neo-Destour are at work with the fellagha , though the independence-seeking Neo-Destour Party stoutly insists it disapproves of violence and excess . <P> Last week from the French stronghold of Le Kef , in the mountainous heart of fellagha country , TIME Correspondent Frank White cabled : Around Le Kef , French colons-colonial planters-were busy with their U.S.-made combines in waist-high grain , harvesting the best crop ( 56% above average ) in the province 's history . But the colons were not alone with their flailing combines . <P> Submerged in the rippling sea of tawny grain , there lurked a hidden menace . <P> There were fellagha in the grain . <P> I made the trip from Tunis to Le Kef in a car provided by the French resident general . The trip is made in the daytime only , over a road patrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government press officer handed me a German-made submachine gun wrapped in brown paper . To the driver who was taking me to Le Kef , I thought it only fair to explain that German arms were a little out of my line . " It 's all right , monsieur , " he said . " I drive so fast that by the time the fellagha get ready to shoot , we are far past them . " He seldom drove under 70 m.p.h . <P> " They Are Only Girls . " Two pro-French Arabs were recently caught by the fellagha . One had his tongue cut off ; the other was blinded in one eye with a lighted cigarette . On the morning of May 26 a family of colons named Bessede were surrounded in their isolated farmhouse . Two men of the family were shot down at the door , and the wife of one was raped . Two days later the same band of about 30 terrorists killed three more planters .                @ @ @ @ @
