Gobbler <P> Sir : <P> Do n't go on calling Russia 's peace campaign , phony TIME , Sept.11 , since it is n't . Russia sincerely wants to gobble up her neighbors peacefully . <P> <P> ERIC ARAGUARI Rio de Janeiro , Brazil <P> Red Blood , Pink Ink &; Ham <P> Sir : <P> <P> ... It is refreshing to see honest , positive and effective action taken against vicious and deadly Communist infiltration of our American Republic . Such sincere , upstanding , red-blooded Americans as Benjamin Schultz and his Joint Committee Against Communism , together with Theodore Kirkpatrick and Counterattack TIME , Sept.11 , certainly should make all of us proud-especially when they base their actions on the good old American principle that a person is guilty until he proves himself innocent . . . <P> The actions of these people suggest a positive action we could all take to rid this wonderful country of filthy Communism . Each loyal citizen joins together with about ten of his loyal friends to form a Committee of Confidence . Each Committee of Confidence assumes itself innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not Red tainted . <P> <P> JOHN E. SEVERSON Duarte , Calif . <P> Sir : <P> <P> . . . May I ask what is wrong with . . . the organization of a committee against Cornmunism ? The inconsistency of condemning Stalin 's actions and yet sympathizing with his friends and agents in this country . . . makes one wonder if there is n't a little pink mixed in with your printer 's ink . <P> <P> HELENE LILLIAN BOOTHE Woodhaven , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Your story . . . contained the statement that Mary Margaret McBride has been denounced in Counterattack . . . because she has endorsed Polish hams . . . <P> These hams are available in nearly every large food store in the Washington area , and sold as fast as they reach the counter . . . I suggest that our U.S. meat packers learn how to achieve that incomparable flavor . <P> <P> MRS . FRANK S. MORGAN <P> Arlington , Va . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations to Kirkpatrick , Schultz , el al. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are setting a noble example for all patriotic Americans , which I , for one , am going to follow . <P> The first on my personal black list is Robert Montgomery . He is a Republican , and next to Socialists , Baptists and jugglers , I hate Republicans . I have positive inside information that these dangerous subversives are trying to overthrow our Government . Giving up Mr. Montgomery is a considerable sacrifice , because he is a fine actor . . . <P> My two friends , who also hate Republicans , and I are oiling up our mimeograph . If 20 telegrams can get rid of Jean Muir , we can promise that six months from now our televisions will be darkened only by Democrats , and Democrats of the right race , color and religion . We hate lots of people besides Republicans . Some actors may deny our charges , but that wo n't help them . We do n't have to prove anything . All we have to do is write letters and telegrams and make telephone calls to sponsors . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poet 's Word <P> Sir :
