W HEN secret codes fail to express a military message adequately , someone must risk saying it in plain language . Near the close of World War II , a little tailor was confronted by his own equivalent of such a moment . He was fitting a hulking , world-famous admiral for a " victory " uniform . As the tailor measured , his helper made notes in an abbreviated tailor-shop code . " B-L one , " the tailor called . That , decoded , meant that the admiral was slightly bowlegged and should have his trousers cut to compensate . Then came the ticklish moment . The tailor surveyed the admiral 's paunch , a thing of Falstaffian proportions . Code terms proved utterly inadequate to describe its contour . So the tailor blurted , " Potbelly ! " There was a horrified silence . Probably never before in the history of the United States Navy had it been plainly stated that an admiral could be potbellied . Fortunately , the admiral was a big man inmore ways than one . To the great relief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment later the case of the potbellied admiral was a closed incident in the colorful 125-year business career of Jacob Reed 's Sons , America 's oldest uniform firm . Reed 's , with headquarters in Philadelphia , is the corporate personification of Siamese twins joined at the seat of the working breeches . Reed 's does an unusual twofold clothing business  --  at retail in civilian attire , and in factory lots of uniforms  --  through branches which work almost oblivious of each other . The retail establishment , in its five-story Chestnut Street Store , caters both to the price-conscious and to the wealthy who may buy $1600 worth of overcoats or $400 worth of sports shirts in a casual fifteen minutes ' shopping . The uniform-contract division , operating through its South Philadelphia factory and a sartorial outpost at Annapolis , Maryland , manufactures military raiment on an impressive scale and sometimes with a splendor calculated to dazzle the most blas ? parade-goer . Soldiers and sailors of a dozen nations have worn Reed products during more than a century of wars , and the firm has outfitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they were fuzzy-checked cadets or midshipmen . Many of Reed 's oldest and best uniform customers are in the South . This came about , casually enough , because Bill Nell disliked cold weather . Nell , a former cutter , quit the tailor shop some forty years ago to goon the road as the firm 's first uniform salesman . According to company legend , he asked , " Where shall I go ? " and was told , " Go wherever you can find business . " As it was . a bitter winter , he headed south . By the time he thawed out , Reed 's had made some lasting customers . These are dutifully cherished , for there are times every autumn when even the best uniform firm needs a friend . To solve the riddle of keeping the growing boy neatly uniformed , the firm long ago developed the nearest thing to an every-way-stretch garment . Drill and exercise flatten out youthful midriffs and broaden young chests so fast that a teen-ager may , in a single academic year , lose an inch at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprout up three inches in height . " Their center of gravity ' moves upward , " a Reed tailoring expert jokes , " so the uniforms have to be made adjustable to move with it . " To accomplish this feat , Reed tailors allow an extra inch of material along each coat seam and several inches at the bottom of trousers legs . A uniform made this way can be let out four full sizes as its young wearer grows . The answer to why it does n't wear to shreds meanwhile lies in the weight and quality of the cloth . Where a civilian winter suit may come in fourteen-ounce cloth , a recent order of trousers for West Pointers specified twenty-four-ounce material  --  virtually overcoat weight . Annapolis blues are seventeen-ounce and Army dress blues , in which Reed 's pioneered , are eighteen-ounce . Most military academies select eighteen-ounce coat material and twenty- to twenty-four-ounce trousers suiting for winter uniforms . The average cost is six dollars a yard , but the twenty-two-ounce blue stuff in Naval Academy overcoats costs eleven dollars a yard . Reed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Dan Hatch , Jr. , jovial general manager of the uniform factory , " after twenty years of wearing a coat of this material , officers have come back to us as admirals and asked that the coat be altered slightly , so that they could go on wearing it . " The designing of uniforms from these semiprecious fabrics is a precise science , presided over by Chief Designer Sam Gentile , a brisk , grayish , second-generation tailor whose beamy unmilitary figure would be the despair of any uniformer . Gentile starts by using " balance points " ? the points from which a uniform jacket takes its hang . He and his assistants trace and cut an original pattern in paper , then a master pattern in cardboard . Next comes a graded pattern showing the quarter-inch variations necessary for all sizes from a puerile twenty-six to a deep-chested forty-six . Sample uniforms are then made up , dressed on dummies , and studied with the critical eye of a general inspecting a rival army 's honor guard . " The main thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulder points . Those and the waist points have to be in exact relationship down to a fraction of an inch . Otherwise the uniform will wrinkle atop the shoulders and behave badly elsewhere . Formerly we designed a uniform to fit everywhere , working out each place point by point . Now we take a tip from the ladies . We start by letting the cloth drape down from the shoulders . It makes a more natural , yet perfectly military style . " The uniform executives feel they took a great forward stride recently when they persuaded their best customer , the Naval Academy , to adopt a smarter , more modern blue blouse . " The Naval Academy was sticking to its old style , with narrower shoulders and a higher collar line than almost any other men 's clothing , " Gentile explains . " We showed them several designs with wider shoulders and lower collars . Finally they agreed . What did we tell them ? " Gentile laughs . " Maybe we told them how good the new Air Force uniform looks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far back as the cocked-hatted days of 1852 , acquired the entire lucrative contract for the Naval Academy in 1902 . It has treasured it ever since , as the Academy spends well up in six figures annually to keep its young gentlemen nattily attired . In rendering the superservice exacted by the contract , Reed 's maintains a full-time Annapolis staff of nine , including seven expert tailors and fitters . Much of the intricate hand sewing in Reed 's sprawling South Philadelphia factory is done in manufacturing Naval Academy uniforms . Where lapel linings of ready-made jackets are machine-stitched in a few minutes , each midshipman 's lapels are hand-sewn at the rate of one a half hour . Foreman Joe Tretta , a five-foot Napoleon of the coat-and-pants business , explains volubly to all comers that a hand stitcher can shape a lapel so that it will always lie back naturally , whereas the soulless machines lack this art . Tretta , frankly a partisan of hand tailoring , holds to the same dogma on buttonholes . The ten hand-sewn ones in Naval Academy overcoats take sixty-five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To insure the smartness which is a hallmark of United States Navy midsbipmen the world over , Reed tailors patiently hand-stitch approximately 46,000 buttonholes and 9200 lapels a year . Wont in mil on Pug .. 78 ) The great annual production rush of the uniform trade strikes Reed 's between September fifth and twentieth . More than fifty college ROTC units and military schools with a total enrollment exceeding 15,000 " mobilize " then , and demand new Reed uniforms by reveille next morning or as soon after as possible . From long experience , the firm has its strategy all worked out . Where contracts specify " made-tomeasure , " task forces of fitters take the field with tape and chalk . Measure blanks include cryptic characters which stand for long neck , short neck , sway back , flat or full chest , very erect , stooping , head forward , flat seat , and the like . A B-L-two customer is only moderately bowlegged , but a B-Lthree is very much so . Trousers seams are adjusted accordingly . When ready-made uniforms are authorized by contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the September deadline . In anticipating such needs , it has developed " experience tables " based on each school 's previous orders . One school 's sartorial past can not be applied to another because of variations which would baffle an anthropologist , let alone a tailor . The experience tables reveal that the teen-age American male towers to a maximum in Minnesota , where many are six feet or more , and nearly all are spare and lean . The heftiest lads are usually in New England military institutions . Man for man , they outweigh Southern cadets of approximately the same ages by five to ten pounds . " Perhaps this represents better insulation against the weather , " as one Reed executive puts it . The largest hat sizes are found in Wisconsin and points west . Reed 's politely declines to theorize why . The Reed uniform clientele , far from halting with military cadets , takes in everyone from brigadiers to bellhops . One of its catalogues formerly touted a smart bellhop outfit as being " the West Point cadet style . " Fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point patronage . Other customers include whole generations of bands , from John Philip Sousa 's to the Array oompah experts who played for President Truman 's inauguration last year ; socialite military companies with colonial traditions and uniform styles ; veterans ' units , fire and police forces , uniformed railroaders of some of the leading lines , and industrial-plant guards . The firm provided uniforms for the entire United States Marine Corps from 1845 to 1876 . Its individual uniform customers have ranged literally from dwarfs to giants . Reed 's designed snappy , brass-buttoned outfits for a pair of midgets whose stunts promote beer , and a tent-sized blue-and-red uniform for an ungainly seven-footer who acts as doorman and walking advertisement for a typewriter company . Part of the Reed success in the uniform field comes from knowing when to retreat . When a small Federal agency recently asked for bids on garments for its handful of uniformed employees , Reed 's made a routine request for specifications  --  and was snowed under by a made-in-Washington avalanche of paper . " The specifications for uniforms for thirty men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-five pages . We did not choose to bid . " Lately , Reed 's has soared into the wide blue yonder of the uniform trade by manufacturing the new Air Force blue garb not only for service personnel but for college ROTC units at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Lehigh , Purdue , Michigan State , Penn State , the universities of Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Akron and others . It also produces uniforms , mostly in cadet gray , summer khaki and a gamut of blue shades , for the Citadel ; Clemson College , with its ROTC corps of 3000 ; the small but select Princeton University ROTC unit , which goes in for officers ' green coats and " pink " slacks ; and such chesty military academies as Peekskill , Manlius , Black Fox , Northwestern , New York , Borden-town , Gulf Coast , Riverside , Porter , Bolles and Missouri Military Academy . Most cadet uniforms are machine tailored at an annual cost of $125 to $500 per capita , according to the number and variety of outfits required , but hand-tailored uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hand-sewn uniforms from West Point , New York Military Academy and elsewhere have gravitated increasingly to Reed 's because the firm has one of the nation 's last sizable aggregations of bushelmen ? master tailors who can make any part or all of a garment by hand in an age of machine specialists . The Reed experts , all European-born and apprenticed at twelve or thereabouts , now average sixty-one years of age . But theirgnarled features glow with physical durability and an almost fanatical devotion to an employer who has always paid them good , steady wages . The bushelmen , among the relatively few in tailoring establishments who draw a guaranteed weekly wage , are covered by contract with Local 110 , United Garment Workers of America , AFL . The local , an aristocrat among unions , can trace its ancestry back almost as far as a Daughter of the American Revolution . It is directlydescended from the Sons of Adam , an organization of Philadelphia clothing cutters which later became the Knights of Labor and , in 1897 , the present AFL affiliate . Old Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1833 , while the humbling influence of his own tailoring apprenticeship was still strong upon him . The agreement was entirely oral . " In those days , " says George Pohlsen , business agent of Local 110 , " union and employer had complete faith in each other 's word . Even today , we can say that in a hundred and sixteen years we have never had a strike or a lockout . " Jacob Reed , the founder to whom the twentieth-century union agent refers so eulogistically , knew little of labor movements and less of uniforms when he left his birthplace at Liberty-town , Maryland , to be apprenticed at the age of ten to a tailor uncle in Philadelphia . The War of 1812 was still raging , so his parents bundled him into a northbound farm wagon with a prayer that he " never sees a uniform on the way . " Their prayer was answered . After eleven years as p needle-andthread apprentice , young Reed opened his own little shop on " tailors ' row " at 246 High Street , near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting the pioneer times , lists " Muskrat hat , ten dollars . " Reed 's success sprang from two master strokes of merchandising about the time of the Mexican War . With other tailors haggling for the highest prices the trade would bear , he boldly ' announced a " one-price " policy based on cost-plus and inflexibly iblyun ) 28 orb.serv.1e9 : Only thus , he advertised , could customers be assured of quality ? an.d Reed , though he did not mention ft : of a fixed margin of profit . His sevens sales strategy was based on his observation that , in a nation burning to reach new frontiers , a large part of the male population was pushing frowzd ) beyond reach of custom tailors . So he concentrated on manufacturing ready-made clothes " expressly for Southern and Western markets . " Soon he owned a four-story wholesale and retail house at Fifth and Market streets . At the outbreak of the Civil War , ' ' mere matter of buttons led to guar ' cions concerning Reed 's loyalty to the Union . A native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied uniforms for Richmond , Charleston and other Southern militia companies prior to 1860 . Left with a e stock of useless Southern buttons ; he thriftily sewed some on his sons school suits . His boys were badgered as " little rebels , " and there were rumor " that a mob might wreck his store . The mob failed to materialize , however , when Reed 's three spinster sisters ' emulating the fabled Betsy Ross , sewed together what was described as " the largest United States flag ever seen in Philadelphia " and Reed proudly hoisted it over his store . Soon afterward , Reed and his needle brigade spiked all question of loyalty forever by uniforming the first three Philadelphia regimentsto march against the Confederacy . The firm outfitted the Sixth Regiment , First Pennsylvania Volunteers , from colonel to drummer boys , in what is still considered record time . Not only did Reed garb the 1400 soldiers in thirteen days , h ' dressed them in some leftover cadet gray which was soon to be known as " Confederate gray , " and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons to enter the business , Reed retired in 1877 , although for years thereafter he would stalk through the tailor shop , apostolic beard flowing , pince-nez perched on his nose , uttering his favorite exclamation , " Great times ! " and pausing to dip snuff with the silk-hatted head cutter or some other dignitary of the tailoring trade . During this period the Reed family suffered its first business casualty " in line of duty . " Cramp 's shipyard in Philadelphia was constructing , almost side by side , warships for rival use in the Russo-Turkish War . With tape-measured impartiality , Jacob Reed 's Sons outfitted bewhiskered Slays and dark-bearded Turks in the latest naval apparel for doing each other to death in style . A single slip might have started a miniature war in Philadelphia 's back yard . Actually the only casualty was Reed 's son Alan " He spent the night aboard a visiting Russian ship and came home bitten from head to foot , " a nephew recalls . " Presumably this may now be mentioned without international repercussions , as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depreciated sharply in 1883 as a result of speculation , domestic holders began to unload it at eighty-five cents . A financial panic swept Philadelphia on Saturday , June thirtieth . The next day , in the middle of the Sunday sermon , Edward Reed got an idea . He darted out of the church , got his two brothers , and suggested that it would be smart business to accept trade dollars at one hundred cents . The brothers agreed . Bright and early on Monday , Jacob Reed 's Sons announced with a flourish in a Philadelphia Times ad that they would welcome trade dollars at par , giving full value in merchandise . In the same issue the newspaper commented editorially that if dealers accepted the trade dollar , " it must mean that they give only eighty-five cents ' worth of goods . " The editorial added facetiously that the quickest way to get rid of unwanted dollars was to bet them on the Philadelphia baseball team  --  a suggestion which many have found remarkably valid through the years . The Reeds instantly regarded the editorial as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball team . They switched their advertising to the rival Evening Telegraph and proclaimed : " We jumped into the breach . . . we stemmed the panic , which , if allowed to take its course , would have involved countless losses . " An appreciative public saw to it that their business boomed . In the midst of these " great times , " as he loved " to call them , old Jacob Reed finally came to his deathbed in 1890 at the age of eighty-seven . As his eight surviving children and numerous grandchildren gathered tearfully around , a faint twinkle appeared on the dying man 's face . He indicated that he wanted to speak . The solemn group leaned forward to hear his last words . Lifting his head , he said " Boo , " and expired with a chuckle . He would have enjoyed this war , " his head cutter and old crony is said to have remarked at the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898 . Reed 's was in it literally from start to finish . When the Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabled for others . And when the Spanish fleet steamed out of Santiago de Cuba to its doom in a grand finale of naval gunfire , one thing close to the pounding heart of the American commander in chief , Rear Admiral Williazn T. Sampson , was a Reed-uniform label . During 1917-18 , Reed 's did more than three million dollars ' worth of tailoring on uniform materials furnished by the Army , in addition to a de-luxe retail business in Sam Browne belts , swagger sticks , overseas caps and puttees . In the acrimonious postwar debate over " Who won the war ? " Irving L. Wilson , who rose from a three-dollara-week shipping clerk to head the firm through two wars and two depressions , demonstrated his versatility by tangling in rhyme with Rudyard Kipling , poet , of the British Empire . Ina twenty-line poem , The Vineyard , Kipling decried the American soldiers ' belated entry into the war . Wilson championed the troops his firm had uniformed . Using the same meter as Kipling , he wrote a twenty-two-line rejoinder which ended : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fully healed ? if , indeed , it ever existed ? to such an extent that uniform-division sales are now handled largely by an affable Englishman , Guy Brigg , a World War I British officer , director in a swank Piccadilly leather firm and grandson of the leather merchant who supplied Queen Victoria with side saddles and riding crops . During World War II , with Brigg speaking " French to the French , English to the English , American to the Americans , and relying on sign language with others when necessary , " the uniform division of Reed 's manufactured nearly 1,000,000 overcoats , blouses , trousers and battle jackets for the United States Army while the company 's retail military department sold more than $2,000,000 worth of assorted uniforms and accessories to American , British , French , Dutch , Norwegian , Chinese and Brazilian officers . Reed 's diplomacy was tested by orders to uniform hundreds of Chinese naval officers sent to Miami , New York , Philadelphia , New London and Boston for special training . The first to arrive were one war behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choke-collared and braided blouses worn by United States officers in 1917-18 . Reed 's , tailoring frantically to measurements which averaged four sizes smaller than American ones , tactfully converted the Chinese to current styles . Without budging from their work benches , Reed tailors found themselves spanning the globe in war wear : Tight-waisted blue jackets for dapper French submariners ; heavy duffel coats fastened with wooden pegs for British naval personnel operating above the Arctic Circle , where the icy clutch of metal buttons tears flesh from fingers , and tropical-weight battle jackets for a victorious return to Manila . At one hectic point , the firm was taking orders by telephone for batches of 25,000 Army trousers . Anyone familiar with the Government 's usual " signed , sealed and delivered " contract procedure can recognize how radically red tape was slashed . The order finally climbed to 100,000 pairs . Reed executives scrambled to line up a half-dozen capable subcontractors . Irving Wilson Gloninger , then vice-president in charge of the uniform-contract division , rushed to a nearby town with an assistant and helped to unload Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four A.M. Suddenly and alarmingly , a subcontractor who proved reliable in World War I failed to meet World War II specifications . The Army fumed and investigated . Gloninger and his uncle , Irving Wilson , president of the firm , happened to be dining together that Saturday night . Both dashed from the table at the first phone call and conferred with quartermasters and inspectors until three A.M. on Sunday . The elderly Wilson remarked almost gleefully , " This is like being in the FBI , is n't it ? " The pants investigation finally proved that the subcontractor had , among other things , skimped material in cutting . Reed 's , which prides itself on making good , saw to it that the entire 100,000 pairs of breeches were amply big . In World War II , as in previous wars , the Reeds and their executives have never hesitated to don uniforms themselves when eligible for service . The tradition goes back to the Civil War , when two of Jacob Reed 's older sons served in the Union Army . The present secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the founder , flew on antisubmarine searches around the Azores as a Marine Corps aviator in World War I. His son , Edward , came of age to enter the Army on August 14 , 1945 , just in time to draw one of the plush-jest postwar assignments imaginable ? manager of an American soldiers ' night club in occupied Vienna . Returning home , he started behind the tie counter and is now on his way up from the clothing-store ranks as the family 's fourth-generation representative in the business . The executive setup which directs both civilian and military branches of the business is studded with veterans and affords an example of " unified command " which Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson might well envy . At its head as chairman of the board is E. H. Molthan , a brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve who married one of Jacob Reed 's granddaughters . The uniform-factory manager , Dan Hatch , Jr. , a Dartmouth College administrator before the war , served on General Molthan 's staff in the Pacific and then went into business with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. J. Hesketh , a World War II Navy veteran in his early forties . The firm 's personnel manager , D. B. Konover , saw service as an Army major , and its advertising manager , Barclay Ewing , was a Navy lieutenant . These men and their colleagues run a business whose gross sales top $5,000 , - 000 a year . On a peacetime footing , the uniform transactions amount to approximately $1,500,000 annually . Five other companies , in New York , Philadelphia and Cincinnati , exceed this figure , but that does not appear to disturb Reed 's . With current civilian sales above $3,500,000 a year , the store is prepared to ride snugly to both its anchors if economic storms blow . The uniform branch feels depressions last and least , as its basic materials and styles are less subject to individual whims and current clothing fads . Even so , the civilian trade , in everything from evening tail coats to special apparel for clergymen and schoolboys , has a reputation for bearing up well under financial stress . For its more elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executives ' Shopping Service . " Whenever an executive imagines he is the least bit frayed , his secretary need only mention " shirts , " or " suits , " or " ties " on the telephone . The service keeps a card index of individual sizes , color and style preferences and quantities desired ? usually by the dozen , if shirts or accessories . Come what may , this is hardly a clientele likely to be caught going around in barrels . While the store is prepared to outfit males between the ages of four and ninety-four from head to foot for any occasion , it sells absolutely nothing for females of any age . Yet many of its patrons are women shopping for their menfolk . They get a gracious reception , tempered by the realization that they are in a man 's world . Only four of the sixty-five salespeople are women , all in one boys ' department where customers often come very small and accompanied by mamma . This department , on the third floor , also boasts the only ladies ' room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemanly thing by calling attention to it with an extra-large sign . The sales force  --  average service , twenty years  --  is regarded as Reed 's most potent weapon in the highly competitive retail field . In four major departments , salesmen are paid entirely on commission . An ace salesman 's income and accounts are trade secrets , but a good man in a good year has been known to work himself nicely up into the five-figure income bracket . This is made easier by the fact that ready-made suits at Reed 's , for example , ram to a top price of $135 , and custom-tailored ones , starting at that figure , ascend as high as $225 . In giving special service to regular patrons , the firm at times damns expense like Farragut damning torpedoes . " Frankly , we spoil our customers , " one executive admits . Some of the foibles that the store indulges are truly fantastic . During the recent war , when the inferior rubber in garters quickly lost its elasticity , one steady customer 's fifty-cent pair wore out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he marched in and got a new pair free . This kept up twice a month for a year . Then he was gently reminded that the prewar life of normal garters was only a year . He deposited another fifty cents . . . and bought $400 worth of other merchandise . Another customer , annoyed by the wartime irregularities of the laundries , bought a fresh detachable collar every morning for nearly two years and daily tossed the soiled one across the counter with the cavalier request , " Send it to my home . " Reed 's obliged . The firm 's customer relations have been even more intimate at times . A rotund gentleman who purchased great quantities of woolen abdominal belts in three weights , light , medium and heavy , found his life plagued by deciding which weight to wear . Reed 's helped him install a thermometer outside his bedroom window and work out a thermal scale for selecting the right belt for the weather . In another instance , a young lady buying gloves for her fiance could n't remember his glove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salesman , " by holding your hand the way I hold his . " In the presence of witnesses , they held hands . The sales force kowtows in a truly regal welcome to customers like the fast-traveling corporation executive who purchases everything in triplicate , one set for each of his homes in Florida , Pennsylvania and New England , so he wo n't have to load himself down with baggage . He recently bought thirty-six identical sports shirts , total $432 , to have a dozen in each home . In the same splendiferous class is a manufacturer who buys three dozen pairs of special flannel slacks at a time and delights the luggage salesmen by ordering an individual suitcase for each of his many suits . For consistency , Reed 's cites the steel man who , when raccoon-skin coats were in vogue , selected a $650 number . It was stolen from the vestibule of his home that night . The next morning he came back , bought another $650 coonskin coat and also a $1000 beaver coat that struck his fancy . Reed executives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not expect all customers to buy lavishly . Some , like the man who asked Salesman Harry Cline for a leather necktie , have n't bought at all . Cline could n't oblige in plain leather , but suggested something nice in a genuine snakeskin tie at ten dollars . The man departed , declaring that he wanted no snake , , not even a dead one , around his neck . As a rule , however , the firm 's patient coddling of customers has been richly rewarded . Salesman Lawrence Fichter , who has kept a personal sales record since 1899 , figures that he alone has sold $2,225,000 worth of goods . His customers , including Woodrow Wilson , bought 617,000 shirts from him . " I could have sold more , " he says wistfully , " except that the store ran clean out of shirts during the last war . Had four thousand unfilled shirt orders , and , boy , was it embarrassing ! Not a shirt to our name ! "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
