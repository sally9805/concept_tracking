The reading primer ( " Easy little steps for muddy little feet " ) is completely Mad : " My teacher is Miss Furd . I tell the school board Miss Furd is a Commie . Miss Furd is through in this town . . . This is Bobby Smith . He is our playmate . Bobby sells reefers to the other children in school . " <P> Through such zany mockery of the solemn , the pretentious and the inane , the bimonthly Mad is compiling a growth chart that is no laughing matter . For its sixth-anniversary number out last week , Mad printed 1,300,000 copies , a 100% increase in a year . What is more , Mad is solidly in the black though it carries not a line of advertising , has spent only $350 on outright promotion . In fact , the essence of Mad 's success is its nimble spoofing of promotions of all kinds . In its parodies of advertisements and travel stickers , vending machines and lovelorn columnists , Mad is a refreshingly impudent reaction against all the slick stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its visible and hidden persuaders . <P> For its anniversary issue , Mad conjures up magazines like Caveman 's Weekly ( sample article : " Is the Stone-Axe the Ultimate Weapon ? " ) and the Pilgrim 's Home Journal ( " I Should 've Kept My Big Mouth Shut , " by John Alden ) , gives advice on how to play golf ( " The grip should be about the same as one would use clutching a dead trout " ) , and quotes some woman-meets-native dialogue from the National Osographic : " Evelyn stepped forward and asked in Swahili , ' What I want to know , and I want you to give me a straight answer to , is-I mean-I want to know if you really got cannibals up this way . I mean I heard the rumble . I know the story . ' " <P> " What-Me Worry ? " Most fascinating aspect of Mad 's success is that its spoofs appeal mainly to teenagers . They bombard Mad 's tiny editorial offices just below Manhattan 's Greenwich Village with some 400 fan letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of Mad 's grinning imp Alfred E. ( " What-me worry ? " ) Neuman , and treasure old issues like collector 's items . Maddiction also has become a cult in some adult circles . Comics Ernie Kevacs , Bob and Ray , Henry Morgan and Orson Bean contribute frequently and willingly for next to nothing . <P> Publisher William M. Gaines , a hearty , hefty man of 250 Ibs. , launched Mad in 1952 as a sideline to the comic-book business he inherited from his father , M. ( for Max ) C. Gaines , who started the whole industry in the early 30s when he hit on the idea of selling reprinted newspaper comic sections for a dime . Using the standard comic formula-32 pages , newsprint , four colors , a 10 price tag-Mad was just holding its own when Gaines played a hunch in 1955 , switched to semi-slick paper and higher quality black-and-white drawings , upped the price to 25 and promptly had a boffo success . The magazine now clears $43,000 an issue . <P> Mad 's booming popularity astonishes Publisher Gaines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain it is something glib like , ' Everyone is under a strain , and some sort of comic relief is a good thing . " If we knew exactly what we were doing right , we 'd do more of it . "
