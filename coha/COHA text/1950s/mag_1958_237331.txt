The Sputnik Syndrome is characterized by whirling satellites before the eyes , by alternating periods of deepest gloom and wildest premonitions of impending doom , and by the steadfast conviction that the U.S. , helplessly and hopelessly , is falling behind the U.S.S.R. in military technology . Since last Oct. 4 , when Russia 's Sputnik I spun into the sky , the syndrome has afflicted many who should know better . Proclaimed Columnist Joseph Alsop three weeks ago : " It is now the Eisenhower Administration 's policy to permit the Kremlin to gain an overwhelming superiority of nuclear striking power in the next five years . " Wrote retired Army Lieut . General James M. Gavin in his book War and Peace in the Space Age ( TIME , Aug. 11 ) : " We are in second place militarily and in second place in the exploration of space . " The syndrome had one of its most remarkable manifestations last fortnight , when Massachusetts ' Democratic Senator John F. Kennedy arose on the Senate floor to say : " Once the Soviets are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic strategy we employ . The classic strategy is that of the underdog-and soon we will be the underdog . " <P> Last week came one of the first serious attempts to treat the Sputnik Syndrome . In a Senate speech Massachusetts ' Republican Senator Leverett Saltonstall prescribed equal doses of common sense and facts . Far from wallowing in the Soviet technological wake , said he , the U.S. has made historic progress . Items : &gt; The intermediate-range ballistic missile Thor has been put into production , and the intercontinental ballistic missile Atlas has been successfully tested at full power . <P> &gt; The nuclear submarines Nautilus and Skate have made epochal explorations beneath the ice pack of the North Pole . <P> &gt; Mobile forces , deployed around the world on 24-hr , alert , are backed up by the world 's most modern manned bombers ; atomic weapons have increased the striking power of U.S. military forces a thousandfold . <P> &gt; Three U.S. space satellites have gone into orbit with better scientific instrumentation than the U.S.S.R. 's Sputniks . <P> " Is this lack of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior member of the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee chaired by Texas Democrat Lyndon Johnson . " Does this indicate that we are headed for second best in 1960 or 1964 ? So let us not sell ourselves short ... There is a great deal of difference between making a judgment based on estimates of what we think the Soviets are doing and making a judgment based on what we know we are doing . . . We shall never be the underdog if we keep on the job . "
