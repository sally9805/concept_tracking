txt Decision on the validity of gasoline price rises in four eastern Massachusetts counties may now come either from the courts or from the Legislature . Possibility of the court test loomed in the case of an Everett dealer who had refused to corn-ply with the price-fixing act . The Legislature also has before it a repealer bill filed by the Massachusetts Division of the American Automobile Association . The dealer . Clifton F. Lord , of Lord 's Esso Service Station , has declared the price-fixing law to be unconstitutional . While he has received several telephone threats , he said , he also has had many expressions of approval for his stand . Meantime , he has stuck to his cut prices and manned his pumps under police guard , despite the earlier orders to raise prices from the office of John P. , director of the Division of Standards and the Division of the Necessaries of Life of the State Department of Labor and Industries . Swiss Cheese Act ' In defying the law , Mr. Lord has the AAA 's endorsement and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test . The AAA has denounced the law as " a scheme " under which motorists are being " made the goats to guarantee a profit for gasoline dealers . The organization refers to the law as the " Swiss cheese act " ? " it is so full of holes . " Meanwhile , George E. Thompson , District Attorney of Middlesex County , under whose jurisdiction a court test might evolve , said today he had received " no direct complaints , " but that investigation was being continued , and " any violator will be prosecuted . " He added that the case of Mr. Lord , and his alleged violation of the law , had been brought to his attention . The Everett Police Department had conducted an investigation at his request , he said , and two officers reported to him today , and will continue their probe . 5.9-Cent Markup The law , which was passed in 1950 , and which became effective only yesterday , after five years , in Suffolk , Norfolk , Essex , and Middlesex Counties . requires dealers to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale prices . Purpose of the so-called " below cost act " was to end price cutting among gasoline dealers in certain areas north of Boston , where price wars have raged for years . However , to become effective , the law had to have the approval of at least 30 per cent of the gasoline dealers in the area covered . According to the office of Mr. , which sent letters to more than 4,100 dealers , about 40 per cent of those in the four counties had reached the agreement on the price markup  --  five years after the law had been passed . The law is not effective in other Massachusetts counties . Price Wars Hit Frederick H. Moore , executive secretary of the Retail Gasoline Dealers Association of Massachusetts , declared that the law is " definitely not a price-fixing measure . It was put into effect to stop unfair discrimination , unfair methods of competition , and destructive trade practices . " Disastrous price wars , " he said , " have cut gasoline dealers ' profits by as much as $10 to $30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline dealers in the area to go out of business within the past two years . " The reason the law was not put into effect before this was due to freezing of prices for two years by the Office of Price Stabilization . But , in 1953 , price wars started , and have continued . The law was drawn up to protect small dealers , and to keep them from going into bankruptcy , Mr. Moore stated . " Whereas other businesses operate on a profit of 25 to 40 per cent , the gasoline dealers , even with the 5.9-cent markup , make only about 8 per cent profit . " Out of this 5.9 cent cost of operation , dealers must pay their rentals or taxes , along with employee wages , insurance , Social Security taxes , workmen 's compensation , and their light bills . " ' Motorist Penalized ' Robert S. Kretschmar , manager of the Massachusetts Division of the AAA , said that his organization , representing some 50,000 motorists in the Greater Boston area , is " unalterably " opposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soak the motoring public with a 26 per cent jump in the retail price of gasoline , " he said . " There is no valid justification for making the motorist pay this penalty . " I am told the law was passed to kill gasoline price wars . It fails of its purpose ; in fact , it invites them . " The AAA also said that the price rise can work a hardship on dealers operating stations near the New Hampshire border and in other nearby counties , outside the four where the law is now effective .
