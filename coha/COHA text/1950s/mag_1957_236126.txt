&lt;J At an age ( two years ) when he should have enjoyed the bounding prime of youth , a Utah beagle 's muzzle was grey , his bones brittle , his joints creaky . Reason : since puppyhood , he had received regular injections of radioactive isotopes at the University of Utah 's Beagleville ( TIME , Dec. 27 , 1954 ) . Radiobiologists guessed that constant exposure to internal radiation somehow diminished the beagle 's natural resistance to stress , accelerating the aging process . Further studies of radioactive beagles may provide clues to the nature of the aging process in man , suggest ways to impede it . <P> t Doctors are learning to control phenyl-pyruvic oligophrenia , a brain-crippling disease of infants caused by the body 's failure to assimilate a protein called phenylalanine . University of Minnesota nutritionists report the case of a one-year-old boy in whom a diet of enriched and predigested milk protein , plus fruits and vegetables , arrested the disease . &lt;jj One of medicine 's poorer risks is the patient with a damaged heart muscle who suffers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Hospital have devised a way of using a heart-lung machine to help selected cardiac repeaters survive the critical first six to eight hours . The heart-lung machine , previously used mainly in heart surgery to provide the surgeon with a dry field , takes blood from the leg vein of a patient , infuses oxygen , filters out bubbles in a pad of steel wool and returns the blood under pressure into an arm artery . By thus handling the circulation of about one-third of the body 's blood supply , the machine sometimes relieves an ailing heart muscle of enough of its load to keep it going . In the first two cardiac cases so treated at Kings County , one got " dramatic relief , " a second " less-striking improvement .
