" Freedom under law is like the air we breathe , " wrote President Dwight Eisenhower as he prepared his speech celebrating the first U.S. Law Day this week . " People take it for granted and are unaware of it-until they are deprived of it . The clearest way to show what the rule of law means to us in everyday life is to recall what has happened where there is no rule of law1 . The dread knock on the door in the middle of the night . . . " <P> May Day , U.S.S.R. , in the land of that knock , was to be another sort of day . From the marble tomb of Lenin and Stalin , in the shadow of the Kremlin walls , traditionally comes a dictator 's propaganda of arms and marching men-with a rattle of rockets in the background . <P> Between May Day , U.S.S.R. , and May Day , U.S.A. , lies the difference between those who use laws as instruments for force and those who believe in the force of law to bring order and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outlaw and the lawful . To emphasize that difference , to provide an occasion for national rededication to the rule of law , the President proclaimed : <P> WHEREAS our Government has served as an inspiration and a beacon light for oppressed peoples of the world seeking freedom , justice and equality for the individual under laws , and <P> WHEREAS universal application of the principle of the rule of law in the settlement of international disputes would greatly enhance the cause of a just and enduring peace , and <P> WHEREAS a day of dedication to the principle of government under laws would afford us an opportunity better to understand and appreciate the manifold virtues of such a government and to focus the attention of the world upon them : <P> NOW , THEREFORE , I , DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER , President of the United States of America , do hereby designate Thursday , May 1 , 1958 , as Law Day .
