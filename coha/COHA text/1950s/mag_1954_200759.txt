Of all the nation 's first families , none has witnessed more of U.S. history than the Adamses . But for more than a century , scholars have had to wait for the entire collection ( 300,000 pages ) of Adams papers to be opened . Last week , in cooperation with the Massachusetts Historical <P> Society and Harvard University , the trustees of the collection-Vice President Thomas B. Adams of the Sheraton Corporation and John Quincy Adams of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company-announced that the big day had come . With a ten-year gift of $250,000 from LIFE , a group of historians will edit the papers for the Harvard University Press , will also make them available in microfilm to 16 U.S. libraries . Among the items in the collection : the complete diaries of Presidents John and John Quincy and Diplomat Charles Francis ; letters and manuscripts of Historians Brooks and Henry ; family correspondence with everyone from George Washington and Abraham Lincoln to the Duke of Wellington .               @ @ @ @ @ @
