In the past 20 years , industrial designers have become a self-conscious coterie , well paid and well content with their mission : to save mankind from ugliness in man-made products . The work of such men as Henry Dreyfuss , Ward Bennett and Raymond Loewy in Manhattan and Eero Saarinen ( who is both architect and designer ) in Detroit has raised industrial design from a mechanical slough of vulgarity . For in the early years of mass production , the sound design of artisans gave way to the cheaply pretentious . The craftsmanlike simplicity of early American furniture was displaced by curlicues and overstuffing , and bathtubs took on lion feet in a move to look ancient . <P> Yet good design has always been good and can not be dated . Though the myth of stylistic obsolescence keeps dress and car manufacturers in business , it remains a myth . This basic truth was thoroughly documented in last week 's retrospective show of designed products at Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art . Among the many chairs , for example , in the Modern Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , designer anonymous , manufactured back in 1860 . And yet that ancient rocker , tendriled like a vine from the wine-heavy hills around Vienna , had a brisk , bald-bottomed rival in Charles Eames 's up-to-the-minute en try in molded Fiberglas and wire . An art nouveau desk ( circa 1903 ) by Hector Guimard that looked as sinuous as weeds under water held its place against a rigorously rectilinear chair by Le Corbusier . <P> The museum 's collection , said Design Department Director Arthur Drexler , " includes very few of those mass-produced objects supposed to be characteristic o ; our ' high standard of living . ' There are no television sets , no refrigerators , no telephones , not because such objects are intrinsically unworthy but rather because their design seldom rises above the vulgarity of today 's high-pressure salesmanship . " <P> With eleven products in the museum 's haughtily thoughtful collection , and four in the show itself , Designer Charles Eames dominated the scene . The great Finn , Eliel Saarinen ( Eero 's father ) , took <P> Eames under his wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from then on Eames climbed a ladder of his own designing , as tall as the one which he keeps in his own living room so that , on impulse , he can hang something new from a ceiling , or rearrange objects on a wall . <P> At 51 , Eames argues soberly that " to the designer , the chair provides an area where he can follow through with an architectural concept and test it directly in terms of human scale and function . " But the man whose chairs stand in over 1,000,000 homes unabashedly admires the old along with the new , perches himself on a stub-legged Indian chair in the house he designed for himself in Venice , Calif . His dining room ( background is furnished with his prize-winning 1944 chair . And , his black leather chair near by frankly owes a great deal to the Victorian functionalist , William Morris . The leather cushions have built-in wrinkles , Eames concedes , " but that is a clue that spells comfort to come , like a well-used first-baseman 's mitt. "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
