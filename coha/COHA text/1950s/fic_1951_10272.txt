Sebasti and Reali the rest of them began to look at him with glances that could kill ; he half expected to find one of them trying to stick a stiletto into his back . He was leaving the - banking house late one afternoon after one of those oft repeated conversations with the younger Grandi , whose Tuscan was so polished it offered not a word of commitment to hold on to , when he was startled to hear his name pronounced behind him on the street . The voice sounded like a woman 's . " Please Mr. Bradford . " When he swung around he found himself being addressed by a youth in a shabby black velvet jacket , who had a little of the look of one of the models who waited for painters at the foot of the Spanish Stairs . The youth gave him a slippery Luini smile , whispered " Antico Caffe Greco " and set off down the street , rolling his hips as he walked . Thinking of the hermaphrodites of the Augustan period he had catalogued by the hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and highly embarrassed by the thought of being seen following such an androgynouscreature , Eliot stalked warily after him into a dark in-nerroom of the cramped little cafe . He wished he had remembered to carry his sword cane . " Capisce Italiano ? " " Capisco , " said Eliot tartly as they sat down . The creature said his name was Dino and launched into an account of his poverty , his artistic leanings , the illness of his mother , the sum of money he needed for his sister who wanted to become a nun . Oh he just wants money , Eliot thought with relief . His embarrassment left him . For a moment he thought . ; Dino might be the count , but no the count was his amico . Quante lire signore would a personal introduction to his excellencybe worth ? Eliot explained at some length that the dilettanti americani he represented would naturally want to express their gratitude to His Excellency 's friends once the purchase was completed and the fragments were safely on shipboardfor New York or Boston . Dino narrowed his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sprawling youth madep151Eliot , who sat bolt upright as far away as he could get on the seat , feel quite itchy . They drove past the Pantheon and through deep narrow streets to the Tiber and across a sunny bridge into a tangle of lanes in Trastevere that smelt of damp stucco and rancid olive oil . Eliot was beginning to fear he was being led into a trap when the cab stopped under an arch in the entrance to a courtyard full of flowers and sun . He gave Dino a couple of coins to pay the cabman and let him keep the change . They walked up flight after flight of dirty marble stairs with a rail carved with putti and garlands in gray sandstone and were met at the top by the yapping of a black and tan . A strapping young woman in peasant dress ran out on the landingto hush the dog . Dino brushed past her and ushered Eliot out onto a terrace under vines where in a cheap wicker chaise longue lay Count Barbareschi . If Dino was the hermaphrodite the count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a human figure that expressed such depravity . It was a delicate sensuous face in the style of Filippino Lippi that dissipationhad begun to bloat into the coarse semblance of a Negro . Immediately the bargaining began . The count shrilled out in querulous falsetto that the Grandi had been keeping buyers away for their own purposes . The girl , evidently his mistress , whose name was Francesca and whose upper lip bore more than a touch of a mustache , joined in with shrill cries that the Grandi were ladroni . There appeared a barefoot friar with remarkably large and soiled great toes who joined in the discussion . Everybody shouted at once . The Grandi were hounding him to his death , cried the count . They were the architects of his ruin , he shrieked . Eliot tried to impress on him that perhaps if His Excellency would authorize him to deal with the Grandi , they could be induced to see reason . But he must be allowed to retire to consult with his dilettanti . The friar padded after him down the stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any littlep152gift the dilettanti americani intended for her would be safer if placed in his hands . As Eliot was leaving the palazzo an old man with a portfolio seized hold of both his lapels , asked if he were not it millionario americano and immediately launched into a complicated plan for getting the fragments out of the country through Naples in a box of Venetian mosaics . It must be Naples because his cousin was in the customhouse there and could expedite the authorization . Ile was the father of the lovely Francesca . She had a sister , he added rubbing his hands , while his face took on a most repulsive leer , who was a virgin . " No thank you , " said Eliot . When Eliot got back to the hotel he took a bath and changed his linen . At dinner he told a somewhat bowdlerized version of the story , to Tattie and to her halfbrother Marmaduke Ames , a lanky young man with a long sandy mustache , on leave from one of those English regiments of horseguards where everybody had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a ripping adventure . . . Boccaccio , eh what ? " and he said he had better go along as a bodyguard for the next interview . Marmadukewas a great help during the remaining course of the intrigue . He understood no word of Italian , but he stood behind Eliot and twirled his mustache and stared people in the face in a most disconcerting way . They both carried swordcanes the night when after the Grandi had been paid off , a first installment was delivered to the count , and the fragment , in four packing cases , was placed in their hands for shipment to Naples . Eliot and Marmaduke , their faces muffled in cloaks against the miasmas of the campagna , kept watch all night on the cart until the freight office at the railroad station opened at sunrise amid the crowing of all the cocks and the squalling of the babies in the adjacent tenements . Taking full advantage of their license as mad Englishthey rode clear to Naples in the baggage car , dazzling the brakeman with largesse and sending him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were endless . The cus/toms officials , the captain of the port , the prefect of police and minor officials without number had to be bribed to assure the shipment on a British steamer bound for the port of Boston of this remarkable collection of modern mosaic . The stevedores seemed to sprout as many outstretched hands as Hindu divinities . Every palm had to be crossed . Even after the packing cases were deposited on board Eliot had to lift the lids for a last time , to make sure that there had been no sleight of hand , before making the final payment to the agents of the count . When at last they left the frieze safe under the protection of a Scotch supercargo and of the Union Jack , they drove in triumph to the station and climbed aboard the wagon-lit of the night express . Tattie met them at the station in Rome with the baggage . The three of them had a very jolly journey , though they felt some apprehension as to what action the Italian government might take if the departure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modane they drank a bottle of champagne and toasted the master of Praxiteles . They then proceeded to spend a week beside a cool Swiss lake before returning to Asolo to pick up the children . After the successful conclusion of this adventure Marmaduke , who came to look on archaeology as a sport like pigstickingor the shooting of grouse , spent as many furloughs as he could wangle as Eliot 's partner in excavations that took them to Cyprus , to the Fayum , to Cyrenaica . He became remarkablygood at negotiating for permits with the Turks . Arabs respected him to a man . As British intelligence became more and more appreciative of Captain Ames ' laconic reports he spent less and less time with his regiment . In the ruins of Palmyra , while Eliot was choking in the dust of his excavation in a corner of Zenobia 's palace , Marmaduke hunted gazelles on the desert and managed to flush a brace of German engineersdisguised as Druses , who were surveying an alternative mute for the Baghdad-Balm .

The news of Belgium 's invasion and the declaration of war sent Marmaduke hurrying back to England . It was his death in one of the first holding engagements in a beetfield in Flanders that first brought the full pain of war home to the Bradfords . They heard the news in their suite at the Crillon in Paris where they had reached their wit 's end in daylong arguments with Eliot 's mother , who insisted she was quite strong enough to serve as a trained nurse on the battlefield , while they tried to convince her that it was her duty  --  and a post of honor and danger at that  --  to escort her grandchildren and their nurse home to Hingham . When she finally consented to take passage on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring . " I 'll make poor dear Peabody care for the children next summer . " As soon as the family had been safely installed aboard the liner they returned to Paris . Tattie joined the British Red Cross and Eliot , with a reckless energy and an organizing skill he had been developing as he grew older in his archaeological projects , threw himself into creating a volunteerambulance service for the French , whose plans for care of the wounded had advanced not a whit since the Franco-PrussianWar . The first time he drove , in a converted Rolls Royce he had furnished himself , a load of muddy bandaged piouxpiouxthrough the deep ruts of a shellpitted road from the lines to the quiet and the soothing smell of disinfectants of a field hospital , he felt a profound satisfaction both in the fact that he was not afraid of shellfire and in the fact that he was helping , while his own country in callous stupidity stood cravenly aloof , to defend civilization from the onslaught of ap155barbarian horde . He became so absorbed in the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of Athena from Umm-es-Salaam had been lost at sea in the torpedoing of the steamer Coptic . After Louvain and Rheims , and so many brave men dead , the wreck of another tiny fragment of the precarious beauty France and England were bleeding themselves to protect from the hammerblows of the Hun seemed sad but irrelevant . He would have exchanged the head gladly , he thought , as he went over the figures of expenses and donations at his desk in the Paris office , for half a dozen wellequipped motor ambulances.  |p156LURCHING  with the green baize bookbag over his shoulder , out of the hateful Cambridge April day into Mooney 's Pleasure Palace 's close cabbageflavored vestibule , jay Pignatelli saw in the grime of Mooney 's mirror forever cracked his name reversedon a telegram . He never remembered tearing the yellow envelope ; immediately the message spread across his hand YOURFATHER PASSED PEACEFULLY AWAY AT 4.30 A.M. THIS MORNING YOUR PRESENCE URGENT IN CHICAGO . . . LUKE . He saw CousinLuke 's noseglasses with gold rims like Dandy 's , the adamsapplefidgeting under the sallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the horseshoe pin that sparkled in the Bond Street necktie , the raised eyebrows topping a smooth hairless face that was a meager shaven snapshotof Dandy 's face . Dandy was dead . Dandy your father is dead , it said ill Jay 's head as he stuffed shirts into Dandy 's passed on portmanteau . I lived in Dandy 's world like in his old portmanteau . So much to say that now never can be said . . . Toothbrush . Socks . Coat . Hat . " So much unsaid , " he said aloud as he hefted the portmanteau . He could barely lift it , it bulged so with hooks . All the way to Harvard Square , he had to lug the scuffed portmanteau , his coat flapping in the knucklechapping Cambridge wind , mashed brown hat pulled down over eyes that skimmed the sidewalk for fear of seeing some face that was familiar , before his handp157could grasp the cold handle of a taxi door . He had no words to use for a familiar face . As the cab trundled him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confusedcrowds along the curb while the letters of the telegram like soldiers marching strode stiffbacked past YOUR FATHER which art in heaven PASSED PEACEFULLY .. . ... Peace is past ; at every streetcorner headline over headlineclamored war . HOUSE IS READY TO PASS WAR MEASURES . . . READY TO DIE FOR LIBERTY MAYOR DECLARES . . . And Dandy 's voice in the library at Wharton Place while with a small smile on the big lips under his mustache he fed squares of raw steak to Diogenes the black snake in the bowl and Jay , a smaller skinny squirming Jay . listened , tonguetied , inattentive , constrained but listened . " If we can seize what we are beginning to call the psychological moment to unite the Englishspeaking peoples in a league for peace there need be no wars . Call it a league for war if you prefer that name , so long as it becomes a league of the likeminded . Any powerful league would make for peace . The great forces of international finance are already more than half convinced that peace is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech and the Common Law have enough political education to set up institutions to enforcethe peace . To do that we must unify . . . Jay , if I said this outside my own library I should be crucified . ' We must meet the Britishers halfway . To a certain extent we must repeal the Declaration of Independence . " ( It was like the man without a country ; it was like saying Damn the United States , Jay thought . ) " You 're shocked . " Dandy laughed . " It even shocks Diogenes the old cynic living in his tub who I am sure is an upright patriotic snake . New ideas give people pain and must lie whispered very carefully in the ears of snakes and small boys in the privacy of the library . The question is how to state the necessary new ideas so that people will give them consideration . If we could form an Englishspeaking league thisp158century that you Jay , not I , will live to see , would be the greatest in human history . " The century that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in front of him as the cab poked into the packed traffic that churned the thin slick of mud in the towpaths of the Boston streets under the flags , the curling stripes , the staring stars that so stirred his blood . Less danger of fans i l iar faces in the Boston streets .

THIS MORNING . MY PRESENCEURGENT IN CHICAGO to discover the century that I shall live to see . . . What the devil would he find to say to Luke ? Once in the South Station he felt easier . It was the place he liked best in Boston . ( A railroad station is your only home , thought Jay . ) After he had paid the taxi and wired Luke he had just enough money left for an upper on the nocoach train . He had hours to wait . It made him feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pocket watching people passing to and fro , with strange faces he did n't have to speak to , until suddenly grief , the grief he had felt for Petite Mere , welled up in him and like ink poured into water filled the bright world with black . Dead . Tears blinded his eyes . He had to clamp his lips tight with his teeth to hold the sobs . He pulled a volume of the old brown Gibbon out of his bag : In the last days of Pope Eugenius the Fourth , two of his servants , the learned Foggiaa.s and a friend , ascended the CapitolineHill , reposed themselves among the ruins of columns and temples , and viewed from that commanding spot the wide and various prospect of desolalion . The place and the object gave ample scope for moralizing on the vicissitudes of fortune , which spares neither man nor the proudest of his works , which buries empires and cities in a common grave .. . Long before the time came for the train to be made up Jay found he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other on a slab of stale chocolate out of a slot machine and then swinging the bookbulging old portmanteau he walked through the gate into the foggy gusts off the Grand Banks that mingled with the choky coalsmoke of the trainshedand climbed aboard his sleeper , where the yawning pullmanporter settled him into the plush and stuffy steamheat of his reservation . He sat with his hands in his empty pockets noting with aloof interest the proprietory air with which the other passengers occupied their seats . There were women with babies and roundfaced businessmen , a whitewhiskered old gentleman with polished luggage who looked like a Boston banker , matrons in furcoats , but nobody young enough to talk to . Jay had a couple of Gibbons , Napoleon the Last Phase , a yellowbackedCasanova and a blue Turgeniev piled on the seat beside him but he was so out of patience waiting for the train to leave that his eyes could n't seem to stay on the rails of print . When the train started , breathlessly he was telling himself , he 'd leave his useless old self standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasoned and tough , alert to lay hold on life , would go rumbling towards Chicago , towards the century that he would live to see . As the train slid smoothly out of the station a small canvas covered trunk appeared swaying above Jay 's head . Jay ducked and pulled in his feet as the occupant of the lower berth popped from behind the bulky Negro porter like a jack out of his box . He was an army captain , signal corps , a small alert ramrodstiff personage in a hurberry with a camelshair overcoatover his arm and a number of polished leather cases of various sizes hung from his Sam Browne belt . He settled himself on the edge of the seat opposite jay , bouncing up and down a little with the motion of the train as if he were made of springs inside . He wore steelrimmed spectacles and had his ( lark hair cropped like a shoebrush . His short mustache bristleddangerously at the tips . Not a man to trifle with it seemed to say.  |p160Jay  found a pair of black eyes probing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisp voice . " Lawschool , " said Jay . " So was I. College and lawschool . . . How do you come to be reading Gibbon ? " " I find him soothing in times of stress . " " When I went through lawschool they did n't leave you any time for extracurricular reading . . . I thought the law was a bloody bore . " " May I ask you a question sir ? " drawled Jay in his smoothest tones . " I notice you are wearing glasses . . . I 've been trying to get in the army . I 've tried everything in Boston and Cambridge . They tell me I 'm too myopic . . . They even told me I had flat feet which is a base libel . The only people who 'd even put my name down were the ambulance service . That does n't seem very . . . very active . How did you do it ? " " Plattsburgh ? " asked the captain , picking up his imquisitorial manner again . " To tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to compressmy education into the minimum . " " I understand , " the captain said in a sarcastic tone , " that they are graduating men who join the service without exam-inations . " " It 's not entirely that . I 'm through this spring anyway . " " Law Review ? " " Not quite . " Jay blushed . That failure stung . " Perhaps the question was out of order , sir . " " Not at all . Want to make the world safe for democracy , eh ? Well , there 's a little thing known as a waiver . " " May I ask how you go about getting a waiver ? " The captain did n't answer . The train had reached Trinity Place . He was looking intently out the window . " How lovely , " he whispered dreamily . " What ankles . . . Damnation she 's not taking the train . " The engine huffed and puffed . Vestibule floors banged asp161the train began to pull out of die dark station . " We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unusual on this train . " He turned back to Jay and looked him up and down . " Since our fair one has deserted us perhaps you 'll eat dinner with me . You 'll tell me about lawschool and I 'll tell you about the real significance of Gibbon , or Turgeniev if you had rather . " He gave a short huffy laugh . " Within a month I expect to he diningat Turgeniev 's table at the Cafe de Paris . " " On the avenue de l'Opera where he used to have conversations with a certain countrygentleman from Normandy . " " You speak French ? I took you for an Englishman but you pronounce French too well for an Englishman . . . Perhaps we had better introduce ourselves . Captain Bronson . . . F. Scott Bronson . " He thrust out a small knotty hand . Jay shook it . " Jay Pignatelli , " he muttered indistinctly . " Glad to meet you CaptainBronson . " " I know that name . I used to know a Mrs. Pignatelli with two browneyed daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said jay . The words seemed to cut his tongue as he said them . " Hum , " said Captain Bronson . He looked out of the window . Jay 's eyes followed his and studied the rows of threedeckerframe houses of the Boston suburbs . " Would n't be much of a life , would it ? " said Captain Bronson . Then he turned back and looked Jay in the face . " You 'll get a commissionif you really want one , " he said . " How 's your mem-ory ? " " Pretty fair . " " It 's not too hard to memorize an eye chart . " " I speak a couple of languages that might be useful over there , " said Jay hesitantly . Captain Bronson stuck out his chest . " The language of command is the only language an officer needs . " " If we get to sending troops we 'll need interpreters . "  | " There 's no ' if any more . We should have been in a year ago if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now . If the people of this country had n't lost all stamina .. . If you let people step on your toes it is n't long before they are kicking you in the face . " Captain Bronson all at once looked at Jay so hard Jay began to blush . " You must be Jim Pignatelli'sson . . . The famous Jim Pignatelli . . . I heard him in court several times before I went into the diplomatic service . " " He died this morning , " said Jay . " My my , " said Captain Bronson in a surprisingly gentle tone . He began to busy himself with the bristle of his mustache . " Gibbon is good for that , " he went on softly . . . " I have a theory about Gibbon . . . The sense of the grandeur of history , sentences like majestic colonnades . . . I used to have a whole lecture on Gibbon when I was on the Chautauqua circuit .. . Gad it- used to be hot in those tents . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Jay said to himself and felt gatefut . " An added reason for going to the war . Nothing to hold me , " Jay insisted . " Just : keep trying , " said Captain Bronson . " In my experienceinterpreters are cringing miserable creatures . I have a theory that they invariably mislead you . . . You can do better than that . You get your waiver . Tell me how do you like his chapter on Justinian ? " ' They talked Gibbon and Roman law until the colored man in a white coat went through announcing first call for dinner . Jay held back when the captain told him to come along , getting very flushed until he finally confessed lie did n't have a red cent in his pocket . The captain laughed . " Well that makes my presence providential . . . I like to feel providential . " All at once they were friends . The captain talked and Jay listened and ate his head off and drank half a bottle of wine and it was n't until he climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a stone in his chest.  |p163Jay  woke late . When he came back from shaving in the empty smokingroom the porter handed him a note from CaptainBronson who had left the train at Cleveland giving him a phone number to call in Chicago . As Jay did n't have any money for breakfast he sat looking sullenly out at the barns and the factories and the endless ranks of dry cornstalks marching across the level furrowed fields still scabbed with stale snow all too familiar in the haze of the April thaw . He fell to reading Turgeniev 's Smoke and could hardly tear his eyes from the page when the porter came through with his whiskbroom . Jay did n't have a quarter to give him and was still debating with himself whether he ought to have taken his address to mail him one while he dragged the unwieldy portmanteau down the platform at the Chicage depot . " What you got in there , gold bricks ? " growled a voice in his ear as a hand snatched his bag away from him . Bill Keezer shuffling along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache hanging in a limp frazzle over his mouth that Jay hardly recognized him . ( It 's not the dead , thought Jay , it 's the living who suffer death . ) " Gosh Bill let me take it . . . It 's books . You know I ca n't do without books , like a drug addict . " Bill Keezer clung resolutely to the portmanteau . An incomprehensiblegrowl came out from under his mustache . " Bill , " said Jay , " loan me some money for breakfast . I just had enough for the ticket . " Bill 's glum face pulled itself together into something like a grin . His back straightened . He rummaged in his wallet with his free hand and pulled out a ten dollar bill . " Take this Jay , " he said . " You kin have more if you need it . Right up to the hilt ... There 's many a time the boss has dug into my savin 's when he ran low , and he always paid it back with interest , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Jay .

Your Cousin Luke and Mr. Mortlake are waitin ' for you . " " First , " said Jay feeling the strength coming into him from every word Bill Keezer said , " I 'm going to eat my breakfast .. . We 've got a tough day ahead . " " The girls wired Mr. Mortlake their power of attorney from Pasadena . Him and Luke are waitin ' to read the will . . . It seems there are pressin ' matters . The boss 's creditors were closin ' in all these last weeks . Bill , ' he says to me , if I get out of this I 'll never borrow another dollar . ' We were fightin ' with our backs to the wall . " " All the more reason for a good breakfast . " " The boss did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an empty stomach . " Jay led the way into the acreage of tables spread with starched tableclothes and shining silver of the station restaurant . Bill Keezer followed after humbly carrying the port-manteau. - " You better have something yourself , Bill , " said Jay . " I ca n't eat , " said Bill . " I 'll smoke my pipe . " Jay ordered up fruit and cereal and liver and bacon . " The boss , " said Bill Keener in a critical growl , " never et a breakfast without two softboiled eggs . " " And two softboiled eggs , " said Jay smiling up at the waiter 's congenial black face . Driving , his belly warm with breakfast , through slambanging streets past hurried sidewalks in a cold gray wind to the Merchants ' Building , the words , " the learned Poggius urgent in Chicago , " kept circling round inside Jay 's head . The place and the object gave ample scope for moralizing on the vicissitudes of fortune , which spares neither man nor the proudest of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . Going up in the elevator Jay with dread remembered the portrait , the insolent gloss , the highlights in the eyes . Hep165would n't look at it . Gibbon was good for that . When a glumfacednew elevator man , not the jolly one Jay knew , opened the door into the dark lobby of the offices of Pignatelli and Miller , the first thing Jay felt was the emptiness . There was no receptionist at the desk . The light over the portrait was out . Its outlines were dim . It was like Sunday . His throat stiffened as he pushed his way without looking to the right or left through the groundglass door into the brightness of Dandy 's private office . Empty , he thought . Then he noticed Joe Mortlake 's tall dark longjawed countenance , topped by dark hair parted in the middle , rising up out of one of the brass studded leather armchairs . He looked the perfect undertaker . Pale as its own ghost Luke 's face , eyebrows aloft , mooned over Dandy 's desk . " Your train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying in his prosecuting attorney 's voice as he fluttered a white hand over the bluecovered documents that littered the desk . His solitaire diamond blinked in the sullen light that came in through the broad windows off hurrying April clouds . " Sit down Jay and give us your concentrated attention , if you can . Much of what you are about to hear will be unfamiliar to you . " The way Luke pronounced his words , the pauses between his sentences , his gestures , the cut of his clothes were a maddeningparody of Dandy . ( I could wring his neck , thought Jay . ) " To be brutally frank we have to go to work fast to avoid being pushed into bankruptcy . Your father 's major asset was his partnership . He has as you will note left his interest in the firm , if it can ever be evaluated "  --  Luke threw in sarcastically  --  " to you and to your two halfsisters in equal parts . I 'm sure it is no news to you that before he died he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his estate he has appointed you and Mortlake and me . Between the estate and the firm we can , if we are n't careful , get into enough litigation to keep the courts busy for years and land us all in the poorhouse.  |p166There  are some rather complicated provisions by which you are supposed to take your father 's place in the firm when your legal standing and ability shall justify this step , ' " Luke quoted in a high jeering voice . As Luke reached to pick up another bluecoated document , Jay noticed that he 'd already had a broad band of crape sewn on the sleeve of his green serge coat . Luke gave a short dry laugh . " I have taken the liberty of perusing the will . " ( You would , thought Jay . ) " Your father my dear boy , like many a good lawyer before him , has I fear written a very had will . We must set about to remedy its deficiencies . " As Luke cleared his throat respectfully his heavily starched cuffs shot out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men by these presents that I James Knox Polk Pignatelli , " he began to read , " being of sound mind and in robust health , " ( Boasting again , thought Jay . ) . . . For the life of him he coud n't keep his mind on what he was listening to ... " That a state of war between the United States and the Imperial German government is formally declared . . . " Urgent in Chicago the learned Poggius reclined among the broken columns of the Capitoline and looked over the ruins of Rome . . . " Rome , " Dandy used to explain . " What we need most in this country is an understanding of history . Jay you must go to Rome before you can understand the greatness and the curse of empire . " It was no longer Dandy 's voice . It was his own he heard iii his ears . And Caesar bent the world to his will . How did lie go about it ? Detail . A thousand daily actions , inflections of the voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tablets , the language of command established the Roman Empire for Gibbon to describe and it declined and fell until the learned Poggius found nothing but old stones propping up pigpens and rubbishpiles pasturing goats . " Jay are you following me ? " shrilled Luke giving Jay a con/temptuous look as he let the document fall out of his hand . " Surely your studies at Harvard lawschool have given you some intimation of the traps and pitfalls with which such a document is filled . We shall need your signature on the petition to probate . Furthermore Mortlake and I have prepared a series of papers which I am sure you will consider it in your best interest to sign . Although the office is closed in token of mourning we have asked Miss O'Higgins , who , as you may remember , is a notary public , to stand by . " Mortlake suddenly chimed in with his heavy booming voice . " Your halfsisters have assented in principle . " " You will execute , my dear Jay , " Luke 's voice was flutily persuasive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keezer to take any necessary steps to protect the interests of the firm , and yours of course . The instrument must be couched in the broadest terms . " " That 's very foresighted of you Luke , " said Jay , " to think of a power of attorney . I happen to be trying to get into the army in the worst way . " " We expected as much , " said Mortlake heartily . " No slackers in our family , " said Luke . Inside himself Jay felt all at once very bitterly amused . " Suppose I stayed on in Chicago ? " he asked . " The Selective Service Bill will surely pass , " Luke tittered . " It will be war without stint , " intoned Mortlake . " I envy you , Jay . The young men of America have a rendezvous with destiny . " " It 's going to take all the pull you two 've got " said Jay and burst out laughing , " to get me into Uncle Sam 's army . " Luke frowned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of attorney , " he said ; " because among the real assets are some tolerably large blocks of stocks . The market fluctuates .

We are all going to have to work for our living . " " I 'll need a waiver , " said Jay , " to get in the war at all .. . on account of my eyesight .

" " In my opinion , " went on Luke , letting the solitaire diamond flash in a ray of sunlight that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days will see a phenomenal rise in values . A rise of ten points on the board in Consolidated Electric will be enough to enable us to wipe out a substantial part of our indebtedness . " He pushed the cuffs back into his sleeves and reached for the pushbutton on the corner of the desk . " Your dear father , Jay , was a very poor bill collector . He would never allow Mortlake or me to dun his clients . There are thousands of dollars in outstanding accounts that we can collectif we have a little time . . . Come in , Miss O'Higgins . " Luke 's voice assumed a formal courtroom tone . " No matter how heavy our hearts in this sad moment we must proceed in the spirit of mutual confidence ... As the English say we must carry on . " Miss O'Higgins gave a sniff as she tiptoed toward the corner of the desk . She was a dry little woman with gray hair tied in a knot behind . When jay got to his feet she gave him a mournfulbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at Bill Keezer . It seemed to Jay for a fraction of a second that Bill was shaking his head just a little from side to side as if to say do n't . Jay signed the first set of papers . and a second and a third as Luke laid them reverently before him blotting each signaturewith pursed lips as if he were going to kiss it . When hep169came to the power of attorney to Bill Keezer Jay paused with his pen in the air . Someone had come into the room behind him . He turned guiltily feeling suddenly ashamed of being caught in this group of men crouched like conspirators round the blue and white documents . A stocky dark stubblefaced man in blue denims stood in the door . He had a set of black belts looped round his waist . He carried a bucket . A smell of sweat and soapy water came from him . " Where de boss ? He no sick ? Big boss no sick ? " " Do n't you read the papers , Nick ? " Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No read , " said the stubblefaced man . " Nick , " said Mortlake , choosing his words carefully as if trying to explain something very difficult to a child , " the big boss is no more . " " Pneumonia . He passed peacefully away , " intoned Luke , " at four thirty yesterday morning . The stubblefaced man 's face was contorted with the effort to understand . " Dead , " said Mortlake with a boom like a cannon shot . The stubblefaced man dropped to his knees beside his bucket and made the sign of the cross with two thick fingers . When he got to his feet tears were running down his face . " Boss my frien ' , my fader . . . I love him , " he said , gropingblindly for his bucket . " Every Sat'day tirty years I washa de window . " " There there , " said Mortlake . " We are all very much shaken . Better let the windows go until next week . " Miss O'Higgins took Nick gingerly by the sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If there 's anything I hate , " said Luke , " It 's a vulgar display of emotion . . . By the way , you 'll have to let us sell Wharton Place . " " The girls have already consented , " Mortlake rumbled . ( If there 's anything I hate , thought Jay , it 's Luke 's damnp170supercilious face . ) He laid the pen down beside the inkwell . " I do n't really need to sign the power of attorney , Luke , " he said in his pleasantest voice , " until I actually leave Chicago . Now do I , Mr. Mortlake ? Since I 'll be right here to execute any instrument that is needed . " " Of course if you assent in principle , " said Lukehuffily . As Miss O'Higgins filled in the notary 's forms and slipped each paper into her shiny stamp Bill Keener , making a little humming noise in his throat was stacking them in even piles on the desk . " That 's all , Miss O'Higgins , " said Luke yawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " said Mortlake . " Bill will you close up . " Miss O'Higgins drew in her breath suddenly looking very pale . " When , " she asked in a choking voice , " will the funeral be ? " " Tuesday at Wharton Place at eleven , and no flowers please , " said Luke still yawning . " Lord I need sonic sleep . " Miss O'Higgins hurried out sobbing into her handkerchief . " Now Joe , " said Luke briskly . " Let 's see what we can do to further the patriotic designs of our budding hero . " He reached for the phone . Jay had begun to walk up and down in front of the windows . He had to get out of this office . He had to get out of Chicago . If he did n't get out of this office he 'd break down and cry , he 'd haul off and sock Luke in the jaw , he 'd make a vulgar display of emotion . " All right Jay , " said Luke coming up behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are o0 . General Coates is bringing a man down to the club who is recruiting for the Judge Advocate 's corps . . . The time will come Jay , " said Luke severely as he pulled on his gray suede gloves , " when you will realize that we have your best interests at heart . " " By the way , " said Jay . " I 've got to have some dough , Luke , just to tide me over . My Cambridge bank account is darn dry . How can we arrange that ? "  | " Right at present , " said Luke in sugary tones , " the simplest thing will be for me to make you a personal loan . . . How about a thousand ? Bill , where did I put those forms ? " Bill Keezer with glum face and glazed eyes came back from another office with the printed form for a note of hand . " It 's all made out . . . a demand note at eight per cent interest . I never get less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortages in Texas . All you need do is sign here . " Luke indicatedthe line with the little finger of his gloved hand , " and Joe , " he added with a mischievous little smile , " will endorse it , wo n't you Joe ? We all know Jay 's good for it , but just to have everything businesslike . . . " Luke yawned again . Jay signed , and Joe Mortlake with a protesting pout on his lips turned the note over and wrote his name on the back . " Now the banks are closed . Would you like a check or cash ? How much cash have you got in the safe , Bill ? " Jay said he 'd take twenty-five dollars and leave the rest in the safe . He paid hack ten to Bill Keezer , shook his hand , and followed Luke and Mortlake to the elevator . " I 've engaged you a room at the Palmer House , " Luke was saying . " May and Augusta are arriving from Pasadena tonight and their aunts are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies occupy Wharton Place . " Stuffing down lunch with the partners and round and ramblingGeneral Coates . who never got to the end of the story about hunting- a bear with T.R. on an Arizona ranch , and sharpnosedCaptain Kendrick who said very little , amid the cigarsmokeand foodsmell and the packed faces and hunched backs squeezed between the dark oak panels of the Saturday Club , each minute seemed to drag an hour , but once jay and Captain Kendrick got away from the lingering luncheon stories , in spite of Saturday afternoon and the wind whirling through the streets and the empty offices and the dead steamheat in deserted corridors , the captain , who came from a small town in Ohio and aspired to he an actuary and had every confidence in the President , turned out to he a man of action . With fewp172words and many phonecalls he dug out a sleepy major , in an office that was suposed to be closed and a sergeant with a pad of purple ink and a desk full of application blanks and mimeographedforms for affidavits to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before he knew it , found himself  --  physicalexamination  --  lying on a cot the iodoformreeking office of a certain Dr. Lyman who leaned over with dangling stethoscope and knocked on his chest and took his bloodpressureand shyly demanded a little urine in a bottle . Shirt , coat and necktie hung on his arm , Jay was left alone in a long narrowroom with an oblong card of brightlight black letters at the other end . Holding his breath he tiptoed up to the board and studied the smallest black letters . If only the three littlest lines would stay in his head . " Without your glasses , now , " said Dr. Lyman tiptoeing into the room from the back . Jay 's heart jumped as he recited . " Nothing wrong with you , young man , " growled Dr. Lyman , peeping with a tiny flashlight in his pupils . " Your eyes are better than I thought . One of these days you 'll throw away your glasses . " " I 'd sure like to , " whisperedJay blushing crimson as he guiltily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necktie he 'd dropped . Recommend a waiver . Captain Kendrick and Dr. Lyman tilted their heads together as if to start singing a duet . We recommend a waiver . Jay could see the waiver overhead like the stars and stripes rippling in an artificial breeze against a blue cyclorama while all the audience cheered . More forms to be filled , but then the sentence : " The waiver has to come from Washington , " that stopped the vicissitudes dead and left him desperately stranded in the lobby of the Palmer House with nothing to do but wait and Sunday to face and grief and what to say to May and Augusta who had never quite liked to admit that Jay existed at all and their aunts he did n't know and a quarrel with Luke to avoid and the funeral Tuesday . He went up to his room and lay clown on the bed and piled volumes of Gibbon around him and read and read and read.  |p173Smelling  sour of newsprint from great piles of papers and close with steamheat the hotel Sunday dragged . Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law school and Professor Bangs and tried to make it all seem funny to Fred Wallace whom he begged to get his things out of Mooney 's Pleasure Palace and expressed to Chicago . In the afternoon he went to a vaudeville show but he could n't keep his mind on the spectral figures yelling ragtime out of the spotlight 's tremulous ring and went back to his room to read more Gibbon . The satirical historian has not blushed to describe the naked scenes which Theodora was not ashamed to exhibit in the theatre . After exhausting the arts of sensual pleasure , she most ungratefullymurmured against the parsimony of nature : but her murmurs , her pleasures , and her arts must be veiled in the obscurity of a learned language . Monday morning he woke up early and over the morning paper in the diningroom remembered the phone number CaptainBronson had left him . When he dug the slip of paper out of his wallet he found the number was the number of the Palmer House . Although it was n't quite eight yet he called the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precise voice was answering on the phone . " If you have n't had breakfast yet come up . General McCleod 's coming in the door right now . " Jay headed for the room as last as the elevator would take him . It was the drawingroom of a suite with salmoncolored hangings . A waiter was pushing in a table set with coffeepots and iced grapefruit and jingling waterglasses . The general was a gray man with carefully chiselled gray features . " This will be our last taste of civilian life for some time , " he was saying as he watched the waiter deftly snatching the silver cover off a large dish of scrambled eggs . " Jay , " said Scott Bronson who was treating Jay as if they 'd known each other all their lives . " I know anything we sayp174wo n't go any further than this room . . . The enemy has ears in all the walls . How are you getting along with your com-mission ? " Jay told the tale of his vicissitudes much as he had written it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general was studying him carefully . " Good enough , " Scott broke in . " I lave you ordered your uniforms yet ? " Jay got red in the lace , and stammered he was afraid the waiver would be a matter of weeks . " Maybe not , " said Scott , and the general gave him a tightlippednod . " Supposing , well just supposing , said Scott laughing " how soon could you leave Chicago ? " " The funeral 's tomorrow , " said Jay . " Any time after noon , I guess . " " Is n't there a will to probate , executors to keep an eye on , affairs to settle ? " " I 'm leaving my cousin a power of attorney , " said Jay . " Most unwise , " said Scott : , " but I 'd do the same myself . " " One of those Austrian eightyeight naval guns we were just talking about , Scott , " said the general dryly , " may settle all our affairs . " The general gave jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you hear the detonation . . . You 'll find the army a tough school , young man , but you 'll find that it saves you a lot of civilian worries . " Jay had gotten to his feet . Ile felt like saluting , but he was afraid he 'd do it wrong . " I 'd better move along , " he mumbled . " Quite right , " said the general , who had turned his back to walk over to the desk . " Scott where were we ? " Scott gave him a friendly shove towards the door . Too soon jay found himself back in his own room . It wastwentyfive minutes past eight . and there was a war on and what was he going to do all day ? He fidgeted over the newspaper untilp175nine and then he called up Captain Kendrick . After hanging ten minutes on the phone and arguing with many subordinate voices he reached Captain Kendrick who answered curtly that he 'd done everything he could do , the application was on its way to Washington . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish up his law course . If his address was Boston the application would possibly be handled through Governor 's Island . There was no more to say . Next Jay called up Luke . " Power of attorney , " said Luke . " Commission , " said Jay . Luke tittered . He would call up General Coates again , the generalhad said at lunch that Jay was undoubtedly officer material . He was recommending him for a reserve officer 's training camp . When Jay hung up the receiver the hotel room seemed smaller than ever . He pulled out his watch . Only nine fortyseven . There vv as a war on and what was he going to do all day ? He sat down at the desk and hurriedly wrote another letter to the New York law office where they were recruiting for the ambulanceservice . Please would they let him know by telegraph whether he 'd been accepted . He was ready to sail immediately . When he 'd finished the letter and mailed it in the Shute by the elevator it was still only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do all day ? If that day dragged , Tuesday was worse . As soon as he was out of bed Jay called Scott Bronson 's room . Scott 's precise voice answered ( Good old Scott always there when you needed him ) that he had no news . Jay had better call him soon after noon . He hoped Jay was holding himself . in readiness . There was nothing more to say . The wartime morning dragged . When the time came to drag his heavy feet up the brownstonesteps of the house on Wharton Place , the frockcoated undertakers ' men at the door did n't recognize him . In the drawingToorn the faces were all strange . As he backed into the hall Mary O'Toole surprisingly stately in black crape was blubberingon his shoulder and clinking her rosary . " God rest his  |p176soul  . He was a sainted man . " And could that homely redhead picking nervously at black lisle gloves too tight for her be Annie ? Jay blushed in spite of himself as he shook her hand . May and Augusta holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veils . Jay was trying to decide whether he ought to kiss his halfsisters when a tall woman in purple wearing long black gloves , with yards of purple crape wound round her neck , attached herself to his arm . She had a tall bony face and a high arched nose under a mask of powder . " You do n't know me Jay , but I know so much about you . As a theatregoer you must know my lace ; though of course , sometimes one is n't recognized . . . The footlights are so flattering ... I 'm Lola , of course , the Lola Paradise . Your father and I were such warm friends over so many years , such beautifulbusy years since that first giddy night when I opened in Business is Business in New York and he was waiting for me in the green room . Yes dear , I 'm English and I 'm so proud of you . Luke told me . You are going to fight the Hun . How I 've prayed for this moment when America would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 've had so many dead ... le looks so sweet just as if he 'd lain down for a nap . You know he used to come to me to forget his business cares . " She put her finger to her lips and gave her mascaraed eyes an upwardroll . " One of the great minds , selfeducated , but for an American , well read . Mellow like old wine . We had intellectualinterests in common . It is a funeral worthy of him . He was much beloved . Yes dear , you must n't grieve . We know that everything is for the best . Everybody who is anybody in Chicago is here , just like an important first night . . . He loved my first nights . . . Dear , I rather like the vulgarity of Americans . . . there 's something openhearted about it . . . The judiciary , the bar , the cloth . . . We English are so staid . . . Tears ran down the governor 's face as he walked past the catafalque . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " But I mustn'tp177talk . It is time for meditation and prayer . My secretary wilt save the clippings and send them to you . They 'll mention my name , but I do n't care . Lola Paradise is above the breath of scandal . God bless you dear . " She flitted off through the crowd leaving behind her a tinkle of invisible bracelets and a strong scent of patchouli . Jay found himself filing in a line of strangers up the stairs . As he glanced back over his shoulder he saw Luke and Mortlake with silk hats held over one arm and a photogravure expression on their faces greeting arriving dignitaries . They looked like carefully retouchedcabinet photographs of themselves . Jay looked down at his own suit . It was light gray and baggy at the knees .. . This was no place for him , thought Jay , but it was too late to turn hack now . He was a stranger in a line of strangers shufflingover the oriental carpet in the library . Over their heads he saw the sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead used to know so well , Caesar 's friendly bust , the glass bowl where the black snake lived . Diogenes was dead . Jay could n't turn back . Jay had to walk past the bier and look , wearing a false face off one of the undertakers ' men , down into the bier where lay a waxwork mustachioed figure that was not Dandy . ( That 's enough , thought Jay . ) He slipped down the back stairway into the empty kitchen and out past the ashcans in the alley . He 'd left his coat and hat in the front hall but he could n't go back for them . He never could go back . He walked fast down the streets and scrambled confusedly for a while among . coalwharves on the lakeshore looking out over the paleblue water laced with whitecaps by the punishing wind . The rushing air was sharp as knives . He looked at his watch : it was past twelve . Hands and ears half frozen he hurriedback to find a drugstore on Michigan Avenue . With pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message . " Read it please , " he said , shivering all over . " Leavingtonight for Washington . Better come along . Call me in myp178room at one p.m . " " Oh thank you , thank you very much , " he said to the telephone girl and hurtled out into the wind and into a taxicab . That night the vicissitudes of fortune rolled merrily over the rails , as the learned Poggius and his friend sat in the diner of the Baltimore and Ohio train drinking Scotch and soda while they waited for their meal . The place and the object , which were Jay 's commission and , veiled in hush hush , General McCleod'smission abroad , gave Scott Bronson ample scope for moralizing . Over a brandy after dinner Scott sketched out European history from Waterloo to the Battle of the Marne . " I have a theory that the eighteenth century will probably turn out to have been Europe 's golden age , the nineteenth the decliningafterglow . Yes , I know all about science , the Alexandrianswere scientific too . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waiter a pair of brandies . " When the levee en masse took the place of the professionalarmies with their humane courtesies and their plumed hats , it was the barbarians at the gates , the barbarians from below . " It 's time for a new Gibbon to describe Europe 's Declineand hall . . . My these are small brandies , how about another ? Jay you can thank your stars you were born in America instead of in some uncomfortable stone village in the Italian hills , as I am glad my ancestors had the sense to move out of what has since become a squalid mining slum in Northumberland . . . Because . . . Suppose we have a brandy jay . . . I have a theory that we are the most barbarous of the new barbarians . Our mission , the general 's and mine and yours maybe when we 've wangled that waiver , will be to prepare the way for the first invasion of the American barbarians . We 'll make Attila the Hun look like a piker . We 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to prove that democracy equals civilization . " ( Scott 's drinking too many brandies , thought Jay ) . This was the first time he 'd drunk hard liquor himself . He 'd only drunkp179beer and wine before . He was noting with interest that his head did n't swim , his eyes felt clear ; maybe he had a good head . No he was n't the least bit drunk , he reassured himself as he rose to his feet to go back to his berth to read . This time Scott had let him pay the bill and it was steep . ( No use worrying about money , thought Jay , when in six months I may be like Dandy dead . ) When he 'd crawled out of his clothes  --  he had a lower this time  --  he lay clearheaded and wide awake noting carefully how transparently the words stood out on the closeprintedpages of War and Peace . He saw the people and scenes of the novel before him like looking down into a theatre full of warm clear light . ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington when they climbed out on the station platformit was spring . The sun shone rosy through new leaves on columns and porticos . The shrubberies were full . of flowers . The monument pointed a white finger up into a robinsegg sky dappled with pearly white clouds . Against the dappled sky flags waved , stirring the blood . Except for the rippling flags the city seemed quiet ; there was a hush about the traffic moving slowly between budding trees on the broad streets . On the sidewalks past the Treasury and White House a few elderly colored people strolled slowly in the sun . It was very quiet in the dark old corridors of the War Department . Nobody seemed in the least bit of a hurry . Sergeants rose silently to attention as Jay followed Scott Bronson 's trail into offices that had shutters for doors . Elderly colonels seemed to have time to chat in measured sentences , looking pained at any militaryquestion , but talking volubly about everything else ; except of course about Jay 's commission . At lunchtime they walked with a ruddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a silent club in a mossy yellow building where ancient colored waiters served them very slowly while the major talked at length about the sterling qualities of the Spanish horse . In the afternoon the Department seemed to prove even slower . Jay began to lose track of what was goingp180on , nodding in his chair as he listened to conversations over yellow desks until at last , with Scott making suggestions over his shoulder , he found himself drowsily filling out a new set of application blanks . Then he was threading his way after a silverheaded sergeant with a mess of papers on a board under his arm through a corridor packed with waiting civilians . " You 'll have plenty of time to order your uniforms , " the sergeantwas saying . " It 'll be a couple of weeks before we get the results of your physical . " After leaving his clothes in a locker Jay was waiting again in a line of weary nudes moving through a groundglass door towards a medical officer . The small pudgy man ahead of jay was figuring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for physical examinations since he 'd first started applyingfor a commission six months before . He was multiplying by sixty to get the seconds when his turn came . The man behindJay said he had attended every Plattsburg training camp since they were started . When the door opened for Jay he forgot to take off his glasses . The first thing the pouchyfaced medical officer did was to reach out and pull them off jay 's nose . I le wiggled them in front of his eyes against the light and handed them back quickly , as if they were burning his fingers , with a frown and a shake of the head . " Waiver , " whispered Jay . " Waiver , hell , " said the medical officer . Once Jay had managedwith shaky hands to get back into his clothes he hurried in consternation through corridors full of homegoing civilian employees , back to the office where he 'd left Scott . " Never say die , " said Scott laughing . " We 've got a new wrinkle . We understand an order has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment the major who was such an admirer of the Spanish horse tiptoed out through a pair of swinging shutters that led from an inner office . He smiled encouraginglyat the sight of jay 's dejected face . " Take this letter , " he said , " to Captain Stimpson at Governor 's Island who is about to be appointed Adjutant to the C.G. A.S.S.C.p181and call his office in the morning ... If you take the midnight you 'll be among the first to apply " " Gosh thank you . Thank you . " Jay wrung both their hands and hurried to the depot to get himself a berth . When he stepped off the ferry next morning in the dark old slip that smelt of horsemanure the first thing he did was call Governor 's Island . Captain Stimpson was not in his office . Jay got himself some breakfast and hung for hours breathing out the air of phone booths while the city roared around him until at last he raised a pleasant southern voice that said it belonged to Major  --  Captain no longer  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about a corps of interpreters . He suggested that Jay mail him his letter of introduction and that he arrange an appointment later in the month . Jay gave him his Cambridge address . " I guess I 'll be going back to lawschool , " lie added in a broken voice . Before he left the booth he found Tad Skinner 's number in the book and called it just on the chance . " Who 's ' at ? " Tad answered in a choky kind of voice . " Jay Pignatelli . " " How did you know I was home ? " " Chance . I just happened to be in town . Say Tad do you know anything about the ambulance service ? " " Sure Jay , I know all about it . Meet me someplace . " " When ? Where ? " " Meet me at the Harvard Club in an hour . " Jay staggered out of the phonebooth feeling all in . What on earth could be the matter with Tad ? He was usually so pleased to see old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drove uptown through the roaring unfamiliar city and left it in a room at the old Murray Hill Hotel where he 'd stayed once years ago with Petite Mere . Walking to the Harvard Club through the noontime crowds  --  Lord how many pretty girls there were , brighteyed as mice , how cutely dressed  --  he had to wait at the corner of Fifth Avenue while a Nationalp182Guard regiment wearing campaign hats and canvas leggings , rifles on their shoulders , with field artillery and three brassbandsmarched by . As far as he could see up and down the avenue the red and white of American , French and British flags stirred in the blue haze . Standing on the curb looking , hearing , smelling , helpless to move , he felt fixed in the ground , inert as a post . Everybody else had a part to play . Fortune 's vicissitudes are stalled , thought Jay . Under the flag in the club entrance Tad was waiting for him looking taller and scrawnier than ever , his necktie as usual crooked and a button off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't coming . " He put both hands on Jay 's shoulders and whispered hoarsely in his ear . " If I sounded like a shit over the phone , forget it . " " I just want to know about the ambulance service . " Tad looked apprehensively up and down the street . " Let 's go to a place where we can talk . " Jay followed Tad 's long unevensteps to a beery bar on Sixth Avenue . " A pail of suds , " said Tad as they slid in under a scrubbed board table . Tad looked fixedly in jay 's face out of brown eyes . " I du n no where you stand , Jay , but in the years since I left college .. . You know I used to be all for God for country and for Yale .. . my eyes have been opened to the iniquities of the capitalist system . I write and draw for radical papers . I did a cartoon against conscription . The reason I sounded so funny over the phone is that the wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Federal agents . " " But what would they care about the ambulance service ? " asked Jay laughing . " Well there was a girl there . I have n't told her I was going yet . " " Where ? You old Lothario ... "  | " To drive an ambulance in France . . . You see she 's a pacifist . She goes all the way . I do n't . I do n't believe in compulsionbut I 'm willing to volunteer . " Tad leaned back yawning and stretched his arms so that his shirt began to pull out from under his belt . " Let 's have anotherbeer and how about lunch ? " " Tad who do you know down in the office where they do the recruiting ? " " She thinks I 'm still working for that advertising agency , but I 'm helping them out clown there , " Tad went on abstractedly . " Then you can get them to ship me , " shouted Jay . " You see my position is this . I believe that war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think a man can conscientiously serve as a noncombattant . Nadia says it 's wicked to take men out of the firing lines just to be patched up and sent back to the slaughter . " " What does she want to do , leave them lying where they fall ? " asked jay . " But Tad , my problem is different . I applied months ago asking them to hold off till June so I could finish up at lawschool on account of my father . " His voice faltered . He felt his throat stiffen . " The situation has changed . We 're in the war now . I want to do something right away . " " Why did n't you tell me that in the first place ? " Tad laughed like he 'd burst . " You did n't let me get a word in edgewise , you old wobbly orator . " " Stuff and nonsense , " said Tad banging with his fist on the corner of the table . " The I.W.W. is quite wrong . The workingclass must take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an outmoded conception . " " For God 's sake call that office before they all go out to lunch . " Tad 's long frame opened up like a jacknife as he lurched to his feet. 184 Chosen Country " All right give me a nickel and order me a small steak . " Jay sat on the edge of his chair holding on to his knees with cold hands until Tad came back . " Ed Winston 's in , " drawled Tad , " says to bring you along when I come to the office at two thirty . . . But do n't breathe a word about this radical business clown there . They do n't know about my cartoons . ' They might think I was n't enough of a gentleman to be a volunteer . They 're a smug bunch . " " But Tad how long will it take ? " " We 're shipping men on every boat . . . We have to get you a passport and a vaccination . New sections are forming all the time . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license ? " Jay shook his head . " Better get one . " Jay was so excited he shovelled in the food without tasting it . He kept looking at his watch . At two he managed to get Tad , who was insisting that there was plenty of time , out into the subway . In the downtown lawyer 's office everybody was pleasant and vague . Very much Harvard . The vicissitudes rolled smoothly . Passport application . " You 'll get your uniformsin Paris , carte d'identite . Sailing date hush hush but soon . " The next afternoon fresh from the South Station a stranger from terra incognita was revisiting the ruins of Mooney 's Pleasure Palace . Of course Fred had n't expressed Jay 's things to Chicago . At the Law School there were knotted brows but after all we had to win the war . In a week he was back at the now familiar Murray Hill , pivot of vicissitudes , the new Jay 's home . The old black elevator man recognized him . Then a series of days on Tenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal combustion engine . Traffic hazards and then one morning a phone call and Ed Winston 's voice in a deliciouslyPorcellian drawl . Ready ? Good enough . Then perhaps you would drop in the office with your duffle at ten A.M. tomorrow . We 'll direct you from there . Jay strode around thep185room , hefted the new already bookfilled khaki canvas dufflebag and the folding campcot and bedroll strapped up together and gave a consoling pat to Dandy 's old portmanteau that would be left in terra incognita with the castoff Jay 's civilian clothes . There was the phone gladly chiming : it was Tad . " You coming ? " asked Jay breathless . " Where ? Oh of course . . . I forgot . No . Maybe next time . Meet me on neutral ground at the Harvard Club and then clown to the village for supper to be introduced . " " What village , " asked Jay dimly . " Greenwich Village , you dope . Nadia 's friend is very advanced . She believes in free love ; that 's a little too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can protect yourself . " In the bar at the Harvard Club they drank manhattans . It was the first time for Jay . As he turned back to the bar to set his glass clown he saw a familiar mustache above a bobbing cherry . The army officer was Scott . He introduced " Captain Bronson . . . Tad Skinner . " Blushing he added . " Never got word of any of those commissions so I enlisted for six months in the ambulance service . " He felt a little as he had when Scott had asked him if he had made the Law Review . Failure stung . The manhattans in a new round were soothing and brown . Jay stood sniffing the bar smell of lemon and orangepeeland whiskey and bitters , thinking what splendid friends . " When are you sailing ? " " I 'm not free to say , " Jay answered , proud of getting the cue . Scott grinned at him approvingly and lifted his glass . " And you ? " Jay asked teasingly . " Hush hush , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stuff and nonsense , " said Tad . " The only people who know anything about this war are the German spies . " Over a fourth round of manhattans Scott started talking eighteenth century , asking Tad if he agreed with Jay in admiringthe reasonable Augustans.  | " Stuff and nonsense , " shouted Tad , " the most conceited period in the history of man . . . Jay what time is it ? " " Seven fifteen . " " Come along with us Captain Bronson , " Tad said . " Let 's all go . We can talk better at Giovanni 's . The girls 'll be getting hungry . " " We must n't keep them waiting . " Scott brightly gave the ends of his mustache a little brushup with his knuckles . " Captain Bronson do n't you go preening your mustache at those girls , " said Tad . " A man of travel and experience in the eighteenth century can cut us halfbaked hobbledehoys out in a minute but you must n't do it . These girls are art students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh and puffed his chest out . " Never met an intellectual woman yet , " he said , " who had a grain of sense . " " Stuff and nonsense , " shouted Tad Skinner lolling back in the cab with his flopping red necktie under one ear . Already they were halfway clown Fifth Avenue . The cab swung around the Washington Arch and , too soon for Jay who was trying to think of what he was going to say to the serious art students , drew up in front of an old brick house on a dim street . Tad went romping ahead of them up four flights of stairs . The top floor was filling with shrieks and giggles as Scott followed more sedately as befitted the uniform of the United States Army . Jay dragged his feet after . The topfloor rooms had been thrown into one studio . The walls were hung with huge purplish nudes of indeterminate sex with bananashapedarms and legs . Two girls , one square and dark and the other one small and blond , had Tad down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to sew a button on his shirt while the short one sat on his chest . " Nadia and Sonia , " he panted . " Meet my friends Captain Bronson and Jay Pigna-telli . " Nadia the dark one with the needle in one hand and the button in the other turned her face up and looked at Scottp187severely . " Well 1 suppose it 's no fault of yours that you wear the uniform of slavery . " " Do n't mind Nadia , " cooed Sonia smiling at Jay . " She has a terrible Oedipus complex and it makes her bitter . I 'm a pacifist myself but I do n't hold individuals to blame for the crimes of their class . " " Let 's go out to dinner . I 'm starved , " shouted Tad wrigglingup off the couch . Nadia was tucking his shirttails back into his pants . Then she fastened his shirt collar and retied his necktie for him . " It 's not the style to show bellybuttons this . season , " she murmured in a loving voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " she added and gave him a kiss on the chin . " I 'll brush it , " said Tad distractedly striding off to a bureau with a mirror above it against the further wall . " You see her father was six foot six , " explained Sonia . " If Nadia could only transfer to Tad . " She uttered a devout sigh . " I myself am highly exogamous , " she added turning her dull blue eyes up toward Jay 's ; " I have a weakness for the Latins . " At dinner in an Italian restaurant , they ate spaghetti and drank a great deal of red wine , and argued at the tops of their voices . " To think , " said Nadia , " that I should be dining with a Prussian . " " Takes a Prussian to catch a Prussian , " said Scott . The ends of his mustache bristled . " All militarism is the same , " said Nadia . " The workers of the world will rise and sweep you off the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussians off the earth first , " said Scott tartly . " The world will be a better place for the working class and for everybody else . " " The aim of all militarism is the subjection of the workers , " said Nadia angrily . " There 's no distinction between citizens in the Constitution Of the United States . . . " began Scott . " A thoroughly reactionary document , " interrupted Nadia.  |p188By  the time the waiter served the spumone , Scott was angry . He set down his spoon and got to his feet and made a stiff bow . " If you will excuse me , " be said , "  --  I have an engagement .. . Coming , Jay ? " Jay had Sonia 's plump little leg twined about his . It did n't seem to be the moment to get up , so he waved his hand . " As attorney for the defense , " he said , " I guess I 'd better hear what the plaintiffs have to say . ( Got to take the plunge sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Well , do n't do anything I would n't do . " Scott pushed a five dollar bill into his hand and stalked with stiff mincing steps out of the restaurant . " A reactionary little bantam if I ever saw one , " said Nadia . " Nadia , " said Tad , " when you are older you 'll understand that it takes all kinds of opinions to make a world . " " Listen to him , " Nadia giggled happily as she stroked Tad 's cheek with a square grimy hand . " He 's a week older than I am and how he puts on airs ... Of course he looks younger , do n't you think so ? " she asked Jay . " Some people have the gift of eternal youth . " " She 's effecting a transference , " whispered Sonia squeezing Jay 's knee under the tablecloth . . . " Your friend 's a narcist , that 's the trouble with him . " " Scott 's a prince , " said Tad vaguely . " A prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strega . " The strega was too sweet so they tried fiori alpini which was sweeter , then they went back to brandy as better for the digestion . The girls talked about Freud and modern painting and Brancusi and world revolution and how their hopes marched with the proletariat into the muzzles of the Czar 's machine guns . Tad talked about poetry and imagism and the revolution of the word . Jay listened feeling that he was in terra incognita indeed . His left arm was around Sonia 's plump little waist while his fingers explored the ribs under her plump little breast . Suddenly the waiter was advancing with the bill.  |p189jay  disentangled himself from Sonia and discovered that they were the last people in the restaurant and that the chairs were upended on all the tables . Right away they were out in the street and he 'd pulled Sonia into a doorway and was kissing her . He found her little tongue meeting his . " Tell me you love me , " she whispered . Jay 's lips could n't seem to form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands travelled down into the small of her back and pushed her hard against him . His hands pressed on her soft little buttocks . She pushed him off . There were footsteps on the sidewalk behind them , shadows off the streetlamp . A great dray pulled by big gray horses went clattering past . She took his hand . " My place , " she whispered . " How about Nadia ? " " She and Tad have gone walking probably . Sometimes they walk all night . They get into his place by the firescape . Nadia 's radical but she 's very conventional . They kissed at the next corner under a policeman 's indulgentleer . Sonia handed jay her key so that he could open the door . They kissed on every landing . When they got into her studio Sonia gave a little whoop and ran to the bathroom . She came back in a moment with a bottle of gin and two tumblers . " Let 's get a little bit drunk , " she whooped and splashed straight gin into the tumblers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we drunk already ? " jay asked laughing . " My you 're a funny boy , " she giggled . " You like little Sonia ? " He took off his jacket and went into the bathroom to wipe his glasses that were getting smeary . He looked at himself flushed and redeyed in the spotted mirror over the wash bowl . " Hello Casanova , " he said aloud . When he came back she had put out the lights and was lighting a fire in the grate . The kindling flared up round big lumps of coal . " Bottoms up , " she cried putting the tumbler up to his mouth . " Bottoms up , " he answered andp190started pulling awkwardly at her dress . Their wet lips met . Their clothes showered the floor around them . Holding her bare body tight to him with one arm he could n't find a place to set the tumbler so he drank down the gin . The tumblers rolled away across the floor as they wriggled sweating together on the goaty rug in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Everytime he put his hand clown there she pulled it away . They rolled and wrestled clumsily on the floor until the sweat on his face began to turn cold . The raw gin was going to make him throw up . He got shakily to his feet and went to the bathroom and threw up carefully into the toilet . Throwing up left him limp . He felt his way back into the studio and found her passed out cold stark naked in front of the fire . He had all kinds of difficulty lifting her on the couch and turning down the bedclothes to cover her . His head was already beginning to hurt when he climbed panting into bed beside her . Sharp day through the skylight overhead cut into his eyeballs and woke him . He jumped up and started to grope over the floor for his clothes . His stomach churned with bile . An iron crown was tightening inside his head . His eyes looked out of fiery rings . Casanova hell , he told himself as he dressed . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away before she woke up . Stiff with dismay he stood still in the middle of the floor . The blond head on the pillow looked very far away like through the wrong end of a telescope . Her face was creased and gray like cold dough . Full of hatred for his body inept under his clothes he stood in the middle of the studio gnawing at his lips . He guessed he 'd better kill himself . Then the learned Poggius remembered what General McCleod had said in Chicago about eightyeight naval guns . Hit you before you heard the detonation . He began to feel sorry for himself . The Germans would attend to the killing . Nature 's tricks . It had even happened to Casanova . He felt awful sorry for her too . Poor little girl he ought n't to have let her drinkp191so much . Damn fool . He tiptoed over and kissed her cool shoulder . She did n't stir . Closing the door gently behind him he hurried down the gritty stairway . At a corner he found a florist just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Be sure they 're white because that 's important and do n't deliver them before noon , " he said when he had recited her address . On the card he scrawled : " Bacchus the enemy of Venus . Morituri to salutant . Jay . " Jouncing in the subway local full of freshwashed people with early morning faces jay sat with his eyes closed letting the hangover like an angry bird gouge at his brains with beak and claws . The eternal prosecutor inside his head was giving him what for , telling the learned Poggius he was a damn pedant to have written that morituri business on the card . She 'd wake up thinking that nogood bastard . Belisarius the eunuch . The hapless Abelard . Oh Christ . Now weep for Eloise , and the Rideau Canal and the girl on the Saskatchewan . By the time he pulled weakly through the revolving door into the hotel he had begun to plan the sonnet he ought to have written her : Now weep for Abelard , poor Heloise .. . But he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel lobby sitting on a crimson plush settee was Luke , wearing his green suit and light gray spats like Dandy used to wear with a small derby on the seat beside him and carrying a cane and yellow gloves by God . " Where on earth did you come from Luke ? " Luke looked him up and down , with distaste thought Jay . " I hardly need to ask where you have cone from . Saying goodbye to the pure flowers of American womanhood , eh ? " I le introduced a sallow sagging man in black . " Mr. Funaroff is a notary public . If you had been a little more considerate you could have saved me the fatigue and the estate the expense of a sleepless night on the Twentieth Century . I understand you 'll soon be leaving for foreign shores . We ca n't let you leavep192without giving Bill Keezer your power of attorney and I have one further document . " Luke smiled his man of the world smile and poked Jay in the ribs . " Out laying pipe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jay . There was something almost friendly in Luke 's tone as he added going up in the elevator , " Well , it 's a family failing . " " I only have a moment . I have to pack . I have an engagementdowntown at ten . " " Why we just caught you . They were very hush hush at Winston 's office , " said Luke . " We 'll only keep you a moment . " He brought a bundle of papers out of his inside pocket . " In order to function the executors must have your power of attorney . Furthermore I 've brought along a deed by which you turn over your interests in the real estate to your sisters . It 's a mere formality . But we must be able to sell at a moment 's notice to the best advantage . We do n't know when we 'll see you again . " Morituri to salutant , the words trooped through Jay 's headache . He nodded vaguely . " While Mortlake and I will be worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be doing the grand in a distant land four thousandmiles away as the boss used to say . . . By the way , " Luke 's voice dropped to a confidential whisper , " I hope you 'll take careful precautions against venereal disease . I understand it 's a great problem over there . A coup de pied de Venus " ( Luke 's French pronunciation was execrable ) " is no joke , do n't forget that . " ( If he only knew , thought Jay . He thinks I 'm a prune as it is ; God if he only knew . ) " Why do these legal documents always have blue covers , " he asked . " The color of hope , " said Luke . Jay almost liked him for that . He signed each document without reading it . " You freely acknowledge this to he your signature ? " Jay nodded . Mr. Funaroff mournfully notarized the documents in a small scratchy hand and stamped them with his stamp . " These are merely formalities , " said Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Jay just to say something.  | " It 's the seal of the State of New York , " said Luke primly . " Did n't they teach you anything in law school ? " " Eyes bleary , I guess , " muttered Jay . " Well Luke I 'm afraid I 've got to pack . " " Anxious to get rid of us ? " Luke gave one of his little hackinglaughs . " Well give my love to the rue de la Paix . If you need another loan , just wire inc . " " It 'll be the rue de la Guerre I guess , " Jay muttered as he followed Luke and Mr. Funaroff to the elevator and politely rang the bell for them . Luke had settled his little derby on the side of his head . Jay noticed that he gave a little triumphant whisk to his coattails as he stepped into the elevator . ( Well that 's the end of Dandy 's bastard son 's inheritance , thought Jay . . . And the mess of pottage , comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pedant , but a goddamn fool , said the eternal prosecutor . ) His headache weighed on him like a fourth piece of baggage as the new Jay scratched his possessions together and paid his bill and tipped the porter and got himself and his bags bundled into a taxicab . " Pier fifteen Hoboken and goodbye and good luck " was the word at the office . After the ferry ride and much backing and tilling of the cal ) in and out of wharves that sentriesblasphemously guarded it was like getting home to climb the gangplank of the French Line boat . The linedup stewards , the accented French , the close buttery oniony varnish smell made Jay remember a small boy with glasses holding onto Petite Mere 's hand and the flowers and the flowing veils and the baskets of fruit and the bands playing of all the Atlantic departures . When he followed the steward to the Purser 's office to turn in his ticket the short army officer in a trench coat hung about with instruments in polished leather cases just ahead turned out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where have we met before ? " he shouted . They slapped their thighs and laughed . ( Fortune 's grand vicissitudes , thought Jay . ) " The only question I can ask you young man , " he said ,  |p194bright  mocking eyes boring into Jay 's , " is a question no gentlemancan he required to answer . " The flush on Jay 's lace in church , " he said . Jay had a cabin to himself . The bilgy smell and the throaty French of the dark chunky little steward who said his name was Dantec at your service and the ocean mustiness of the blankets on the bunk were inexpressibly soothing . " C'est le reve , monsieur . On va gagner la guerre . " Dantec stood in the doorway and tapped himself on the chest . " Moi . .. trois ans de tranchees . Cinq blessures . Reforme . . . Vive 1'Amerique , " he cried and latched the door from the outside . Jay tore off his clothes and stretched out on the bunk . He could hear dimly the vibration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book open , he 'd slid off happily to sleep . When he woke up they were at sea . It was a stormy crossing . The racks were always on the tables . Only a scattering of passengersat meals . Jay enjoyed the solitude : he felt a little squeamish the first day but after that he ate onion soup for breakfast and washed down gigantic meals au beurre and a fail with carafes of bordeaux and walked round and round the wet swinging decks breathing deep of the saltsaturated air and looking out over the steep slaty rollers flashing green and marbled with spume where they toppled and broke in the steamship 's wake . " You seem to be enjoying yourself , jay , " said Scott joining him one day after lunch on his unending tramp round the empty boat deck . " Do n't do anything but sleep and eat , " said Jay . " And wear out the deck , " added Scott . As they passed the skylight aft over , the smokingroom they could hear the muffled clamor of voices from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the bar . " Cheer up Napoleon you 'll soon he dead , " they sang . " A short life and a gay one . "  | " I guess I ought to learn to play poker , " said jay glumly . " What the hell for ? " asked Scott . " You know the motto of the Abbaye de Theleme : Fais ce que voudras . " " A guy does n't always know what he wants , " said Jay . " As the general said that morning at the Palmer House , the army saves you a lot of civilian worries . . . My own life , I might as well admit it , was getting hopelessly unmanageable . Do n't you ever get married jay . " " Better to marry than burn , " muttered Jay blushing . " My wife Aubrey 's a very superior woman and we have two of the cutest children you ever saw . Francis is eight and jenny is six . They live in Indianapolis . And what do I do but get mixed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed up with a girl named Greta . " Jay did n't say anything . They took another turn around the deck . " I was brought up to consider myself a gentleman and I try to do the decent thing but I have an incurable tendency to wake up in bed with the wrong woman . . . That was why I had to get out of the diplomatic service . " " Sometimes it looks to me , " said jay hollowly , " it would he worth while . . . with any woman . " Scott gave him a quick dark probing glance . " How old are you , Jay ? " " Twentytwo . " " I thought you were older . . . Well this was one of these blond aristocratic Spanish bitches . Blood of the Goths , the Spanish minister 's wife in Bogota to be exact . Aubrey was mighty understanding about Concha . Aubrey likes high society . It was the husband who did n't understand . He tried to have me removed , by a fellow with a knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a short selfconsciouslaugh . " But Aubrey wo n't be understanding about Greta , " he went on . They took another turn around the deck.  | " I have a theory that the war 's like the waters of Lethe . If we get through to the other side everything will be forgiven and forgotten ... " Jay gave an assenting growl . " When I was your age jay I had a theory marriage would cure the complications that wise old apostle lumped under the word burn . But it 's not so easy as that ... Maybe I did n't marry the right woman . . . But anyway if those eightyeights do n't get me I 'm promising myself a tender middleaged afterglowof marriage with Aubrey . She deserves a little real happinessand by God sometimes I think I do myself . " Jay wanted to say something about himself but the words dried up in his throat . " I guess it 's time for a nap , " Scott continued briskly . " At five I 'll wake you up to take you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of finding you a niche once we get overseas . " " I 'm in this for six months , " said Jay , " unless the army takes over the whole shooting match . " Scott said as they turned clown the creaking companionway together , " I thank my stars night and clay we are going to be in on this show from the beginning . " " Mc too , " said Jay vigorously , balancing on one foot as he turned down the long seesawing corridor towards his stateroom . " It had never occurred to me that war was fun . " As they neared the Bay of Biscay , the liner began to steer a zigzag course , and pairs of drowsylooking little sailors with red pompoms on their caps appeared in the corners of the boat deck : the extra submarine watch . There were lifeboat drills , the covers were clamped on the portholes and ship 's officers with furrowed brows kept checking on the darkbluecurtainsthat were supposed to keep any chink of light from showing out of the companionway doors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signallingto submarines out of portholes with cigarette lighters . These last days the passengers were jumpy , stewards spilledp197soup at meals ; in the smokingroom the collegeboy volunteers kept their spirit up by finishing up the ship 's stock of whiskey and singing : Oh we 're bound for the Hamburg showTo see the elephant and the wild kangaroo We 'll all stick togetherIn fair or foul weatherAnd we 're going to see the damn show through . The last morning jay had just finished shaving when gongs in all the companionways began to clang to quarters . His heart thumping he put on his overcoat over his shirt , shoved a couple of books in his pockets , fastened the awkward cork lifepreserver round his middle and trooped in a straggle of out of breath passengers up to his station on the boat deck . The opaque green sea moved with a slow glassy swell . A red sun hung like a balloon in the brown mist ahead . " Damn those Boches , " Scott was saying when jay joined him . " They would torpedo us before breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside them started to hand around sections of a huge bar of milk chocolate . " My mother never let me swim until two hours after eating , " said jay shaking his head . Scott laughed and brushed up the ends of his mustache . " You 're a card , jay , " he said . " But honestly , " said jay blushing , " we must be near the mouth of the Gironde . There are lovely bathing beaches along there . I was taken to them when I was little . The water 's much warmer than the Channel . " All the same the hands fumbling at the corners of the books in his pockets were cold . His heart seemed to be trying to climb out of his chest . Meanwhile cinders fell on their heads as I resh gushes of brown smoke coiled from the blacktipped red sucks . " They are stoking her up ... " " The men I take off my hat to , " the colonel said , " are the engine room crew . "  |p198It  was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their white breasts flashed in the sun . One of the ambulance men had rigged a kind of kite alt and was trying to catch a gull with a piece of paper on a hook . For a long time they silently watched the grills and the smoke billowing overhead , the color of chocolate where it caught the ruddy sunlight . All down the long glistening decks from the bow to the stern stood silent groups of men and women in life preservers . A few lifeboats had been swung out . Every stick bobbing on the water looked to them a periscope . Then they began to see a little smudge right under the sun . Under the smudge they could begin to make out the irregularly spaced stacks of a toylike French torpedoboat speeding towards them on a curl old foam . " All right suppose we go down to breakfast , " said Scott . " We have to wait for the signal , " said the colonel . " Look , do you sec what I sec ? " " It 's a sunken ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to make out a cloud of white steam and two tiny scratches of tilted masts and the tiny triangle of , i ship 's bow almost awash . The toy torpedoboat circled cheerily round the liner . There was great gargling of French through megaphones from the bridge and the torpedoboat shot off into the sun again . As they drew near the sinking ship Scott handed his binoculars about politely . Iav had trouble adjusting them to his eyes . He caught just a glimpse of wreckage and boats and black dots that might be heads . The liner was cutting fast through smooth water , brown and muddy now and littered with flotsam . " We 're not going to try to pick them up , " groaned Scott . " Why the sons of guns . ' ' " Probably the rescue is being conducted from land , " said the colonel . " There 's the lighthouse . " By now they could see lighthouses on either side , and lightersp199and tugs and the faint outline of a low piny shore . Through his binoculars Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liner nosed under one bell into the coppercolored waters of the estuary , the tricolor was run up aft . A puny little cheer went up from the groups at the life boat stations . As the gong sounded stewards went around among the passengers telling them that the petit dejeuner was on the table . " It 's war deluxe by gad , " said Scott as he dug into his grapefruit . After breakfast Jay stood on deck watching the low hills patched with palegreen fields and the crisscrossed vineyards and the silvery stone mansions and the rustyroofed villages clustered round their churchtowers and the light poplars and the dark pines gradually pirouetting as the banks of the Garonne slid by flattened by the sunny haze like a painted panorama , like that longago scenery of strange lands creakily unrolledfor Petite Mere and a small boy on the train of the Transsiberian . Even then crazy for vicissitudes thought Jay . Dantec the steward had come ' up behind him . Jay heard his low throaty voice . " Elie est belle n'est-ce pas Monsieur Pignatelli ? La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved stone facades of the riverside buildings of Bordeaux . The great dark casks in ranks on the flagstoned quays smelled of the dregs of wine . The cavernous station and the toy train full of redfaced poilus in long blue coats smelled for jay , in spite of the war , of longago childish travels in that world with Petite Mere . ' When they piled out of the stuffed compartments next morning at the Quai d'Orsay Jay half expected to see her waiting to meet him in a lace veil and puffed sleeves on the station platform . But the women he saw wore black and had anxious lines round their eyes . The bluegray streets of Paris had a hush about t hem . The horsecabs had the same red wheels and little squawkinghorns . There were the old women selling flowers , the smells of cheese and strawberries . He was not a bit surprisedpwhen , after standing round for an hour in the rue Francois Premier with the rest of the crowd waiting for the chef of the section to show up , he found he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et d'Albion which was Petite Mere 's hotel . The afternoon Jay first wore his uniform he met Scott lookingneat and plain in stiffnecked American khaki among the light and dark blue and the goldbraided kepis and the turbans and the burnouses and the kilts and plaid trousers and the rainbow ribbons and the scarlet stripes of the uniforms packed round varicolored drinks set out in the rosy sunlight at the Cafe de la Paix . " Sit down , " Scott said pulling him into the only empty chair in sight . " It 's the crossroads of the world . " As Jay sat down two French officers , sleeves glittering with service stripes , moved heir chairs to give him room . " Pardon monsieur . Jc vous demande infiniment pardon . . . Americains . . . . Ah les braves americains . " He heard the words rumble in a ripple round about as he tucked his legs cased in unaccustomedputtees in under the tiny chair . The air smelt dense of perfume and woman 's hair and coffee and freshbaked rolls , with occasionally an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky , " Scott was saying with his dry little laugh , " that the French have decided to treat you ambulance boys as officers . Otherwise I would n't have this pleasure . The general is a stickler for rank . " " As you said Scott , it 's the war deluxe , " Jay mumbled as he sat looking out through the carnal flush of faces and the fuzz of hair at the sauntering men and women that filled the pavementbetween the terrace and the news kiosk under the tree . Among the rigid forms of darkcoated civilians and the young men in all the uniforms ofd the Allies , girls moved soft and playfulas kittens . They dressed more plainly than in New York but their eyes had a different look . Every glance you met seemed an invitation to bed . Poilus in pale blue cuddled their girls shamelessly as they strolled . Horsecabs and green buses and taxicabs ( the famous taxis of the Marne , whispered Scott ) ,  |p201moved  back and forth behind them with squawking horns against sunlit graystone buildings , marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets in front of the Opera . All these women , jay was thinking tinglingly to himself , with their clean cuffs and their tiny lace jabots and their dark dresses gently indicating the curve of breasts and hips , moving quietly through the mellow afternoon , were gently leading their men , leading and led , through narrow stuccoed streets to ancient doorways and up steep chill stairways into rooms garlandedwith gilded cupids and gently between sheets to bed . L'amour a cinc heures . He was remembering a picture he 'd seen that morning at the Louvre . The pavements of the grands boulevards were quays , like the quays of Casanova 's Venice , where in the dim spring light in the scent of lily of the valley you embarked for the island of carnal love : Embarcation Pour Cythere . " It 's the war deluxe , " he said - again , drawling to keep the emotion out of his voice . " We do n't do anything , " said Scott , " except eat sevencourse luncheons and attend vermouths d'honneur . " Scott sat straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knuckles as he looked about him . " Jay , there are places and times where all the women look beautiful . I-how can Mother 's darling boy keep on the straight and narrow ? Answer me that , jay . " " I spent a good deal of time , " said Jay , " as a kid with my mother round this part of the world . It makes it all seem kind of dreamy . " " What I 'd like to do , " said Scott , " is get a cab , and just ride around this town and look . There 's nobody else I could even suggest such a thing to . . . If we sit here we 'll just get entangled with women too soon . " " Let 's go , " said Jay . " Garcon ! " Exchanging military civilities and parrying arresting looks from dark eyes and halfsmiles from cupid's-bows as they squeezed their way out between crowded tables , they slid pastp202wandering couples to the curb and hailed a horsecab . Cloppety clop the redwheeled cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You tell him where to go , " said Scott leaning back against the darkblue cloth of the seat . " All I know about Paris is from books . By gad this is pure pleasure . " " Au Palais Royale , " said Jay . Ile was rolling a hoop ahead of Petite Mere across the pale gravel and the fountains played and there were pigeons in the air and they were on their way to lunch in the sun at the little tables outside of Vefours and they met the little old woman who always dressed in violet and lace and was a countess and wore a little black patch at the corner of her mouth . The old lady was squatting down pour faire pipi amid voluminous violet skirts behind a bush right in the middle of the public garden with arcades of people walking by all around . " Is n't she naughty ? " giggled Petite Mere as the old countess came trotting up to them nodding the little ostrich plume in her tiny bonnet and smiling as if nothing had happened . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everything that has ever happened to people in a given environment lives on in it somehow . I 'm sure that when we get to the Palais Royale we 'll find a Duke of Orleans handing his newest mistress with a patch on her chin out of a coach ... " " I knew her when I was a small child , " started Jay laughing , but Scott went on withoutlistening ... " Or Camille Desmoulins climbing on a chair to harangue the bloodyminded multitude . That is why all this destruction . . . Rheims and Louvain . . . is so terrible . In America we tend to think of it all as stage scenery , but it 's more than that . . . By gad that 's the Cafe de Paris . " " It certainly is , " said Jay . " Cocker , arretez un moment s'il vous plait . . . We 've got to have a drink in honor of the great Gustave and the eminent Russian sportsman . . . With the grand old buildings , " Scott went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " allp203the fabulous ghosts of the past that enrich the present vanish ... " The waiter had sideburns . " Champagne , " said Scott . " We 're on the trail of the Grand Dukes , " cried Jay . The champagne was a long time in coming . They fell to talking about Flaubert 's " Temptation of St. Anthony . " " I have a theory , " Scott was saying ' , " that if Flaubert had been more of a journalist he would have been a greater writer . " At last the aged waiter came tottering back followed by an acolyte with the champagne in a bucket . With ritual solemnity he popped the cork while the acolyte stood by as if for a flag raising . With trembling hand lie put a drop in Scott 's glass and then filled the two glasses bubbling to the brim . " It 's warm , " said Scott tasting it , " but no matter . " He raised his glass dreamily . " My country ' t is of thee , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no question in my mind that we will eventually lick the submarines and drive off the Hun . The question in my mind , the question I would not dare ask the general or Colonel Knox , is , what will we do with Europe when we 've saved it ? " By the time they had drunk the champagne and had gotten the long bill from the hands of the aged waiter an hour had gone by , so they told the cocher to just drive past the Theatre Francais , where Scott solemnly saluted the statue of de Musset ( " The youth of a century , " he said ) , and to drive right on to the Ile de la Cite and the Sainte-Chapelle . " We are turning back the time machine to the centuries of hunger and religion , " Scott was declaiming , " but Paris is still Paris . These great old cities are like coral reefs . Generations of individual lives have left their imprint on them but somehow they keep a living unity of their own . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . Good Heavens , this must be the Pont Neuf . Vive Henry of Navarre , the first modern man who dreamed of a United Europe and said that Paris was worth a mass , " he said as the cab came out on a buttressed stone bridgep204across the green Seine . " Now these houses in brick and stone are in the style of the period of Cardinal Richelieu if I 'm not mistaken . . . Cocker , ou est la Place des Vosges where Victor Hugo lived . . . but let 's not mix our drinks . Better stick to champagne and gothic . Ever read Villon ? " " I bought him to take to the front , " said Jay , " with a glos-sary . " The guardian let them in among the sandbags in the tall hush of the chapel and explained that the stained glass windows were being taken down " a cause des gothas . " " It 's a jewelbox just the same , a jewelbox of the Holy Ghost , " said Scott . " We 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added as they climbed back into their cab . " There 'll be a full moon . We may be among the last who ever see this masterpiece . . . You see jay . " He was sitting bolt upright lookingfrom side to side as the cab clattered down a narrow riversidestreet . " It 's like Gibbon 's chapter you were reading that day on the train . Imagine finding a law student reading Gibbon . " Ile laughed and slapped his knee . His hand suddenly arrested rose to his mustache . " Look , the little one in black with curls on her forehead . The perfect midinette . And her feet . . . like little e stole in and out . . . As I was saying , I have a theory that a civilization lives so long as its buildings stand . When those goddam Boches knock down a fine old building they are shooting far into the past . The past and present are inseparable . The future 's barren without the past . " " There are always the books , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classics , but to tell the truth books are a bloody bore . Life is so much more . . . These old cities mould people 's lives . Arretez un moment s'il vous plait . " The cocher cranked his brake and the horse dug his hind hoofs into the cobbles . At the end of a street they could see a corner of the facade of Notre-Dame and the flying buttresses that reared like prancing horses . " Let 's sit here at this dump . "  |p205It  was a tiny cafe with only four tables out in front . There was a hubbub behind the bar when Scott ordered champagne .. Finally a bottle of five franc mousseux was produced . " No matter it 's the idea that counts , " said Scott . " NotreDameis so much finer than its photographs that I 'm frankly flabbergasted . It has everything the Parthenon has and more . " They sat for a long time looking sideways at the corner of the great structure . Then they walked around in front while the cocher followed them keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cab . They went inside . When they came out blinking from the soaring darkness of the nave the cocher greeted them with an air of relief . " Anglais ? " he asked . " Americains , " cried Scott . Ah americains , ca va . Je me mefie des serbes . " " I guess they wear khaki too , poor devils , " said Scott . Scott glanced at his wrist watch . " It 's time I picked up the general and Colonel Knox . This is the night they saved out to see the town . Jay , you 'd better come and be our guide . " " I know this town as an eight year old child . About all I could guide you to would be the Punch and Judy shows in the Tuileries Gardens . Besides I promised to meet Reggie . " " Who is Reggie ? " " Reggie Coleman is my roommate . He 's the son of a divinityprofessor but he sure has a way with the petite femmes on the boulevards . We 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . . . We 're going to wear mufti . The general'sheard about the French cancan all his life and now he 's determined to see it . " " We have to wear our uniforms . The gendarmes tend to raid the boulevards at night to pick up embusqucs . Several of our boys were picked up while they were waiting for their uniforms . And they are so pained at the Embassy if they have to do anything for an American like getting him out of the jug . They dined at Voisin 's . Jay kept wishing he was out amongp206the varied carnal evermoving crowds on the street . It was like being tied in a straitjacket , sitting on the seats of amber plush making polite conversation . Brigadier General McCleod 's dry meticulously chiselled gray features took on an odd hick look when he wore a tuxedo . Jay felt as if he were taking out an elderly relative from the country . The colonel and Scott looked out of place in their tweeds . Reggie , who was a foulmouthed pimply youth with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a continuous state of suppressed giggles because the general thought he was Scott 's friend he 'd met in Chicago instead of Jay . They ate pressed duck and drank various wines but the conversation had to be squeezed out of a tube . Towards dessert Scott warmed up with " I have a theory , General , " and launched into Henry and Brooks Adams ' disquisitions on the decline of civilization . When the general began to get inattentive he came to the point . " As what we are really doing over ' here is fighting to stave off that decline , we really ought to see what it 's like . " " Scott , you always make me feel better , " said the general in a sarcastic tone . " Joe Knox and I were feeling a little ashamed of ourselves for going on a slumming expedition and here you make it all seem respectable like going to a lecture . " " An adventure in human archeology , " began Scott , " starting with what is probably the finest restaurant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " interrupted the general . " I 'd be happier with a nice dish of ham and eggs and good plain old bourbon and water . Jay was remembering that he 'd been in that restaurant before . This was n't the first time he 'd suffered that straitjacketfeeling of sitting too long at table with the grownupson the amber plush . Of course it was with Dandy and Petite Mere the night that Dandy sent back the pheasant . Little Jay had been kept up later than usual , so he was very sleepy and he was n't hungry because they 'd all been to the Guignol on the Champs-Elysces and let him ride on the merry/goround and eat galettes with sweet cream in them and they 'd sent home his nurse because Dandy was in a gay mood ; he 'd just completed some great deal connected with a railroad in Italy . He 'd bought Jay a set of little cards with pictures of all the locomotives in the world and Jay sat shuffling them drowsily happily imagining chug chug toot toot , the great engines puffing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 'd looked up from his engines and the waiters were bringing the most beautiful bird in its feathers all gold and brown . It was cooked inside its feathers , Petite Mere explained . Jay was hoping it would fly when the waiter pulled off its beautiful feathers and Dandy looked closely at the roast bird holding his glasses in his hand . Then he shook his head and frowned and sent it away ; too high or something . Jay cried and carried on , too tired probably , and squirmed so on the amber plush that he had to be sent home with the chasseur in a cab to the hotel where that scolding nurse , not Jeanne , but the old cross one , Marie , was waiting to take over ... . " But they are morally degenerate , " the colonel was saying . " The Marne , Verdun and now the Aisne . Nothing degenerateabout the French fighting man , " the general insisted . " Let 's go see , " Scott insinuated . After dinner they drove to the Folies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise and the big naked women who , Reggie said giggling , were all English girls , the French girls had n't got the legs ; and soon found themselves out on the crowded pavement waiting for- a taxi again . " They 've got other things , " said Reggie . " Suppose we go and see what they 've got , " said the general . " Scott will talk us into putting our researches on a high intellectual plane . " The.taxi took them to a dive in a cellar Reggie knew up on Montmarte . There they drank champagne and danced with tall women in slinky dresses to an orchestra of tziganes . Everythingwas very brassy in there . To get away from the noise Jay went to the bar . There he found himself alone with Scott.  | " I have a theory , " Scott was saying , " about the soldiers and the whore . War and bad times is when they flower . In good times they lie dormant in society like a worm in a cocoon . The hot sun of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean love  --  that 's an entirely different matter , although the act is very similiar ) lie deep in the roots of instinct . There 's a dedication like a nun 's or priest 's , a terrible abnegationof all the lovely things of life in both careers . Other kinds of people in the world build catherals , raise families , make bread and champagne , weave cloth and grow vegetables . The soldier and the whore destroy . The soldier destroys life . The whore destroys love ; they have deep affinity for one another .. . N'est-ce pas ma petite ? " Ile patted the cheek of a catfaced woman who was insinuating herself onto the stool between them . " Qu'est-ce qu'il dit ? Qu'est-ce qu'il dit ? Oh qu'il est mignon . " The rest of the party had fallen into the hands of an individualwith patent leather hair and eyes in deep creases above high flushed cheeks , dressed in some sort of a Balkan uniform , who was mustering them to see an exhibition in a maison publique . ay and Scott followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had just begun to breathe in the darkness and to look about the fresh moonlight night when the sound of the airraid sirens rose sharp like rockets into the air . " The safest place to see this show , " said Reggie , " is from the top of Montmarte . " Reggie and jay found themselves running breathless up steep cobbled streets and up black stone steps into the moonlight . " I do n't like those damn houses . They charge too much , " panted Reggie . " Give me the girl of the streets every time . " " What a horrible evening , " Jay was saying , " but I think we 've given them the slip . An airraid ought to be an excuse for anything , " Jay added when he 'd gotten his breath . " Look , " said Reggie . He grabbed jay 's arm with a shaking hand.  |p209The  milky sky overhead was becoming lined with white bands of searchlights . By the time they reached the balustrade at the top of the hill little spangles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking over the roofs and towers and domes of Paris that lay helpless and brittle under the moon as a showcase full of pastry sprinkled with powdered sugar . Behind them the cement basilica rose grotesque and smooth , a collection of variously shaped cheeses in a market stall . " Listen , " said Reggie . The air was full of a distant singsongrumble of motors . Round the edges of the city antiaircraftguns barked like faraway dogs . Jay 's heart was pounding but he was too little part of the scene to feel frightened . It was the childhood dream of being alone high up in an immense empty theatre , high up and the fear of falling . The moonlight was cold . They stood side by side , shivering a little , following with their eyes the sparkle of shrapnel and the anxious pointing fingers of the searchlights . Motors grumbled unevenly overhead . The tension snapped when there was a sudden crunching sound and a pink glow of fire rose gently away off across the Seine somewhere and another and another . They waited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruddy stains that were developingdelicate tendrils of flame . It was hard not to want to see the whole city afire . " Let 's go , " said Reggie . " All talk and no pussy makes jack a dull boy . " They ran down the steps and into the stony darknessof narrow slanting streets . " That 's the all clear , " said Reggie , as they heard the little squeaky fireengine , the breloque , honking like geese as it scampered through the streets below them . They dove into a slow crowd of soldiers and women snuggled in darkness that moved along a wide avenue under the barely seen trees . In an instant Reggie was walking between two girls . " Hello sister . " He already had his arm round the pretty one . " Me zigzag . . . vous rigajig ? " he was shouting . The other one had anxious eyes and a wide gash of a paintedp210mouth . Jay did n't like her looks . At the corner he slipped away and headed off at random through stone lanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last days of Pope Eugenius the Fourth , Jay was saying to himself as he walked searching through the streets bisected with moonlight , the learned Poggius and his friend ascended the Butte de Montmartre and having viewed from that commanding spot the wide and various prospect of desolation . . . At a Metro station in a bright stadium of moonlight in front of a church with two towers he ran head on into a little girl with a heartshaped face and dark brows . " Bonsoir mademoiselle , " he said politely . She gave him a sharp look . " Americain ? Quelle chance , " she said and burst out laughing , quite nicely , he thought . His hands were cold . The brassy haze of the champagne had worn off leaving him empty and scared . His legs shook . He wanted his bed . His feet ached from the cobbles . ( Now or never , thought Jay . ) " Si on allait boire un coup , manger une soupe a Mignon ? " His voice was uncertain . Not at the Halles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was too expensive there . She knew a place . Chattering away as if she 'd known him all her life she led him into a tangle of little streets and alter some scampering back and forth tapped at a shutter that showed a streak of light . An old woman 's creasedup face appeared in the crack . The shutter opened and with an iron clang closed sharply behind them . ' ' J'ai de la veine madame , " the girl was saying simply " C'est mon premier americain et it park francais . " Of course the girl 's name was Jeanne . By the candlelight he could see that she had long eyelashes and her clothes were neat . They slid into a bench behind a table in a little brown cellarlikebar like a piece of a catacomb lit by a single candle . Jeanne took Jay 's hand while she argued with the old woman whose creased face was plentifully garnished with gray hairs . ( " Cold hands warm heart , " she whispered to jay in parenthesis . ) After a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire was out and the oven cold and a little brandishing of crisp blue banknotes by Jay , the old woman went to the kitchen in back . " Toi aussi t'a de la veine , " said Jeanne . " J'ai pas fait le trottoir ce soir . " And she 'd been that day to the doctor 's ; she was very careful about the hygiene , she explained . The doctor of course had to have his petit benefice but un medecin to sais  --  c'est ce qu'il y a du plus hygienique . She had n't been on the streets that night , she repeated , because she 'd been out to see her mother at Meudon . She 'd been caught in the Metro in the airraid . The gendarme would n't let her out of the station . " Les eclats c'est dangereux mais les bombes moi je m'en fiche . " Of course her mother did n't know . Her mother had placed her with a dressmaker . They worked for la haute couture . On fait du beau travail mais on est @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her wages so she picked up a little money on the side . The old lady was glad enough to have the money and she never asked where it came from . After all she was n't really a putain , Jeanne said tossing her hair back , she never went with a civilian . . . sales embusques . . . Les poilus ... que voulez-vous ? C'est la guerre . Je serais to petite marraine . A la guerre comme a la guerre . " By the time the old woman was back with the soup and a bottle of wine Jay had stopped shaking . He felt limp as a tired kitten . They sat snuggled together on the bench because it was cold under the stone vault of the empty bar and he was looking tenderly at her two little hands all scarred and marked with needlework that he held in one of his . With his lips against her ear he told her about Jeanne his nurse and les petits venventres . Par example ; she laughed . They drank every drop of the soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold vaulted stairs of the little hotel next door . Embarcationpour Cythere , he whispered as she unlocked the bedroom door . His hands were shaking again . The sheets were so icy that when they had taken off their clothes they had to snugglep212very close together to keep warm . " Quand meme , " she whisperedas she drew him near to her . " C'est gentil l'amour .. . Ah on est bien entrenche . " When they woke up his whole body felt easy . They yawned and stretched and smiled at each other . They were slow gettingdressed because they had to take their clothes off again half way . He gave her fifty francs and she gave him a friendly kiss and scribbled her address on an envelope he had in his pocket for when he came back en perme . He must never go with anybody else not in Paris at least .

When Jeanne glanced up from breaking bread into her big white bowl at the streaky yellow face of the clock flanked by dark bottles a hove the bar she gave a little shriek . " Je me sauve , " she cried , " I'atelier . " Jay finished his ( ( Alec alone , said " Au revoir , madame , " and walked home to the Lille et d'Albion in peace through the early morning streets full of the clatter of iron shutters being pushed up , busy streets that smelt of cheese and fresh vegetables and of soap from the scrubbed floors of freshopened bars , and of horses and stables from where the cabbies were polishingup their hacks while their horses led out of nosebags under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , and incense from the sepiashadowed doorways of churches . The muscles of his legs felt springy under his wellbelted uniform . His feet trod lightly on the paving stones . His eyes travelled lovingly over the carving round ancient doorways . He peered into courtyards and studied shopwindows and read theatrep213posters that seemed immensely amusing . As he came out on a corner of the rue St. Honore he caught a glimpse through the arcades of the gilded statue of Jeanne d'Arc in a rosy swath of sunlight . Jeanne of France . Jeanne is the name of France , he whispered to himself . Up in the hotel room he found Reggie , thicklipped with splotchy skin , sitting on a towel in a chair beside the lace curtainsof the tall window applying propho . " Goddam whores , " Reggie was muttering . . . " I put one over on them last night . I gave her twenty francs in advance and when she went to sleep I took it back and hightailed it for home . Never let ' em take your pants off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kit , just in case , and went off into the corner of the room with it . " How did you make out ? I bet you always pay what they ask and more . A feller ca n't be too careful with whores . " Jay grunted again and began packing his dufflebag to keep busy . He could hardly wait for the hours to go by until afternoonwhen they were to report at the Gare de L'Est to take the train des permissionaires out to Bar-le-Duc . There they were quartered in a big clean cement hall in a closeddown distillery . The Fiat ambulances were new . The Fiat motor was a dream of simplicity . The chef and the souschef were grand guys . At night the shuttered cafes were full of Frenchmen singing : Au pres de ma blonde , Qu'il fait bon fait bon fait bonAupres de ma. blonde Qu'il fait bon dormir . Jay drank the sour pinard and remembered little Jeanne and felt the blood hot in his veins and thought vicissitudes hooray and sang loud out of key with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinding past over the cobbles they could hear the big guns on the front pounding like surf to the northward . When orders finally came , the section moved in a convoy over sunny roads through fields of oats and wheat ,  |p214still  green , where a few first poppies were beginning to bloom , up to a stone village where the Fiats were drawn up in rows in a stone farmyard that smelt of cows . Their division was en repos . The barns were all full of Frenchmen , so the ambulancedrivers slept on the brancards in their ambulances . They had twentyfour hours on duty and twentyfour hours off , but duty was fun , driving round the country taking sick poilus back to the field hospital in a pretty little silver and white chateau that had a garden full of yewtrees . The only sour note was an occasional haggard man shot through the foot or the hand . Squarefaced military police in helmets had to ride along with those cases . " Oh , les vaches , " the Frenchmen standing round the hospital court would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the division was to go up into the lines the medecin divisionaire , a smiling man with a great black spadeshapedbeard , came to invite the ambulance drivers who were off duty to a dejeuner being given in honor of some American officers who were touring the front . The dejeuner was in a camouflaged marquee that was being put up as an addition to the Hopital de Triage . The officers wore all their decorationsand t here were American and French flags on the long table of boards set on trestles and a bottle of mousseux for every two eaters . Right away up at the other end of the long table near the French general , Jay caught sight of Scott sitting up straight and alert and brighteyed with a military bristle to his mustache . After the toasts to les braves Allies and the speeches in English and French everybody rose to their feet while the divisional band which had arrived a little late played the " Star Spangled Banner " and the " Marseillaise . " While cigars and cognac were being passed around the officers moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damnably of disinfectants , to stretch their legs stiff from sitting on the hard camp stools . Scott came up behind Jay and tapped him on thep215shoulder . " Of course we meet everywhere . " They both laughed comfortably . " It 's a small war , " he said . Scott asked Jay if he 'd been to the front yet . Jay shook his head . " Me neither . It 's always like this , " he whispered . " The French want to break the facts of life to us gently . The general wo n't drink in the field , the colonel . turns down his glass so I have to uphold the bibulous honors of les Etats-Unis . It 's a good thing I 've got a sound liver . " Jay said suppose he came for a ride in an ambulance one of these days . Scott whispered darkly that maybe they 'd move up with the division to see how a division took over . The medicin divisionaire was a grand guy , whispered back Jay ; he 'd know where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first time Jay and Reggie saw   it was a quiet day . They drove up through many quiet villages full of troops until the road and the landscape began to take on a motheaten look . They began to have to avoid holes in the road that might have been made by shells . It was a beautiful summer morning . Larks soared singing out of the wheat on either side . They found their way past the first gun emplacements through a village that was just walls , no roofs , and past an occasional wrecked truck that had pitched into the ditch ; and turned into a rutted lane along a hedgerow full of little clustered pink flowers ; and then through a wood cut with muddy ruts going in all directions where they had to pick their way over occasional gravelly patches ; across a slope that had trenches dug along the crest , to a grove of beeches in a curve of the hill . There a Red Cross flag fluttered on a stake above a pile of stones that had once been a chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except in the far distance , the guns were silent . Jay and Reggie did n't have time to look around because in the deep abris built into the foundations of the chapel enough wounded were already waiting to fill the car . No stretcherp216cases but silent men with hollow eyes in long mudcovered blue overcoats draped with bloody bandages and smelling of mud and sweat . The smell of blood . The doctor was a pallid piefaced frowning man with his helmet on the back of his head . " Revenez vite , " he said as he handed Jay the handful of papers that went with his wounded . " Et mettez vos casques . " He tapped his own helmet with a threatening forefinger . " Ca va taper dure . " It took them a long time to get hack to the field hospital because the road was solid with slowmoving trucks hidden under a pall of dust . The infantry was coming up . They were no longer the jolly Frenchmen singing in the cafes . Their faces were pallid with dust . They looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back in low gear . When Jay rode round to the back of the field hospital tent to collect some bidons of gas it seemed quite natural to find Scott waiting for him . " Our little excursion is put off until tomorrow , " Scott said . " How long does it take you to make a round trip ? " " A couple of hours , " said Jay airly . " Come along . " " I do n't mind if I do , " said Scott . . Got a gas mask ? " Scott dug at something hung under his trenchcoat under the crisscrossing straps of his various polished leather cases . All three of them squeezed into the front seat and they started off with Reggie , who muttered that he felt jumpy and wanted to drive , at the wheel . Traffic was slow through the empty villages . They had to buck a double line of trucks full of stubblefaced mudcovered men coming out of the trenches full of hoarse shouting and tuneless songs . A long trail of artillery was stalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the place where their lane turned off across the fields behind the hedgerow when a sentry stopped them . " Arrives . . . Boches , " he shouted . While they were arguing with him a shrill whine rose out of the air getting louderp217and louder and ground into Jay 's spine as it tore the sky . This is it , thought Jay . The three of them sat frozen knee to knee in the front seat of the Fiat ambulance . There was a roar on the road ahead and a rattle of pebbles and the whining sound of eclats . " Good enough , " said Scott in a matter of tact tone . " Baptism of fire . " " There 'll be three more , " the sentry shouted up at them out of the ditch where he lay flat . " The Bodies are regular . " Scott was sitting on the outside . lie did n't move so jay could n't . Jay could feel Reggie 's arm trembling ; he slipped his hand round his waist and grabbed his leather belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of blood in his mouth but straightaway when the whine began again he knew he was n't going to yell , he was n't going to jump , he was n't going to do a goddam thing . The Boche aim was excellent , but as there was nobody at the turnoff the shells just dug deep pits in the road . When the light smoke drifted towards them on the wind it had a bitter smell of almonds . After the four shells the sentry jumped up at them red in the face . " Idiots , " he shouted . " Taut s'abriter , nom de dieu ! " " Let 's get the hell outa here , " Reggie mumbled between his teeth . He slipped the car into gear and charged round the edges of the still smoking shellholes . Grinding and plunging on its springs he swung the car across the road and went bouncingalong the rutted lane . The already familiar hedgerow with the little pink bunched flowers immediately gave Jay a nonsensicalfeeling of security . Behind the hill where the reserve lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of soup came from them . On top of the hill a Frenchman standing on a pile of sandbags that protected the mouth of a trench was waving a wire basket of salad in a broad circle in the air . Reggie was still white around the gills , but jay and Scott were laughing about how the French had to have their salad no matter what , as they drove through the purely imaginary shelter of the little rutted wood until they218 Chosen Countrycaught sight of the great silver boles of the beeches . Reggie backed the ambulance around and parked it neatly in front of the Red Cross flag . " Now which way are the frontline trenches ? " Scott was asking in a businesslike tone . The three of them were standing beside the car stretching . Jay was planning how he was going to introduce an officier americain to the doctor in charge of the dressing station and Scott was checking on his binocularsin their leather case that hung in the crowd of other polished leather cases round his trenchcoat , when all at once they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit that was the entrance to the shelter . The little wood had blown up around them . Explosions seemed to come from every direction at once . The air was full of whining steel and the wooden crash of ripping branches . Just before Jay dove head first through the blanket that sheltered the door of the abris he saw one of the great silver beeches beside him rise with nodding boughs into the sky . At the same moment Reggie came clown on top of him in a mess of flung mud and driven gravel . Although he had no breath in his body Jay was laughing when he picked himself up . The merriest little brown Frenchmanwas helping him scoop the mud off his uniform . " C'est le barrage , quoi ? " There was something heartwarming about the way he gargled the language deep in his throat . " Yaura un coop de main . C'est reglementaire . " The doctor with die round white face came up and shook Jay 's hand . " C'est l'initiation , heir ? " he said . " Faut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The doctor tried to shake Reggie 's hand but Reggie sat on the edge of a bunk while the mud ran off his hands clasped to his knees , looking up at them with an expression of frozen distaste . He would n't give his hand . He would n't move . The whole hill shook as if steel giants were beating it with.  |p219sticks  . ( A rabbit , thought Jay , when you dig out his warren . ) " Mais oil est l'officier americain ? " he shouted above the din . The little brown Frenchman shrugged . The doctor shrugged . The shrug travelled through huddled figures up into the dimlit dressing station beyond . As Jay made for the shaking blanket in the door the little brown Frenchman moved his finger back and forth across his face , meaning no . Jay stuck his head out . He had to crawl up the slippery mud slide through a tangle of leafy boughs . The leaves were reassuring . These helmets were very well made , Jay was telling himself reassuringly . He stuck his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat on his belly under a pile of brush . There was mud on his mustache . " Conic on in . . . Scott are you all right ? " Jay whispered in a lull in the din . He could n't help feeling they were perfectly safe under the leafy brush . " Knocked my breath out , " Scott groaned low . Jay inched over to help him up . When he put his arm round Scott 's body to help him to his knees his hand came away sticky . Again the smell of blood . Jay let himself slide back into the shelter . " Reggie give me a hand . Scott 's hurt , " he shouted . Reggie sat without budging staring at him with that expression of frozen distaste . " Americain blesse , " Jay shouted into the dim light of the dressing station . " Merde alors , " said the little brown Frenchman and movingvery slowly reached for a stretcher that hung from hooks on the ceiling , opened it carefully and motioned to Jay to take the front handholds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy jabs of terror with every bursting shell but the explosionshe kept telling himself were further away . The eclat whined high overhead . They dragged the broken boughs away from Scott and rolled him onto the stretcher . His wellshined leather leggings stuck out incongruously from the bloody mud . Jay had time to notice that the sun was setting in a burst ofp220crimson behind great jagged trees stripped of their foliage when gagging and panting he was back in the dressing station among the motionless wounded and the smell of dirt and ether and pain . " Jay , " Scott was saying in a natural but almost inaudible voice from the stretcher , " I ca n't feel anything . I 'll get my wind in a second . Be a good fellow and see it my trench periscopeis all right . I 'll be needing it . " There was no expression on the doctor 's fleshy round face as he knelt beside the stretcher . Jay turned his back suddenly when the doctor started to cut open Scott 's tunic ; he had to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reggie 's shoulder . Reggie was still shaking . There was no way of movinghim . Ile would n't look up . He did n't answer . His muscles were rigid but his whole body went on shaking . Jay went back to the doctor . The doctor was just putting away his hypodermic . The little brown Frenchman slipped a folded blanket cinder Scott 's head . Scott 's skin was paper white ; his eyes were closed . Fortunately he still had some morphineleft , the doctor was saying . Just for a second Jay let his eyes travel to a little tiny dark moist spot that had already appeared on the broad belt of bandage round Scott 's middle . " Grave ? " he asked . " Au ventre c'est . toujours grave . Que voulez vous ? On va 1'evacuer . " " Now ? " Jay asked eagerly . The doctor made a horizontal . gesture with a broad white hand and gave Jay an unexpected smile . " Pas si vite , mon ami , yaura des autres . . . It 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . . . Et le copain qu'est-ce qu'il a ? Better give him a drink . " The doctor plunged into one of the bunks and came back with a tin cup full of rum . " Gniolle , " said the doctor , " sans la gniolle on ne ferais pas la guerre . "  |p221They  shook Reggie and talked to him and held the cup to his lips but his teeth seemed riveted closed . " Merde alors , " said the doctor . " Let 's drink it ourselves . Viens on va manger , " he said smiling again at Jay 's coughing and spluttering over the raw etherized spirits . He slapped Jay on the back . " C'est le courage a bon marche . " He poured out another swig for the little brown Frenchman . " Outside . . . in the trenches . . . what 's happening ? " Jay asked breathless . " Coup de main . . . reconnaissance . . . How should I know ? " The doctor shrugged . Jay knew right away he should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was entirely preoccupied with his preparations for the evening meal . The little brown Frenchman lifted a greasy metal containerof soup off the floor and set it over a can of solid alcohol and brought out tin plates and spoons . " This is my operating table , " the doctor said patting the stone slab that was obviously one of the tombstones out of the chapel above . " Epatant , n'est-ce pas ? ... We must eat fast because there 'll soon be work . C'est le festin de la mort , " he added half singing in an operatic tone and his round blue jowls shook with silent laughter . Jay felt the rum burning in the pit of his stomach . A flutteringvoice way down kept repeating Please God do n't let Scott die . He was breathing in the reek of bruised bodies , the smell of blood , the smell of pain , the sicky ethersmell , but as he started spooning the hot soup into his mouth a callous shell seemed to be forming over him like another skin . He felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by God . He remembered that he had a cake of chocolate in his pocket and brought it out and divided it as far as it would go among the wounded who were watching them eat with hurt eyes from their seats on stretchers round the edges of the muddy floor . The racket had stopped outside . " La voiture , " jay said . " I 'd better look . "  |p222He  stuck his head outside the curtain . There were stars overhead . Oh God in the stars please do n't let Scott die , the little voice was pleading way down inside him . He clambered up to the level of the ground into the smell of mud and latrines and leaves and lacerated sappy wood . Occasionally in the quiet he could hear the zing of a rifle bullet from some faraway outpost . Distant machineguns started a duet . Suddenly three starshellsbloomed overhead , burned out the stars and lit up the jagged hilltop above and the ruined trees . In their light he could see the Fiat marked with the cross in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to edge his way towards the car when through the trees came swishing sounds followed by a series of dull thuds . Right above him a klaxon sounded loud . Jay gave a startled jump as if lied just missed being run over by a truck in a crowded street and tumbled back into the shelter . " What 's that ? " he asked the little brown Frenchman . " Les gazes . Quellc misere . " The doctor already had his mask on , a fancy one with a little valve in the snout that wheezed as he breathed . jay went straight to Scott but two stretcherbearers were already fastening an oilcloth affair over his face . So far as jay could see Scott was still out from the morphine . " Hey Reggie gas , " he yelled in Reggie 's ear . Ile shook him angrily . Every time jay tried to slip the mask over his head Reggie 's clammy trembling hands brushed it away . Finally Jay had to get a Frenchman to hold him while he slipped it under his chin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he felt that he was doomed . Well this was what it was like he told himself . Inside him he felt the strange peace he 'd felt the morning he 'd walked home from the night with Jeanne . " C'est un Bros bonhomme , " Jeanne had said . The learned Poggius could do what other men could do . He knew that he was n't going to jump , he was n't going to yell , he was n't going to do a goddam thing . He sat down on the bunk beside Reggie who went on shaking helplessly inhumanly like a cold dog.  |p223The  little brown Frenchman was making the go-to-sleep gesture in Jay 's direction with his two hands against the cheek of his gasmask . In the abris everybody was turning in . Jay tucked his feet behind Reggie and lay on his back wondering how soon he was going to die . His face was oddly moist under the gauze of the mask as if the skin had already started to rot . He remembered how sorry he 'd felt for himself that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now already he was going to die . Nature 's tricks , a lugubrious voice chanted in his head . Dandy was dead and Petite Mere and Diogenes the black snake . If only he could be back on WhartonPlace listening to Dandy 's voice declaiming into the ears of snakes and small boys in the privacy of the library . In the sicky smell of the gasmask he was redreaming a dream he 'd had under ether when he had his tonsils out . In the horrible choke of the ether he was being sucked down into blackness . He was swirling down a spiral corridor until at a tiny table in the corridor he sat talking to a man by candlelight but he could n't see the man 's face . A stranger may be God . He was arguing like in a bullsession in college , freshman year , about the theory of the vortex . The vortex was the absolute . This is the Absolute , the voice said and the voice was whirling and the table was whirling and the corridor was whirling , down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whirling into the blackness . He woke up with a start like from the operation with a sore throat and feeling sick at his stomach , but it was n't a nurse it was the little brown Frenchman who was shaking him by the shoulder . The little brown Frenchman had his gasmask off . From outside came a ringing , ting , tong , ting , tong like on a triangle . A Frenchman without a gasmask pulled open the blanket over the door and stepped out . Jay jumped up and stumbled after him into sunlight blazing horizontally through corridors of mist . In the yellow light he looked out on the beeches . The slick silver bark was gashed and torn . Fallenp224limbs were everywhere . A couple of great trees lay uprooted . In the midst of a tangle of roots the Fiat ambulance stood quiet and intact where Reggie had parked it . It still had its tires . Jay 's cap he 'd left on the scat was torn to pieces as if a dog had gnawed it . The body was pretty well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hood . Jay cranked her . She started . " Bon , " said the doctor , over his shoulder . " Allez vite . " Alreadythe stretcherbearers were bringing the wounded . Scott 's eyes were open now . His face had a feverish flush . He recognizedJay . " Feeling better , " he managed to say in a low weak rattle . " Always waking up in the wrong bed , eh Jay ? . . . Say Jay , I had some binoculars and a camera and that trench periscope . You check , I do n't quite trust . . . " He choked suddenly and bloody bubbles came to his mouth . Jay reached for his handkerchief and wiped the blood off the mouth and the mustache . " Thankee Jay , " Scott sputtered and managed a dim smile as the stretcherbearers slipped his stretcher into the ambulance . When Jay climbed into the driver 's seat , he found Reggie already sitting there beside him . Reggie had stopped shaking but still he would n't speak . His face was frozen into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to the wheel so as not to turn round and hit him . The motor was smooth . Jay had n't had too much practice at this kind of driving . He drove slowly through the mist jouncing over the tangled ruts of the little wood . Back of the trenches on the slope where they 'd seen the Frenchman waving the salad basket he passed the ruined carcass of one of the field kitchens . Flies were circlingover a pool of slum . Every time the ambulance bumped on a rut a groan came from the stretcher cases . He felt his way grinding slowly in second out of the curdling mist in the wood . His glasses kept fogging up . When he came out on the open field the sunlight met him like a jet of flame . There was no traffic on the lane . The hedgerow with its tiny bouquetsp225of pink flowers was weirdly unchanged . At the edge of the main road he had to stop to get out to vomit leaning on the mudguard . Before he climbed back he went round to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing ? " Frenchmen 's voices answered groaning in chorus . " Vite , vite . " Jay was n't too good a driver . When he drove fast he jounced them over the holes in the road , when he drove slow he felt he was n't covering the ground to the hospital fast enough . It did n't seem possible that the road , the villages , the stone farms should be so unchanged . The same faces of poilus looked out from every window and door following with envious eyes the ambulance grinding slowly towards the rear . At every bump the stretcher cases groaned in chorus . Jay strained his ears for Scott 's voice . He did n't dare turn to look at Reggie sitting numb beside him . At last he drove into the courtyard of the pretty little chateau all silver and white . Grayhaired attendantsin Red Cross brassards had the ambulance doors open before jay could get off the seat . Fighting down his nausea he looked down at the stretchers they were setting in a row along the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stretcherbearers had carelessly let the corner of the blanket drop over Scott 's face . Jay dropped on one knee beside him to pull the blanket gently off his face . The eyes were open and sightless . The mouth was open and a thick stream of dark blood was already drying over the chin . Jay dropped the blanket over the face and got to his feet . Scott was dead.  |p226SOME  YEARS before the dreadful war broke out in Europe her welltodo Aunt Julia invited Anne Comfort on an outing to New York to celebrate her graduation as valedictorian from highschool . She went down on the train by herself and her aunt 's lady 's maid met her among the hoardings and hammeringof the half remodeled Grand Central Station and chaperoned her across the street to where Aunt Julia , in a hat all made of violets and a spotted lavender veil , was waiting for her in the drawingroom f the Belmont . They took a cab to go to the Waldorf Astoria for lunch but were stopped by a parade on Filth Avenue . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's get out and see the parade .

When her aunt put Anne back on the train to Poughkeepsie she gave her what was left of a box of I I uyler 's they had nibbled on during the performance to take home . Anne sat eating chocolates looking out of the train window wondering whether she would rather be Mrs. Fiske serving tea out of a Dresden china pot and making such whimsical and malicious clever comments or beautiful Inez Milholland leading the parade on a whiteFootnote on Social Consciousness 227p227horse past the Waldorf Astoria down Fifth Avenue . She knew she wanted a career . She was in such a daze she almost forgot to get off when the train stopped at Poughkeepsie . The streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight after the Waldorf Astoria and Fifth Avenue ; and Mother 's house looked positively squalid . The first thing Mother asked was : did she say anything about college ? Anne declared she 'd had such a good time she had forgotten to ask . " Well my child it was your only opportunity . " Anne felt awful because she wanted to enter Vassar that fall more than anything else in the world but Mother had the others to think of and there just was n't any money to send her . Mother taught a few children elocution and dramatics on account of being the widow of George Brown Comfort  --  Daddy had been quite the matinee idol in his day  --  and gave some piano lessons and dressed dolls at Christmas and made jellies and jams , but none of it helped much to eke out the tiny annuityshe got from Daddy 's insurance . She was just a poor relationAnne told herself with a sniffle when she went to bed that night . She might as well face up to it . Next morning , to a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne awoke with a start and sat bolt upright . She glanced disdainfully at Elsie and Maud in the oppositebed who looked plain even when they were asleep with their messed mousy hair and their little turnedup freckled noses , and at the stained wallpaper and the duststreaks on the windowpanes and the cracked mirror over the bureau . She felt so awful she could n't stay in bed another minute . She tiptoed across the threadbare carpet to the mirror and studied herself long and critically . Her hair was n't any particular color but it did have a nice curl in it . She had paleblue eyes and a dice skin and a pleasant expression . She 'd heard friends of her mother 's speak of Annie 's sweet wild Irish look . By the time she was dressed she felt better : she was asking herself now whatp228bold and beautiful Inez Milholland would have done . She was insisting that they ought to give women the vote . She would have gone out and just insisted that they take her at Vassar . " I will , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feeling that she could n't stand being stifled in the house another minute she ran to the front door .

He gave her such a nice friendly look and walked away and swung himself lightly up on the seat of his wagon , and as his horse started to move , grinned back at her and said , kidding but as if he liked her , " The early bird catches the worm . " It made her feel quite pretty and after he 'd gone she walked up and down on the pavement in front of the yellow frame house and thought if they were only nice young men instead of all those old maids , they would let her go to Vassar she was sure .

She insisted so that the president 's secretary said he would see her that morning . He was such a kind grayhaired man with sad eyes and he noted down everything she said with a sharp lead pencil and had his secretary call up to make an appointment with the dean who turned out to be a freshfaced woman with beautiful white hair in a pompadour who talked crisply about exceptions in deserving cases and called up somebody on some committee connected with some scholarship and told Anne to go home and not worry and that she would be informed as soon as dispositionwas made of her application . Footnote on Social Consciousness 229p229It was only when she got home deadtired and starving for lunch that Anne looked to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Edith Wharton 's The House of Mirth . She 'd thought all the time it was Hazen 's Europe Since 1815 but she 'd been too wrought up to look . She had n't read it . The title did seem a little frivolous . That afternoon she wrote her Aunt Julia asking her , in the nicest way if she could n't help her just a little bit , since she was goingto have to work her way through college . Then she lay down on the bed and read The House of Mirth . She could n't stop reading . By bedtime she had decided she would be a novelist who wrote about the genteel ironies of life , like Edith Wharton . She never did get an answer from her letter to Aunt Julia because Aunt Julia had already sailed for Europe . She came back in the fall quite ill and died suddenly at the BelmontHotel .

" Darlings , " she said to the three girls , " there is no further hope for us from that quarter . " Anne did get a loan from the Freshman Fund but it all went for tuition and books so she had to go on sleeping in that awful little room with her sisters . Living at home it was n't any better fun to be a college freshman than it had been being a highschoolgirl . So many of the girls were wealthy and had such lovely clothes that Anne felt more out of it than ever . She did manage to scrape up a little pocket money writing up college events for the society columns of the local paper , but she hated the way she had to do it . To get them to print what she wrote she had to fill every sentence with what her mother called false values and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon and a few icecream sodas . Scrimping and saving and having to turn down dates and even an invitationp230to a hop because she did n't have anything to wear , she struggledthrough a year and a half of college , until one day , when such an interesting pale darkhaired young man , who had been invited by the sociology professor to deliver a lecture about life on the East Side , asked her to share his life of sacrifice and dedication , Anne abruptly said Yes . Anne had gone up with a group of other girls after the lectureto tell him how inspiring his talk had been . She had opened her blue eyes wide and her face had taken on that sweet look of understanding , and she had murmured shyly that she could n't help with money , but how else could she help ? He had promptly arranged for her to help him take a group of tenement children out to the country for an airing each Sunday and it had been quite fun : she liked the dirty little brats and she 'd thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever known and eager and inexperienced as a puppy clog . She felt quite tender about him right away . Poor Mother was heartbroken when Anne told her she was giving up college ; to cut the argument short , Anne and Waldo ran off down to City Hall all by themselves one Monday morning to get married and she went to live with him at the settlement house . Waldo 's salary was barely enough for one . Almost right away Anne discovered she was going to have a baby . Waldo was so preoccupied by the misfortunes and the regrettable moral degeneration in their crowded hall bedrooms of the immigrantshe worked among and by his own inner conflict :  --  How could he reconcile the evil he saw around him with a belief in the divine ordinance of the world ?  --  to put his mind on the problem of what they would do when the baby came . In spite of these uncertainties Anne was happier than she had ever been in her life . She kept those of the settlement house workers who still had a laugh left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up wherever she went . She loved the crowded streets and the foreign accents and weird smells and the odd characters from unheardof parts of the world sheFootnote on Social Consciousness 231p231would run into in any stroll round an adjacent city block . They did n't scare her . She had n't met anyone yet she could n't get around . Her pregnancy , though it did n't show , gave her a cool feminine selfconfidence . She found she could arouse admiring glances in the toughest young men and keep them at a distance with a gruff comical manner she had newly developed . After the miserable penury of her life at college and the false values of the editor of her hometown paper she felt that at last she was living in the real world . She loved it . It was Hibbert Hopewell , a young newspaperman recently arrived from Chicago who haunted the settlement house in search of copy for his articles in the New York Globe , who was always first to laugh at Anne 's tall tales . The day they met he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shocked Waldo by announcing blatantly that he was an atheist , and added that Waldo was one too but did n't dare face the truth . That night Anne played the part of the flower of the slums so effectively she never quite managed to drop it . With the pride of an explorer exhibiting a newly discovered species , Hib brought around his friends , who were writers and artists and reformers and radicals , to meet her . Waldo did n't approve of the drinking and was pained by the salacious tone of some of the conversation at the Brevoort , so when Hib next called for Anne he found an excuse not to come along ; but when Hib explained that he had to take Anne to dinner to talk to her for professional reasons , Waldo quoted St. Paul : All things work together for good for them that love God ; so Anne went . Hib was writing a story about her . The story was called " My Wild Irish Rose " and Hib sold it to a popular magazine for six hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anthology . Then Hib suggested that she ought to write up her , experiences herself , and sold her first piece to the featureeditor of his paper . Her series of articles on life in the slums was the pretext for many little dinners . Hib worked harder on her pieces than hep232did on his own . After they had gone over her manuscripts he would order more drinks and talk on and on about the philosophical anarchism of Prince Kropotkin and the natural life and free love and the beauty of the nude . Hib always seemed to have money to cover the check . He often squeezed her hand , and tried to kiss her once or twice going home in a taxicab , but admitted , when she called him to order , that there was a naked sword between them . Waldo , who had remarked one day that jealousy was an insult to the purity of womanhood , spoke proudly of Anne 's articles and pointed out at the settlement house that by seeing the humorous side she was calling attention to conditions in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne wrote a comical and touching little story called " The Waif , " about the embarrassmentsof a hunchbacked Jewish cobbler who found a baby abandoned in an ashcan during a blizzard , they all shed tears when they read it in a monthly magazine full of the names of famous authors . After that Anne could do no wrong in the eyes of the settlement house women , who tended to be old maids and plain , although they did whisper among themselves that she was a little indiscreet to be seen everywhere with a man who was not her husband . Mrs. Lavine the director declared that genius had to live by its own laws . Waldo grew pale and thin and devoted himself to the work with more dedication than ever . When the baby was horn , Hib , who had been following with passionate curiosity all the details she would tell him of her pregnancy and working them into a story called " Motherhood , " which all the editors eventually turned down as far too advanced , kept watch with Waldo half the night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Dr. Martha Richter , the obstetrician , came out to tell them the baby was a boy and mother and child were doing well , that she let out a horselaugh and said she was blamed if she could tell which was the father . Footnote on Social Consciousness 233p233When Anne left the hospital she moved into a little furnishedapartment off Washington Square she had rented with her own money during the last days of her pregnancy . Her articles were bringing her in enough to pay the wages of an old Ukrainian woman , one of her cases , as a nurse for little David and to send her mother an occasional check . While she was recovering from the baby 's birth Anne took up the habit of writing in bed every morning . Waldo , with Anne and the baby cozily housed , had seized the opportunity to leave on the lecturetour he had been planning to raise money for a camp for slum children . Afternoons while Marya had the baby out in the Square , Hib would come in to go over Anne 's manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems of Ernest Dowsonand read her the " Song of Solomon " and erotic bits translatedfrom the Sanscrit . Ile was always calling for redder roses and for stronger wine and in the end she let him make love to her . There was a good deal of talk about companionate marriage among their friends evenings at the Brevoort ; they began to think of themselves as companionate lovers . Dr. Richter who was a fervent advocate of birth control had explainedall about contraceptives to Anne , so that Anne was able to tell herself that , like the poet in Cynara , which Hib never tired of reciting , she had been faithful to Waldo in her fashion . When Marya came back with the baby , they would go out to dinner . They got to drinking and arguing rather spitefully over their dinners . The day Waldo arrived home , Anne had just had a spat with Hib because he made some jocose remarks about the sweated garmentworkers who were on strike and whose wrongs she took very much to heart ; so she threw herself with passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garmentworkers and told her that the secret of her writing was her ability to project herself into other people 's lives and to feel their sins and humiliations as her own . " Especially their sins , " she said teasingly . There was never any doubt in her mind that Waldo was thep234father of her second child , a girl whom she named Martha Richter after her friend the obstetrician . She worked the children and their nurse and life at the settlement house and her affair with Hib into a novel called East Side Idyll , which was published by an old and respected publishing house with a sale of fortyfive thousand copies , so that at twentysix she was a celebrity . Her publishers preferred to believe that Anne Comfort Welsh was herself a product of Hell 's Kitchen like the girl in Hibbert Hopewell 's story which people still remembered ; the reviewers swallowed the bait . Before long the legend was so thoroughly established that even her best friends , like shrewd and iconoclastic 1 ) r . Richter , believed it . That was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't let her mother come to see her in New York . She went up to Poughkeepsieherself almost every week . With her first really sizable check she redecorated the shabby old house and started Elsie off to college at Wellesley . Anne spent very little money on herself . She dressed simply in tweedy kinds of clothes ; she felt quite triumphant the day she insisted on taking Waldo up town to Brooks ' and buying him a really good suit . All the same she had been telling herself for some time that she and Waldo would have to get divorced : their lives just did n't fit together any more . One of the things that was beginning to worry her about her relationship with Hib was that he seemed in no hurry to have her divorce Waldo . Maybe he was afraid that if she did he 'd have to marry her himself . It was the dreadful war iii Europe that finally brought about her break with Waldo . When the papers began to fill up with accounts of the miseries of the refugees who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German invasion a young man in her publishers ' office suggested that as she had written so brilliantly of the oppressed lives of working girls in the slums and so made you feel the sufferings of downtroddenpeople , she might be just the one to do a series of articlesFootnote on Social Consciousness 235p235about the refugees that would really wring people 's hearts and would later appear in book form . " I know , " he cried looking at her fervently across the pink shade at the luncheontable at the Park Avenue Hotel , " it 's because you are those people . You really belong . The rest of us , with our bourgeois upbringing , can only see them from the outside . " She looked up at him from her plate of creamed sweetbreads with her paleblue eyes wide and that tearful smile that everybody said was so heartbreakingly Irish and said yes it would be painful but she would go . She left the children with her mother . On the French Line boat she met a young French officer , returning from a buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashes and made love with a soldierly violence that was quite irresistible . When Jean returned to the front and was killed within a week , she felt in her own grief the grief of the women of France . When she came home after three months among the European refugees , as full of the atrocities of German militarismas she had been before of the atrocities of the owners of sweatshops and of the capitalist exploiters of factories , she was all for America 's going in on the side of the Allies . Waldo met her at the boat . He 'd hardly told her how he thanked God she was back safe when he broke out : " Anne we always said we 'd be honest with each other . I have to tell you I do n't approve of your first article or of the second one . It is an appeal to hatred . We must say to the peoples of Europe : We refuse to wallow with you in the mud of war . Woodrow Wilson has with great difficulty kept the country neutral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd who hope to get profits for themselves out of sending American boys into the slaughter . " Anne turned her wide blue eyes on him and gave him her tearful smile . " But Waldo if you had only seen the poor people . " Waldo would n't listen . " I disapprove of your articles and of the speeches you are probably going to make , " he kept repeating . They quarrelled in the cab andp236when they reached the Brevoort she went in and registered alone . He stood in the lobby looking pale and gaunt and baggy at the knees as the porter piled the new pigskin luggage she had bought at " Old England " in Paris in the elevator . " Wheneveryou wish it I will arrange to give you your freedom , " he said , and stalked out the door of the hotel . The book sold well but Maud had been ill and there had been an operation to pay for and Elsie could n't seem to help being extravagant at college . Poor Waldo did n't have any money , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lire in Mother 's kitchen that ruined the whole back of the house and poor Mother had quite forgotten to renew the fire insurance . And on account of the war everything was getting to be so expensive . " I he day the news came of the false armistice , Anne , who had obtained a large advance from her publisheron a new book . started to arrange for another trip abroad . This was her chance to describe the aftermath of war in such terms that people would see the horror and futility of it all . If a book of hers could help convince people of the need of a League of Nations to enforce peace Waldo would come to understand how he had misjudged her . Poor Waldo , it had certainly been a mistake for a pacifist to back Woodrow Wilson . Shc could n't help a slightly malicious smile when she thought of it . Right now Waldo was under indictment for a speech criticizing the draft he had made in Milwaukee . It was just as well the divorce had gone through or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it was , her publishers had to use all their influence . Shc waited until the day she sailed to send Waldo a hundred dollar bill in a plain envelope to help in his defense : she sent the cash because she did n't dare put her name on a check for fear some snooper might report it . In Paris she found Hib , still in uniform as a war correspondent , living at the Hotel du Quai Voltaire . He had grown quite fat and seemed repulsively complacent about everything except about the lack of heat at the hotel . While waiting in Paris toFootnote on Social Consciousness 237p237cover the Peace Conference he was spending his time dining and wining and making a collection of international erotica . The first night he took her to see a horrorplay about a sadist in French she could not understand and to a cabaret where all the men were dressed as women . She went back to the hotel alone and thoroughly disgusted . Next morning at the bureau where she went to get her credentials visaed she met another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first saw him she thought he had the look of a very young Lincoln , the awkward bony frame and the sunken glowering eyes . He came right up to her and said in a deep voice : " Anne Welsh I know who you are and I want to shake your hand . . . I 'm Carl Humphries and I work for the Pulitzer papers ; that is if they have n't fired me yet . " After waiting together all morning on a hard bench in the dead air of the French bureau until they could get to see the proper official , they walked out through the flagged courtyard together . Anne told him about the government 's persecution of her exhusband for his pacifist views . " That 's making the world safe for democracy , " said Carl savagely . " What a farce ! " To get the smell of French bureaucracy out of their nostrils they sat down beside a little stove at a cafe to drink a hot grog . Carl began to talk about the revolutionary movement advancingfrom the east ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricane . " It 's the corning of age of the working class . " He looked at his wristwatch and jumped to his feet . He was late for an appointment . Maybe she would like to come along . It was with some old revolutionary socialists at the Buttes Chaumont who were going to bring him up to date on the movement in France . If American troops had n't arrived there would , have been a revolutionary movement to France in 1917 just like in Russia , he whispered feverishly in her ear as they stood in the crowded Metro . " Pershing 's job was to save world capitalism , not to save the French people from the Hun . " As Carl did n't speak any French at all , it was Anne who hadp238to ask the way . They found themselves all out of breath in a room packed to the ceiling with torn paperbacked books and decorated with red flags . A grayhaired man with a deep chesty voice embraced Carl : " Le camarade americain , " he cried . He squeezed Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only American journalist who really sprang from the working class . Carl 's German was dreadful and so was the Frenchman 's , so they got no further than exclamations and grunts until a young poilu came in who had worked chez Ford in Detroit and who talked good American slang . As the room filled up with deepvoiced heavyset men the poilu translatedtheir questions . Carl had been with the Russian army the year before . He 'd been in Germany and the Balkans . He had seen soviets formed . I lc had sung the " Internationale " in Leipzig and Milan . I lc had spent a night with the bolshevik leaders in Smolny . Soon the time would come he said , beating with his fist on the table , for him to throw off the mask of a bourgeois journalist . He would join the ranks of the proletariat . Everybody cried , " Vive la revolution ! " Anne asked if they were n't afraid of the police , shouting so loud , and they all laughed and said , " C'est le Club des @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noses in , not in a working class district . They insisted on taking the American comrades out to dinner in a little restaurant you reached by climbing up stone steps at the end of an alley . There they drank a great deal of wine and ate a remarkably good meal and talked about the struggles and victories that lay ahead . When they were ready to go home Anne , who felt the Americans ought to help pay for the party , brought a blue wad of francs out of her handbag . " Thanks , " Carl said reaching for them in a simple comradely way , and piled them on the plate over the bill . " The wages of prostitution , " he said , but he gave her a wink as he said it . When the proprietor brought the change Carl absentmindedly shoved it into his own pocket . They walked half across the city in the raw fog that putFootnote on Social Consciousness 239p239haloes round all the streetlights . Carl walked so fast Anne had trouble keeping up with him . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only the working class could compel peace . Only an organization with rigid discipline could mobilize the working class . The working class was on the march . " We must discipline that march . " Only America lagged , not the workers , but the leadership . " Why not Debs ? " panted Anne trotting at his heels . " He 's an old fuddyduddy , " Carl said over his shoulder without slowing his pace . " Of course , " he grabbed her arm and pulled her along beside him ; " if he would let himself be used he would make a valuable figurehead , a martyr and all that " . . . but he doubted if Debs could ever get over his soft oldfashioned bourgeois background , he could n't be ruthless . " That 's what I must tell myself everyday , " he said turning in his tracks and glaring savagely down into her face . She was rubbing her arm where he had pinched it . " I must learn to be ruthless . " He grabbed her by her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to soften a man . You must help me to be ruthless . " When they reached the small hotel over a butchershop where he was staying , he said in his simple comradely way " Suppose you come up . In Paris nobody cares . " It never occurred to Anne to say no . After that night she was only happy when she was with Carl . She moved from her respectable hotel up near the Etoile to Carl 's Hotel du Commerce , in a dirty street back of the markets , where he stayed because the proprietor was a sympathizer . It was n't often that they were together . He was away much of the time on mysterious journeys , and she had to take trips through the devasted regions to get materials for her articles . She was working harder than she had ever worked in her life . There were Mother 's bills and her sister 's college expenses and the children 's clothes and now Carl had to have money occasionally ; because , just as he had predicted , his paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sent his managingp240editor when they would n't print his accounts of some riots in Germany . The British secret service was on his trail and the State Department was trying to call in his passport and get him shipped back to America . The proprietor of the hotel would let Carl use the room even when Anne was away but he kept it reported in her name at the police station . It was hard leaving for the Balkans without Carl but she had to do it . When she reached Constantinople Hall Bryant , whom she 'd met with Carl in Paris and who was doing publicity for a relief organization , was waiting for her at the station looking unusually pinkcheeked and boyish . As they clattered in a two horse carriage to the Pena Palace , he kept asking her about Carl , letting on that he knew more about him than she did . " What a man of violence , " he cried out in a tone of admiration . " I expect great things from Carl . . . He must be a wonderfullover. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her want to slap hint . Still Anne found Hall 's company soothing . He was the one person with whom she could talk about Carl . He was full of chitchat and amusing gossip . Right away Hall took her to the resort hotel in Therapia where over a lot of alexanders in the bar he induced a young naval officer to introduce her to the American admiral so that : she could be smuggled on board a destroyer to sec the burning villages across the Bosphorus . But even being right there she could n't feel their plight the way she had felt the plight of the French and the Belgians and the East Side Jews ; she could n't feel it really : it was too awful and she did n't know the language . Hall found her Armenians who told the most harrowing stories , Greeks who had seen their children chopped in pieces before their eyes . Together they giggled at dinner over the missionaries . Charity was an illusion , like putting a mustard plaster on a man 's chest when he was dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they were n't being overheard . Only revolution could effect a radical cure . They felt very superior to the stuffy old missionaries . Footnote on Social Consciousness 241p241Back in Paris , Hall who had managed to get himself sent to the Paris office of his relief organization because he just had to be there for the Peace Conference , made himself very useful to Carl . He had picked up a French merchant seaman in some low dive who turned out to be a most reliable fellow . He helped smuggle Carl , who had grown a beard and had been furnished with a set of forged papers by the French comrades , on a freighter bound for Petrograd . Anne sailed for home about the same time . She had to cable her publishers for a further advance to pay for her passage . New York that summer had an impermanent provisional look to her . Every place was crowded , but everything seemed empty . At the Brevoort there were few familiar faces . Anne found herself an apartment in a part of the Village where nobodyknew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got back from Russia . He would probably be in hiding . She told the agent she was expecting her husband back from overseas . Now that she knew that capitalism was doomed she was n't as afraid as she used to be of getting into debt . She got behind on the rent . Aftermath of War did n't sell well at all . It failed even to earn the advance . Her publishers told her that the people who bought books were bored with European problems . So she set to work to write a silly love story , full of false values , to pay the grocery bills . But even love stories she had difficulty in placing . A new set of brash editors , full of wisecracks and fresh out of uniform , had turned up in the magazine offices who did n't make much effort to disguise the fact they thought she was an oldfashioned sob sister . Only thirty and already a back number , she began to tell herself tearfully . Of course the new radical magazines that came out after the wartime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her work , but they did n't pay . It all confirmed Anne in Carl 's opinion that capitalism was rotten and revolutionthe only cure . The trouble was she had a lot of mouths to feed until the great day cane . She began to have daydreams of herself leading the mob , like Inez Milholland on a whitep242horse , to take over the offices of the big circulation magazines in the name of the workers . It was a time of reaction said her friends when she went out to dinner with them to drink red ink in speakeasies . To be sure the reactionary Republican President the people had stupidly elected did let Debs out of jail , and Waldo too . She got a telegram from Atlanta and almost immediately it seemed to Anne , Waldo was at the door . He looked so much older . There was a glitter in his eye and his skin had a tallowy paleness . The children were quite frightened of him , particularlywhen he told them in a strange chanting voice that in prison he had found ! relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do good was to join the movement of the workers that was going to make the world a fit place for her children to grow up in , he shook his head impatiently . The revolution must he within . lie asked her to pray with him , recited the Lord 's Prayer and left , although it was a dreadfully cold night and she had n't had time to give him money to buy an overcoat , insisting that he was off to take up his ministry . Those years Anne never knew how she kept her head above water , lint she managed to support the children and her mother and to make occasional loans to her sisters who had married impecunious husbands and were usually in financial difficulties , and even to buy herself a small house on the Connecticutshore for the summers . She was always in debt ; bill collectors haunted her door , but whenever everything seemed hopeless she would somehow find an editor who would advanceher expenses to do a series of articles on conditions somewhere . When Carl was home it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the movement . They were known everywhere as Mr. and Mrs. Humphries , but when Anne suggested it might be easier for the children if they really got married , he gave her a frowning look and said the conventions were n't any affair of his . He was growing quite deaf and often for days came and went without seeming toFootnote on Social Consciousness 243p243notice her . When she got up her courage to ask him some question about party work he would look at her blankly and ask , " what party ? " It was only when Hall Bryant or some other sympathizer came to dinner that she ever heard Carl discuss politics , and then it was usually a diatribe about the backslidings of some renegade she did n't know . He suffered a great deal from grippy colds and sore throats . The happiest times were when he 'd go to bed with big volumes of Marx and Engels and let her nurse him . Then his dark eyes would look up at her gratefully out of their bony sockets and he would occasionally talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a boy on the farm in Oklahoma because he was always reading books instead of doing the chores and how his mother taught school and had kept a private savings account that the old man never knew about for him to go away to college on .

" One particularly cold winter he had to he in Pittsburgh a great deal . He wrote to her to send him his heavy coat and then his trunk and his books . Then one evening he came in looking unusually gaunt and ill and said he could n't stay to dinner . He stood in the hall and looked into her face as if he saw what it looked like for once .

Lulie shoved her copy into the drawer of her desk , snatched up Aunt Lyde 's little marten neckpiece she was wearing that winter , pulled the green cloche hat she hated down on her head and ran out of the office . Of course the great I ugh Swanson himself had to be in the elevator . " Jumping the gun ? " he said with the dimpled smile she never quite knew how to take on his face , which Miss Ebbit liked to describe as roughhewn , under the blond beast 's brush of short strawcolored hair .

When the elevator stopped with a leap at the ground floor Lulie let herself slip back among the shoving passengers until the great Hugh Swanson 's broad pleated back had disappeared from view . She was quite out of breath . She was n't crazy about her job , but this was n't the day she wanted to get fired . " Bet myself two to one on this elevator , " said a voice she knew well , only it was deeper and firmer . She spun around.  |p245Georgic  was standing with his back to the marble wall beside the elevator . He held himself straight . He was a Marine Corps lieutenant . She jumped up and down in front of him . " It 's Georgie home from the wars . " " Do n't call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms . She held him off by the shoulders with both gloved hands and examined him carefully . " George Elbert , you 've gotten to be outrageously goodlooking . . . And a mustache , good gracious !

" I never expected to live to see this day . " Hardly knowing where they were going they followed the homeward crowd of clerks and stenographers through the spinningbrassbound doors out into the raging street . Lulie ducked her cloche into the wind and held tight to his arm . " God it 's cold in this man 's town , " Georgie was grumbling . " What I need 's a drink ... " " Uncle Purdy 's expecting me home to entertain some doctors , " Lulie panted . " Could you stand coming out to Woodlawn Park ? " " Was n't it bad enough having to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours ?

You know he did n't even get out of Great Lakes . He 's graduating this spring . " Lulie 's hands were numb in her kid gloves . " Georgie , " she cried asp246they stopped for the traffic at a corner , " we 've got to go someplace . Suppose we go sit in a hotel lobby . " " Let 's take a taxi . " " I have n't a warm dime .

" George Elbert , you knew Zeke got married " Ben wrote me but he did n't say who to . Was it Josephine ? " " No such luck . It 's a horrible little girl he calls Mugsie . I almost cried my eyes out . " " I wish we were all up at the lake . " Georgie 's face went glum again . Lulie darted into the booth , where there lingered a stale smell of cigarette smoke and violet sachet . Lulie 's fingers were so cold she dropped her nickel and had to grope over the gritty floor for it . As soon as she heard Uncle Purdy 's hello she knew it was no use . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whined . " He got a Croix de Guerre . " She did n't listen to what Uncle Purdy was saying . " All right tell Aunt Lyde I 'll be there at quarter of seven , " she answered and hung up .

I 've got a reprieve till quarter of seven and Uncle Purdy and his doctors have to leave right after dinner . They are going to a medical meeting . You come out and eat dinner with Zeke . You 'll want to see Zeke anyway . " " Guess I might as well do that as anything else , " said Georgic in a discouraged tone . " I 've got to kill time somehow until Jasper gets in .

Georgic 's address . when the taxidriver , who was a veteran himself and a Czech and scornful of them Slovenes , managed to find it , after cruising up and clown a distant windswept avenue reverberating with truck traffic under lonesome cold arclights , turned out to be a poolroom full of sallow darkeyed men in turtleneck sweaters .

She giggled timidly . Georgie had found his thug , a stocky customer with gorilla arms and a nose like a turnip , who wore embroidered suspenders and red elastics on his shirtsleeves and rounded on diem scowling when he heard their footsteps on the dancefloor . When he recognized Georgie his lace brightened suddenlywith smiles like a lit jack-o ' - lantern . " Jesus , Mary and Joseph , it 's the loot . " He backed bowing to the wall and switched on all the blue green and yellow lights that dangled from the rafters . He spread out his big strangler 's hands . " What 'll you have , Loot ? It 's all on the house . " " Steve , this is the nicest girl in the world . Lulie , Steve was my topkick. "  |p248Steve  kissed Lulie 's hand like a grand duke .

Lulie just tasted hers and let Georgie drink it . He tossed it off like an old hand . Steve himself carried the gallon jug all neatly cartoned and labelled tuna fish out to the taxi . " Fiftytwo Ten Allerton Avenue , " Lulie said to the taxidriver . " Well Georgic if you have n't made yourself a place in the world . " She threw herself back in the seat and laughed comfortably . " In the underworld , " said Georgie . " Tell me how 's Aunt Lyde ? I always thought the world of Aunt Lyde , " he added . " She 's no better really . She does n't leave her room much .. .

It was fun being out with this new grownup authoritative Georgie .

" " Georgie do you remember . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the snow of the driveway at Fifty two hen . Lulie 's heart sank down into her stomach when she saw , beyond the dark cars parked in the drive , the light Trickling out over the iced barberry bushes and shadows moving across the shades drawn down on the livingroom windows ; Uncle Purdy and his guests standing around waiting for her to entertain them . From Aunt Lyde 's room upstairs a low glow oozed through the venetian blinds . Immediately ladle could see in her head Aunt Lyde 's pompadourcatching the light and Mrs. Ritchie 's dumpy figure in her white dress reading The Inside of the Cup in a monotonousvoice . A tall shadow moved across the unshaded light in the apartment over the garage . Zeke was home . Her voice was so weak it sounded like a furtive little whisper in her own ears when Georgie turned towards her after paying the taxidriver : " Let 's go see Zeke first . " Her hands cold with dread , Lulie ran up the steep stairs with Georgie pounding at her heels . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stumbled throughp251the door into the wide bare brightly lit room . " Zeke look what I found . " Zeke glanced up questioningly at her from under his green eyeshade . He was in his shirtsleeves leaning over a draftsman 's table lit by a single enormous electric light bulb . At the other end of the table snubnosed Mugsie with a broad pink ribbon tied round her pale hair , backing and squinting as if she were painting a picture , was arranging paper carnationsin a bowl . " Lulie , we 're working , " Zeke started to say . Lulie interruptedhim : " Zeke it 's George Elbert home from the wars . " " Welcome to our city , Georgie , " said Zeke abstractedly moving his rule and standing with poised pencil over some shading on his drawing . " I 'll be with you in three shakes . " " Well I 've got to scamper , " said Lulie in a hurry . " You 'll feed George Elbert wo n't you Zeke ? Juliet this is Lieutenant Warner an old crony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnations . " I 'll be back when I 've polished off the sawbones . " Lulie gave one last glance around before she snapped out the door . Georgie , the old sullen injured look on his face and that curl she had never liked to his lips under the smart mustache , with a twist of slim hips was setting down the heavy carton with the wine in it he 'd brought up the stairs on his shoulder . Zeke was tracing a last fine line on his elevation of a school building with his mouth pursed up . Mugsie with a rapt look was poking a paper carnation into a bowl and chanting : " He 'll help us do the dishes now wo n't he ? Marines are always so helpful . " Poor Georgie , thought Lulie as she ran across to the back door of the house , he deserves a cheerfuller homecoming . But she did n't have time to think how terrible everything was at Fiftytwo Ten she was in such a scamper with all she had to do . She had to comb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de chine dinner dress and the highheeled slippers that hurt her toes . She had to take up Aunt Lyde 's and Mrs. Ritchie 's traysp252that black Emma had ready on the pantry shelf . She had to run out among her uncle 's guests with plates of canapes and to say something cute to each one . They were all soggily sippinglittle glasses of grapejuice because Uncle Purdy never would serve anything that was against the law . They seemed nice enough middleaged men hut she could n't talk to them because she had to go out to the kitchen again to make sure Emma was n't letting the rolls burn , and there was the gravy to make . Emma never would make the gravy , always said Miss Lulie ought to keep her hand in on it . Then Lulie had to sit at one end of the heavy golden oak dining table to serve the mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts while Uncle Purdy ponderouslycarved the leg of lamb at the other end . At last she was left alone with the livingroom chintz and the grounds in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop into the armchair by the fireplace and lay back listening to the cars starting and grinding away through the icy ruts outside . Then she jumped up and ran around the room kicking up her heels and clumping out the host of little ashtrays into the big brass one . She carried that out to the kitchen and stood there a moment beside Emma , who was deep in sudsy dishwater , to hear the latest news of Ennna 's husband , the elder Broadwater who aspired to be a preacher and suffered a call from on high that took him away from house whenever Emma needed money to buy something for the children . Emma was still going on in a complainingsingsong about the elder when ladle ran off up the back stairs to Aunt Cycle 's room . As she gently pushed open the door Mrs. Ritchie 's rumbling voice stopped reading . Her dark round eyes looked up from the book . Her dark thick brows rose . Aunt Lyde opened her eyes and gave Lulie a gray querulous look : " My dear do n't interrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pillow up a little Mrs. Ritche looked up at her over the top of the book and said in her deep voice , that caused Lulie and the boys among them/selves to call her the lady baritone : " We 're so interested , " she said , " we ca n't wait to get to the next chapter . " " I 'm running over to Zeke 's for a moment . I just wanted you to know where I was . " " You should n't have stayed on my account , " said Aunt Lyde . " We forget everything , " said Mrs. Ritchie emphatically , " absolutely everything when we get into a really interesting story , do n't we Mrs. Rumford ? How do they manage to make life so interesting in books ? " Lulie stopped a second in her own room to tidy her hair up and to put on a little powder on her face . " Now do n't be small about Mrs. Ritchie , " she told her own face in the mirror . Mrs. Ritchie was a treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to make everything so lugubrious ? Climbing the narrow stairs to Zeke 's place above the garage Lulie felt the old apprehension as she looked up at the blank door . It sounded mighty quiet up there . The moment her hand turned the knob she began to hear Mugsie 's high childish voice intoningthat she was a free spirit and that marriage to anyone but another free spirit would have been a desecration . Lulie had to force herself to open the door . Zeke was still at work ; his long thin white face was in shadow as he leaned over his drafting table . Georgie looked wretched sitting opposite Mugsie at a cardtable where cheese and ryebread and bologna sausage were piled up on the wrappings they had come from the delicatessen in . His tunic was unbuttoned . With pursed lips and frowning brows he was cleaning the Luger that was Zeke 's souvenir of the war . The parts were laid out on a piece of oiled paper in front of him , between a paper cup of wine and a can of three-in-one oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lipschitz , with just the slits of her eyes and her high cheekbones catching the light . The recumbent form behind her turned out to be Harding Edwards in a yellow necktie . She and Zeke told each other everything , Mugsie was chant/ing as Lulie stepped shamefacedly into the circle of light . They had determined to leave each other absolutely free , only they were going to be honest and tell each other everything . Of course she knew ( she tittered a little ) that Zeke was a genius and a genius could n't live like an ordinary person , but people had told her she was a genius too . People had told her she had a genius for living . She gave her head a little toss . Lulie felt whatever she had to say dry up in her throat . " Significance , " said Olga in her deep voice with its teasing foreign accent and rolled her eyes towards Zeke 's profile . " The creative spirit must signify . " Harding Edwards lifted his curly head on his hand , " Les pclites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he recited and let . his head sink back on the pillow behind Olga . " You know I 've forgotten my Latin , " said Mugsie . Her face sharpened into a spiteful beak towards Harding and Olga . " He just said it to make me feel uneducated , " she whispered . " The little marionettes , my dear Moogsie " ; Olga stretched out her hand in a gesture out of grand opera . " Life is a stage where the marionettes perform three little acts and then they are gone . " She pulled out her cheeks and blew as if blowing out a match . Georgie snapped the last part back into the Luger and got to his feet . " Bullshit , " he roared . Mugsie turned on hint now , blubbering that he might be an officer but he was no gentleman . Paying no attention Georgic aimed at an imaginary target outside the window and squeezed the trigger . " It has damn good action Zeke , if you 'd only take care of it . " " But Mugsie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under his eyeshade , " you told us we had to be honest and say what we thought . "  | " Why Zeke Harrington , " shouted Lulie laughing without feeling amused , " If people said what they thought the world would be a shambles . " She restrained an impulse to let herselfgo off into a fit of shrieking hysterics . Georgie was packing his gallon of wine back into its carton again ; needed it for Jasper he explained . Lulie helped him with the string . As they went down the stairs Lulie whined unhappily in his ear that Mugsie was not only boring herself but caused others to become boring . . . " But she may be right about Zeke . He took all the honors in his architecture course , and now down at Zimmer and Field they are just crazy about him . " Lulie prayed every night , she added laughing , he 'd get the Prix de Rome and take Mugsie over to Europe with him and never bring her back . " I could strangle that girl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the lake but we did n't talk anybody 's ear off about it , " grumbled Georgie . " If I 'd known things would be like this I swear I 'd have stayed in the Marine Corps . We 've got prohibition and we 've got Mugsie and Zeke 's turned out a bloody genius on us . What a way to come home ! " Lulie walked out with Georgie to the end of the drive and watched him go trudging off with the carton on his shoulder towards the carstop . When she got back there was snow in her slippers and her feet were wet . She ran upstairs and threw off the soggy slippers and dried her stockings in front of the gaslogsin Aunt Lyde 's room . Mrs. Ritchie had turned in . It was time to tuck Aunt Lyde into bed for the night . Aunt Lyde looked very pretty with her thin ivory face and her wave of white hair pressed against the pillows . She was in one of her well spells . When she started complaining that nobody ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgie had wanted to because he thought the world of her . She was the first one he 'd asked about . Aunt Lyde answered that she thought very little of Georgie but maybe he 'd improved . Why Aunt Lyde , Lulie declared , he 'd grown up to be the handsomestyoung man you ever saw.  | " It 's the uniform , " and Aunt Lyde , nodding her head ... . When she had been a girl in Washington , Aunt Lyde went on . . . Lulie knew that her father , that was Lulie 's GrandfatherWaring , had served a two year term in the Senate , from Kentucky of course . " My dear , that was where your mother met your father . He was the handsomest young professor I ever saw but no handsomer than one other . . . He wore a uniform . I have his picture still . I must think where it is . " She touched her temples with her transparent white hands . " Put a little cologne on Aunt Lyde 's forehead dearest . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls . It was a continual whirl . . . balls at the embassies . . . affairs at the Arlington . We all get our looks from the Warings . The looks were n't on the distaff side . Your dear grandmother was famous for her wit , but she was never a beauty . Oh Lulie it 's so dreadful when your memory fails . Where could I have met him . . . at some embassy , we even went to the White House ... and yet I sec him as plainly as if he were in the room .. . in a blue uniform with red stripes on his pantaloons . We rode out daily and this handsome French officer often accompanied us . That was before I met Joe Addison , my first husband .. . In some ways lathe I 've had a strange and tragic life . You know he was killed in a hunting accident . They brought him home bleeding . I lc died in my arms . If he had lived things would have been different for you and your brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But your Uncle Purdy and I had several happy years . Childlessness is tragic . He was full of fun as a young mul , but as men grow old the fun leaves them and all they can think of is business . Lulie dear , look under the paisley shawl iii the lower drawer . See if you ca n't find his picture , not Purdy 's dear , Colonel Jusserand 's . It 's in a little leather case . Father ; your grandfather , Senator Waring ... Sometimes I think Zeke resembles him ; something about the eyes . . . Father never knew I kept his picture all these years . Of course I should have returned it . You would neverp257think your dear grandmother had been the wife of a United States Senator , would you ? Of course he was only appointed to fill an unexpired term when Senator Philpotts died . Your grandfather would never have been selected by the legislature , he was far too plainspoken . He was quite a philosopher , that 's why he liked the professor . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored people just worshiped him . We girls loved old Terence . I can remember his wooly white sideburns . We spent a great deal of time together : your father the professor , and this French colonel  --  everybody said he looked too young to be a colonel  --  and your dear mother .. . we enjoyed simple pleasures then . . . riding out to the old mill on Rock Creek . It was farms and pastures in those days . It must have been later the District took it tor a park . Sometimes the water was up above the horses ' knees . I can see him now riding ahead through the ford with his gloves in his hand and a way he had of cocking his head to one side . Zeke 's getting to do that . . . He 's such a goodlooking boy I hope he does n't get conceited . Your mother and I were dreadfulteases . Oh how we used to tease conceited young men , practical jokes and everything . . . We were quite scamps I fear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the scarves and laces that smelt of lavender . Her hand struck something square . " Why Aunt Lyde , your memory is perfect . " She brought the case out to the light and opened it . Inside was a daguerreotype of a thoughtful looking man with large dark eyes and drooping mustache . He wore epaulettes and much frogging on his uniform . The head did have a little tilt to one side . When she looked at it Aunt Lyde began to cry . " Father forbade him the house . " . Lulie brought her a lace handkerchief . Aunt Lyde patted her reddening eyes with it . " Oh dear , this 'll make my head ache . Lulie dear get me a little aromatic spirits of ammonia . "  |p258Lulie  came back from the bathroom with an opaque liquid in the bottom of a tumbler . Aunt Lyde drank it and closed her eyes and let her head drop hack against the pillow . " He discovered . . . " she went on with her eyes closed ;  --  " you know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were much worse gossips than women . . . that poor Colonel Jusserandwas involved with some awful woman . There were shameless creatures in Washington even in those days ... and he made him understand that he should never darken our door again . Your poor mother and I cried our eyes out because it broke up our riding parties , but by that time your father and Sister Lucy were married so they did n't need a chaperon . I used to see him at balls and on the street . He 'd take off his hat so sadly . You ca n't tell by the silly oldfashioned picture that he had brown eyes . Your mother used to say there was doglike devotion in those brown eyes when he saw me . She used to tease me dreadfully about him . " " Georgic has too . . . I do n't know if I like men with dog 's eyes , " sail Lulie yawning . She looked up at Aunt Lyde 's little travelling clock on the bureau . " Aunt Lyde it 's a quarter past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sha n't sleep a wink the way I feel now . " " It 'll have to be a short one , " said Lulie and picked up the book . She had n't read two pages before she noticed Aunt Lyde was asleep . She lit the nightlight on the washstand , opened the window a crack , turned out the electric light and tiptoed into her own room . It seemed to her that : she had barely laid her face on the pillow before the awful old alarmclock was ringing in her ears . She was horribly sleepy but she got herself dressed and washed somehow and gulped a bowl of dry cereal in the kitchen , and ran out the door at a quarter of eight as she always did to catch the streetcar at the corner that trundled her to the elevated where she waited stiff with cold in thep259drowsy early morning crowd for the train that took her to the familiar ads of her station in the Loop and to the struggle through the hurrying crowds in the canyon that howled betweenskyscrapers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the swoop up in the brass elevator ; there were the goodmornings in the reception room on her way to her desk and she was sitting there with the brassbound clock staring down from the wall above . That morning she found a typed interoffice communication on the blotter : Miss Harringtonwill please call Mr. Swanson . Fired bejabers , Lulie said to herself , but it was n't that at all . The great Hugh Swanson 's voice was crisp but kind . Lunch next Wednesday at twelve sharp . An account he wanted to discuss with her alone . " Mr Swanson , could n't you tell me which one ? I could be researching it a bit . " The account had n't reached that stage . He wanted her intuitive grasp . It had come on him like a flash when he saw her in the elevator . His decisions were highly intuitive . Of course she 'd be delighted , said Lulie , but her voice did n't sound right in her ears . Miss Ebbitt looking cold and tall as an icicle in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrington it 's about your copy for Bonmeyer 's . Are n't you being a little too clever ? I loved it . I read it over to Mr. Swanson and he laughed out loud . He 's just a boy at heart you know . But we must n't forgetthat the people who 'll read it are n't a bit clever . They 'll think you 're spoofing them . " Miss Ebbitt made a disdainful little round mouth when she said the word spoofing . ' " The public does n't like to be spoofed . " She sat down beside Lulie and set the typewritten sheet down on the desk and with her sharp little pencil took all the fun out of the day . Lulie could hear behind Miss Ebbitt 's precise little voice her aunt 's voice saying " As men grow old the fun leaves them " and she could see her Uncle Purdy exploding his funless jokes at the end of the table while he ponderously dealt out roast Iamb to thep260director of the hospital he hoped to sell his enamelled bedpansto . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was the fun going out of Joe Newcomer , she thought with inner panic as she met him in the lobby downstairs in the milling crowd that Saturday at noon just in time to hurry out to lunch . But Decent Respectable had always been stolid and staid . As they ate she was busy telling him how much the Marines had done for Georgie and how Ben would be home for the weekend and how Georgie 's thugs were going to set the whole Tribe up to a beefsteak dinner that night and it was way over on the South Side and Georgie had sworn his thugs would n't let anybody get held up but she admitted she was a bit nervous about going . " I ought to be tickled to death , " Joe said , " but we have the future to think of . I 'd like to take you out alone . There is so much I want to talk about . " The future . The word gave Lulie a chill . All at once she saw herself businesslike and icy like Miss Ebbitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil . " Decent Respectable , you promised . " She looked up at him pleadingly across the little marble table in the restaurant that smelt of hot chocolate and patties . " What ( lid I promise , Lulie ? " " You would n't try to make me grow up too soon . " " It 's a hard promise to keep . We have to face the future . The business boomed all the time I was overseas , naturally , war orders , but now that I 'm back Dad wants me to take over and we 're facing a slump . We 've got to pull in our horns a little . I may not be able to take this long drive every weekend . It 's going to be heavy sledding for a few weeks . If I had you with me I know I 'd make the grade . " His voice got very husky . She was almost crying . " Joe you make me feel so horrid . I do n't want to be horrid . I 'm not horrid . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . " Lulie I do n't want to make you feel bad . "  | " Of course you do n't , Decent Respectable . Let 's have fun today . Like we used to at the lake . " The game was at two . Decent Respectable had thought of everything . He had the tickets and two plaid rugs in his car and a thermos of hot coffee . Waiting for the game to start they shivered on the hard seats , in the sunlight cold as brass under a slaty sky streaked with marestails , but once the whistle blew the game kept their blood moving , and the crowds and the cheering and the shock of bodies as tiny squareshouldered bulletheaded figures hurtled in changing formations across the distant muddy field below them . " Talk about fun , " said Joe suddenly as they stood up between the halves stomping like Indians with their rugs about their shoulders while the cheerleaders far below made agile elastic x 's in front of ranked young throats roaring in unison . " I think business is the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Uncle Purdy has taken the fun out of it for me , or maybe Miss Ebbitt . " " I 've got a good team Lillie but I need the right cheering section . " " But Joe you can have anything you want . " " Except what I want most . " " Joe you 're such a dandy . " " And they praised him to his face , " quoted Joe , " With their stately Spanish grace . " " Oh Joe you remember it . Do you remember the summer when Father made little Ben learn the whole of it and he recitedit all over the lake ? I was just happy all day long . " The whistle blew . The teams trotted out on the field again . " We still have Wildfowl , " Joe said as they worked their way after the game down the concrete steps through the rollicking redfaced crowd toward the back lot where they had parked the car . " And the lake 's still there , " said Lulie . Feeling windblownand boisterous they drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterglow . Once they got out ofp262the parade of packed cars starting and stopping from the footballgame Joe wove deftly through the traffic . Decent Respectablewas a good driver . His Dodge touring car had a wonderful pickup . At cross streets where they waited in a row of panting puffing cars Lulie would cry , " Beat ' em to the start Barney Oldfield , " and pretend to shake her fist at the other drivers . Overhead electric light signs sparkled against the darkening sky . Saturday evening throngs overflowed the downtown sidewalks . By the time they got to Steve 's place their cheeks were burning from the cold . They agreed they were beefsteak hungry . Beating their hands together to get the blood into their fingers they hurried through the grimed poolparlor . From out back came the sound of an accordion playing " From the Halls of Montezuma . " The dancehall looked bright with colored lights and paper streamers and fresh tablecloths for Saturday night . The first thing they saw was Georgie and Jasper erect in their uniforms each with its spectrum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of bottles . Around them per ( lied at a respectful distance on the edges of their chairs , Lulie right away recognized Georgie 's thugs through their storeclothes . Ben was there too looking very collegiate , an expression of adoration on his childish face . As soon as Lulie sat down a thick beefsteak stacked with frenchfriedonions and fried potatoes appeared at every place . She 'd hardly had a chance to be introduced to the nearest of the thugs or to say hello to Jasper and Ben or to pop a slice of steak into her mouth when Georgie in a peremptory sort of way asked her to dance . The popeyed fat man who played the accordion on the platform behind them had been joined by a skinny pianist and a hollowcheeked citizen with a violin . They struck up " Tipperary " as she followed Georgie 's broad shoulders out onto the floor . " I declare George Elbert , " she was saying after they 'd taken a few steps , " the Marines must even furnish dancing lessons . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's seen so many good men killed lie does n't wait around . He goes out and gets what he wants , " said Georgie clipping the ends of his words . " I 've gone and gotten myself a job . " " Go on . " " Bugs Stoddard down at the Standard turns out to be an exMarineso I go down to see him and he hires me . I go to work Monday morning because it 's an evening paper . You better watch your manners , young woman . You are dancing with a cub reporter . " " George Elbert , you 're wonderful . " " Here 's our pet genius , " Georgie 's lips under his mustache gave that curl she hated so , " and his seven pretty attendants . " Zeke , tall and stoopshouldered and absentminded , was being steered round the edges of the dancefloor by Mugsie , in a baby blue organdy stiff with ruffles , and Olga who was dressed like a gangster 's moll in a movie in dark sweater and mannish jacket . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stony look of a marble fawn . Joe Newcomer was on his feet making the introductions and finding people chairs , they noticed as they swept past . " The cleancut young executive , " said Georgie out of the corner of his mouth . " That 's the citizen tried to drown me . " Lulie made out that was a great joke , but underneath she knew it was not any joke to Georgic . The thought gave her a sick unhappy feeling . The music had stopped . The floor was slippery from fresh wax . They slid back towards the table . Lulie had barely started on her steak again when Jasper was bowing stiffly in her direction . Jasper was silent as ever , except when Lulie asked him what he thought about Georgie 's job ; then he began to talk . " Right thing . The boy 's got the brains . He learned more in the war , book learning too , than the average feller 'll learn in four years of college . He 'd be thrown away on a ranch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I 'd have to go to work sweeping out a flourmill. "  | " I like to think of us all riding the range , " Lulie whispered . " Give George and me a few years to pick up some jack . The trouble with me is I 'm not like George , I do n't educate easy .. . I 'm like General Grant 's Missouri mule that went through the Civil War . He was a mule when he went in and a mule when he came out . " Jasper fastened up his mouth after that and she could n't get him to say another word . Lulie was hungry but she never did get any more steak because the band did n't stop playing once and one of the boys was always waiting to dance with her when she got back to the table . When she danced with Zeke she noticed he had that cold tense look on his face he always had when he wanted to say something he thought was important . " Sister Lucy , " he said abruptly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pretty worthless object . I want you all to understand that I have taken on a sacred trust . " " Of course we understand , " said Lulie but the words did n't sound right in her ears . Harding Edwards cut in . He held her timidly and his hands felt weak and damp but he had a perfect sense of time . " I know Zeke does n't like to dance with his sister , " he explained tittering . " He says it 's incestuous . . . I 'm kind of neutral , not being a member of the family or anything . " He gave the word " anything " an odd accent : that embarrassed Lulie . " You know I 'd walk into a fiery furnace for Zeke . You know that Lulie .. . I 'm really worried . I ca n't sleep nights for worrying . Do you suppose she could really be crazy ? You know who I mean . She 's looking at us now . I do wish somebody would dance with her . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiggles her hips . . . There ca n't be any mental stimulus in that for Zeke now can there ? Marriage or any other relationship betweenpeople ca n't be purely carnal , now can it Lulie ? That 's why he has to spend so much time with Olga and me . We stimulate hint . A creative artist needs stimulus . " " Zeke always says every human being is worth as much asp265every other human being . He calls it the theory of equivalent values . You know how fanatical he is about his theories . " " He 's trying to make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear . " Hardingthrew back his head with a tinny laugh . " And I do n't mean I do n't like her . I do like her . . . Lulie you were a darling to let me dance with you , " he said when the music stopped . Lookingback in her face with wide unlit eyes he slid away among the dispersing couples . Steve in blue serge with pinstripes was bowing from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Excuse me if I dance with you " Beautiful Blue Danube " . . . I order it special . I like to honor pretty lady . . . Will you excuse ? . . . I talk Montenegran goddam good . In Montenegran I can talk to King or Queen of Italia . Italian pretty good , Deutsch a little bit , but American I talk like goddam bum . " He waltzed smoothly , holding her out respectfully at the end of his long arms . " Captain Milliron my big boss , a man like king . Best goddam officer in Marine Corps . The loot small boss , good hunter . Together we hunt plenty Boche . . . Back in Chicago . Chicago tough town . Me boss . My joint . Make plenty politics . In precint one little king . " Lulie found herself bowing in a courtly way towards him as they spun . His face creased up with smiles . " Your fader alive ? " " No , " said Lulie . " Who head de family ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . " You give me address . I go to see im like friend , like American citizen . Tell him he give you to loot . A beeg man like that need nice wife , plenty baby . " " But suppose I do n't want to get married ? " asked Lulie laughing harder than ever . " Captain maybe , " said Steve . " Captain not afraid of goddam thing . " The waltz stopped . Steve bowed again from the waist . " Your uncle . He understand , " he said.  |p266Georgie  was edging his way towards them . Steve spread out his long arms to make way for him . " Excuse it , Loot , " he said . " I make special waltz in honor pretty lady . She like girl in my country , goddam beautiful and wild like a bird . In Montenegro de most beautiful girl in the world , goddam it to hell . De King of Italia leetle man but goddam wise . He know . He pick Montenegran girl . " Lulie and Georgie went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character , George Elbert . He worships the ground you walk on . " " I thought you 'd like my thugs . " They got to laughing and could n't stop laughing . Other couples gave them sidelong looks as they danced around laughing . " George Elbert , I 'm quite giddy , " said Lulie . " Little squaw drink plenty firewater ? " asked Georgie . " I have n't had a chance to , I 've been dancing so hard . Some nights the world seems wonderfully wild . " Georgie 's face had taken on that black sullen look : " Wonderfullywild . You would have thought so overseas , seeing the good guys get killed . " " You and Jasper came out of it . " " Jasper got wounded just before Belleau Wood or he 'd have been a gone gosling , the way he exposed himself . " " Tell me about it . " " Not now , " said Elbert scowling ' . " Say whatever happened to Joe Sawbuck and his ballteam ? " " Joe got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She remembered the unwashed smell of stale woodsmoke and kerosene lamps Joe Sawbuck always had . Dancing with Georgie she felt all at once very far away . She was having that feeling she sometimes had way down that she was n't there at all . Up at the lake maybe . Really she was standing by a campfirelike the time they 'd all gone camping up Runaway River and Father and his friends the Spingarns and the Willard girlsp267had gone along . with tents and primes stoves and a fleet of canoes , she could n't remember whether Georgie had been along or not but there had been Northern Lights while they were cooking supper , great pale half invisible curtains flapping in the north and now the sparks of the campfire were melting into the stars and the firs stood around like wigwams of a sleepingtribe and Father and Professor Spingarn had talked about the journeys of the first voyageurs through the great forest and Zeke had piped up and said , " Why ca n't we still do it ? " and all at once she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all first growth forest and plains full of bison and antelope and wildcat and lynx and the timber wolves howling , and trout in the rivers and woodcock and quail thick like Grandmother Waring used to tell about when she was a girl . In the smell of balsam and the crackling birch twigs and the soft feel of the moss underfoot she 'd felt there was nothing that mattered in the world but the wilderness stretching behind her endless into the enormous north . " A penny for your thoughts , " said Georgie . " George Elbert , do n't give up your ranch . We mus n't let them coop us all up . " " How about you ? " " I 'll spring the latch . " " We 've got to get hold of something to use for money , Lulie . They charge money for everything in this man 's country .. . What the hell ? " Georgie had stopped in his tracks and was looking over his shoulder . Lulie looked where he was looking . The group sitting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spiteful beaked expression on her face , was saying something disagreeable to Olga . Upsetting bottles and tumblers she lunged across the table with one hand and slapped Olga 's face . The slap resounded . Olga 's mouth was open round and her face twisted up like a child 's who is going to cry . The tableau melted into action as Joe Newcomer and I-larding with the anxious expressions of referees at a prizefightp268rose up between them . Then Zeke , with that look on his face of impersonal curiosity Lulie found so maddening , was leading Mugsie away blubbering and stumbling inside of her blue organdy . Right away Lulie decided she did n't want to hear the explanations . She stood behind Joe Newcomer plucking at his sleeve . " Let 's us go , " she said . " Decent Respectable , " she went on when they were safe out in the chill darkness of the open touring car , " it was just like Cinderella . . . I had been having such a good time dancing with the boys and dreaming about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach was an old rotten pumpkin and bats and owls flew out . " " Zeke has a tough row to hoe . " Joe said pausing between his words . " Why in the world did he do it ? Zeke 's the brightest of any of us . " Lulie did n't answer . Yawning she pulled her head as far as it would go into the collar of the rabbitskin coat she 'd never liked but that had been the only one she could afford now that she was n't getting any allowance since Father died . " Sorry , " she said , " but I 'm so sleepy . " " I guess I ought n't to have taken you to a joint like that , " Joe went on . Lulie could only give a drowsy groan . When they drove in at Fiftytwo Ten Lulie 's eyes were blind with sleep . Yawning she showed Joe where the couch had been made up for him in the den and whispered that Ben would find cots for Jasper and Georgie in the attic . Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three quick little pats on the shoulder and ran off into Aunt Lyde 's room . She found Aunt Lyde wide awake . " Where 's Ben ? " was the first thing Aunt Lyde asked . " Why has n't he come in ? " " Joe brought me home early because I danced myself into fits and suddenly felt tired as a worm . " " My dear you are reeking of tobacco . That 's the worst thing about going out with men . The smell gets in your hair . Ifp269you 're not careful you 'll ruin your complexion . And I dedareyou have rings under your eyes . . . at your age . Sister Lucy and I used to think buttermilk was the best thing in the world for the complexion . Now I wo n't sleep a wink till Ben comes in . " " But Aunt Lyde . Ben 's free white and twentyone . He 's out with his best and oldest friends . Zeke 's along . " " If Zeke had any common sense he 'd never have made such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't marry at all . Most girls would have jumped at Joe Newcomer . I know you always think he 's there to fall back on but you ca n't keep him dangling forever . You 'll see . You always think you can do the impossible like all the Harringtons . People who try for the impossible take a fall sooner or later , do n't forget that dear . . . Read me a chapter Lulie dear . It 's the only thing that soothes me . My blood pressure 's up tonight . I can feel it throbbing in my temples . If things go on like this , " she began to whimper , " I 'll worry myself into a shock . " Fighting back her yawns , Lulie started to read . The words swam before her eyes . Aunt Lyde was n't paying attention . She was talking again . " My dear , sometimes I wonder why any woman marries , any woman who respects herself . Now with Joe Addison if he 'd lived I would have been happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never entered our bedroom without knocking . In those days married couples were supposed to sleep in double beds but he showed such delicacy . . . Your Uncle Purdy and I have always had separate rooms . My dear I declare he married me for my social position or he thought there was more money than appeared on the surface , but all poor Joe Addison left after the debts were paid was an exquisite set of flat silver and some old trunks full of his mother 's crinolines , and Grandfather Waring squandered everything on his horses . Luckily he did n't live to see Sandy Ford go under the hammer . . . Of course the old mansion had burned years before . . . When your Uncle Purdyp70came along there was no choice . The strain of these years has broken my health , and worrying about the future of you children . Your father was so impractical . He never would come down to earth . My dear , in his will he left everything to me and Purdy to hold in trust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the strength to oppose Purdy . The Harringtons always think everything 's going to turn out the way they want and of course it does n't . I 'm worrying myself into the grave about it . He 'll be glad when I 'm gone . You 'll all be glad . " .. . She sniffed " I 'm such a trouble and expense to you all . . . An unsuitable marriage is so degrading for a lady . " She started sobbing again . " My dear , he 's made me sign things . . . It 's not right for him to invest you children 's inheritance in his own business . I declare I ca n't bear men . " Lulie went to the bureau and shook one of the sleeping capsules out of its bottle . Aunt Lyde put it on her tongue obediently as a child and took a dutiful little swallow after it . She closed her eyes . Right away she was asleep . Lulie was wide awake by this time . She locked herself in her room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was a little girl until she felt herself slipping back happily into a dreamlit world of castles and forests . Dreaming she was clothed in white samite walking through a glen dark with great hemlock trees she fell asleep . Of course she had to wake up with the curse the morning of the day she had to lunch with the great Hugh Swanson . She arrived at the office with a headache feeling peaked and pale , and sat at her desk toying ; bitterly with the proof of Bonmeyer 's page of dainty lingeries . The thought of soft lawns and muslins put her teeth on edge like the screech of chalk on a blackboard ; she wished she was a nun in sackcloth and a starched coif . The brassbound clock counted the minutes ever so slowly . She was n't scared of Hugh Swanson , she was telling herself but she wished the lunch were over ; she ought to have called up to say she was home sick . Suddenly she looked up and thep271hands on the clock were pointing straight up and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dreaming of lovely lingeries ? Not too bad for next week , eh ? A cut of a pretty girl dreaming over Bonmeyer 's ad , but can we get an artist to put the reverie into it ? " " It makes me want to wear oilskins . " She put a comical wail into her voice as she got to her feet . " Mr. Swanson I 'll be with you in two seconds . " As she dashed off to the ladies ' room she saw all sorts of expressions chasing each other across Hugh Swanson 's broad pale face . By the time she got back with her hat and fur jacket on he had evidently decided to be amused and a little wistful . " There are times , " he said , after a glance around the marble landing where they were waiting for the elevator , to make sure no other employee was within earshot , " when I want to go up to the rooftops and announce to the world in a loud voice that nothing matters but a few simple honest things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the look , Lulie whispered to herself , it must wear when he went to his banker for a loan . " That does n't mean I do n't like clothes , " said Lulie . " Of course , of course , " he said soothingly in the cab that was taking them to the restaurant . " But that 's why I want your advice , Miss Harrington . You 're as independent as a hog on ice , as they say in the Loop . " " I hope I have n't been making too much noise in the office , " Lulie said laughing . " Miss Ebbitt says she 's getting a cloth to cover my cage . " " Miss Ebbitt is a very fine lady . " " And a very smart one , " said Lulie . As they walked into the restaurant across from the courthousewith its dim gilded mirrors and its smell of Vienna pastry and cigarettes , the great Hugh Swanson seemed to swell inside his cashmere overcoat . He knew everybody . Big faces of businessmenand courthouse politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shake hands with him as he passed.  |p272Lulie  felt like the little mouse in the fable trotting in front of the big lion . She understood suddenly what being a lion meant . Hugh Swanson 's face looked like a lion 's ; he was colored like a lion , a tame lion . When he sat down at a table marked RESERVED the waiter was all attention . Hugh Swanson frowned peevishly as he studied the bill of fare . Lulie did n't feel a bit like eating . She ordered a chicken patty and a cup of tea and settled back in her chair ready to enjoy the lunch in spite of everything . She did n't care about his old job , she told herself . Hildegarde Willard had a friend who was starting a new agency . It was n't the only job in town . " Miss Harrington , " began the great Hugh Swanson , breakinga breadstick precisely in the middle , " let me put my cards on the table . As you know I 'm not a conventional person and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business depends on people 's using their brains , their wit , their imagination . Brains do n't flourish in an atmosphere of . . . oh Lord you know the average employee 's attitude towards the boss . That 's why I find certain people so refreshing . " " Certain people better be careful or they 'll turn out silly little chatterboxes . " " Miss Harrington you 've proved to my satisfaction at least that you can deliver the copy . I do n't mind people 's being amusing if they can deliver but I have many amusing friends in this business that ca n't meet a deadline . " Lulie was sipping her tea . " When gentlefolk meet , complimentspass , is what my grandmother would have said . " The great Hugh Swanson picked a carrot off a plate of raw vegetables . He was smiling at her his broadest bigbrotherly smile . His voice became confidential , meringue over chocolate mousse . " I 'm transferring the agency to New York , " he said crunching on the carrot . . . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ca n't abide coffee . . . I 'm reorganizing the firm and reorganizing my private life . We 're seeing the dawn of ap273bigger better brighter more prosperous America . There 's a new spirit in business . We must learn the European lesson . We must give up our landlocked middlewestern outlook or we 'll be left behind in the race . Since the European war Americanprosperity takes on a worldwide significance . " " But I 'm landlocked , " said Lulie with a little shriek of mirth . " I 'm landlocked as a trout . I 've never really seen the ocean though I was taken to California once . I was too little to appreciate it , so my Aunt Lyde said . " " Some people , " said the great Hugh Swanson weightily , " are born with a cosmopolitan outlook . " Lulie heard herself give a sort of gurgle . " Do n't think , Miss Harrington , I 'm selling Chicago short . Chicago made me what I am . I shall always boost Chicago . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . Now my dear . . . I understand they call you Lucy , or Lulie , or something like that . . . EverythingI am saying will be held in the strictest confidence of course . " Lulie nodded eagerly , too eagerly she feared . " My wife has consented to divorce me and to go back to her home and her folks at Red River Junction , to the beginnings from which we sprung . " Lulie tried to keep her mouth from falling open . She knew that disappointment and dismay were showing on her face . " My success has always embarrassed her , " Hugh Swanson went on blandly . " She will be amply provided for . She 's a very fine woman and I shall revere her to my dying day but it is the parting of the ways . She 's always hated it in Chicago and the idea of New York appalls her . Now that the children are of college age she 's planning to go back to teachingschool . In any other kind of people our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us it 's merely that we have reached a crossroads in our lives . Do you follow me ? " , Before Lulie , who was quite out of breath , could answer he went on frowning , " No I prefer for you not to say a word . Think over what I am going to say for three weeks . It 's partlyp274a business proposition but there are other factors involved .. . I want you and of course Frank Hays and Miss Ebbitt and a few others to come to New York with the agency . We 'll make the move some time in the summer . . . But . . . now this particularly I want you to think over carefully . . . I want you , when the divorce proceedings are completed  --  that goes withoutsaying  --  to become my fiancee and eventually my wife . " " But I 'm engaged already , " Lulie said in a thin wail . He showed no signs of having heard . His big pale lion face hovered implausible as a balloon over his plate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feelings that have brought about this proposal , " lie went on in a matter of fact tone . " An engagement can always be broken ... And now , " he added with the expression of a man pressing a button on his desk to usher in a new appointment . . . " I want your ideas as to how we can dramatize the Archer Roller Bearing . I want the women of the family to think of it as a beautiful roller bearing . " His manner remained highly formal as he ushered her out of the restaurant amid converging eyes from the bigfacedmen at the chattering tables and handed her into a cab . " We have neglected the feminine touch in industrial advertising , " he went on to explain as the cab rolled through the streets . " You 'll find the Roller Bearing folder on your desk , " he added curtly as , chest bulging , lie stalked ahead of her through the lobby and down the corridor into his private office . In spite of the fact that employees were forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she let herself drop back at her desk was to get Hildegarde Willard on the phone . " Garde let 's have tea at that horrid little place . Five thirty . It 's a dare . " Hildegarde was already there , wearing a fur hat that was n't any too becoming and her mother 's voluminous mink coat , when Lulie ran into the little tearoom . " Why Garde , you look like the fat lady at the circus . "  | " Mink is unbecoming to anybody but particularly to me , " said Hildegarde calmly . " I did n't have time to find my own coat because I was busy all afternoon getting out Josie 's weddinginvitations and left the house in a rush to catch the train . " " You 're an angel to come all the way in town , but I had to talk to a sympathetic female friend . " " Lulie what on earth 's the matter ? " Garde 's voice sounded like her mother 's when she said that . Lulie remembered how cozy it used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl and Mrs. Willard came to call . " Give me some tea . I 'm dogtired . I 'm tired as an old yellow mongrel dog . " She reached for Hildegarde 's cup and took a swallow of tea . " Is it about Zeke ? " " The great Hugh Swanson took me out to lunch today and my dear , he proposed . " " Proposed what ? " Lulie let out a shriek . " He asked me for my hand in mar-riage ! " Hildegarde threw back her head and laughed and laughed and laughed . Lulie saw her through tears of vexation all out of shape like in a comic mirror but she could n't help laughing too . " But it 's not funny , " she wailed . " You do n't need to sit there laughing like a hyena . . . He has n't even got his divorce yet . " " He must be horribly rich . " " I would n't care if he were J. P. Morgan himself . . . But you do n't understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walk the streets looking for another job . Jobs are n't any too easy to get now that all the boys are home from the wars . And he wants me to go along when he moves the agency to New York . " " But Lulie , you 'd like that . " " Of course . I 'd love it . It would be a way of getting away from Fiftytwo Ten . That 's why it 's all so awful . "  | " Why did n't you tell him you were engaged to Joe ? " " I did but he did n't pay the slightest attention . . . I hate his little old job but it 's pretty well paid and if I went to New York I 'd be an executive . " " Lulie , " Hildegarde calmly changed the subject , " I 've been thinking I ought to try to get a job myself . I 'm tired of being fattened at home like a pet pig . At college I took shorthand and you know how good my typing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Garde . The only reason I 've gotten anywhere is I made such a miserable secretary they had to start me higher up . I 've hated it and it 's been fun too and now it 's all over . " " Fiddlesticks . All you need to do is look him straight in the eye and never let him mention the matter again . " " But he gives me the horrors . Imagine the great Hugh Swanson in his B.V.D.s . " They both got to giggling . Lulie said she could n't stand it out at Fiftytwo Ten that night if Hildegarde did n't come to supper . She could get Mrs. Willard to send Wesley in with the car for her afterwards . Lulie had developed a headache and declared she 'd die if she had to sit all that time on the trolleycarso they decided to split the price of a taxi . The next morning Lulie woke up with pains in her bones and her skin hot as flannel . Her head swam when she tried to get dressed so she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that he said right off it was the la grippe and that it was all over town . She said for Lulie to stay in bed but she did n't seem so much worried about her as about Aunt Lyde . The doctor had said they must he very careful to see Aunt Lyde was n't exposed because her heart might not stand it . Feeling like a leper in quarantine Lulie lay in bed that day and the next . She did n't get much attention because nobody but old Emma came near her , but she read a lot and it was a relief to have a real excuse for staying home from the office . Miss Ebbitt sent hyacinths in a pot and an envelope full ofp277copy to return by mail with suggestions . Friday night Ben came home . When she heard him in the hall Lulie called to him that she had the benignant la grippe but he came right on in . He said if he did catch it it would be an excuse for staying home from classes . Saturday he brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful time playing rummy and talking about how they were going to sneak up to the lake some winter and set fire to all the new cottages along the shore . When the American Beauty roses with five foot stems arrived by special messenger from Hugh Swanson Ben carried on so Lulie knew she would never hear the last of it . Ben could be a dreadful tease . " But Ben they are from the firm , " she insisted . " At the great Hugh Swanson 's all the employeesget American Beauty roses when they fall sick . " Lulie told Ben to take the roses into Aunt Lyde 's room and he came back reporting that Aunt Lyde was very much impressedand said that they made her feel like a Gibson girl . " This grippe makes me feel like one too , " said Lulie . That afternoon Ben went downtown to go to the fight with Georgie and Jasper . Lulie who was beginning to feel better lay cozily in bed in the new silk bedjacket with real valencienneson the sleeves that the Willards had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloaming of a lowhangingwinter sky , reading Arnold Bennett and stopping now and then to dream drowsily of being married to jasper Millironand living at a ranchhouse on the great dry flank of a mountain and riding the range all day through bare open country empty except for patches of cattle and brighteyed prairie dogs sitting up with their paws hanging at the edges of their holes . Of course he never had asked her , but there was a helpless look in his eyes when he looked at her like when they 'd danced that night and he 'd told her about General Grant 's mule . My how Aunt Lyde would carry on if she rushed out and married Jasper . " My dear he 's totally uneducated , " she 'd say , " and only a gentleman by act of congress . "  |p278Thinking  about marriage made her think about Joe . She knew she ought to have been thinking about Joe all along . First thing in the morning she 'd sit up and write Joe a letter . She could n't marry him but she loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must make him understand she never could marry him . Her eyes filled with tears when she thought how awful it was to cause pain to Decent Respectable . Maybe she just ought n't to marry ever . Maybe Ben would n't marry either and Zeke would get over thinking Mugsie was a sacred trust and when Aunt Lyde died they 'd all get an apartment downtown together , and she 'd keep house for them . She ran through a series of little pictures like magic lantern slides in her head of the three of them in oldfashioned rooms that smelt of American Beauty roses while it snowed outside getting old and gray and crotchety together but not really , just the way actors aged by putting on fresh makeup and white wigs between the acts of a play . She felt a sharp jab of remorse for thinking " when Aunt Lyde was dead . " Poor dear Aunt Lyde . She must n't even think it . She felt a little guilty flush on her face and opened up the book and tried to forget herself in her reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to Joe Newcomer . By afternoon she had that load off her mind and felt so chipper that when Georgie and Jasper came out to see her she got up and put on Aunt Lyde 's old wadded dressing gown and walked down to the den at the end of the hall to talk to them . The boys looked redeyed and quiet and drank a lot of icewater . They all said it was a wonderful fight , lightweights , real boxing , but they did n't seem to remember much about it . Afterwards they had gone to Steve 's and it had been quite a brawl , a wonderful brawl , polka , plenty polka but they did n't seem to remember much about Steve 's either . It was plain that there were things about the evening they were n't telling Lulie . Georgie would launch out on a story and then Ben would get an embarrassed look and start to fidget and Jasper would change the subject.  |p279It  was Jasper 's last day . They were putting him on the train for Minneapolis that night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This life 's too rich for my blood . " He gave Lulie what she 'd come to think of as his Missouri mule look . For a moment she wished she was out alone with Jasper . Then she could get him to say what he thought . But none of them were saying what they thought . There were pauses when they could n't find anything at all to say to each other . Jasper in a gray civilian suit a little baggy at the knees did n't look half the Jasper he had in his uniform with the captain 's bars . She liked him all the same but differently . On a ranch he 'd he the same old Jasper again , but he was giving that up . Everybody was giving everything up that was fun . The pauses grew longer . Lulie began to feel the lonesomeness of the suburban winter twilight seeping into the room . She began to wish the boys would run along and let her go hack to bed . When they finally got to their feet , Georgie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner and pushed two typewritten sheets at her . " Lulie , it 's my first byline , " he said . " See , by Elbert Warner . . . Read it . " He never took his eyes off her face while she read a terse little account of a beaten prizefighter sitting on a bench in the basement and pulling on his clothes to go home " My Georgie , it 's clear and cool , " said Lulie . " I wanted it cold , " he said hastily . " Bugs did n't exactly commit himself . Those bastards never do but lie gave me to understand that if I did him a few more human interest pieces like that he might try to get me a weekly column on the sports page . You know Ray Stannard 's going to the New York World . Bugs wants human interest . We 'll give him human interest till he cries uncle . " " George Elbert , " Lulie looked at him with her eyes big , " I always knew you were a comer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't . . . " He looked at her hard with that little jiggle of the pupils of his brown eyes that used to make her so nervous when they were both children . " Hell'sp280bells it 's no use , " he spat out the words . " Sometimes , " he whispered huskily , " I wish I was Ben . " " Ben , " Lulie ran over to her brother waving the typewritten sheets ; " what do you think of Georgie 's byline ? " " It 's all right , " said Ben . " The lad 's got a future behind him . " " And all the time I 'll be sweeping out that flourmill , " said Jasper . " You buy your ranch , Jasper , " Lulie said , " and we 'll all come out and ride the range . " Suddenly she could n't bear to see them go . Although she was feeling shaky in the legs again she ran downstairs with them to help them into their heavy overcoats . They all yelled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't until she was walking back through the livingroom to the dark oak stairway that she noticed that Uncle Purdy and Mrs. Ritchie had been in there all the time sitting in a corner at a cardtable playing double solitaire . When she shuffled back through in her woolly slippers they both looked up at her out of the corners of their eyes at the same moment . For the first time she noticed that they looked a little alike . Their faces wore the same pudgy dissatisfied expression . " Your dear Aunt Lyde was asleep , " said Mrs. Ritchie in her deep contralto . . . " Mr. Rumford and I were killing a little time . " " Double solitaire , " grumbled Uncle Purdy . " It 's more work than an inventory . " " Do you suppose it would be all right if I went in to see Aunt Lyde this evening ? . . . I do n't think I 'm noxious any more . " " Of course , " boomed Mrs. Ritchie . " She surely has missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got back under the covers of her bed in the gloaming . Right away she fell asleep . When she woke up it was dark . She was hungry . She ran down to the kitchen to fix herself an icebox snack from the Sunday chicken.  |p281She  carried a sandwich and a glass of milk up to Aunt Lyde 's room to eat it . All the lights in the room were on . Aunt Lyde was lying back on the pillows with a handkerchief across her forehead . " Oh Lulie you might have come sooner , " she mumbled in a little moaning singsong . " They all left me .. . that woman 's gone off and left me to die . My dear , Purdy has n't been near me all day and you 've been off with your companions . Some day , my dear , you 'll learn how dreadful it is to be left alone . " " Oh I hope not , Aunt Lyde , " said Lulie briskly trotting around the room patting her pillows and bringing fresh cologne for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die at the age of thirtythree precisely if I do n't decide to becomea hermit . " " Lulie I 've been wanting you to bring me my jewelcase . Oh dear what have I done with the little key ? " " I bet it 's in the drawer of the night table . " Lulie found the key and brought the small wooden chest off the bureau over to the bed . It was the chest Lulie used to love so when she was a little girl because it had tiny drawers that locked and two proud pheasants carved out of dark wood on the lid and because Uncle Purdy had bought it for Aunt Lyde at Chamonix in Switzerland on their wedding trip . She used to hear its music box tinkling out " Ach du lieber Augustin " when Aunt Lyde was dressing for dinner or when something very festive was going to happen . Now Aunt Lyde cradled the chest with one arm and tried to claw the little paper packets out of it with a shaking hand . She had the strangest furtive suspicious expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Lulie from seeing what she was doing that Lulie took a book and settled down with it in a chair in the corner . The little tinkling familiar tune started up and grew slow and died . " Darling , " Aunt Lyde started to whisper , " I ca n't remember where I put Grandmother Harrington 's sapphire brooch or thep282Addison cameos , and I used to have so much jet . . . What could have happened to it ? " Lulie put the book down and got to her feet . " Aunt Lyde dear , let me help you . " Aunt Lyde 's eyes were bleary with tears . " Lulie , I ca n't remember what I did with Mother 's things . You children should have them . I ca n't remember . It would be so awful if they had been stolen . That woman 's been trying on my gowns . " Aunt Lyde covered the little mound of tissuepaper packets with one hand and started stuffing things back into the drawers as fast as she could with the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face . " But how could she Aunt Lyde ? " Lulie could n't help laughingat the thought of dumpy Mrs. Ritchie wearing gaunt Aunt Lyde 's dresses . " She 's such a different shape . " Aunt Lyde was staring at her with the unsmiling miser look on her face . " I had meant to give you your grandmother 's garnets , " she mumbled , " but now of course it 's out of the question . Very little of this jewelry would be suitable for a girl employed in office work . " " Now Auntie suppose I read to you . . . You know it 's not good for you to work yourself up . " Aunt Lyde let herself slump back on the pillow with her trembling fingers over her mouth . Lulie managed to put the rest of the tissuepaper packets back into the drawers again but when she tried to take away the little chest Aunt Lyde snatched at it . Lune could n't get her to let go . She finally went to sleep with both hands clasped over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crib with a toy . By the time Lulie crept off to bed she was thoroughly worn out . She woke up next morning with her nose red and running and her sinuses stopped up and lay huddled under the covers wondering whether she ought to mail her letter to Joe Newcomerwhich she could see across the room propped against thep283mirror on her dressing table . She was wondering too what on earth she 'd do about the great Hugh Swanson when she had to go back to the office . She 'd about decided the best way out was to become a recluse and pass poems through the crack of the door like Emily Dickinson when she began to feel hungry . A recluse had to have room service . At last she could n't stand waiting any longer and ran to the head of the stairs and called down to ask Emma why she had n't brought her up any breakfast . " I thought you 'd gone to work Miss Lulie , " Emma answered . It seemed hours before Emma came groaning up the stairs with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Emma shaking her head . " Oh Lord , I guess I 'd better get up , " said Lulie . " You better had , Miss Lulie . " Lulie had barely time to swallow her breakfast when Mrs. Ritchie came in , wearing her white uniform , trying to put on the crisp professional manner of a real trained nurse . Aunt Lyde was running a fever and seemed quite incoherent , poor soul . She said Lulie might as well stay in bed . Mrs. Ritchie had already called Dr. Warner and he was on his way . " Be sure to let me know when he conies , " said Lulie . " Of course , " said Mrs. Ritchie and went bustling out . In the middle of the afternoon Dr. Warner came into Lulie 's room suddenly , bringing his smell of stale pipes and iodoform and unwashed linen . He bent his unsteady black glance severelyon her face , stood threateningly over the bed and , in a half boisterous half peevish tone that made her feel it was all her fault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about time we admitted to ourselvesthat your poor Aunt Lyde has reached the end of her tether . It 's a miracle she 's lived this long , " he added angrily : " I 'm getting Doctor Hawkins out for a consultation just so we 'll none of us have anything to reproach ourselves with . I 'll get him to talk to Purdy but I 'm sure Purdy has resigned himself to the inevitable by this time . You 're damn lucky to have that Mrs. Ritchie in the house . There 's no way of getting ap284nurse or a bed in a hospital either with the flu epidemic on . I have n't slept in a bed for three nights and I do n't expect to for three nights more . I do n't know what keeps me going except that we Warners are tough . . . What do you think of that boy of mine ? Is he going to turn out to be a successful newspaper man or just another drunken bum with literary cravings ? You look all right anyway , " he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be the one to make out your death certificate . . . You 're far too pretty . " He gave that dry laugh Lulie hated . " I 've made out plenty of ' em this week . . . . Keep out of drafts , wrap up warmly , plenty of orange juice and plain nourishing food , " he finished in a routinesingsong that made Lulie think he must have repeated the words at a hundred bedsides all over Woodlawn . . . " Do n't get overtired and take a tablespoonful of cod liver oil daily . " Lulie made a face . " Do n't like it ? Well , the Esquimaux think it 's delicious . " He gave another hacking laugh and was gone . It was partly the fear of another visit from Dr. Warner that got Lulie out of bed and down to the office next morning . Aunt Lyde had gone off into a heavy sleep and seemed neither better nor worse . Although Lulie felt pale and weak it was a relief to be back in the routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Ebbitt , and the chats with the telephone girl and the office boy 's friendly enquiriesand the great Hugh Swanson 's most thoughtful-of-his employees voice over the phone asking her if she was sure she felt well enough to come to work . She was just picking her notes up to go out to lunch with Miss Ebbitt to talk about the Bonmeyer account when there came Mrs. Ritchie 's deep voice hardly audible on the phone . Aunt Lyde was sinking fast . Doctor Hawkins and Doctor Warner were in consultation . Better come right home . All the way Lulie kept urging the taxidriver to hurry though she knew in her heart there was no sense to it . Thep285real Aunt Lyde had been gone for years . When the taxi stopped in the driveway of Fiftytwo Ten Lulie jumped out without paying and ran breathless up the stairs . From the halfopen door of Aunt Lyde 's room came the familiarscent of colognesoaked handkerchiefs and of drawers saturated with dry lavender . Mrs. Ritchie 's stubby form stood in her way with a pudgy hand on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear it 's too late . Her lungs filled up and her heart stopped . You must n't come in until the mortician has fixed her up . Why do n't you go around and draw all the shades so that the neighbors will know there is a death in the house ? " Not knowing what else to do Lulie did as she was told . The taximan was still waiting in the front hall . She found Uncle Purdy was sitting at the diningroom table with his head in his hands and no expression at all on his face . As she did n't have enough change in her purse she had to ask him for money . At the dinnertable Lulie found herself arguing bitterly with Uncle Purdy about the funeral arrangements . She did so want to take Aunt Lyde up to the lake to bury her beside the little shingled church she used to love to look at cuddled among the pines from her chair on the front porch of the cottage . Uncle Purdy said the lake was impractical . It was winter . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight . He believed in cremation . " But Aunt Lyde was a good Episcopalian . She would n't like to he cremated , " Lulie wailed . " There there my dear , you must n't get all upset , " mumbled Mrs. Ritchie looking at her with surprised round eyes . Intermentat the lake would be far too expensive , Uncle Purdy insisted . Better put the money in on a suitable monument . " She believed in the resurrection of the body . " Lulie jumped up from her chair with the tears spouting out of her eyes . Uncle Purdy got to his feet and faced her , for a moment too angry to speak . " She was my esteemed and beloved wife , " hep286said at last . He was panting . The veins were swelling on his thick neck . As if she were watching a scene in a play Lulie saw herself and Uncle Purdy facing each other across the table with snarling faces . " And the life everlasting , " she wailed and ran sobbingupstairs to her room the way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantrums . She locked the door and threw herself all dressed on the bed . Mrs. Ritchie was in her element at the funeral in a black silk dress with black sequins on her bosom . She was solemn and kind with everyone , she rolled up her eyes with admiration over the stiffly wired flowers . She knew the names of the undertaker'smen and was cozy with the minister . She arranged the seating in the carriages and picked out the hymns to be played on the organ at the chapel at the crematorium . Lulie did n't feel like herself at all in the horrid little round black hat that did n't go with the shape of her face . Ben and Zeke bore no resemblance to themselves either and even the dear Willards had the look of being dressed up for a masquerade . When at last it was over she climbed into the Willards ' car beside Hildegardewithout waiting to be invited . " Well at least Mugsie did n't conic , " she broke out as the big car turned out from the cemetery gates into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to a movie all by herself with a box of weekend chocolates . She said she did n't believe in making a fetish of death . " She could n't help giving a little chortle . Mrs. Willard 's face took on its natural cozy smiling look . " Child , " she said , " why do n't you spend a few days with us ? Edward will drive you in every morning . You know how early he goes in . . . Your job at Fiftytwo Ten is finished . " " I hoped you 'd say that , " said Lulie . As she drove out through sunny snowpacked suburbs the word finished spoken in Mrs. Willard 's sweet reasonable tones sank down and down into her mind . Finished . Grandmother Waring and Aunt Lyde and Father and the life they 'd all lovedp287so at the lake , and going out with Joe Newcomer and her business career at the great Hugh Swanson 's . It could n't all be finished . How could everything be finishing before it began ? Finished , the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that she could n't pay attention to what Hildegardeor any of them were saying . When they got out at the Willard 's big comfortable wellheated hideous Tudorstyle house they put her to bed in a big comfortable wellheated room , and she went immediately to sleep . That spring she spent a great deal of time with the Willards but weekends she tried to be home at Fiftytwo Ten to make it seem less bleak for Ben . Mrs. Ritchie had stayed on from week to week after the funeral to keep house for Uncle Purdy and Lulie began to suspect that it would n't be long before she would turn out to be the new Mrs. Rumford . Lurie did n't mind a bit but with Aunt Lyde gone she felt herself so strange in the house . The life at Fiftytwo Ten that had seemed so dreadfully permanent now began to seem almost too temporary . It was n't Mrs. Ritchie 's fault . She really did try to make the Harringtons feel she wanted to be a mother to them all . Any excuse to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they were particularly high the sunny Saturdaywhen she waited for Georgie at the information bureau in the station to go out to Lake Leman for the weekend . Of course Georgie had to arrive late just in time to catch the train at a dead run . All the seats were taken . Georgie was crabby about going out to the Willards . " What the devil would they do out at Lake Leman all day Sunday ? Suppose it rained ? Would they sit in the Country Club and play bridge ? " He did n't know how to play bridge and he hated country clubs . And a picnic ? What the hell was this Willard idea of a picnic ? He 'd look about as silly at a picnic as Joe Jeffries at an afternoontea . Lulie was severe with him . " Now Georgie , " she said ,  | " you must pretend to enjoy it even if you do n't because it 's sweet of Mrs. Willard to ask all the Tribe out for a last fling before Josie gets married . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is Joe com-ing ? " Lulie nodded . " Why do n't you marry him and get it over with ? " " George Elbert if you go on making disagreeable remarks I 'm not going to speak to you . " " Then I 'll take the first train back to town and go to Steve 's and have a good time . What kind of a story am I going to get at Lake Leman ? Sports is my department not the society page . " " Got anything new for me to read George Elbert ? " " You do n't want to read about a baseball player that broke his finger . " " How do you know I do n't ? " Watching her face out of tense brown eyes with that little disconcerting jiggle in the pupils he handed her two typewrittensheets folded in the middle . " If there 's one extra word I want to know it . " Ile ground the words on his teeth . " A man 's got to learn not to write all over the page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train . Lulie glanced at the first few lines holding it up against the overcoatedback of the man in front of her . Already the train was beginning to slow down for the Lake Leman station . " I 'll have to finish it when I get to the house , " said Lulie . George gave her his black suspicious look and snatched the pages back . " I 'll let you have it later if I can ever get you away from Joe Newcomer . He 's the guy tried to drown me . I do n't forget that . " He was talking through his teeth again . " George Elbert act your age . " It was a pleasure to jump into the arms of Josephine and Hortense and Hildegarde , all so tall and slender and orna/mental in their big garden hats in the warm spring sun . Hortensewore a violet smock which she explained by saying she had been painting a still life . She must have put a little henna in the water last time she washed rer hair because it looked unusuallyauburn under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' house that Saturday in the diningroom that smelt of hyacinths and shone with silver and fresh laundered linen . The french-windows were open . Everybody was out in the sun on the terrace drinking sherry in front of Hortense 's newest painting that was very French and impressionist , of oranges and bananas nestling in purple shadow . Right away Joe Newcomer came up wearing a sad proud look and squeezed Lulie 's two hands . He led her to a corner of the hall and before she 'd had a chance to take off her hat or powder her nose told her straight out that if she really wanted him to be a brother instead of something else by gum he 'd be the best brother she 'd ever had that was that . " Now give me back the ring , " he added . " What ring ? " He looked pained . " Our engagement ring of course . " " Oh of course Joe I 'll get it after lunch . " Lulie ran upstairs to Hildegarde 's room to tidy her hair with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind . What could she have done with Joe 's ring ? Talking to Hildegarde she forgotabout it again . When the two of them looked down out of the window on their friends on the terrace below Lulie whispered to Garde that it was one of those days when everybodylooked their best . Georgie was a handsome fellow with his broad shoulders and his mustache in spite of his unpressed suit . Josephine and Dabney Brooks would make a beautiful bride and groom . He was too stocky for her taste , Lulie told Garde , but his face had a pleasant homemade look . Even HardingEdwards would pass in a crowd at the Art Institute . There was only poor Zke 's Mugsie looking hopelessly puttyfaced andp290bandylegged , out of place as a mongrel pup among a lot of thoroughbreds . After lunch Josephine and Dabney Brooks took all corners at doubles on the Willards ' tennis court . There was some talk of golf but Mr. Willard called up the Country Club and found that the greens were too wet . Georgie would n't play tennis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept growling that what he needed was a good tough bowling alley . It turned out there was a bowling alley down near the depot so when it began to get ( hilly on the courts they piled into a couple of cars and went bowling . Bowling turned out to be something Mugsie understood . Georgie and Mugsie made up a team that beat everybody . They all praised Mugsie 's bowling to the skies but all she would say was that she knew it was n't ladylike and it had n't been her fault if her daddy loved bowling more than anything . Zeke began to hover over her protectingly and finally came over and whispered in Lulie 's ear that he 'd have to take Mugsie back to Chicago . He had a lot of work to do anyway . He could see right now Mugsie was getting into one of her states . " You explain to the Willards , Lou . We 'll just slip away , " he said . " They 'll he heartbroken , " said Lulie . " You know they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a fanatical blue stare . " Not enough to forget their prejudices , " Ire said . " You mean it 's love me love my dog . " The words were out before Lulie could stop them . Zeke 's pale face stiffened . Ile turned his back , gathered up Mugsie with a long arm and hurried her out into the street . Hildegarde was roaming around in her bashful way trying to tell people it was time they started home for supper because Dad got all out of sorts il meals were even a second late . Lulie , who 'd been noticing out of the corner of an eye that Joe Newcomeron one side and Georgie on the other were waiting with that calf look on their faces to talk to her , darted off afterp291Hildegarde . " Let 's start a movement , " she shouted . " Everybody will follow . People always follow . " While she and Hildegarde were dressing for the evening , crowding each other a little in front of the tall glass on the bathroom door , she confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful . I just ca n't remember what happened to it , " she moaned . " I used to wear it all the time and then suddenly I did n't . " She started to sniffle a little . Garde laughed . " If things like that do n't work , they do n't work , " she said . " It 's better to find out before than after .. . But Lulie , " she dropped suddenly down on the square stool in front of her dressing table and the tears started spurting out of her eyes . " I ca n't get over Zeke . . . I find myself wishing such awful hateful things about that girl . I ca n't even say her name . " " I do n't think I could stand him if he was n't my brother . " " But he 's so talented , " sighed Garde . Already Mrs. Willard was knocking . " Dinner in five minutes , girls , " she called through the door in musical tones . After dinner they took up the rugs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and danced to the Willards ' new Concert Grand victrola . Everybody was too busy dancing to talk about their private lives and Lulie forgot everything dancing . It felt like old times when she caught a glimpse of Georgic and Ben sneaking off by themselves . probably to see if they could drum up a glass of beer in that bowling alley . When they were tired of dancing the young people crowded into the kitchen to help Hildegarde make penuche . It was late before they got to bed . The next morning the first thing Lulie heard when she woke up was a phoebe singing . The room was full of pink sunlight . She got up and dressed quietly so as not to wake Garde who was still asleep in the other bed and ran out of doors . The green grass on the lawn was beaded with dew . Bursting buds shone in the shrubberies . Back in the hedge she could hearp292songsparrows . Even the gang of English sparrows who had taken over the birdbath on the terrace looked quite distinguishedin their new brightly marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran into Georgie and Ben in their shirtsleeves . They had their heads together over the parts of Georgie 's big express rifle which they had spread out on a newspaper on an iron table . " Be careful of that cap pistol boys , " said Lulie , " and do n't shoot any of the Willards ' songbirds . " " I thought we could try some target practice when we went on this damn picnic , " said Georgie . " Give us something to do , " said Ben . " Too bad that damn little tart carried off Zeke . " " Georgie , " Lulie snapped at him . " If Zeke practiced , " Georgie went on blandly , " he 'd be an excellent shot . " " He always said all be got out of the war was his German Luger , " said Ben . " And a complete set of plans for the cathedral at Chartres , " added Lulie . " Lulie I would n't say that about Juliet Sims except among ourselves , " explained Georgie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to act so ladylike , " said Ben . " They all do , " said Georgie . " It 's a sure sign . " Hortense bore down on them from the terrace in her violet smock shaking her auburn curls in the sunlight . " Kids is n't it a day ? A day made to order . It 's the first time I 've managed to paint en pleine aire . . . I know it 's only a still life but before I never could see the color for the light . It 's not going to be a picnic it 's going to be a dejeuner sur 1'herbe and I 'm going to sketch it like Manet . " " And who 's going to furnish the nude ? " asked Georgie givingher his brash look . Hortense stared him down . " Maybe you and Ben could oblige . "  |p293Ben  and Georgie both blushed and the girls burst out laughing . " Those nudes must have been a hardy race lying out in the grass like that . I went out to Barbizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ froze to death there . In France , I wore woolly underwear from one year 's end to the other . " " Red flannel I suppose , " Lulie piped up , " but there 's no reason why nudes should always be girls . " The picnic turned out to be fun in spite of the sharp wind that came up as soon as they got to the place Hortense had picked out on a narrow dirt road where the Little Snake River took a bend on the edge of the prairie . Some old willowtrees just showing flecks of green gave a little lee against the wind to a patch of grass just on the edge of the crumbly bank . There they spread out the old buffalo robes , smelling of mothballs , Hortensehad found in her mother 's attic . While the girls unpackedthe picnic basket the boys roamed off towards a shack with a crazy stovepipe belching woodsmoke they 'd caught sight of round the bend . Hortense kept making the girls move the picnic spot till she got the carcass of an old Model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . Then she arranged the fried chicken and the ham sandwiches on yellow plates on a white tablecloth and the bottles of wine and the glasses the way she wanted them in the picture . The boys came hack crowded into a skiff they 'd borrowed from an old man without any teeth they said lived in the shack . At that moment the sun came out from between streaky clouds and shot a swath of blue reflected sky over the brown water . " Now it 's lovely , " said Hortense . " I may be able to get in the skiff . . . Now you all settle down and eat and please do n't move around too much . " She sat on some old knotted willow roots with her pad of Wattman paper on her knees . " Why does the river smell so dreadfully ? " asked Josephine munching on a chickenleg.  | " It 's that chemical plant at Smallwood , " said Dabney in a soothing tone . " It takes my appetite away . " " The old man says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I bet what those French painters did , " Hortense was sayingwithout looking up from her work , " was to undress one of the picnickers when they got back to the studio . " Dabney let out a whistle and everybody got to giggling . " Please do n't move so much . . . I have to hurry because the sky 's changing so . " " It 's changing indeed , " shouted Lulie . " The prudish old continental climate . " By the time they had finished eating and poured out the last of the claret the clouds had sealed out the last trace of blue in the sky . The sharp wind off the prairie , growing colder every minute , was beginning to whistle through the willowbranches . Ben said he reckoned he 'd better take the old man back his skiff before the river froze over , so they never got to the promenade sur l'eau Hortense had talked about for a second sketch . While the girls were packing the picnic things into the hamper , the boys took turns shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while Hortense said her hands were too cold to hold a pencil . When snow began to fly they packed themselves back into the two cars in a hurry and started for home . By the time they turned into the Willards ' drivewaythe cars were skidding and slewing in soft snow . Joe Newcomer said he was sorry but he had to leave right away in order to get home before it turned into a blizzard . " But it 's a three hours ' drive . Do n't you think you 'd better stay over ? " Lulie said looking up in his face . " I 've got to be in the office at eight . " Lulie followed him out to the car after he had said goodbye to the Willards . " Joe do be careful . " She talked over the noise of the engine.  | " I 'm too damn careful , " said Joe bitterly . Lulie loved him at that moment . " Joe I do n't know where that ring is , I must have lost it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the edge of tears . " You know I have n't got any memory , no more than a gopher . " Joe looked at her and she looked at Joe and suddenly they both began to laugh . " Do n't worry about the stupid old ring , sister Lucy . " " Now Brother Joseph you drive carefully . " He was gone in a swirl of dry snow down the driveway . She went back into the house to pack her bag . All through supper old Mr. Willard had himself a time teasing the young people about their picnic in a blizzard at Barbizon-sur-Snake . Right after supper Lulie and Ben and Georgie went off to the stationthrough the slush with Harding Edwards tagging along behind them complaining of the filthy middlewestern climate at every step . It was Harding who took her home to Fiftytwo Ten . He was going to get Zeke to sleep him on his couch . He wanted Zeke to help him hang a show at the Art Institute first thing in the morning . He said he knew Zeke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Too bad Zeke had n't been on the picnic , he kept saying . It had spoiled the day for him ; though he loved the lovely Willards , things were never the same without Zeke . That awful Mugsie kept him cut off from all social contact . " Might be a good thing , " mumbled Lulie sleepily as they trudged home from the trolleystop because neither of them had enough change for a taxi . " You mean it keeps him at work ? " " She does n't mean any good . My dear she 's even jealous of his architecture . " He ducked into the gale of wet snow blowinground the house to head for the garage . Once inside the front door Lulie pulled off her sopping shoes and ran upstairs to bed . With gloomy forebodings she remembered that tomorrow was Monday and she was supposed to gop296out to lunch with Hugh Swanson . Sufficient unto the day , she told herself out loud , is the evil thereof , and she fell asleep . She woke up late . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late for the office . Had she better be sick again ? But she 'd been sick so much and she had to see the great Hugh Swanson because if she looked him straight in the eye and said she was never going to get married and it worked she might keep her job . My , it would be wonderful to move to New York with the agency . As she hurriedly dressed she began to plan getting Ben a job there and moving Zeke . Of course all the great national firms of architects had their offices in New York . Then she could n't do without Hildegarde . She 'd have to find Garde a job too , but with Josie married that would leave Hortense all alone with her parents . If she got Hortense to go to New York to study art that would leave sweet Mrs. Willard without any family . Moving Mr. Willard out of his seat on the grain exchange would be a proposition . Somebody was knocking on her bedroom door . It was HardingEdwards . The big glass eyes stared out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips together when he spoke . " Lulie . Come here . Somebody 's shot , " he managed to whisper . " Not Zeke ? " He shook his head . Lulie was already running up the stairs to the apartment over the garage . The door was open . The big electric light bulb over the drafting table scattered with breakfast coffee cups jarred with the garish sunlight that poured in through the window . Zeke , a look of patient dismay on his face , stood in the middle of the room and worked a clip of cartridges out of his Luger . Behind him on the couch , her face the color of stale dough , sat Olga Lipschitz . She was trembling so the springs of the couch rattled . Between them Mugsie lay on the floor limp as a dropped doll . Lulie ran to her and began to feel her all over . " It 's not Mugsie , " said Zeke in a strained patient tone . " She was brandishing this thing around and acting silly and it went off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting up the screens and he fell off . "  |p297Lulie  had been becoming conscious of a singsong groan comingendlessly from somewhere outside . " He may be hurt , " she said and ran down stairs again . She found the Elder Broadwater lying on his back beside the ladder in the snowy shrubbery with the broken screen clutched in his arms . His gray eyeballs rolled . The shoulder of his long black overcoat was soaked with blood . " Zeke , Harding , " Lulie called from the foot of the stairs , " give me a hand . " From the apartment upstairs came shrieks and sobs from Mugsie mingled with Zeke 's drawling voice trying to calm her . At last Harding came down walking as if on peas . " Oh my nerves , " he said giggling . " I may faint Lulie . I always faint when I see blood . " " You go phone for an ambulance , " Lulie said and ran to get a sheet off one of the beds upstairs . She was trying to work the sheet gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Purdy all dressed for the city with his briefcase under his arm standing behind her . " What happened ? " " He 's hurt badly . . . He was putting in the screens . . . Mugsie was waving Zeke 's gun around and it went off ... " " They ca n't stay in the garage . Not after this , " said Uncle Purdy looking down at the elder in a dazed sort of way . " I wonder if Doc Warner 's still at his home . Go call him Lulie . " " I sent Harding to call an ambulance . " " Not the police , " shouted Uncle Purdy . " I want Doc Warner here first . " Suddenly he kneeled down beside the elder . " Let 's see how bad he 's hurt . " " Lord Mr. Rumford , I 'm glad it 's you and Miss Lulie . What she want to shoot me for ? I ai n't never done her no harm . Tell me I ai n't hurt bad . " Emma was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smirked at Lulie . " I thought I 'd be more usefulif I had a cup of coffee . I could n't think of any hospital so I called the police . "  | " Emma , " Lulie said without looking at Harding , " go out and help Mr. Rumford . The elder fell off his ladder and he 's hurt but I do n't think it 's too bad . " " I was scared to look Miss Lulie , " said Emma . " I heard an awful bang go off . Praise de Lawd , he ai n't hurt bad . " Lulie ran to the phone . It took hours to get the Warners . Mrs. Warner started to tell her all about a bridge tournament she was organizing and asking did she think Georgie was going to do well in newspaper work . " But there 's been an accident here . We need the doctor , " Lulie kept insisting . At last Doc Warner 's voice got on the wire grumbling that nobody ever let him eat his breakfast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt , gunshot wound in the shoulder . " Em afraid he 'll bleed to death . " Lulie got back in time to help Uncle Purdy and Emma , using the sheet under his back and an automobile rug under his middle , drag the elder out of the snowy bushes into the garage . He screamed with pain as they laid him out on the concrete floor . Uncle Purdy started to try to cut the coat away from his shoulder with a pair of scissors . Lulie ran upstairs to Zeke 's apartment to get a pillow for his head . The police were there ahead of her , too heavy cops and a foxyfaced lieutenant . Mugsie stood in the center of the floor talking and talking . " I shot , " she was saying , " to save my home . " " Officer , do n't pay any attention to her , she 's hysterical , " Zeke interrupted , but it was obvious that the officers were payingattention to her . " That foreign woman , " Mugsie pointed at the place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just meant to wound her lightly in the arm so that she 'd keep away from my home . She and that faggot . They 've ruined my home . " " Where is she ? " asked the lieutenant . Olga had disappeared . The cops looked in the bathroom and the kitchenette and in the bedroom closet . One of them got on his knees to look under the studio couch . It all got top299be like an oldfashioned French farce . When they gave up looking for Olga Lipschitz Lulie found their brassy appraising eyes turned on her . " Who 's this woman ? " asked the lieutenant turning to Mugsie . Mugsie was the one he was paying attention to . Mugsie was holding the center of the stage . " She 's his sister . She 's been against me too , " she chanted in a triumphant tone . " But the elder . We ca n't let the elder bleed to death . Do n't any of you know first aid ? " Lulie heard herself insisting in her Aunt Lyde 's thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the lieutenant indifferently . " I 'll take him a pillow . " " No , " said the lieutenant . " Leave everything where it is . This may be murder . " " It 's the unwritten law , " intoned Mugsie . " I shot to defend my home . " Lulie brushed past the cops and snatched a cushion off the studio couch . " Keep her in sight , she may be a material witness , " she heard the lieutenant say . His voice trailed off helplesslyas she ran off downstairs with the cushion . Doc Warner was already there . He snatched the cushion out of her hands and tucked it under him where he knelt on the concrete beside the elder . He had managed to uncover the bloody shoulder . He was probing with a bright instrument of some kind . " I 'm no bonesetter , " he was muttering through clenched teeth . The eider 's poor woolly head was threshing from side to side on the bloody sheet . His skin was violet . He was screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse about the way his long yellow teeth showed each time he screamed . Emma crouched at his feet sobbing with her apron over her head while Uncle Purdy paced back and forth his round mace pale and beaded with sweat . " For God 's sake Bert give him some morphine , " he was saying.
