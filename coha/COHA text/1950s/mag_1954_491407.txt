Tiny victims of the Korean war arc among those ' oho lune benefited from the inure than 1:1,001 ) , ( 100 packages sent out by CARE . Families have frequently named babies for the giver of a CARE parcel . A N an editorial on CARE  --  Cooperative for American Remittances to Everywhere , Inc. ? the British magazine Punch said , " History has nothing to match the scale of such sustained generosity . " That is high praise indeed , and nobody disputes it . In the almost eight years since it sent out its first shipload  --  it was to France  --  CARE has distributed more than 13,000,000 relief packages to the earth 's needy in fifty-odd countries . Among those countries were the so-called Soviet satellites , where the sustained generosity was evident even after the Iron Curtain was lowered . CARE eventually was forced out of the satellites by the Red dictatorships , which demanded that the communist governments distribute the packages as the price of continued operations . Because this was an obvious attempt to nullify the good will CARE 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused . In one rase , at least  --  Rumania ? the CARE field man , Tucker P. E. Gougelman , was marked for lig wdation after peasant recipients of 1 he packages in Transylvania muttered out loud that ? ' Russia takes everything away ; America brings us food and help . " Gougelman , an ex-marine , was jailed three times after that . Ile defied the communist authorities so openly that Minister Rudolf Schoenfeld , alarmed for his safety , asked CARE 's executive director , Paul Comly French , to withdraw him . Only then did Gougelrnan retire from the field . Before he did , however , he stored CARE 's stockpile of packages on the grounds of the royal palace , which , up until then , had been respected by the communists . They continued to respect it long enough for other American relief agencies working in Bucharest to distribute the aid as needed . Later , as CARE 's representative in China , Gougelman had another skirmish with the communists . He got out of Canton just ahead of the onrushing hordes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea on a raft powered by a jeep engine . The raft flew the Nationalist , American or pirate llag , according to what territory Gougelman believed he was passing through . CARE 's field people have to be resourceful . The Russians claim , of course , that the organization is used for political purposes ; and , in each country , as the communist grip grew tighter , so did the restrictions on CARE . In each of the satellites the CARE representative was told frankly that one of his employees was a spy who would report everything to I he authorities , and each CARE representative was tailed wherever he went . Warren Pinegar , now director of overseas operations for CARE , says that when he was in Warsaw he became very friendly with his shadows , and usually would inform them of where be was going and how , so as not to inconvenience them unduly . When his staff gave him a party on the eve of his departure from Poland , the secret police standing around outside to watch over the proceedings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . What happened to the staff probably was not so gay . They had cornhatted the unforgivable sin of working for the Americans . The overwhelming majority of CARE 's packaged relief has been sent by Americans . but Canadians also were early donors , and now South Americans and Britons are too . Even people in European countries have joined in the personal giving as director French continues to expand the scope of CARE 'S activities . CARE at first confined its gifts to continental Europe  --  the original name was Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe , Inc. ? but it now embraces Asia and parts of South America . Some areas of Africa are included in future plans . Nor has the expansion been merely geographic . The total value of CARE 's giving to date is $165. - 000,000 , with director French broadening the aid from mere relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and self-help projects . The original CARE package was the so-called Army " ten-in-one " that contained bare relief rations ; now there are forty-nine types that include food , clothing , medicines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and iron lungs to hahy food and midwife kits . Not the least remarkable feature about all this is that it has been paid for almost entirely by ten-dollar donations  --  the standard CARE unit of cost  --  although the organization does have a general fund and accepts contributions to it too . These range from a few cents  --  people even have sent stamps and penny post cards  --  to many thousands of dollars . Director French also has added another kind of aid recently that actually is an investment . This is handled by a subsidiary called the Care Development Corporation in which donors are invited to buy stock . The funds thus derived will be used as working capital to help projects in hack-ward countries . It will pay dividends and will be a sort of private Point 4 . Since CARE guarantees delivery of its packages or your money back , its representatives have gone to spectacular lengths to make the guarantee good . They have delivered gifts by reindeer and sleigh above the Arctic Circle in Lapland ; by camel caravan across the Pakistan desert ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild mountain passes of Northern Greece . They have trudged to the more remote crags of the Carpathians ; ridden in open motorboats to the farther isles of the Hebrides , and in rowboats to carry help to the sufferers in the Greek quakes of last August . When floods broke the dikes in Holland in February , 1953 , CARE 's packages were delivered by helicopters to the stricken areas before even the Dutch army could get there . Even the Government of the United States has called on CARE for help . Last winter the Foreign Operations Administration had the agency process , package and distribute surplus agric , cultural products in Europe as a gesture of American good will , while Gen. Lucius D. Clay , as Military Governor of the American zone in Germany , actually made use of CARE to restore production in the Ruhr . This was in the winter of 1947-1948. when famine struck the Ruhr and workers deserted their jobs by the thousands to forage for food for their hard-pressed families . CARE , using Government supplies , distributed 3,000,000 food packages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt the job desert ion . All of this was in addition to CARE 'S regular job of distributing private relief . CARE has many heroes , but it has been able to accomplish its remarkable ends largely because of its fifty-one-year-old , 210-pound , Philadelphia-horn executive director , Paul Cornly French .

" And he has been doing his level best to see that nothing of the sort will ever come to pass . French and CARE are familiars in most of the world 's capitals , and thrice welcome . In Bonn , Chancellor Adenauer asks French for packages containing carpenter tools and other equipment . With these things , he says , youngsters will he able to learn trades and thus avoid the pernicious idleness that helped Hitler to proselyte among their predecessors . CARE sends the tools . It also sends " Welcome " kits for the throngs of refugees pouring across the line from Eastern Germany . These contain soap , towels , razors , toothbrushes and other personal conveniences for the refugees to tide them over until they get settled . Adenauer also tells French that had it not been for CARE , he himself would not be alive today . The food packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Belgrade , Premier Marshal Tito asks the visitor for food and tools . CARE , in co-operation with the United States Government , went into Yugoslavia in 1950 and in a few months distributed 35 , - 0011,4 ) 00 pounds of food to alleviate famine conditions . Tito has been very grateful for this and the continuing aid that CARE has brought He publicizes and praises the organization and gives so much co-operation that CARE 's people sometimes are embarrassed . Yugoslav citizens fill their station wagons with flowers , give them little gifts and actually try to kiss their hands . Tito takes CARE very seriously indeed . He also enjoys drinking slivovitz , the fiery plum brandy of the Balkans , with Paul French and is amazed to hear that Americans actually eat plums . They never have in Yugoslavia , he says ; they just drink them . In Athens , King Paul and Queen Frederika tell Paul French of the needs of Greek children ; he also learns that the Greeks , always concerned about food , never have known the art of home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another package is devised .

Premier Nehru tells French Thal India needs tools and instruction in self-help at the village level .

The reactions to all this are sometimes startling . In Colombo , Ceylon 's capital , when Paul French personally delivered the gift of hooks , the event was front-page news . The story was displayed prominently even in India . This puzzled French , because it seemed completely out of proportion until a Ceylonese friend took him aside . The nonsense that Americans read only comic hooks , he told French , was so widespread that the fact that they did indeed read and understand such weighty scientific and literary tomes was news to the Ceylonese and Indians . In Tokyo , Emperor Hirohito told French he hoped there would he more hooks on Abraham Lincoln , whereupon the conversation became animated and was of long duration . Hirohito is a Lincoln expert ; so is French . SICItiti ) %1 Response to CARE 's 41 id is never impersonal . This , obviously , is due to the fact ha I.

The recipient knows , therefore , who has sent the parcel , so his response usually is personal arid direct . This has led to close trill-MIMS n ic friendships . One of the most unusual of these is that bet ween the wife of an American veteran and the German mother of the ex-soldier 's illegitimate child . The American woman sends CARE packages to the German woman and the child because , she says , " she gave my husband love and affection during a very difficult time of his life and she deserves all the help she can get . " From Glasgow conies a letter from a hard-pressed Scottish family to a CARE donor in Des Moines , Iowa , thanking him for the fine ham he had sent and telling him , " We saved it for months . Then we had twelve people in and ate it in celebration of the Coronation Day of our most gracious queen . " Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Paul French 's packaged diplomacy , " and recently there has been a developing tendency on the part of the recipients to reply in kind . - You give things to us , " people say to CARE 'S distributors . " What can we do in return ' ? " This has given the indefatigable French new ideas . He has directed CARE 's field people to encourage this desire as much as possible . The results have been an influx of Yugoslav needlework and dolls ; German woodcarvings and chess sets ; Japanese ivory art objects ; Philippine bamboo and wood ligures ? all received by CARE 's package senders . Recently , when Americans began sending children 's books ? mostly pictures , with an inserted translation in the local language ? to various countries , they received children 's books in return for distribution among American youngsters . " You get enough of that sort of thing going , " says Paul French , " and you 'll have no more wars . " EN EN I NG l'usT In Austria ' the prestige of CARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes them . They do this on order from Chancellor Leopold Fig ! , Paul French 's good friend and companion in attending the races at . Vienna . All over Europe there are infants known as " CARE babies " he-cause the mothers were nourished by CARE food packages , and the babies were delivered with the aid of CARE midwife kits and were fed supplemenhilly from CARE haby-food packages . Frequently the babies are named for the giver who sends these things . CARE packages have promoted marriages when the sender and receiver met personally after long correspondence , and the fact that a person is known to receive CARE packages has brought the recipient new local standing . An outstanding example of this is that of a German girl in Hamburg . When the housing shortage there was acute she advertised for a room and got nowhere until she mentioned in the ad that she received three CARE packages monthly  --  the maximum ? w hereupon she had literally hundreds of offers , some of them with marriage proposals thrown in . The hree-packages-a-mont It limit was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even so , t here have been rackets . A man in Berlin copied names and addresses of 8110 prominent Americans from a n edition of Whn 's Who he found in a Berlin library . He then sent letters to the 8110 , soliciting CARE packages for himself . He had received several ? this was before the three-a-month rule  --  and ninety-two orders actually were delivered in CARE 's Berlin offices before anybody got suspicious . Since a CARE package at t hat time ? it was just , after the war  --  would have fetched $1511 in the open market , the gentleman would have made a fortune had he got away with it . He wound up in jail . As for the black market , CARE 's people admit that it is possible some of their packages do get into it . There is , after all , no way of checking what a recipient does with his package and it may be that some of the gifts are sold . At one time CARE paid its distributors in Germany in packages in lieu of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into the black market . There also was the instance of a CARE distributor using CARE 's name to get duty-free delivery of American automobiles in France . All CARE deliveries are duty free by agreement between t he organization and the countries in which it operates . Since the distributor was , in fact , working for CARE , he was able to use the name . He sold the automobiles at . a very neat profit until CARE and the French Government found out what was going on . CARE often has been accused of supplying the black market when it had nothing at all to do with h the situation . This is because CARE has become a generic term in Europe where relief packages are concerned and almost anything in the category is known as a CARE package , whether it actually is or not . Even the relief-for-profit parcels that were prevalent for the first . few years after the war were known as CARE packages , much to the disgust of the organization . Generally speaking , the operation has been remarkably clean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I he years when the organization 's work was heaviest in t he occupied zones . The investigation lasted from 19.16 to 1949 . It revealed no irregularities of any importance . 12 THE SA'I'L FATAING POST February ill , PM Neil her has the organization been required In refund much money be-cause of failure to deliver packages . This is 1 rue even though the CARE de-livery guerantee seems In inspire pen-enegein .. on . One ple to high nights i fi man asked that a package lie sent to " die dirtiest man in Berlin . " It was so delivered , as well HS CARE research could determine . Another donor winded package delivered to the " thirteenth ' Dean ' in the London telephone directory . " This was done also , ; ill hough I he gent lenum caller ! for the package in It is limousine and with a liveried elm utfeur .

" Some man wanted a package sent to " a brunette with sensuous lips and coal-black eyes . She is a refugee in Macao , China . " CARE tries to oblige , although its distributors do n't think many of these requests very funny . Sometimes the deliveries require real ' , kid:ling . A great many are the results sentimental impulses on the part of the donors , who ca n't remember the names of the people they wish to help . Thus a New York couple sent a package to a Roman hackman 's license number . He had driven them around Rome when they had visited it on their honeymoon . A World War II veteran sent along a map and the instructions with his order : " Eighty-five kilometers northwest of Paris is this village . I do n't remember what it 's called , but you can find it if you follow the map . In the village square , right where it 's marked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the name of the baker , but he has seven daughters . I want the packages delivered to the eldest daughter . " Paul French says that is the shortest story he ever read , and one of the best . Another ex-soldier sent a map of the country around Sedan , directing that packages be delivered to the woman who had done his laundry  --  he could n't remember her name . It took CARE three days to find her , but they delivered . Then there was the celebrated matter of the radio program Heart 's Desire . Somebody on the program said that her heart 's desire was to send some oranges to a little girl in Poland who needed them to be cured of a rare disease . An orange grower in California heard the program , got the child 's name and address , packed the crates of oranges into a commercial airplane and sent ( hem off . In Paris , however , the orange man found that getting into Poland was a highly involved matter under the Red dictatorship . For weeks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finally thought of CARE . The organization was still operating in Poland under an agreement with the government . Could CARE , asked the orange man , deliver the crates ? CARE did deliver the oranges , even though the sick child lived smack on the eastern frontier , within sight of the Soviet Union , and therefore in a district where travelers ordinarily were not encouraged . The CARE man delivered the oranges , in fact , right into the child 's mouth . When he got to the village he discovered that nobody there ever had seen an orange , so he peeled one and fed it to the child by hand . Whether the child did indeed have a rare disease , nobody knows ; CARE had a job to do and did it . It was one of the last , things it did in Poland before the Reds drove it out . Paul French , however , admils failure in the case of Paulette Goddard and the donkey . Miss Goddard , louring Europe , had graciously volunteered to distribute some of CARE 's gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Movie stars , " a CARE official said not long ago , " sim* * * * * * * * * * ply love to give things away . Paulette was no exception . She gave away practically everything CARE had in stock in the places she visited , and some things we did n't . She said we could get what we did n't have and it would he all right . So we did and Miss G went on giving happily . As a sort of grand climnx to it all , she addressed a group of kids at a French orphanage just outside of Paris and said light heartedly that CARE would deliver to them the donkey one of the kids had asked for . I suppose you are aware that no donkeys are included in any of our forty-nine different . packages . " CARE thanked Miss Goddard graciously , if with h some relief , when the tour was over . " We just forgot about the donkey , " French cut in to explain . " And so , I suppose , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteeing delivery of a gift ? excluding donkeys  --  CARE . also guarantees that the donor will get more for his money by buying and distributing through CARE than he could anywhere else . ? ' If he ca n't , " says Paul French , - we 'll go out of litheness. : French thinks his greatest contribution to CARE has been the businesslike way in which he has organized it and the efficiency with which it operates . The big Quaker was as surprised as anybody else when he discovered that he had this talent . He 'd had no inkling that he was a good business-nom until he was called in to look over I he affairs of CARE  --  this was a year after the war had ended . Before that , he had spent fifteen years as a newspaperman in Philadelphia and as a United Press correspondent in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , and six years in Washington as the representative of the American Friends Service Committee on the National Service Board . The hoard was the agency that looked after the affairs of conscientious objectors during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable to themselves and the Government . Certainly in none of these activities had French any opportunity to display business ability . The Friends were one of the twenty-two religious , service and labor groups that organized CARE as a distribution agency . The original idea behind it ? t hat of person-to-person aid  --  was one that former President Herbert Hoover had been recommending ever since his vast experience in dispensing relief at the end of the first World War . It had proved popular . But its growth had been so rapid that its affairs were in chaos . CARE had been characterized by its first director , Donald Nelson , the former War Production Board chairman , as a " world mail-order house . " It is But Nelson 's tenure had been brief and under the succeeding director , the late Lt. Gen. William N. Haskell , the organization , through no fault of the general , had a difficult time . The orders poured in ; but CARE had multifarious difficulties in getting agreements with various nations , and in setting up distributing agencies in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had founded the agency as to how to proceed . Some wanted more general relief , others insisted on sticking to person-to-person aid . It was under these circumstances that somebody on the Friends committee suggested that French be asked to look into CARE 's affairs . Actually , because of the confusion and controversy and consequent discouragement , the founders had liquidation in mind , but they reckoned without their man . To a person with such an enthusiastic hatred for hunger and suffering , CARE was a weapon delivered into his hands by the Lord . French took over , and presently liquidation was forgotten . French shook CARE up from top to bottom . He installed a system of recording by business machines that saved on time and money . When CARE receives an order now it is recorded and processed so that everybody concerned is informed of it and the order confirmed for the sender . The ( Continued on Page Stl ) // ( I : opal hilleal Truitt Page 52 ) machines take care of 420 of these in an hour . French also recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. L. Gallo , a young department-More man , and put him in charge of buying . Goitio organized this activity into three areas : the food and textile ; the scientific and technical ; the hooks . Under books also come CARE 'S own otlice supplies . CARE 's buying is planned as thoroughly as is that of any chain store . Several times a year there are conferences to study economic signs and try to assay them . These meetings also take up the matter of various national needs and food preferences . Action is taken accordingly . Thus Britain , though by now well supplied with tea , is short on dried and canned fruits and butter , and her packages will be made up accordingly . Previously , tee was an import ant item in the British package . Also , there are weekly allocation meetings to review all the packages in all the countries . This is a sort of weekly inventory , which enables CARE to keep its stockpiles in various countries amply furnished and ready for emergencies . Thus , when the Russians clamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stockpile available in West . Berlin furnished all immediate needs until CARE made a deal with American Overseas Airlines and instituted its own airlift . The costs of a CARE package include the actual components , the New York overhead , the ocean freight , the insurance- there 's a $30,000,000 blanket policy underwritten by Lloyd's-the cost of local delivery to the recipient and what they call the profit . " It is not , of course , any such thing . CARE is a nonprofit organization and operates everywhere under the law as such . The profit actually is the cushion necessary to protect against loss on the package . This cushion may he anywhere from ten to thirty-five cents on the ten-dollar unit cost . On this basis , CARE has - made " about $6,000,000 in the last eight years , about $3,500 , - 1 ? 00 of which has been given as bonuses to the nations where the saving was made possible . This is done on a percentage basis and as general relief to he distributed by the government in question . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital for CARE 's new projects and for help when the organization " loses " money . Thus , during the last few years , as a result of the new self-help projects , which have been expensive to start , CARE had reserves from which it could meet the deficits . The self-help is harder to sell to the public than emergency relief . It includes undramatic things like education , health instruction , medical supplies-none of it simple charity . But Paul French believes this activity is the organization 's principal task in the years to come . Meanwhile , it takes money to start it , and here the reserve fund helps . It helps , too , when the buying for the holidays must be done . Nobody thinks of Christmas giving in July , but the buying has to he done then . The working capital is used for this , and the suppliers help , too , with deferred-payments agreements . CARE buys wherever the market is best . Thus at the moment it is using stockpiles of German coal in Austria , where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ton . It has bought Danish bacon when that was cheaper and more immediately available than the American product ; yarn in England for the knitt.ing package , beef and gravy in Ireland . Most of the material bought abroad is shipped in bond to the United States , where it is processed at CARE 's Philadelphia warehouse for reshipment . Ninety per cent of CARE 'S stocks , however , are bought in the United Staten . French also has made use of Government surpluses accumulated under the agricultural-supports system . CARE has bought some of these surpluses for concession &; prices . French has testified several times before congressional committees as to the advisability of using the tremendous accumulations of various farm products in this manner , and would like to have CARE made the distributing agency for these stocks . His plan is that CARE , as a private agency , would buy the surpluses at concessional prices and proceed , with other Government aid , to process them . " In the end , " he says , " the money used for storage now could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would reap would lie our profit . " The " profit " of the cushion , incidentally , also makes it possible for CARE to lose money on a much-needed package and make it up out of the others , assuming there are enough orders . Thus at the moment there is being distributed a so-called basic food package in Europe that costs the sender only five dollars , although its actual cost is almost eight . The difference comes out of the cushion funds . Another strong point in French 's business system is the preferred rate of exchange CARE manages to get in the countries in which it operates . But even here the organization 's people have used their imagination and audacity . In Poland , for example , CARE once actually did business in - pepper zlotys . This was when there was a shortage of pepper in the country and CARE was able to handle its distribution and shipping there more economically on a barter basis than by using money . Such accomplishments as these have earned the admiration of such an expert in relief as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Paul French , " You have good management , good luck and the Lord is with you . " But French says his job is only temporary . " Once there 's no need for CARE , " he says , " we 'll fold it up . But , " he continues , " I never did have II permanent . job . The National Service Board started out to he temporary , too , end lasted six years and certainly no newspaper job is very permanent . At least it was n't in my day . Maybe I should have gone into education , like my brother , Clement . " C. Clement French is president of Washington State College . Actually , Paul French is doing that which he loves best in this world-crusading against the evils of hunger and misery-and if he does n't do it as director of CARE , he 'll probably find some other way to accomplish his purpose . Not everyone will like the way he does it - Mr . French is not very patient where these things are concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there-hut that he will do it , no one will gainsay . French has been married twice . His first wife , the former Marie A. Kerr , a childhood friend , died in 1944 , after hearing him two sons . Peter and Paul . Peter is a student at Earlham College , a Quaker school in Indiana ; Paul , a clothing-company executive , is married and the father of two children . There are two children , Bruce , six , and Susan , five , by French 's second wife , Dorothy . The French family lives in a 163-year-old fieldstone farmhouse at Yardley , Pennsylvania , just up the Delaware River from Trenton , New Jersey , from which French , as if his prodigious world travel for CARE were not enough , commutes daily to the New York office when he is at home . This is about five months out of the year . The commutation amounts to about 130 miles a day in itself . The house is surrounded by gardens of its owner 's own cultivation , in which grow mimosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrubs and plants French has happened across while on CARE business at the ends of the earth . But . even in these pleasant surroundings the French hatred of hunger is not mitigated . The big day of the French week is Sunday . For one thing , that is the day the big Quaker goes to the meeting , but , for another , it is the day when he and Dorothy feed anywhere from ten to thirty people at Sunday dinner . This makes Paul French happy . It would make him happier if the table might be enlarged to include all the hungry people alive . THE EN ! )
