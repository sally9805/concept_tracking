The greatest artists Russia ever produced were the profoundly religious painters of icons of 15th Century Novgorod and Moscow . Their serene holy families and saints , compacted of austere line and pure color , were a legacy from Byzantium . But icon-painting went out of fashion when Peter the Great imported more sophisticated Western painting ( along with field artillery , shaving and ballroom dancing ) in the 18th Century . <P> Last week a small group of refugee Russian artists , impelled by deep religious feelings of their own , put on a display of 20th Century icons at New York 's Fordham University . Their modern icons dealt with the same devotional subjects-Christ Enthroned , The Archangel Michael , St. Nicholas , The Annunciation-as the 15th Century masterpieces . Painted in tempera on cypress or pine , they also had much of the same timeless , static charm . <P> The seven men and two women met as D.P.s in Hamburg at the end of World War II , organized a school of Russian arts &; crafts to fill their idle hours . Soon they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill commissions for Greek Orthodox churches in Britain , France and Belgium . <P> In the past year , eight of the nine came to the U.S. , took daytime jobs , spent their evenings painting . They hope that the Fordham exhibit will lead to commissions from U.S. churches , a chance to start another school and work full-time at their art . <P> About life in Soviet Russia , none of the artists , who range in age from 19 to 45 , has much to say . Several have relatives there . Says Anatoly Abramov , once a Soviet architect : " For different reasons and in different ways , we had come to a deeply religious time . We felt we could express our feelings best through the icon . "
