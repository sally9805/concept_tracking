txt The automobile parts industry , which was a bit shaky a year ago , is looking stronger . Many of Its 400-odd concerns report rising production of spark plugs . door handles , trim moldings and countless other items , as a result of Chrysler Corp . ' s ** boost in car output this year over 1956 and the 22 ' pickup at Ford Motor Co . Output of industry-leader General Motors Corp . has fallen 10.7 , ' , below a year ago ; G.M. , however , is a big producer of its own parts . But that 's just part of the reason for the parts industry 's revival . More compamea have been taking on non-automotive lines as a protection against the tendency of auto manutacturers to make more of their own components Diversification has given these parts makers a measure of year-round stability that they lacked when their business depended entirely on the seasonal ups and downs of the auto makers . Some Quit the Field True , some parts makers failed to adjust to the integration policies of the auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the auto parts business last year . And tiny Pressed Metals of America , Inc , Port Huron , Mich which operated in the red in 1956 , is slated to suspend operations this week for an indefinite period . Elsewhere , though , the picture is generally one of rising sales and higher employment . Toledo 's Electric Auto-Lae Co has Increased its work force in the past year by 2,000 to a total of 19,350 persons Sales of the company in 1957 show a " greater increase " from a year ago than the nearly 12 , e rise in the work force , according to M Wistert , vice president and director of industrial relations Profits also are ahead of lam for AutoLite , whose chief customer is Chrasler . More Customers for Aim. % orth Sales of Ainsworth Corp arc currently at the highest level in two years and 50 , , user year ago , reports J A vice president and treasurer of this Detroit auto parts maker . He credits the upturn to the rise at Ford and Chrysler and the fact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year W. G.

McCord also makes air conditioning coils for room coolers . Auto parts executives tend to be more cautious in outlook than their big brothers at General Motors Corp. , Ford and Chrysler . Parts makers know only 30 to 60 days ahead what their schedules are going to be . " Our schedules can change at a moment 's notice , depending on car sales , " says one parts company executive . Even so , the auto parts executives think they see a good year ahead . F. E. Fisher , vice president of sales for Eaton Manufacturing Co. of Cleveland says : " About a month ago . I was a little concerned sales might not measure up to earlier forecasts . But now sales are looking up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . " Some Optimistic Notes The head of one Detroit auto parts company says : " If the car makers approach the 6,500,000 output they 're talking about , the year will be a fully satisfactory one , " Last year 5,800.000 cars were built . Also optimistic is J. Thomas Smith , president of Detroit Harvester Co , who says sales for the January-February period " indicate " a new high for the company for the year . The company . which makes convertible top frame assemblies and other auto parts , had sales of $ ? 7,422,945 last year . Auto parts makers , of course , are watching closely any further integration moves of the auto manufacturers At present Chrysler makes " considerably less " of its total product than CI M or Ford , according to F. W. Misch , Chrysler 's vice president of finance He indicates that Chrysler is going ahead in integration , but " we have no policy of setting out to match ( G.M and Ford ) in this respect ? ' The auto makers seek integration mainly to cut Costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant now being built at Twinsburg , Ohio . is the latest example of the make-your-own-parts trend . The 1,500.000-square-foot factory is slated to begin production in the fall on rear-quarter panels . doors , deck lids , hoods and fenders for all the company 's cars . Budd Co currently produces many of Chrysler 's stampings . The auto makers are not rushing pelf mell to make all of their own parts . In fact , there are some instances of auto companies farming out new work to the suppliers Take the case of Michigan 's Mitchell-Bentley Corp . Its Ionia Manufacturing division was awarded the contract for making finished bodies for Oldsmobile station wagons when the G.M. division added the wagon to its 1957 line In addition , Ionia has been making Mercury and Buick wagon bodies According to Lion 11 Mitchell . president of Mitchell-Bentley , the Ionia division has 4,846 persons on the payroll , compared with a preroils high of 2 .500 last ala : ?

Outlook for Thompson C 11 Moore . staff vice president of sales for Thomason , says ' " Our automotive business so far this year , and for what we see through May , should he pretty much what it was last year , " and adds : " We would be very happy with that " Total Thompson sales , including 50,4 , in automotive with the balance in aircraft and other non-auto items , are currently running at a S3S0 million-a-year clip , compared with $306 million for all 1956 , says a spokesman Parts makers have been diversifying swiftly . Over the past 15 months . KelseyHayes Co , Detroit producer of automotive wheels and brakes . has made several acquisitions in the aircraft component field Perry Williams , president , estimates that aircraft products will account for 50 , , of sales in the current fiscal year , ending August 31 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisitions , he adds , will result in a " substantial increase " in sales for this fiscal year . Exit Wheel As a result of its diversification . KelseyHayes last year decided to remove the word Wheel from its corporate name , believing that the new name would be " more appropriate . " Mr. Smith of Detroit Harvester says his company 's policy of expansion through diversification " is paying off . " He adds : " We are no longer restricted to the manufacture of farm equipment and auto parts . " Other lines , which Include power mowers , spray booths , ovens and other industrial plant equipment , now account for 50% of sales . Ainsworth offers a dramatic example of the consequences of depending almost entirely on the auto makers for sales . For the first nine months of 1956 , when car output was off sharply from the preceding year , Ainsworth had a net loss of $309,000 . In the final quarter last year , however , when the 1957 models began rolling out , Ainsworth 'm net profit was $223,000 . Result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $85,814 for the year . " We 're making every effort to diversify our product , " says Mr. . " We want to stay in the auto parts field , but we 'd like to be less dependent on it . " Over 95% of Auraworth 's volume is automotive , with the remaining 5% in framing material . Midland Wants to Diversify Midland Steel Products Co. of Cleveland is another parts maker that wants to " broaden its base " through diversification , according to Vice President Campbell Elliott . Midlarld 's chief product is automotive frames , which accounts for 85% of total volume , Mr. Elliott says . The frames are used in Dodge cars and trucks , Plymouths , Ford trucks and Buick and Studebaker cars . Employment at the company 's Detroit , Owosso , Mich. , and Cleveland plants Is 5,000 at present , up 10% front a year ago . Mr. Elliott says January-February sales were " ahead " of the like 1958 period . A spokesman for Motor Wheel Corp. , Lana , ing , Mich. , reports automotive volume now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this auto work was 70% . Motor Wheel added a lawn mower line in late 1954 , and is a leading producer of oil and gas space heaters for the home , along with oil furnaces and water heaters . Auto sales for Motor Wheel so far this year are over 20% ahead of the 1956 period , the spokesman reports . The company makes car and truck wheels . Auto parts executives complain that fierce pressure is being put on them by the autc makers to keep costa down . " it 's a hellave battle , " notes one Detroit official . " You feel you 're entitled to pass on some of the higher costs of material and labor , but the car companies keep applying the needle to you . " Another auto parts official is unhappy about the " improvemement factor " that 's in the current labor contracts the automotive companies have with the A.F.L.-C.I.O . United Auto Workers Union . " My company , " he charges , " is not getting the additional productivity we 're paying for . " ? Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements , workers receive a yearly automatic wage boost of about  --  six cents an hour . W. D. , executive vice president and general manager of Monroe Auto Equipment Co. , Monroe , Mich. , reports sales to the replacement market are up 15% to 20% this year over the 1956 period . Shock absorbers and tractor seats are among the items Monroe sells to tills market . But Total Sales Are Off However , Monroe 's total sales this year " are quite a bit under " a year ago , says Mr. . This is because of the drop in purchases by Studebaker-Packard Corp . and American Motors Corp . Output of both auto makers is off sharply from a year ago . " Integration policies " in the auto industry are another factor in Monroe 's sales shrinkage according to Mr. . A growing field for the parts makers is the replacement parts and accessories business This business totals about $1.8 billion a year , says a spokesman for the Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association .

Murray Corp . of America in 1954 discontinued making auto bodies , it is making plumbing ware , appliances and pin-setting machines .
