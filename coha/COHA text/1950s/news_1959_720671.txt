txt We 'll start today where we ended yesterday 's editorial on inflation ? with the odd problem in semantics the word posed for the Cabinet Committee on Price Stability for Economic Growth in writing its report . The word " inflation " was n't used at all in the 1,600-word economic comment of the Committee and the reason given by one member was that the public really did n't kriCiw what inflation was . So wherever it meant , " inflation , " the Committee wrote " rises in the general price level . " Well , putting up prices is the way inflation works , all right . Inflation means a great many different things to different people ; to one man , it means a $10,000 house can be bought for about $1:5,000 . To the man down the street , it means no new car this year ; to his neighbor , it means no college for Junior when the time comes . In short , inflation means higher prices for everything from the cradle to the casket . But how inflation works and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been helpful if the Committee had said how inflation comes into being as well as how it manifests itself . And because we 're pretty sure a growing number of people are not only aware of how it acts but of what causes it , we think one example a member of the Committee used to claim how little people knew about inflation was rather imprecise . He said that some people thought that inflation meant deficit financing . He went on to explain that while budget deficits and inflation are related , they 're not synonymous . To be sure . But we think the people who correlate budget deficits with inflation are n't too wide of the mark . For they 're related , all right ; as closely related as father to child .
