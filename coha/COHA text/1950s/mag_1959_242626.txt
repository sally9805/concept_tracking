The most thunderous roar to come out of the West in recent years has been caused by Hollywood stars stampeding toward that newer , more refreshing substitute for the old water hole-the tax hole . As stars went into business for themselves or took percentages instead of salaries , Hollywood 's finances have become more spectacular and complex than its love life . <P> Of all the financial dipsy-doodling , none is more involved than a deal set up by a pair of film writers named Martin L. Rackin and John Lee Mahin . Ten months ago the team found a loose option on Harold Sinclair 's Civil War novel , The Horse Soldiers , snapped it up for a token $1 ( eventually they paid $30,000 for the book ) . Looking around for a director , Entrepreneur Rackin went to the best . " For the hell of it , I called John Ford . " Before long , Director Ford , a Civil War buff , agreed to do the picture for a $200,000 flat fee plus 10% of the gross after the movie has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star ? " One night we went over to Ford 's for dinner and found ' Duke ' John Wayne there , " recalls Rackin . The Duke joined up for $750,000 and 20% of the net , and later Bill Holden was only too willing to come in on the same ducal terms . Of the rest of the pie , 20% each went to the backers of the whole deal ( Mirisch Co. ) , to the distributor ( United Artists ) , and to Mahin-Rackin . Said Wheeler-Dealer Marty Rackin as Horse Soldiers was being readied for release : " Hollywood 's gone crazy . It 'll have to find its level again when all this dies down . " <P> Two other notable examples of Hollywood 's crazy finances : <P> According to Hollywood scuttlebutt , Gary Grant has turned the tables on Universal-International . Instead of taking a percentage from the studio for his current film , Operation Petticoat , Grant is said to have persuaded the studio to take a percentage from him ( 10% of the gross ) while he produces the picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Holden agreed to 10% of the gross , but for tax reasons wanted it paid to him at the rate of only $50,000 a year . The picture has already made so much money ( between $20 and $30 million ) that Holden 's share now stands at between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 . Not only will it take 40-year-old Holden at least 40 years to get the last of his money , but Columbia can in the meantime invest it and make well over $50,000 a year , thus in effect having got Holden 's services in Kwai for nothing .
