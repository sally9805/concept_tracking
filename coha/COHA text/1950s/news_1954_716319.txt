txt In the latest , and possibly the final , Communist proposal in respect to Korea , Peiping 's spokesman , Chou En-lai , comes back to the insistence that a free election in Korea should be supervised by a " neutral " body , in this case the Supervisory Commission made up of Sweden , Switzerland , Poland and Czechoslovakia . United Nations supervision is again rejected by the Communists as it has been from the beginning . This program for " neutral " supervision would be reinforced by the additional stipulation that election laws , candidacies , matters of eligibility and , of course , ballot counting and certification would be determined by a " joint " body of Communists and non-Communists that would be obliged to to in unanimity . This is what General Bedell ' Smith aptly called the " built-in veto . " We have had ample demonstration of its effectiveness in creating and perpetuating a deadlock both in Korea and elsewhere . Chou En-lai 's proposal is so manifestly dishonest , so outrageously fraudulent that it hardly deserves answer and comment except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well entrap the unwary . The term " neutral " sounds good . As we define it , a neutral is one who is not committed to one side or the other in a controversy . A " neutral " in the supervision of a Korean election would be one whose sole purpose was to see that each individual had a right freely to express his own wish . This is not the Communist definition of " neutral . " The fantastic picture of Poland and Czechoslovakia , entirely subservient to the Kremlin , acting as " neutrals " in the supervision of the armistice in Korea , sheds the correct light on what Communists mean by the term . What these " neutrals " have succeeded in doing is just what they were intended to do . They have prevented any observation of the countless and continuous violations of the armistice terms by the Communists . The Swedes and the Swiss have been made entirely helpless and their justified pro ' est has been blandly dismissed by he Communists as a propaganda rick . In other words the Communist neutrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armistice terms Would be violated with impunity by ? he Communists . They could be squally depended upon , naturally , to iee to it that there was no chance whatever for a free , honest election : n Korea . And the voice of the real Ieutrals could always be offset , just ' s it has been thus far , by the " builtIT veto . " " ' Much the same tactics are being used in the case of Indochina . Any settlement there , in the Communist proposals , would be under the supervision of a " neutral " body on which the Communists would again have the " built-in veto . " In other words no settlement could be reached except ) n Communist terms . The United States has been acused , both at home and abroad , of n " inflexibility " in its approach to Korean and Indochinese problems . hit there has oeen nothing in our repeated attempts to negotiate and our repeated making of concessions that is even remotely related to the " inflexibility " of the Communist maneuvers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we agree to " neutrals , " they must be Communist " neutrals " with a veto power . We negotiated an armistice in Korea on the assumption that the Communists wanted a " settlement " of the Korean problem . We are engaged in a discussion of a cease-fire in Indochina on the similar assumption that the Communists want a " settlement " of the issues involved . These assumptions have been , and are , false . It has become increasingly obvious that what the Communists want , and are determined to get , is not " settlement " but victory . We did not , let us fervently insist , go to Geneva for the purpose of making a surrender . We are not engaged in " negotiation " for the purpose of being beguiled and entrapped by spurious suggestions of " neutral " supervision . We are committed to the exploration of all avenues to peaceful " settlement . " We are willing to discuss rather than to shoot . This does not mean that we are committed to close our eyes to obvious facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be dumb in the face of preposterous falsehood and chicane . We are willing to discuss in good faith . We are still waiting for the first evidence of that good faith from the Communist camp .
