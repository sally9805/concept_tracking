In a lonely Kenya ranch house some 60 miles north of Nairobi , Mrs. Dorothy Raynes-Simson , a cattle rancher , sat chatting with her partner , Kitty Hesselburger . There was a noise at the door , a shout , and a gang of Mau Mau thugs , led by the ranch 's male cook , burst into the living room , brandishing panga knives . One man seized Mrs. Hesselburger by the throat , bent her across a chair ; the rest set upon Mrs. Raynes-Simson , who grabbed her revolver , a handbag necessity for most Kenya white women these days , and blazed away . She shot two men dead , one of them the cook . Then , taking careful aim , Mrs. Raynes-Simson killed the man who was struggling with Mrs. Hesselburger . The Mau Mau fled , with both women in hot pursuit . Dorothy Raynes-Simson found one of her attackers hiding in the bathroom and shot him , too . Then she called the cops and asked them to collect the corpses . <P> We Wanted Your Head . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmsteads were jumpy and alert . The Mau Mau , striking from their jungle hideouts , were now concentrating mostly on loyal Kikuyus , members of the sturdy tribe on which the Mau Mau prey for their recruits . Chief Ireigi Karamba was shot in both legs and one arm ; two African policemen and a Kikuyu schoolteacher were hacked to pieces . Three more tribesmen walked into the ward of a government hospital at Kiambu , sought out their chief , Hinga Hinga , who was recovering from a Mau Mau ambush , and shot him dead in his bed . A white farmer , returning home to find his house a shambles , unearthed a crude Mau Mau note : " God must love you . We wanted your head . " They got his headman 's : it rolled over the farmer 's boots when he flung open the door of the headman 's hut . <P> Queen 's Counsel . The Kenya government relies on British regulars , Kenya home guards and Wandorobe savages ( who get 10 per Mau Mau head ) to stamp out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mau Mau suspects ; several dozen have been killed and four hanged . Yet few white settlers believe the Mau Mau can be crushed until Jomo ( " Burning Spear " ) Kenyatta , the bearded Kikuyu whom the government accuses of masterminding the terrorists , is safely locked away . <P> Kenyatta , handcuffed and shabby after ten weeks in jail , was on trial last week in the remote northern outpost of Kapenguria . The principal charge was " management of an unlawful society , " but implicitly , Kenyatta was suspected of sowing the seeds of African Communism . His defending counsel was Britain 's slick Denis Nowell Pritt , Queen 's Counsel , the man who got Gerhart Eisler freed in England . Though he denies being a Communist Party member himself , Pritt can be relied upon to echo the familiar cries , including that of germ warfare in Korea . <P> Thanks largely to Pritt 's skilled defense tactics , Kenyatta 's trial is now a month old .                @ @ @ @ @
