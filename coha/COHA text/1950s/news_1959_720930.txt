txt Unimportant in " Remember themselves , milePearl stones serve the adHarbor " mirable purpose of providing the standards by which change can be measured . So it is with a milestone reached today , eighteen years after " Remember Pearl Habor " became a rallying cry that started us on the road to war , a road that , in the harrowing months that followed , often seemed to have no end . For the treacherous blows that rained overhead that sleepy Sunday morning jolted an insular United States into realizing that , whether we liked it or not , we had spread ourselves beyond the traditional boundaries of the Fourth of July orator , with his words about a land that stretched from the rocky coast of Maine to the sunswept shores of California . Today , only eighteen short years after the date in infamy , we find two new stars in our national flag , and the boundaries of our Union include for the first time the twenty islands of Hawaii , a state set as a jewel in the central Pacific almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country was spawned . There is something Scenes of inevitable about this Indelible change . When the Memories words " Pearl Harbor " were first heard on Dec. 7 , 1941 , they made up an unfamiliar name from an exotic and faraway land . Yet by the time peace finally had come almost four years later in Tokyo Bay aboard the battleship Missouri , many Americans had become as familiar with the geography of the areas washed by the waters of the Pacific as they had with those parts of Europe from which their ancestors had come . Okinawa , the Marshalls , Guadalcanal , Iwo Jima ? so many names that before the war had been unknown even to the most rabid stamp collectors  --  became as commonplace to headline-readers as Cape Cod or Coney Island . To too many families these places had become burial grounds of loved ones . To other families they served as datelines for letters from men tired of conflict and yearning for the comfort of the home fires . To all who served in the Pacific , they have become the scenes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an end and the thouto sands of Americans in the West Pacific areas returned to the pursuits of peace , the very old world had suddenly become a new world to us who remained alive . One American who ' particularly came to represent the areas of the South Pacific to the American mind was James A. Michener . Out of his wartime experiences with the Navy in the Solomons came " Tales of the South Pacific , " which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 , tales that soon after were adapted into the haunting " South Pacific , " one of Broadway 's most successful musicals of the postwar period . Other volumes came from Michener 's pen , too , all meant to interpret East to West . More recently , and as is hardly unexpected , he is coming to be associated in our minds with our fiftieth state , for he has moved eastward to Hawaii , where he has been involved in many ' of the activities that culminated in Hawaii 's entrance into the Union . Unlike the South Pacific , Hawaii is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor an area simply for him to describe as an understanding and observant journalist . For him Hawaii is home  --  and he has just written a work of affection for his new home in the form of a novel called " Hawaii . " But surely this is Only only the beginning . the For other writers are Beginning bound to be as fascinated by Hawaii as is Mr. Michener , who has written that in accepting Hawaii as our fiftieth state we are much like the man who finds himself married to a picture bride : " He does not really know her , but as he starts living with her he discovers that she is beautiful , intelligent and gifted with a dowry . " Others have discovered this before our day , as is apparent to anyone picking up a new anthology edited by A. Grove Day and Carl Stroven and titled , " A Hawaiian Reader . " Here are found the impressions of early voyageurs of the untouched paradise they had discovered , the accounts by the missionaries of their efforts to bring to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maugham , R. L. Stevenson , Jack London , Mark Twain , James Jones and J. P. Marquand . This is part of the heritage that we have happily taken as part of our own , and that we include when we say " Aloha " to Hawaii on this , the first Dec. 7 that the islands are one of us.
