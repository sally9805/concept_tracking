To swell the flow of oil to Europe , the Texas Railroad Commission last week finally ordered a big boost in allowable production . The decision added 210,901 bbl. to Texas daily output to a record 3,773,054 bbl . Behind the expected move ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) was Ernest O. Thompson , senior member of the state 's three-man commission , who insisted ever since the Suez Canal was closed that three small raises totaling 210,000 bbl. were the best contribution Texas could make . <P> General Thompson 's turnabout , which raised total U.S. production to a record 7,515,400 bbl. a day , did not mean that the oil shortage had worsened . Only a fortnight ago Thompson himself appeared before a House committee in Washington to argue with an expert 's persuasiveness that reports of a serious shortfall in the European oil lift were only a myth . Bearing out his analysis , Britain has since eased oil rationing . <P> Cutback . What Thompson 's move ' did mean was that he had finally been able to win what Texas independents want-promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily ) , giving Texas a bigger share of the domestic market . That ambition had been implicit in Thompson 's Washington testimony . The way to supply Europe was not to increase production , he said , but to make major refiners cut back imports of Venezuelan crude , ship it direct to Europe . <P> To carry out this mission , Thompson lunched with Presidential Assistant Sherman Adams and Defense Mobilizer Arthur Flemming , picked up Administration support for diverting Venezuelan crude . He also urged new pipeline capacity " in the interests of national security " from Texas to the East Coast , possibly Philadelphia , where natural gas now arrives from Texas in the war-built Little Inch pipeline . An application to convert Little Inch from gas to petroleum products is already before the Federal Power Commission from Houston Contractors George and Herman Brown , and is sure to get quick attention . <P> Tie-In . Though Texas had to be paid off before it moved , the resulting production boost will solve some problems for oil lifters . Jersey Standard Oil President M. J. Rathbone told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fuel oil for Europe , his buyers had to accept a tie-in deal from three refiners for 302,000 bbl. of " unwanted " gasoline . Yet so far , testified Rathbone , Jersey Standard has tailored its lift to Europe 's needs , shipped 20 million bbl. of crude , only 431,000 bbl. of gasoline . Asked the probers : Was the recent boost in crude prices made to protect the industry against a falling profit margin ? Yes , said Rathbone. noting that Jersey Standard 's profit percentage of net worth is slipping , dropped from 19.1% in 1951 to 15.8% in 1955 . Though Jersey Standard 's profits will rise $100 million in 1957 to $900 million , it must also keep pace with rising world demand . Expansion will take $3 for every $2 of 1956 earnings . " Our profits are big , " said Rathbone , " but we also do a big job . "
