One of the surest ways a board of trustees can anger the faculty of a college or university is to pick as president a man who has never 1 ) been a scholar , 2 ) earned a Ph.D .. or 3 ) taught a class . Last week the trustees of the Consolidated University of North Carolina picked just such a man-but not a single professor voiced even a hint of an objection . <P> The man the trustees picked to run their three campuses ( the University at Chapel Hill , the State College of Agriculture and Engineering at Raleigh and the Woman 's College at Greensboro ) is William Clyde Friday . 36 . Born in Dallas , N.C. , he took a degree in textile engineering at State College in 1942 . After serving in the Navy , he went back to the university for a law degree . In 1951 President Gordon Gray , onetime Secretary of the Army ( Truman Administration ) , made him his special assistant . Last March , four months after Gray resigned to devote full time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his man Friday became acting president . The appointment was to be only temporary : for its permanent president , the university wanted a name with a good deal more academic prestige . <P> As the months passed , the university began to change its mind . Partly because of Gordon Gray 's long absences , the three campuses had lost some of their former stature , and each was torn by faculty bickering . The medical school and affiliated North Carolina Memorial Hospital blamed each other for the hospital 's mounting deficit . At Raleigh , the engineering , physics and mathematics departments were at each other 's throats over who would be in charge of the new nuclear reactor . Meanwhile , at Greensboro , the campus was split down the middle because of an overeager chancellor 's efforts to reform the curriculum . <P> With unruffable good nature , Friday swept all these problems away . He placed the medical school and hospital under one man . shifted a few professors around at Raleigh , managed to get the Greensboro chancellor to resign . He restored the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man for the presidency . " He is the kind of person , " said one professor , " who can humanize the scientists and Simoniz the humanists .
