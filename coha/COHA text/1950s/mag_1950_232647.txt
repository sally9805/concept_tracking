From Peking south to Canton , belligerent Red China shouted new watchwords : " Beware of burrowing ! Beware of air raids ! " Burrowing meant the anti-Communist underground . Retaliatory U.N . air raids seemed a grim possibility in the Red mind ; like prudent , undaunted soldiers , the aggressors in Peking were preparing for the worst . <P> Camouflage paint was decreed for all tall buildings in Canton . Merchants were told to ship inflammable goods inland . Industrial machinery and commodities were also being transferred . Plans for dispersal of the city 's 1,000,000 population were reported . The families of Red officials were trekking to Kukong , 150 miles up the Canton-Hankow railway . <P> " Resist America " propaganda and mobilization mounted in clamor and fury . In Nanking a U.S. missionary teacher was publicly humiliated . In Shanghai , U.S. movies were branded as " spiritual poison . " In Canton a doctors ' rally pledged a boycott of U.S. medicines . Everywhere students were recruited for military service . Peking 's Current Affairs Journal instructed the faithful : " Hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese people . Despise the U.S. , for she is a rotten imperialist nation . . . Look with contempt on the U.S. , for she is a paper tiger and can fully be defeated . . . " The Journal added that China should not fear superior U.S. resources . " This superiority , " it explained ominously , " is only temporary . . . After the Communist liberation of Western Europe , the total steel production of the Soviet Union and its allies will reach 67 million-odd tons , which means almost a parity with the amount produced in the U.S. "
