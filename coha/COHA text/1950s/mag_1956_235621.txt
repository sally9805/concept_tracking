A rare smile lit the stony face of South Africa 's Nationalist Prime Minister Johannes Strydom last week . After five years of relentless campaigning , this taut , thin-lipped , back-country lawyer and ostrich farmer had won the parliamentary fight to establish white supremacy in a land of 2,600,000 whites and 10,000,000 nonwhites . Its Upper House now packed with 41 new , Strydom-created Senators to furnish the necessary votes , Parliament bowled heavily through a final joint session to change an " entrenched clause " in the 1909 South African constitution and strike the last 45,000 Colored ( mixed blood ) voters from the common voting roll . Strydom's-majority : 174 to 68 . <P> Some of the younger Nationalists and their wives thought the occasion called for a gesture of thanks to their leader . They organized a victory march on Groote Schuur ( Great Barn ) , the vast Dutch Colonial pile , once the mansion of Empire Builder Cecil Rhodes , that is now the Cape Town residence of the Prime Minister . Around 9 of the summer 's evening , a caravan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives , drove slowly up to the great house whose grounds overlook two oceans . " We have come to sing , " announced a spokesman . Mrs. Strydom invited the crowd inside , ordered the kitchen blacks to prepare coffee and Boerebiskuit ( Afrikaans for shortbread ) for all . As the Prime Minister came into the hall a moment later , the visitors broke into old Boer war songs-the Volksliederen of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State . Then the Senate 's only woman member , Mrs. M.D.J. Koster , spoke her thanks to the white race 's savior : " Every white woman and every white mother thanks you from the depths of her heart . " Deeply moved , Strydom wiped a tear from his cheek , then replied : " We must never be swerved from our goals . . . The struggle must continue . "
