" If railways could be built in Sinkiang , Manchuria , Tibet and Mongolia , and if all these railways could be linked into one system , " said Sun Yat-sen long ago , " then China 's people would have cheap food to eat . " Red China and the Soviet Union are now building Sun Yat-sen 's railroads , with a notably different purpose . They mean , by 1957 , to bring Communist power by rail into Asia 's heartland , to forge new steel bands across the world 's greatest continent and to consolidate their grand alliance . <P> By Western standards , China has never been a railroad nation . Its peak total mileage never exceeded 16,700-against the U.S. 's 395,800 . Its railroads , built mostly by the British and Japanese , serviced the coastal provinces and industrial Manchuria , and one-third of these lines were knocked out during the war with the Communists . Last week , from TIME 'S bureau in Hong Kong , a city where the free world gets its best peek through the slits in the bamboo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reds have done and hope to do about the railroads . <P> Work Comes First . The Communists first restored the old networks , then probed out into the great , windswept Northwest . Their objective as such was not economic but strategic , i.e. , to get direct new communications with Russia . To this end . the Communists relentlessly dragooned hundreds of thousands of peasants from their homes to the railroad sites . Soviet experts gave them an Orwellian slogan : " Work comes first . Time comes first . If time is lost , all is lost . " <P> In the summer of 1952 , the Communists completed the first new line on the way to Russia , a 314-mile stretch between Chungking and Chengtu ( see map ) . That fall they completed a 216-mile roller coaster across 1,000 bridges and viaducts from Tienshui , terminus of the old main line from the coast , to Lanchow , the heart of the " New Northwest . " The Communists are now at work on at least twelve more strategic railroads , more than 4,000 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two places . Among them : <P> The Lanchow-Sinkiang Railroad : Red China has laid down 200 miles of this projected 1,200-mile line , northwest from Lanchow towards Russia . The Russians are building southeast to meet the Chinese . The job has Red China 's top priority . " The workers are moving mountains and filling rivers at an altitude of 9,000 ft. , " Peking recently crowed . " They are battling ice floes and swift currents in sub-zero weather . " The Lanchow-Sinkiang will give Russia its fastest connection to the Pacific . ( The Moscow-Peking journey now takes nine days via the aging Trans-Siberian Railroad and Red China 's existing networks . ) The new line will also give Red China its best route to the Soviet Union 's industrial area . <P> The Suiyuan-Mongolia Railroad : Red China will run this projected 600-mile line from the Paotow region to Ulan Bator , Outer Mongolia 's capital , and the Trans-Siberian beyond . This will be Russia 's second new main line to Peking .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
