txt Speaking in defense of price controls the other day . Mobilizer Charles E. Wilson was reported by the New York Times to have posed this question : " Has anyone got another plan . . . for keeping inflation under control ? " Well , we have such a plan . But first , since so many discussions of inflation suffer from vague terminology and mixed-up definitions , perhaps we had better set forth more precisely what is this inflation we are talking about . And maybe make a guess or two at what Mr. Wilson is trying to talk about , too . Judged by its context , Mr. Wilson 's question was based on the theory that rising prices , or anyway the tendency of prices to rise , constitutes inflation . What he wants to stop is rising prices , or anyway the tendency of prices to rise too rapidly . So , though he professes to dislike price controls in principle , he sees no other method of dealing . with " inflation " ? his concept of inflation ? except to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than such-and-such .. If one . ere to accept Mr. Wilson 's definition that rising prices is inflation . it 's easy to see how some such direct attack on prices themselves might seem a logical remedy . But even accepting this definition and this approach , some difficulties pop up . The first difficulty of this approach is that even to make it work by its own theory all prices would have to be put under control  --  the prices for all goods . services and labor however seemingly remote or minute . For this sort of inflation obviously affects all prices . If you fix some by edict and leave others free you only twist the economy into an unmanageable shape . In short , you have to have a completely controlled economy . The second difficulty is that after you accept the theory that what you are trying to do is just to keep prices from being " too high " you have no way of deciding what is " too high . " Even at the present ceiling levels many prices are " too high " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and reduce the price of an article from a dollar to ninety cents , why not reduce it to eighty-five cents , or fifty cents ? If the thing can be done , it occurs to us to suggest that the present ceilings are not nearly low enough , the control rules not strict enough . In other words , if you were to follow this approach then the thing to do would be to apply price rules to everything and roll the ceilings back to whatever level is necc .. , sary to wring all of the " inflation " out of the economy . But this , of course , is not the plan we intend to suggest . It is a sidetrack which Mr. Wilson has invited us to explore ; if it leads to an absurdity , it is because once you start on this approach , absurdity is the only place you can get to . Yet this is-the sidetrack to which wethink that the national effort to deal with a serious economic problem has been switched . This misdirection , we think , comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation but have given the name to something else and then proceeded to try to deal with the something else . To get at the problem we need a clearer definition of " inflation . " And with it , a clearer idea of what is meant by " control . " Inflation is a monetary phenomenon . It stems solely from an extraordinary increase in the supply of money . Whether that money supply is augmented by clipping coins , by printing press currency like greenbacks , or by bank deposits based on government securities is immaterial . We have inflation only when we have the phenomenon of an increased supply of money units . Since the basic fact of inflation is an inflated money supply , the tendency of prices to rise as the supply of goods and services is measured in a more plentiful monetary unit is only a symptom of inflation . Just as a rising temperature is an indication of infection , so rising prices are an indication that inflation is affecting the economy . But rising prices are by no means the inflation itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a , different light . It is then possible fo devise a rational and effective approach to the problem of inflation . On the face of it , price control can then be seen as no way to deal with inflation . It is not only no answer to inflation : it is almost irrelevant . And hence Mr. Wilson is not really asking for " another " plan . Because he is missing the point . what he pronoses is not a plan for dealing with inflation at all . Since inflation is a monetary matter , then nothing at all in the way of a " control " in non-monetary fields can he applied as a remedy . Indeed , it ought to he clear that " control " is not the desired word . What we want is " prevention . " or , failing that , the ending of inflation . In our opinion , the thing to do about inflation is not to have it . Or anyway , not to have any more of it . This is not an impossible task : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the impossibility of Mr. Wilson 's way . All that is necessary is a conscientious national effort by the Administration to stop financing Treasury deficits by pumping government securities into the banking system . We certainly agree with Mr. Wilson that inflation " is an enemy possibly even more dangerous than Russia . " But it is an enemy that can be conquered . If the government will stop inflating the money supply , there will simply no longer be a problem of controlling the runaway prices which Mr. Wilson calls inflation .
