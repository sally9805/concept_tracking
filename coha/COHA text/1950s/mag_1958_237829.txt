When the Boston Symphony toured Russia two years ago , the members of the string section heaped praise on Russian Violinist David Oistrakh , who had played with the orchestra during his U.S. tour . Russian musicians countered with a standard response : wait until you hear Leonid Kogan . In Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall last week Violinist Kogan turned up with the Boston to demonstrate what his countrymen were talking about . <P> When he threaded his way through the orchestra , his 1707 Stradivarius at his side , 5 ft. 5 in . Violinist Kogan looked as though he could never work his short arms through the pyrotechnic bowings the music called for . But when he started to play Brahms 's Violin Concerto , he proved that , like the other Soviet soloists who have visited the U.S. since the war , he had all the technique he needed and some to spare . The familiar music poured from his bow in purling , honey-sweet ribbons of sound . His inflections were a marvel of etched sensitivity , his pianissimos feathery light , his fortissimos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kogan played the concerto with no apparent effort , smiled shyly to a thunderous ovation , which brought both audience and orchestra to their feet . Said he modestly : " The piece has plenty of technical difficulties to entertain the audience . " <P> Violinist Kogan , 33 , started tangling with technical difficulties as a seven-year-old prodigy in Dnepropetrovsk , was soon tagged as a good cultural investment , entered the Moscow Conservatory to study under Abram Yampolsky . In 1951 he burst spectacularly on the international musical scene by winning Belgium 's Queen Elisabeth Concours against the best young talent of the West . Now married to Elizabeth Gilels , younger sister of famed Pianist Emil Gilels and a fine violinist in her own right , Kogan is something of a musical hero in Russia . To the impressed men of the Boston string section last week , he seemed to lack some of the interpretive maturity of 49-year-old Violinist Oistrakh ( with whom he studied briefly ) , but all agreed that Kogan was playing in the same rarefied league . " He 's among the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burgin . " He ranks with the best . "
