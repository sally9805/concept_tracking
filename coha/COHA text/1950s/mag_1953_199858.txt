One of the riskiest experiments an art patron can make is to set a course that keeps him right up with the advance guard ; too often the most beckoning highway turns out to be a blind alley . But Collector Edward Root , * a retired college professor with a tidy inheritance to dispose of , is one U.S. art patron with faith in young painters , and especially young U.S. painters . At Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum of Art , where 132 of Collector Root 's pictures were on exhibit last week , art lovers got a chance to see how well he had followed the changing course of U.S. art since the turn of the century . <P> Root bought his first oil painting in 1907 , when he spent his $250 savings on a picture he liked . " It was the first time , " he says , " that I was conscious that art makes an appeal to the emotions instead of the intellect . " Emotions have been Root 's guide ever since . In the days when Paris ' moderns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painters as George Luks , John Marin , Edward Hopper , and Charles Burchfield , who was still designing wallpaper in 1929 when Root first saw his work . <P> During the late ' 30s , Root slacked off his buying . But after World War II , he started picking up samples of the new abstract art . He was one of the earliest to buy Theodoros Stamos ' dreamily delicate work , Jackson Pollock 's paint-spattered canvases , and Mark Tobey 's cool , almost Oriental calligraphy . <P> Lately Root has gone to England for some of Britain 's best moderns . The Metropolitan show has a dark and gloomy landscape by Romanticist John Piper , examples of Graham Sutherland 's thorny fantasies and Ben Nicholson 's thin , surgical curves and angles . At 68 , and feeling his age . Root has no idea whether the abstractionists he is now buying will eventually become recognized masters or not . But he thinks it is worth the gamble . " How else can a painter live ? " he asks .
