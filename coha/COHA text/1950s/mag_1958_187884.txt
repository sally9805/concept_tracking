THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN , by Pierre Boulle ( 281 pp. ; Vanguard ; $3.50 ) , is another one of those novels that try to prove that good and kind Americans are really dumb Americans . Ironic Frenchman Boulle ( The Bridge over the River Kwai ) is too blas to join forces openly with embittered Briton Graham ( The Quiet American ) Greene , but he makes it plain in his book that there is no place for naive , warmhearted U.S. do-gooders in cold-war country . True to his Gallic instincts , he makes his American boob a woman . Patricia is the wife of a Frenchman who expertly runs a rubber plantation in Malaya , not far from Singapore . He married her during a leave in the U.S. and loves her dearly , but while he sensibly oversees operations with a machine gun in hand , Patricia is convinced that love and decency are the real weapons needed to bring the Communist guerrillas to peace . When she practically adopts Ling , a Chinese Communist girl and a very nice dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Author Boulle has a field day trying to prove that men are men , women are women , and do-gooder females do not know East from West even when they are facing in the right direction . <P> DESERT LOVE , by Henry de Montherlant ( 203 pp. ; Noonday ; $3.50 ) , is convincing proof that the crudest hands a fictional Frenchman can fall into are those of a French novelist . Lucien Auligny is the creation of Author Montherlant ( Perish in Their Pride , Pity for Women ) , who at his gentlest tells nothing less than the bitter truth and at his worst dismisses humanity with a sardonic jeer . Lucien is a lieutenant who commands an oasis outpost in French North Africa . He is not much of a man and not much of a soldier , and boring desert duty with a handful of French and Arab troops is just what is needed to show him up all the way . The catalytic agent that calls his variety of weaknesses into play is an affair with Ramie , an adolescent Arab girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to think that he loves the Arabs and wants to understand them . Yet all the time he really only uses Ramie to fill an emotional vacuum , just as she is simply using him to get money . Montherlant finished Desert Love ( part of a longer novel ) in 1932 , made only minor additions for this version . The book does not show its age . The novel 's tortured , indecisive lieutenant could easily have his counterparts at many a desert outpost today . Clashes of civilization and the cracks they reveal in the conqueror 's armor are no more out of date than Montherlant 's sharply written novel .
