A FRIENDLY TALK I 4 ET T ERS came for her so seldom that the sight of the buff envelope lying just inside the door when she came in from her set walk gave her a shock , only half pleasant . As she stooped for it she saw , with another light shock , that it came from the BBC . Before she could stop herself she had thought : They want me to write for them . . , , She wrung the neck of this idea at once . . . . Idiot . They want to quote a line from a book  --  or they 've made a mistake .... She stretched her hand out toward her spectacles  --  and drew it back again . One of her vanities was to be able , at her age , and although it made her head ache , to react without them . Others were her straight back and nearly unlined throat . Innocent vanities . . . almost vital to a woman so little conceited that she had guillotined her career as a novelist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its resilience , its once feverish energy .... Why should I force the poor creature to go on jumping A Story by STORM JAMESON Drawings by Torn Keogh through the hoops with its stiffening joints ? Leave that to the young .... She had just enough money , if she turned over every penny twice , to live without working , and if she hid herself in a village . She had never been a fashionable writer , but she had been well enough known . Perhaps it stung her to discover how little time it took for her to be forgotten , completely . No critic imagined it would do him any good to mention her name ; even her publisher , after a few polite inquiries , seemed woundingly content to let a sleeping dog lie . Her London friends , too . . She did not make friends easily . Besides her husband , with whom she had been in love until the day of his death , she had had one close friend , As close to her as her childhood , as her restless wasteful furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once too intelligent and too pigheaded to let herself feel sorry that she had turned her back so recklessly on what might have remained to her  --  for a few more years  --  of celebrity , a modest celebrity . If now and then an infinitely small jet of bitterness broke the surface of her mind , she thought at once : It would have happened in any case the moment I died . . . why not before then ? Just the same , she had to crush down an excitement when she opened the envelope , turning it over once again to look at the address  --  Mrs. Sarah Ecnner , The White Cottage , Enham . So far no mistake . " Dear Mrs. Jenner , you may have listened to one or more of the talks " ? if I had a wireless , I might ? " in the series , ' A Friendly Talk , ' in which two women discuss , freely and not too solemnly , any topic or topics which interest them . I wonder whether you would care . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of lines lower , of the other woman , the woman they proposed as her partner in this talk . Trembling , she sat down in the nearest chair .... But why could n't they have asked just me ? Am I as old hat as that ? And why Elizabeth ? Of all people . Could n't they find anything better ? .. . A mocking smile crossed her mouth as she thought : Perhaps they felt how amusing to trot out two relics of the past .. .. Forget it , forget it . She had trained herself so severely never to let the image of Elizabeth enter her mind that she felt as guilty as a child caught with fingers in the honey to be thinking of her now . It forced her to think , too , about her husband  --  since it was at his funeral she had last seen Elizabeth . They had cried together , then Elizabeth had gone home for the weekend : she was to come back on Tuesday  --  but , on Tuesday , . . . Fifteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reddish brown , and curling ? It must be gray . And , almost certainly , she 'll have put on weight , living in Devon . She was always greedy , and lazy , with that careless slovenly charm  --  so much charm that she had only to say , " Pass the salt , " for every person within hearing to smile with pleasure . Just as she had only to glance at inc from the corner of her eye , in a boring gathering , for ns both to be seized by the same idiotic gaiety as when we were children sitting together at the end of the pew in church , hiding our crazy laughter under our hands , as though praying . Just as , with a gesture of her long fingers , she could call back the whole of our childhood and youth in a village sunk in a fold of the northern moor , the wind from the sea pouring through the branches of pines bent all one way by its weight .. . She was a better writer than I was . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly lazy . . . . Is that  --  her laziness  --  why , for more than ten years , she has written nothing ? Absolutely nothing . She is as forgotten now as I am . She always said : Why do I bother to write when I can fill every moment of my life without all that trouble ? Ah .. . A familiar jealousy , a familiar Jove , a familiar grief , seized her . She let it pinch her for a moment , then stood up resolutely and walked to the desk which served now only to hold a mug filled with wild flowers , and , moving this aside , wrote a polite brief letter . " Dear Miss " ? What is the name ? Head . Cordelia Head . I suppose , a young woman ? " Dear Miss Head , I shall be delighted to come to London , as you suggest , on the twentieth , to record a talk with Miss Elizabeth Hume . I only wonder a little why you . . . . " S H E walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense and undistinguished , of Broadcasting House to the desk in the corner . " My name is Jenner . I have an appointment for three o'clock with Miss Cordelia Head . " " Miss Head ? And the name is ? ? " " Jenner . Mrs. Sarah Jenner . " " Will you take a seat ? I 'll let Miss Head know . ' She sat down and looked quickly and cautiously round the hall . It was almost empty . One small group  --  a youngish woman talking with overdone vivacity to three young men , their cheeks as it were swaddled in beards . A few strays like herself , . . . A minute past three . She is n't here . Still utterly incapable of getting herself anywhere on time . A young woman , remarkably slender , with a smooth ' sallow face , stepped out of one of the lifts and walked briskly to the desk . The girl behind it pointed discreetly . She turned , with a polite professional smile . " Mrs. Jenner ? " She moved to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we wait here , to collect Miss Hume ? I hope she 's corning . " " Do n't you know ? " " Oh , she said she would come . But her letter was a little vague , and I was n't sure she realized that we have to work more or less to a timetable . But I 've allowed a margin . I was so glad you could come , both of you . " " She 's never punctual . " " You know her well , of course . " " I used to . " A slight roughness in her tone caught the 46 A FRIENDLY TALK young woman 's ear  --  as it might have been caught by the noise of a pencil rolling off her desk . Without interest , she asked , " You do n't see much of her now ? " " She lives in Devon . I live in Kent . " " Ah , yes . " The pencil had been picked up and put in its place . " Why ? " Sarah Jenner began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her work ? " Eyes a little distractedly turned toward the street door , Miss Head murmured , " To tell you the truth , no . We were rather running out of names for this series , and my friend said . . - he 's a great reader , he gets through scores of books every week ... he took out one of her novels from the London Library , and he said ? " a scarcely perceptible shadow , like a fish moving on the bed of a stream , gave away the coolly polite exaggeration ? " that it was splendid , and why not get her to do one of the talks . - So . . . " Mrs. Jenner gave her a glance the missing Elizabeth would have recognized , charged with a malice younger than anything in the young woman 's character . " He said , you mean : This really is n't at all bad . So that 's why you asked her . I wondered . " A light premonition . . . Have I made a bloomer ? Do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind . It vanished at once . With what she supposed to be an adroit stroke , she said , " In fact , I asked her before I wrote to you . It was she who suggested asking you . She said she admired you immensely , your novels , particularly . . now , which was it ? Oh , yes ? . Hidden Duel . Brilliant , she said . " " Kind of you to tell me , " murmured Sarah . " And so kind of her . " Her smile became frankly , exasperatedly derisive . " Kinder than you know . That particular novel was written about her . " " Oh ? " " I wrote it three years after my husband 's death . That is , three years less a week after I found out that she had been his mistress for years . Many years . " The young woman 's professional training had covered a great many risks : how not to offend the great and conceited , how to handle excitable foreigners , what to do when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Messiah  --  this happens quite often : something to do with the voice of God on the air . She had not been shown  --  and nothing in the shallows of her experience helped her  --  any way of outfacing a cynically amused mockery of herself and her want of tact . How horrible the old are , she thought , taken aback . " I 'm so sorry , " she said thinly . " 1 would n't have asked ? " " Oh , do n't worry . I do n't mind in the least meeting her . " Liar . You arc lying . You do n't even know what you 're saying to this sallow little goose . " It happened so long ago , I . . . There she is . Just coming in . D' you see ? " With relief , Miss Head jumped up to go and claim the woman dawdling across the hall . . . . Does n't she know she 's a quarter of an hour late ? But she looks  --  thank God  --  sane . Pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elizabeth Hume .1 had , as they say , let herself go . She was as tall as her friend , and shapeless ; even the oval of her face had become a round pale moon , the narrow eyes like the bright edges of knives , the head covered with gray curls , as untidy as though she cropped them herself with the scissors she used for pruning roses . A long mouth , its smile showing white evenly set teeth , obviously her own , a long chin , an almost absurdly small nose , . . . The envy Sarah felt was purely without vindictiveness .... I shall never reach that point of indifference , that  --  superiority . . . . The exercises she went through painfully each morning to keep herself supple were suddenly ridiculous , vulgar . " You know each other , " Miss Head said , with a trace of nervousness . " Very well , " Elizabeth Hume answered . She looked down gravely at the other woman , who had not moved from her seat . " How are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be absurd , " Sarah said . " Fifteen years . . . at our age . . . . I 've changed as much as you have . " Elizabeth laughed , a muted sound coming from deep in her heavy body . Neither this laugh , nor her voice , her low warm voice , its very flaws part of its seduction , had aged at all . " At least you have n't put on flesh . I 'm quite gross . I 'm always giving up cream , and I always begin on it again at once . " " Shall we go upstairs ? " By adopting the manner and tones of a governess , the young woman hoped to induce , if not respect  --  one should n't ask too much  --  submission and good conduct in her elderly charges . She led them briskly to an upper floor , and along corridors full of a stifling sluggish air , into a small room so exactly what you imagine secreted behind the net curtains of genteel weedy little houses that , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight . " I 've ordered some tea for us . I expect you 'd like some . " " Tea ? " Elizabeth drawled . " Well , yes . Too early for anything else . " " We can talk over a little what you 're going to discuss  --  before I take you to the studio for the recording . You 've broadcast before , of course . " " I have , " Sarah said .. " Once . Twenty years ago . " The emptily professional smile again . " I was n't here then , I 'm afraid . " " You were in your cradle . " " Not quite . . . . Wo n't you eat a biscuit ? .. . Now " ? she turned to Elizabeth ? " I rather liked one of the topics you suggested in your letter . Should women settle down in middle age , or should they try to strike out ? I wonder what you , Mrs. Jenner , think . " " Did n't I suggest anything ? " Sarah said coldly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trifle esoteric for our listeners , I thought . We ca n't , you know , fly too high . " " I always said you were too intelligent , " Elizabeth murmured . " Really ? Yet you did n't have any trouble  --  you and George  --  in making a fool of me . " In narrowing her eyes Elizabeth produced the effect of a cat averting its face from an indiscreet human stare . " You know it was n't anything of the sort . " " I do n't know anything ! I do n't know how you managed to trick me for so many years , or when it began , or anything . " " If you had asked me . .. " " Why should I imagine you would tell me the truth ? " " If you had asked inc about it at the time you found out , " Elizabeth said gently , " instead of telling me never to come near you again , I would have told you everything . Now I 've forgotten . " " Forgotten ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forget everything . " Miss Head spoke in an indulgent come-comechildren voice . " Are n't we forgetting the important thing ? We were deciding what topics you might talk about in " ? site had been going to say , " in a friendly way , " but a first grain of delicacy checked her ? " in a few minutes . We have the one topic , which perhaps you would like to explore for a moment while I ... while I make a few arrangements . . . excuse me . " Shc felt an overwhelming need to get away from them for a minute . With a rapidly sinking heart , she reflected that this was perhaps going to be the first fiasco , and a grotesque one , of the series . Her vanity was involved . Outside , in the corridor , she caught the arm of a friend who was passing , and said in a despairing voice , " My dear , they 're impossible . I ca n't tell you . " " Who ? " " These two old girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sarah Jenner ? My mother used to adore her novels . She was always boring me with them . " " I wish your mother were having to deal with her now . I must go  --  I shall probably find one of them just chewing the last bone and whiskers of the other . Incredible . " 0 P E N I N G the door nervously , site found complete harmony . Elizabeth was saying , " The delicious thing about growing old is that you no longer care what anyone thinks about you . For the first time , you can risk being yourself , not the timid hypocrites we were brought up to be , you and I. " " You were never timid . " " Yes . Yes , I was . Even now . . . Dare you cross your knees in public ? I dare n't . The voice of Aunt Alicia reaches me from her grave . ' No decent girl sits in that attitude . An immodest sitter is an abomination unto the Lord . ' And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah , what do you do to keep yours ? Oh " ? she had caught sight of Miss Head at her elbow ? " how much longer need we go on rehearsing ? If this is a rehearsal . You know , we sha n't want to say the same things twice  --  once here and again when we 're on the air . " " There 's something in that , " Miss Head agreed . The changed atmosphere had raised her hopes . She smiled , an almost personal smile , such as she gave herself when she passed a wall-mirror . " And you 've just started another interesting idea . The pleasures of growing old . " " Can you , " Sarah Jenner asked , " at your age , believe there are any ? " " Indeed , yes , " Miss Head lied . " Wonderful . " Is she laughing at sue again ? Miss Head asked herself uneasily . She dropped back into her manner of an indulgent governess , trusted and admired by her little charges . " Shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . But it 's quite simple . You have only to talk  --  as if you were sitting together over a clip of tea . " 48 A FRIENDLY TALK " Oh , not tea , " Elizabeth murmured . " This way . " As she seated them , facing each other , microphones between them , across the table , she noticed that Mrs. Jenner 's hands were shaking . . . Scared . Poor old thing . Let 's hope she does n't dry up . . . . A glass partition divided the small studio from the smaller anteroom where another young woman was waiting to try out their voices . " Please speak now . A few words . Anything . " " Do I have to stare at this thing all the time we 're talking ? It 's not inspiring . " " No , Mrs. jenner , you can look at Miss Hume , but you must n't shift about on your chair . " " Sarah , do you remember when you were Admetus in the end-of-term play ? I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : ' Oh face , oh form , of my beloved wife . ' . . You never got beyond ' Oh face ' ? we began to giggle and went on until they had to bring the curtain down on us . " Sarah laughed . Miss Head went out and came back in a moment to say that Miss Hume 's voice was exactly right . She moved Sarah 's microphone nearer to her , told them carefully , in the simplest words , when the recording would start , listened for a moment to Elizabeth Hume 's voice saying , " Do n't you agree , Sarah , that at forty , a woman . . " and crept silently into the anteroom , her mind almost at rest . . ? . After all , they 're not quite cracked . And what a voice  --  like cream , like a cello , like a cat pouring itself across your ankles . . . Lulled by it , she closed her eyes  --  and opened them , shocked by a burst of brutal laughter in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have they been saying ? A M I really sitting opposite her , opposite Elizabeth ? Why did I let it happen ? I distrust her , I hate her , I. . . . Her throat felt as though she had swallowed a splinter of glass . .. . Do I hate her ? Or did I only want to see for myself that she is an old woman , a woman no man will ever fall in love with again , a clown , a caricature of herself ? Am I appeased now ? satisfied ? contemptuous ? ? she need n't have let herself become slack and shapeless  --  or so pleased to see her that I do n't care about anything else ? Do n't ask , do n't ask ! Leaning sideways to see past the microphones ? the very movement the young woman had warned her not to make  --  she said , " Yes , that 's all very well , but why should a woman , only because she has reached her fortiethbirthday  --  her fiftieth , for that matter  --  cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , active ? " ' ' Because it 's not important for her to interest other people . It never was . A young woman  --  because she wants to get married , or to be praised , or see her photograph in the magazines you read at hairdressers ' ? not tha . I go to a hairdresser now  --  imagines it is . By the time she is fifty . . . " " And her husband , if she has one ? " Sarah said icily , dangerously . " Is he supposed not to care whether she gets fat or not ? " " Even a husband is n't so important as the moment when you stretch your arms , yawn , and say : Now , thank God , I can take my shoes off . . . . How much d' you spend on face creams a year , Sarah ? " None of your business . " " Good business for someone . You 're much too smooth for your age  --  which is the same as mine . I take my cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veal , in souffles . " " Yes . I ' can sec you do , It shows . " Elizabeth laughed . After a moment Sarah joined her , on a louder jeering note , and they laughed together . Sarah struck the table with a doubled fist . " Your Aunt Alicia  --  abomination-unto-theLord  --  would have prescribed a corset for you like the ones she wore . Do you remember  --  eau-de-Nil satin , boned , almost to the knees , six pairs of suspenders . . . . " " No , that was my Aunt Thomas Clarkson , my father 's sister , the one who had the cats and the two mulberry trees , and gave us port and seed cake on Sunday morning after church . " " You see , " Sarah cried , " you do remember things ! It 's not true that you forget everything . " " Ah , yes , real things  --  I remember those . I forget the others . " The fever of excitement , jealousy , anger , longing , in Sarah 's veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on her . But it 's true ! Real things  --  yes . Real their young lives , the village , the smell of peat and wood-smoke , the bare boards of the schoolroom , the icy cold of bedrooms in her father 's gaunt stone house , the heat of August on the moor , the crazy laughter , the trust . Nothing since had had that peculiar flavor of freedom and happiness . Nothing since that violent young world had been as real , neither ambition , nor success  --  such as it was  --  nor the heartache , the scalding tears , the anger carefully-nursed , the months and years of useless bitterness . . . . She smiled at her friend , " D' you remember the way one took to get to the Burnt Mill ? ' ' " Yes , of course , " Elizabeth murmured . With a sudden confidence , with joy , they found themselves walking about their childhood , retracing paths known only to themselves , in bare feet crossing a stream , stopping to laugh , correct each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , Sarah became aware of Miss Head standing beside her , flushed , with an expression of anguish , holding a piece of paper she laid down under Sarah 's eyes . . . . Do n't sway from side to side to look at Miss Home . Do n't bang on the table . . . . Sarah brushed the note out of the way . She had not taken it in . It had no relevance to the minutes she was living through . All these years she had been alone , and now , , . now . . . . Miss Head vanished . Alter a short time , there she was again , speaking aloud , in a dry voice . " Did n't either of you notice that the recording was over ? " W 1 1 . ' H a violent start and a feeling of guilt , Sarah pulled herself together to attend to the young woman , whose voice conveyed something sharper than impatience . From Elizabeth 's expression she saw that she , too , felt guilty  --  she hurriedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle of two elderly and once well-known women hanging their heads before this absurd young female official . " Oh . No , I did n't notice . Then we can go now ? " " Yes , you can . " " I 'm afraid we made too much noise , " Elizabeth said . Miss Head made a dogged effort to smile . " Oh , it does n't matter , .. . rn take you downstairs . " In the lift , Elizabeth said gaily , " What time is it ? Five ? After five . Almost time for a drink , do n't you think ? By the time we reach my club . . . or would you rather go somewhere else , more amusing ? " " I 'm afraid I . . . perhaps some other day , " Miss Hcad said . Too late she saw  --  from the astonished glance , a blue flash under lowered eyelids , that Sarah jenner gave her , and from the other woman 's raised eyebrows  --  that it had never entered their heads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , " Sarah said , " you 've had quite enough of us . " Elizabeth yawned and asked , " When are you going to broadcast our talk ? " " Do n't be silly , " Sarah said , smiling , " she 's not going to use it . Did n't you realize that ? " " Is n't she ? Why not ? " Miss Head was saved , by the opening of the lift doors , from having to answer . She took a few stiff steps with them into the hall , shook hands , and watched them walk away , their very backs giving away an undeserved and unseemly happiness . She hurried hack to her room . A colleague who had been waiting for her asked , " What , my poor girl , have you done with your two old reprobates ? " " They 've gone off , arm in arm , as pleased as if they 'd been terribly clever . My God , it I thought I 'd be anything like it when I 'm their age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cynical , mocking , utterly unmanageable , and impossible . Imagine being like either of them !
