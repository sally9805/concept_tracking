txt The Wage Stabilization Board in effect told 90,000 striking oil workers today that it would not approve wage rate increases of more than 15 cents an hour , unless unusual circumstances were shown . It was a tactical move the board hoped would speed a settlement of the strike . It is understood that some of the big oil companies are willing to grant a 15-cent rise . The unions have been holding out for 18 cents , after originally demanding 25 cents . Labor members of the W. S. B. went along with the 15-cent ceiling , a probable indication that the strike leaders would bow to it . The 15-cent figure exceeds the amount allowable under Wage Board regulations by about 5 cents and therefore was made subject to approval by the Economic Stabilization Administrator , Roger L. Putnam . This approval was forthcoming . The vote in the board was 8 to 4 , with the public and the labor members in the majority . The industry members refused to go along with anything in excess of the cost-ofliving regulation , which would permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed itself by acting on one of the few agreements reached by the unions with an oil company . The employer is the Farmers Union Central Exchange of Laurel , Mont. , whose refinery employs 137 workers represented by Local 443 of the Oil Workers International Union . C. I. 0 . The agreement called for a gen // eral rate increase of 18 cents an hour ; an increase in the differential for the second shift from 4 cents an hour to 6 cents ; an increase in differential for the third shift from 6 cents an hour to 12 cents , and an additional paid holiday , making a total of seven such holidays a year . The board approved all but the general rate increase and set a maximum of 15 cents on that . Average pay in the industry now is about $2.10 an hour . Nathan P. Feinsinger , chairman of the Wage Board , said the " ruling will not necessarily control other settlements but may be helpful .

Changes in night shift differentials in other cases , however , will be ? subject to action by the board itself . Mr. Feinsinger said that the 15-cent rise was " fair and equitable and not unstabilizing . " Mr. Putnam agreed . Mr. Feinsinger said the regulations in question were written so that employers could give limited increases without coming to the board . That fact , he said , did not prevent them from asking the board to approve a larger amount , and it did not prevent the board from exercising its judgment and approving a larger amount , subject to the approval of the economic stabilizer . Mr. Feinsinger also said the board was " very careful to avoid any action that might be construed as pattern-making or endorsing industry-wide bargaining . " Nevertheless . he said , he would be surprised if the board 's action did not , have some effect on the disputes ' between the other oil companies and the unions .

That was voted down , 8 to 4 , with the public and the industry members in the majority . The industry members then moved for approval of the amounts allowable under Regulations 6 and 8 ( revised ) . That would have amounted to about 10 cents . The motion was lost , 8 to 4 , with labor and public members voting against it . The labor members tried for 161/2 cents and lost , and then moved for the 15 cents , which carried .
