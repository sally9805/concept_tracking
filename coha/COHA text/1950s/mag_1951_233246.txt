Shortly after dawn , seven men in a guarded room in Washington 's Department of Agriculture building crowded around a large metal bo. , with two heavy padlocks . One man opened the first lock , another the second . Then for almost five hours , they pulled sealed envelopes from the box , tore them open , and carefully tabulated reports from farmers all over the U.S. A few minutes before n , the guards unlocked the doors , admitted Agriculture Secretary Charlie Brannan . Once he had examined the totals , signed his name and marched out again , the doors were thrown open . In came a dozen reporters to get the Crop Reporting Board 's latest estimate of the size of the U.S. cotton crop . The estimate : 15.3 million bales . <P> Up &; Down . There was good reason for all the cloak &; dagger precautions . Nothing affects the market price of cotton more than the board 's prediction . A speculator who had the figure even an hour in advance could make a killing in the market . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its original estimate of a record 17.2 million-bale crop to 16.9 million bales and then cut it to 15.8 million in November , many a farmer was howling mad . Those who had sold at low prices felt cheated by the new estimate , which immediately started cotton prices rising close to the ceiling . Last week 's estimate was a full 11% less than the first crop report in August . The Agriculture Department said that instead of a glut , there will scarcely be enough cotton to satisfy the domestic demand . <P> The Agriculture Department is the first to admit that it needs better crop-reporting . The board makes its guess from reports by its 60 field representatives and 20,000 volunteer farmer-reporters , who send in information on acreage planted , soil moisture , weevils and weather . Before the war , the board sent out roving teams to cover the cotton belt and doublecheck estimates . They were equipped with " crop meters , " i.e. , gadgets attached to car speedometers which recorded the front footage of cotton planted . But in the past few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to $2.8 million ) , while the cost of the job has skyrocketed . The board has had to cut down its staff , eliminate most of its checkers . <P> Show of Hands . This year , frosts , long dry spells and labor shortages had caused farmers to abandon acreage , and that threw the estimate off . Many a farmer had also exaggerated the size of his planting , feeling that if acreage controls were put on again , 1951 might be used as a base year . In Chicago last week , at the annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation , cotton farmers complained bitterly . But Georgia Farm Bureau President Harry Wingate quieted them down . He asked how many farmers had sent in the area estimates from , which the Crop Reporting Board got its total . There was a big show of hands . Slightly abashed , most of the delegates agreed that the board was probably doing the best it could , passed a mild resolution asking only that " means to improve the accuracy of the estimates " be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
