The cowboy , the most durable and popular figure on the U.S. screen , has until recent years generally been dismissed by critics and film historians as an error of popular taste . But in French critical circles , the cowboy has long been regarded with deep solemnity . Many a longhaired Frenchman believes that the western film is Hollywood 's finest achievement , a kind of national folklore in the making . In a flood of recently published books and articles , Europe 's highbrow critics have been soberly examining the western and discovering in it virtues and complexities which even its most loyal fans never suspected it possessed . <P> There are eight " great themes " for westerns , according to Critics Jean-Louis Rieupeyrout and Andre Bazin. whose book , Le Western , ou le Cinema Americain par Excellence , is the most exhaustive of the new studies . The big themes ( based on a study of 150 westerns ) : 1 ) the birth of a nation , 2 ) gold prospecting , 3 ) the frontier and the great plains , 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and beasts , 6 ) the War of Secession , 7 ) Indian warfare , 8 ) representative westerners . <P> Social Document . Writes Critic Bazin : " The Corneilleian simplicity of the western scenario has often been parodied . It is true that it is easy to detect an analogy to Le Cid : same conflict between love and duty , same knightly deeds , resulting in the virgin consenting to forget the insults to her family . . . But this comparison is ambiguous : to mock westerns by evoking Corneille is also to point out their grandeur , a grandeur perhaps close to puerility , even as childhood is close to poetry . . . Everyone , children and simple men , recognizes the naive grandeur of western movies . Epic and tragic heroes are universal . . . The trek west is our Odyssey . " <P> But the postwar western is gradually moving away from " naive grandeur " toward social documentation and psychological detail , according to Jean-Paul Sartre 's monthly Les Temps Modernes : " The ' neo-western ' has developed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of ' black ' films and psychoanalytical films , westerns have enriched themselves with a clinical description of the half-crazy desperadoes who roam the desert . " Examples : Rawhide Ranger ( 1941 ) and Coroner Creek ( 1948 ) . <P> Accepted Symbol . " On a less dramatic level , " says Les Temps Modernes , " one liked the personality of Shane , that nostalgic outlaw of a Racine-like modesty , who troubled for a moment the wife of a farmer . . . The search for the everyday , true incident is hard to reconcile with the epic violence of the westerns , and here again there has been a radical change : the superman has been superseded by a ' new type ' of cowboy , who hesitates , who suffers and who is afraid . " Examples : The Ox-Bow Incident , Gun fighters , The Treasure of Sierra Madre .
