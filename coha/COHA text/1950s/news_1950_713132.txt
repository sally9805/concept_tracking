Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OP THE NEW YORK TIMES : During the defense period of 1940 and 1941 the Federal Government was better prepared to mobilize and control the economy than it is today . The reason was not that President Roosevelt possessed greater power than President Truman : if anything , Truman now has more authority than Roosevelt had then . The difference lies largely in the fact that Roosevelt did not wait for Congress to act , but used executive orders to set up the Office of Price Control and Civilian Supply , the Office of Production Management and the National Defense Mediation Board , to name only three of the executive order agencies of that period . It required far more authority than President Roosevelt was able to give them for these agencies and their successors to cope adequately with the situation they faced . Congressional authority was necessary ; but while it was being awaited the executive order agencies introduced some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience , and they got over some of their organizational difficulties . When statutory authority was conferred , going organizations were ready to utilize it without delay , and the economy was in better shape for war than it would have been without their attentions during the prestatutory period . No Nucleus for Boards Today , there are no equivalents to 0 . P. A. C. S. , 0 . P. M. and N. D. M. B. For a while some of the sponsors of the National Defense Act of 1947 thought that the National Security Resources Board would be the embryo of wartime economic control agencies . Arthur Hill , the first N. S. R. B. chairman , shared that notion , but he was opposed by the Cabinet members who composed the board and who were hostile to the creation of emergency agencies outside the old-line departments . The question came before the President , who decided in favor of his Cabinet members and directed the board to abandon any idea of becoming a nucleus of future organizations for economic mobilization and control . Lately some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wanting to revert to former Chairman Hill 's conception of the board 's mission . The National Security Resources Board is not , therefore , a control agency , and it appears to have no orders to become one . There is no organization whose responsibility it is to cajole or threaten business into rescinding price increases as Leon Henderson and his group often did during the period of jawbone price control . No organization exists that can take over rationing at once as 0 . P. A. did in 1942 . No organization is directing the flow of materials for industry . It is bad that the process of rearmament is getting no more direction and control than it is ; but it is worse that no organizations are now being shaped up to receive statutory authority when it is conferred . Time Element The Government is standing on its heels , waiting for Congress to act , when it ought to be getting into , a posture of readiness . Personnel for economic control agencies are not assembled nor organizations formed overnight . It takes time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct the situation tomorrow if he chose . He has as much authority as President Roosevelt had during the defense period , and he could doubtless find the funds to support at least skeleton organizations . All that is necessary is for him to issue the executive orders , and the Government could at once begin active preparation ? preparation that would count for something  --  for the economic mobilization and control that will probably come . OWEN S. STRATTON , Assistant Professor of Political Science . Wellesley , Mass. , Aug. 5 , 1950 . Security Council on Television TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I feel that employers should allow their employes one hour off to view on television the obstructive tactics of Malik each day in the Security Council . To see Malik and hear him use 1,000 words to say " No , " and to see his maneuvers and those of the Red satellites would be convincing enough to the American public that there in plain view is a group which has ganged up to sabotage every principle which we hold dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No " is that whatever has been proposed is " illegal . " He just wants to engage in filibuster , it is plain to see , because the next day when he comes in he never brings up the subject of what to him the day before was " illegal . " Public television sets should be set up in business districts , in parks , public squares , etc. , so the public can be aware of such Red tactics . AMERICAN CITIZEN . Brooklyn , Aug. 8 , 1950 . Tribute to Mrs. Dunlop TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Among the growing number of women who have informed themselves about city government in the past twenty-five years , Mrs. David B. Dunlop , who died last month , was outstanding .. Mrs. Dunlop 's close association with the Women 's City Club began when it was located at Thirty-fifth Street and Park Avenue in the beautiful corner house designed by Stanford White . By Arthur Krock is traveling . His column , " In the Nation , " will be resumed shortly . TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reston writes in THE TIMES of Aug. 6 that though the United States " had truth , morality and the law on its side in the ( Security ) Council chamber here this week , " it " apparently did n't do so well " on the propaganda issue . This he attributes , among other things , to the bad timing of General 's visit to Formosa . What Mr. Reston overlooks is that it is not the " timing " of this act that makes it bad propaganda ; it is the act itself , with all it implies . For many Chinese to whom Chiang Kai-shek is today no longer a hero it does n't matter at all whether General chooses to visit him one week or another . The key question in their minds is : " What is America up to now ? " They also wonder why , when the Korea crisis arose , America unilaterally reversed her previous hands-off ' policy in Formosa , thus indicating a relevance in her eyes between events in China and Korea , yet now refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crux of American policy in the Far East is well expressed by THE TutiES in its Aug. 5 editorial on Nehru 's recent speech , when it says apropos Indo-China : " Our contention ( is ) that the alternative to Bao Dai is communism . " The logical deduction is that though we may think Bao Dai is bad , we are willing to back him against communism , which is worse . Here , unfortunately , is where we part company from a growing proportion of the peoples of Asia .. After spending a recent year in China under both the Kuomintang and the Communists , I have no hesitation in saying that the bulk of the people there ( not the small upper crust which we Americans too often confuse with that bulk ) definitely preferred Mao Tse-tung , communism and all , to Chiang Kai-shek . The same preference as between similar alternatives would , I have no doubt , be shown by many other Asiatics in other countries , especially if , as in Korea , the price of resistance to communism is war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this : You may not like your Chiang Kai-sheks , Bao Dais , et al. , but you have got to put up with them because we know , even if you do n't , that the alternative is something worse . This sort of argument is futile because it implies the superior wisdom of those who make it , the use of compulsion against those who ignore it , and because it disregards ordinary human nature . It is like telling someone who is being cooked to death in a frying pan that he must n't jump out because if he does he wil ' fall into the fire . Most people , if they are told this , will resent the advice and take a chance on the fire . DERK BODDE , Professor of Chinese , University of Pennsylvania . Philadelphia , Aug. 7 , 1950 . Further Defining of Aggression To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE Triers : Edmund Ciuntu 's letter to THE TIMES sheds further light on Litvinov 's 1933 definition of aggression . But so far as I know there has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aggression made in 1944 by Stalin . Quite obviously referring to the German Fascists , the Generalissimo said on Nov. 6 , 1944 : " As history demonstrates , aggressive nations as invader nations are more prepared for a new war than peaceloving nations , which , not being interested in a new war , are usually late in preparing for it . It is a fact that ( in the Second World War ) the aggressive nations had ell ready , before the beginning of the war , an invader army . The peace-loving nations did not even possess a satisfactory defense army during mobilization. * * * " Aggressive nations interested in a new war , as nations preparing themselves for the war over a long period of time and gathering their forces for it usually a  --  e  --  and should be  --  better prepared for war than peace-loving nations . * * * This is natural and understandable . It is historical law . * * 80 , The very nature of the initial Communist invasion of the Republic of Korea on June 25 ? an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coupled with simultaneous amphibious landings on the east coast  --  would certainly indicate that , under Stalin 's definition , the Communists are without question the aggressors . REXFORD STEAD . Port Chester , N. Y. , Aug. 9 , 1950 . Praise for New York To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Although I had never visited New York before , I feel that I am no longer a stranger here . You have a clean city , with good American officials who believe in our Bill of Rights . You have a good Governor and a wonderful police force , and your citizens are most considerate of visitors . I come from Nebraska , and this is my first visit to New York City . I came as a Witness to a great convention , and I hope that there will be another held here again . H. J. YOUNG . Elwood , Neb. , Aug. 6 , 1950 . Organizing for Controls Executive Action Urged Preliminary to Setting Up Agencies the time the club moved uptown Mrs. Dunlop 's wide knowledge of the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of the juvenile offender , Charter revision and labor and industry , led to her appointment as executive secretary . When she resigned from that post in 1940 she was elected to the board of directors and took an active part on that board until shortly before her death . In the civic field her usefulness was widespread . She was associated with Mrs. Samuel A. Lewisohn and the Public Education Association during the last years of her life and was frequently consulted by individual members of the League of Women Voters and the Citizens Union , who held her in high esteem . Those of us who knew her best remember particularly that she had no interest in the limelight . At a dinner given in her honor when she had been with the Women 's City Club twenty years she made a speech high-lighting the achievements of a score of other club members . She never sought public recognition or fame and valued more the close bonds of friendship that developed between her and her associates . She will be sorely missed by scores of men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her purpose . MARY BALLARD DITRYEE , Honorary Vice President , Women 's City Club . New York , Aug. 8 , 1950 , Our Far Eastern Policy Attitude Toward Asian Governments Believed to Disregard Human Nature Idlewild System Criticized Handling of Incoming Passengers Considered Too Slow To THE EDITOR OP THE NEW YORK TIMID/ ' May I , as a visiting Englishman with an unbounded admiration for much that is American , draw attention to the amazing method of dealing with incoming passengers at Idlewild Air- , port ? Quite apart from the bad impression created in the minds of foreigners , I am surprised that Americans themselves have not rebelled et the unnecessary and irritating delays that are inseparable from the present ayetem in force . Why , for example , is it necessary to herd everyone into the quarantine room while one official deals slowly with them one at a time , United States citizens taking precedence ? Why can not the passengers move straight to a desk as they leave the plane , with different desks for citizens and foreigners functioning simultaneously , as in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idlewild , the whole proceedings were held up for ten minutes while an American who had failed to provide hitriself with the necessary certificate was vaccinated on the spot . ) Why can not one be dealt with at once on arrival in the Customs Department , instead of having to wait anything from twenty to forty minutes after handing over the documents ? Then , again , why can not arrangements be made to shorten the cumbersome procedure in the case of passengers merely transferring from one plane to another ? A fortnight ago I had three hours available for the change-over and spent two of them in the formalities of " getting in " and " getting out " of the same airport . Last night a lady of my acquaintance missed her outward plane because she was still sitting in the customs room when it departed , although Idlewild had been advised in advance of her bookings . Of the seventy-five minutes which elapsed between the arrival of my plane and my emergence from the airport less than two minutes were occupied in formalities before the officials who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached them . At Northolt Airport ( London ) , which handles the European traffic ( often for many hours a day at the rate of a plane movement every three minutes ) , it is unusual not to be completely cleared in ten to fifteen minutes . At Heathrow ( London Airport ) transatlantic planes of the stratocruiser type are cleared in half an hour . Surely the procedure at Idlewild can be speeded up . HALFORD W. L. REDDISH . New York , Aug. 9 , 1950 . Parking Meter Charge Queried To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The City Fathers , ever on the alert for the common good , have now decided to install parking meters . Having solved the subway and bus problem by increasing the fare 100 per cent , and having tacitly approved the decision of the Public Service Commission to increase the pay phone calls by 100 per cent , they will now supposedly solve the parking problem by having a minimum ten-cent meter charge . The dime has become the magic coin . The smaller towns and cities have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a five-cent per hour charge . Many of these even allow twelve minute parking for One cent for those who do n't want to park a whole hour , but New York City does everything on a big scale . The proposed area in the Bronx which will be metered is at least as much residential as business . Many a person , such as a doctor , who may have to make a number of calls in that region , will be penalized . The call may only take fifteen minutes , but a dime is what he 'll have to pay . Is the aim of this proposed measure to raise revenue , or prevent cars from pre-empting choice parking spots for a whole day ? STANLEY M. WERSHOF , M. D. New York , Aug. 9 , 1950.
