Behind the great arc that stretches from Shantung province on the Yellow Sea to the southern coast of Kwangtung province on the Gulf of Tonkin , the vast heartland of China was once more beset by its most ancient of enemies-flood and famine . From Kwangtung alone , refugees streamed into the refugee-packed British Crown Colony of Hong Kong at an officially counted rate of 100 a day ; how many others came across the Communist border uncounted , no one knew . In the nearby Portuguese colony of Macao , officials estimated that 20,000 Chinese refugees had fled their homeland in the past two months . Communist border guards , nominally under orders to shoot anyone attempting to flee Red China , now look the other way . <P> In Shantung the rivers I and Shu , tributaries of the great Yellow River , overflowed their banks , submerged millions of acres , destroyed the homes and farmlands of hundreds of thousands of peasants . Radio Peking , acknowledging the magnitude of the floods , said that 20,000 life-buoys and thousands of tons of food had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tributaries of the Yellow River burst their dikes , bringing the total area devastated by flood to more than 7,400,000 acres . <P> Peking announced that 2,000,000 workers had been pressed into flood-fighting work , carefully refrained from reporting death tolls ( estimated to run into scores of thousands ) , but eulogized nine party members killed while fighting flood waters in Kwangtung . In Shantung the rains fell steadily for a fortnight ; in Kwangtung and Kwangsi , in South China , it rained for 22 days . Shanghai reported the worst rains in 80 years .
