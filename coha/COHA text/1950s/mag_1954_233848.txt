When King Kamehameha III proposed statehood for Hawaii a century ago , he expected the U.S. to agree in about as much time as it takes to say King Kamehameha III . If alive , he would still be waiting-and partly because Hawaiian opinion itself is by no means unanimous for statehood . Some influential white residents , resenting the increasingly important part played by Japanese and Chinese in the island 's business and political life , point to a postwar Caucasian exodus and say Hawaii would become an " Oriental state . " Others argue that Hawaii should not be a state so long as Harry Bridges ' Red-led longshoremen hold a death grip on the island economy . <P> Even so , the vast majority of Hawaii 's people are foursquare for statehood , and it is in the U.S. Congress that the opposition , led by Democrats generally and Southerners specifically , has been most formidable . Last week , however , a Southern Democrat set Hawaii 's hopes to blooming like the white-petaled pikake . <P> Louisiana 's Senator Russell Long last spring voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple Alaska 's statehood with Hawaii 's and to hold time-consuming hearings on the qualifications of both territories . Long 's vote to delay action on Hawaii was in keeping with his political and sectional background . As a Democrat , he could be expected to insist that usually Democratic Alaska be admitted , along with traditionally Republican Hawaii . As a Southerner , he was prone to the fear that Hawaii would add new strength to the Senate 's civil rights forces . It was this combination of political expediency and prejudice that had long made the U.S. Senate a dead end for Hawaiian statehood . <P> But after the last session of Congress , Russell Long went to Hawaii , concluded that the territory 's thorough " Americanization in every respect " made it deserving of statehood . Last week Senator Long defined his new stand : he will vote for Hawaii 's statehood ( but probably not for that of relatively backward Alaska ) both in committee and on the Senate floor . With prospects for final passage good if the bill wins committee approval , Long 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come true .
