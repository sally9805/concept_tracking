txt Gov . Nel , ; on A. Rockefeller has unveiled a concept of economic growth to assure national prosperity and success in coping with the Soviet challenge . It is predicated on three conditions : 1 . That government must " manage its affairs soundly and on a businesslike basis , " thus providing a " framework of laws and services within which the individual , whether a private citizen or a corporation , can work with maximum freedom and usefulness to serve the growing needs of the nation . " 2 . That management and labor must " forgo further workweek reductions in favor of increased output of goods and . services. ? 3 . That a realistic approach must be made toward solving the " problems that come with automation " through the establishment of " a consultative body with representatives from labor , management , the public , and the Secretaries of Labor , Commerce , and Treasury " at the national level . Comparison ' Invited ' These opinions were contained in a major speech by the Republican Governor before the Economic Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and his party take off for a barnstorming political adventure on the West Coast . It was his first major utterance on the over-all economic picture . He told reporters after the address that he considered it an " interpretation " rather than " a recommendation , " yet it will be taken by most observers as a statement of substance by a prospective candidate for President . By intimation the New York Governor invited a comparison between what he had accomplished in his 10 months as chief executive of the Empire State , and the national problems . The budgetary and fiscal picture in January . 1958 , was very black . Six hundred thousand unemployed , industries fleeing the state , New York 's growth rate dropping below the national average , railroads in financial difficulties , bus companies failing . and an inherited budgetary deficit of almost $700,000,000 . Head-On Action Cited moved as rapidly as possible to meet the problems headon , " said Governor Rockefeller . Budget requests of the outgoing Democratic Harriman Administration were cut $281,000,000 ; additional tax revenues of $277 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation for the railroads and busses was passed ; favorable steps to encourage new business and hold old business were taken . And now New York State is in good shape , with a " balanced budget on the pay-as-yougo basis " for 1960 in sight , he indicated . The Governor 's main theme , however , was growth . He discounted Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev 's statement ( made from the same rostrum before the same audience ) that " the Soviet Union would outproduce the United States by 1970 . " Accepting the current rate of growth in each nation-4 per cent for the United States and 6 per cent for the Soviet Union ? Mr. Rockefeller declared that " neither Soviet per capita output nor their gross output would catch up with ours for half a century . " It was when Governor Rockefeller dealt with the " advantages of growth to the domestic economy " that he struck some political pay dirt . He would set sights for an increase from the current 4 per cent to a desirable 6 per cent rate of growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 50 per cent expansion of all government services . including defense , at tax rates ? federal , state , and local ? 15 per cent under current levels , " he said . Ears pricked up at this hope for a tax cut from such a realistic dealer with tax problems .
