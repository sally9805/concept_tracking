Blue-eyed , brunette Ellen Raphael Knauff , 35 , is the German-born war bride of a U.S. Army combat veteran . She is also an anti-Nazi who fled Germany and served as a wartime sergeant in the British WAAF . But she has not been able to gain admission to the U.S. When she came to Ellis Island 20 months ago , the Department of Justice 's immigration service excluded her as a security risk , without revealing the evidence against her or giving her a hearing . Last January , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the exclusion order without requiring the Department of Justice to disclose its evidence . Dissenting , Justice Robert Jackson called the exclusion " abrupt and brutal . " <P> More effective dissent to the Supreme Court 's action was written by Irving Dilliard , 45 , longtime student of the Supreme Court 's procedures and editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial page ( TIME , July 4 ) . In a series of 15 doggedly detailed editorials , he denounced the " star chamber proceedings " in the case of Knauff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat to the civil liberties of U.S. citizens as well . The P-D backed up his blasts with Fitzpatrick cartoons , news stories and full-page ads in the Washington Post and Star in which it retold the Knauff story FOR THE INFORMATION OF <P> OFFICIAL WASHINGTON . <P> <P> Last week the P-D 's determined campaign got action in official Washington . The House subcommittee on immigration gave Ellen Knauff her first full public hearing . Wearing a pert sailor hat and a smart suit , Mrs. Knauff made an appealing and convincing witness ; she blamed a jealous ex-sweetheart of her husband 's for spreading " gossip " that she was a spy . Offered an opportunity to submit its own evidence and to question Mrs. Knauff , the Department of Justice refused on the ground that it would jeopardize its intelligence sources . With no evidence against Mrs. Knauff , the committee unanimously reported out a bill directing the Attorney General to admit her to the U.S. In due course , she could expect to become a U.S. citizen , thanks to the Post-Dispatch and Crusader Dilliard.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
