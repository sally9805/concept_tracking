Early birds at the New York Athletic Club games in Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden last week knew just the man to watch . Down there among the " whales " whirling in their 7-ft. circle and heaving the 16-lb. , leather-covered shot , Air Force Lieutenant Parry O'Brien showed a style all his own . The hefty ( 6 ft. 3 in. , 235 Ibs . ) Californian turned his back to the toeboard , spun completely around before he put the shot with explosive energy . The results were astonishing : 57 ft. 11 in. ( good enough to win right from the start ) , then 59 ft. 4 in . After a momentary lapse with 58 ft. 8 in. , everything clicked : O'Brien put the shot 59 ft. 9 in. , setting a new world 's indoor record and giving fair warning of what to expect next fall in Australia . <P> Only after Parry finished did the track-wise crowd get a chance to settle down . The games expanded into the organized confusion of all indoor track meets . The pole vault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar passed 14 feet . Tobacco smoke gathered over the tight oval of the banked-board track while sweat-suited runners in their warmups jogged endlessly toward nowhere . Hurdlers twisted into weird calisthenics all over the infield . Here and there some exhibitionist dropped into a handstand , presumably to loosen his legs . Hordes of officials in boiled shirts hardly had room to get out of their own way . <P> Now and then , long-legged runners , stripped to their skivvies , lined up across the boards . The starter 's gun cracked . Flying spikes and wide-swung elbows jammed up on the turns . But even before the winners ' times were announced , the warmup boys were back on the track like late starters in the race just finished . <P> Sections of the track were periodically removed so that dashmen and hurdlers would have a clear lane to their finish line . High jumpers rolled over the bar . Seconds after they started , handicap relays were too confused for the casual fan ; runners were spread out over the track . And through it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tux-togged official rode high in the basket of a finger lift to replace the bar when someone missed . <P> Happily , long years of practice have made the dedicated track fan proof against the distracting discord on the floor . Somehow he can spot his favorite in the welter of colored sweat suits . Last week Parry O'Brien was not the only record breaker he had to watch . <P> Villanova 's unbeaten junior , Charley Jenkins , sprinted to a world 's indoor record for the 500-yd. run ( 56.4 sec . ) . <P> North Carolina College 's crack hurdler , Lee Calhoun , matched the indoor 60-yd. high-hurdle mark with 7.1 sec . <P> Bob Barksdale , Morgan State high jumper , cleared the bar at 6 ft. 9 in. to break a 22-year-old meet record .
