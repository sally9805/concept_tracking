India 's political wind is veering about . Recently the weathercocks have indicated that Nehru &; Co. , though they still proclaim their neutrality , are more &; more neutral on the side of the free world . <P> Last week Nehru 's government selected members of a " goodwill mission " to go to Red China next month , paying back the visit to India late last year of a Chinese " goodwill mission " ( whose calculated effect , Nehru now evidently perceives , was to stir India 's Communist Party into an impressive showing at the polls ) . Heading the list is Nehru 's sister , Madame Pandit , recently envoy to Washington , and before that envoy to Moscow ( where , though she arrived with a rosy view of the Russians , she became miffed because Stalin never received her ) . The Chinese Communists now regard her as so pro-American that , were she not Nehru 's sister , they would have vetoed her from the mission . <P> Also picked for the mission are A. N. Deva , head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen through Mao Tse-tung 's agrarian false whiskers ; Dr. Shanti Bhatnagar , who negotiated the recent U.S.-British oil-investment program in India ; and Leilamani Naidu , who guided the Red Chinese good-will mission around India and was thereafter the pet hate of China 's embassy . <P> The mission was carefully picked to give Nehru solid guidance on Red China-something his biased and gullible Peking ambassador , K. M. Panikkar , has failed to do . Panikkar 's stock with Nehru is reported to be low . It was n't helped any a fortnight ago when Panikkar 's daughter Devaki married one of India 's most prominent Communist bigwigs.
