Above Politics <P> Sir : <P> Even though a lifelong Republican with a yearning for a change in the present Federal Administration , I am disturbed over plans being laid by certain Republicans of brass-hat level to pressure General Eisenhower into giving up his present European responsibilities and accepting the Republican presidential nomination . The planners , in my opinion , could do no greater disservice to the country . <P> As a purely political move , it is granted that the nomination of the general would be a knockout . . . But General Eisenhower is now engaged in European work of tremendous importance to the safety of this and other non-Communist countries ... his weight is needed in Europe to facilitate the prevention , through preparedness , of a third World War which would have consequences too terrible to contemplate . . . No political aspirations on the part of others should take the general from his work . <P> Let 's keep Ike in Europe ! It would be interesting to know how other readers of TIME feel . <P> <P> RAYMOND H. SMITH Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir : <P> Most of the Republican Party and Republican press are making Democratic morality - or the lack of it-a major campaign issue . <P> Yet that party and that press are parties to a conspiracy of immorality . . . that makes the Democratic RFC shenanigans look like peanuts : I refer to the continued immorality that is McCarthyism . . . A Bipartisan Moral Policy is in order . HARRY MARGOLIS <P> The Bronx , N.Y . <P> <P> The Clever Chinese <P> Sir : <P> I accept the clich about the cleverness of the Chinese as fact , and I am prepared to believe a really ingenious forger capable of almost anything , but I simply do not credit your story TIME , Sept. 24 that " many of the money orders were small , and the amounts were often changed by clever forgers , e.g. , $1.37 to $1,379.44 . " Any such tidy kiting of U.S. Postal Money Orders is completely outside the realm of possibility , inasmuch as the absolute maximum value of each one is $100 . <P> <P> JASON LINDSEY Hollywood <P> Reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on U.S. Treasury checks. - ED . <P> <P> That Payton Person <P> Sir : <P> <P> A large bouquet to the writer responsible for " Manners &; Morals " TIME , Sept. 24 , and a faint slap on the wrist to TIME for lending importance to the matrimonial ( there is a better word ) tag matches that distinguish a certain layer of Hollywood society . Tone , Payton and Neal , like " That Gardner Girl , " might best be left to their petty problems . . . <P> <P> JOHN W. DOWNS JR . San Diego <P> Sir : <P> . . . Seldom have the frailties of human nature and the acceptance of alley-cat morality been more humorously chronicled . <P> <P> KERMIT HABER New York City Sir : <P> . . . The finest piece of tongue-in-cheek writing I 've seen in many a moon . <P> GEORGE B. Ross University City , Mo . <P> <P> Sir : . . . It 's exquisite ! <P> <P> LES BARNARD <P> Nashville <P> Sir : <P> <P> I appreciate the satire . . . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject in these days when there is so much to be written on subjects of real interest ? <P> <P> IRVING F.
