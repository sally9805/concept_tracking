Interior Secretary Fred Seaton , who got only tepid support from miners for his Domestic Mineral Stabilization Plan ( TIME , May 19 ) , last week won more enthusiasm with a new proposal for copper . The new one-year plan calls for Government stockpile purchases of up to 150,000 tons at prices up to 27 per lb. ( v. the present producers ' price of 25 per lb. ) in addition to the 10,000 tons a month the Government already buys for the stockpile . Western mining-state Congressmen like the stockpiling plan better than the out-and-out subsidy previously suggested , thus are expected to support the reciprocal trade agreements ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) instead of backing the recommendations of the Tariff Commission for tariff boosts which have already caused the U.S. trouble in South America . <P> The Seaton plan touched off a burst of speculation in the metal . Copper futures rose briefly ; custom smelters boosted their prices 1 to 26 per Ib. , and the free market price of copper on the London Metal Exchange rose to 25 per Ib. , highest since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks of refined copper are 253,463 tons , highest since World War II , traders figured that the stockpiling could cut down the surplus , pave the way for a rise from the 25-per-lb. price still maintained by primary producers . But copper miners pointed out that any real pickup would have to come from copper consumers , who have yet to increase their buying . Said Phelps Dodge 's President Robert G. Page : " There has been more buying in two or three days , but this in itself is not evidence of a pickup in consumer demand . More likely such buying is speculative . It is premature to predict a rise in producers ' prices . "
