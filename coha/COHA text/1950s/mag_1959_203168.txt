As the investigations widened and public suspicion grew , two arguments in defense of TV and allied entertainment fields , kicked up by volunteers and TV 's own flashy flacks , were heard again and again : 1 ) plugs , payola and all that jazz have been around for a long time ; 2 ) why pick on TV when other businesses are corrupt , too ? The case was typically put last week by Newscaster Jacques Legoff of Detroit 's WJBK-TV ( one of the five TV stations owned by the Storer Broadcasting Co . ) . Legoff , who had not reported the first quiz scandal stories until three days after they broke because he " thought it would all blow over , " angrily came to his industry 's defense . " What about the buyers in department stores , in grocery stores ? ' Buy one case of my product and you get one free . You buy my blue jeans and I 'll remember you at Christmastime . ' Is this not payola ? Have there not been accusations of this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions ? Payola in one form or another is a part of American business ... I say , ' Let him who is without sin cast the first stone . ' " <P> " Magazine Concept . " For having broken a station rule against editorializing , Newscaster Legoff was promptly fired . His dismissal was scarcely an adequate answer to his argument , but answers did come from all sides . No one maintained that TV or the pop music business had a monopoly on shady practices ; as the Christian Century pointed out , neither the press nor other media could afford to feel complacent . <P> But none of this altered what CBS President Frank Stanton described as the networks ' " laxness of responsibility " in an industry that is little controlled and vastly influential . " Something has to be done before it 's done to us , " said Stanton , hinting at a more balanced program schedule or even at programing that the industry , possibly in an unconscious tribute , calls the " magazine concept . " <P> " Deceptive Gloss . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . Said FCC Chairman John C. Doerfer : " A failure to distinguish between the freedom to express . . . ideas and the indiscriminate hawking of wares . . . has brought the advertising and broadcasting industries to the brink of strict Government controls . " <P> Reaching behind the widely used notion that all entertainment is built on artful deception , Doerfer warned that programs which " contain a deceptive gloss above the accepted tolerances of dramatic license " might be outlawed in the next session of Congress , since shows that lure viewers unethically are using unfair means to outdo the sponsor 's commercial competitors . " If the industry does not successfully survive that crisis , " concluded Chairman Doerfer , " it has no one to blame but itself . "
