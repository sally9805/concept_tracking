THE LIFE AND TIMES OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT , by Stefan Lorant ( 640 pp. ; Doubleday ; $15 ) , will seem as essential to admirers of Teddy Roosevelt as Lorant 's Lincoln is to worshipers of Honest Abe . The text is painstaking rather than incisive , but the 750 pictures have the cumulative effect of a cradle-to-grave biography that hardly requires words to give it significance . <P> THE SECOND WORLD WAR , by Winston S. Churchill and the Editors of LIFE ( 615 pp. , 2 vols. ; TIME Inc. ; regular edition , $25 ; deluxe edition , $27.50 ) , combines the best of Churchill 's sonorous prose from his six-volume history of World War II with some of the greatest war pictures and paintings ever brought between covers . The result , an excellent piece of bookmaking , anatomizes and dramatizes the greatest of wars . Included in the deluxe edition is an evocative recording of some of Churchill 's wartime speeches . <P> AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF Music , by Marc Pincherle ( 220 pp. ; Reynal ; $18 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history of Western music from early Christian chants to the present . Like any authoritative book that covers so vast a field , it seems perfunctory at times . But the basic information is there , and great taste has gone into the selection of 240 illustrations , ranging from a loth century B.C. harpist to Jazzman Sydney Bechet . <P> AFRICA , by Emil Schulthess ( Simon &; Schuster ; $20 ) , grew out of a trip to " Rocher Noir , " between Libya and French Equatorial Africa , to photograph an eclipse of the sun . Photographer Schulthess got his sun pictures , but he also took hundreds of others throughout Africa ( a desert woman nuzzling her child , a Masai herdsman and his flock ) , which together seem to say more about the Dark Continent than many prose books . <P> POPES THROUGH THE AGES , by Joseph Brasher , S.J. ( 530 pp. ; Van Nostrand ; $14.95 ) , brings together in a single volume pictures of 259 popes and accompanies each one with a brief biography . The effect is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church has again and again found the men and the means to defend the faith . <P> MARCEL DUCHAMP , by Robert Lebel ( 191 pp. ; Grove ; $15 ) , is billed as the " first full-scale study " of the Daddy of Dadaists . The scrappy text suggests that the author followed a method once used by Duchamp for writing music-he drew notes and musical markings out of a bag at random . But the volume makes up for the grab-bag text by reproducing almost every known work of Expressionist Cubist-Surrealist Duchamp , from his mustachioed Mona Lisa and famed Nude Descending a Staircase to the catalogue cover he decorated with a foam-rubber breast and the caption : " Please touch . " <P> <P> THE CIVIL WAR DICTIONARY , by Mark M. Boatner III ( 974 pp. ; Mckay ; $15 ) , suggests that arguments about the Civil War may never cease but that a lot of them are going to be settled by this book . Lieut . Colonel Boatner , onetime instructor of military history at West Point , has arranged 4,000 items in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War figures and scores of succinct action accounts from Gettysburg to mere skirmishes .
