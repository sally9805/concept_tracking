Since he became U.S. High Commissioner for Germany on July 1 , 1949 , John J. McCloy has heard a lot of griping and self-commiseration from the mouths of West Germans . By last week , he seemed to have had enough . <P> At a meeting in Dsseldorf of the French-German Friendship Society attended by more than 100 powerful Ruhr industrialists , McCloy predicted a bright future for the Ruhr and all Western Germany as part of a united Western Europe . But he added that the free world was watching to see whether Germany would continue on the right path . It was during the question period , following his calm , factual address , that trouble started . Led by Theodor Goldschmidt , president of Essen 's Chamber of Commerce , a group of Germans began firing complaints about high occupation costs , high taxes , the costly burden of refugees from the East , U.S. interference with German trade . <P> " Now wait a minute ! " cried Jack McCloy . " Things ca n't be as bad as you say when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blessings from your former enemies . . . U.S. taxes are higher than yours . " <P> From the businessmen came shouts of " nein , nein . " Replied McCloy sharply : " Well , anyway , U.S. taxes are much higher than before because of German aggression . " <P> To a complaint that reorganization of the West German coal and steel industries was going too slowly , McCloy answered : " Look , I know something about reorganization . I worked on reorganization of U.S. railroads . Your problems are no worse than those were . " On the refugee problem , he observed : " You ought to see the good side of it " - meaning the West Germans ought to be grateful for the skills and energy that refugees have added to the West German economy . <P> " Do n't forget who started this war , " concluded McCloy sternly . " Whether or not you gentlemen here are responsible personally for it , remember the war and all the misery that followed it-including your own-was born and bred in German soil and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , his audience applauded him loudly and with apparent sincerity . Said an admiring McCloy aide : " The old man really let ' em have it . "
