West Germany 's Bundestag last week passed a law that will give German labor unions a legal half nelson on German industry . The law takes West Germany farther from free-enterprising capitalism and closer to socialism-yet it was sponsored by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and his conservative coalition , which hoped thereby to prevent passage of a more drastic law . Mitbestimmungsrecht ( literally , the right of code termination ) is the word for Germany 's new halfway house to socialism . Extending to all German industry the rules that have bound the Ruhr 's steel mills and coal mines since 1947 , it requires employers to give their workers a substantial share in all decisions affecting their business . The bill 's provisions : In plants employing more than 500 workers , labor representatives will sit alongside management and stockholder representatives on the board of directors . Labor will cast one-third of the votes . In medium-sized businesses ( between 100 and 500 workers ) , workers ' committees must be kept informed of all policy decisions ( e.g. , profits , sales , financing ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a say in hiring &; firing . In small workshops ( less than 20 employees ) , watchdog labor councils will handle work contracts , employee welfare , grievances and training . <P> Codetermination will not apply to schools , churches and newspapers , where it might constrict freedom of thought . <P> Kurt Schumacher 's German Socialists held up passage of the bill for three days , while they held the floor for 25 hours in the longest filibuster in the short history of the new Bonn Republic . The bill , they complained , is " reactionary " because it gives the workers only one-third instead of one-half of the voting power in the larger industries . The German Federation of Trade Unions ( 6,000,000 members ) for the first time agreed to join with Schumacher 's party in fighting Adenauer.
