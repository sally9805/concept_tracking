day the new king had a discussion with his chancellor , one William de Longchamp . The latter , a small man with a crooked back , had seemed a curious choice to everyone in England for so high and honorable a post , although the wonder ceased when it became known that he had paid the king three thousand pounds for the office he held . He was proving himself an adept instrument in the raising of money by dishonest means . King Richard was sitting cross-legged in his chair , a list of names in his hand . He was a true Plantagenet , golden of hair , blue and handsome of eye , the possessor of a gladiator 's shoulders and chest , and of hands made to grasp all the fair wide provinces and the immense power his father had left him . " Gilles de Baudene , " said the young monarch , reading from the list . " I know a little of him . A contemptible fellow . A cur , a coward , and a skimp cheese . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for putting a fine on him . " The chancellor looked slyly at the king . " I think , sire , " he said , " we can make better use of this man than putting a sword into his hand . He is not a soldier but he is a claimant for the Baudene landholdings . " " Hah ! " said Richard . " That is different . " " He is a haggler over pennies but he wo n't hesitate to pay a large sum for a decision in his favor . I have discussed the point with him . How he wriggled , like a fox caught in a trap ! But he agreed to go to the moneylenders . " " Drive a hard bargain with him , Sir Chancellor . " When word came to the priory that the long-deferred decision about the Baudene land had at last been handed down , Edward the Saxon led his son out to sit on the tumbled stones of the gatehouse where no one could hear what was said . They presented a singular contrast now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight back and limbs and a fine spread of shoulder . Edward the Saxon , once so strong himself , had been aging rapidly . He had developed a condition which slowed his step and hollowed his cheeks . He seldom went out these days . His bow hung beside the chimney and the arrows rusted in the quiver . " My son , " he said , " we have lost ! " " Do you mean , " asked the boy , his face becoming very still and pale , " that the suit has been settled ? That it has gone against us ? " Edward the Saxon nodded . " The Norman gets everything . The in/formation which comes to me is that he paid so large a bribe that it will take him many years to clear his debt to the moneylenders . Still , he has won . The land is his . And all the honors . " Here his face flamed with sudden passion . " What else could we expect ? A Norman king , a Norman court , a Norman suitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The boy 's reactions to this bad news were curiously divided . Through his undivulged friendship with Alain of Casserlie , he had been gaining a sense of pride in the blood he had inherited from his beautiful Norman mother . The Normans , as Alain put it , were the rulers of the country , they were brave and chivalrous , and they went to the wars and won themselves much fame and glory . Why should n't he be proud that his mother had been Norman ? Why should he not look forward to the day when he himself might wear the gold spurs of knighthood ? Why should he not regard King Richard as the greatest of all warriors , a king for whom he should be glad to lay down his life ? But the fact of the decision was not easy to swallow . He got slowly to his feet and his eyes turned to the west where the sun was sinking under the tops of the trees which marked the boundary of the land still belonging to them . " Then , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all I shall ever have ? " His father rose also and placed a hand on his shoulder . " This , " he said , " and a heritage of pride which has always seemed to me more important than any possessions . There is , moreover , a trust . When the time comes , my son , I shall have something to tell you . Something that was told me by my father when he knew he was going to die . It may not be long now before I feel that the trust should be placed in your hands . " They walked slowly together across the untended sward . The last narrow rim of the sun vanished behind the cover of the trees and the air seemed of a sudden to become cold . The thin shoulders of Edward the Saxon drew together in a shudder . " You have a new friend , my son , " he said . Richard paused and gave a startled look at his father . " It is true , " he answered . " I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he were to appear now , I would feel as though the sun had changed its course and come up again over those trees . " " He is the son of the Butcher of Casserlie . " " How did you know ? "  | " Bits of information come to my ears . I have known of this for some time . " " Alain is brave and fine , and a true friend ! " cried the boy . " I sometimesthink we must be like David and Jonathan . " " My boy , it is good for you to have a friend of your own age and station . But it was not good that you did n't tell me . " They had reached the door and Edward opened it with a hand which trembled . " I suspect that I have little time left to enjoy your company and your confidence . I have no fault to find with you , my fine son , but perhaps a word of advice would not be amiss . Do not accept everything your friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood in his veins and his father holds land today which was stolen from your forefathers . Does the Butcher know of the friendship between you ? " " I think not , Father . " " Then this infamous decision may make no difference . Had Roger de Casserlie known , he would have judged you an unfit companion for his son . " There was a small fire burning on the hearth . Edward turned toward it eagerly . He sat down and hunched himself over the blaze . He had been losing his teeth and this had brought the tip of his nose close to what had once been the strong line of his jaw . " Now that our last hope has gone , " he said in a low tone , " there is little to live for . I think , Richard , that the time is close when I must transfer that trust to you . " Edward the Saxon slept little that night . He tossed and turned while his mind wrestled with the problems of the future ; not his own future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the poor prospects stretching ahead for his son . At dawn he heard old Godgifu , from behind the curtain which screened her from the rest , groaning and mumbling her prayers . He was aware of the heavy step of Sigurd on the uneven planking and the urgent tones of Tostig addressed to the reluctant Richard . Then he finally fell asleep and did not waken until the sun was high in the heavens and pouring through the narrow window beside his bed . Edward felt for once that he did not want to get up . What was there for him to do ? His heart was too weak for work in the fields . He was on the point of turning over to avoid the sunlight when hep103heard the thud and clatter of horses ' hoofs on the road . Alert again immediately , he sat up in bed and so could see that a party of perhaps half a dozen horsemen had arrived . A sleeve crossed his line of vision . It was black with bars of green . The livery of Pembroke ! The owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " William the Marshal is paying me a visit ! " he said to himself . " It must be that he has had my letter . Perhaps he has come to say he can take the boy into his household as I requested . If that is it , I shall be able to die with an easy mind . " William the Marshal was so long of back and leg that he needed a tall steed and in consequence the lady beside him , on a black palfrey with silver gear and bright plumes in its mane , looked very small indeed . William had a fondness for feeling the wind on his face and through his hair , and so he was riding bareheaded . He was in his fifties but his bold features showed no signs of age ; a handsome man with fine gray eyes in which no trace of guile or malice could be found . The lady with him was his new-made wife , Isabella , the daughter of Strongbow ( who had led the conquering Normans into Ireland ) and the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue of eye , and very much in love with her husband , to judge by the many occasionsshe found to touch his gauntleted hand or lean her head against his arm . " Edward ! " cried the marshal when the Saxon appeared at the gate . " It is many years since I have seen you . Not indeed since we returned together from the Crusades . But , old friend , I have thought many times of the well-directed lance you brought to my aid on a certain occasion when the paynims were pressing me hard . " He came to a sudden stop , having had a chance by this time to notice the change in his friend 's appearance . " Edward , are you ill ? You are no longer the bold blade who set out for the Holy Land with me . " " That was a very long time ago , Sir Marshal , " declared Edward , " and in the meanwhile the years have been taking toll of me . But not of you , my lord ! You seem as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , " said the old warrior . " When a man waits to my age before taking a wife and is rewarded then with the hand of the loveliest lady in Christendom  --  well , he does not relish looking as old as I  --  as I really am . " " My sweet lord , " said the bride , " I am happy you waited so long . Otherwise I would not have you now and some hussy would . " The marshal looked down at her , and quite a distance it was he hadp104to look , and smiled with so much warmth and affection that Edward , watching , lost for a moment his recollections of William as a great fightingman , as a steel-clad scourge in the lists , as the knight who had never been worsted . " But , my small bride , " said the marshal , " there is no denying that I am an old man and you are a mere girl . You are so very young ! You should have been given a chance to choose for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . As she did so Edward noticed that along the bridge of her very shapely nose ( perhaps because of the outdoor life she had lived on her huge Irish estates ) there ran a barely discernible line of small freckles . " My sweet , my very sweet lord and master , " said the bride , " you give me too small credit . Do you think I had no say in selecting you from the others ? From all those others who were willing to have me  --  and my lands and honors ? I went to some pains to see you and then I demanded a word with my liege lord the king  --  the old king , it was  --  and I said to him , I shall wed the marshal and none other . ' He looked at me like a thundercloud because he had other ideas . He did n't want to give me to you because you had not offered to pay him anything at all , so little did you desire me --  " " Come , sweet chuck , " declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have given him everything I possessed  --  and that would still have been next to nothing . " " Well , " continued the small and sprightly wife , " I made it very clear to Harry Secund  --  and later to King Richard as well  --  that it was you or no one . Even though some of the others had offered huge sums , I was going to be the wife of the marshal of England or I would remain unwed to the end of my days . And now you know the whole story . " The marshal turned to Edward , who had been trying to convince himself that he could offer them wine , the best in the house being of very poor quality . " We are riding through to Pembroke , where we hope to have a brief rest . And I thought we must not pass so close without halting a brief moment to see an old comrade in arms . " He paused and gave Edward a solicitous glance . " I heard of the decision . A foul injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This son of yours seems to be in much the same position that I was once . I had no prospects whatever and so I went to Normandy to serve an uncle . It would be a sound idea , indeed , ' I said to myself , for my stout old friend 's son to come into my household  --  as a page , then a squire , and finally a belted knight to ride in my train . ' He would have the same chance then thatp105I had , to feather his nest with tournament prizes and perchance to pick up a little bit of land here and there . " " " Sir Marshal , I can think of no better future for my poor , dispossessed son ! " cried Edward , his spirits rising so high that a touch of the old fire showed in his eyes . The lady asked a question at this point . " Sir Edward , could I see the young man ? It is necessary first , I believe , that I should like him and that he should like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living with us and having much to do with the many children we expect to have ; and so we must all be sure . " Edward turned back to the threshold where a trumpet , made from a ram 's horn , was hanging . He placed this to his lips and sounded a loud blast . Almost immediately a boy 's voice answered from the thin cover of woods in the west . The master of Rawen then blew three times in rapid succession . " That is a signal to come at once , " he explained to the visitors . " As my lands are small , it will take him no more than a few minutes to get here . " When Richard arrived in a breathless state a very few moments later , with Tostig running at his heels , the marshal took no more than one look at him before saying : " My boy , you have a fine long leg and a good back . I am disposed to think you will grow up to be as tall as I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be an easy one to jolt from your seat . Let me test your muscles . Ah , splendid ! They are long and will never gather up into tight little knots on your arms and legs . " He nodded to Edward . " I like your son , my old friend . He has a good eye . Gentle he will be unless aroused and then he will be like a roaring lion in his wrath . At least , that is what I read in him at this one quick glance . " The Countess of Pembroke then commanded the boy 's attention . She leaned over to take both his hands in hers . " Richard , " she asked , " would you like to come with us and serve us , first , as a page ? Later , of course , my lord would assert himself and take you away to learn the arts and tricks of war . " Richard 's eyes lighted up as though he had been shown all the kingdoms of the earth . " Oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be a true knight is my only wish . I will serve you faithfully and well , my lady . " The countess continued to study his face . " Yes , it is true , you have a good eye . And I like the way your hair grows down on your forehead . It is my opinion that you will grow into a handsome knight . " SheP106glanced then at Edward the Saxon with a hint of sympathy for him in her eyes . " Sir Edward , " she said , " I am very much afraid that we are going to rob you of your son . " After it had been arranged that Richard should join the marshal 's household on their return from Pembroke Castle to Cavenham , the home which was their favorite among the scores of places they owned , and that Tostig was to go too ( for the discerning eye of the young wife had seen how close the friendship was between the pair ) , the marshal turned his horse to leave and his lady gave them a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gloved hands and following after him . Edward said to the boys , " Come with me , " and led the way back into the cluster of ruined walls behind them . In the stype there remained a stone bench large enough to seat three . " You must not think , Richard , that being a page  --  or filling whatever post they find for you , Tostig  --  is going to be easy , " he began . They seemed somewhat surprised at this and he went on to explain . " A page is a household servant , in everything but name . At first he 's supposed to pay special attention to the lady of the house . He stands behind her chair at meals and he must not only serve her but anticipate her needs . Before she can say , Bring the hot-water ewer , ' her page should be at her shoulder , tilting the handle so she can dip her hands in . " You will discover a custom when you get out into the world which sets all men into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellar about halfway of the board . Above it sit the family , the high officers of the household , and prominent guests . Below the salt are the squires , the house servants , the field churls , the dusty travelers of low degree ; and you , Tostig , will be among them . As for you , Richard , you will not have a seat at meals . You will remain in attendance at the head of the board until everyone has been served , even the least-considered varlet at the foot of the table . You will get for yourself then whatever is left , and it may be no more than a crust of bread or a well-gnawed bone . " You wo n't go to bed until your master and mistress are couched for the night and then you will probably curl up on a skin outside their door so you will be wakened at dawn by the first servant to appear . " When a page becomes old enough to be a squire , " he went on , " he is allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a lance . Now things are different but even harder . He polishes armor and burnishes swords and he is always very busy with the horses . In battle he fights behind his master , going to his assistance when necessary andp107procuring a new horse if his master 's is killed . After the fighting , while the knights feast and drink and then snore the night away , the patient squire is still repairing the ravages to armor and garments and getting ready for another day of rampage and fury . If he survives all this , he becomes in time a knight himself and carries a banneret on his lance and has squires of his own . " Richard gave his head an ecstatic shake . " A wondrous life ! " he said . " What more could a man ask than to serve ? For it is clear that , while the squire serves the knight , the knight serves the earl , the earl serves the king and the king serves his God . I shall be happy to begin a bumble life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be lucky indeed , my son , that it is William the Marshal you are to serve . He was a landless wight , just as you are , and so he had to make a place for himself with his strength and his skill with weapons . Have I ever told you that he fought in five hundred tournaments and won them all ? No knight has there ever been to compare with William , and yet he is always kind , with a smile for the beggar by the wayside as well as for the courtiers about the king . He has been a slave to duty . When he sees his way clearly before him , nothing can change or swerve him . He was always the most loyal to the old king when the princes began to rebel against their father . Once , very near the end , old Harry Secund was forced to retire because the French king and Prince Richard were out in great force against him . He was retreating from Le Mans and young Prince Richard rode hard after him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered . He was holding the rear guard in hand with great skill and courage . God 's feet , Marshall ' cried the prince . Do not slay me ! " The Devil slay you , for I will not ! ' answered the marshal , unhorsing the prince by killing his mount . " Edward paused before adding : " I know of nothing more to the credit of Richard than this , that on becoming king he held no grudge against the marshal but continued him in his post and put no obstacles in the way of his marriage to the heiress of Pembroke . " " What will I need to take with me ? " asked the boy in an anxious voice . " You will be expected to go to him suitably clothed , " was the answer . " It is customary to have a woolen tunic , two pairs of hose , without a patch on them , a dagged cloak of scarlet wool with enameled buttons , a leather belt , and two pairs of good shoes . You will ride your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young animal of good spirit . " There was a moment of silence . " 1t will cost you much to send me to the great earl 's castle . " " Yes , my son . It will be a difficult matter . But somehow , " with an involuntary sigh , " it will be accomplished . A ring that your lady mother gave me will have to be sacrificed , I fear . " " It has always been this way , " added Edward after a pause . " When there has been need of something for you , my son , we have fallen back on what your lady mother provided . You get your looks from her . Your sense of high lineage . Your high pride ; although perhaps I share in that , never having been of a humble turn . The few objects of value which adorn this poor habitation carne from her . And now , with a gift from the past , she gives you the chance to go suitably clothed into the years of preparation for knighthood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such pride in the Norman blood in your veins , knowing that it comes from that gracious and lovely lady . It is to be expected that you  --  that you take more pride in it than in the Saxon share . " The boy said nothing for a moment . He had listened to his father 's low voice with a sudden sense of shame . He was realizing for the first time that , without desiring to do so , he had shown little regard but rather contempt for the Saxon tradition , for that half of himself . Suddenlyhis shoulders began to shake and tears streamed down his cheeks . " My father , I have been blind , " he said . " I have been unfair . It is n't true that I think only of my mother and never of you . But  --  but I never saw her and she is in my mind so much of the time . " " Richard , Richard , I am not blaming you ! It is natural for you to feel as you do , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glories of the Saxon line from which you spring . "  |p109When  all the preparations for the departure had been made , and the new tunic and the dagged cloak of scarlet wool ( this term applied to the material , which was quite special and would wear for generations , and did not mean that the color was scarlet ; it was more often brown or green ) and the horse of spirit had been obtained , Richard rode out to meet his friend Alain of Casserlie and say farewell . Alain arrived at the meeting place a little late but his eyes were shining . " I have news , " he called . " And I also , " answered Richard . " Great , glorious news ! " " I 'll tell mine first , " said Alain , which was typical of him . " What do you think of this , Rick-with-the-Frown ? I am to be wed . Oh , not at once . The articles have been agreed to but it will be a few years before we have the churching . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Richard looked soberly at his friend . " When that happens , it will be an end to everything between us , Alain , " he declared . " You will forget me when you leave the chapel with a wife on your arm . " " You groutnoll ! Romance means nothing in my life . I grant you that the small Adela is a sweet chick --  " " So it 's that one . " " You have seen her ? Then I do n't need to tell you that her hair 's a wonderful red and that she 's as pretty as a kitten . But when she rode away with her parents , I was glad to see the last of her . Oh , when it comes to wedding , I suppose I 'll get as soft and moon-struck as anyone but that 's years and years away . In the meanwhile I have my spurs to win . " Well , " said Richard after a pause , " now for mine . I 'm going away . To be a page in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been changing . Once a fine and high tenor , it had now taken to breaking up and down the scale in the most unpredictable ways . It was almost with a screech that he responded to this piece of information . " Richard ! " he cried . " My good old Rick , my Dick , my Dickon , my very best friend ! What everlasting luck ! " " My father went to the Crusades with the marshal , " explained Richard , his eyes shining with the enthusiasm which filled them . " Yes , it 's a wonderful chance . It makes up for everything bad that 's happened to me , even the loss of Baudene . " Alain leaned over in his saddle and placed his hands on Richard 's shoulders . " Best of friends , I wish you joy of your great good fortune but I ca n't help being jealous . Rick-with-the-Frown , I would change places with you this very minute . I would sell you my birthright for the chance , and throw in everything I 'll ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands which will come to me with my Adela . Nay , I would throw in the little redheaded Adela herself and still count myself the winner in the deal ! " The night before Richard and his companion were to leave , Edward the Saxon leaned over and touched his son 's forearm during the evening meal . " Tonight , " he confided in a whisper , " I shall place in your hands the trust that has been mine since the death of my father . You see , my son , I have no illusions . I do not expect to see you again . " Richard looked at the thin , lined face of the prematurely aged man and a sense of fear gripped his heart . " I will be allowed to return , " he protested . " There will be times when I am not needed and then I shall ride back to see you . If this were not so , I would change all the plans and not go with the marshal at all . " Edward shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be better for you to put this life far back in your memory and think only of the future . Nothing must stand between you and the winning of your spurs . It may be that the Lord and His blessed Son will be kind and grant me a longer time to live , in which case I might hope to see you come riding down the old road on a tall black horse under a curling banner and the gold glittering at your heels . But I am not asking such a boon . There is a hand which beckons me to the life beyond . I speak the full truth , Richard , when I say that I will welcome the chance to  --  to wear the cross a second time . " There was a long moment of silence betweenp111them . " And so tonight you must hear the story and see  --  what there is to see . " When that harsh but just man , Henry , the youngest son of William the Conqueror , came to the throne of England ( said Edward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not only because Henry had made vows at his coronation to rule well and to have regard for the rights of all men , even the lowliest , but because this also was known of him : he had seen the fair Saxon princess Matilda , the great-granddaughter of Edmund Ironside , and wanted her for his wife . There was some doubt about the rightness of this , because the princess had been living in a convent under the stem rule of an aunt . Had she taken the vows of heaven ? The princess said no , she had made no pledges , and in this she was upheld by the court that the good Archbishop Anselm held at Lambeth . And so , in due course , she rode beside the new king to Westminster , her eyes filled with happiness , her flaxen hair glistening like gold under its rich woven net , and was crowned queen of England . She was a good woman and a good queen and , had she lived longer , things might have been much different in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years as queen she felt the hand of death reaching for her shoulder , and she performed a brave and farseeing act before her death which made it possible to preserve for all time the benefits of the king 's earlier intentions . And this ( continued Edward the Saxon ) leads us to a story of some strangeness . On a stormy spring night in the year 1118 , Cuthbert of Rawen was sitting longer than usual over his wine . Cuthbert was a man of strong character and it irked him more than it had his father and grandfather before him that the great domain of the family had been taken from him . The small house which stood against the walls of Rawen was like a prison cell to this bold and ambitious man . He had faith in his destiny and he believed he would march in the van when a certain long-awaited signal came . As he sat and glowered unhappily at the dying fire on the hearth there came a knock on the gate in the barricade of stakes which then stood high and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . No ordinary visitor would come knocking at his door when the night was as far advanced as this . Cuthbert knew a moment almost of fear . The Devil was said to come to men 's gates in the dead of night and knock loudly.  |p112He  heard the cautious voice of his servant raised in a note of interrogation . In a matter of seconds the door in the oaken screen swung open and an old man came in . Old age does either one of two things to men : it shrinks them into useless , wrinkled husks or it intensifies the qualities which have been in them from the beginning . The visitor was very old but he stood in the door and looked at Cuthbert with eyes which had lost none of their fire . His almost fleshless hands were clasped over the end of a staff and in the bend of his back there was no hint whatever of surrender to time . " My son , " he said , " I come at a late hour . It was necessary . " Cuthbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holy man to receive his blessing and to ask a question which tingled on his tongue and sent waves of excitement racing through his body . " Father Ached ! " he whispered tensely . " Has it happened ? Does this mean that the bell is rungen ? " The old priest answered in an equally low tone , although they had the room completely to themselves . " No , my son . The time is not yet . The bell will not ring until we are ready . " " I am ready . Are not all other men equally so ? " " It is not a question of what is in men 's hearts , my son . Our oppressors are still too strong . We must have more men , more weapons , more money . " Cuthbert got to his feet and for several moments the blazing black eyes of the old priest stared hard into those of the Saxon thane , which were bold and of a steely blue . They had ceased to be priest and layman . They were members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only . " I wo n't hear the bell , my son , " said Father Aelred , after several momentshad passed . " My days are numbered . The leader will not come in my time . But you should live to hear it , and to follow the leader , whoever he may be . " " God grant it , Father Aelred ! " The voice of the thane was deep and fervent . " God grant me this boon , to live long enough to draw my sword and stain it deep with Norman blood on that day of days ! " The venerable priest made his way to a bench before the fire and sat down . He brushed away Cuthbert 's offer of wine . " My son , I am the bearer of bad news , " he said . " The queen has not long to live . " When Cuthbert joined him at the fire , seating himself on a log of wood , the old priest amplified his statement . " She has been ill for a longp113time . The king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappybecause of this but her greatest regret is that she sees in him a tendency to forget the promises he made . " Father Aelred studied the pattern of the slow flames . " I have been with her now for many years and she has often sought my advice . Often she has followed it . " ( Often , indeed ! It was known everywhere that it had been his wise counsels which guided her . ) " You know , of course , that after his coronation vows the king prepared one hundred copies of the promises he made and sent them out to all parts of the kingdom . He was a zealous young king then , and his bride was at his side to whisper sound advice in his ear ; and so he wanted it known to all men that he intended to be a just ruler . He regrets this now , having no further wish to be bound by the generous impulses of his youth . It is in the queen 's mind that , as soon as she is gone , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charter and to destroy them . She has asked me to act to this end , that one copy at least will be placed beyond his reach . This , my son , is the errand which brings me here , like a thief in the night . " The priest fumbled in a leather bag under his girdle and produced a gold ring which he handed to the thane . " The pledge of our good queen . So you may know that I come at her command and that you may put full trust in me . " It was a plain gold band , with the royal initials and insignia stamped on the inside . The master of Rawen studied it with a reverent eye while the priest went on to explain his mission . " I have brought a copy of the Charter with me . Unbeknown to the king , she has always kept this one in her own possession . It is her wish now that it be placed in other hands . I mentioned you to her and she agreed that a better custodian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and it must be so well hidden away that no one , except you and I , may know where it is . " Father Aelred drew then from a capacious pocket on the inside of his robe a plain wooden container which he placed in the hands of the thane . " It is short , " he said . " But it contains the wisest precepts ever laid down for the guidance of a king . It may well serve as a covenant to be exacted of all future icings . You must guard it with your life , if necessary , Cuthbert of Rawen . You are to surrender it only if someone comes to demand it who bears a replica of this ring . Give me your promise to be true to this trust which has been placed in you . " " I swear , " said Cuthbert solemnly , " to guard the Charter with myP114Iife and to reveal the secret of its existence to no one , as long as there is breath in my body ; save if it should be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand the secret on to my eldest son . " " Your willingness to become the custodian of this paper has lifted a weight from my heart . I know that it is in the best of hands . " The priest studied the travel-stained condition of his sandals with a weary eye but rose nevertheless to his feet . " So that no word may be noised abroad of my having been here tonight , I think it wise to ride on to St. Wulstan 's . " He allowed his voice to fall to a whisper . " Do not despair , Cuthbert of Rawen , the bell will be rungen in God 's own good time . Our fathers thought it would be Hereward when he sent out the war arrow and resisted the Conqueror so long on the Isle of Ely but the people of England were too badly beaten down to respond . There will be another Hereward or a brave Harold to rise up and lead you . It must be seen to that the English king who rules after the ringing of the bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave with you . " Such was the story that Edward the Saxon told his son on the eve of the boy 's departure . When he came to the end , noting with satisfaction the rapt interest with which the boy had listened , he added : " No messengerhas come since with the other ring and , of course , the bell has not been rung . The masters of Rawen have continued to save whatever they could for the day when the bell will ring and money will be needed . The contributions have been smaller as the years passed . I have been able to add no more than a few pennies . " " And the Charter is still here ? " asked the boy . " In this house ? " " It is still here . " " Your father told this story to you ? " " On his deathbed , Richard . I am the fourth to be told the story and to learn of the place where the Charter is hidden . You , my son , the fifth , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I swear , " said the boy eagerly . The small household had scattered while father and son talked at the head of the table . Sigurd had already made his way up to his straw palletabove and no doubt was sound asleep . Dirk had disappeared . Old Godgifu was in the kitchen and they could hear her muttering to herself over her tasks . Only Tostig remained and he had betaken himself to the far end of the table . The torches placed at the head and foot of the table had burned down low and the drafts threatened momentarily to extinguishthem.  |p115Edward  the Saxon rose to his feet . " And now , " he said , " it remains to show you the place where the Charter has been kept . I think , " he added after a moment 's hesitation , " that we must make some use of Tostig . He will accompany us , for part of the way , at least . " 3Father and son walked out through the broken palisade , Tostig followingwith a mattock over his shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnished moon was yielding so much light that they could see all the way through the broken-backed arches of the cloisters to the clumps of stone marking the line of the western wall . " It was on just such a night that my father led me out for this same purpose , " he said as though to himself . " It seemed to me that every bird flying on wings had come to attend us . They rustled in the ivy and twittered among themselves and the owls were hooting . I thought they were saying , These poor mortals , stealing out at dead of night on their silly little errands . ' My father was so weak that he clung to my arm and he could barely whisper . He died before morning . " A sudden and angry fluttering of wings greeted them at the entrance to the refectory . A single owl hooted from above the abbot 's house where , no doubt , Dirk was already fast asleep . " Nothing seems to have changed , " muttered Edward . " The vines should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tostig . " Give them time and they 'll have all the walls down . " The refectory , being so securely roofed , was very dark inside . Tostig laid down his mattock and lighted a torch . " It is well that the roof holds , " said Edward . " Once it comes down , these stones underfoot will yawn and give up what is beneath . " He began , still making use of the boy 's arm , to pace off distances from two of the walls . When convinced of his correctness , he tapped on one of the large square stones with his foot . " This one , Tostig , " he said . " It is to come up . Put your back into it , my lad . " The sturdy youth had the stone up quickly and , for a moment , the three of them stood together and looked into a dark vault below . The light of the torch made it possible to see the outline of a brief flight of stone steps leading downward . Edward took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone in the vault below which had a cross chiseled on itsp116surface . Edward pointed to the one above . This yielded easily to Richard'spick and it was found to be of a few inches in thickness only . There was a dark space behind it , from which the questing hand of the father drew out the wooden case containing the Charter . He stood and looked at it in silence , his fingers trembling with excitement . " As you know , my son , " he said , " I can not read . And yet I am certain of this , that there is no document in the world today , saving those of divineorigin , which is of importance equal to this . It contains the hint of something new . An idea , a belief ! That all men  --  even those who work in the fields and follow their overlords into battle  --  have the right to think as they please , to speak their own minds , to live as they desire , to be punished for misdoings only by due process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper in its container , as though afraid to let the light touch it . " Your head is full of dreams , my son , and it may be that this idea does not stir your heart yet as it does mine . But someday , I am sure , your eyes will open to the light . " The next article removed from the open space was a bag of coins . Edward 's inability to read did not detract from his capacity to figure . He proceeded to count the coins on the damp floor of the vault . " Eleven hundred and fifty-six , " he said . " You must never forget , my son , the purpose for which these coins were accumulated and hidden away . The total has grown little since Cuthbert of Rawen died , the difficultiesof mere existence having become so great . It was started soon after the calamity of conquest befell us , at a time when every man of Saxon blood was certain we would soon be able to rally and drive the invaders out . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea how tenacious and greedy were the fingers of the invadersin their mailed gloves . They saw the strong , high castles being built at all strategic points but did not sense how difficult this would make any effort at liberation . The truth of the matter was that our peopleneeded a great leader . The leader will come , never fear ; and so we must keep this humble contribution of our ancestor 's storing . Every penny , as well as every man , will be needed , Richard , when the bell finally rings . I charge you not to take a single piece from this small hoard for any other purpose . " " You have my promise , " declared the boy . When they had climbed the steps and replaced the stone which concealedthem , Edward the Saxon produced another document . " This , " he said , handing it to Tostig , " makes you a free man . It has been legallyp117drawn and properly attested and from this moment you are no longer bound to the land . Your life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children you bring into the world will be as free as you are . " Tostig 's strong hand trembled as he accepted the document . " Is it mine ? " he asked . " Am I to keep it ? " " It is yours . And you have earned it fairly and well . " The weary eyes of the head of the household took on a degree of warmth as he studied the sturdy figure in the plain gray tunic , and the close-cropped head . " My hope , Tostig , is that you will continue to serve my son . " " I ask nothing better , master . " " You have a sound head on your shoulders . And a sense of caution which , I fear , my son lacks . He will need you , Tostig , in the years ahead . " Edward paused and then held out a hand to the newly freed man . " And remember this . From now on you call no one master . " " The next morning , as the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two adventurers took to their horses . The saddle cloths were of the plainest gray material , the snaffle bits were of unadorned iron , the stirrupslacked any hint of inlay , the saddlebags were of woolen cloth without any armorial embroidery . The travelers looked exactly what they were  --  a poor young lad and his servant , starting out on a journey . When they reached the point where the road forked and one arm went to Baudene , they took for the first time the other arm which would lead them to London town.  |p118RICHARD  OF RAwEN sat his favorite horse Messire on the edgeof the tilting grounds at Savran-Dupre , one of the residences inNormandy of the marshal and his highborn wife . It was a busy scene , for all the squires were out , nearly a score of them , and as many of the pages as could escape from domestic duties . The boys were practicingat the quintain , a fixed target with a knight 's shield , at which they could ride and sharpen their aim . The squires were pounding away at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master of all he surveyed . Having won his spurs on the march to the relief of Arras , and having , moreover , entered many tournamentsand won them all , he was second only to the old marshal himself in the eyes of the younger men of the household . They had fallen into the habit of seeking his advice , and they marveled at the length and strength of his limbs as well as the extent of his worldly wisdom . Guy de Coutrand came over to join him , riding a gray horse with a fine mane . " Shall we splinter a lance , Sir Richard ? " he asked . The new knight looked first at his friend 's mount and then quietly smoothed the black mane of Messire . " Gladly would I measure skill with you , my good friend Guy , " he said , " but my old fellow here would refuse . " " The horse ? " cried the young Norman . " The horse . You see , that is a good steady war horse you are riding  --  Amadis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proper charger , trained in the ways of the tilting grounds . Messire knows this as well as we do . He would not move from his station . " " God 's chin ! " cried the Norman . " I 've heard it said that horses sometimesget such notions . But I 've never believed it . " " You were not here the last time it happened , " said Richard . " I wasp119against Bertrand of Belsize . He was riding a fast , skittish roan . The trumpet sounded , the roan got into full stride , the spectators roared . Messire did not stir an inch . I cried to him , At them , Messire ! Our honor is at stake ! ' He did not move , except to toss his head scornfully . Bertrand reined in his mount and glared at me . What is this ? ' he demanded . You seem to be amused . " Yes , I am amused , ' I said . At this foolish fellow of mine . ' " " But I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let me explain . Let me tell you what is going through his mind . He is saying to himself , Why should I ride against this great looby of a horse who might swing out of Iine or tumble in a heap and throw his rider off balance ? I might get his lance in my eye instead of it striking the shield of my master . Besides , ' he is thinking , there is the matter of my rights and my dignity to be considered . I should not be asked to ride against colts or green loobies , I am Messire and I am a champion . The other horse , the gray , seemed to understand the situation . He was standing quietly by , with his head down . He knew his own shortcomingsand that he was unfit to ride against the lordly black . " Ma foil " cried the Norman . " Never have I given ear to such folly ! " " Demand of the grooms a trained charger , Guy de Coutrand , and Messire and I will gladly run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pembroke lion on the green of his sleeve came at a brisk run from the direction of the castle . He bobbed his head at Richardand delivered a message . He , Sir Richard , was wanted . By his lordship , the marshal . At once , as it was a matter of importance . The mood of the black charger had changed . He rubbed his long nose along his master 's sleeve . " My good fellow , my find old rampager ! " said the young knight . He turned to Tostig , that stern disciplinarian . " I detect a gleam in your eye as though you think something should be done about this . If you please , Tostig , we will not be hard on Messire this time . Instead I would suggest "  --  hegave the squire the benefit of a broad grin  --  " a measure of oats . " " No disciplining then , " assented Tostig . " But , " in high dudgeon , " no oats ! " The marshal of England was seated in a corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact rather small and dingy . The bench he had chosen was lacking in the necessary strength for his great weight and was creaking a little . A back door had been left open andP120several dogs and a huge hog had come in and were rooting about among the rushes on the floor on a quest for food . " I would not have asked you to see me here but there is no privacy anywhere in this place , " said the marshal . He looked at the animal intruderswith distaste . " It was a mistake to come here , Rick . It 's one of my few personal properties and I 'm not at all proud of it . But that lovely little wife of mine has an insatiable curiosity . She 's determined to visit all the places we own if it kills both of us . I do n't think we 'll stay here long . Last night she was looking at everything in a very thoughtful way , it seemed to me . We 'll be off for somewhere else in the winking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revealing light of day that the marshal was beginning to show his years . There were fine lines and wrinkles about his eyes and mouth and a general air of weariness . The marshal sighed and proceeded to explain his reason for summoningthe young knight . " My boy , I am sending you on an errand of great delicacy , nay , of secrecy . You must leave at once . For Brittany . " " Yes , my lord , " assented Richard eagerly . He would be glad also to get away from Savran-Dupre . The night before he had slept under the table with a round dozen other bachelors and he still ached from the roughness of his couch . The marshal frowned as though uncertain how to explain the mission . These were parlous days , with John not yet firmly established on the throne of England and fiercely suspicious of everyone . The new king was well aware that young Prince Arthur of Brittany had a better claim to the throne and that most of his subjects thought so . " I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally . " A whisper has reached my ears that our bold and not too well-advised prince is contemplating a step which "  --  there was a pause  --  " which will have dire consequences . For him . My message must be no more than whispered in his ear , after exacting a promise that it will go no further . You are to inform him that  --  well , that the step he contemplates , which is neither right nor politic in the first place , has ceased to be a secret . It may seem strange to you that I am willing to make him aware that I have this knowledge . I can not see that unfortunate prince walk blithely into a trap . In any case I feel it is better for the peace to be kept . " Richard could not help wondering how much consideration the young prince would be likely to give to advice coming from William the Marshal . Had not the old soldier been chiefly responsible for pro/claiming John the king of England on the night when word had been received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a whim that induced William to take his young squire with him when he rode to Rouen on that fateful night . It had been just as well that he did , for the Countess Isabella had whispered in Richard 's ear that she would depend on him to see that her husband and lord wore a surcoat over his armor and a covering of some kind on his bead , and that he should break the long ride for a rest . He was the only one in the train she could trust with these instructions . Actually , she had added , it was not Richard himself she trusted so much , it was his squire Tostig , who had made a reputation for himself in the householdas a man of much good sense . Between them , Richard and Tostig , they had seen to it that the marshal did not overly tire himself on the ride over the rain-swept roads to Rouen . They arrived in that ancient city a full hour after sundown and made their way to the Abbey of Saint-Ouen , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the warmth of his furlinedsurcoat and the woolen bascinet under his helmet , the marshal had begun to show signs of fatigue . Richard advised hint to go at once to bed and take up his duties in the morning . " Not so , " said the marshal , looking down at his young knight with a critical frown ( he stood two full inches above the tall Richard ) . " There are matters of state to be settled before there can be any thought of slumber . We must go at once to the archbishop 's palace . " " My lord , " protested Richard , " you have ridden all day . And you are the custodian of Rouen . Why should n't the archbishop come to yourThe marshal did not seem to hear . He was rubbing his unshaved chin and frowning thoughtfully . " The streets were crowded when we rode through . I know the reason . The place is filled with mercenaries , it is stuffed with them to the very eaves . I do n't understand but this is alwayshappening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air and these beasts of prey collect . They seem to come out of nowhere  --  from the Low Countries , from Burgundy , from Italy , from every corner of the Teuton countries . Great hulking brutes , all of them , wild boars in human guise . " He turned to Richard . " Death lurks in the streets tonight . We must go in full force to the palace . "  |p122The  rain had stopped when they ventured out but this , they realized at once , was not to be considered a turn for the better : the birds of prey might have stayed within and steamed in their damp clothing before inn fires if the moisture had continued to descend but as it was they were in the streets , looking for throats to cut and purses to filch . Tostig strode in the lead , holding a lantern with horn slides above his head , a furtive porter at his shoulder to point out the way . A dozen knights followed , then the old marshal with head sunk forward in deep absorption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They traversed the Rue de la Grosse Horloge , the main artery of the old town , and found it advisable to walk in the center and to huddle closely together . Heads peered at them from doorways and voices muttered in alleys but no one ventured to dispute the passage of so strong a body ; and in due course , with a bitter wind whipping their surcoats about them and the clouds above in wild confusion , they came to the gloomy stone building in the open square of the cathedral , where Walter de Coutances had his abode . The archbishop 's palace was a damp and sour old rookery . There must have been leaks in the roof , for streams of water were running down the walls and all the furnishings were mildewed and malodorous . The old churchman fitted into this picture perfectly . He had been in his bed and his scant gray hair formed a comic fringe to the tonsured baldnessof his pate . A bed covering of some kind was wrapped about his shoulders and his feet were so affected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was drafty and the candles guttered and went out and had to be relighted continually by shivering attendants . " Ha , Marshal ! " said the archbishop . " A sad matter , this . The archer who loosed the bolt has been skinned alive but that wo n't bring our great King Richard back . " The marshal nodded grimly . Perhaps because he wanted an intelligentwitness he had brought Richard with him into the long cold room with its gaping black hearth , leaving the rest of his train in the regions below where warm fires blazed . " My lord bishop , I have an order with the king 's own hand to it , that I am to take charge here . There is some recruiting to be done  --  which will be an easy matter  --  and the peace to be kept , and the royal findal to be guarded . " " Little enough of that , my good friend . " The bishop snuffled scornfully . " He kept drawing on it and I question if you 'll find much left.  |p123He  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , to make it fly in all directions . " There was a moment of silence and then the marshal sighed heavily . " All such things are as nothing . It is for us , you and me , my lord bishop  --  yea , you and me and none else  --  to decide who will be proclaimed here in Rouen . John or Arthur ? Have you a stout stomach for the making of such a decision as that ? " The archbishop squinted up at the tall soldier . " The King 's Son of Heaven settled it for us , Sir Marshal , " he said . " Forty years or so ago when a son was born to King Henry II and given the name of Geoffrey . A few years later the king and his good queen were blessed with another son and they named him John . Geoffrey is dead but his son Arthur stands in his place today . " " My lord bishop , " declared the marshal , " I have been much in Englandin the last years and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better that we take John , whose faults are known to us , than a French princeling of thirteen years who has never set foot on English soil . The Lady Constance of Brittany , his mother , has trained him to hate us , to hold all French ways right and all English ways the ways of swine . With the barons of England , I do assure you , it is ten to one for John . And remember also it was the declared wish of our dead king that his brother succeed him . Al , I know what you are thinking , my lord bishop , " he went on , before the voice of the prelate could be raised in protest . " I know as well as you that John has been false to his vows , and a bad son and brother . But it comes to this . We can have John and peace or Arthur and civil war . This is no time to have a minor as king . " They disputed the question back and forth , the bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice of the barons . The latter stood out so determinedly for the lesser of the two evils that finally the churchman gave in . Sinking his numbed hands into the folds of his voluminous gown , he faced the English paladin with a resigned air . " So be it , Sir Marshal , " said the bishop . " Sound the Rouvel as a signal that the townspeople are to assemble . Let your heralds proclaim it to every housetop where the leopards flap in the breeze . Command the trumpets to sound . Richard is dead , long live King John ! It will be given out from every pulpit tomorrow at dawn . " The narrow Norman eyes of the churchman became no more than slits in his sallow face . He intoned in a solemn voice , raising a forefinger in the air : " Nothing of which you have done , Marshal , will you have such cause to repine as this ! "  |p124Richard  had listened to this discussion with emotions which churned inside him and made him want to cry out : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John the Traitor are old men ! Does it not seem to you that the youth of England would prefer our brave young Prince Arthur ? " He succeeded in biting back his dissent , however . There was a sudden tumult in the streets below : men 's voices raised in wonder and anger , a clash of arms and the thump of drums . The archbishop walked to a window and looked down into the square where in less turbulent times the merchants had been allowed to set up booths . The whole space was now black with people . " The word is out , " he said , turning back to address the marshal . " I tried to keep it a secret until such time as a successor could be named . But now they know out there that Richard is dead and they are waiting for a proclamation . We ca n't delay it any longer , Sir Marshal . " The two high officials of the Crown left the room and for a quarter of an hour Richard stood alone at the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rain had started to fall again , a moody kind of storm which seemed to drizzle in despondency but at intervals would goad itself into a fury and lash angrily at the rooftops and the turrets of the massive church . Nothing , however , could discouragethe crowds which had gathered on the square . It was clear now that the word had spread everywhere of the death of Richard of the Lion-Heart . Wild rumors as to the cause and manner of his death were being circulated . It was a plot of the treacherous French king , it was the work of the landless Prince John who wanted the throne for himself , it had been carried out by fanatical heathen from the East who had been sent by the Old Man of the Mountain , one of Richard 's deadliest enemies . " Kill ! Kill ! " was shouted in many tongues , together with more direct demands for the heads of the French king and John Lackland . " The common people are not for John , " said young Richard to himself , standing close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening . Then he heard the sound of trumpets and a silence settled quickly over the square . A loud voice proclaimed , first in French and then in English , that King Richard was dead and that his brother Prince John was to succeed him . As the words " Long live King John " rang out , there was a wild outburst from the crowds which might have been the result of pent-up feeling but which could be construed also as evidence that the succession was not a popular one . " The Black One " was a name by which John was known in taverns and market places and in shops whereP125the tongues of apprentices clacked , partly because he was black of hair and eye in contrast with the blond Plantagenets , partly because of his record for treachery . The term was heard repeatedly now as the excited voices below commented on the proclamation . " It 's some of his work , the Black One , " men were saying . And , " Jack Lackland has done for our great Richard at last ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the square to darkness and the persistent rainfall . Richard was summoned to attend the marshal and found him sitting in a small room off the chapter house where a decent fire blazed on the hearth . He had cold meat and a flagon of wine on a table beside him but did not seem to be much interested in them . " The die is cast , " said the marshal , motioning to the young knight to seat himself . " I have done the right thing ; but will I be justified by the results ? Whatever the outcome , we have sent word to John , proposing that he come here to be crowned first as Duke of Normandy . He will have his hands full for a time keeping the French provinces in line and his coronation in England will have to be delayed . " He paused and looked at Richard with a hint of weariness in his wide-spaced eyes . " John will not be a palatable dish to many . Here in Normandy they have not been able to forgive him his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show a proper degree of acquisitiveness . They have a nickname for him . Jack Lack . Do you suppose they will be pleased with King Jack Lack ? " " No , " answered Richard bluntly . " I find it hard to believe that anyonewill be pleased . " The marshal sighed and passed a hand over his brow . " I am at home when there is man 's work to be done but I am out of my depth when it comes to haggling about policy . " His voice fell away to a low mutter . " Priestly concerns , " he said . " Juggling of words and weighing of this and that . It 's not for me . Richard was my liege lord and my duty was to obey him . He gave it out as his will that John should succeed him . Richard is dead and so I am now John 's man . There is no other course for me but to stand by him ; even though I may feel doubts as to his fitness for the responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you any doubts about Prince Arthur , my lord ? " asked Richard . " Prince Arthur is a gallant boy . As handsome as his father , who was the best in looks of all the Plantagenets . He 's brave , high of spirit , chivalrous . I am very fond of him . " " Then surely he would make a good king . "   " As to that , one can only guess . There are reasons for doubt . His father was hot of temper and both sly and treacherous . His mother was capricious and filled with a bitter pride . If the prince is like his parents , he would not make a good king . But how can we be sure ? " He sighed a second time . " This responsibility , which I did not seek , is proving a heavy burden . I wish the decision had not rested on my shoulders . I will bear the blame if things turn out badly . " And now Richard himself was to take a hand in the tangled relationshipsof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some doubts about the mission with which he was being entrusted . " This is a weighty matter for one so inexperienced , my lord marshal , " he said . " You may be the very best envoy , " was the answer . " Let me see . You are twenty . Prince Arthur has just turned sixteen . Youth will speak to youth . You will understand each other . And no one will suspect so young a man of being the bearer of important advices . " You will need a strong party , " the marshal went on . " Half a dozen men-at-arms , a groom , a body servant , a priest to act as interpreter . And , of course , the worthy Tostig . You will need a suitable pretext for traveling at this particular moment and I suggest you declare yourself as seeking a chance to splinter lances with the knights of the western provinces . You can hold your own with the best of them . It would n't surprise me , in fact , if you emptied them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am against deception of any kind but I 'm afraid we must be somewhat devious in this case . To the extent , certainly , of carrying letters to prominent men in Bordeaux and Gascony . It may not be necessary to deliver them or to go to either city , for that matter ; but they will be in your possession and they will justify your presence on the road . " Richard had another question to ask . He hesitated over it , fearing that he had no right to inquire too closely into the matter in hand . Still , it would be better if he knew . After a moment or two of doubt he finally spoke . " Would it not be advisable , my lord , for me to know what this action is that the prince proposes to take and which you regard as dangerous ? " The marshal was now the one to show hesitation . He frowned at first ' and shook his head . " I am playing with fire , " he said . " The fewer whop127know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be in a position to speak with more authority . " He paused and then continued in a low tone . " King John is in England but his advisers here are in possession of the information . The king would not agree with the course I am taking but I know that I am right and that I must follow the dictates of my conscience . In the interests of justice and peace , the boy should be warned to give it up . The King of France has finally roused himself to positive action and is going to take the field by leading an army into Touraine . Of course we have always known that he wo n't be content until all of France is in his hands and the English have been driven out . But now Arthur is going to take sides with the French . " " Can he be blamed for that ? " asked Richard . " No , perhaps not . It 's still firmly fixed in his mind that he was robbed of his birthright , although he no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen him twice and we got along well . He 's bright and courageous and I do n't want anything to happen to him . But he 'll make a grave mistake if he follows his present plan . He proposes to cross the Loire with the strongest force he can raise and attack Mirebeau . " The marshal looked surprised when the young knight made no comment , and after a moment of silence he said : " It must be , Richard , that you do n't know who is living in the castle at Mirebeau . The old queen . Queen Eleanor , the widow of my first liege lord , King Henry . She is Arthur 's grandmother , of course , but he is prepared to take the castle by storm and make her his prisoner . " Richard now saw the folly of such a course . " He would be condemned by every man with any regard for the code of chivalry ! " he exclaimed . " He would never be forgiven . " " It 's his father coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geoffrey would stop at nothing . Blood ties were of no concern to him . You are right that the prince would put a stain on his name and I am determined to persuade him against it . You must not discuss the military side of it with him because we ca n't give our plans away by the same kind of loose talk he has been indulging . But I must tell you this much : if he strikes at Mirebeau , he will draw all our strength against him . As I said before , there will be dire consequences . I am hoping you can dissuade him from a course which would be fatal to him and most unpleasantly expensive to us in every way . Before you leave , I will go over with you the various arguments I think you should use . " A final word . The young prince is in the hands of bad advisers . He seems to be listening at this time to a wily and dangerous churchman . P128A man of Breton stock who won the nod of Rome and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Pourtran and he is called the Red Cardinal . Steer clear of him , whatever you do . He 's double-tongued , treacherous , and without a human scruple . The nature of your talks must be kept from the knowledge of this red-bearded priest if you hope to have any success . " And now , " continued the old man , " there 's another matter which concerns you personally . My boy , I am going to kick you out of the nest . " When Richard displayed his surprise by making no comment , the marshal proceeded to explain himself . " It 's time you ventured out into the world to make your fortune . As I did  --  so many , so very many , years ago . You are well trained now in the use of arms and I believe you have no superior in the lists . The world is full of opportunities for a young man with your qualifications  --  and your good appearance . And I do n't mind stating my opinion that you will be well advised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be constantly involved . It 's always a sad and unprofitable thing when brother fights brother  --  or uncle fights nephew . You should go to Rome . There is a Pope there today who is going to shake up the world . It was a good thing that , when the camerlingo tapped with his silver mallet on the forehead of Celestine and called him by his name , the old Pope could not respond . He was dead , as dead as a brown leaf tossed by winter winds . And so the cardinals sat down and selected Innocent III . " Innocent sits in the Lateran now and his head is full of wonderful plans . Go to him , my bold Richard . He will have work for you . But before you go , ride about France for a time and enter tournaments . As I did when I was your age . I 'm certain you have it in you to pick up a tidy fortune that way . When your eye has been sharpened and your backbone has become strong , leave the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Richard 's opinion of the estates of Savran-Dupre did not improve as a result of the visit he paid to the solar above the Great Hall . In the first place , it could be reached only by an outside staircase , on the steps of which a large flock of chickens had congregated . The knight stamped his way through them , sending them flying off with much indignant squawking . The solar itself was low-roofed and cramped andp129it contained one bed only . It was filled , moreover , with such a clatter of feminine activity that at first Richard hesitated to enter . Half a dozen handmaidens were busily repacking the clothing and supplies which had been brought the day before . " Such a dismal hole it is , " said the countess , giving the knight a nod and smile of welcome . " We 'll be on our way  --  somewhere  --  by this time tomorrow . " She was as comely as in her earlier years but showing a tendency to the matronly in figure , having brought a child into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing of time she had become more unconventional , even to the extent of discarding the wimple and going without a head covering of any kind when indoors . The long train of her tunic of blue baudequin ( from Baghdad , no less ) had been annoying her to such an extent that she had ordered it cut off ; and the remnants lay in a heap beside her chair with the golden scissors which had been used in the operation . A small handmaiden was down on her knees , removing the jagged effect with a busy needle . " My very dear Richard , " said the countess , " I am quite desolate . You have been with us so many years , and always you have seemed like another son . " " But my liege lord is right . It is high time I began to make a place for myself in the world . I have had the best of training and I have won my spurs . My lord has been giving me much good advice which I will surely follow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes . " But for a time I shall feel quite lost . " " But you will not . . . " The countess hesitated . " You will not go over to the other side ? I know your sympathies have always been with Prince Arthur . " " My lord 's advice is to take no part in it . So I am going first to try my luck against the knights of the west and then I am off for Rome . I hope to find a place in the train of some bishop palatine . " The countess sighed and lowered her voice . " How fortunate that you will escape all this strife ! No one is more strict in adhering to the dictates of honor than my dear lord and he finds it necessary so often to stand against the wishes of the king . Sometimes he comes to me very pale and very tired of it . But he does not give in , even though the king charges him openly with disloyalty . The charges are always quickly retracted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along without him . " A childish voice said from somewhere close at hand : " You are veryp130rude to me today , Richard . You have n't even noticed that I am here . " Richard turned and saw that one of the smallest members of the family was seated on the bed , kicking her heels against the sides and holding onto one of the posts . She looked very small indeed , seated up there , for the bed was large enough to accommodate both her father and mother and herself at night . She was very pretty , with the fine blue eyes of her mother . No one had yet thought of contriving clothes for boys and girls and so they were dressed like little men and women . The slender child on the bed wore a replica of the Lady Isabella 's blue gown , even to a train , and she had also a gold chain around her waist from which depended three loops of gold cord . " I apologize most humbly , my little Lady Isabella , " said Richard , bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , seated away up there . " " But you should have seen me , Richard . " " Leave Richard alone , child , " said the countess sharply . " He has much on his mind today . " " I know he has much on his mind , dear Mother . And it 's because of what he has on his mind that I think he should have noticed me . He is going to leave me . " " The children will all be disconsolate , " declared the countess . " You have always been a great favorite with them , Richard . I sometimes believethat all my little girls harbor a secret attachment for you . " " I do , " declared the Lady Isabella . The servants had been keeping their ears open and at this point all of them burst into involuntary laughter . It subsided quickly , for in spite of her usual kindliness and tolerance the countess could be very stern . She glanced about her now with an accusing eye and every head dropped and every pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down off the bed and walked toward the stairway . " Isabella , my child ! " called her mother anxiously . " Where are you going ? " " I am not sure , " was the reply , in a voice which showed the child was close to the point of tears . " I am going where I will not be treated this way . I hope to find my father . It is nice in his company because he never scolds or allows anyone "  --  her eyes swept stormily around the room  --  " to laugh at me . " " With your permission , " said Richard to the countess , " I will escort my lady Isabella to her father . " " Yes , Richard , do . While I have something to say to these lazy and impertinent people of mine . "  |p131They  went down the outside steps together , the small hand of the child raised high to rest on Richard 's arm , quite properly and primly , however . " I was very glad , my dear Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a good regard for me . I hope it means that you wo n't forgetme entirely now that I am going away for a very long time . Did you know that I leave today ? " The girl nodded her head slowly . " Yes , Richard . And I think it is very wrong of my father and my mother to let you go away . You will soon forget all about me . " " No , no , my lady , " said Richard . " The shoe is on the other foot . You are a very pretty child as , of course , you know . When you grow up , you will be as beautiful as your lady mother . " " Everyone tells me I will be more beautiful than my mother . And more beautiful than all of my sisters . " " You will be beautiful enough to break the hearts of many men , that is certain . And you will be a great heiress . You will have so many suitors that it will be hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earl , at the least . Perhaps your husband will be a prince of the royal line . By that time you will have forgotten all about a poor , landless knight like me . " " No , " said the child firmly.  |p132T  RAINED at intervals during the long ride across the north ofFrance and it was not until they had crossed the borders of Brittanythat the weather made amends and became as gracious and warm as a lovely woman 's smile . There were other changes at the same time which interested the party more . Gone were the chalky hillsides , the broad and leisurely rivers , the prosperous farms with their sleek herds . Gone the thrift and orderliness of the Normans . Richard shook his head in wonder at the round stone fences which they now encountered , and the hedged-in fields , and the haystacks built so high around the trunks of trees that only the top branches showed . The roads were beginning to climb and the wildness of the hills closed them in . Sometimes they saw heath lands dotted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorse but mostly it was a different world , dark and unfriendly with its gnarled trees and narrow valleys where the sun did not penetrate and the trillium grew thin and reedy . As the roads led farther up into the fantastic hills , the wonder of the wayfarers grew and they felt a tensity of mood , even a prickling of the spine , for a sound was always in their ears : the song of water pouring out of tangled brush . The brooks of Brittany seemed to have gone stark mad . They boiled in a frenzy to be away ( unaware that this gorgeous freedom would end so soon in the eternal sameness of the sea ) , they leaped with the delight of escape from the bondage of the immovableearth . " We are a people of contradictions , " said Father Pasquitien , the interpreter , who was a Breton . " We are as jealous of our liberty as these violent little streams of ours and yet we will not struggle against fate nor clamor for new rights like the English . We maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolmens because we have such respectp133for the past , and we have a saying , You will be wiser dead than living . ' Perhaps that is why we do not strive to bend this life to our will like the grasping Norman . " " What I would like to know is this , " said Richard . " Whether your people will struggle and clamor for the rights of Prince Arthur . " " He bears the name of the great king who slew the giant of Mont St. Michel , " was the answer . " But I do n't believe , Sir Knight , that the Breton people felt any deep disappointment when he was not made the King of England . We are as ready as any people to cry out against injusticebut at the same time we do not want our good young prince to be exiled from us in London . We think it right that he should stay here and rule Brittany . " There was a pause . " Still , you have asked a question and I shall answer you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he gives the word . What is more , Anjou and Maine and Touraine will stand behind Arthur against John . " " If that be true , " said Richard to himself , " my mission is doomed to failure . " Tostig was riding in the van as usual , watching every foot of the land and unerringly finding the right road . He turned at this . " You want Arthur to be the Duke of Brittany but not the King of England ? " he asked . " Can he be the one without being the other ? Since the Plantagenets came to England nothing is simple any more . An ordinancein London must be acceptable to the winegrowers of Bordeaux . And a king in England must rule also in Normandy and Brittany and Gascony . " They were climbing a road which twisted along the banks of a particularly turbulent stream and the noise of the water made speech difficult . It was not until they came out suddenly on a level stretch of land filled with sunshine from which could be seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had more to say . " I am not an oracle to tell you what my people will do . But it seems to me rather more than probable that , should Arthur go to London , we will demand that his sister , the Princess Eleanor , be made Duchess of Brittany . " Richard looked at the gray-clad priest in surprise . He had not been aware of the existence of a Breton princess . " While the prince stays at the court of France and lays plans with the French king  --  who will , of course , break any promises he may make  --  his sister acts here in his stead , " went on the priest . " We have become strongly attached to her . She knows the laws and she is prompt andp134just . It is the general opinion that we could have none better . And she is so beautiful that people call her the Fair Maid and sometimes the Pearl of Brittany . Our young men would gladly die for her . And yet she is the most unlucky woman in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she is as beautiful as you say , and if she rules the country so well , how then can she be counted unlucky ? " he said . " She has been the pawn of fate , young Sir Knight . She is a year older than Arthur and should before this have been married . Three times her hand has been sought in marriage by the most eligible of princes . First it was the brother of Saladin and they were to rule as King and Queen of Jerusalem . But he refused to change his religion . She was betrothed to the son of Leopold of Austria when the negotiationsfor the release of King Richard were under way . Some quirk of statecraft led to the breaking of the match . Then she was to marry Prince Louis , the heir to the throne of France , but when Richard made up his mind that John should succeed him , the French king decided it would not do for his son to marry a mere Breton princess . And so the Pearl of Brittany , the loveliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share the fate of the Unwanted Alice of France . " " All this makes me think I have lived too narrow a life , " commented Richard . " In the household of the great marshal we thought of nothing but the proper use of the lance and the care of our chargers . If any whisper reached us of the existence of this unfortunate lady , it passed in one ear and out the other . " He looked with some suspicion at his cowled companion . " Can it be , Father Pasquitien , that you are exaggeratingthe charms of the lady ? " " You will soon be able to judge for yourself , " was the answer . " In my opinion it will need no more than a glance . You will see our goldencrestedprincess with her eyes as blue as the heavens above us , and you will fall as completely and desperately in love with her as a full thousand men of knightly degree have done before you . " Tostig turned at this point and winked broadly at Richard . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rawen has unhorsed at least a score of French knights in the lists . Do you think him so weak that he will go down with one glance from a French maid who has already been jilted three times ? " " The rules are far different in the lists of love , Sir Squire , " declared Father Pasquitien . " A strong arm and a firm seat in the saddle avail the candidate nothing . "  | The turn in the weather had caused the ducal household to desert the tall granite castle within the walls of Rennes ; which had been a place of some greatness , it should be said , long before the Romans in-vadedGaul . Ten miles to the north , within sound of the brawling Vilaine , there was another castle to which the court had repaired . It lacked the high towers and the dizzy tourelles which were a feature of the strongholds of the day , and being in the form of a U , it was wide open to the warm breezes of spring . When the party came within sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle walls were covered with tents , over which floated the flags of Brittany and France . There were joint banners also above the barbican tower . The leopards of England were nowhere to be seen . " I have no liking for this , " said Tostig , shaking his head . " They are arming for war . Ca n't you feel it in the air ? And hate and anger as well ? We will be in luck if we come out of this alive . " A paunchy man with a thatch of black hair and intense eyes under heavy brows crossed the drawbridge and elbowed his way through the guards who were standing there . He stationed himself inside the barbicanand glared belligerently at the newcomers . " That is Robardi , " said Father Pasquitien . " It means trouble , my young friends . " " Who is Robardi ? " The priest motioned in a southerly direction . " He came from the wine country . In the days of the imposition . " Richard frowned in lack of comprehension . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had for it . When the father of our Prince I Arthur and of the Princess Eleanor was killed , the old English king compelled our Duchess Constance to take a second husband . He made the choice : a Norman earl from England . It is to be doubted if they were ever man and wife because there was nothing but dislike between them from the first but nevertheless the earl took over the control of everything . It was a very bad time for the people of Brittany because he imposed Norman laws on us and he brought in many Normans and imposed them on us . One of them was this carrion knave Robardi . He was humble enough then , a barber and drawer of teeth . He carried all the teeth he had ever extracted on a string around his neck . Thep136other officers are gone now  --  but Robardi remains . He is a man of some importance , young sirs , the seneschal of the ducal household . " The black-a-vised man made a gesture in their direction and called out something in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " said the priest . He joined the seneschal and for several moments the pair talked in their native tongue . Robardi spoke in loud tones and gestured emphatically , keeping his eyes for the most part on the silent travelers . Father Pasquitien returned then and gave them a worried nod . " Word of our coming has preceded us , " he reported . " Robardi says you are spies and must be treated accordingly . At any rate , you are to be questioned . Young men , I beseech you to be careful in what you say . Weigh your words well and  --  and tell them as little as possible . " " Is this black spider to do the questioning , Sir Priest ? " asked Tostig . Father Pasquitien shook his head . " No , my sons . You are to go before the cardinal himself . I am to conduct you there . " As they passed through the guards massed at the end of the drawbridge , the two Englishmen were more conscious than ever of the antagonismof the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged sullen remarks in undertones . They were like chained dogs , ready to spring if the leash were slipped . " We are walking into a trap , " declared Tostig . " I would enjoy getting the throat of this barber into my two hands . He would spit out all of his own teeth before I was through with him . " It was in the late afternoon and the sun was still in its friendliest mood . By way of contrast , the churchman who received them in a small room opening on the inner court was not friendly at all . This was the Cardinal Pourtran of whom the marshal had spoken in words of warning . He was as bald as a cube of ivory and so the name by which he was known , the Red Cardinal , could be ascribed to the glowing and well-tended beard which covered much of his chest and , perhaps , to the smoldering brown of his continuously active eyes . " What brings you to Brittany , Sir Knight ? " he asked in a grating voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , " declared the cardinal , " is a point which need not be explained . There is something unmistakable about the faces of you insatiableislanders . Also , I think I know something of you , young Sir Richard . You ride in the train of the Earl of Pembroke , marshal of England . Is it not so ? "  | " Yes , Your Eminence . I have been fortunate in the lists and I am venturing out in the hope of finding opportunities to splinter lances with some of your knights here in the West . " " You choose a strange time for this jaunt , " declared the churchman , who sat in an oversized chair , with his bare feet stretched out over a stool to get the benefit of the breeze . He turned his head abruptly and stared at Richard over his shoulder . " Is it possible that your splendid old marshal , who can be admired for his prowess at the same time that his slowness of wit is to be deplored , has assumed the role of Joshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , Your Eminence . " The cardinal indulged in some incoherent grumbling as he dropped his splayed feet to the stone floor . He took a sip of wine from a flagon at his side and rubbed the moisture from his lips with the end of his stole . " Do the young men of this degraded age have no knowledge of the Scriptures ? " he demanded . " Good St. Cyril and all the martyrs , deliver me from these barbarians who are concerned only with violence and bloodshed ! I see , Sir Knight , that I must inform you of my meaning . Joshua , the great leader who took the children of Israel across the Jordan , sent men in advance to spy out the land . Is my meaning clear now ? " Richard responded in heated tones . " I have taken the vows of knighthood , Sir Cardinal . Do you think I would descend to such baseness as spying ? " The churchman shrugged his shoulders . " It is well known , " he said , " that the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more grumbling and then suddenly pointed a finger at Richard . " The Devil is loose in France ! Get yourself back over the border before we hang you and your whole party ! I give you this advice in all honesty and in the hope you will have the good sense to act upon it . " There was a light knock on the door and a young girl was admitted whose very great attractiveness caused Richard to think she might be the Princess Eleanor . A second glance , however , convinced him that this could not be the case . Her hair , under a wimple of coarse white linen , was of the brownness of honey instead of the vivid gold which Father Pasquitien had described . He noticed also that her tunic was of homespunand that her bare feet were in sandals bound with woolen straps . She spoke to the cardinal in the native tongue and he answered her sharply.  |p138It  was clear during the conversation which followed that the cardinal did not approve of the message she brought , for he shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestured resignedly and turned to Richard . " Sir Knight , " he said , " it seems that our princess , who generally displaysmore good sense , has a desire to speak with you . She will receive you , briefly , before you start on your way back . " " It will be a great honor , " declared Richard . " But I beg to point out , Your Eminence , that I have not stated my intention of accepting your advice . " " But you will , " was the prompt response . " You have your choice . An immediate departure or the dance of the chats for you and your whole party . And , " he added with sudden vehemence , " see to it that your men do not stick their stinking Norman snouts into matters which do not concern them ! Tell them to ask no questions and to keep their eyes on the ground . A single false step on the part of any one of them and you will all pay the penalty for it . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were to follow her . Her footsteps , even in the wooden sandals , made scarcely a sound on the stone floor as she led the way from the room . Expecting to find Tostig deeply concerned over the difficulties of their position , Richard was surprised to see the eyes of his squire studyingthe trim lines of their guide . " She is graceful , " whispered Tostig . " This girl 's eyes are not only lovely but they are filled with a great sweetness . It 's clear she is a servant but there is a fineness about her which I do not understand . " " She is probably the confidential servant of the Princess Eleanor . They always have one . " Tostig sighed . " How lightly she walks ! Her hands are not the hands of a servant . " They crossed a U-shaped courtyard from which the crowded tents of the encamped forces could be seen . Beyond this was a dirt road which curved away in the general direction of Dol . A heavy cloud of dust obscuredthis road at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Richard in a low tone , realizing the danger of such comments . " Horsemen . A goodly company by the looks of things . "  |p139Tostig  sighed again . " There is not a trace of the servant in her voice . " The room where the princess received the knight was long and airy , opening on a garden where spring flowers blossomed in great profusion . Over the stone wall , which enclosed the garden , the colors of France and Brittany waved with what seemed an air of arrogance . In this respect they matched the mood . of the royal lady who had summoned him to appear . She was seated in the midst of a group of her ladies , all of them young and of apparent vivacity . They served no purpose so well , however , as to enhance her beauty by contrast . Father Pasquitien had given a valid report of her ; the Pearl of Brittany was of exceeding fairness . She gave Richard the benefit of a long and thorough look , but did not extend her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady who sat on her right . " He comes from the island of England , Marguerite , " she said . " Does it seem to you that he bears a fair imprint of the races from which he springs ? " The girl had not expected to be questioned . She flushed selfconsciouslyand stammered in answering . " I know not , my lady . I have given no thought to it . " " It is a cold and foggy land , " declared the princess , transferring her gaze back to Richard . " It is perhaps because they have to struggle for a mere existence that the people are so cold and treacherous . " She selected another of her attendants . " You , Guillaumette . Does it seem to you that he is of a knightly appearance ? " The girl Guillaumette was more self-possessed than the first one had been . She answered promptly . " He is indeed , my lady . " The response surprised the princess . " Do you really think so , Guillaumette ? I am surprised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that the hint of baseness in him , which is very easy to detect , tends to destroy whatever pretentions he may have to comeliness ? " " No , my lady . " Guillaumette gave Richard a quick glance before lowering her eyes . It was as though she had said , " I have my own opinions , Sir Knight , and I will insist on liking you no matter what she may say . " Richard had not moved his position while this brief discussion was carried on . The resentment he felt caused him to stand even straighter and to hold his head high . His cheeks were flushed . He took his eyes away from the angry princess and studied instead the peaked tents and the massed pennons showing above the top of the wall . In spite of the feelings she had aroused in him , he realized that herp140attitude was a natural one . She could not be expected to forgive the country which had passed over the rightful claims of her brother or the people who acquiesced in the injustice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said after a moment of silence , " I beg your permission to withdraw . " " I have other things to say . " She gestured imperiously . " The men of that distant island must be very tall , Sir Knight , if you are a fair sample of them . " " I am above the usual height , my lady . " There was another moment of silence which gave Richard a chance to study her more carefully . How haughty and regal she was , but how wonderful the beauty with which she had been blessed ! The priest had called her golden-crested but this seemed now a dull measure of praise for one whose fairness seemed to rival the sun . She had the Plantagenet eye , that blazing blue which could flash with temperament as readily as melt into disarming tenderness . It had now , alas , no hint of the latter quality . If there had been time he would have been impressed , without a doubt , by the contrast between her rich apparel and the drabness of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff and hard , and some chairs equally uninviting . The stone floors were bare , the walls were cracked and damp . The chimney seemingly had no capacity to carry away smoke and the ceiling was black with the fires of a generation . In such surroundings the Princess Eleanor seemed like a gorgeously plumed bird in a dismal cage . Her gown was of velvet , a scintillating green , most elaborately embroidered with thread of gold . A collar of miniver was turned down in a deep V to display the pure white delicacy of her neck . A girdle sparkling with jewels encircled her waist . Her shoes were sharply pointed and of a rich yellow velvet . " Your reputation has preceded you , Sir Knight , " she said . " You performwell in the lists . But it must be that your success has gone to your head because we are told you have come to match your skill against the best knights of our country . Is this not a case of overweaningpride in one so young ? " " I am prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill as I have was acquired under the training of the marshal of England . My purpose in venturing out now is to add to it by pitting myself against better men than myself . " " You have a quick tongue . This surprises me because I have beenp141told that the men of that gloomy island are slow of wit and clumsy of words . " " Your Highness seems to think very poorly of us indeed . " Her temper , which had been held on a loose rein , flared at this . " Can you and your countrymen be held in respect when you refuse to acknowledge the just claim of the Prince Arthur to the throne of England ? It has always been said that your marshal is a man of the highest honor . Why then did he take the side of the traitor John ? " " The decision was made for him , my lady . By the late king , who had declared his desire to be followed by his brother . " " It was done in a moment of resentment because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the training of my brother . Can a kingly whim override the acknowledged law of succession ? " Throughout this brief passage of words , the Pearl of Brittany had remained in a taut posture and there were patches of color in each cheek . At this point , however , she seemed to feel that she had gone far enough in making a visitor the butt of her resentment . She dismissed the question of the succession and began to ask personal questions . " From what line do you stem , Sir Knight ? " " I come in direct descent , " he answered proudly , " from the line of Sigurd of Rawen . Until the division of land after the Norman invasion , we were holders of extensive estates west of Windsor . My mother was of Norman birth . Her husband , before she married my father , was the Earl of Baudene . " " Oh ! I have heard about that . You are the disinherited son . You are indeed a champion in the lists . Have you also a voice for song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , my lady . Such voice as I have is suited only to battle songs . " The delicate arch of her very lovely nose seemed to twitch with distaste . " It sounds most barbarous . " She studied him with what seemed a degree of increasing disfavor , noting the plainness of his tunic and the lack of adornment on his hose ( even though his long legs filled them with elegance ) and his low shoes of fretted felt . " Our good cardinal , who is usually a man of the quickest decision , can not decide about you . He does not know whether you should be sent out of the country , with a strong enough guard to make sure that you recross the border , or whether it would be better to hang you as a spy at once . " " He mentioned both possibilities , my lady . "  | " I confess I find it hard to believe that one who has taken the vows of knighthood could descend so low as to act as a spy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allow me to assure you that I had no such purpose in coming to Brittany . I no longer belong to the household of the marshal of England . I am going out into the world , to make my fortune or to die in knightly adventurings . When I leave here I hope to go to Rome . " " This is most enlightening , Sir Knight . I may now make a suggestion which occurred to me as soon as I heard of your rash desire to face some of our knights in the lists . That wish can be gratified if you defy the worthy cardinal and stay for another day . You have heard , no doubt , of the Captal de Cham ? " Richard had heard a great deal about the Captal de Cham . He was a knight of Poitevin stock who had won such a resounding reputation in the lists that he had become a popular idol with the people . Because of his enormous size and the deadliness of his tactics in competition he was called the Sire Tohu-Bohu , which could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destruction and fire from the clouds , severed limbs and broken equipment and bloodstained hauberks on the turf . The Captal rode an enormous black stallion , the largest no doubt since the ancient Eohippus had been transformed into a horse . " Yes , my lady . I have heard much of the Sire Tohu-Bohu . " " He happens to be in attendance here . If you still have any appetite for a test , it could be arranged for you to run a course with him to-morrow . " It had never occurred to Richard that he might be called upon to face the Captal de Cham . Because of his great size , the latter was not included when men spoke of the relative merits of the knights of the day . He was considered a cast-back to the time of the paladins of Charlemagne when men fought like gods . Despite the dismay he could not help feeling , Richard bowed and answered , " It shall be as my lady wishes . " The Pearl of Brittany studied him for a moment with raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been keeping his gaze elsewhere but , when she made no immediate response , he looked directly at her . Their eyes met , and held . It was as though she were seeing him for the first time . He could tell that she was experiencing a change of sentiment toward him . The antagonism was gone and in its place he was sure he detected respect and approbation . There was ,  |p143even  , a hint of something deeper , a personal liking ; and the possibility that this was true caused him to feel sudden exultation . " Are you quite sure , Sir Knight , " she asked finally , " that you want to meet the Captal de Cham in the lists ? " " I am quite sure , my lady . " There was a pause . She seemed reluctant to have the matter settled . " Then , " she said , " the arrangements will be made at once . You have our permission to withdraw . " Richard left the room in a state of conflicting emotion . Uppermost was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation a prisoner of noble blood experienced when he had been convicted and was led from court with the edge of the ax turned toward him . Tostig was standing in the hall in the company of the maid of the princess . " We are staying for another day . " The maid gave Richard a startled bow . " Then I shall show you to your room , my lord , " she said . " Is it wise ? " asked Tostig in a whisper , as they followed her down the hall . " Have you forgotten what the cardinal said ? " " I am quite sure it is not wise , " answered Richard . " But we remain nevertheless . I am to fight in the lists tomorrow . With the Captal de Cham . " " Master Rick ! " Tostig 's voice was an indication of the consternation he felt at this prospect . " The Captal ! He 's not a man , he 's a monster , a creature from the Pit ! No one can face him . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which there is no retreat . " Tostig stopped still and regarded Richard with unhappy intentness . " There must be a way . Has not the cardinal ordered us to leave the country at once on pain of death ? Could we have a better excuse for leaving ? " " His decision has been overruled . We have the permission of the Princess Eleanor to remain another day . If I drew back on any such pretext , I should never again dare show my face in knightly company . " " By St. Willibrod ! " exclaimed the squire . " This is a serious pass to which you have brought yourself . I tell you , Master Rick , the man has the strength of a fiend . He has never been unhorsed --  " " He never faced the marshal of England . " " That is true . But the marshal had a strength granted to few men . It would have been a meeting of giants had they ever met in the lists . It may be that in time you will be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you aware that many of the knights who have faced the Captal have not lived to tell the tale ? " " It is a risk I must take . " It developed that one concession was being made to Richard 's rank and reputation : it would not be necessary for him to sleep on the rushes in the Great Hall with all the other visitors . There may have been anotherreason : that he must be kept from seeing or hearing too much of the preparations for war which seemed to fill all of Brittany . At any rate , he and his squire were escorted to a room they would share together , a tiny cubicle below the level of the ground . It lacked a single stick of furnishing , and a narrow slit near the ceiling , through which the water from the moat washed at every disturbance of the surface , provided the only relief from darkness . The floor was covered with rushes of such age and moldiness that the room stank of disintegration . Tostig proceeded to take the rushes together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in doing so disturbed a whole family of toads . These he tossed out into the moat through the slit in the wall . " Giselle heard some of what was being said , " declared the squire as he performed this task . " She said the princess was in an angry mood . " " Her name is Giselle ? Do you realize that she bears a resemblance to her mistress ? I was aware of it as soon as I entered the room . In the face of the reproaches heaped upon me , it slipped from my mind . " " It is natural that there should be a resemblance , " declared the squire . " They are sisters . " " Sisters ! Are you sure ? " Tostig nodded . " I caught a glimpse of the princess when you were shown through the door . I saw then how much alike they were . I asked Giselle about it . At first she shook her head and said nothing . But I persistedand finally she gave in . Prince Geoffrey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way with women . " " A failing that most princes have . " " Her mother was a domestic in the household of a goldsmith in Rennes . She died when Giselle was young but the girl was kept on as a sort of drudge . The two sisters saw each other for the first time when Eleanor was riding through Rennes with a large party and Giselle ran out to the street to watch her pass . The poor child was dirty and almost in rags but the princess reined in her horse at once and said to her attendants : There can be no doubt about it this time . Here is another of them . ' She seems to have taken a fancy to the child and , when her mother the duchess died , she had her brought to the palace . "  | " Are they still fond of one another ? " " Giselle worships the ground on which the princess walks . She enjoysmany privileges . From the few hints she gave me , I concluded that she has the confidence of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never have I known you to take such an interest in a woman . Can it be that the stern and practical Tostig is no different from other men after all ? " The gravity of Tostig 's face did not lessen . He nodded soberly . " This is the woman for me , " he said . " None other would ever suit me . " " You do n't often come to a decision as quickly as this . It 's barely an hour since you first set eyes on her . " The squire answered in an almost rapt tone . " I did not need as much as an hour , Master Rick . She is so sweet , so wholesome , so pleasing to the eye . She won me at the first glance . While you talked with the mistress , I made good use of the time . I pressed her with questions . She was reluctant to answer many of them , being of a becoming modesty . But I had a thirst to know everything about her and I would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Richard , " that Englishmen are in such bad odor here . I 'm much afraid the fair Giselle will not look with favor on your suit . If it 's your intention to go to such an extreme length as offering to marry her . " The squire 's face took on an even greater suggestion of gravity . " Such is indeed my intention , " he declared . Sounds of revelry reached the ears of the English visitors that eveningfrom the direction of the Great Hall but they were not permitted to participate . Instead , servants brought in dishes of the roughest earthenwareand flagons of wine , which they placed on the damp and sour stones between the two mounds of rushes . " They are taking every precaution , " said Richard . " In case we are spies . He was disappointed , for he had hoped to see the beautiful princess again when the company sat down to dine . The food brought them , however , was both ample and satisfying . Richard recognized all of the dishes , for they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal . There was a dish of bouilli , steaming hot in spite of the distance it had been carried from the kitchens . There was alsop146La Bardette , a cabbage stuffed with larded hare , quail , and mashed chestnuts . This was a famous Breton dish . It would generally be carried in to the sound of pipes and with cooks and jesters capering and prancingin front of it . There was also a fish from Lower Brittany and , finally , a monstrously sweet concoction of wine and honey and saunders , cooked with figs in a batter of flour and cut into crisp leechings . The two men had small appetite for such satisfying fare . They sat on either side of the dishes and picked lightly at the food . " Father Pasquitien was right , " said Richard , who had fallen into a thoughtful mood . " The rules are indeed different . To look into eyes as lovely and proud as those of the Pearl of Brittany is more dangerous than the thrust of a lance . Every word she said to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master , like man , " said Tostig . " Did your fair Giselle tell you much about herself ? " " She was very guarded at first but before we were through she was chattering like a magpie . Such a lovely magpie ! Her great fear is that she will be forced into a marriage . There was an old man in Rennes , a notary with very considerable property . He had won the ear of the Baronne Verduse , who is the head of the household  --  where the girls have coined a name for her , Madame Attifeuse  --  by the offer of a handsomepresent . But the princess saw that Giselle was against the idea and she said no , a much better match must be arranged . There is now another suitor . He is even more persistent than the elderly notary . It is this carrion knave , the seneschal . " " The man Robardi ? " Tostig nodded grimly . " The fellow pretends to be much in love with her . He stares at her with his evil eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything about it , particularly as the princess has not yet declared herself . " An angry flush mounted on the squire 's cheeks . " What I think of Master Robardi is this : I think he is a spy of King John of England . " Richard considered this possibility . " I believe you may be right . It 's said the king pays well for information and that he has his spies everywhere . This ex-barber might be one of them . " He nibbled at a crisp stick of the batter pudding . " You seem like to suffer a great disappointment , Tostig , for I can see no way in which you may advance your suit . " " And what of yours , Master Rick ? " " Mine ? " Richard indulged in a laugh which was intended to showp147lack of concern , even scorn . " I grant you that the princess is hard to resist . Every glance she gave me was like a sword thrust , and yet my admiration continued to mount . But it will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in . " God grant , Master Rick , that you have the sense to resist her charms . There will be trouble and unhappinessfor you if you do n't . " He paused . " I had no more than a brief glimpse at her through the door . Is the resemblance between the sisters so marked ? " Richard nodded thoughtfully . " The princess has golden hair , which makes a great difference . In point of features they are much alike . They have the same nose and the same line of brow . There is , more particularly , a matter of expression , a tendency to widen the eyes in smiling ; which , no doubt , they got from their Plantagenet father . Dress your Giselle up in silks and furs and put a golden wig on her head . Then it would be hard to tell them apart . " The conversation dwindled at that point and finally ceased . The shadow of the Sire Tohu-Bohu settled over them and they thought of the dire things which might happen the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a look at this great bogeyman , " he said . " How can you hope to hold your own unless you have an accurate measure of him ? You must know how to direct the aim of your lance . I must see what bits of information may be picked up . There will be much talk about the match among the servants . " Richard protested . " It 's against the cardinal 's orders . If you are caught asking questions , we shall all hang . I would rather not come to my end in any such sorry mess . " " The risk must be taken . It 's my duty as your squire to bring you such information as I can . Who knows , this great Goliath may have certain weaknesses . If he has , it will be talked about where the squires sit down to meat . Yes , Master Rick , it must be chanced . " The first flush of dawn was in the sky when Richard wakened . He had the room to himself save for a rustling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of his squire meant trouble . Something slithered by on the slimy floor and he hastily drew his feet up under him and crouched against the wall , having no liking for this kind of visitor . Further reflection brought some reassurance . Ifp148Tostig 's activities had been detected , he himself would have been involved in the consequences by this time . His mind resumed the train of reflection which had filled it during his last waking moments . He repeated every scornful word spoken by the Princess Eleanor . He carried a perfect picture of her in his mind , the proud tilt of her golden head , the coldness of the eye she had fixed upon him ( in which , nonetheless , there was a hint of tenderness , althoughnot for him , alas ) , the delicate modeling of her nose which no goldsmith could ever hope to equal , the ivory perfection of her hands . The instinct of the poet , which was latent in all men of Saxon blood , wakened in him . " My great and lovely lady , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all human beings but the more desirable for that . You are like the red gold of dawn and the burning sunshine of midday but also you are the quiet blue of dusk and the silver path that the moon makes in the silence of the woods . You can be like the storm which comes out of an angry sky but to those you deign to favor you are the rainbow which marks its end . Your loveliness is beyond descriptionor comparison or even comprehension . " He paused at that and grinned guiltily in the darkness . " Truly my head is full of flummery . I know I shall never see this beautiful lady again , this angry demoiselle who has such contempt for me . " There was a cautious step in the stone hall and Tostig entered the room . He carried a lighted torch which he fixed in an iron ring on the wall . Then he turned and regarded Richard with a somber eye . " Time to be up , " he said . It was like the old days when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long legs and ran a hand through his tousled hair . " Have you been out all night ? " he asked . " I drank with the last of them in the guardroom . Then I came back and had a few hours ' sleep . It was just as well I came , for a black water snake was curled up at your feet . An hour ago , I went out again . " " Have you anything to tell me ? " A grim intentness settled over the squire 's face . " I saw your opponent last night . He sat beside the cardinal and he made the churchman look like a sly little red squirrel . The fellow is a full half foot taller than you and he has a face like an angry , grinning owl . They tell me his horse is an enormous black . " " What were they saying in the guardroom ? " " You should have heard how they laughed last night , thinking what their man would do to you . Such cackling and blowing off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hulking codshead , and I rolled him in a muck heap ! " " They are all certain he 'll win ? " " Huh ! The slutching fools are sure you 'll he spitted like a gamecock and carried off the field in pieces . " He came to a halt beside the pile of rushes and stared at his master ; for although a free man he still thought no other term proper . " There 's one chance , Master Richard . If you try for his shield , you 'll think you have come dead on against an iron mountain on hoofs . You must aim for the visor . I sat for hours , listening to the jabber of these country fools , and I found out one thing . No one has ever tried for the visor because he sits so high above them . He 'll be taken by surprise . You must contrive to hit him high and hard . " " One chance only in ten that I could do it , " declared Richard , getting to his feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like aiming at the moon . " " I tell you it 's the only way , " said the squire earnestly . " He 's as slowwittedas a bull . If you seem to be aiming for his shield and do n't swing your lance upward until the last moment , he 'll be taken so much by surprise that you may scoop him right out of his saddle . " " I must win ! I must ! " declared Richard passionately . " She must keep that much memory of me at least ! " " Yes , you must win . And a little practice before anyone rubs the sleep out of his eyes will be useful . There 's a quintain behind the seats . I 'll raise it to allow for the extra height in the saddle . The spot to strike is where the visor is attached to the helm . If you get him there , he 'll take the impact of it on his forehead . It will unsettle his wits if it does nothingelse  --  and he 'll go into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tostig was talking in this vein to strengthen the young knight 's confidence . Both of them knew that the giant would come down the course like a black wind trussed in steel , like the high waves of an angry sea . Only by the greatest skill could such sheer brute strength be met and sustained . " Fetch Messire out , " said Richard , " and I 'll practice at the quintain . I 'm sure you are right . This is my only chance . " Tostig returned Messire to his stall and then joined Richard in the room under the moat . The latter was still sweating from his efforts in the practice field and his spirits had lifted perceptibly . They stood still for a moment and smiled at each other.  | " Ten drives at the quintain , " said Tostig . " Nine times you hit the spot I had marked , fairly and squarely . The other time you were two inches high . Beware those two inches , Master Rick . They might cause your lance point to slip off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock on the door and Richard 's " Come ! " brought the maid Giselle into the room . She hesitated on the threshold and looked at them cautiously , first at one and then the other . " Good Sir Knight , " she said , addressing Richard in a tone little above a whisper , " there is something you should know . " " You have risen early to tell me . " " No , my lord . We rise with the dawn . My mistress stirred as soon as I did and her ladies came in to sit on her bed and drink their morning posset together . It is always the pleasantest time of day for them . They are not yet trussed up so tightly and their feet are free . They sit about and gossip and it is very nice . I am permitted to sit in the room and listen . So I heard everything that was said . " " I am sure , " declared Tostig , " that they were saying the same things that I heard in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no chance against their great Captal . " The girl looked at him with deep concern in her eyes . " You should not have been there ! " she exclaimed . " Oh , messire , I trust you asked no questions . It is said the cardinal will have you all hanged if you are inquisitive . " Tostig 's face flushed with gratification at this proof of her concern for him . " I learned first that none of the guards have any reason for loving the cardinal . There will be no tale-telling for his benefit . " " Messire , I trust not ! It would be a very sad thing if any of you came to harm . " " But , " interrupted Richard , " have you been wise in coming to see us here ? What would the Red Cardinal think about it ? " Giselle stole one glance at him and then lowered her eyes . " It does not matter . All that matters is for you to know what was said . Guillaumette , who always spits out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of it . She said what a pity it would be if such a fair and graceful knight came to grievous hurt because of being matched against one so heavy and strong . All the others agreed with her and there was much shaking of heads . My mistress said it was a matter of no consequence . He is only an Englishman , ' she said . But such a handsome one ! ' cried Guillaumette . It will be one less to stand in the way of their rightful lord and king , ' declared my mistress . But , my lord , I knew she did notp151mean it . I always know what she is thinking . I said to her , Dear lady , your head is beginning to ache . You are going to have one of your spells : I am afraid so , my child . " I must darken the room , ' I said . You must not say another word . I will get the hot bandages at once . ' So all her ladies left and I came right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this concern me ? " asked Richard , frowning . " My lord , my sweet mistress has no headache . That she was willing to pretend was because she wants to give you a chance to escape this dreadful jousting . You see , my lord , the tilting would have to be postponedif the Princess Eleanor could not be there . Word would then be sent to the cardinal that she thought it unwise for you to remain longer in the country and he would send you on your way . Not a word was said between us but my mistress knows I am here and she is hoping that you will be sensible and go . " " My honor is at stake , " declared Richard . " Oh , good Sir Knight , there would be no dishonor ! " " What will your mistress do if I am not sensible ? " " She will fall into a rage . She will say to me : Take these bandages away and open the curtains ! Bring all those chattering trollops back so I can speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes will be full of fire and she will say to them : My head no longer aches , which is good becausenow I shall be able to watch our splendid Captal split this presumptuousEnglishman like a larded cock ! ' " " You make a good advocate , my girl , but I have no intention of forcing the princess to remain a prisoner for as much as an hour to save me from a compact into which I entered of my own accord . Convey my thanks to your mistress for her kind intent but assure her that nothingcan prevent me from breaking a lance with the mighty Captal as arranged . " " But , Sir Knight ! " The girl 's eyes had opened wide with compassion and fear . " He is a giant , an ogre ! He can break a lance in his two hands . And they do say he has made a bargain with the Devil ! No man can stand before him . He will kill you ! " Since tilting at the quintain , Richard was feeling somewhat easier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liege lord , the marshal of England , could have broken your mighty Captal in two as easily as he can break a lance . " " Your champion is large and strong , " added Tostig . " But there is still , by Our Lady , the matter of skill to be considered . "  |p152When  the girl had left , reluctantly because she had failed in her purpose , Richard said to his squire , " Your little Giselle will make you a fine wife . " " " Neither one of us , " declared the somber squire , " will live to see anotherday ! "  |p153The  NINE shrewd blows he had directed at the quintain , the skillhe had learned from the great English marshal , the supplenessof youth  --  these were points in his favor , as Richard knew well . But he knew also , even before he saw the great Captal de Cham appear in front of the red silk pavilion which had been pitched for him at the other end of the lists , that all the advantages he could claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sport of chivalry , and there was a legend of invincibility behind the dread Sire TohuBohuwhich would add assurance to his lance and security to his saddle . The Princess Eleanor had been right on one count : he , Richard of Rawen , had shown presumption in declaring his desire to splinter lances with the champion of the west . He needed the additional strength of arm and weight of bone which a few more years would bring him . Tostig was adjusting the metal chausses on his thighs . It was not necessary to wear poleyns over the kneecap in tournament play but after a moment 's pause the cautious squire laced them on . " Why take unnecessaryrisks ? " he asked . " This great codshead of a Poitevin is as clumsy as a bear ; he might miss the shield and strike the knee , and it would be a sad thing to be lamed for life because of a moment 's lack of care . " Master Rick , " said Tostig , transferring his attention to the shoulders and attaching ailettes carved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ugly mood . They will be calling for blood . To them you represent the traitor john and the barons of England who have robbed their prince of his rights . They wo n't be satisfied to see you unhorsed . Nothing will suit them so well as to see this great Blunderbore kill you or injure you so you 'll never ride again . " Richard walked to the entrance of his pavilion , which was smaller and not nearly as richly decorated as that of the giant , although it car/lied a red lion standing on one paw . He raised the flap over the entrance . The sun by this time was so directly overhead that it seemed to be watching what went on in this small space of ground enclosed by wooden palisades to the exclusion of the rest of the world . There was not a cloud in the sky and the air was so still that the pennons flying above the pavilions and at intervals along the barricades were as limp as the tails of sick hounds . Rooks had congregated in colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cawing , in curiosity or protest according to the mental attitude of the individual spectators . jugglers and tumblers , vying for attention on the outskirts of the crowd , were having small success . Richard 's eyes took in the noisy mobs pressing against the palisades and he shook his head . " I had no idea there would be so many of them , " he said . " The roads from Rennes and from Dal in the north have been black with them since dawn . Noblemen with long trains of retainers and great ladies in their curtained litters , and the common rabble trudging on shanks ' mare . They 're all out there now  --  gentlemen and priests and men-at-arms , thieves and cutpurses and peddlers with their wares . Not half of them will be able to see what goes on . But if there 's a riot afterward , they 'll be having a hand in it . " Tostig had joined the young knight at the entrance and was staring out from the other side of the flap . " If you tumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palisades  --  as they may  --  get your sword out quickly . Keep it in your left hand and the lance in your right , and use them both right briskly . If we must sell our lives , let 's exact a high price in sluggish Breton blood ! " Richard 's gaze was now turned to the raised seats reserved for the spectators of high degree . They were already well filled . The ladies in their gorgeous tunics , and with jeweled barbettes in their hair , and the men in cloaks with heraldic devices on breast and arm and brimmed hats with long dyed plumes , made a brilliant combination . Only a space in the exact center was still unoccupied . " The princess is late in arriving , " he said to himself . " We will know when she comes by the stir it will make . How they will wave their hats in the air and cheer for her ! " The little Giselle will not be here , " said Tostig . She had n't the heart for it , fearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that ? " " I saw her , " explained the squire , with a not too successful attempt atp155casualness . " As I led Messire out from his stall , she was passing with a bundle in her arms . A most fortunate chance , I thought it . I had a few words with her . " There was a sound from all parts of the field and hats were waving everywhere . The empty space had been filled . The princess , Richard saw , was gowned in blue with ermine at her throat and wrists . " We shall conquer or die , " he said , " with the loveliest eyes in the world watching us . " " He parted the silken curtains and stepped out into the open . Tostig followed , carrying his lance . Richard walked to Messire , who was pawing nervously at the sod , and laid an affectionate hand on his mane . " My brave Messire , " he said . " This will be a test for both of us , my old friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , but of this I am sure : you will have no fear of the black stallion we must ride against . There will be no standing on ceremony this time , no refusing to run against an ill-trained charger . " Messire raised his head and shook it as though in answer . He pawed at the ground still more vigorously and snorted in defiance . " That is the spirit ! " said Richard . " If we lose , it will not be your fault . " The voice of the herald could be heard , proclaiming the nature of the event . " To horse ! " said Tostig in a restrained voice . " The time has come , Messire ! " said Richard , giving the glossy mane a final affectionate tug . When he had helped Richard into the saddle , the squire busied himself with adjusting the gear of the restless horse . " Remember what I said , Master Rick , " he whispered . " Those two inches . Be not too high . Smite him squarely on the forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " May God and all the saints direct my eye ! " In accordance with usual custom , Richard as the challenger rode directlydown the field and struck the shield of the Captal de Cham , which was hanging oyer the front of his pavilion . It was unusually large and kite-shaped , as black as night , and bore the moline cross because the Captal had been an eighth son and was therefore devoid of inherited land . Richard smote it vigorously with the steel point of his lance and it rang out as Ioudly as a church bell and seemed likely to slip its attachmentsand fall to the ground.  | " A outrance ! A outrance ! " cried the crowd , delighted that it was to be a duel with naked lances and not one with blunted tips . Richard then began the customary progress around the field with his lance held high in the air . With his other hand he touched the neck of his proud charger . " Head up , my old rampager ! " he said . " Tail high , and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of a proud , scornful , beautiful lady are on us . " Messire responded by tossing his head and beginning to caracole as he followed the oval line of the enclosure . When they passed the raised seats , Richard lifted his lance still higher in the air as a salute to the princess and her ladies . He was rewarded by a barely polite spatter of applause from those around her which was drowned out by the massed crowds behind the palisades , who hooted and hissed and bellowed their unfriendliness . As soon as Richard had reached his station , he saw that his opponent was already in position at the opposite end of the lists . He caught his breath in surprise . All that he had heard of the size and might of the great Sire Tohu-Bohu had not prepared him for the actual stature of the man . The Captal 's black charger was enormous enough to seem like a creature straight from the least probable pages of mythology but it appeared barely capable of sustaining the weight of its rider . On what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a breastplate been fashioned , such a gorget and vambrace been hammered out , such taces and greaves and sollerets ? The knight with whom he was to compete in the grimmest of all the grim games that a rough age had been capable of conceiving seemed as little human as the ogres he had believed in as a boy . He took his eyes away from the motionless partner of Death at the far end of the courses and gave a glance up at the sky . " God and the King 's Son of Heaven and Our Merciful Lady ca n't mean me to die , " he thought . " Not on such a perfect day ! " Standing beside him , the grim-lipped Tostig repeated his word of warning . " Remember that narrow margin of space . Be wrong by as much as two inches and you will fail . Clip this bogeyman under the helm , Master Rick . " There was a flourish of trumpets and the Princess Eleanor raised a baton of gold above her head . The chargers at each end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time on the part of the eager Messire . He knew this was war and he plunged forward with a burst ofp157speed which carried him beyond the halfway line . The Captal on his black steed came on at a less precipitous gait but this did not detract from the aura of menace which rode with him . It was a matter of seconds only until they met but Richard had time to think of many things . It had been an easy enough matter to clip the quintain time after time on the exact spot marked by Tostig but now he was not charging a dented shield hanging loosely on a wooden post . His mark was the most dreaded knight in all France and behind the visor , which he must strike , was a face as fiercely hostile as a hunting owl 's . He could see little but the distended and fiery eyes of the black stallion and the point of a lance stretched out to bear him to the ground . Richard kept his lance low and it was not until the tossing manes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward and struck the visor of his antagonist . He knew at once that he had found the exact spot . The point did not slip away from its mark and the impact could be felt all through his body , while the lance splintered in his hand . At the same instant he experienced a sensation as though the earth and the mountains thereof and the sun and the stars had all fallen upon him . The lance of the Poitevin struck his shield with such force that he was crushed . back against the rear of his saddle . Even in this moment of chaos , when earth and sky split wide open , his hand did not loosen on the reins . Messire , checked in his top stride , reared up on his hind legs , pawing frantically at the air and screaming in the excitement of conflict . Could any human or equine sustain such a shock without collapsing backward on the green turf ? Could even so skilled a hand as Tostig 's have tighteneda girth to hold under such a strain ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself clutching the side of a precipice formed by the upright back of his splendid steed . He realized that he had not been hurled from his saddleby the hammer blow on his shield . It was equally to be marveled at that Messire had kept his balance . His opponent had not been as fortunate . The unexpectedness of the blow on his visor had bent the Captal so far back that no saddle devised by the shrewdest armorer could have kept him in his seat . He was floundering on the turf , his feet higher than his head , his splintered lance still grasped in his gauntleted hand . His charger , floundering beside him , had not yet found its feet . For a moment no sound came from the stunned spectators . Thenp158throats regained the power of loud utterance and the air resounded with cries pitched in bitter rage and menace . The fondest legend of the Western world had been shattered , the invincible Sire Tohu-Bohu had gone down before a mere stripling and would no longer be a name to dangle in pride before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his saddle without motion and with his sword drawn , saw the wave of angry humanity break over the flimsy barricadesand come rolling out into the enclosure . He thought , " Have I survived one danger to encounter an even greater ? " Then he saw that Tostig had managed somehow to reach him and was standing at his stirrup with a pike in his hand , and a sense almost of relief took possessionof him ; the companion of his whole life was here and might find a way out for them as he had always done . At the worst , they would go down together . But the resolution and mettle of the angry mob was not to be put to the test . A sound of trumpets was heard outside the lists . The onsurgingwave paused , then came to a stop . The wooden gates at the challenger 's end of the field were thrown open and a party of horsemen rode through . At the head of the newcomers was a very young man in light armor , with a sleeveless surcoat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was as gold-crested as that of the fair Princess Eleanor ) was covered by a felt hat instead of the usual metal cap . A squire rode behind him , carrying his shield . There was not a moments ' doubt in the mind of anyone as to his identity . Prince Arthur had returned , somewhatsooner than he had been expected . They heard him cry in a high boyish voice , " Maledictions , we are too late ! " " It seems so , Your Highness , " said one of the knights riding behind him , " And yet we came on at a rare good pace , messires and good companions , once the word reached us of what was afoot . " Then the prince observed the recumbent figure of the champion of the West still stretched out on the turf . He stiffened with amazement . " God 's ribs ! " he cried , in imitation of his Plantagenet uncles , each of whom had chosen some part of the celestial body for purposes of emphatic speech . " The Captal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse on entering the lists ? " The explanation was given him and he sat his horse for several momentsin puzzlement and a sense of loss . " By all the saints , it is hard top159believe ! " he declared finally . " I would have wagered a half of my possessions  --  allof which my fair uncle is claiming  --  that our great champion would have brushed this English youth aside like a bothersome gnat . Perhaps it is as well , messires , that we were spared such a bitter sight . " Then he grasped the significance of the crowded course . His share of the violent Plantagenet temper drove all semblance of beauty from his boyish face . " Mordieu , what is the meaning of this ? " he demanded . " Who has allowed this greasy rabble to invade the field of honor ? Clear them out . Rid the lists of them at once . If they resist , hang every man jack of them ! " Fortunately the noisy crowd was driven back behind the barriers by less drastic means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the householdof the marshal , he had never known comfort . Never once had he eaten , slept , dressed , undressed , or washed alone . They had been like a movable beehive . They swarmed down on a castle , filling it to the battlements and eating all the supplies of food and making great inroadson the wine casks before moving on . The Norman castles in England consisted of the Great Hall , the kitchens , and the guardroom for the most part . The lord and his lady slept in tiny niches sunk into the thick walls , which offered little privacy and no comfort . A pallet of straw was the closest he himself had ever come to the softness of a bed . It was a surprise , therefore , to find that the castle on the Vilaine was large enough to absorb the train of the Breton rulers and still allow some privacy . When Richard received a summons to wait on Prince Arthur , he was led through the Great Hall and into a passage from which opened many doors . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant announced , " The English knight , my lord duke , " and vanished , leaving Richard alone on the threshold . It must not be assumed , however , that the room represented any high degree of luxury . There were tapestries on the walls but under them the masonry was damp and there was an unmistakable mustiness on the air . The prince had a bright , shining face and a liking for color on his back . His jacket was red , his diamond-checkered hose blue and gold , his shoes ( turned up at the toes in a fantastic exaggeration of the style )  |p160green  . He was thin but handsomely proportioned and he seemed to walk on springs , making no sound when he moved . He looked at Richard and nodded his golden head . " How did you do it ? " he demanded abruptly . Richard knew , of course , to what he referred . " I went for the visor , " he answered . " High . I struck just under the helm . It threw him completelyoff balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed ! " cried the prince . " I would have been disgraced . I took the chance of that , my lord duke . " The prince repeated his " God 's ribs " and declared he would regret his absence to the end of his days . " You know , Sir Knight , " he confided , " I was not entirely sorry that you won . He 's a sour old dog , this Poitevin . I do n't believe I 've ever heard him speak . He grunts . He eats enough for three men . His wife is as big as a Flemish foot soldier but all his mistresses are tiny creatures . There 's nothing human about him . " He drew his sword and made a high pass at the wall as though repeating the lance stroke which had destroyed the legend of the invincibleTohu-Bohu but his mind had gone on to something else . " Foxy says you 're a spy . Are you ? " " I am not a spy , my lord prince . I do n't return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A pleased look took possession of the prince 's face . " I knew he was wrong . It 's a good thing to catch him this way ; he 's always so right about everything that I grow tired of his perfection . " It was evident that he spoke of the Red Cardinal . After a moment he gave his head a knowing nod . " But you are here for a purpose , young Englishman . I am sure of that . Confess now that I 'm right . " " You are right , my lord prince . I came to see you . To deliver a message . A warning . " " I knew it ! " The prince was so pleased with himself that he indulged in something resembling a caper . " I can hardly wart to tell Foxy that he was wrong and I was right . " " Unless I have your promise , my lord prince , that you wo n't discuss it with His Eminence , I am under orders not to deliver the message . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's from William the Marshal . Dismal Will . I suppose he wants me to sit down quietly and wait to be gobbeted like a trout . Oh , his intentions are good , I 'm sure . He thinks I 'll have no chance if I show fight . " He straightened up suddenly and gave his head a shake.  | " I give you the promise you demand . Now what does the marshal want you to tell me ? " Richard proceeded to enumerate the arguments which he had been given to show the danger of any resort to arms . He bore down particularlyon the folly of putting reliance in the promises of the French king . The prince heard him out with a serious mien , and then proceeded to argue the matter point by point . In doing so he showed an almost mature perception of the military aspects of the case and a surprisingly sound judgment of the main figures involved . He spoke , however , in jocular terms , as though the situation appeared to him in the nature of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His uncle was never referred to by the dignified name he bore nor even as the king ; he was always Jack Lack . The marshal was , as already shown , Dismal Will and sometimes Old I-Do-My-Duty . The King of France was the Big Promiser and the Red Cardinal was never anything but Foxy . His sister was , affectionately , Puss-in-Silks . The prince paced up and down the small apartment as he talked , with the springy step of perfectly co-ordinated muscles and a tendency to gesture with some flamboyance . It was clear from the beginning that he took an optimistic view of things . He was not , he said , aiming to take the throne of England from the perfidious uncle who had robbed him of it . The sole purpose of the present moves was to assure him the possession of Brittany and its allied provinces . Could there be any legitimate objection to his taking some at least of the lands which were rightly his ? He laughed easily when Richard repeated the words of the marshal , that he must beware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure in the minds of his associates and friends . He would be deemed a poor creature if he sat down and did nothing . He must stand up for his rights , he declared with flashing eyes , or forever after be counted a poltroon and a fainthearted cullion . " Enough of this , " he declared finally . " You have said your say . I have listened and weighed everything . No word you have uttered will go outside this room ; you have my word on that . And , of course , I expect you to be equally reticent . All I can tell you now is that I will give thought to the marshal 's message . " A wave of the hand brought the discussion to a close . The prince called , " Pierre ! " and , when a man-at-arms answered , he gave an order : " Tell them to send up wine . " Then he swung around to face Richard with a smile of the utmost friendliness . " You 'll have to leave at once . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no telling what he will do . He has a very bad habit of acting first and then explaining himself when it 's all over . I do n't want him hanging you and your man and then coming to me with trumpedupproofs that you were spying on us . " The wine arrived and the prince had a goblet poured for Richard . " When it 's all over and I 've shown Jack Lack that I ca n't be treated like a child , " he said , " you must come back . Ah , what good times we 'll have ! We 'll hunt old Oncle Verrat the wild boar , and we 'll splinter lances every day . I will be expecting you to teach me a great deal about that . And we 'll play Tables . Are you a good hand with the dice ? I am . I 'm the best in all Brittany . Everyone says so . " His eyes , as brilliantly blue as his sister 's , were shining . " I like you , Englishman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his party left at an early hour next morning . There was a hint of triumph back of the gray eyes of Tostig as they rode out to the southern highway . " She has agreed , " he said . " You refer , of course , to the little Giselle . But to what has she agreed ? " " Master Rick , she has a fondness for me and she has promised to wait for me to come back . How soon do you think that will be ? " " You are a lucky man , Tostig , " said Richard as they clattered noisily over the drawbridge . " But it will be several years before we can expect to come back . " " God grant that she will be alive and here to greet me , " said Tostig soberly . " The princess rides with her brother to Mirebeau and it is arrangedthat Giselle is the one to go with her . " Richard was startled beyond measure . " What folly is this ? " he cried . " Do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do n't they know that the King of France is so occupied in the Vexin that he wo n't be there to help them and that they 'll have to meet John and his army alone ? The princess may be killed or taken prisoner . This is sheer madness ! " " Giselle told me the real reason , " said Tostig . " The Princess Eleanor has no love for the old queen . She was to have been married to the Dauphin of France but the widow rode all the way to the court of Spain and brought back another grandchild , Blanche of Castile , to be-P163come the dauphine instead . Eleanor would have been a much better Queen of France than the plain Blanche . She wants a chance to charge the old lady with her unfairness and duplicity . " " Nothing but ill will come of it ! " cried Richard . They were climbing the road to Rennes and Tostig turned back for a last look . An expression of rare felicity crossed his face and he raised an arm above his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw a figure standing on the low battlements , violently agitating a red kerchief . It was clear even at the distance that it was Giselle . " Lucky Tostig , " he thought . But Tostig was not to have all the luck . For a brief space they had been aware that a small party was riding ahead of them , skirting the edge of the woods and stopping at intervals to study the sky . " Hawking , " commented Tostig . Richard nodded and threw back his head to look upward . At the moment there was nothing on wings within sight . " Three ladies with them , " said the squire , gazing ahead under a cupped hand . " Two of them seem to be attendants . The third one , in the pink cloak , is  --  I believe it 's the Princess Eleanor . " After a pause Richard said , " Yes , it 's the princess . " The lady in question was wearing a mantle over her head but her hair was not covered completely and there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind that he had other means of identifying her ; the way she carried her head , a characteristic manner of raising her arms . " Is it a peregrine on her wrist ? " asked Tostig . " It must be . No woman , not even a princess , is allowed to have a gerfalcon . " " They 're not having any luck . The bird is mantling . " The line of trees drew in closer to the road and the royal party came slowly within speaking distance . " Sir Knight , " said the clear , high voice of the princess , " you ride early . " Richard did not respond at once . She had addressed him in English ! There had been some talk in the Breton tongue during the two days-of their stay at the court but everyone with whom Richard had come in contact had spoken French . " My lady , I am much surprised , " he said . " I did not know you could speak our language . " " My mother was most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate care . " She never doubted my brother would someday be King of England . And so she said we must both speak English , even though our father had not a word of it . The English is  --  much difficult . I speak it , Sir Knight , most badly . " Richard could not restrain himself from smiling . " You speak it very well , Your Highness . There is a trace of an accent but I find it delight-ful . " " That is greatly kind . I speak it so little now . I knew you were leaving . My brother told me he had given advices to you to go without delay . He liked you , Sir Knight . " Richard bowed . " I am happy to know that His Highness approved of me . " Her manner had been somewhat aloof but at this point she seemed to relent . " Was it clear , " she asked , smiling , " that when you came I did not approve you very much ? " " Yes , Your Highness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to be sure no one was within hearing distance . " But when you won from that  --  that great beast , that giant with face of bird of prey , I began to regret with my princely brother that you would not stay . Where do you go ? " " First to Tours . I may ride then to Bordeaux but sooner or later , my lady , I shall go to Rome . " There was a moment of silence . " We hoped , " she said , " that you might  --  how is it said ?  --  cast your lot with us . Perhaps not now but later . " She had reined her mount in so closely that they could now speak without any risk of being overheard . Her party had drawn off on some concern of the sport and Richard 's men were keeping a discreet distance . He felt his heart pounding because of her nearness . On the other occasions when he had seen her , she had been in green or blue but the pink cloak she now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was less regal most certainly and more feminine , even , he thought , coquettish . The peregrine preened itself again , spreading out one wing and stretching a leg , as though in protest at this long interruption . The princess spoke to the bird in affectionate undertones . " Will you be returning to England soon ? " she asked then . " Not for years , my lady . I have my fortune to make , and small chance there is of that in England . " She made some adjustment of the chain which held the peregrinep165on her wrist and this kept her occupied for some moments . Then she looked up again . " Do not , I beg you , Sir Knight , put wrong construction on what I now say . There is no plotting to invade England . No such thought is in my brother 's head . But is it wrong to think that a kind and wise God may provide a chance someday for a great injustice to be  --  to be set right ? If this should happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " My sympathies , " declared Richard , lowering his voice , " have always been with Prince Arthur . " " It is possible then you might someday ride in his train . No , say nothing more . Words are dangerous things . What we have said must be locked as a secret between us . " The attendants of the princess drew closer as though they thought the conversation had been unduly long . Eleanor smiled and bowed , and then raised one hand in a gesture of farewell . The party returned to their sport . " I am lucky also , " said Richard to himself . " I have a memory which I shall cherish all my life . "  |p166RICHARD  OF RAWEN rode all over France and put in an appearancewherever a tournament was being held , once journeyingdown into Navarre and once venturing over into Genoa . His strength had increased and his skill had reached its high mark since hestretched the mighty Sire Tohu-Bohu on the turf . He emptied saddles wherever he went ; and every time he knocked an opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it being the rule that the gear of the loser was forfeited to the winner : his charger , his saddle , his armor , his supply of weapons , everything but his shield , which carried his armorial bearings . Sometimes the loser would buy back his equipment but generallythe winner found it necessary to visit some soft-spoken Lombard banker in an inconspicuous shop and sell his winnings for the best price he could negotiate . Richard emptied so many saddles and filled so many pockets with gold that in the course of a short time the money belt around his waist was stuffed with pieces of the precious yellow metal . He was being heralded as second only to the once great William the Marshal . Wherever they went they heard talk of the wickedness of the King of England . John was loudly cursed as a usurper , a perjurer , and a foul murderer . The frightening train of events which had followed close on the heels of Richard 's departure from Brittany was seldom out of the young knight 's mind . He and Tostig talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their faces would darken and their fists would clench and a desire for revenge would show in every word they said . Soon after their departure from the ducal palace near Rennes , Prince Arthur had collected his forces and marched against Mirebeau as planned . Although the garrison was taken by surprise , the castle had been defended stoutly under the fierce urging of the old queen , Eleanorp167of Aquitaine , whose dark eyes still burned in her wrinkled face with the same fire as in days gone by when she had been the most beautiful and most willful woman in Europe . They could not have held out indefinitely , of course , and the final stage was in sight when King John , rousing himself from his customary lethargy , had acted for once with proper dispatch . He arrived on the scene with a considerable force and shattered the Bretons under their brave but inexperienced young prince . Many prisoners were taken , including the prince himself , the Princess Eleanor , and all of the knights in arms . All Christendom had shuddered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and it was believed that the enraged monarch had murdered him . Twenty-four of the captured knights had been sent to England , bound together in pairs in open carts . Incarcerated in Corfe Castle , a gaunt stronghold in the Isle of Purbeck which John used as a political prison , they had been starved to death ; a method to which the amiable king seemed addicted . As to the fate of the princess , nothing was known . Was she still alive ? Had John placed her in one of his black prisons , not daring to outrage world opinion with an assassination even more unthinkable than that of the unfortunate Arthur ? The fate of the lovely Eleanor had seldom been out of Richard 's mind since . Tostig would always remember him at this stage as a silent figure with knuckles tense on the hilt of his dagger . Sometimes the knight would burst out into loud self-reproach . " What am I doing here ? " he would ask . " Playing at war and fattening my purse while this wild beast holds our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England where it may be possible to do something for her . I should at least be willing to aid her cause by clamoring against her infamous jailer ! " Tostig would answer with the sound common sense which never desertedhim . " We ca n't go back to England . The king knows what you have been doing , that you favored Arthur from the beginning . Do you want to give him the satisfaction of putting you in some foul prison to starve to death ? Would it serve the cause of the princess for you to die and for me to be hanged on the nearest gibbet ? " " It might set men to thinking . " " They are thinking , Master Rick . And if they think long enough , they may reach the point of acting . That is the time when we should be there . " Tostig felt as deeply apprehensive as Richard but he restrained himself from speaking openly on the subject . He knew the young knight was still convinced that his first duty was to serve his king and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been possible for the squire to see into Richard 's mind , he would have found there the beginnings of doubt . Richard Coeur de Lion had shaken his namesake 's faith in some degree . Despite the splendor of the warrior king 's exploits in the Holy Land , it had been hard to swallow his callous disregard of the interests of England , his eagerness to grasp by corrupt means the gold for his incessantfighting in France . And now the malevolence and the cowardiceof John had convinced the unhappily puzzled knight that allegiance to this particular incumbent of a throne was impossible . Richard in his bewilderment had even reached the stage of asking himself : " If one king can be so bad that tavern knaves spit at the mention of his name , is there something wrong with the system which puts all power in one pair of hands ? " He dismissed the suggestion quickly whenever it obtruded itself on his mind ; but it kept coming back . What was destined to be the last tournament in which Richard of Rawen played a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of Paris . It drew a large number of competitors and attracted spectators by the thousands . Six challengers , the cream of the Gallic stock , set up their gaudy pavilions at one end of the lists and a large canvas tent was raised at the other end for those who would come to face them . In spite of the reputation he had gained , Richard was among the latter . At a late hour of the morning , while the babble of thousands of tongues rose from the galleries outside and the brassy piping of the heralds could be heard every few minutes , Richard was putting on his armor in a corner of the common pavilion . He was in a confident mood because he had prevailed over four of the challengers in previous meetings and did not anticipate any difficulty with the other two . A mendicant friar in a black robe ( which indicated a certain lack of orthodoxy ) came into the pavilion on bare feet . As a man of peace , he found himself ill at ease in this atmosphere and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only and then dropping them hastily as though he shrank from what he saw . Finally his gaze became fixed on Tostig and , with considerable hesitation , he crossed the crowded space to address him . " Eenglish ? " he asked . Tostig straightened up and looked at him questioningly . " English ? Yes , I am English , Father . "  |p169The  friar hesitated still more noticeably over his next question . " Name , Tosty ? " " My name is Tostig . " The friar gave his head a satisfied nod . " The same . Tosty . From Eengland . I have message for Tosty . " Tostig drew the black-robed figure into the corner where their talk could not be overheard . " You have a message for me ? " " Oui , messire . Message . One who serves great lady bids Tosty know both she and mistress alive and well . Well as  --  as can be ? " Tostig grasped the friar by the arm . " What else ? There must be more . Where is she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sent this message and her mistress are in England . " The black robe nodded . " I think , yes . In Eengland . " " How , " demanded Tostig eagerly , " did you get this message ? " " It pass from one to one . I am eleven to have it . Now you have message . That is good . " The man in the black robe turned to leave the pavilion . " My son , give up violent ways . Turn feet to heavenly path . " " Thank you , Father , " said Tostig gratefully . He realized that the mendicant friar had taken a great risk in drawing attention to himself in this way . He and his like lived precariously under the stern disapprovalof the Church . Finding a coin in a pocket under his belt , Tostig held it out . " For the common purse . " The friar accepted the coin with a furtive caution and glided out from the pavilion . " Master Rick ! " exclaimed Tostig , returning to complete his task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friar told me ? The blessing of all the saints descend on his humble head ! They are alive and well . The princess and Giselle . The word was sent to us by Giselle , and has been passed along from one to another . " Richard had been on the point of settling his steel headpiece into place . He paused and regarded his squire over the rounded top of it . A light was beginning to kindle in his eye . " Did you question him ? Are you sure he speaks the truth ? " " I have no doubts on that score . The message has been passed on by word of mouth . That is all I know . But we can be certain now that they are alive , both the princess and Giselle . And they are as well as might be expected . What better news could we have ? " " None ! I have n't felt so happy since we learned they had fallen intop170the evil hands of John . Father in heaven , I thank Thee ! Thou halt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard was so delighted with the news that he went out to play his part in the lists in a highly exalted state of mind . Having small concern for anything else , he performed his tasks with nonchalant skill and sent three of the challengers sprawling on the pitted sod . This was all he was called upon to do and after that he needed only to acquit himself well in the melee , which would bring the contest to a close , in order to be acclaimed the champion of the day . A melee was a pleasant exhibition in which the knights took sides , thirty against thirty , and fought it out with lance , battle-ax , and sword until the judges decided there had been enough bloodshed . But when , late in the afternoon , Richard issued forth for his last appearance and swung himself up into the saddle , himself on the elevated ground back of the common pavilion and had drawn most of the spectators from their seats in the wooden galleries . A dense circle had already been formed about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dedicated fire had taken possession of his angular countenance . " Who is that ? " asked Richard . Tostig was holding Messire by the bridle . " I suspect it 's a priest preaching the new crusade . " Richard listened to the persuasive voice of the priest and then slipped down from his saddle . " Tostig , " he said , " I think we should listen to what this man has to tell us . " The tournament came to a complete stop , for everyone , even the highborn ladies from the gallery , which was called the Bower of Beauty , had left their seats and ranged themselves around the impassioned priest . His face was as full of light as a beacon fire , his voice as resonant as the trumpet of a herald . He depicted the evil days which had fallen on the Holy City , which the Saracens again held , in the most vivid terms . The Holy Sepulchre was befouled , the Temple of Solomon resoundedwith the shrill voices of infidels , Moslem inciters to violence had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did the Christianworld sit slothfully by ? It was time to draw the sword again ! " It 's said he 's a servant of the young Pope , " whispered Tostig . Richard did not hear him . He was listening with such close attention that he was unconscious of everything save the voice of the eloquent priest . His thoughts were following the preacher a long distance intop171the East , to the ground where the Temple of Solomon had once stood , high above the Valley of the Cheesemakers , to the humble home in the Wall of David , to the Mount of Olives where the treetops stirred gently when a breeze was wafted down from the scarred face of Jebel Kuruntul and where , it was still believed , a devout eye might find the imprint of a sacred foot . It was when the speaker turned to the defaming of the holy places that his eloquence reached its peak . He made them see the narrow streets , close and dark and dangerous , doubly dangerous now that infidelslurked in every twist and turn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reserved for the chaffering and bickering of desert traders who called on the name of Allah . Men knelt on the Dome of the Rock and prayed to a God who was not the God of Israel . More disturbing still , because it could be more easily shared , was the picture drawn of the plight of the pilgrims who took their sins to Jerusalem : cheated , scoffed at , pelted with dung , seized with sudden furious hate ( if any strayed away from their fellows ) and sold into slavery to infidel masters , maltreated for all the days of their lives , no more than one in six getting home to tell their story and wear in their hats thereafter the silver sprig of the palmer . What , 0 men of good faith and stout heart , was to be done about this ? At the finish Richard was one of the many who stepped forward and professed a willingness to serve . When the ceremony was over , he looked at the cross he wore on the breast of his tunic and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time now . " " No , " was the answer . " Perhaps our pleas will reach the ears of the Lord more surely this way . " Richard turned and looked at his companion . His eyes displayed a sudden surprise and he pointed at Tostig with an accusing finger . " You are not wearing the cross ! I was too absorbed to notice . But I thought  --  I was sure  --  you had taken the oath also . " " No , " said Tostig , " I did n't take the oath . I tried to reason you out of it but I do n't think you heard anything I said . You seemed in a trance . Do n't look at me so accusingly ! I have n't committed any offense against God and Holy Church . I have made use of such common sense as I happen to have . " Richard was frowning in a perplexed way . " Common sense has nothing to do with it . " " I 'm afraid it has . I do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you have , it is doubly necessary for me to be free . I think I understand the situation in the world today better than you do . " Richard 's perplexity was growing by the minute . Never had Tostig spoken to him like this before . " We 've been hearing a great deal about the young Pope , " declared Tostig . " How strong he proved himself in Italy when he chased the Germans out . How much he has the interests of suffering humanity at heart when he builds these great hospitals of the Holy Ghost . How wise and strong he was in sending an army to capture Constantinople and so unite Eastern Christians with the West under one Pope . Everyone has told us he has a greatness in him which the others lacked , those venerable ones who 've been sitting in the Lateran . But there 's something I know which you may not , Master Rick : that the young Pope was deceived and cheated . He did n't want the crusading army to go against Constantinople . He knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture Egypt . But the men of Venice , who think of nothing but money and trade , were expected to supply the ships and those sharp foxes held back until they were allowed control ; and they chose to tear down the power of the Eastern emperors instead . It looks at the moment as though they won a victory but all they succeeded in doing was to defeat the plans of the young Pope for a successful crusade . " " How does it happen , " demanded Richard , " that you know so much more than anyone else about such matters ? " " Master Rick , " said Tostig earnestly , " you 've laughed at me because I like to talk to all kinds of people . Well , I enjoy sitting down with them and listening to what they have to say . You 'll laugh at me again when I tell you the common man keeps his ears open and hears many things which escape his betters . A keeper of an inn very often has a shrewder view of affairs than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest . The news that comes out of Constantinople is n't good . That great monster of a city has a habit of swallowing those who try to conquer it . Do you know that London town could be dropped in one corner of it and never be noticed again ? Well , it wo n't be long before the Eastern Empire will be back where it was before  --  free of the West , free of Rome , and free of the Pope . And all the crusading zeal of the young Pope will have been expended in vain . He knows it , never fear ; and that is why he is striving so hard to get another crusade under way . He wants another army and another chance to carry out thep173original plan . That 's why he has sent out these priests to rouse the world . " " Is that why you stood aside ? " asked Richard . " So you could go back at once to England ? " " Though I wo n't be wearing the cross , " declared Tostig , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely you know that . " A sense of contrition took possession of Richard . " Forgive me , Tostig , for what I said . I did n't mean it . I know how loyal you have always been . " " Well , " declared the squire , " this is the position we are in . We ca n't stand around waiting for marching orders from the Pope . It may be years before he 's in a position to give them . Our best plan will be to ride at once to Marseilles and take a pilgrimage ship to Rome . " " To see the Pope ? " Richard clearly was elated at the prospect of this . " Perhaps , " was the answer . " But to see another man first . An Englishman . A very great man , the greatest Englishman alive today . He stands so high in the esteem of men that I beard much talk of him here last night when I had my glass of wine in the common room at the inn . His name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of him . " " Where you sit the talk is all of war and fighting and doing brave deeds . But even the beggars of Paris know of Stephen Langton . They say he will be the next Pope , if he outlives Innocent . The young Pope knew him when they were studying in Paris . One of the first things Innocent did when he was elected was to summon Stephen Langton to Rome . He made him a cardinal and he asks advice of him more than of any other man . My idea is this , Master Rick : that we go to see Stephen Langton and ask his counsel . Whatever he tells us to do will be wise and right . " " When do you propose to start ? " " Now . I think we should be on our way before the sun goes down . It 's a long ride to Marseilles . " Richard indulged in a somewhat rueful laugh . " Am I not to have time to collect my winnings ? The gear of those three knights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although I have n't much stomach for bargaining at the moment . " " Let me talk to them , " suggested Tostig . " I wo n't let them off easily . You may be sure of that . "  |p174Tostig  looked with a grimace of distaste at the slattern ship tied up in Marseilles Harbor . " They build them for the pilgrimage trade , " he said . " They 're good only for hugging the shores . Sometimes they buy old ships of war and then remove the cabins to make more space for passengerson the decks . " The master of the ship in question was a huge fellow named Cornelius . He had a tangled mop of hair , scowling features , and no more than a part mouthful of teeth . His naked belly could not be spanned by an ordinary pair of arms . He came from somewhere in the Baltic area but he addressed them in a vulgar mangling of the French tongue . " You will pay double for the horses , " he said . " They will he stabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them yourselves . " " Your terms are hard , " said Tostig . " Then do n't take ' em ! " cried the master in an angry voice . " I can sell every inch of space I have . I have no stomach for gentrice , if you want the truth , my masters . They demand too much . They want hot food . They want cabins and they light candles and they set the curtains afire . Many a ship has been lost because of them . I want none of these highnosedlords . Give me a deckful of humble fellows who do n't squirm at maggots in the bread and take a kick in the backsides in good part . " He interrupted this harangue to roar at an assistant . " What 's this you 're bringing out , you miserable , sniveling codshead ? " " It 's the wine , " mumbled the man . " T ' cure the seasickness . " " My fine malvoisiel " bellowed the master . " Look at the sea , you blind ox ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no seasickness today . Take the wine back . " Then he turned again to the Englishmen . " There wo n't be another ship for two weeks . But do n't let that change your minds . I will be glad to see the last of you . " " We have no choice , " said Richard . He shuddered when he followed the horses to the orlop deck . Bilge water churned through the foul sand at every movement of the ship . The offal from many voyages had not been removed and the stench was indescribable . " When they have a corpse to be buried ashore , they give it temporary burial in the sand here , " said Tostig , who knew a great deal about everything . " Sometimes , they say , you can see arms and hands , and even heads , sticking up before the end of a voyage . " They tethered Messire at one end and supplied him abundantly withp175hay . Richard ran a sympathetic hand down the charger 's muzzle . " My poor fellow ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse like you , a horse of high degree , to be penned up in a pesthole like this . " Let 's pray for a short run , " he remarked as they came up on deck . They found that conditions there were almost as bad . The deck was already filled with men of all sizes , shapes , and nationalities . They wore the gray cowl , scrip , and scarf , and the slouch hats turned up in front , which marked them as pilgrims . Most of them had breviaries at their belts and all carried staffs . Cattle and sheep were penned at each end and chickens were roosting everywhere . " Where will we sleep ? " asked Richard . " We 'll sleep on the deck and we wo n't have more than an inch of space from our neighbors . Cheek by jowl . St. Christopher , watch us with a kindly eye ! " Tostig studied the horizon and gave his head a shake . " We 're going to have weather by nightfall . This tub will pitch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time the prayer to St. Julien brought the evening services to an end , and the pilgrims were stretched out on the six feet by two of space to which they were entitled , the deck was pitching drunkenly and most of the passengers were already sick . It took twelve full days to circle the Tyrrhenian Sea on the way to Rome and by that time the unfortunate pilgrims were sadly emaciated . Master Cornelius , who seemed impervious to the weather , stamped about and cursed his luck at having to feed them so much longer than he had expected . He was , in point of fact , lucky ; for the pilgrims were too ill to eat the nauseous food and they learned early it was no use begging for wine . There were deaths every day and the bodies were piled together under canvas and buried in the sea after night had fallen . Richard slept between Tostig on one side and a burly Swede on the other . A hen insisted on roosting on his shoulder . He would shoo it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back . Sometimes , as though by way of payment , he would find an egg on the deck beside him and would scramble bitterly with the Swede for it . On the last occasion that this happened he conceded the egg to his neighbor without a struggle because it was evident that the once strong Scandinavianwas a very sick man . On the last night , when they had spied the rooftops of Ostia by the final feeble rays of the sun ( to the dazed men everything seemed gray and sickly ) , the Swede , who had not moved for hours , finally succumbedand his body was hauled away . A greasy Levantine took hisp176place with an eagerness which should have aroused some apprehension ; but both Richard and Tostig were too enfeebled to give the newcomer a thought . They settled down heavily to get as much sleep as possible before the disembarkation in the morning . Richard wakened to a bright and waaiu sky overhead , a steady deck , and a view of the shore which was unbelievably inviting . The Levantine was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expectation of comforts ashore . His satisfaction , however , was shortlived . A lack of constriction about his waist caused him to drop a questinghand to that area . " Tostig ! " he cried . " I 've been robbed ! My belt is gone ! " Tostig 's response was fraught with at least an equal degree of dismay and anger . He found that his belt had also been removed during the night . One of the other pilgrims sat up and said that the Levantine was a thief and had been suspected of other robberies during the course of the voyage . " If you had money in those belts , you should have slept with your hands under them , " he volunteered . They ran up and down the deck , looking for the missing passenger , but saw no trace of him . Master Cornelius , when they invaded the quarterdeck with their frantic complaints , supplied the explanation to the disappearance of the nimble-fingered Levantine . " He 's gone , " he said . " Did a neat cat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore boat around dawn . They 've landed by this time . " The masterseemed not at all disturbed over their loss . In fact there was a hint in his eye of secret pleasure . " I knew him for a nip as soon as he come aboard . You 'll have this much satisfaction : he 'll be becked and hanged one of these days . " Richard was white of face and sick inside over the loss of all his winningsof nearly three years but the effect on Tostig was even more noticeable . He was white with consternation and anger . " If you knew him for a cutpurse , why did n't you warn us ? " he demanded of the master . Cornelius exploded into one of his familiar rages . " Why did n't I warn you ? " he thundered . " Did n't he wear his cloak and his hat and his staff ? Did n't he even have the bell at his belt , and how many of them do ? Did n't he pay in his money , with an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside those slangy shirts they wear ? Let me tell you this , Master Squire : we have them on every run , these users of the cant . This fellow now , the one who 's got your money and is burning his soles to get away , P177he 's riding on pilgrim ships all the time . Is it concern of mine ? There are plenty of them , playing low and crafty . On my last turn I carried three ladies . In disguise as pilgrims , mind you . Two were running away from their husbands , the sluts . The third  --  well , she , the slyboots , was n't up to anything good . " He allowed his voice to recede several degrees to a more normal pitch . " There , Master Squire , that 's what we have to face , and who am I to do anything about it ? " This contradictory tirade left Tostig in an angrier mood than before . " What you mean is that the forces of evil congregate to rob and pillage the pilgrims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but wo n't do anything about it . " " That , my loud-crowing cockerel , " said Master Cornelius , turning and walking away from them , " is what I mean . " That was how it came about that , when they went ashore , their waists were still free of the satisfying encirclement of their money belts , and in their pockets they had no more than a few small pieces of silver . It was in the church of St. Chrysogonus , which stood in the sparsely settled part of Rome on the far bank of the river Tiber , that the two weary travelers first saw Stephen Langton . He was preaching , and the church was filled to overflowing ; a well-dressed congregation for the most part , and eagerly attentive . The voice of the English cardinal filled the edifice without difficulty . The pen of a narrator , which may plunge blithely into descriptions of lesser men , pauses when it becomes necessary to depict a Stephen Langton . He was not tall nor were his features conspicuous in any marked way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ index to his character , for at most times they were thoughtful and reserved ; and it was only when his tongue took fire that their cool gray turned a deeper shade and they held the watcher in complete subjection . It was when he spoke that the measure of the man could best be had ; his voice was deep and unhurried and compelling , and what he had to say , no matter how difficultor how simple the theme , seemed lucid and convincing . Richard 's eyes wandered a little as the sermon progressed , taking in the handsome velvets and looped gold chains of the sallow-faced men and the dark beauty of the women but Tostig never took his gaze from the speaker . At the conclusion he whispered to his companion , " This is the man needed in England , Master Rick . "  |p178Ste|phen  Langton received them later in an austere stone room off the atrium . He looked tired , as though the delivery of the sermon had drawn on his strength . " I am happy to welcome fellow countrymen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting the lithe lines of his tall frame and the hint of great strength . " So you are Richard of Rawen . I am a man of peace but I confess that pride caused a tingling in my veins when I heard you had overthrown the Goliath of the West , and at word of your many victories since . You are wearing the cross ! I am happy to see it , and I am sure His Holiness will count it an example which will bring us many recruits . " He studied them both for a brief moment . " There is a reason , no doubt , for your visit to Rome at this point . " Richard looked rather shamefaced as he replied . " Our purpose in coming was for inspiration and guidance . There is an immediate need , however ; for a bed tonight and , perhaps , a meal . " The broad brow of the churchman drew into a puzzled frown . " I am sure there is a story behind this . " He listened to the tale of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will not be new to you , then , " he said at the conclusion , " that there is a conspiracy to rob the men who take the staff of the pilgrim and set out to see the Holy Land with their own eyes . It is not confined to low criminals of the stripe of this man who robbed you . It extends as high as governors of provinces and even to  --  to leaders of the Church . The pilgrimage ships pay huge profits . But the worst thing of all is the way these poor brave fellows suffer when they reach the Holy Land . They are robbed and mistreated , they are sold spurious relics , they are even sold into slavery . The money filched from them every year runs to fabulous amounts . " After several moments of unhappythought the cardinal seemed to brush the evil picture aside . " It is well you came here , my sons . His Holiness has need of men such as you . I shall make it my concern to take you before him at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of my household . It is a humble one . Peter 's pence does not suffice to maintain the offices needed about the papacy and we are always pressed for funds . But I can give you beds and seats at my table until such time as His Holiness decides the use he may make of you . " " You are most kind , my lord cardinal . " The churchman sighed as he sat behind the plain desk where he didhis daily work . " Have you been in England since John became king ? " " No , my lord . I have made no secret of my feeling about his choicep179over the unfortunate Prince Arthur ; and of what has happened since . It would not be safe for us to return . " The churchman paused briefly . " These are bad days in England , my sons . " They were summoned to an audience with the Pope the following morning at an hour which would have been surprising to anyone who did not know the habits of the young occupant of the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roofs of the Lateran Palace as they crossed the river but there were few signs of life in the streets . Most of Rome still slept . They passed through a succession of long high halls into which little light penetrated and through which sounds carried reluctantly , althoughthe smallest of them created slow and mysterious echoes . Two of the Ostiarii stood with pikes at each door and there was a continuous rustle of alb and stole and chasuble as the clerical staff moved with studious calm about their duties . An anteroom was reached finally where a young officer of the Ostiarii was on hand to receive them . He wore his silken cloak and carried his baton and he was so very young that it was doubtful whether his chin had yet known the touch of a razor . His manner was jaunty and he did not seem to have relished the need of rising so early . At any rate he was yawning openly . " I am Ralph of Mincamo , " he stated . " Welcome , my good fellow Norman . You are from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us half Norman , as a point of fact . Which is good . The Norman character , as I see it , benefits always from some form of blood mitigation . Eh , my friend ? " " My father was English , " said Richard . " I am proud of it . " The officer continued to talk with an easy garrulity but in a low tone of voice . " You are going to be with us . You may not know it yet but I assure you it is all settled . We will serve together , I trust , but there will be this difference between us : you will owe your appointment to merit and accomplishments in the field , I owe mine to family influence pure and simple . I have done nothing to earn a post of any kind . I am like the lilies of the field ; at least , I toil not . And why should I ? An uncle of mine is an archbishop and there are three counts in the family , and much wealth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while this chatterbag talks to me ? "  |p180The  young man from Sicily must have sensed what was passing through his mind , for he said : " He 's not ready for you yet . There have been matters to disturb him already and I suspect he 's reaching for the thunderbolts in there . Still , he wo n't be hard on you because you come from the Silent One . Anyone who comes from the Silent One is greeted with attention and even respect . " Richard asked in a puzzled tone , " Do you refer to Cardinal Langton ? " " Yes , the new cardinal , " answered Ralph of Mincamo easily . " He 's English too , Langton . When the tension gets to a point here , we sigh with relief when we hear the Silent One has arrived . He has a way with him . A way of seeing the best thing to be done under any and all circumstances . " The young officer raised a hand which boasted a handsomeoriental ring , with a stone gleaming like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please , my good fellow Norman , do not misunderstand me . I mean no lack of respect . I have the greatest admiration for the one who sits inside . He is going to be a great Pope . " " I heard that said of him on my travels , " stated Richard . Ralph of Mincamo nodded . " If he lives long enough , he 's going to be the greatest Pope of all time . He will rule Christendom from in there if he gets his way . And it 's my opinion , Sir Giant-Killer , that he will get his way . " There was still no word from the inner room . The officer took advantage of the delay to speak further about the young Pope . " He 's admired by everyone here ; and that is unusual because some of the staff have served under a half dozen or more Popes and can compare them . There 's one man , in the Archives , who can remember back as far as Adrian IV , nearly fifty years . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adrian , who was a very strong Pope . The Lion of the North , they called him . " " I seem to have heard something about him . " " You should , Sir Englishman . He came from England . Nicholas Breakspear was his name . The only Englishman to reach the exalted post ; putting aside all that silly nonsense about a Pope Joan . And he 'll be the last , in my opinion . Unless the chance comes to the Silent One , which is highly unlikely . " Everything that the loquacious officer had said served to make Richardincreasingly doubtful of the result of his audience . How could he hope to make a good impression on a man as great and difficult as this ? He said something to this effect but Ralph of Mincamo brushed it aside airily.  | " You wo n't need to talk . He wo n't even ask you any questions . It 's a rule of his to know in advance everything he needs to know about a man . I promise you he has your pedigree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inner room and said , " Richard of Rawen ! " Richard stepped forward and bowed . " Come with me . His Holiness is ready to receive you . Your squire is expected also . " " Good luck , my new friend , " whispered Ralph of Mincamo . " Stand up straight and have little to say . And do n't get in the way of any thunderbolts . " The room where the Pope sat was in sharp contrast to the loftiness and grandeur of the halls and reception apartments . It was plain with sober walls and a large outer door which opened directly to the east , through which he could gaze and ponder on the problem which sat so heavily on all pontifical shoulders : the freeing of the Holy City ; not that Innocent ever took much time to gaze or ponder , his waking moments being given over to endless work . It was a busy place , with two secretariesat corner desks , scratching away with pens , and the walls covered with plans and maps . The plans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East , and it was to be seen at first glance that they were far different from the usual kind . The map makers of the day were indifferentperformers , with no exact knowledge of topography and a tendency to let imagination fill in where detail was lacking . It may have been that the plans which Innocent kept about him were the work of oriental hands , the men of the East being far superior to their Western brothers ; they were excellent , at any rate , with precision taking the place of allegoricalflourish . Nothing they had heard of this extraordinary man had prepared them for what they found . The face of the pontiff did not suggest his relatively few years . It was lined and seamed already , and the sunken cheeks and intensely alive eyes suggested that his soaring spirit made too heavy demands on a frail body . The eyes were deep-set and magnetic . The two Englishmen , on comparing notes later , realized that they had been captured by the first glance he turned upon them . " Richard of Rawen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other , " and you also , my son . I have good reports on both of you . I have a fondness for Englishmen . Once , when I was very young , I paid your country a visit , to pray at the shrine of St. Thomas the Martyr . I can still feel the intense emotion which took possession of me when I - gazed at the spot which had been washed with his blood . " After ap182moment 's reflection devoted to that early experience , he went on : " Your country impressed me as a land of milk and honey and my desire was to return often . That privilege will now be withheld from me . " The pontiff concluded a close study of both visitors and then straightenedup in his chair . " It is gratifying , " he said , " to see the cross worn by so doughty a champion . It is my hope that you will remain here , my son , until such time as we are ready to strike a blow . There is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command , Holy Father . " " I can not promise you any substantial reward , my son . A living has become vacant in one of your northern shires and I shall so arrange matters that a portion of the income will be set aside for you . It will be a circuitous arrangement , and one extremely vexatious to me . The appointment will go to a clerical member of my household , who will retain a purely nominal share . Part will then have to be paid to a native-born vicar who will perform the functions of the office . The balance , such as it is , will be yours . " His voice carried a slight note of apology . " It will be small . No more than enough to meet your most pressing needs . That is all . " " I ask for nothing better , Holy Father . " The passionate eyes of the young pontiff began to burn under the penthouse of his brows . " This will be the three hundred and twentyfourthappointment of this kind in England alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute thus to our ever increasing costs . But I repeat for your benefit what I have said many times , that it is humiliating to depend on such devices and to be under the continual necessity of breaking down the opposition of the national churches . " He brushed away the papers in front of him with an impatient hand . " It is to be hoped that soon we shall agree on a better method . In the meantime it continues necessary to implement our funds in this way . " As for you , my son , " went on the pontiff , turning to Tostig , " I have the best advices as to your capacity and your character . I trust it will be agreeable to both of you if I make use of your time for work which will take you to other countries . The nature of this work will be explainedlater . There is a need for secrecy about it . Do you have any knowledge of Latin ? " " No , Your Holiness . " " Are you able to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , Your Holiness . " " My advices are that you are quick in acquiring the use of otherp183tongues . " This was quite true . Tostig spoke French more easily and fluently than Richard , who learned slowly . " It may be necessary to gain a slight grounding in one other tongue before you venture on your chief mission . " He reached out with a sudden briskness of manner for the papers on the desk . " That is all , my sons . " Rooms were allotted to Richard in one of the smaller buildings in the vicinity of the great state banqueting hall , which was called Triclinium Major . A short hall led off one of the main corridors , ending in an ascending flight of six stone steps . The door at the top was of massive oak and gave admission to his small suite . The rooms , three in number , had some advantages , however , the chief being the chance they offered him to see back over the walls and study at his ease the great city where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menservants , a valet and a cook . On the whole he was more comfortable than he had ever been before in his life . As the ceilings were high and the walls were of thick stone , he did not suffer too much from the summer heat ( but , ah , how cold they were to prove in winter ! ) and he had a large and stately bed which he did not need to share with anyone . The valet was a devoted little pod of a man and worked long hours for small pay . The cook was an accomplished rascal who spoke Latin fluently but who robbed him over the food bills . His work was not exacting . He stood in the anteroom of the Pope whenever prominent visitors were expected , and sometimes he would be called in to take part in any discussion which dealt with the possibility of another crusade . The men he came into contact with in this way were familiar with his exploits in the lists ; and so he was greeted with respect and his opinions , when sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these occasions was done by the Pope . He was still heart and soul in favor of a new and vigorous blow in the East . His eyes would glow with passion , his tongue would become eloquent as he depicted the need for immediate action . The visitors would go away convinced , and many of them would make promises of personal participation.  |p184ON  A MORNING in late summer , when the air was soft and warm and the orchards were full of color , Richard , having nothing better to do at the moment , set out on a tour of the gardens . " I wonder , " he thought , " if my lady is allowed to enjoy such beauty as this ? " He sighed when he reached the neighborhood of the gate , for here the monastery raised its gloomy roof high above the walls , with such a hint of seclusion about it that he was reminded of the rumor that the Princess Eleanor was being held behind the dark walls of a political prison . He found that three of the Ostiarii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance of a party of perhaps half a dozen dusty travelers . He gave an interested glance at the invaders , for there was something about them which seemed faintly familiar ; perhaps it was the shape and color of their faces , perhaps the sound of their voices . In the forefront was a priest who waddled and shook , partly with indignation , partly because of his excessive avoirdupois . He had a round face and a nose which resembled a button on the red biretta of a cardinal , and he moved with an air of comic self-importance . With angry gestures of his pudgy hands he was demanding in a high-pitched voice that he and his party be admitted at once . Losing interest in the visitors , Richard turned onto one of the paths leading back into the gardens . He stopped , however , when he heard a member of the party address the leader in English . A second spoke up . English again . " Sir Priest , " said Richard , approaching close to the group and addressingthe leader , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ? "  |p185The  leader turned at once in his direction . " Well may you ask , my son , " he stated , drawing himself up to his full height , which , it must be said , was far indeed from impressive . " I am Reginald of Canterbury . I seek audience of His Holiness , having just reached the city and daring not to delay by as much as an hour to get the papers and permissions demanded by these minions . " Reginald of Canterbury ! Richard turned the phrase over in his mind with a growing sense of perplexity . The Archbishop of Canterbury was Hubert Walter , who at one time had been King Richard 's justiciar . By what right did this shrill little clown assume such a designation ? Feeling unable to cope with the situation , he stated that by a happy chance Cardinal Langton was a visitor in the Basilica . With their permissionhe would inform the cardinal of their arrival , and , no doubt the permission necessary for their entrance would be forthcoming at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majestically and seemed prepared to lodge an objection on the point of delay . But Richard was already on his way . He found the English cardinal and informed him of what had happened . Stephen Langton seemed very much disturbed . " He has been expected , " he said . " A sorry tangle , this ! What a web to be woven by a parcel of stupid monks ! My son , " addressing Richard , " Hubert of Canterbury died some weeks ago . A group of the monks of Christ Church took it on themselves to elect their subprior to the vacant post . None other than Master Reginald who now demands admission at the gate . Word of his coming reached us two days ago . " Duty summoned Richard elsewhere and it was not until late in the afternoon that he again had a free moment . He sought out Tostig , who had just returned from one of his long journeys to Constantinople , where he had gathered information . The latter did not disappoint him ; he seemed to know the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , " he said . " His Holiness saw Master Reginald . It seems that at first the little man strutted and puffed out his chest . But at the finish he was on his knees , blubbering and mumblingexplanations , his little nose as red as a ripe cherry . " " Who is this Master Reginald ? " " One of the stupidest men in all England , " declared Tostig . " A rancid little puffin , filled to the ears with conceit of himself . It has long been a matter of tradition that the right to elect archbishops has rested with the monks of Christ Church but old Harry Secund put an end top186that . He told the monks they could elect anyone they saw fit , provided it was the candidate he wanted . " Well , " went on Tostig , " the younger monks at Canterbury got it into their heads that this was all wrong . They were going to assert their ancient right at the first opportunity . When Hubert Walter died , they rose secretly at midnight  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the younger spirits  --  and they hied themselves to the chapter house and proceeded to an election . This fat little donkey of a Reginald was their immediate superior . He was a notorious gabbler , a true jolthead , but these young dictators of destiny lacked the vision to see beyond him . So they chose Reginald . They recruited a party to accompany him , they raised the necessary funds and packed him off to Rome to secure confirmation at the hands of the Pope . One measure of caution occurred to them . The utmost secrecy must be maintained . The good Reginald was already beginning to puff and wheeze with importance but he agreed not to give anything out until he knelt in the presence of the vicar of Christ . Reginald 's pride was not equal to this severe test . He began to announce himself as soon as he set foot on Norman soil . The result was that the word got back quickly to England . " King John fell into a rage . He had his own candidate in mind , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole chapter before him , dictated to them the selection of the bishop , and then sent a deputation off for Rome for confirmation . A party of twelve , all of them thoroughly well bullied into doing what the king wanted . They left under strict orders to ride night and day and so reach Rome before Reginald , who was reported to be dawdling along like an old woman carrying eggs to the market . " Two mornings later , at an early hour , Richard lay in his wide and handsome bed and gazed out across the roofs of the great city . He was thinking of the days of Rome 's glory , when the legions marched out to conquer the world with the golden eagles flying proudly above them , of Caesar and Pompey and Scipio Africanus and the gallant Gracchi . As he pondered such matters he heard a footfall on the stone steps which led to his apartments . A firm stride , unmistakably that of Tostig . " They 've arrived , " announced the visitor , coming in with a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud and dust . They tumbled out of their saddles like so many bags of meal . Word of their arrival , and of the condition they were in , was taken to His Holiness , who ordered them to bed immediately with permission to sleep the clockp187around before seeing him . " " Tostig gave his head a brisk nod . " I was up and about and I saw them come ambling through the gate on their weary horses . A saddle-galled lot and yet in spite of the ache in their bones there was a certain smugness about them . They have come to selectthe new archbishop under the watching eyes of the Pope of Rome . No wonder they wore grins like cats stuffed with cream . But , " he added , " I fell into talk with one of the servants accompanying the party . He was a windy fellow and he told me that , although the monks will pretendthey can make the selection of their own free will , the king made each of them swear before they left not to vote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still think the Pope can circumvent them ? " asked Richard . " I think he will . Innocent will find some way . He 'll have his plans made before the weary crew wake up . Make no mistake , the new archbishop will be of his choosing . " Pope Innocent differed from most of the pontiffs who had preceded him in more ways than the question of his years . He was unconventionaland did not resort as much to the traditional ceremonies ; particularlythe slow and stately processionals about the Lateran in his chair . He was not only stirring up the whole of Christendom with his mighty plans , every detail of which he worked out himself , but he was striving to make Rome the final court of appeal in legal disputes . He presided tirelessly in the pontifical courts . There was little time in such an active life for the endless ceremonies which had made up so much of the lives of many of his predecessors . Often he traversed the halls of the palace on his own determined feet and the officers closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Innocent wasted no time in settling the dispute over the English archbishopric . He summoned all the parties concerned to appear before him . They were brought into one of the halls of justice where the pontiff sat on a high raised chair and the resident cardinals occupied seats below . The Pope did not pause to meditate for any length of time on the evidence . He straightened up and declared in firm tones that the electionof Reginald had been illegal from every standpoint and was thereforevoid . The hearing on the second election , that of John de Grey , by thep188whole chapter under the lowering gaze of the king , took a longer time . The discussion was opened by the Pope calling upon Stephen Langton for an opinion . The English cardinal had taken no part in the proceedings up to this point but the delegates from England had been fully aware of him as he sat quietly among his fellow cardinals . Although none of them had ever seen him , he had been a legendary figure in England for more than a decade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . " Your Holiness , " he said , " I have not been advised of all the circumstances of the case . Moreover , I am conscious that it has been many years since I set foot on English soil . There is not so much as a drop of alien blood in my veins , yet I do not believe that today I can appreciatefully what is happening in that green isle of my memory . Murmurs reach us from across the water . The people are stirring under the heavy hand of tyranny . The sound rises high , then ebbs , like the beat of storm waves on a fretted shore . It is clear , Your Highness , that there has been a change in the thinking of Englishmen . " This is a matter of the utmost importance ; for the man who is sent to the great See of Canterbury at this juncture must be a leader . He must be clear-sighted and he must be capable of sifting out on the granary floor of opinion that which is good and rejecting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have no acquaintance with the man John de Grey . I have heard nothing of praise for him , nor anything harsh or derogatory . That the king favors him is clear enough , and so it may be assumed that he would be an able administrator . The quarrel of parish against parish , the dissensions always found in high places  --  with these he would have a sure hand . I am confident he would fill a niche comfortably at the king 's court , with the apt words always to bless a kingly endeavor and the unction to smooth ruffled royal feathers . " But , Your Holiness , I can not judge if the man John de Grey has eyes to see what must be seen . How can we judge of him as a leader ? The head of the Church must be zealous in the fight which is beginning for the rights of the individual . Would he be strong enough to resist tyranny ? Would he be prepared to receive on an unbowed head the full fury of monarchial wrath ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend the session of the court . From their station well back toward the high mosaic wall , they had watched the proceedings with an almostp189breathless interest . While Stephen Langton spoke , they sat motionless , letting his words fill their hearts as well as their minds . " Surely , " whispered Richard , " they must all see that this is the man who should be chosen archbishop ! Do you suppose , Tostig , that the Pope has thought of him ? " Tostig laughed confidently . " The young Pope thinks of everything . Of course he has considered Langton for the post . Why else would he call upon him first ? He wants the delegates to see the light for themselves . Look at them ! They are drinking in every word . " Tostig was right . The Pope had thought of Stephen Langton for the post . He had not , as it soon developed , thought of anyone else . Much as he valued the work that Langton was doing in Rome , he realized how much more he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take sufficient care to assess in his mind what Langton was saying or , at any rate , to follow his reasoning through . Had he done so , he might have had a prophetic vision of what would come from this inspired type of leadership . He might have caught a fleeting vision of a broad green field on a bright summer day , where armed men bestrode their chargers and a pavilion stood in the midst of them and a king sat in futile efforts to avert the storm he had sown . Innocent III was too deeply committed to the elevation of the temporal power of the Church to feel too much concern for the needs of the common man . And so , years later , when Langton had achieved the first step in what he preached , they would cease to see eye to eye and the balance of their lives would be lived out in constant friction and suspicion . But that was all in the future . On this particular and momentous day , the young Pope saw in Stephen Langton the inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of satisfaction the faces of the delegates as the English cardinal spoke . When the end was reached and a silence fell over the hall , the Pope proceeded to strengthen the fabric of reasoning thus set up with the nails of legal ingenuity . " It becomes necessary now , " he declared , " to consider that the election of the Bishop of Norwich occurred before the previous election , that of Reginald , had been set aside . It is on that account as uncanonical as the first choice and must be declared void as well . With the ground thus cleared , we may now proceed to a legal and binding settlement . " This ingenious statement had not been expected . Blank looks were exchanged among the king 's delegates , who had been confident up to this point of an easy victory.  |p190The  pontiff did not pause for any discussion of the principle thus laid down . He followed his first blow with one of an even more sweeping nature . " It has come to our ears , " he declared , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been led to believe . It is true that they have already , in sessions at Canterbury , voted for John de Grey . It is known also that the King of England has promised his assent to whateverdecision they may reach here . But , to prevent any shifting of opinion , he secretly exacted from each and every one of them a promise , given under oath , to vote for none other than his choice . " After pausing to allow the confusion among the delegates to become apparent to everyone in the assemblage , the Pope raised a forefinger solemnly in the air . " You are hereby absolved from the oath thus demanded of you . You may consider yourselves free to debate the issue and to arrive at your decision without regard to any earlier commit-ment . " The pontiff next proceeded to make his purpose abundantly clear . " There is one among us today , " he said , " of great gifts and of such dedication that no one excels him in understanding and in the expoundingof the Word of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an Englishman as well . " A stillness fell over the hall . Stephen Langton 's face could not be seen , for his head was lowered . His hands gripped the rail in front of him and it was clear that he was saying a silent prayer . Later he let it be known that it had come as a surprise , that nothing had been said to let him know of the Pope 's purpose . Innocent addressed himself again to the delegates from England . " The issue is in your hands . " The Canterbury monks filed out through a side door , their faces reflectingthe varying emotions they felt . The pontiff was too busy to spend any length of time in waiting on a decision of this nature . In a few minutes he retired but word reached the chamber later that his attendance had been requested by the delegates to decide some point of canonical law . He spent a quarter hour with them and undoubtedly took advantage of the opportunity to make a more direct and forceful presentation of his wishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall soon thereafter . They had chosen Stephen Langton with only one dissenting vote.  |p191It  was dark when Richard passed through the gates beyond which the will of the Pope was the law . Rain clouds filled the sky and the first damp gusts of an approaching storm moistened his face and caused him to hasten his steps . His cloak was damp by the time he reached his own doorway and he paused to give it a thorough shaking . Inside he found Tostig , busily engaged in superintending the strippingof everything from the chests and the walls , and having them packed in saddlebags . The latter looked around with a triumphant air . " We are going ! " he cried . " At dawn tomorrow . God grant the storm has passed by that time . " " To England ? " asked Richard . He could feel his heart beating with excitement . " To England . In spite of everything , Cardinal Langton is going to cross the Channel . His Holiness , knowing the temper of our good king , fears he will meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending us . " Richard seated himself in the nearest chair as he was finding it hard to breathe . " Tostig , Tostig ! " he said . " This is the best word we have had for many years . How I have longed to go back ! " Tostig crossed the room and leaned down to whisper in his ear . " Perhaps now we shall be able to do something about the two fair ladies the king holds in captivity . " " You may soon be a married man , Tostig . Your Giselle is not a prisoner . " Tostig shook his head . " Giselle will never consent to leave her sister . I know her well enough to be sure of that . " He brushed such speculationsaside . " We have a long day 's ride ahead of us . You must get as much sleep as possible . " " Sleep ! " cried Richard . " Waste these golden moments in sleep ? No , Tostig . There wo n't be a wink for me tonight . There 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen Langton did not reachEngland . On learning what had happened in the matter of theelection , John 's violence knew no bounds . He proclaimed that anyone acknowledging Langton as archbishop was a traitor . He had the Canterbury monks , who stood their ground , expelled in a body . Even the father of the new archbishop , an old and feeble man , had to fly for his life . On instructions from the Pope , the party halted at the Cistercian monastery of Pontigny in Burgundy . Once before this institution had offered sanctuary to an incumbent of the Canterbury see who had been exiled : when Thomas a Becket had been forced by Henry II to flee the country . No one in England , least of all the king , had believed that Innocent would carry out his threat of placing the country under an interdict . But when John showed no signs of amending his conduct , the Pope acted . One night three of the bishops of England , on instructions from Rome , entered their episcopal churches . Each wore the violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torches and chantingthe Miserere . The shrines and the crucifixes on the walls were shrouded under cloth , the relics removed , the Wafer of the Host burned . A proclamation was then read that all the land of England had been laid under an interdict . Instantly the lights were extinguished . They would not be lighted again , nor would services be held for burials , for weddings , or for christenings , until the ban had been lifted . The darkness of pagan days fell over England.  |p193The  two years that Richard spent in Pontigny seemed interminable . The monastery could not accommodate all of Langton 's train and so the knight lived in the house of a miller who was called Old Huitre . All day he stood in the archbishop 's anteroom to guard against any aggression from across the Channel . At night he shared a meal with the miller and slept in a dusty room above the wheels . To sleep was never easy . He would toss about and let his thoughts go back over the years since the two short days he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand times he thought of the morning when he had ridden away . How long it seemed ; longer than time , an infringement even on eternity ! One evening Richard was sitting at supper with Old Huitre ( which means Old Dunce ) and finding it hard to enjoy the cold mutton , cheese , and black bread which decorated the table between them . He had fallen into the habit of eating the last meal of the day with the miller because the enforced silence in the refectory at the monastery sat ill upon him at the close of his long and tedious days . It had become obnoxious to him to follow the sign language which was used to indicate wants , such as holding the tip of a first finger to the first joint of a thumb to convey the request , Pass the beans , or both hands joined obliquely to mean , More cheese . " My ancient friend , " he said , having noticed that the old man had never once during the meal looked him in the eye , " something tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " answered the miller , fumbling for the pewter platter which held the cheese . " It will not get better , young sir . " There was a long silence between them . The old man mumbled his cheese . " You are more observant than the others , " he said finally . " Yes , I am blind . The light went out of these poor eyes a full two years ago . " " Old man , it can not be ! I have watched you going about your work . You have served those who brought their grain to you . You find your way to church and the market place . And no one has suspected . " " Nonetheless , " declared the miller , reaching in three directions beforelocating his knife , " I am blind . As the means of calculation are withheld from me , I have no way of measuring the time . Except that my old bones have felt the cold of two long winters since I lost the use of my eyes . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal it from everyone ? "  | " Why ? I will tell you , my kind young friend . I have kept up this pretense because of fear . Fear ! Nothing else . " " But surely there is no need . You have five sons who would lend you their aid . You are well liked , you have friends . " " Sir Knight , " said Old Huitre in a tone of voice which reflected both grief and desperation , " my five sons are married and have their own homes but they watch me all the time , fearful of losing their share in what I have to leave . If they knew my sight had left me , they would be here day and night , watching , prying , waiting for the moment when I would betray the hiding place of my savings . If my sons did not do this , their wives would give them no peace about it . They would come themselves , those tight-lipped women . They would slip in when I could not see them , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me grain to grind would give me short weight and take more than their due of flour . Pity me , young man , I do n't dare to be blind ! I would be robbed of my money and my mill would be taken from me . Life would hand me a cane and say to me , Go out on the streets and beg , Bartimeus . ' " So , you see , I have n't dared let them find out . I have had to make myself so certain of every bit of space about me that I can move with assurance . I keep my eyes lowered so no one will detect the lack of response in my useless eyes . You , and you only , have guessed the truth . You must not betray me . " " I will never give you away , my ancient friend . I will do everything in my power to help you . Think of me as a staff on which you can always lean . " The blind have compensations in the sharpening of their other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that someone was coming to the mill . Richard turned to listen but heard nothing . " He who approaches is from that house of safe stone walls where most of my flour goes to fill fat bellies , " declared Old Huitre . " One of the monks , surely , for I can hear the slish-swish of his sandals . By Gis , he is in a great hurry . I can hear him panting . Something has hap-pened . " In a few moments Richard himself heard the scraping sound of sandals and almost immediately thereafter a monk appeared in the door of the mill . As the miller had declared , he was panting furiously and he had hitched his robe above his knees to facilitate a free use of his limbs . The newcomer addressed the Englishman.  | " You , m'sieur , are wanted . It is a matter of consequence . You will come at once , if it please you . " It was indeed a matter of consequence . Tostig had killed a man and , in doing so , had saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were still in the abbot 's garden with its high stone wall thick with vines . Stephen Langton was standing quietly under the wall and Richard saw that his heavy woolen gown had been ripped down one side and that blood was running from a wound in his shoulder . The body of a man was lying on the grass and Tostig was beside it , still holding by one leg the wooden chair which he had used in disposing of the archbishop 's assailant . The portly figure of the abbot could be seen approaching in waddling haste from the direction of the cloisters with several monks at his heels . It has been said that Stephen Langton was not unduly impressive in appearance but on this occasion he held all eyes . His face had gone white but it was the pallor neither of fear nor of relief at his escape . He was regarding the body at his feet with a look which held only compassion . He seemed completely unaware of the injury he had received . " You were right , my son , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a composed voice . " There was danger , after all . I stood in the eye of our Father in heaven and so I could not die ; but truly the Lord was all-wise in His choice of an instrument to carry out His will . How quickly our good Tostig moved to defend me ! " It seemed that , soon after his frugal supper , Stephen Langton had expressed a desire to walk in the abbot 's garden , the evening being warm and pleasant . Tostig , of course , had gone with him . Richard had made these arrangements . He himself was in attendance on the cardinal throughout the day and the squire was on hand for the rest of the twenty-four hours , even remaining outside the door while the great man slept . It was so very pleasant out , the evening air being heavy with the scent of the ripening apples and pears , that the archbishop had lingered longer than he intended and finally dusk had fallen about him . He was pacing up and down with his arms locked behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so was an easy target . A figure had sprung out suddenly from the shadow of an apple tree , a knife raised in the air . Because of the churchman 's desire for solitude , Tostig had beenp196following at some distance but he moved with such instant decision that he was in time to stay the blow of the murderous unknown with a chair he had picked up as he ran . One blow of the chair had broken the man 's skull . That he was dead was not to be deplored except that he was beyond the reach of questioning ; and that was unfortunate , for now they could only speculate as to his motive . " Who is it ? " asked Richard , looking down at the body , which was lying in a most unnatural position with one leg doubled under the other . " I think it 's Tuddual , " answered Tostig . " I caught a glimpse of his face as he fell . " " You mean the gardener who was ejected on the order of the abbot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad one . He was drunk much of the time and he had been convicted of theft , blasphemy , and the Sin . " " He was an attacker of women ? " " Three times . " Stephen Langton continued to look down at the inert body . " Poor fellow ! He had no chance to repent of his sins . He is beyond redemption . " The abbot arrived at this point . " My lord cardinal ! " he cried . " How can this have happened ? Within our very walls ! I am at a loss to account for it . " One of the monks who had followed him recognized the body and his explanation drew a sharply incredulous cry from the abbot . " Tuddual ! I thought we were through with that wicked man . I cast him out a month ago and the order was given that he was never to be allowed inside again . " His voice was reedy with exasperation . " My lord , I beg your leniency . There has been some grievous error . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archbishop , " you must spare yourself any blame . It would be an easy matter for one as familiar with the establishment as this man to find his way back in . The Lord was watching and supplied a strong arm to fend off the blow . I have come to no harm . " " I am not sure of that , my lord cardinal , " exclaimed the abbot . " You have suffered a wound which should have attention at once . I shall have Father Sosthene attend you to dress it . You are more badly hurt than you realize . " " It is probably no more than a deep scratch . " One of the monks had been examining the body . He rose to his feet at this point , holding a well-filled purse in one hand.  | " My lord abbot , I found this under his belt . " " May I be permitted to examine it ? " asked Richard . He took some coins from the purse and bent over to study them . " It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ha ! The motive is now clear , " said the abbot , happy to place the blame elsewhere . " Someone crossed the Channel with the intention of attacking you , my lord cardinal , and found a ready instrument in this man who has been a thorn in my flesh for so long . But I blame myself for not being severe enough with the rogue . He should have been kept in prison where he could do no harm . But come , my lord cardinal , you suffer while we talk . Do you feel capable of walking ? " " Quite , " answered the archbishop , smiling . He turned and took Richard 's arm . " But it may be wise for the surgeon to see to this shoulder at once . " The injured man and his escort left the garden through a gate which creaked on rusty hinges . They crossed the cloister garth and mounted a short flight of stone steps to the suite of two rooms which served the visiting prelate . In the inner one he kept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which he slept . The outer served as both oratory and anteroom and it was here that Richard remained in attendance during the day and Tostig through the night . It had one high and narrow window so it was often hot and breathless in summer . There was no hearth and it had to be heated in winter with a small brazier ; so in all seasons it was an abode of unremitting discomfort . " Come inside with me , my zealous young men , " said the archbishop , leading the way into the inner room . There was a single candle burning low on the table . Stephen Langton looked at this as though considering the substitution of a fresh one ; but , possessing in a full degree the churchman 's sense of frugality , he decided that this was not necessary . " Sit down , young men , " he said , falling into the chair behind the desk with a deep sigh of relief . The wound had begun to bleed freely and he was suddenly conscious of weakness . " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thank you , my stout Tostig , that I am alive this minute . With what miraculous speed you came to my assistance ! The Lord must have lent you wings . One second more and I believe the knife would have found a vital spot . I owe it to our kind Father in heaven , and to you , that I am alive and sitting here this minute . " Not being blessed with prophetic vision , none of the three men in the ill-lighted room could know that Tostig 's celerity had done much more than save the life of the Archbishop of Canterbury . If it had beenp198allowed them to see ahead and know the shape of things to be , it would have been clear that the whole world had benefited . Had Stephen Langton died , there would have been no historic document signed on a meadow beside the Thames in a matter of a few turbulent years . Perhaps mankind would have waited a long time for the impetus to personal freedom which began with the Great Charter . A century certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about in due course without a doubt , for the tyranny of absolute rule could not have been endured forever . Sooner or later the will to be free would have broken the bonds . Some dim sense of this may have been in Stephen Langton 's mind . At any rate he said in a reverent voice , addressing Tostig , " If a miracle brought you so swiftly to my aid , it was not to save my poor life but for a greater reason . . . . " This has convinced me of one thing , " he said when the surgeon had withdrawn . " You have been right , my good young men , in anticipating trouble . I am sure now that the situation in England is reaching a final stage . The king would not have gone to such lengths-for this attempt must have had his sanction  --  if he had not felt that things were reaching a desperate pass . " What other conclusion is possible ? " he went on . " The man had no grievance of his own against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence . Yes , he had been paid to put me out of the way . No doubt the agent who hired him was skulking outside the walls , with horses to make good their escape . " There was a pause . The archbishop frowned down at the papers on the worn surface of his plain pine table . " I receive reports from England , as you know . The latest makes it clear that the interdict weighs heavily on the people of England , that they are paying an unbearable price for the obduracy of the king . I would like to have a more thorough report on what is happening . " The benefit of another viewpoint from that of my correspondents , who are mostly living under cover , is what I must have . There should be a test of the temper of the common people . Someone must go from one end of the country to the other , talking to men in the shops , in the fields , even in the taverns . I must know if I may count on support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king . " He turned and looked steadily at Richard . " Are you ready to undertake this ? " Richard 's face shone with a sudden exultation . During the tedious months and years that he had been serving the archbishop , he hadp199entertained one great hope . To get back to England , to solve if possible the uncertainty , the mystery , which weighed heavily upon him . The fate of the lovely Eleanor had seldom been out of his mind . The uncertainty had haunted him as he idled the time away in the dark anteroom of the archbishop . There had been a feeling of certainty in his mind that he could get at the truth if he were in England . And now he was to have the chance . " Yes , my lord ! " he exclaimed , his eyes shining with eagerness . " I am ready to go . At once , if such is your will . " The dream which had filled his mind as a youth had been dispelled . He was returning to England to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the land of Canaan by Joshua to spy out the land , the two emissaries lost no time on the road . They traveled mostly by night and slept during the hours of daylight . So vigorously did they push along that they came within sight of Calais well ahead of the usual time . Before venturing into that gray old town , which had become a veritable hotbed of treachery and where every third man was a spy or a professional soldier since the ban of the Church had closed over England , they donned the garb of goliards , the wanderingminstrels who were so heartily welcomed in every corner of England . Their new clothes were particolored : one leg blue , the other gray , their tunics checkered and greasy with use , their hats boasting stiff feathers rising a full eighteen inches above the head . Richard carried a gittern over his shoulder , having gained some skill in the handling of it . A clever piece of facial disguise had been performed by Tostig which made the young knight look like a student who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up the easy way of a life on the road . Tostig himself , with tunic bursting at the seams in an effort to encompass such broad shoulders , could easily be mistaken for a tumbler . They went aboard on foot . A groom would follow with the horses on a later boat.  |p200They  were most successful as a pair of goliards , drawing crowdsabout them and afterward sitting down in the taverns to chatabout this and that and the state of the nation . It was frank talk to which they had listened . The country seethed with discontent and the interdict weighed heavily on the public conscience . True , priests could perform marriages outside the Church and there were services for the dead though none could be buried in consecrated ground . But the people of England could not accustom themselves to the locked and empty churches ( for the bells had been removed and laid away in straw and all the holy vessels had been taken down from the walls and the lighted candles had been blown out ) , nor to the feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wiles of the prince of evil . Everyone , it seemed , despised and hated John . It was not only because he had taken the consolations of religion away from them by his feud with the Pope . They hated him because he had murdered Prince Arthur , because every man 's life was in danger from his vile rages and his disregard for the law , and because no woman was safe from his lustful ways . They despised him because he was losing the war with France and letting the Angevin Empire ( of which all Englishmen were secretly proud although they ranted at the cost of it ) break up as a result of his lack of energy ; calling him John Softsword and sneering because he preferred to sleep late in bed with his beautiful young wife ( who had been stolen from another man ) instead of being early up and busy with affairs of state . Ways had been devised of sending back word to Stephen Langton of what they were finding , and so it had been certain that their mission was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of Tostig . That astute young man had not been content to contribute his feats of strength and balance to an evening 's entertainment . He had fallen into the habit of running comment on things in general as he went about his exhibition of skill . Having developed a dry sense of humor , he threw his audiences into gales of laughter . No one was spared the barb of his homespun wit but it was King John who bore the brunt of it . The squire had coined a phrase , " What lack ye , Jack ? " which he interjected into his talks at suitable moments . Why , he would ask , had Normandy been lost to the French king ? Why had the impregnable Chateau Gaillard , which Richard of the Lion-Heart had built , been surrendered to the French ? What lack ye , Jack ? Why were all fences in the forest being destroyed ? Why did the king hold two little Scottish princesses as his prisoners ? Was he more successful in making war on women ? What lack ye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and the crowds who gathered at village crossroads or in forest glades found this recurrent question much to their taste . They would take it up after him and shout the words with loud guffaws . Finally Tostig wrote some verses for a more telling use of the phrase . He was discovering new powers inside himself and one was a way with words . The verses had an immediate effect whenever he used them , bringing audiences to their feet to shout and cheer . Why are the steeples empty and still ? What of this king who rules us so ill ? What lack ye , Jack ? It did not take long for word of the activities of the wandering pair to reach the ear of authority . One day they ventured into London and it so happened that King John had chosen this time also to pay the city a visit . They watched him ride down Cheapside , a stout dark man in a cloak stiff with gold thread and a huge ruby dangling at his neck . His errand , it was known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so he was surrounded by calculating nobles and sour churchmen . There were no ladies riding with him , not even his very beautiful queen ( who had been worth stealing if beauty counts that much ) , nor was there any conspicuous rattling of armor nor a sign of the motley . On occasions the king could summon enough amiability to greet his subjectswith a good humor verging on levity but it was clear that he had no thoughts this day beyond his great need for pounds , shillings , andp202pence ; certainly he paid no attention to the noisy crowds assembled to greet him . Richard was studying the much-hated king with close attention when he felt a hand pluck at his elbow . " Follow me , " said a cautious voice from behind . He turned quickly and saw that the speaker was a man whose neatnessof attire bespoke high rank and whose dark , thin features were intelligent and alert . Brushing his lips with a forefinger to enjoin caution , the stranger turned about and began to make his way through the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they followed after him . The eyes of the population were fixed so intently on the puffy face of the monarch that no attention was paid to their departure . The stranger led the way inside the porch of one of the small churches which were so numerous in London . It was dark inside . The windows were covered with strips of canvas and not a single socket had its guttering candle . As a result of the interdict the walls were vacant and the shrines were stripped bare . In this gloom the paintings on the walls , which depicted the tortures of the damned , filled the interior with a sense of realistic horror . " Thanks to the king 's stubborn will , there is no place so private in all the world as an English church , " declared the stranger with a wry smile . Then he sank his voice lower . " You must leave London at once . It 's known you are here and our worthy king has declared in no uncertain tones that he wants you laid by the heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will show this mangy pair that I lack all compassion in dealing with base traitors , ' was the way he put it . It is clear , young sir , that you have been a burr in his saddle and a gripe in his stomach for many a long day . " " Friend , " began Richard , " for friend you must be to take such risks on our behalf . What advice have you for us , if we are to get away safely ? " The stranger spoke in low and hurried tones , for it was apparent that he desired to be free of them as quickly as possible . " Follow this street until you reach the river . There you will see a tavern with a sign , the Two Crones in Bice . Go in and ask for the landlord , Humphrey the Toss . Humphrey will set your feet in the safest path . " He raised a hand in warning . " Lose no time about it . Our good king will have no manner of luck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage mood . " Several decisions were reached that night in a dark room at the rearp203of the Two Crones . First , they were to separate . Tostig was to adopt the loose shirt and the tight leggings of a sailor and take his place on a wool barge which would unload farther down the river . From there he would ship to Flanders and make his way overland to Pontigny . Richard was to assume the garb of an itinerant merchant and take an empty barge on its return trip up the Thames . This was because he had declared his intention of continuing his joumeyings about England alone . Having fulfilled the purpose for which he had come , he was free now to devote himself to the quest which lay so close to his heart . At every stage of their journey they had heard speculations as to the fate of the Princess Eleanor . A few believed she had shared the fate of Arthur but most people were convinced she was being held a prisoner . The Lost Princess , they called her . In Norwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bristol . In Bristol it was said she was in a northern castle , right on the coast , in fact , so that the waters of the North Sea swirled about the foundations . The citizens of London were firmly convinced that she was in the Tower . " Ay , " said a stout individual who had come down the Thames on a wool barge and was holding forth in a tavern , " I saw her taken there . I was no more than a hop and a jump from her  --  if you leave out the hop . Ay , she was a beautiful lass , with hair as black as mine . " A small landholder in the Oxford district was convinced he knew the whole story . " They 're keeping her in a cell . " He waved a hand vaguely in a westerly direction . " It 's a dark little hole with no more than a slit for a window . Every day they hand in a loaf of bread and a jug of water . That 's where the Lost Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " He gave his head a rueful shake . " It stands to reason that she 's dead and gone and tucked away with a spade by this time . " Richard 's hopes rose and fell , according to the nature of the guesses and conjectures they heard . Once , in an East Anglian village , Tostig found him sitting in silent dejection on the low stone enclosure of a cemetery . A dozen plain wooden coffins were piled up along the outside of the wall , awaiting the time when the interdict would be lifted and the dead could again be confided to consecrated ground . Storm clouds were blowing down from the north and a wind was shaking the trees in the grove behind the graveyard . It did not require a vivid imagination to believe that the sound came from the neglected souls being denied their proper rest . " What is it , Master Rick ? "  |p204Richard  shook his head despondently . " It is quite possible , Tostig , that she 's dead and waiting for burial like this . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows where she is ? " " You may be sure of this : if the king has had her killed , the body will be so well disposed of that it will never come to light . " The squire studied the sad face of the young knight . " She 's alive , Master Rick . I am certain of it . Giselle is with her and would have died at the same time ; and I know that she is alive . I have seen her in my dreams and she always looks at me with a cheerful smile . " One night Richard was sitting at the long and hospitable board of his old friend , Alain de Casserlie . He was seated near the end of the table . Alain , sitting at the head with his beautiful young wife beside him , had no idea that he was being honored in this way ; for Richard was dressed in the plainest of cloth tunics and was being most careful to keep out of the earl 's range of vision . Alain had developed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and florid of face but most pleasant and complaisant in manner . He and his auburn-haired bride were so devoted to each other that they paid little attention to any of the guests . They whispered together and laughed often , and once the slender wife allowed her head to rest fleetingly against his shoulder . " Alain is a lucky man , and a happy one , " thought Richard , with an inward sigh . It was his hope to have a few words later with his old friend but he realized that Alain must not show any recognition of him in full sight of the household . Accordingly , he kept himself as much out of sight as possible behind the lubberly shoulders of his neighbors and took no active part in the talk which filled the oak-beamed hall . Sleeping accommodation for the casual visitor was always limited , even in castles as large as Casserlie , and Richard found himself put to the necessity of choosing a place for himself on the rush-covered floor of the Great Hall . A half dozen others were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself a spot at some distance from the others , for the good reason that he was wearing his sword under his long woolen tunic and did not want anyone to discover it . With a rounded length of firewood to serve as a pillow , he stretched himself out and fell promptly to sleep.  |p205He  was wakened by someone tugging at his shoulder . The Hall was in complete darkness . " Richard ! It is you , is n't it ? " He realized then that it was his old friend who had roused him and he sat up with great pains to make no noise . " Alain ? " " Yes , Rick , old friend . But do n't make a sound . We must not waken any of the flea-bitten rabble . " They walked on tiptoe , making their way out through the oaken screens . Here the head of the household retrieved a candle he had left in an alcove before venturing into the Hall . By the light thus afforded he studied Richard for a moment . " I recognized you at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I gave no sign . It would have been very difficult for both of us if I had , because you have succeeded in rousing our gentle and puissant king to a state of most unusual ferocity . " " I should have left the country with Tostig but there  --  there was something I had to attend to first . " " May I ask what it was ? " " I must know what has happened to the Princess Eleanor . " There was a pause while the owner of the castle studied his visitor quizzically by the flickering light of the candle . " Then there was some truth in the rumors which reached us . " Richard looked his surprise . Brittany had seemed a long way from England and , in any event , it had all happened years before . " What was it you heard ? " he asked . " Well , there was a story whispered about , here and there . The princess , so the story ran , had been very brusque with you when you arrived in Brittany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cham . When you unhorsed him  --  ah , my old friend , what a thrill I had when the news of that reached my ears  --  then she began to look at you with different eyes . It was even said she was sorry you had to leave so soon and was inclined to mope for some time thereafter . Such , at least , was the way the rumor went . " " The princess won my entire allegiance ! " declared Richard . " I would risk my life at John 's hands if I could do anything to clear up this mystery . I would die gladly in her behalf ! " Alain remained silent for several moments , turning the candle downwardand holding a hand above the flame so it would cast no light onp206them . " I can see it would have been wiser if I had kept my tongue between my teeth , " he said finally . " Alain ! " said Richard , clutching his friend by the arm . " You know something ! What is it ? You must tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know where she is being kept ? " Alain indulged in a long hesitation . " If I did know something and was rash enough to tell you , I 'm certain you would rush in and get all of us into serious trouble . There 's a mad look in your eye . " A further period of hesitation followed . Then the owner of the castle gave his head a sudden nod . " Yes , " he said . " Yes , to both questions . The princess is alive . I know where she is being kept . " Only concern for the welfare of his host kept Richard from shouting aloud in sheer exultation . Eleanor was alive and the secret of her whereaboutswas known to his friend ! The weight rolled from his heart . " Alain , you will tell me ? I must know . I must . " " Having involved myself to this extent , I suppose I might as well go on . Yes , I will tell you . But not here , old friend . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chamber I share with my wife . She will be asleep and dreaming sweetly by this time , my rare little beauty , and so we wo n't disturb her . It 's the only place where we will be able to speak safely . " Alain lighted a long candle when they reached the solar and then bolted the door behind them . The guest looked about him with some hesitation , feeling very much of an intruder . He perceived that the room , which was large , contained a high French bed . Unlike the Englishtype of tester bed , this one had curtains which rose above the top of the frame in a spiral and reached almost to the distant ceiling . The curtains were tightly drawn . The room was surprisingly bare : a crucifix on one wall , a table , two chairs . A half-opened door revealed a closet in which clothing hung . A vessel in one corner , shaped on the order of a tulip , might have been a bath . All the windows were closed tightly , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this . On arriving that afternoon , he had realized that the volume of water in the moat had shrunk through evaporation and was failing to carry away the scum which ran down the outside of the walls from the privies above . The late summer odors which always hung about great castles were , as a result , more prevalent than usual . " Let us sit here in a corner , " said Alain in a whisper . " We must not disturb my little red-crested bird . "  | " She is wondrously lovely and appealing , your lady , " said Richard . " I found it hard to keep my eyes from her face this evening . I am sure you are a completely devoted couple . " " She means everything to me , " declared the lord of the castle . " I love her so much that sometimes it is like a great pain in my heart . And to think there was a time  --  although you may have forgotten it  --  when I told you I would give all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry her , if I could go with you into the service of the lord marshaI ! " " So ! " A voice had spoken behind them . Turning with a feeling of guilt , the two friends saw that the curtains of the bed had been parted sufficiently to allow a face to peer through them . A delightful face , but an indignant one . A face from which all traces of sleep had been banished . A face with crisply curling hair , which had seemed auburn in the light of the candles at the table below but now looked more nearly red . " So ! " the owner of the face repeated . " That is how much you care for your unhappy , despised , uncared-for , unwanted wife ! You were willing to trade her for a chance to go into service where you would wait on other ladies , and perhaps make love to them when their husbandswere n't about , and spend all the rest of your time wrestling and fighting and tilting ! How fortunate it was that I wakened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife whom I adore above everything else on earth ! " cried Alain , running to the bedside and casting himself down on his knees . " It was when the match was made by our parents that I said those idle , meaningless words ! We did n't know anything about each other . You were twelve years old and I was sixteen . " " I loved you , " said the indignant beauty in a voice of increased hauteur , " from the very first moment I saw you . I went home in a glow of happiness ! Why do I demean myself by telling you now ? Because you  --  well , the truth is out . You did n't care for me at all . " " My angel from heaven ! " cried Alain . " I would n't give you up for all of Christendom , with a slice of the moon thrown in , and all the light from the sun and enough stars to make a necklace for you ! And I would include all of Prester John 's country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gingerbread walls , and its miles of blazing kitchens with chines of beef and haunches of venison hung up on pegs ! " There was a pause after this sweeping profession of devotion . Thep208light of battle began to recede from the blue eyes peering through the curtains . After a moment a smile replaced the stern line of the mouth . " Your apology is well and truly spoken , my Alain , " said the young chatelaine , " and you covered a great deal of ground , did n't you ? On the whole , I am inclined to accept it and say that we will forget the whole matter . But I am treating you much more leniently than any other wife would . " " " You are the only perfect wife that ever sat by a man 's side , and teased him with her sweet moods , and slept so prettily in his bed ! " cried the now happy husband . Remembering then that this little conjugalscene was being conducted in the presence of a third party , " My dearest Adela , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I have spoken so often , the companion of my youth , Richard of Rawen . " " We meet under somewhat unusual circumstances , Sir Knight , " said the young wife , extending an arm between the curtains . This was quite a feat because , of course , it was customary to sleep in a state of nature and she had to leave herself one hand for the manipulation of the curtains . The extended arm was white and shapely and also , it must be confessed , a slight degree on the plump side . Richard dropped on one knee and printed a kiss on the small hand . " I am your devoted servant , my lady , " he said . " To intrude on you in this way is , I know , unpardonable --  " " It is all my fault , my heart , " declared Alain . " We had to find a place where we could talk and it seemed to me that only here would we be free of possible eavesdroppers . " He gave his head a nod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . What the tailor and his wife told us . " The head between the curtains looked startled . " But , Alain , my own , have we the right ? " " Of course , sweet chuck . . . . It was this way , Rick . A month or so ago a party came by late and begged beds for the night . We welcomed them , of course ; it is our rule to turn no one away , except for just cause . They were curious people . " " Alain , if it is to be told , let me tell it . There was a man and his wife and two maids , who turned out to be seamstresses , and a bodyguard . They came from London where they made the costumes for the court . " " The man , " said the lord of the castle , " was Rene of Tours and he was a tailor , of course . " " Yes , he designed all the robes , and the wife and the seamstresses did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suzette. "  | " They had a sumpter horse loaded with all manner of rich stuff . " " Alain , this is the part I can tell best . Ah , Sir Knight , it was a sight to gladden the heart ! Such rich materials ! Silks and satins and samite of heavenly colors . Light blue , lined with orange . Scarlets to be edged with ermine . Velours so stiffly embroidered that it was almost like chain mail . Such girdles and tassels and buttons ! Such velvet for little caps and pearls strung on thread of gold ! " She had become so carried away that she extended an arm through the curtains and then , with a startledcry , withdrew it in a great hurry and wrapped herself up to the neck again . A look of alarm settled on her face . " Alain , I do n't think we should tell any more . " " Yes , my heart . Rick has a right to know . " " You think so ? " " Of course . " The delicate face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this . " Well , if you think so . You see , Sir Knight , this Rene of Tours was a boastful man . He said , Ah , what beauties we will make of these three little ladies at Corfe . " But , Master Tailor , ' I said , there are only two of the Scottish princesses at Corfe . ' He shook his head , True , my lady , but there is the other one '  --  he winked at me , the great , fat , soft creature  --  ' the one who has been there all these years . And , ' swounds , my lady , she is the most lovely of the three and as slender as ever . " Pay no attention to what he says ! ' cried his wife . There are only two princesses ! ' Three ! ' persisted the tailor . Then , ' I said , the third one must be the Lost Princess . ' The wife got out a long , sharp needle . Thou very Tim of simpletons ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your gizzern ! There may be three of them but there will only be two of us to be hanged if the king hears you have been blabbering , you soft-mouthed fool . ' The poor wife begged us to treat the matter as a deep secret and we gave them our promise . " Richard 's joy knew no bounds . " Then all the stories I have heard have been false ! She has n't been a prisoner in the Tower . She is not being kept in a dark cell without a window . She is safe and well . " Different moods had been chasing themselves across the pretty face of the wife ; a genuine delight in the finery and the pleasure of telling a very great secret , as well as the doubts she felt over the fitness of telling anything . Now she was , clearly , filled with uneasiness . " But , Alain , I feel very guilty . We promised them so faithfully not to whisper a word to anyone about there being three . " Main brushed this aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ littlep210worrier . What nonsense ! A promise to a tailor ? It means nothing when the interests of a knight are at stake . " " But we promised --  " " Rick will make us a promise that he will tell no one ; and that , being a pact made by one knight to another , will be a secret matter . So no harm has been done at all by telling him . " There was a frown still on the brow of the young wife . " But he could tell another knight and that would be a sacred vow , would it not ? Where might it end ? If the king knew the tailor had told us , it would go hard with that stupid man . I fear I am very dull but what is the difference in promises ? " " My sweet child , the same as the differences in birth and rank . A promise to a cook , a servant , a barber , a tailor ? Pouf ! It is nothing . Surely you must see that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demand from someone higher in rank ? From an earl , from a prince ? From the king himself ? " Alain pursed up his lips as he considered these questions . " An order from the king must be obeyed . " Then he paused . " But not all orders ; no , no , not all . We are finding there are times when we must refuse the royal will . Rick , do you agree with that ? " Richard , who had once been so convinced that unquestioned obedienceto the king was the first law , slowly nodded his head . " I have seen coffins piled high against churchyard walls , I have been everywherein a country where the priests of God hide in cellars and caves . Yes , I agree with what you have said , Alain . " " As there is still a frown on that sweet brow , I think we must demandthat not a word of this , not a whisper , will ever be spoken . " " You have my most solemn promise . I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , no matter what befalls , that I have been here . No blame can ever fall on the shoulders of this gossiping tailor . " " And where are you going ? " " To the Dorset coast . Where a certain tall and grim castle stands . I am going to  --  to spy out the land . "  |p211THE  autumn rains held off and the market towns were brisk withthe activities of harvest as Richard tramped through them . Inthe New Forest the deer were wary and all other wild animals hostile and sulky . The same feeling could be felt in Winchester , which was already suffering from the loss of Normandy and the encroachmentsof the eastern counties in the wool trade . It was downhill from that point and Richard took advantage of the favorable grades to hurry his footsteps . His heart sang within him , " She is alive and I know where to find her . " South of Salisbury the downs opened up and the roads ran through country of such plenty that it was impossible to harbor any feeling but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and the late roses massed themselves over the stone fences . A homeless dog attached itself to the dusty heels of the passer-by but became lost in the confusion of a cattle market . After passing Wimborne the freshness of the sea reached him and he knew that his journey was drawing to a close . Alain de Casserlie had spoken of an inn in the village of Corfe Castle and Richard had hoped to spend the night there . He was a little weary by this time , however , and his feet lagged . Dusk began to close in around him , the roads were suddenly flinty , and he had to pick his way carefully . He was on the point of giving up and seeking shelter at the first house which presented itself when he became aware that he was at the outskirtsof a town or village . The going was smoother and there were cottages on each side of the road . There was a solid dark mass high on the sky line which must be Code Castle . " This is the place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landlord will have something simmeringon the fire . "  |p212The  village , he found , clustered at the foot of the hill on which King John 's great castle stood . The square , in fact , ran straight to the castle gate and the village church faced the barbican tower across the paved surface . There was an inn on the eastern side of the square . The place was ominously quiet . There was no sound to be heard save the tramp of his own weary feet . Not a light showed anywhere . " Halloa within ! " he cried , knocking vigorously on the inn door . There was no response . He was considering the advisability of making his way into the dark interior when a welcome sound reached his ears , the clop of heels on the cobbled square . The figure of a man had emerged through the metal door in the tower . " A traveler , eh ? " said the newcomer , who was dressed in shapeless russet and wore a plated Ballet on his head . " They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted , " demanded Richard in some dudgeon , " or has an enchantment been laid on the place ? " " The women and children will be abed by this time , " said the man . " Sit down and wait . It wo n't be long now . " " If I knew of any other place to spend the night , I would be on my way . This silence makes my skin creep . " " If you were a minstrel , they 'd welcome you in the guardroom tonight . My name 's Marcady and I 'm one of them . When I left , they were sitting around and growling in sheer dullness of spirit . " " I made my living once as a wandering minstrel , " confided Richard , seeing the glimmer of a plan . " A poor living , I must tell you . Now I have this pack on my back filled with goods for sale . " " Peddlers are let in often . To please the women . " The man Marcady was studying the wanderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's dead against orders at this hour , " he said , as though to himself . " Robardi would be in a rage if he heard about it . " " Robardi ! " cried Richard . " Ay , the tim of toilers . He came from Brittany when the king sent over his prisoners . He 's second to the governor but it 's said that it 's always his word which goes . And that makes it hard for everyone . " The man made up his mind to the bold course and nodded to Richard . " You come with me . We can get in through the postern in the other side of the hill and you can get away by dawn . " " Robardi must n't lay an eye on me , " said Richard . " He saw me once . Across the water , it was , when I was not a peddler . " He had made up his mind to take the risk . An inner excitement hadp213gripped him which he found hard to conceal . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get inside the castle , to study its gates and walls , and to pick up information from the members of the garrison . A dozen Robardis , with malice in their heads , would not keep him away . " What brought you here ? " asked Richard of the guard . " An idle mind and nothing better to do , " said Marcady , grinning . " As I told you , things were dull so I spoke to Old Skull-Cruncher , who 's in charge , and said I was willing to stroll over and get the news of how things went . You 'll run into Old Scratch if you do , ' he said . But everyone was anxious to get the story . So here I am . Know you aught of Nicholas of Acre ? " Richard shook his head . " This is my first visit in this part of the country . " " Two days ago he sat in his garden looking peacefully to the south where the fresh winds come . Dame Gildy left him alone for a short hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his last campaign . Tonightthey are burying him in St. Martin 's churchyard . Just back of the church over there . " " But , my friend , no one can be buried in consecrated ground ! Not while the interdict lasts . " " Nicholas of Acre was a great soldier . He went to Ireland with Strongbow and a bit of land is there in his name . He marched behind William the Marshal in France , and it was at Acre , where he fought under our grand King Richard , that an arrow struck him in the eye . Ever since he has been sitting in his garden , with one side of his face puckered in a hideous scar but the other eye full of wisdom and kindliness . The people around here loved the old man . Would they let him rot by the roadside because of the stubborn moods of a king who never went to the Crusades ? " " So that is it ! " " He 's laid away in his grave by this time , " said Marcady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his turn at the digging so the blame could n't be fixed on a few of them . " He peered into Richard 's face . " If ye want to come , we had best be on our way . " " Lead , then , " said Richard . The heavy gray-black of the sky seemed to undergo a disturbance as they began to skirt the high hill . A wind perhaps was responsible for a visible stirring in the leaden quality overhead ; at any rate , a menacing black seemed to develop above this little corner of the earthp214where a group of bold villagers were defying the laws of the land and the dictates of Rome . The two men stopped of one accord and looked up . " Is it because of what they 're doing over there in the churchyard ? " asked Richard in an awed tone . " I think not , " answered Marcady . " Father Bernard will be there to say the words over Old Nicholas . They 're coming back , you know , the priests who ran away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin every one of them alive that he could get his hands on . I saw the stringy old neck of Father Bernard through a window in the village the other day . " " I have heard of other cases . Think you it is going on all over the country ? " Marcady nodded confidently . " There were two churchmen at the castlea fortnit ago and I heard some of their talk . Yes , friend , the priests are coming back . And they are saying services for the dead and performingmarriages . A sister of mine was wed up on the edge of the Marcher country a month ago with a procession to the church , and kneeling under the carecloth , and dancing of prinkcam-prankcam after-ward . " " What does the king think of it ? " " He smiles his broadest smile and winks at his ministers . Will he worry if the people refuse to obey Rome any longer ? He wants them to toss the interdict aside like a worn shoe . " " But , " said Richard , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There will he no smiling or winking in heaven over this kind of dis-obedience . " The mood of the soldier changed . " Ay , and that 's a true word you 've spoken . When the Church sat down and folded its hands , the Devil came to England ; and he 's never left . You , friend , have been across the water and you do n't know of what has been going on . Old Scratch has had a great trade in English souls . He 's seen all the time , searching around the coffins in vaults and by the sides of roads . He always has a bag over his shoulder and something in it that squirms and cries . out . A brother of mine saw him at it and the look the Horned One gave him from his terrible black eyes left my brother in a dead faint which he did n't recover from until the sun came up . He 's no clunch , that one , he 's everywhere at once . He 's been seen twenty places in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling his terrible smile . Do you know that six times bells have tolled in empty steeples ? Anp215urgent , desperate ringing , as though the bells were crying out to the people to awake . " " Do people live , then , in a state of dread ? " The soldier laughed in a scoffing tone . " The people are the real clunches , " he said . " At night they lie in bed and tremble , but when the sun comes out they forget all about it . They get out of bed , these brave , bold fellows , and they laugh and say , Where is this Old Scratch ? Let me see him and I 'll show him how poorly I think of all devils . ' They never learn . Even though the fierce winds sweep up from hell , and horrible shadows fall across windows at night , while chains rattle and voices moan at keyholes . I 'm sure they marched boldly over there to St. Martin 's with the old man 's body on their shoulders but they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be following them in a great rage and he 'll buffet them with unseen hands . All this night long he 'll roam the streets of the village , his eyes blazing like the wildcat 's . " The battlements of Corfe Castle had been high above them as they talked . Richard was glad when their stiff climb up the rear of the hills brought them to the back exit in the mountainous walls . A moment later the gate clanged behind them , shutting out the dread and mystery of the night . From the outside , Corfe Castle had seemed black and forbidding , without a single light shining in its walls to hint at human habitation ; a jumble of high towers on the crest of a hill and extending far up into the uneasy sky . Lights greeted them , however , as soon as they entered by the northern sally port . They had come directly into the inner bailey and to their left stood the towers in a formidable clump . Plenty of lights twinkled now in the lower part of the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be seen from the outside . Richard lingered behind his guide long enough to study the largest structure , which , he knew , must be the King 's Tower . It stood a full hundred feet above an open paved platform ; the favorite residence of the king , perhaps because of the safety it afforded him . It was , he knew , the keeping place of the royal regalia . Beyond were lesser structures , one of which would be the Queen 's Tower , where the constable was lodged . They reached the platform by means of a long stretch of open stone steps and here Richard paused again to look about him . William
