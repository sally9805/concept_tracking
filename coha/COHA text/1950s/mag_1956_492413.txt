They Risk Their Lives for Fun These danger-loving climbers seldom conquer lofty mountains , just " impossible " cliff 's in their own neighborhoods . For extra thrills , they test their ropes by leaping into space . By HAL BURTON derway of wooden cleats , by any tourist free from vertigo and willing to essay a rock slope of moderate steepness . The northwest face is something else again . Sheared and polished by erosion , it soars 2000 feet above a mass of tumbled boulders , tilted ledges , and trees clinging to crevices in the rock . The boulder slope rises another 3000 feet . Bestor Robinson and Richard M. Leonard , who pioneered rope climbing on the Yosemite cliffs in 1931 , dismissed the northwest face long ago as " so awful it might as well be forgotten . " Millions of casual visitors , endowed with less precise knowledge , have looked upward from the valley floor and arrived at the same conclusion . There are , however , stubborn people in this world who refuse to admit that anything is impossible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exacting sport of rock climbing . The figure is necessarily flexible , since advancing years and increasing prudence cause a certain number of rock climbers to retire annually to less strenuous pursuits . There always arc replacements , who carry on the tradition that a cliff is to be esteemed more highly than a mountain summit . Among this group , the northwest face of Half Dome is regarded . as one of the most tantalizing climbing problems in the United States , demanding a respectful approach and a painstaking reconnaissance . Rock climbing , a British authority on the subject once observed , " is a game played slowly , which goes not to the swift , but to the skillful and levelheaded . " The men oh Half Dome , who had already scrambled up the boulder slopes now were crawling up the sheer cliffs of the northwest face at the rate of only 200 vertical feet per day , or about one seventh the height of the Empire State Building . To storm the cliff in one sublime burst of speed would have been suicidal , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion was reached  --  to search for a possible way to the top and to make the assault later , after careful planning .

We can not even buy milk . " I sat back . I was appalled . " Suzy , you should have told us this before . Do n't you realize we can " No , no , " she said hastily . " Not reason tell . I explain Miss Keller . " " Oh ? " " Miss Keller is like Occupation . Miss Keller is like America . She is new way to look at things . She is new hope . " I thought about it for a moment and then gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that I had tortured Suzy long enough . " I see , Suzy , " I said . " I understand . Thank you . " She returned to her desk . Again I saw that look of stoic patience come into her young face . The minutes ticked by . All at once I rose . " Come on , " I said . " We 're going downstairs . " " But the office ? " " The hell with the office , " I said ; and locked the door behind us . A tremendous crowd of Japanese and Americans had gathered in the lobby . Every Japanese in the building seemed to be there . The atmosphere was electric . It communicated itself to Suzy and me , and in the last few minutes , when the motorcycles on the street roared back to life , we almost held our breaths . Then she came . I had never seen Helen Keller before , and I was totally unprepared for the experience . Guided by her companion , Polly Thompson , she came quickly out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a light so bright , so happy , so radiant it took our breaths away . Without even thinking , we burst into applause . This was not ordinary applause . This was a tribute to a moral and spiritual triumph . At once a wonderful smile spread over her face . It illuminated the heart . It was the most beautiful , heart-warming smile I had ever seen . She looked around at all of us with joy . I could n't believe that she could neither see our faces nor hear our spontaneous , heartfelt tribute ; she could only feel it on the air . For a moment longer she smiled around at us , a loving , grateful , happy woman . Then she was gone . It was as if a light had gone out . The motorcycles roared away . We returned to our work . maze of cracks and along two ledges , each of which provided somewhat rudimentary lodging for the night . Where holds were scant for hands or feet , they hammered in thin pegs of steel , called pitons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope could be attached for safety . From time to time , to the annoyance of everyone , the cracks ran out and only a smooth wall bulged above . Rock climbers have a way of dealing with such problems . When pitons are uselms , there is always the expansion bolt , equipped with a ring on its outer end and a collar of lead on the inner end . Six times , standing in slings of rope , Robbins used a hammer and drill to bore into the cliff , and then hammered in bolts . The lead collar , expanding as the bolt was tightened , scaled itself solidly to the rock , The result was a virtual ladder of steel up walls so sheer and holdless that most mountaineers would have given up in disgust . The supply of food , the water in the canteens and the time available all gave out simultaneously the third morning , but the party had found what it sought : A route that would " go , " as nearly as a practiced eye could tell . A fine tracery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back . This Much later that afternoon , I called Suzy to my office . I had just come back from a visit to the other divisions of our section . " Suzy , we have something for you here , " said . " I do n't want you to be embarrassed about it . It 's from all of us  --  everybody in the section . It 's for your father . You understand ? So he can go to the hospital . " She stared at the envelope . Though she did n't know it , it contained more than 60,000 yen  --  almost a year 's salary . " Captain , I did n't mean ? " " I know you did n't , Suzy , " I said . " You were talking about something else . But never mind that . We want you to tell is where he goes . You understand ? And we want to follow it up  --  make sure he has medicines , X rays , milk . The things he needs . " Trembling , she took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control herself . " You see ? " she said . " It is same thing . Same as Miss Keller . " " What do you mean ? " " Always we accept our troubles . It is tradition . We shrug our shoulders . We say nothing can be done . Americans not the same . Americans like Miss Keller . Waka-nmaska ? " I stared at her . And all at once I understood . This was the one gift we could say we had brought them , All their lives , for centuries past , they had accepted their misfortunes . They had endured poverty , illness , malnutrition , famine , earthquake , typhoons and wars . They had resigned themselves ; the misery of their lives was beyond remedy . Now they had a new hope . It was something that came to them from the New World . They did n't yet fully understand it . But the essence of it was this simple action by a handful of Americans to do something about her father . And the symbol of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Miss Helen Keller  --  who had not just accepted blindness , who had not just accepted deafness , who had not just accepted a mute tongue , but who had learned to sec , to hear , to speak . and to fill every human heart who saw her with pride in the human spirit . " Go along with you , Suzy , " I said . She started to bow . Then , by a whisper that came to her from another way of life , she stood up straight and shook my hand . spring , when the snows have melted fonts the valley floor and the nights arc warm enough so that a man can sleep on a cliff , Robbins intends to lead the first complete climb of the northwest face . At best , there will be six bivouacs  --  now and then with space enough to sit down , but more often standing upright in rope slings , The reward , if you wish to call it that , will be the conquest of the imix.wible . Sometliiiig so close to sheer misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely the average man 's clish of tea . But rock climbers are a particularly tenacious breed , who get themselves into the most hair-raising predicaments in order to get out of them triumphantly . The Yosemite cliffs  --  smooth , spectacular and handy to the highways  --  have inspired some prodigious climbing , based on a lavish use of artificial aids , Purists , who refer to the Yosemite cragsmen as " rock engineers , " somewhat patronizingly talk of " mechanized climbing , " conducted up a ladderway of steel . Whichever faction possesses the true gospel , both agree that Yosemite exerts an overpowering attraction for rock climbers . This is best ( Continued on Page 101 ) February 25 , 1951 101 ( Continued from Page 99 ) demonstrated over the Memorial Day weekend , when hundreds of Californians show up with ropes and rucksacks for the annual rock-climbing outing of the Sierra Club , an organization of approximately 10,000 mountaineers . It is an incorrect assumption that most rock climbers are teen-age daredevils with no visible means of support . Of the men who reconnoitered Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wilson and Galwas graduate students . Among sedentary sports , the best counterpart is a rousing game of chess , which calls for intense cerebration and an almost psychic knowledge of what lies ahead . There is one substantial difference . A wrong move on the chessboard is seldom more than humiliating ; a wrong move on a cliff may be fatal . The point of divergence was never more clearly illustrated than in August . 1946 , when Jack Arnold , Anton Nelson and Fritz Lippmann climbed the Lost Arrow , a knife blade of rock 1300 feet high , sticking out from the cliff midway between Yosemite Point and Upper Yosemite Falls . ( Set : WE CLIMBED TILE IMPOSSIBLE PEAK , by Fritz A. Lippmann , The Saturday Evening Post , June 2B , , 1947 . ) This smooth and seemingly unattainable spire had been attempted eleven times previously . After five days , the climbers finally managed to lasso the summit from a point on the valley walla Two of them descended to a notch goo feet deep , separating the Lost Arrow from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of the rope . ascending it to the lop . After the rope was made fast , in the manner of the circus performer staging a " slide for life , " Lipprnann crossed over the void and joined his companions atop the Arrow . Four years later , in June , 1950 , Alan Steck and John Salathe completed what Steck calls " an ordeal by piton , " spending four nights and live days on the 1500-foot north wall of Sentinel Rock . This modest project used up 156 pitons and nine expansion bolts , and " I 'm still not quite sure why I did it , " Steck told me recently . In terms of time spent and results achieved , Sentinel Rock was notable , but Half Dome still holds the record fur the number of overnight guests accommodated , The volume of vertical traffic in Yosemite Park forced the National Park Service to establish a rescue team of ten rangers , all of whom are trained in the most complicated rock techniques . " The experienced climbers rarely cause us much trouble , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent . " What gives us a headache is the lost children and the people who decide to take a short cut off the trails . They 're the ones who always get themselves stuck on a cliff  --  ca n't go down ; ca n't go up  --  at just about dark . It 's lucky for us that this valley is so small . Anyone who hollers for help , once people have gone to bed , can be heard fur six miles around . " It is possible to overdo a good thing , however , as one rescue established last June . Michael Simon , sixteen , was hiking along the top of the cliffs with a group of friends when he decided  --  what else ? ? to take a short cut to the valley . He wound up in a cluster of trees and sheer ledges known as " the Jungle , " in the middle of the Royal Arches , one of the most difficult cliffs in the park . Unable to go either up or down , Simon proceeded to scream for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break in on his monologue to let hint know that rescue was at hand . The cacophony lasted until midnight , when he fell into an exhausted sleep on a broad and safe ledge , but it started again in the morning . A rescue team headed by ranger John Henneberger , meanwhile , was conducting a most delicate climb of the Arches . The rangers could hear Simon , but they could n't hear each other  --  a difficult situation when a climb is being conducted in pitch-darkness with occasional aid from a flashlight . " He was in the midst of his last and biggest ' Help ! ' " said Henneberger , " when 1 finally stepped out from behind a tree and tapped him on the shoulder . We got him up to the top of the Arches and walked him down over a foot trail , but bet that boy had a sore throat for a month after . " Two other rescue expeditions last year were less humorous . On April eighth , Ann Pottinger , nineteen , a student at Stanford University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spire . A snowstorm threatened and the rangers at park headquarters had warned the party  --  which registered in advance for the climb , as required by park regulations  --  to turn back if the weather worsened . At 10:90 that night one of the climbers staggered into headquarters again and said . " I 'm afraid Ann is in trouble . We had to leave her at the foot of the Spire and come down for help . " By midnight , in a blinding snowstorm , a rescue team reached the girl . She was dead from exposure  --  probably because her clothing consisted of cotton jeans , a cotton shirt and a light poplin jacket . At the end of May , the rescue crew faced ICS most severe test . Helene von Ryckcrvorsel , a graduate student at the University of California , was leading a climb an the Royal Arches . This wall , rising directly above the Ahsvahriee Hotel , is one vast slab of rock inclined at seventy to eighty degrees , with few places where a climber can hold on . In such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rock and moves ahead to the nearest solid ledge . This is known as friction climbing . The pressure of rubber soles and bare palms on the rock is sufficient to prevent a slip  --  in most cases . But Miss von Ryckervorsel fell ninety feet . She was held by the second man on the rope , who had braced himself on one of the few available outcroppings . It took simervising ranger John Mahoney and the rescue crew of five men most of the night to reach her . " I have never seen such injuries , " said park naturalist Glenn Gallison , a member of the rescue crew . " There was a hole in the back of her head , and there were so many bones fractured that I 'm surprised she did n't die right there on the cliff . " The rangers dragged is mesh-and-aluminum rescue litter up to the scene of the accident , tied themselves on to the rocks while they administered first aid , and in two and a half hours brought Miss Ryckervorscl down to the valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the case of the Two Missing Men . On July .20 , 195 ? , Walter Gordon , a student at the University of California , bought steaks for an outdoor picnic in one of the campgrounds. told his companions , " I 'll be back before dinner , " and set out on a hike from which he never returned . The result was one of the most concentrated searches the park has known . The next day , bloodhounds were put on Gordon 's trail . They led the rangers up the path to Glacier Point which overlooks the valley , and down the Four Mile trail to the highway , There the scent apparently vanished . As many as thirty rangers blackened the cliffs , searching for Gordon 's body , and for days a helicopter flew up and down the valley while spotters stared through field glasses . The search was hopeless ; Gordon is still missing . Three months later , on October 9 , 1954 , another University of California student was walking along a footpath near the Ah  --  ahnee Hotel with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting up there , " said Orvar von Laas , thirty , motioning to the upper part of the Royal Arches cliff . " I 'll see you a little later . " He walked off into the underbrush and oblivion . Within thirteen hours the bloodhounds picked up his scent at the base of the Royal Arches climb , and tried frantically to scramble up the rock . Rescue teams roped up and covered the whole dill , with negative results . A helicopter flew alongside the Arches . Rangers searched for two solid weeks , keeping an eye peeled for a concentration of carrion birds that might pinpoint the location of a body . One climbing party discovered a bear , which departed with a startled snort , but nobody found von Laas . The FBI , called in because Yosemite is Federal property , checked every possible lead without result . In quiet hours , which are infrequent , the rangers are apt to speculate about Gordon and von Laas . Perhaps , they think , the bodies lie somewhere on the Yosemite cliffs , wedged behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time lapse is not out of the question . In September of 19912 Marjorie Farquhar , Jules Eichhorn and Richard Leonard , of the Sierra Club , made the first attempt to climb Washington Column . " Way up there on the cliffs , " says Leonard , " we found part of a human skull . Our guess was that it dated from prehistoric times But when we took it to the Department of Anthropology at the University of California . they said the skull had been there about a hundred years  --  just about the time the first fur trappers were exploring the High Sierra . I have often wondered who the poor fellow was who lost his footing and died , all alone , up there above Yosemite Valley . " A few years later a climber found some human bones in a little stream tumbling down the cliffs opposite Washington Column . In the same pool of water were an initialed watch and an old hat imprinted with the name of a store in Phoenix , Arizona . With the help of the FBI , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenix to extend condolences . " That 's strange , " she said . " He just left for school . But he did come back from Yosemite last year without his hat . " The bones apparently were those of a man who had vanished twenty years earlier . The sport of rock climbing , already flourishing in the Easr t , was introduced to California in 1931 by Robert L. M. Underhill , a professor at Harvard University and a mountaineer of distinction . The idea of tying on is rope to go up difficult cliffs had not heretofore occurred to the members of the Sierra Club , but once it caught on , the response was immediate . " The directors were horrified when we proposed that the club establish a rock-climbing section , " recalls Bestor Robinson , now retired as a rock climber , who practices law in Oakland , California . " They said we 'd be sued into bankruptcy in case of an accident , and added that the charter did n't make any provision for it . But six months later we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the California mountains , studied ponderous German texts explaining assorted ways of holding onto a ruck or of wriggling up a crack , ordered pitons from a sporting-goods shop in Munich , and proceeded to set up a training area on Cragmont Rock , a cliff in one of the Berkeley parks . This led to some complications . A lady whose home lay directly below the rock called the park department to say , " I do n't want any bodies falling in my back yard ! " None ever dist , but one climber took a moderate tumble , involving abrasions and contusions . Since the accident occurred on city property , Robinson had to report it to the police . The training climbs grew more and more elaborate until the Sierra Club felt compelled to set up a system of classification , based on European standards . Class I climbs were simple hikes ; Class II were rock scrambles ; Class III required the occasional use of is rope ; Class IV called for ropes and careful support from above ; Class V required pitons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded pitons or bolts for direct aid . Some hundreds of California climbs have now been meticulously classified and bound into a guidebook . From the experrimentsof the club , it may be accurately said , the United States Army developed much of its climbing equipment and a coherent doctrine for teaching green soldiers how to get up a cliff , if need be . This data was first imparted to the loth Mountain Division , which fought brilliantly in Italy during World War II . Before the end of the war , some .25,000 other soldiers had been taught how to climb in such assorted places as Lincoln , New Hampshire ; Natural Bridge , Virginia , and Mouth of Seneca . West Virginia . The old doctrines still are carried on in the canyons of Cheyenne Creek , outside Colorado Springs , Colorado , where the Army maintains a mountain-training area . One great contribution was the nylon rope for climbing . Until just before the war , no climber would consider risking his life on anything but a t  --  o-foot hunk of Manila rope . Nylon rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded with suspicion by Eastern climbers , but the Sierra Club decided to try it out The method of testing was somewhat unusual . Robinson , Leonard and David R. Brower , now the club 's secretary , found themselves a suitable rock , about thirty feet high , in a Berkeley park . One man would sit down , bracing himself solidly , and pass the rope around his body for a belay  --  meaning a position from which he could stop the fall of another climber . The second man would tic into the rope and jump off the edge of the rock . As he fell , the rope was allowed to slide , and then gradually tightened until the second man came to a stop not far above level ground . After twenty tests , the Manila rope broke , with some discomfort to the second man . The nylon rope , however , was still going strong after 200 practice falls . The test crew grew so proficient that at the end of the experiment the second man could leap eighteen feet into space before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earth . The nylon rope was adopted as standard by the Quartermaster Corps , in which both Robinson and Leonard served as officers . The practice fall , spectacular to watch , still popped the eyes of new recruits the last time I visited the Mountain and Cold Weather Command at Camp Carson , Colorado Springs . The sliding , or dynamic , belay has now virtually supplanted the method originated by the Swiss , which was to hook the rope firmly around a projection of rock . Too often , the rope broke . The Army developed few new climbers of the first rank , but a good many youngsters with prior mountain experience emerged from the 10th Mountain Division as mature and keen mountaineers . The most impressive veteran is a climber in his early thirties , named Fred Beckey , who has led more than .200 first ascents of cliffs and rock spires in the Pacific Northwest . By virtue of getting there first , Beckey has been able to name a number of peaks hitherto identified only by altitude . Since thousands were already christened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern Cascade Mountains , named by Beckey , reads like the wine list of a de luxe hotel . Chianti , Penrod , Burgundy , Sauterne and Chablis arc among the titles to captivate a thirsty climber , though Beckey is no winebibber himself . A man of great physical strength . Beckey decided last year to climb the west tower of Mt . Goode , a spire 8700 feet high , rising 9500 feet from its base near the head of Lake Chelan . With Don Claunch , another Seattle climber , he departed from Seattle at one PAL of a Saturday , arriving by car at the foot of Cascade Pass at five P.M. The two climbers then walked up over the pass , down the other side , and in to the base of the peak , a distance of sixteen miles , arriving at 1 I : 30 r.st . They slept until seven A.M. , Sunday , made the first ascent of the west tower , climbed back over the pass to their car , and reached Seattle at two a.m. on Monday . Beckey then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post-Intelligence r at eight a.m . On a later weekend , bored with the walk over the pass , he loaded a catamaran on a trailer , drove to the foot of Lake Chelan , and blithely sailed up to Stchekin , the starting point of his climb . The weekend finished , he sailed down the lake again to rest himself . Beckcy 's record of first ascents is now being challenged by Pete Schocning , another Seattle climber , who distinguished himself in an attempt on K2 , in the Himalayas , a few years back . Climbers in the Pacific Northwest are a little less scientific than those in the Sierra Nevada . The informal approach was epitomized in 1929 by Lionel Chute , who led the first climb of the North Peak of Mt . Index  --  elevation 6.100 feet  --  on the interesting theory that a cash reward was involved . The rumor had long persisted that the Great Northern Railway , whose tunnel under the mountain is one of the longest in the country , was prepared to pay from $1000 to f5,5000 for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Presumably , this would be profitable advertising . Chute , applying for the reward , found the railroad affable , but not prepared to dip into the till . Now in his fifties , he has a nice letter from the Great Northern and the satisfaction of having completed one of the most difficult climbs of his era . In the Northwest  --  a country of limitless forests , huge glaciers and dozens of unclimbed peaks  --  there are still plenty of conquests for those who have nerve and skill . The best illustration was provided , several years ago , by a Seattle chemist named David Harrah . In 1962 , while climbing Mt . Ycrupaja , one of the highest in Peru , Harrah 's feet were frostbitten . He lost most of his toes  --  a disaster , it would seem , to a rock climber , who must depend so thoroughly on delicate balance . Not long after , he led a climb up the 5000-foot northwest face of Mt . Johannisberg , in the Cascades , spending one night on the Last summer I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked across the valley at Johannisberg . The " easy " route leads up an almost vertical gulley of snow , with no sound place for a belay . Harrah 's route zigzagged up a buttress to the left , high into the clouds , so sheer that I had to crane my neck . I have rock-climbed in my time , but this cliff was too rich for my blood . Not too rich for a man with abundant will power , however . The tenacity displayed by Harrah is to be found , to a greater or less degree , in every rock climber . Perhaps this explains why a climbing club in Iowa will spend its weekends on fifty-foot cliffs along the Mississippi River or why some thousands of cragsmen in the East will work happily on rock faces ranging in height from 100 to 800 vertical feet . The most notable and most populated area is a wall of cliffs in the Shawangunk Mountains , about 100 miles north of New York City , on the west side of the Hudson River . Here the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes rising a maximum of ? too feet , but embodying the most hair-raising dilemmas to be encountered in the Rockies , the Sierra Nevada and the Dolomites of Italy . If regulations did not forbid it , New York mountaineers would do their climbing on the Palisades , which rise majestically just across the Hudson in New Jersey . Too many loose rocks , rolling down on strollers along the riverside , caused the authorities of Palisades Interstate Park to close the area to rock climbers years ago . The Shawangunk climbs were developed by Fritz H. Wiessner , now president of a chemical company in Stowe , Vermont . A short and balding man in his early fifties , Wiessner was  --  until he began to slow his pace  --  the best rock climber this country ever has known . As a young man in Germany , he led  --  without pitons  --  some of the classic rock climbs in the Alps . Rock climbing in Europe and England , as distinct from the ascent of great snow-and-ice mountains , began in the 1890 's , but the sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the piton was invented by an Austrian climber named Hannes Fiechtl . As a young man in Dresden , Viliessner absorbed the fine points of the sport , and brought to America in 1930 an entirely new technique , involving delicate and rhythmical movement on cliffs with no visible holds for the hands and feet . A man who believes in " clean " climbing as a greater test than the lavish use of pitons , he made the first ascent of Devil 's Tower , in Wyoming , with only one piton , where later climbers used them by the dozen . He also climbed I9,260-foot Mt . Waddington , in British Columbia , which had been attempted fourteen times previously . Wiessner is that rare being , an articulate climber . " Rock climbing . " he feels , " is the most satisfying and fascinating sport in the world . The landscape of mountains , the architecture of mountains , is something too few of us know . It is a sport and not a competition  --  matching yourself against something much bigger than any human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying what one 's own body can do , much as our ancestors who lived in trees must have enjoyed the easy movement of swinging from limb to limb . You are away from everything mechanical , and it makes you feel like a king , perched on a little spot up in the sky . You have overcome physical as well as mental difficulties . " To be a good rock climber , you have to put everything into it  --  to figure out your moves as you would in chess , except that on a cliff you are playing with the biggest queens , bishops , rooks and pawns on the planet . Even on the smallest cliff , there is something sophisticated about the delicate movements imposed on a climber . The mechanical stuff  --  the pitons and bolts  --  you can enjoy for a while , but in the long run you get your values from your closcSATURDAY EVEN1NC POST ness to nature , the realization how small we humans arc compared to the big mown-tams . It is something you can enjoy with the eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an escape from the pressures of the world . When those great walls of rock arch out above you , it is like sitting in the quiet and calm of a Gothic cathedral . " The man who leads a rock climb must recognize that there is danger involved , and he must keep it in mind , but if he has the talent , he can win through . He needs judgment as well  --  the ability to know what one ought to be able to do in a difficult spot . A good man climbs up and down such a spot a few times , always a little bit higher , until he knows how he can safely get through it Many men , not strong or patient enough , try to rush a cliff , and those are the ones who fall . They take chances , and they lose . A leader has to be able to fight against his own ambitions ; be able to turn around and to go home if the climb is too much for him . There are those who race to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in five or six years you do n't see them around any more . Most of them quit . The real climber sticks with it all his life . When the big ones are too difficult for him  --  well , he always can do the smaller cliffs and be just as happy . " It was on one of these smaller cliffs , a few days later , that I saw this philosophy put to the test . Wiessner and I had met in Chapel Pond Pass , near Keene Valley , in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State . Above us , fissured and seamed , rose a rock wall 400 feet high . No one had climbed it , but Wiessner was ready to do so . We tied in to the rope , and Wiesner started swiftly up through a narrow crack , the classic rock climber in action . Above him the wall leaned outward , for a space of perhaps fifteen vertical feet . 1 could see a few tiny handholds , but no easy way past this obstacle . With the utmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , leaned out from the rock and craned his neck . There was something about the route he did n't like . Silently , he came down again to a wide ledge , thought for a moment , and started up again , this time Selecting a slightly different collection of holds . Again , he paused to study the problem , and again came carefully down . " It will go now , " he called cheerily to me . So rapidly my eye could not follow his movements , he flickered up the ledge , hooked three fingers over a thin flake of rock and disappeared over the ledge above . I followed , but not with such ease . From his stance above , Wiessner was exerting a firm but steady pull on the rope . With this assurance of safety , I managed to claw my way through a maze of totally inadequate holds and to crawl on my belly over the top of the ledge . Off to the right a second wall led up to a projecting piece of rock broad enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This one was easy for Wiesner . He moved upward on scant foot- and handholds , turned his right hand so that it rested palm down on the projecting rock , fingers facing outward and wrist facing inward . Then he gently swung out over space , reversing his body , and sat comfortably down . When I followed , it was the triumph of brute strength over an obstacle that deserved more gentle treatment . I made a lunge myself p for theirouck. , hung on for dear life and hauled The rest was easy . A few more ledges , a few cracks to be climbed by jamming most of the body into them and inching upward , and we were on top of the cliff , with the eAdimndaelc.s spread out in front of us ? range pianfeter range of hills dark with spruce and " Look , Hal , " said Wiesner , sweeping his arm to encompass the horizon . " Does n't it make you feel like a king ? "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
