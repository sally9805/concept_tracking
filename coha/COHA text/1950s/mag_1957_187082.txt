Returning to Kingston , Jamaica 's capital , from a one-day outing at northwest-coast Montego Bay . 1,500 passengers aboard a Jamaica Government Railway excursion train were variously weary , tipsy , sleepy and raucous . Jammed into twelve ancient wooden coaches and two freight cars , they braced themselves against the sway ; some slept in the baggage racks . Then , at the top of a long downhill run in the mountainous central part of the island , the brakes failed . <P> Hurtling into an S-curve at the bottom of the hill , the train came apart . The twin diesel locomotives rocketed on down the track , pulling the freight cars with them . Five cars plunged into a field ; three others pounded one another to confused wreckage on the tracks . Another was derailed in a narrow cut . The toll : 178 dead and nearly 700 injured-biggest Western Hemisphere railroad death total since a Mexican train wreck killed approximately 200 in 1881.                    @
