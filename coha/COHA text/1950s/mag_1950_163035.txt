Horatio Alger , his rags-to-riches message in popular bloom , had died the year before . Stephen Crane , who had seen more of the rags than the riches and had written Maggie : A Girl of the Streets , was about to die at 28 . Pessimism and doubt were not hard to find on Jan 1 , 1900 , but the world , and especially the U.S. , sided with Alger . It looked forward to the 20th Century with a degree of confidence unequaled by any previous age and unregained since . Paced fast or slow , progress was sure , limitless , irreversible . Virtue walked with progress ; they fed each other . <P> In New York , which was to become the symbol and the power focus of the new century , * the weather on New Year 's Day struck just the right note . " The snow-flakes , " said the admiring Times , " were of that fine , crisp quality that lie and wear well . " The snow , the prosperity of the land and the mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preceding centuries . The worst was over ; man was out of the woods . <P> Mercy , Truth &; 2,500 Quail . William C. Browning of Browning , King &; Co. said : " In nearly 50 years of business experience I do n't believe I ever saw a time when prospects were so bright . " In parallel vein , the Rev. Michael J. Lavelle preached at St. Patrick 's upon the text : " Lord Thou hast blest Thy land : Thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob . . . Mercy and truth have met . . . justice and peace have kissed . Truth is sprung out of the earth : and justice hath looked down from heaven . " <P> Between spiritual and material progress the Times saw mutual support . It observed : " The finest flower that grows must strike its roots in material earth . . . The noble products of civilization spring from organized and intelligently directed industry . When men lived in caves and every head of a family had to kill his own bear or go without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns , or Dewey arches , and no poets reciting their verses of a Summer evening . " <P> Certainly there was no question of barehanded bear killing at the New York Athletic Club , whose 2,000 members and guests that afternoon consumed 2,500 quail , 600 partridges , several hundred grouse . The chef had also reconstructed Manila-in sugar-complete with Cavite Fort and Dewey 's fleet . If , later in the evening , any of the guests " recited their verses " it was not recorded . <P> <P> Marksmanship &; Green Moire . New York , the youngest of the queen cities , was smug and hopeful ; but Florence , the earliest capital of the modern world , was merely relieved that the 19th Century was over . Italy 's nationalist rebirth had indeed been glorious . Progress was everywhere ; some Florentines thought that there was too much of it . With a sigh and a shrug Florence 's Corriere Italiano saw the old century off : " Tomorrow a new year begins a new century we know nothing about . It does not matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
