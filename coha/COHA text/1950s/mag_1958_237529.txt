For months Gerard Mignone , 38 , an unemployed Brooklyn milkman , had been salivating at the very sight of NBC 's gaudy giveaway , The Price Is Right . The show promises a wondrous pack of prizes to any shrewd appraiser in the home audience who submits ( via postcard ) their correct prices . Mignone sent in hundreds of cards , became obsessed with the show . To check on prices , he organized an intricate filing system , hounded the Department of Commerce and called manufacturers all over the country . Said he : " I got a phone bill I 'm afraid to show my wife . I spent $200 tracing these things . " <P> But his bids always seemed to be a few cents off . Finally , when a giveaway house was at stake , Mignone decided that the only way to beat the game was to break the rules . He waited for the correct bid to be announced over the air , then faked a couple of postcards and tried to bribe two 16-year-old mail sorters ( with $3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's regular mail . The kids told the story to the cops , and when two detectives came for the Machiavellian milkman , he tried to take it on the lam . A warning shot fired over his head ricocheted off a building , hit him in the cheek and landed him in the hospital . Said his wife : " I tried to get him to quit , but all he cared about was that show . "
