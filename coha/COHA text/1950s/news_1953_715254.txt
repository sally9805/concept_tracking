txt BONN , Germany , Feb. 14 ? A serious dispute has arisen between the Allied High Commission and the West German Government concerning the latter 's unilateral interpretation of earlier agreements . ' Dhe controversy arose from a speech by Finance Minister Fritz Schaeffer to the Bundestag on Jan. 28 . The speech dealt with past and current occupation costs and fu ( ture contributions to the European Defense Community . Herr Schaeffer outlined a position on those problems that , if allowed to go unchallenged , would have serious consequences for relations between the armies of occupation and the Federal Government . Relatiens between the Federal Government and the future European Defense Community also would be affected . The statement by Herr Schaeffer that was regarded as offensive and ? dangerous was his contention that " the Federal Republic has committed herself only to pay a share of the maintenance of foreign troops stationed in . Germany , until June - 3Q , .1953 . " If enforced , this ' interpretation would undermine the material position of the armies of occupation after July 1 and destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining each Government 's annual financial contribution to the European Defense Community when that organization comes into being . The Allied High Commission challenged the Federal Government 's position in- the strongest terms this week in ? a letter to Herr Schaeffer and indicated that the Finance Minister had . presented a distorted picture of the financial burdens borne by the West Germans since the end of World War IL ' ilea Schaeffer based his unilateral abrogation of an . obligation on . the following arguments ; .1 11The Federal Government agreed to pay 600,000,000 Deutsche marks ( 5142.880,000 ) monthly for occupation costs from April 1 , 1952 , Contkoied on Page 13 , Column 1 ALLIES CHIDE BONN ON EASING BURDENS // until the European Defense Community treaty entered ' into force . cThe Federal Government also agreed to pay 850,000,000 Deutsche marks monthly from the time the treaty went into effect until June 30 , 1953 . This amount , according to Herr Schaeffer , included a direct contribution to the European Defense Community and the German share of occupation costs . Thereafter the Federal Republic 's financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he contended . Herr Schaeffer 's contention could have particularly serious consequences for the British forces stationed in West Germany . On several occasions the British have indicated firmly that they could not afford more than was already being spent in West Germany and that any increased burden might result in the withdrawal of troops and heavy equipment . Herr Schaeffer 's blunt announcement in his budget speech was held to be a unilateral decision in view of the fact that it is up to the NATO to assess each member Government of the E. D. C. The Finance Minister said the Federal Republic 's contribution was decided by taking into account data upon which the NATO Council was to compute the contributions of member governments . The Allied High Commission was said to have informed the Federal Government that the Firanee Minister 's contentions were likely to prejudice future negotiations on West German contributions to the E. D. C. The High Commission also challenged Herr Schaeffer 's figures for the agreed amounts that West Germany was to contribute before the end of the occupation . The part of Herr Schaeffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most was his assertion that West Germany 's occupation costs had amounted to 44,000,000,000 Deutsche marks ( $10,476.000,000 ) and failure , to mention the fact that this figure , even if acceptable , was more than counterbalanced by the many direct and indirect economic benefits West Germany has received from the Allies since the end of the war . The Finance Minister overlooked ' the fact that , among many such economic benefits , West Germany has received from the United I States alone $3,500,000,000 in direct , assistance as of last October and ' another $1,000,000,000 in counterpart funds , which were reinvested to help the revival of West Ger-I man economy . In addition to this $4,500,0000,000 ( almost 19,000 , -1 000,000 Deutsche marks ) , there ' were huge amounts of dollar conversions through United States Army procurements in Germany and conversions by troops who ( needed Deutsche marks for their purchases . Moreover , there was the cost of huge relief operations , the airlift to break the Soviet 's Berlin blockade and the value of industrial and private property returned to the West German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits received from the Allies and to balance them against occupation costs , the High Commission felt , Herr Schaeffer misrepresented the financial burden of the occupation on the West German people .
