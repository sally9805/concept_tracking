Next to Marriage We 'll Take Golf By BETTY HICKS A member id the troupe tells all about life on the women 's golf tour , with Rabe Zaharias ( " Why don'tcha girls all go home ? " ) , Patty Berg ( " Our healthiest hypochondria . " ) . Louise Suggs , Betsy Rawls , the Bauer sisters and all the rest . Most of the single girls , she says , have one eye on the ball  --  and the other peeled for eligible males . FFICIALS of the national women 's open 0 golf tournament were wringing their hands . Babe Didrikson Zaharias , leading after two rounds in the 1948 event in Atlantic City , bad just made a disturbing announcement . " I 'm going into New York tonight on business , " warned Babe , " and if somebody do n't raise that 81200 first-prize money before I leave , I wo n't bother to come back for the last two rounds . " The tournament committee faced the crisis bravely , but with empty pockets . If Babe went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member finally jumped to the rescue . He offered a $1000 bonus for anyone in the tournament who could total under 300 strokes for the seventy-two holes . It was obviously intended as a pay-off for Mrs. Zaharias . Babe was placated . She came into the seventy-second hole of the tournament needing a birdie four for 299 and the extra $1000 . Six feet from the hole in three , she missed the putt . " Oh , well , " she rasped to the gallery , " it would just 've put me in a higher tax bracket . " Like Babe , I am a golf professional . Unlike Babe , the prospect of being vaulted into a higher tax bracket has never worried me . That is why , after twelve years as a teaching pro , I have returned full-time to the tournament tour with the Ladies Professional Golf Association . " I ca n't understand it , " my mother said , watching me pack my heating pad , cashmere sweaters , bandages and aspirin in preparation for the assault on the pro money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up a secure teaching job for the nerve strain and uncertainty of tournaments . " Tournament golf is n't the snap that some starry-eyed young amateurs like to think . Unlike most of the women pros , who are affiliated with sporting-goods companies , I 'm my own financial backer . In the four months I played tournament golf in 1953 I collected $3750 in prize money . I spent $3225 of it on hotels , meals , tips , airplane tickets , automobile tires , caddies and cab fares . Keeping a golf game sharp enough to pay this high freight rate means forsaking the leisurely enticements of country-club life and putting in plenty of callus-producing hours on the practice tee . It means that home is always a hotel room , wherever a tournament is being played . The circuit will put 90,000 miles on my automobile speedometer in 1954 , 1000 miles on my spiked shoes , and who knows how many new gray hairs under my sun visor . But as 6,000,000 Americans know , golf can he irresistible . Unless the putts stop dropping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address will continue to be " c LPGA Tournament Tour . " My traveling companions and competitors range in size and shape from five-foot-one-inch , 100-pound Alice Bauer Hagge to five-foot-five-inch , 225-pound Jackie Pung . Betty Dodd and Babe Zaharias are specialists in hillbilly music ; Betsy Rawls collects opera records . Peggy Kirk reputedly once lost her comb and did n't unsnarl her hair until Borne charitable galleryite bought her one a week later ; impeccable Betty MacKinnon considers manicures and permanents as important as putting practice . Louise Suggs appears aloof and introverted ; outgoing Marilynn Smith sometimes gets so sociable with the tournament gallery that she forgets to hit her shots . Marlene Bauer has never finished high school ; Betsy Rawls earned a Phi Beta Kappa key at the University of Texas . For this heterogeneous assortment of females to live together in a tensely competitive situation and never raise their voices at one another would be a pacifist 's dream . We do have our squabbles . Louise Suggs leaned over a short putt in a tournament on the Southern tour last winter . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whine and twang of harmonica and guitar came from the clubhouse porch . She yipped on the putt , which is pro parlance for blowing an easy one due to nervous spasms . Suggs burned . Guitar-player Betty Dodd and harmonica-tooter Babe Zaharias apologized , claiming the performance was inadvertent . However accidental the rendition may have been , the putt could not be redeemed . It cost Suggs money , and did little for the Dodd-Zaharias popularity rating with the pros . Babe 's supremacy would he much easier for us to swallow if she did n't cram it down our throats . " Why don'tcha girls all go home ? " Babe has been heard to ask before a tournament started . " Or do you wan na stick around to see who 'll get second money ? " Babe Zaharias demands  --  and gets  --  fees to appear in tournaments , a concession rated by none of the other pros . " She thinks she 's the whole show , " commented Helen Dettweiler , who then quipped , " which , of course , she is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypochondriac , aroused collective ire at Palm Springs last year . Patty 's toe hurt on the morning of the tournament 's second round , Following her customary practice , she rushed to the hospital for treatment . This necessitated a change in the pair ings for the day 's play . It also produced a playing partner for Patty who we knew was more to Patricia Jane 's liking . We hastily organized a caucus and appointed a spokesman , who told Miss Berg , sweetly but firmly , that in the future she would appear on the first tee at the prescribed time , with the prescribed player . Patty pouted and mumbled something about buying a ticket back to Minneapolis . However , the 1953 records show that both her toe and her sensitivity recovered sufficiently for Patty to remain on the tour and win a healthy $18.623.37 for the year . The big names naturally are the most vulnerable to criticism from their contemporaries . There are complaints about spotlight-hogging , appearance-fee demands , special parking privileges , special starting times , quantity and quality of publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find any real enmities among the professionals . Most of the gripes are petty and never foment major conflicts . " My gosh ! " sputtered the sometimes irascible Beverly Hanson , stalled on the course behind a slow player . " It 's great that she 's our personality girl , but let her do it on her own time  --  not mine . " " Well ! " was the locker-room postscript added by another pro . " And does Hanson think she 's a speed demon ? " " Ca n't the autographs wait ? " snapped Betty Jameson in a rare indulgence in petulance , as gallery favorites Alice and Marlene Bauer paused in mid-tournament to sign books for admirers . " This does it ! " said one of the money winners , looking up from the morning sports page . " Berg has now had every disease known to man . " Most of us get amusedly weary hearing of Patty Berg 's aches , bandages , symptoms and pain-killer shots , and reading accounts of how the doddering dean of the circuit dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new course record in the process . The Berg golf reign was threatened several years ago when her left knee met a dashboard in a Texas auto crash . The kneecap was fractured , and the story has been widely circulated that it was doubted that Patty would ever walk again , which makes dramatic copy , but flimsy medical fact . Only thirty-five , Patty still has many peak years ahead of her in golf , according to current . standards . Yet she periodically threatens retirement , protesting that she is constantly developing new aches and pains . Patty is correct when she points out in her retirement announcements that tournaments are a grind . The circuit runs eight or nine months of the . year . The remainder of the time is devoted to instruction clinics and exhibitions by those who work for sporting-goods companies . If the travel is wearing , it is primarily because we never escape our personal chores . Men pros on the tournament trail haul their wives along to tend to washing and ironing , packing and unpacking , shoe shining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladies P.G.A . are our own slaves . Investigate the back of Marilynn Smith 's loaded automobile and you 'll see a steam iron , soap flakes and portable ironing board ? the typical solution of the laundry problem . Betsy Rawls , Louise Suggs and Betty MacKinnon have perfected the assembly-line technique for polishing shoes . And in just about every suitcase you 'll and the equipment for home permanents . Pro schedules permit no time for sitting under driers in beauty shops . " I figure I go through the pack-unpack routine about seventy-five or a hundred times a year , " muses Betsy Rawls . " I kind of get used to it . " We travel by all modern means of transportation , but not with an admirable safety score . Powerful cars , golfers ' heavy feet and the temptation to gulp up the long distances between tournaments have combined to give the pros a deplorable accidentand-ticket record . Betty Dodd and Peggy Kirk have the unenviable distinction of being leaders . Betty was ticketed for speeding in virtually every town on the 1953 winter tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Texas highway early in the spring . Peggy was logically regarded as a poor insurance risk after she had been involved in nine accidents . We were only slightly relieved when Kirk traded her car for an airplane . That she has not carved a plane-sized divot out of a mountain somewhere on the tournament trail is a great tribute to her flying instructors . Betty Jameson and Peg narrowly missed becoming permanent parts of a Florida swamp when their car 's highspeed skid was halted by a tree . " The only tree beside the road , " moaned Peggy . " And we had to hit it . " " Hit it ! " said Betty , whose wild chauffeuring contradicts her personality . " It 's a good thing we did . I 've heard they never do get some cars out of those Florida ditches . " Bev Hanson did better than any of the other pros in one of her crack-ups . Whipping along a New York highway on a summer day in 1952 , she flipped her new , expensive automobile wheels up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ten months later she married Dr. William Silvernail , Jr. , resident surgeon there . Despite our here-today-gone-tomorrow existences , one third of the pros are married . Of the husbands , only Alice Bauer 's Bob Hagge travels constantly with the tour . Bill Silvernail , Barney Pung , Herb Breault , Warren Bell , George Zaharias , Bill Cornelius , Eddie Bush and Lyle Bowman all are reconciled to meeting their spouses occasionally along the trail . Mrs. Barney Pung , far from her native Hawaii , gets homesick . She was lonely and lost when she left her husband , children and family in Honolulu to join the tour in . January of 195:3 . Barney is a fireman , so when Jackie becomes intolerably homesick she visits the nearest fire station . She claims that the sight of the boots lined up against the wall bolsters her morale . " Would n't it be nice , " Jackie kept saying during the 1953 trek , " if I could earn enough mooey to hring Barney over here ? " She did . Barney finally arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively in the All-American and World championships . - Maybe , " she pondered , " now I should try earning enough to send him home . " Most of the single pros admit tedly are keeping one eye on the ball and the other peeled for a likely prospect to lure them from the circuit to the altar . " There 's only one thing that could he more fascinating than golf , " declares Betsy Rawls . " That would be raising children . " " Guess I 've played hard-to-get too tong , " sighs Patty Berg . " Can you imagine spending the rest of your life in golf tournaments ? " once-wed Betty MacKinnon asks . No one can imagine Betty spending the rest of her life in golf tournaments . Betty always commands a retinue of male admirers wherever she plays . The women pros these days have dropped their old-time trade-marks of long strides and sports jackets , and Betty MacKinnon has had a lot to do TI1E SiSl'UnntY with this . No girl in our group has done more to alert the golfers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , both by example and dictum . " But no one else will wear hats and gloves , " protested Betsy Rawls as she and Betty dressed for a tournament recept ion . " Good ! " snapped the Emily Post of the tour . " Then we 'll be the only ones there who are dressed correctly . " We louring pros meet many eligible males in the course of a year 's travels , but it 's difficult to establish lasting relationships during the few days our troupe parks in any one town , Dating is a standard and popular diversion among the single LPGA members . But it is not the only way of disposing of what little leisure is available after the day 's divots are dug . Anyone in the mood for erudite conversation can seek out Betty Jameson or Beverly Hanson . Both read extensively and will discuss any subject from politics to religion to ballet at the drop of a putt . Marilynn Smith and Betty MacKinnon are camera fans . If your mood is for La Bolseme or Grieg 's Piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is available with selections that sun from Hey , Joe , to Rachmaninoff . Or she can lend you a hook . This cultured women 's national open champion reads Mickey Spillane or Durant 's Story of Philosophy with equal fervor . Shows and sight-seeing are leisure-time stand-bys on the tour . Jackie Pung is particularly wide-eyed . Most of America is new to her . Babe Zaharias and Betty Dodd are inveterate gin players , when they 're not whipping up a new rendition of some folk tune . We ca n't classify all cocktail and dinner parties in the entertainment category . Sponsor and club festivities frequently are enjoyable . But six hours of shot making leaves very little energy for dinner dancing . A typical day 's schedule takes us through golf from 9:00 to 5:00. a sponsor cocktail party at 5:30 , a club dinner at 7:00 , a television commitEVENING POST ment , at 9:30 , and thence back to a hotel room to iron a shirt , shine shoes , curl hair , manicure nails , and get eight hours ' sleep to face the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of late hours , second cocktails and unbalanced diets . Such young champions as Betsy Rawls and Marilynn Smith shun coffee , cigarettes and alcohol entirely . Good physical condition is a necessity , unless you want the parade to pass you . There are more than a dozen highly skilled professionals who play every tournament on the circuit each year . Headlining these regulars are Betsy Rawls , Patty Berg , Louise Suggs , Babe Zaharias , Betty Jameson and Jackie Pung . Babe Zaharias is Mrs. Golf . She 's the big drawing card . None of us can match her as " the woman athlete of the half century . " We ca n't compete with her in color . Even though she annoys us at times with her egocentric attitude , we have twice elected her president of our association . We grin at her antics , tolerate her demands for favors from sponsors , sincerely wish her speedy recoveries from illness , lake our beatings from her routinely  --  and thoroughly enjoy heating her . Fortunately for golf , she has not dominated our sport as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every tournament . And she reluctantly shares the game 's most important records with her sister pros . The low single-round scoring mark of 64 belongs to pudgy Patty Berg . This record , set in the Richmond Open in California in 1952 , has never been seriously threatened in competition , even by Babe . Measured by the yardstick of tournaments won , Patty is a better golfer than Mrs. Zaharias . Ask the pros who is our greatest shot maker . We 'll tell you it 's Patty Berg . Pat has tremendous gallery appeal in addition to her unapproachable victory list . Her feet have a right to hurt . She has walked 25,000 miles around golf courses in the past quarter of a century . She has an almost masochistic devotion to clinic and exhibition duty . J./usury 2.3 , 1951 At limes Patty seems a tragically lonely individual , with no love but golf . She plays the game intensely , fervently  --  and much better than most of us . Louise Suggs ' record comes close to matching Patty 's . But Louise is five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swhich helps draw attention to skill . Louise is an intelligent , straight-dealing Southerner , a favorite among the pros as a playing partner . She is also a stern golfing mechanism . She set the all-time record in the women 's national open in 1952 with a Fantastic four-round score of 284 , and she was the leading money winner among the women pros in 1953 with a take of $19,816.25 , also a record . Twenty-five-year-old Betsy Rawls is the youngest of our headliners . This native of South Carolina has played golf for only eight years , three of them as a professional . Yet she has twice won the national open , and was the leading money winner for the 1952 campaign with $14,685 . There is n't a young player in sight who can match this honor student in physical , emotional and intellectual equipment . Unless she meets her man , which is more than likely , Betsy Rawls will surely be the No. 1 star of the circuit in the years ahead . Intelligent. , soft-spoken Betty Jameson , whose competitive experiences date back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American golf title for which she has been eligible . Betty is appropriately introduced at LPGA clinics as " the lady from San Antonio . " She plays tournament golf because she enjoys it as an aesthetic performance , like ballet  --  a philosophy she defends enthusiastically and demonstrates gracefully . Jackie Pung , the hula specialist who won the 1952 national amateur while training on chocolate sundaes , finished as fourth money winner in 1953 , her initial year on the professional tour . Humble , considerate and grateful for her break in golf , Jackie Pung has built a sincere fan Following . These top-rungers are supported more than adequately by the balance of the cast . The sisters Bauer are the subjects of more questions from the curious than any of the other touring pros except Babe . " What has happened to the Bauers ? " is easy to answer . The fact is that the Bauerscute , personable and unspoiled as they are  --  never were great golfers , if one lines their records up against those of true topnotchers . They have been smartly managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far exceeded their skill as golfers . Neither Alice nor Marlene appears to have any considerable zest for the game at the present . Alice is blissfully united to Bob Hagge , ex-Purdue basketball player , a lovable giant who is genuinely popular with his spouse 's sister pros . Quiet little Marlene appears bored with golf , and frequently is . Papa Bauer has been roundly criti-cized , in public print and private conversation , for his exploitation of his daughters . However , they are independent youngsters , and one has the feeling that either or both will do as they please , when the time is ripe . The time-ripening might be hastened i by such incidents as the prize presentation at a recent tournament . Marlene plucked off last money , Upon receipt of the check , she dutifully presented it to papa . " Humph , " grunted the little man , after a squint at the slim pay-off . " Is that the best you can do ? " Marilynn Smith , the Kansas sunflower whom Bing Crosby names along with Betty MacKinnon as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador . A friendly and attractive youngster , she is one of the most popular pros with galleries . Bright . Bev Hanson Silvernail is the possessor of the troupe 's sharpest sense of humor . If she could overcome the distressing habit of flubbing pulls measuring one to twelve inches , she would make more money to furnish her honeymoon cottage . Bev clings to Hanson as her career name , registering variously out of Fargo , North Dakota , and Pasadena , California . Screwball Peg Kirk is small time in the prize winnings , but big time as a businesswoman . She is part owner of a North Carolina golf course , owns a tilling station hack home in Findlay , Ohio , and claims a partnership in a Kentucky driving range  --  plus full ownership of Warren Bell , whom she married last . August . Betty Dodd is another of the many Texans on the tour . This lantern-jawed redhead has been a pro but a short lime . She helped to spur her tutor , Babe Zaharias , into a comeback after Babe 's cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breaks into the pay-off column frequently . Betty MacKinnon is another asset to the tour , not only for her decorative value but also because she is capable of hitting tine golf shots . There are other capable professionals who play occasional tournaments , although they have jobs that keep them from being regular competitors . Helen Dettweiler , an excellent player and a long-time pro , has a lucrative teaching position at Thunderbird Country Club , in Palm Springs , California . Shirley Spork , former intercollegiate champion , is manager , pro and greens-keeper at the municipal course in Ukiah , California . Bonnie Randolph , Frances Mahoney , Mice Kirby , Ann Breault , Sally Sessions and Barbara Ransom all are instruction and merchandising specialists , with tournaments their side tine . The newest LPGA members are Kathy Cornelius , Carol Bowman and Lesbia Lobo , endeavoring to establish themselves as teachers or players . Most of the players who make the full circuit either have sporting-goodscompany affiliation or lucrative backing from other sources . Many of I he girls travel first cabin on expense accounts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of young amateurs eager to become pros themselves . However , the LPGA is not recruiting . Instead , we discourage amateurs from turning pro unless they first have definite tie-ups which will meet their expenses . The competition today is such that it is increasingly difficult for a girl to win enough prize money to pay her way . Ten years ago fi score of 77 or 78 was a good round for a woman . This quality of hacking generally leaves a present-day LPGA member at the bottom of the payroll . In 1953 Patty Berg led the scoring averages with 75.00 for sixty-nine rounds . Louise Suggs followed with 75.11 . However , although an LPGA team did whip an embarrassed group of top British men amateurs on their home ground three years ago , we 'll never compete on an equal basis with men professionals . Our tournament director , Fred Corcoran , admits , " You and I will never live to see the day when women corn pete against men as pros . They can hold their own with the men on putts but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they just do n't have the strength to compete on equal terms . " Yet many galleryites would rather watch the women play than follow the siege-gun males . We play more as the plays , hitting drives for average man similar distances . Most men can get more pointers for their own Arita by watching us , as we are dependent upon finesse for our low scoring . Not all comment on the women pros has been laudatory . We 've been slapped down here and there by newsmen , usually because a top name failed to show for a tournament or because someone refused to appear on a midnight television show . But fortunately , the comments of a Reading , Pennsylvania , sports writer , Bill Reedy , are more typical . He wrote : " Strange as it may seem , they spread far less temperament over a course than do most of the prima-donnish males on the PGA circuit . They de-mand less awe from the galleryites who pay the freight . They waste much less time in going about the business of addressing and smacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a real pleasure to watch them . They lack only the power-hitting of the males . " A sporting-goods-company execu-tive , who obviously must be shielded by anonymity , commented , " Not only do the girls behave better than the but what 's more , the clinic men pros , they present at tournaments is better than that given by the men . " We felt that we had come of age as an organization when the United States Golf Association assumed sponsorship of our national open . Fred Corcoran receives more requests for our other tournaments than he has dates open . Communities , civic organizations , club groups arid individual businessmen seem anxious to sponsor the events . Our one remaining objective is to increase the prize money at each stop . Clothing manufacturer Alvin Handl/lather gave the women 's pro circuit a boost when he inaugurated the Weathervane cross-country tournament . This event features four thirty-six-hole week-end competitions in various sections of the country , with $3000 in prizes at each stop and a $5000 grand prize for low scorer for the 144 holes . Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe for golf courses , sponsored a $7500 Triangle Invitational round robin last summer in New Jersey . Spurred by an enthusiastic reception from both the pros and the galleries , McAuliffe has promised something bigger and better for 1954 . Tam O'Shanter 's George May is a long-time women's-open sponsor . Mention of his name brings mixed reactions from the pros . Famous for his loose purse strings and tight dictatorship , May behaves like a businessman on the brink of bankruptcy when the pay-off for the women comes around . Although he puts up a $1.2,500 kitty in the women 's division of his so-called World Championship , the total prize money for his preceding event , the seventy-two-hole All-American Women 's Championship , is an anemic $3200 , despite the fact that LPGA rules set the minimum for a four-day tournament at $5000 . Relationships with sponsors occasionally raise problems . " Some sponsors figure they own us , " pointed out one player . " Look at this wire I just got . ' You will appear on a television program at nine P. M. ' Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Wonder if it has occurred to him that I might already have other plans for the evening . " All of us are mindful of our obligations to sponsors and the press . But we draw the line on appearances which threaten our efficiency as golfers . Neither do we intend to spend our professional careers salaaming to officials , sponsors and newspapermen . We know we owe a great deal to people like George May , whatever differences we may have with him . May was one of the pioneers in backing women 's opens . His first tournament was in 1943 , when a handful of us career-girl golfers were competing in only three or four events each year , for prize money which barely covered caddie fees and the price of a victory milk shake . Last year we shot at a total of $100,000 in twenty-three tournaments ! There are several reasons for this boom . One is what is loosely known as our professional organization . The original Women 's Professional Golfers Association was incorporated in 1944 . I was president , by default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the outfit was Hope Seignious , a North Carolina professional who initiated the first national women 's open in 1946 . Hope also negotiated two more national events for us in 1947 and 1948 , along with several tournaments for lesser purses and prestige in Florida cities . Although our membership increased , our treasury did n't . Then the individual desires of self-interested golf stars collided head on . The WPGA disintegrated violently in March of 1947 . A benevolent group of golf-equipment manufacturers decided to keep the showcase of women 's golf in business . They all chipped in and hired Fred Corcoran , a seasoned sports promoter , to hustle a tournament tour for us . Exhumed in the venture was the professional association . This time we called it the Ladies Professional Golf Association , as though a strip of lace on the title might guarantee a more tranquil existence . Meetings of the LPGA invariably produce mild pyrotechnics . Until recently , rules of order were not considered essential in the conduct of meetings . A public stenographer hired to render minutes of one session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commented Bev Hanson dryly . " There were so many motions on the floor at the same time I got seasick . " There has been other evidence that the association was in want of an efficiency expert . We had long been told we were incorporated in New York ; investigation revealed that the secretary of that state had never heard of us . Minutes to previous meetings have disappeared . Last July , Bet ty Jameson matter-of-factly advised us that the bylaws which had presumably been in effect had never been approved . Treasurer Betty MacKinnon , who made LPGA history by establishing a set of books which balanced , was found to be illegally in office . The crisis which brought the state of confusion into a semblance of organization was the news that the golf-equipment manufacturers were dropping their financial support of the LPGA to pour funds into more pressing projects as of January , 1954 . We rallied to the cause . Someone produced a copy of Mr. Robert 's Rules of Order , and LPGA motions now enjoy a proper life cycle . Raised voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one person talks at a time , a remarkable innovation . And Betty MacKinnon was unanimously and legally elected treasurer last August in Chicago , along with the other officers . Even without financial aid from the golf manufacturers , we are optimistic about the future . Our tournament schedule is jammed . All over the country more women are playing golf , inspired at least in part by the collective and individual promotional work our pros are doing . Eighteen women professionals are on the staffs of nine sporting-goods companies . Their average income is up to $15,000 annually . If I am ever tempted to complain about the strain of tournaments and the woes of traveling , I remember the poor girls back home , slaving over hot stoves and cold typewriters . And then I know how lucky I am to own a golf swing that will keep me going on the LPGA circuit . Because I like this golf game . I enjoy the places our tournaments are played , the people who sponsor them and the pros who play them . And I like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our 1954 jack pot has my name on it !
