ARMED FORCES Extra Duty General James A. Van Fleet had-in the opinion of his West Point Classmate Dwight Eisenhower-the best World War II combat record of " any regimental , division or corps commander we produced . " On his recent visit to Korea , Eisenhower chatted with Van Fleet about his retirement , due this January ; Van Fleet decided to put it off . There remained one hitch : for Van Fleet to remain on active duty , he needed the approval of Army Secretary Frank Pace Jr. , who did not relish the fact that a Van Fleet letter criticizing Administration military policy had been used by Ike in his campaign . <P> Last week Secretary Pace named two generals who would stay on active duty two months beyond their scheduled retirements at the age of 60 . The two : Lieut . General Manton S. Eddy , commander in chief , U.S. Army , Europe-and Van Fleet .
