txt Legislative outcome of Governor Furcolo 's withholding-tax proposal is still obscure . Still in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate Committee on Ways and Means , the Furcolo-revived measure is likely to remain there for some time if Senator Ralph C. Mahar ( R ) of Orange , committee chairman , has his way . Senator Mahar today expressed conviction that there is no need for hurry on the controversial plan , once killed by the Senate by a 25-to-15 vote earlier this year , only to be revived by a Furcolo message . The Ways and Means Cornmittecchairman did not dispute the need for 15 to 17 million dollars to balance the $405,573 , - 661 state budget already approved . But he still questions that the withholding tax is the best method of producing that revenue . Long an advocate of the sales tax , he realizes that a sales tax is almost impossible in an election year . Therefore , he has suggested upping the surtax on income from 23 to 30 per cent to produce 13 to 15 million dollars in extra revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance the budget , even with a later modest supplementary budget . Furcolo Victory Seen He said that increasing the surtax on income from 23 to 30 per cent would mean only $7 extra for the taxpayer whose basic tax amounts to $100 . However , many observers believe it will be difficult to sell an income-tax increase to a majority of the Senate and House . Yet if the withholding tax is killed again by the Senate , the administration must come up with some other tax plan or renew the withholding-tax. issue by still another special message . Second rejection of the withholding tax undoubtedly would lead to a long battle of maneuver between the Governor and the Republican-controlled Senate over how to finance the budget deficit . ? Of course , as a last resort the deficit could be levied on the cities and towns under a state tax . But this budget-balancing device , once an annual affair , has not been used since 1947 . The trend has been toward tax aid for the cities and towns rather than toward a resumption of a state tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some quarters to believe that Governor Furcolo will win the withholding tax on the second round . However , others are not so sure . Senator Mahar said he had surveyed Senate members and had seen no evidence of any major shift to its support since the 25-to-15 vote against it . On the other hand , when the latter vote was taken , several senators indicated they would vote against the withholding tax until it was proved , that the budget needed the withholding-tax revenue to balance it . The budget is now law and it is at least 15 to 17 million dollars out of balance , according to fiscal experts . Windfall Env iAinned The Governor is counting on a 17-million-dollar one-year windfall from the withholding tax to balance the budget for the current fiscal year . But the windfall would be for the 1959 fiscal year only . The gap would have to be filled by some other tax the following year . In addition , the withholding tax would give the cities and towns a 37-million-dollar windfall the first year of operation because of overlapping payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way to make up that amount in the following year when the windfall would not be available . Factors in favor of a withholding tax this year are : ( 1 ) the fact that the budget is definitely out of balance and considerable extra revenue is needed and ( 2 ) the patronage powers available to the Governor for pressure purposes . Expense Cited In addition , it is expected municipal officers from many localities will exert pressure on legislators for passage because of the municipal revenue windfall feature . Also the withholding tax would close loopholes through which many persons are still avoiding the income tax . On the other side is the Mahar contention that the withholding tax would be administratively too expensive for the amount of additional permanent revenue to be realized beyond the windfall period . Still potent , too , is the argument that in the first year of withholding , the taxpayer would be paying two years ' taxes in one . In 1959 he would be paying in full his taxes due on 1958-earned income and in the same year he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tax road this year is still long and rough . What the end will produce remains to be seen . '
