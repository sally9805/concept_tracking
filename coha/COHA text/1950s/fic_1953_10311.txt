THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGBut Uncle Myron laughed and calmed him down . " My God , he 's worrying again ! I never saw such a worrier ! Who said he would n't be agreeable ? I was just giving you an appreciation of what a tough job it 'll be  --  I was n't saying I could n't do it . Believe me , when the day comes that I ca n't wrap at least three Manny Feldspans around my little finger , that 's the day I quit the underwear business and move into the Old People'sHome ! " Then he leaned forward and yelled at the chauffeur , " All right , whosis , get out of the park and take Mr. Kramer home ! " Ten minutes later they pulled up to the dull green awning in front of Norman 's building . With more thanks and more promises , and the understanding that he would see Uncle Myron promptly after dinner tonight , Norman climbed out of the car and started into the building . But not before Uncle Myron had stuck his head out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's sake , my boy , will you take it easy and do n't fall into a conniption fit ! Believe me , when you get so old as I am , you 'll realize that nothing in this world is worth a conniption fit . " THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING21 GOING UP IN THE SELF-SERVICE ELEVATOR , Norman polished his glasses slowly and absently . Bits and pieces of what Uncle Myron had said to him still sounded in his ears . " You 're making an old man out of yourself . " Yes , he could n't deny it . It was n't very pleasant to hear somebody accuse him of it right out like that  --  especially somebody from the family  --  but he could n't deny that the same thought had occurred to him more than once lately . He was getting old , and he was getting tired  --  working late at the office was harder and harder for him , his appetite was n't what it used to be , his stomach was sour when he woke up in the morning , his eyes ached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at thirty-two he had all the ailments of an old man . And what was the reason for it ? No reason , no reason at all . His life was n't any worse now than it had been ten years before . On the contrary , many things were much easier now , and as for the ones that were n't , well , you 'd think he would have got over being bothered by them . From any reasonable , logical point of view , his position at thirty-two was a considerable improvement over his position at twenty-two . And so he forced him-d22 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGself now to tick off the improvements , one by one , in his mind : One . At twenty-two he was n't making the money he was making today . He was just out of college , he had spent his whole life up to then in an expensive apartment , accustomed to getting money by asking his father for it , looking forward to law school and a sober , safe , untroubled future in his father 's firm . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norman was absolutelyunprepared  --  no practical training , no experience in a job , no way of earning his living . Law school , of course , was out . Whatever money there was , he had to devote it to getting Leo started at college and keeping Mother reconciled ( as much as she ever would be ) to their new conditions . Of course , the family was very nice  --  Uncle Myron sent Norman through that CPA course , Aunt Ruth gave Mother her old mink coat , and so on  --  but still it was a terrible struggle . Today , on the other hand , he was earning a comfortable salary , and if there were still money problems , they were n't anything like ten years ago . Two . He was more experienced now than he had been in the early days . He knew all about budgets and bills and spreading his income even . He did n't make foolish mistakes any more  --  how could he , after all those days poring over other people 's account books , and all those nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were occasionally some special , unforeseen expenses  --  like Mother suddenly deciding that she could n't go to her lecture without a new hat , or like Leo , with one of his difficulties  --  well , they did n't catch Norman so much by surprise any more . He could take them in his stride almost  --  he could calculate pretty accurately just how many extra evenings at the office they would cost him . Three . After ten years , he was used to it all . He was n't a bewildered little college boy any more , still holding on to vague thoughts of law school , still giving himself up to daydreams in which everything that had happened somehow turned out not to have happened at all . Most of all , he did n't waste his time any more in absurd discussions of " the future " with earnest , impressionable girls who might misunderstand . He was free of that foolishness now . He was a realistic practical man , and he knew all about " the future . " The elevator jarred to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his senses  --  to the sense of smell mainly . The hall on his floor was filled , like all the other halls in the building , like the lobby , like the elevator itself , with the smell of cooking . What kind of cooking ? After ten years in this building , Norman still could n't identify it positively . It was a sort of anonymoussmell that seemed to contain something of all the24 THE **28;7331;TOOLONG concoctions , all the oatmeal and cabbage and beef stew and spaghetti , that had been cooked and recooked and warmed over since the building was built . Why was it , Norman often asked himself , that this smell was restricted exclusively to this kind of building , in this kind of neighborhood , full of old ladies with their unmarried daughters , retired clothing merchants living on their insurance , and dentists with large families ? Why was it that you never smelled this smell farther downtown , over on the East Side , in the halls and elevators , for example , of the Park Avenue apartment house where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he asked himself this question , Norman felt a little ashamed of himself . Thoughts like that , they made him sound bitter and envious  --  like Uncle Myron 's old school friend , Eli Spitzer , who was a failure in the dress business , so he went around saying that all successful businessmen were crooks . If he had n't been so tired and upset , Norman would never have let himself think such thoughts . What he needed was to have his talk with Leo , to get it off his mind and take a nap before dinner . He opened the door to the apartment and stepped into the dark little foyer . Right away Mother 's voice called out from the living room : " Who 's that ? Is that you , Norman dear ? " THE GOOD-'F OR-NOTHING 25Norman paused for a moment in the foyer to shake off his gloominess and put a smile on his face ; then he walked into the living room . Mother was at the desk , of course , writing letters . That was how Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing lettersand more letters to distant relations , cultural organizations , magazines that printed articles she liked , famous celebrities , and Heaven knows who else . It alwaysdepressed Norman a little , to think of all those words , all that ink , pouring out of Mother 's pen day after day , flooding the whole world , so to speak . But he must n't let himself feel depressed , he must n't let Mother notice a thing . " You 're late , dear , " she said , without looking up at him as he kissed her . " Where have you been all afternoon ? Down at your dreary old office , I suppose . Oh Norman dear , you worry me sometimes . Do n't you know the proverb , all work and no play  --  ? " " Where 's Leo ? " Norman said . " He 's in his room . But do n't disturb him , he 's taking a nap . Poor boy , he got ' home so late from the club last night , and you know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get up the next morning . All right , Norman thought , it can wait till after dinner . To tell the truth , he was n't sorry for the delay . He was so tired now , he was in no condition for a scene. 26 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGHe sank into his easy chair and scanned the evening paper , while Mother went chattering on about some movie she 'd seen last night . " Oh you should have come along , " she said . " It was just lovely , I cried all the way . All about a girl who 's going blind , and her husband is in love with another woman , and her father is in jail , and there 's all sorts of interesting information about the meat-packing business . Really , with all the suffering and unhappiness in the world , it 's so nice when they can make you cry over it and educate you at the same time . " For a while Mother 's voice was just a drone in Norman'sears , and for the first time all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last long . The colored girl came into the room to set up the card table for dinner , and right away Uncle Myron 's words popped into Norman'shead . " Does this discourage her from keeping a cook for dinners , which is more than you can afford out of your salary ? " It was true . Norman hated this thought  --  he fought against it immediately with all the familiarphrases about poor Mother going through so much , and living in a world of her own , and how hard it is for people who always had money to get along without it . God knows , the last thing in the world he wanted her to do was to wear herself out cooking meals or doing housework . And yet , it was true . They could n't afford a dining room , they could n't even afTHEGOOD-FOR-NOTHING 27ford a dining room table  --  but every night their dinner was made for them and served to them by a hired cook . In uniform , too  --  Mother was very particular about the uniform ! And anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , it would n't have done any good . He had tried it once . Just as gently and diplomatically as could be , he had suggested to her that maybe , if she could only do without the cook three or four nights a week , say  --  but for a long time she had n't understood what he was saying , she 'd just smiled up at him and blinked her eyes . And then , when she did understand , her chin trembled , a tear rolled down her cheek , and she began to tell him what a selfish egotistical mother she was , thinking only of her own silly affairs , neglectingher home and her children  --  In the end , Normanhad to spend an hour apologizing to her , telling her he was only fooling , and thinking up arguments against firing the cook . That was over seven years ago ... and he never brought up the subject again . He was glad when the colored girl finished setting the table and announced that dinner was ready . " Dinner ! Dinner ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bustling out to the foyer . " Dinner , Leo dear ! Oh Leo , can you hear me ? Time for dinner ! " A few minutes later Leo appeared . He was yawning , his eyes were still red , but his manner was just as28 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGlively as ever . He waved at Norman and cried out , " Where you been all afternoon , Normie ? Now do n't give me that office gag . Leading a double life ! Keeping a couple of chorus girls downtown ! " While Norman reddened and mumbled an answer , Leo went striding up to Mother . " Why , Countess , you look stunning tonight ! Would you grant me the honor and the privilege of kissing your hand ? " Mother laughed and squirmed , but Leo made a sweeping bow and kissed her hand . Then he straightened up and took her by the arm . " And now , my dear Countess , at the risk of a challenge from the Count , allow me to escort you in to dinner . " " Oh Leo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " But Leo played the act out until he had Mother seated . Then he took his own seat and . tore into his soup . All through the meal he was in the highest spirits  --  just as if nothing were wrong , Norman thought , just as if there were no such thing on earth as a West Side Pinochle , Gin Rummy , and Whist Club , or a House Committee , or a Manny Feldspan . He told jokes and laughed at them heartily . He complimented Mother on the food  --  " I 've always said it , Countess , you 've got the best chef on three continents . Why , the Archdukehimself was remarking to me  --  " He teased theTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 29colored girl about her boy friend until she nearly dropped the baked potatoes from giggling . He gave imitations of people they knew  --  Mrs. Peterman across the hall , the family doctor , Aunt Ruth  --  and he was so good at it that Norman even caught himself smiling , in spite of his resolution to remain properly serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And of course , Norman himself came in for his share of Leo 's humor . " What a long face you 've got tonight , Normiel And probably all that happened was , you misplaceda decimal point at the office . You know , you worry me sometimes  --  one of these days you 'll try to smile , and you 'll find out you 've forgotten how . " Norman turned off Leo 's remarks as best he could with a mumble , a vague grin , or a request for the butter . It was hard to resent them , these little . jokes of Leo 's . The tone in which he said them was so easygoing and affectionate  --  you felt that he meant so little harm by them , no matter how much harm he happened to do . Still , Norman wished that Leo would leave him alone , because he knew what this particular line of kidding must inevitably lead to . And sure enough , during the dessert , it happened . Mother turned to Norman with a look of concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listless and unenthusiastic . I 've been noticing it more and more lately . All you seem to think about is money and work30 T H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N Gand the material things of life . Why ca n't you be gay and lighthearted and cheerful , like Leo ? " Norman could n't count the number of times that Mother had put him through this little scene  --  but still it was as painful and humiliating to him as if it had never happened before . " I do n't know why , Mother , " he said . " If you could pass the sugar  --  " " Well , at least you 'll make an effort , wo n't you , dear ? Promise me you 'll make an effort to be more like Leo . " " Yes . I promise . " " Well ! That 's all I ask ! " And Mother smiled and patted him on the cheek . At the end of the meal , Leo got to his feet , stretched himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , I hate to tear myself away from this tender domestic atmosphere , but I 've got a hot date tonight , and it would n't be kind to the poor girl to stand her up " " I 'm going out tonight too , " Norman said . " I 'll go down with you , Leo . " " No need to hurry yourself , Normie . If you feel like resting up after dinner  --  I know how it is with you middle-aged executives  --  " " No , I 'll go down with you , " Norman said . " I 'd like a word with you anyway . " And he accompanied his words with a solemn look . Leo looked back at him sharply for a split second . T H E G O O D- F O R- N O THIN G 31Then he laughed and clapped Norman on the back . A few minutes later they all moved out to the hall , and Norman kissed Mother on the cheek , and Leo hugged her and told her not to wait up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't anyway ! "  --  and a moment later the brothers were riding down in the elevator . " Good old Mother ! " Leo said . " If only they were all such big pushovers ! What a wonderful world it would be  --  am I right , Normie ? " Out in the street Leo began to wave at taxicabs . " Hate to run off like this , " he said . " But I am in a hurry  --  " " But I said I wanted a word with you , Leo . " " Oh yes . Well , ca n't it wait till the morning , Normie  --  at breakfast maybe ? You know how these things are . " Norman was about to insist  --  and then he stopped himself . Maybe it would be better to wait . At least untilthis matter with Mr. Feldspan was cleared up . Certainlyhe 'd be able to give Leo a much more effective talking-to if Mr. Feldspan was off his mind . And anyway , his thoughts would be clearer in the morning  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're not up on time , I 'm going to wake you . " " Not up on time ? Why , you know me ! Regular early bird  --  ca n't wait to get at those worms ! " A cab pulled up , and Leo clapped Norman on the back32 T H E GOOD - FOR - N O T H I N Gagain . " Can I drop you anywhere ? Well then , I 'll be saying so long . Have a nice evening  --  do n't do anything I would n't do . " With one foot in the cab , Leo turned suddenly and flashed one of his most cheerful smiles . " My God , am I a dope ! Here I am , with a hot date on my hands , and do you know what I forgot to do ? I completely forgot to cash my usual week-end check  --  " " Oh , yes . Yes , of course , " Norman said , reaching into his pocket. 3HALF AN HOUR LATER , WHEN AUNT RUTH 'S maid opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Feldspan was there yet . The maid told him that Mr. Feldspan was n't , and Norman shook his head sadly . This meant that in another minute he would have to go through the usual bawling-out from Aunt Ruth . She was waiting for him in the long , high-ceilinged living room , sitting up very straight and stiff and forbiddingin her easy chair . She was just like a society lady out of a Hollywood movie . . . in fact , Norman suspected sometimes that she studied the latest movies for the effect . THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 33 " Good evening ! " she barked out at him in her shrill sharp voice  --  and as usual , whether he had done anything wrong or not , Norman felt guilty . He bent down to kiss her , and she accepted his kiss coldly . Then he shook hands with Uncle Myron , who was stretched out on the sofa . Then he went to a chair and perched himself on the edge of it , and Aunt Ruth started right in . " Well , well ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you any reasonable explanation ? I 'm sure you do n't . My entire adult life I 've been trying to pound a little sense into these Kramers , I 've been trying to make them behave like slightly intelligent , self-respecting humanbeings  --  Do n't interrupt me , please ! " ( It was the farthest thing in the world from Norman 's thoughts . ) " All my life , I said ! And I have yet to see any signs of success ! Congenital idiots when I married into the family , and congenital idiots to this very day ! Well , well , explain yourself ! What are you sitting there gaping for ? One minute he talks too much , the next minute he does n't talk at all ! " Norman was paralyzed by this outburst . He could n't say a word . But Uncle Myron came gently to his rescue . " You know , Ruth , every idiot 's got a right to his idiocy . It 's a free country . " " Oh it is , is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , well . Very interesting . " Aunt Ruth took a dee THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGbreath and turned to Norman again . He could see that she was preparing to unleash a tremendous explosion , and he trembled a little . But just then he was miraculouslysaved  --  the doorbell rang . " That 's Manny Feldspan , " Uncle Myron said . " Betteryou should be quiet , Ruth . Remember , a solid family front . " Aunt Ruth leaned forward and treated Norman to a loud , fierce whisper . " I 'll deal with you later ! " " I 'm sorry , Aunt Ruth , " Norman managed to stammerout . " You 'll be sorrier later ! " And she straightened up , stiff and dignified again . The maid passed by the living room archway on her way to the front door , and Norman could n't help dartinga panicky little look at Uncle Myron . " It 's going to be all right , I hope . I mean  --  Mr. Feldspan is n't really such a difficult man , is he , Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take it easy , do n't turn somersaults , " Uncle Myron said , as he swung himself up to a sitting position . " Maybe you better let me do all the talking . You 're too anxious , my boy . The one way to make sure that Manny Feldspan do n't give you what you want is to let him know that you really want it . " At that moment the maid appeared and announced Mr. Feldspan . He was a little man with a bald head , a pink roundTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 35face and a belligerent chin . Every time Norman had run into him  --  playing cards at the club , walking along the street , taking a smoke during the intermissionat a musical comedy  --  he acted as if he were in a terrible hurry ; he snapped out his words from the side of his mouth , consulted his watch , and glanced over his shoulder at regular intervals . And this , strangely enough , was a trait that Norman had noticed in a great many men of Mr. Feldspan 's height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Feldspan snapped out , before he even shook anybody 's hand or said hello . " And I only got two minutes . Two minutes on the dot , no more , no less . My chauffeur is downstairs , doubleparked , and I got a train to catch . How are you , Nor-man ? " Norman nodded his head and acknowledged the greeting . Somehow , in spite of himself , he could n't take his eyes off Mr. Feldspan 's nose . It was sort of long  --  it was very long indeed  --  and with a sinking sensationin his stomach , he remembered what Uncle Myron had told him about Mr. Feldspan 's brother Sid and the comical valentine card . " Sit down , Manny , " Uncle Myron was saying . " Take a load off . We 'll talk in comfort . " Mr. Feldspan gave a brisk shake of his head . " No time to sit down , Myron . No time for comfort . " He planted his feet apart and folded his arms over his36 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGchest , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Come to the point  --  and I might as well warn you beforehand , and also save you the energy ; if this is what I think it is , the answer is no ! " It 's hopeless , Norman thought ; why bother to go on with it even ? But Uncle Myron did n't seem the least bit perturbed . He just smiled , a quiet , sly sort of smile . " So , so ? " he said . " Now are n't you being maybe a little hasty , Manny ? " Mr. Feldspan 's face did n't get any less belligerent as he answered this charge . " Who 's being hasty ? I 'm never hasty . Quick decisions , straight to the point , yes . Hasty , no . Ask anybody in my office . And you want to know what the point is right now ? The point is , if there 's one thing in this world I do n't stand for , it 's a man that cheats in a card game . Anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little when his wife is out of town  --  all right , this is only human nature , all 's fair in love and war . A man that occasionally pulls off a business deal which maybe is n't absolutely as legitimateas it could be  --  all right , this is business ; if you are n't willing to take a few extra risks you should n't go into business in the first place . A man that off and on , now and then , does a little maneuveringwith his income tax  --  all right , what else is an income tax blank for ? It 's a game , like a crossword puzzle . But a man that cheats in a card game  --  this isTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 37where I draw the line . I got my honor , I got my integrity , I do n't like cheaters in card games . Especially  --  " " But Mr. Feldspan , " Norman burst out , " Leo is n't really a cheater . Please let me explain  --  " " Quiet , quiet already , " said Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctantly subsided . " Especially , " Mr. Feldspan went on , as if there had n't been any interruption , " when I 'm the one that gets cheated . You follow me ? It 's not the money that I 'm worried about . I can afford the money . Between you and me , I make it all back playing in honest games . And it 's not the reputation of the club that I 'm worried about . If the club gets a reputation for being full of swindlers and cheaters and cardsharps , this is no skin off my nose  --  all I have to do is join a different club . As a matter of fact , it 's not even my friends and fellow members , whether they get cheated or not , that I 'm worried about . My friends should be able to look out for themselves , they should be able to hold on to their own money , otherwise I do n't want them for friends . So it 's none of these items that I 'm worried about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around the room for a moment , and then brought it out : " It 's the principle of the thing . More important to me than any other personal , selfish interestsis the principle of the thing . I do n't like nobody to make a sucker out of me , that 's a principle I 'll stick38 T H E G O O D- F O R- N O T H I N Gto as long as I live ! " And with a sharp little nod of his head , Mr. Feldspan came to a stop . After a pause , in his quiet conversational tone Uncle Myron said , " Are you finished , Manny ? " " Almost . I only want to say  --  if you did n't get the idea already  --  Wednesday afternoon , when the House Committee has its regular monthly meeting , it 's going to give me the greatest pleasure to throw the book at Leo Kramer , and get him kicked out of the club so hard that maybe no other club in New York City would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up too much of my time already . Good night ! " And he turned around and took a step towards the archway . " Mr. Feldspan , wait ! " Norman cried , getting to his feet . " Just a second , Manny , " Uncle Myron said . He motionedNorman into his seat again , then turned back to Mr. Feldspan . " Before you go running off , maybe I could say a few words that would change your mind . " " You could n't , " Mr. Feldspan said . " All right , so maybe I could try it anyhow . " Uncle Myron gave an innocent little smile . " Can you shoot a man in the leg for trying ? " Mr. Feldspan shrugged . " So try . " " Only a few words , Manny . Just one or two words , after that I 'll shut up . " Uncle Myron leaned backT H E G O O D - F O R- N O T H I N G 39and clasped his hands together comfortably over his stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you got your principles and your integrity and so on , this was very interesting to me . This I was very pleased to listen to . " " Glad to hear it . " Mr. Feldspan looked at his watch . " But what 's so remarkable about it after all ? " Uncle Myron suddenly spread his arms out wide and beamed happily . " Is there a decent hard-working businessman in the United States of America that would n't get pleasurefrom such beautiful sentiments ? What do you think ? " " How do I know ? I 'm no authority . Personally I do n't care about nobody else . " " Well , there is n't , Manny . Take my word for it , there is n't . " Uncle Myron allowed just the slightest of pauses before he went on , in the same pleasant tone of voice . " Especially when these beautiful sentiments are expressed by a man that used to think so different about things . " Mr. Feldspan 's forehead creased . " How 's that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uncle Myron said , " can you imagine , Manny , how much stronger I feel , having known you for thirty years  --  known you intimately  --  done business with you  --  observed your progress along the road to success ?

And maybe "  --  Uncle Myron 's smile was so innocent by now that it was practically angelic  --  " maybe even a few steps that you did n't realize I knew about . " Mr. Feldspan cocked his head forward a little . " Excuseme ? " " Like I was saying . " Uncle Myron leaned back and clasped his hands over his stomach again . " I 've observed your progress along the road to success . I 've been honored and privileged to get a peek into what I might call the depths of your character .

In the middle of World War Number Two . I see a certain contract for naval officers ' shorts from the government . Do you maybe see it too ? " Mr. Feldspan gave a louder grunt . " And I see how you went about getting this contract . I see a certain navy admiral  --  also a hotel room  --  also a redheaded young lady that you never had the pleasure of introducing to your wife . Is this picture clear to you ?

Such an inspiration , I say to myself , to know how much a man can change and improve and rise up above himself as he gets older . And would n't it bring happiness to the hearts of the New York City Pajama and Undergarment Association , I say to myself , if someone was to call this beautiful example to their attention ? Not to mention , of course , the tears of gratitude that would come pouring out from the incometax department . That 's what I say to myself , Manny .

" You 're a first-class , A Number One Al Capone , in person . I 've been saying it for years , and I 'll say it again . " Uncle Myron lowered his eyes modestly . " Thank you , Manny . I 'm flattered by the high opinion of an expert . " " Now it 's after eight o'clock , " said Mr. Feldspan , looking at his watch . " I 'm leaving . My chauffeur has probably got a parking ticket already , I 'll probably miss my train . I 'm going to Philadelphia to straighten out the mess that my moron salesman made .

Turning yourselves inside out and upside down to protect that good-for-nothing Leo , that loafer and swindler . Do n't you know it by now , how much good it 'll be ? One of these days he 'll go too far  --  one of these days he 'll get himself into such a trouble , not even his racketeer uncles can get him out of it . I 'm warning you , this is what 's going to happen . I 'm warningyou , people that are n't honest always have to pay for it in the end ! So once and for all , good night ! " And then he was gone for good . A few seconds later , as soon as they heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and burst out in her loudest , angriest voice , " Did you hear him ? NormanKramer , did you hear him ? Well , I hope you're44 THE **25;7388;TOOLONG ! So the whole bunch of us are crazy , are we ? Very nice ! So the Kramer family is out of its head , is it ? Lovely ! So everybody says so , do they ? Delightful ! You should be proud of yourself . What a wonderful reputationyou 're giving us with your softheartedness ! " Aunt Ruth 's words did n't sting him as they usually did . He was too full of his happiness and his relief . He even managed to put up a kind of defense : " It is n't softheartedness , Aunt Ruth  --  " " You 're right . It is n't . Softheadedness , that 's what it is ! Well , I wo n't stand for it ! Not one more incident of this sort will I stand for . I hope I still have a little family pride left , though all else may be gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a fool of himself in front of outsiders  --  and for what ? For a good-for-nothing ! I despise the vocabulary of that ignorant Feldspan person , but the fact is , good-fornothingis the word , and good-for-nothing I call him ! A lazy good-for-nothing who humiliates his family and lets his own brother work himself into a physical wreck so he can play cards and buy fancy neckties and go to night clubs with those vulgar blondes . Excuse me , but it 's got to stop  --  and I fully intend to stop it ! " There was something alarming about the way Aunt Ruth said these last words . Aunt Ruth expressing her opinion was one thing  --  it could n't lead to anything worse than a blush or a headache . But Aunt Ruth acTHEGOOD-FOR-NOTHING 45tually going into action and doing something  --  Heaven knows what terrible consequences that could have ! " It will stop , Aunt Ruth . I 'll talk to Leo about it tomorrow morning . I was planning to talk to him tonight , only there was no chance to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll give him a good strong talking-to . " " A good strong talking-to  --  you ? " And Aunt Ruth gave a snort that made Norman wince . " Excuse me , that 's a joke . Excuse me , I 'm laughing . I know all about your good strong talking-to 's . All he has to do is turn on that famous charm of his , and tell you what a worm he is and how sorry he feels and how much he loves and respects you  --  and in two minutes flat you 'll be falling all over yourself to apologize to him ! No , thank you , never mind your talking-to 's . I 'll do a little talking myself . " " Please , Aunt Ruth , " Norman said , his alarm growing , " I really wish you would n't get into another fight with him . I promise you I 'll be firm . " " Do n't worry . I 'm not going to get into any fights . Strategy , not violence , that 's my motto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head already . A foolproof plan to rescue you from that leech . " " What sort of a plan ? Aunt Ruth , please do n't try any plans ! " Aunt Ruth drew herself up to her full height and46 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGglared at Norman hard . " Do n't order me around , NormanKramer ! You 'll get rescued whether you like it or not ! " Uncle Myron cleared his throat and suggested that they turn on the television . " There 's a good murder show at eight-thirty , " he said . But it was too late  --  Norman 's cheerful mood was all gone , and not even the murder show could bring it back again . All he could think about was the talk he was going to have with Leo , and Aunt Ruth 's contemptuous snort . I will be firm , Norman told himself , as he climbed into bed that night ; I wo n't let him fool me with his famous charm . He was still awake at two o'clock , when he heard the front door open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , he did n't turn on his light , he did n't give any sign at all . Yes , he would be firm , there was no doubt about that  --  but he preferred to be firm in the morning. 4JUST AS NORMAN EXPECTED , LEO DID N'T wake up on time . Nolinan had to go through a long process of shouting in his ear , shaking him by the shoulder , and yanking at his covers . Finally Leo got up , THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 47yawning and groaning and rubbing his eyes  --  but not forgetting , even in his half-asleep state , to make a little joke about Norman and Simon Legree . Half an hour later , when he appeared in the kitchen , Leo was as wide-awake as he could be . He slapped Norman on the back . FIe sniffed around the room a few times and said , " What 's that funny smell ? Oh yes , I remember it now ! The morning air ! " He even offered to make pancakes . Norman firmly refused the offer . Leo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was up to . If they once got started on a siege of pancake making , the breakfast hour would fly past and it would soon be time for Norman to hurry down to the office . What with consultationsover the recipe book , a steady accompaniment of gay patter from Leo , and uproarious accidents with the flour and the salt , Norman would n't get a chance to say one word of what was on his mind . It was one of Leo 's oldest , most effective tricks . Make Normie laugh , get him involved in a game , and he 'll forget all about delivering that tiresome lecture . It was exactly what Leo used to do all the time when they were small boys . So Norman made Leo sit at the kitchen table now , until the eggs were fried and the coffee was boiled . Then he sat down opposite and put on his most serious expression . " Leo , there 's something on my mind  --  " But still Leo did n't give up his delaying tactics. 48 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spoil your dramatic effect , but I 'm afraid it would n't take any mind reader to guess that ! Frankly , you 've been looking awful lately . Positively mildewed . Why do n't you come out with it , Normie ? Unburden your soul . Make a full confession to your baby brother . " Norman glanced uneasily over his shoulder . " Yes , I will , Leo . If you 'll just lower your voice . I 'd rather that Mother did n't overhear . " " Sure , sure . So it 's that sort of a secret , is it ? Well , well , well . " Suddenly Leo straightened up and clapped a hand to his forehead . " My God , do n't tell me ! It is n't a  --  woman ? I congratulate you , I heartily congratulate you . Frankly , it 's about time you made a damn fool of yourself over some scheming female . " And beforeNorman could do anything about it , Leo was leaning across the table and pumping his hand up and down enthusiastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know how you feel , I really do . " Leo sat back in his chair and looked Norman up and down with a satisfied sort of smile that was really very disturbing . " In spite of my flippancy , I 'm full of sympathy for your predicament . You think it 's the end of the world , do n't you ? I went through it all myself a long time ago . Only it 's worse , of course , when a fellow waits till your age . It hits you harder when you'reTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 49older . And she 's probably some terrible floozy , is n't she ? That 's always the case with the shy retiring type . Like you  --  " " But I 'm not  --  " " Yes , you are . " Leo smiled and wagged a finger . " I know you better than you know yourself , and you definitely are . Innocent . Naive as the newborn babe . It 's touching , truly touching . " And he gave a sigh which was almost sentimental . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Leo leaned forward and looked very earnest . " No , no , Normie , you should n't let it upset you . Above all , you should n't brood about it . Let me take care of you . Put yourself in my hands . I 'll dig you up a sweet little number who 'll make you forget about that floozy in no time at all . My God , what else is a brother for ? " Norman knew that Leo was making fun of him  --  but once again it was the affectionate tone in which Leo did it that put him off balance , that kept him from being as firm as he should have been . It was always there between him and Leo , that terrible , tempting , insinuating net of affection . He had to fight against it every minute , against the pleasant easy course of relaxingand giving himself up to it and letting it coil around him protectively  --  " It 's very nice of you , " Norman said , lifting his chin , 50 THE GOOD - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . " But there is n't any woman . What 's bothering me  --  it 's you . You 're the only thing that 's bothering me . " " Me , Normie ? " Leo leaned back , and smiled idly up at the ceiling . " Am I really what 's bothering you ? Now I wonder  --  just an offhand guess  --  could it have anything to do with your mysterious disappearance yesterday afternoon ? " " Yes , it does . I went to the club yesterday afternoon . To have a talk with Uncle Myron . And last night I went to Uncle Myron 's apartment to have a talk with somebody else . With  --  with Mr. Feldspan , from the club . " " Feldspan ? " Leo 's eyes were clear and unflinching . " Manny Feldspan , you mean ? " " You know who I mean , Leo . You know which FeldspanI 'm referring to . He was there for quite a while  --  at Uncle Myron 's apartment . We had a long talk . " " You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaily as if this were the most casual conversation in the world . " No wonder you 're looking all squashed out . A long talk with Mammy Feldspan  --  my God , I 'm surprised you got home last night at all . Manny Feldspanis the type that spends a couple of hours telling you how he 's going to be brief and come straight to the point . And I suppose he gave you his usual campaignT H E G O O D- F O R- N O THIN G 51speech . I got my principles ! I got my honor ! I got my integrity ! ' " As usual Leo 's imitation was uncanny  --  Mr. Feldspan'sshrill little voice , Mr. Feldspan 's brisk little manner , even Mr. Feldspan 's belligerent chin . Norman was annoyed at himself for admiring it , so he made himself go on talking , more solemn and serious than ever . " Leo , listen to me . Mr. Feldspan may have his faults , but that does n't excuse  --  I mean , that 's no explanation  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened at the club Saturday night ! " Leo heaved a deep sigh . " Less than forty-eight hours ago , and it 's a household word already . Oh Mrs. Goldberg , did you hear what happened at the club Saturday night ? " Yes , I did , Mrs. Shapiro , I heard it just now from Mrs. Cohen . " Oh well , in that case I 'd better call up Mrs. Katz and tell her all about it . ' My God , Normie , does n't it get you mad sometimes ? What a friendly bunch of people we travel around with ! So concerned over our troubles . So interested in our private family affairs . Heart-warming , really heart-warming ! " For a second Norman just stared at him . He 's exasperated , Norman thought . Good Heavens , he 's exasperated ! Then Norman gave a shake of his head and said , " Please do n't make a joke out of it . Please  --  it 's no joke . Why did you do it , Leo ? " Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice really sympathetic and understanding . " That night  --  please tell me , Leo  --  what ever came over you ? " " Came over me ? Nothing came over me . " Leo laughed again  --  only this time it sounded a little strained . " All this fuss about the simplest , most natural thing in the world . " " Natural  --  ? " " Natural  --  that 's what I said , did n't I ? My God , in my position you would 've done exactly the same thing . " Leo got to his feet , and began to pace up and down as he talked . And every once in a while he stopped in front of Norman to make a point with a wave of his hand , a grin , or a wink . " Consider the situationobjectively . There you are , playing gin rummy with a fellow all night . And every time he wins a hand , and you throw down your cards and say , I 'm caught with ten points , ' does he even bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even once , even once in the whole evening , to turn your cards over , so he can see for himselfwhether he caught you with ten points ? No , he does n't . Not once , in hours and hours . Well , for God 's sake , Normie "  --  Leo waved his hand  --  " what 's the averagehuman being supposed to do in a situation like that ? That fellow you 're playing with is asking for everything he gets . He 's practically pleading with you to tell him a little white lie about how many pointsT H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N G 53you 're caught with . He 's practically handing you an engravedinvitation to tell him that you 're caught with ten points when maybe it 's really a little closer to thirty . After all , he 's playing a game with you , " Leo grinned , " and it 's only good manners , is n't it , that he should play to win ? If he 's so cocky and contemptuous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you the one who 's to blame for being tempted ? If he does n't even bother to watch out for his interests , why the hell should you ? So what I 'm getting at , Normie  --  if he goes along like that for the whole night , for hours and hours , and then all of a sudden , out of a clear blue sky , he says to you , Wait a second ! I do n't believe you 're caught with only ten points ! Let 's take a look at your cards ! '  --  " Leo winked . " Well , my God , I ask you  --  " " Leo , " Norman said in a low voice , looking down at his plate , " stop it . " " I 'll be finished in two seconds , Normie . " Norman gave a quick little shake of his head . " I do n't think I want to hear the rest of it . " " As I was saying "  --  Leo began to pace again and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , after going along for hours and hours without a word , well , what I 'd like to know is  --  where does he get off being mad at me ? I 'm the one who ought to be mad at him . I 'm the one who 's the victim of a54 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGdirty trick . " His pacing had brought him back to his seat now , and he dropped into it and leaned back , smilingcheerfully . " And if it was n't for the fact that I 'm such a good-natured , easygoing guy , who ca n't really hold a grudge more than ten minutes  --  " " Stop it ! " Norman cried , in a sharp hoarse voice . " Stop it right now ! " " Normie ! Such emotionalism . " Leo sat up straight and gave Norman a curious look . " From you of all people . All right , all right , I 'm stopping it . I 'll tell you what  --  why do n't we drop the whole subject ? Anything to keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to burst a blood vessel , " Norman said , in a lower voice , a little amazed at himself . " I 'm sorry  --  raising my voice like that  --  I hardly ever raise my voice . But Leo , the way you talk sometimes . I get all mixed up , I forget myself . Do n't you really understand it , Leo  --  do n't you really understand what you 've done ? You cheated at cards . I do n't know about temptations and invitations and all that . You cheated , that 's all I know about . It 's like  --  " The word stuck in his throat for a moment , and then he brought it out quickly . "  --  like stealing . It 's a terrible thing to do . " " Oh come now , Normie . " Leo smiled fondly across the table at him . " Watch out for those high-school dramatics . Stealing ! Why , Manny Feldspan 's got piles of money . THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 55 " But that does n't have anything to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Feldspan is n't even worried about the money . He told me so himself . " " No , he is n't worried about the money . He would n't kill his grandmother for it . Only wound her a little . " " Do n't joke about it  --  please , I asked you not to joke about it . " He waved away Leo 's joke , and went on more intently . " Do you know why we talked to Mr. Feldspan last night ? He wanted to bring charges against you to the House Committee . He wanted to get you expelled from the club . " " He did ? Well , well , well . " Leo 's tone remained casual , but Norman was sure that he could see a funny little glitter in his eye , just the tiniest trace of anxiety and uncertainty . " The world is full of small-minded people , is n't it ? Would you believe that a man could stoop so low , just because he lost a game of cards ? " " We asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Norman said , watching Leo very closely now . " Uncle Myron and Aunt Ruth did n't want to do it . They wanted to let you take the consequences . I had to beg them  --  " " And I 'll do the same for you some day , Normie . Uncle Myron and Aunt Ruth , with their old-fashioned prejudices  --  we of the younger generation have to put up a solid front against them . So you all tried to talk Manny Feldspan out of his revenge , did you ? Must56 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGhave been quite a hectic half hour . It would have amused me to listen in on it . " But it was unmistakable this time , that little trace of worry hidden beneath his smile . " So what happened ? I 'm curious . I 'm really curious . Did you succeed ? " " He was terribly angry , Leo  --  " " You did n't succeed . " Leo said this in his most offhand , unconcerned voice . " Naturally . Just as I thought . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere with a stubborn old windbag like Manny Feldspan . Well , well , well . " Leo laughed and rubbed his hands together . " So now I 'm no longer a member of the West Side Pinochle , Gin Rummy , and Whist Club , am I ? The kiddies do n't like my looks , so they wo n't let me play with them any more . All right , so I 'm heartbroken . So I 'll cry my eyes out in bed tonight . So I 'll spend the next week in a corner , sulking . " He got to his feet abruptly , turned his back to Norman , and became interested in fiddling with something on the stove . Norman watched him for a second or two , still frowning solemnly , but he was beginning to feel a little better . At least he cares , Norman thought . It matters to him , what people think of him . He 's sorry for what he did . " We did succeed , Leo , " Norman said quietly . " UncleMyron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charges . " For another second Leo just stood where he was , THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 57with his back to Norman . " Uncle Myron , " he said . " So that 's how it is . Well , well , well  --  " Suddenly he turned , a loud laugh came bursting out of him , and he clapped his hands together . " I knew it ! I knew it just as sure as I 'm standing here ! That Manny Feldspan  --  a cheap little hedger if there ever was one ! Lots of big talk and wild threats  --  but as soon as anybody calls his bluff , as soon as it 's a question of doing something , that little coward goes scooting off with his tail between his legs ! " Leo practically gave a hop as he came back to the table . " Oh , he knows who he 's dealing with all right ! That 's clear enough , is n't it , Normie old pal ? He knows he 'd better not try his tricks on us ! " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conspiratorial . For the first few moments of this speech Norman had just been staring at Leo weakly , numb with astonishment . But now the touch of Leo 's hand seemed to bring him to life . Hardly knowing what he was doing , he pulled his shoulder away and jumped to his feet . " Stop it , Leo , stop it ! Do n't you realize it yet  --  is it possible that you still do n't realize it ? " He took Leo 's arm in a tight grip and looked into Leo 's face hard , just as hard as he could , as if he hoped to stare him into understanding his words . " Mr. Feldspan was n't the one who did wrong ! The one who did wrong was you ! You cheated at cards  --  you cheated at cards "  --  58 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGhe actually found himself giving Leo 's arm a shake  --  " and you 've simply got to admit it ! " " Normie  --  " Leo said , looking puzzled  --  looking hurt almost ! But before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foyer  --  Mother 's voice , thin and high . " What 's going on out there ? Did somebody call me ? Is something the matter ? " Norman let go of Leo 's arm , and hurried to the other side of the kitchen , just a moment before Mother appeared in the doorway . She was dressed in a fluffy white nightgown , and looked terribly small and pale with cold cream on her face . " Is something the matter ? " she repeated . " Nothing , Mother , " Norman said , forcing himself to smile . " Everything 's all right . " " You are n't quarreling , are you ? What a lot of nonsense , for my two little boys to quarrel . " " Of course it is , " Norman said . " Why should we be quarreling ? Now why do n't you get back to bed , Mother  --  you need your sleep . " " Yes . Yes , I believe I will . I 've got a strenuous day ahead of me . So many letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as you 're not quarreling . " Mother blew them both a kiss , and disappeared . When he was sure that Mother was back in her room , Norman slipped his jacket off the back of hisT H E G O O D- F O R- N O T H I N G 59chair and started out to the foyer . He could hear Leo 's voice behind him  --  " Normie ! "  --  but he ignored him and went to the hall closet . He had his coat halfwayon , when he felt Leo 's hand on his arm . " Normie , will you wait a second  --  " " Please , Leo . Please do n't go on with it . I 'm not feelingwell . I 'll be late for the office . " " Normie , will you listen to me . You 're right . You 're absolutely right . I cheated at cards . " It took a moment for Leo 's words to register . Then slowly , Norman turned around to face him . " I do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've made me see it . I cheated at cards , and it was a terrible thing to do . I 'm ashamed of myself . I apologize . I 'm as sorry as I can be . " Norman studied him carefully . There was no sign of a smile on Leo 's lips , no gleam of sarcasm in his eyes . And his voice , too  --  it sounded sincere , it really sounded sincere . " Do you mean it , Leo ? Do you honestly  --  " " Do I honestly mean it ? " Leo smiled now , tight and bitter . " Yes , I can understand how you feel . It 's only natural you should doubt my honesty . What right do I have to expect you to trust me ? That 's the worst of it , that 's what 's really awful about these crazy messes I get into . Not Manny Feldspan  --  I 'm sorry about6o THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGManny Feldspan , but he 's not the important one . It 's you , Normie . It 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow ever had ! You spend half your life worrying about me , helping me out , sticking up for me to other people  --  I know it , I know it ! " Leo nodded his head vigorously . " I may act as if I do n't , but I do know it . And how do I pay you back ? How do I show my appreciation ? I kick you in the backside . I bite the hand that feeds me . I behave like a goddamn juvenile delinquent ! " Leo lowered his eyes , and he  --  yes , there was no doubt about it !  --  he blushed , he actually blushed ! But still Norman was cautious . " It does n't matter about me , " he said , watching Leo 's face . " All I care about is for you to stop doing these things . " " I will stop them ! " Leo raised his eyes and clenched his fists . " I will ! I give you my promise , my solemnpromise ! Only  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  You wo n't believe me . And why should you ? Who can blame you ? Have I ever shown you in the past that my word is worth anything ? No , I have n't . I 've been a heel , the lowest sort of heel . I 've been a liar , a cheat , a playboy  --  " It brought a little lump to Norman 's throat , to hear Leo say these things about himself . When he spoke , he was n't quite as cautious as before . " Who cares about the past ? It 's the future that counts ! " T H E G O O D- F O R- N O T H I N G 61 " No , no  --  " Leo shook his head  --  " you 're only saying that . You 're only trying to be nice to me . Was there ever such a nice guy as you ? Only you do n't have to pretend any more . You do n't have to spare my feelings . I know what I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is hopeless , do n't deny it . I 'm absolutely no good . " Norman 's caution was all gone by now , and he spoke up in his firmest , most persuasive voice . " Leo , you are good ! You 've got a great deal to you ! You 've got charm , and intelligence , and a sense of humor , and  --  and essentially you 've got much more ability than practically anyone your age that I know of . Much more ability ! I 've always said that  --  and after all , I know you better than anyone else in the world . " With a hesitant , sheepish sort of smile on his face , Leo looked up at Norman . " Do you think so ? Do you really think so ? " " Of course I think so . Would I lie about it ? I 've always been truthful with you , have n't I ? " " Yes . Yes , you have , have n't you ? Then you accept my apologies , Normie ? You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a better man ? " " Of course I believe it . " Norman concentrated all his strength , all his will power , on making Leo accept his words . " I 've never doubted it for a minute ! " What a relief it was , a moment later , when the old62 T H E GOOD - F O R - N O T H I N Ggood-humored smile spread over Leo 's face . " Thanks ! Thanks more than I can say ! " He took Norman by the hand . " That 's all I have in the world , you know . Your faith and confidence in me . And from now on , I 'll see to it that they 're not misplaced . I 'll get a job . I 'll get a wonderful job . I 'll work like a dog . I 'll make a million in no time ! And after that , I 'll take care of you , Normie , I 'll fix it so you 're all set for life , I 'll make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not necessary , Leo . Believe me , it is n't neces-sary . " " It is necessary ! And I 'll do it ! As long as you believe in me , I know that I can do anything ! " Then he took Norman by the arm and led him back to the kitchen , where they both had another cup of coffee and drank a toast to the future . And Norman was so happy that he could n't say a word , he just sat back and laughed at Leo 's extravagant chatter . His happiness lasted him for the rest of the day . Even while he was hard at work over the MacDougall Sportswear Company 's books ( Mr. Kleinman , the president , was a member of the club ) , he could still feel his happiness sort of glowing inside of him . Only once , for one little moment , did he have a doubt , a sudden memory of something Aunt Ruth had said to him last night  --  " All he has to do is turn on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . . . howTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 63sorry he feels .... " Impatiently he shook this thought out of his head . What did Aunt Ruth know about it , anyway ? She always did have a tendency to be oversuspicious . She could n't believe that anybody had any good points except herself . Good Heavens , Norman thought , his confidence quickly returning to him , what kind of a world would this be if a man could n't even trust his own brother ? 5NORMAN 'S AUNT RUTH HAD BEEN CALLED Agreat many things by her family , but one thing they never said about her , and that was that she did n't have a mind of her own . Everybody admitted that when Ruth decided she wanted something , she would command , insult , threaten , nag , stick her chin in the air like the Queen of England or yell her lungs out like a Bronx housewife , until she finally got it . This was especiallytrue if she happened to have come right out ahead of time and announced to the world what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the world sneer at her , or look down its nose at her , or take any liberties with her whatsoever . She had announced to Norman , in the presence of a witness , that she had a plan to rescue him from his brother . And so , all during the next few days , while Norman was congratulating himself on how firm he had been with Leo , Ruth was busy putting her plan into operation . Her movements were a big mystery . She wrote let-68 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGters , she made phone calls , she took a ride in the Cadillac down to Greenwich Village , she was seen by her unmarried sister-in-law , Hannah Kramer , with a huge volume entitled The Aesthetics of Modern Painting . And when Hannah ventured to ask her what she was doing with it , Ruth gave one of her most imperioussnorts and said , " Reading it ! What would you do with a book ? I 've always taken an interest in modern painting and other such cultural subjects  --  as you well know ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was no more equipped to throw up an out-and-out contradiction in Ruth 's face than she was to swim the English Channel or become a gun moll . Nor did the family have any better success in pumpingMyron . " You must know what she 's got in her head , " they said to him . " You 're her husband ! " But Myron just smiled politely , puffed his cigar , and said , " It never helped me yet . " On Friday night , Ruth was finally ready to come out with her secret . So she called the older members of the family together for a conference  --  all except Norman 's mother , that is  --  and explained her plan in detail . There were gasps and outcries . The men shook their heads and said it was impractical . The women , more attracted by the idea , told her with shiningeyes that she would n't dare . Myron sat back and THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 69made sarcastic remarks . But Ruth was firm . She turned her glare on them one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The very next morning she called up Leo at his apartment . He told her that he was all alone . Mother was downtown at a lecture on Music Appreciation , and Norman was at his office  --  " He spends his Saturdays lately with his nose in an account book  --  full of industry and initiative , my big brother . " This being the case , Ruth informed Leo that he could expect her , with Myron and Hannah , in half an hour exactly . In half an hour exactly , Leo opened the door to them . He was still in his bathrobe and pajamas , but he was just as much at ease as if he were wearing white tie and tails . He led them into the living room , offered them chairs , cigarettes , drinks  --  and when they refused his hospitality , he made himself comfortable in an easy chair , with his legs stretched out . For a long time Leo smiled at the family , and the family frowned back at him . At last , Leo broke the silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess it , I make a clean breast of it  --  you 've aroused my curiosity . I humble myself before you and ask you , what 's this all about ? Why all the secrecy ? Mysterious phone calls , furtive visits , suspicious questions about whether I 'm alone . Am I supposed to murder somebody ? I under-70 T H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N Gstand there 's a general impression that I would n't be above it . Or do you just want me to fix Aunt Hannah up with a nice young gigolo ? " Hannah blushed deeply , and Myron remarked to the air , " You know , you just ca n't convince some people that they 're not Milton Berle from the television . " One thing you can be sure of , Leo Kramer , " Ruth said . " We have n't come sneaking in like this , when everybody 's out of the way , because of your good looks or your witty conversation . Personally , the less I have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . We 're here because we 've got a very important matter to discuss with you . " Leo nodded his head and put on a serious expression . " Well , you understand , Auntie dear , it 's a little irregular , barging in like this without an appointment . Ordinarilyyou 'd have to go through channels  --  my private secretary would have to look you over . And even then the chances are I could n't see you for several months . Board of directors ' meetings , important clients , conferencesin Washington  --  a busy man like me  --  " " Busy ! " Ruth laughed . " You 're right ! Sleeping till noon every day , lounging in an easy chair all afternoon , throwing away your brother 's money at night  --  that certainly takes up a man 's time . Well , we wo n't keep you more than a few minutes , Mr. Rockefeller . The fact is , T H E G O O D - FOR - N O THIN G 71last night the family got together and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Me ! " " Exactly . What to do about you , that was the subject under discussion . " Leo gave a big , pleased smile . " The family actually had a special meeting just to discuss what to do about me ? They actually gave up a whole Friday night , that might have been profitably spent in running down their friends , complaining about taxes , and boasting about their mink coats  --  they gave up all this pleasure for me ? I 'm honored , positively honored . I tremble with emotion . Also , I 'm a little curious . Tell me , tell me , what did the family finally decide ? What are you going to do about me after all ? " His bantering tone did n't succeed in getting a smile out of Ruth . " There were a lot of suggestions , " she said . " You 'd probably tremble a little harder if you heard some of the more pointed ones . Unfortunately , the ones that most appealed to me had to be re-jected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? Usually the family thinks twice about rejecting what appeals to you , Auntie Ruth . " Leo turned his smile on Hannah . " Tell me , Auntie Hannah , were you the leader of the op-position ? " Hannah blushed harder than ever , and stammered72 T H E GOOD - F O R - N O T H I N Gout that she would n't think of disagreeing with what Ruth said  --  that is , whatever Ruth said , naturally she saw how right it was  --  that is  --  A look from Ruth put an end to Hannah 's stammering . Myron put in a word softly : " Because of Norman those suggestions were rejected . This I made sure of personally . " " Because of Norman  --  exactly . " Ruth nodded her head . " Because we all know that whatever our own personal inclinations might be  --  and I 've got some pretty strong ones , I can tell you that !  --  your brother Norman is going to keep us from carrying them out . The way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you were in college and you signed Myron 's name to that check . If it had n't been for Norman  --  " Leo sighed and shook his head  --  not impatiently , as if at his own discomfort , but sadly , as if at the wickednessof the world . " You 're still peeved about that check , are n't you ? Some people never forget a single incident out of the past . " " You should be grateful you got off with a peeve , Leo Kramer ! " A touch of anger disturbed Ruth 's haughty manner . " You do n't even appreciate it , do you  --  you are n't even conscious of it  --  how lucky you are that you 've got such a brother to hide behind ? " For a moment this brought a certain tightness to THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 73Leo 's smile . " With deference to your eagle eye , Auntie , I ca n't imagine what you could know , one way or another , about my appreciation of Normie . That 's a matter which is strictly between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Under his breath , Myron muttered , " This you can say again . " " Now if you do n't mind , " Leo went on , " I 've always hated suspense . What 's the deal ? What 's the story ? What 's the point of this visit ? " Ruth cleared her throat and gathered up her dignity . " Simply this . We 're all very fond of that brother of yours . He acts like a prize idiot most of the time , but we 're fond of him , we 've been fond of him ever since he was a little boy . And we think he deserves a little happiness in life . He 's been sacrificing himself to loafersand parasites long enough . He 's young , he makes a nice living , and it 's about time he was able to enjoy himself . " " Commendable , " Leo said . " Very commendable . I wholeheartedly agree with every word of it . I 'm always telling him to stop being such a stick-in-the-mud , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . I 'm afraid there 's no hope , though . He simply wo n't listen to my advice . He simply wo n't be coaxed out of that account book . I 'm afraid we have to make up our minds to it "  --  Leo spread his hands  --  " he likes this sort of74 T HE GO O D - F OR - NO T H I N Glife . He is n't interested in anything else . Enjoying himselfjust would n't strike him as very enjoyable . " " He 'll get used to it quick enough , Leo Kramer , as soon as one thing is settled . " Leo blinked his eyes . " One thing , Auntie dear ? " Ruth poked her chin forward , and whipped out her next speech savagely : " As soon as he gets you off his neck ! That 's what the family was discussing yesterday . We 're going to get you off his neck once and for all ! " And now it was Leo 's turn to be angry . His voice remainedcalm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Get me off his neck . Well , well , well . As usual , the family has its own quaint and colorful way of expressingthings . You may not be subtle , you may not be tactful or kind , I do n't think your fondest admirers could ever accuse you of showing much delicacy of feeling  --  but you do manage to make your point . Well then , " and the edge in Leo 's voice grew a little sharper , " I would n't want the family to suppose that I 'm not grateful for its warm interest and its unselfish advice , but do n't you think something might have been gained by consulting the party whose business this just happens to be ? " Suddenly , with a great air of exasperation , Leo slapped his hand down on the arm of his chair . " Who told you that I 've got any particular desire to get off his neck , ' as you so graciously put it ? As a matter off H E GO O D - F O R - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion comes at a very unfortunate moment . Things have n't been exactly flourishing for me the last few years . just the other day a certain deal I had high hopes for fell through . There seems to be less and less place in this cockeyed society for a man with any sort of originality or independence . The world is being taken over by dried-up old sourpusses who consider it a personal insult if you dare to laugh at your troubles , if you refuse to give them the satisfaction of seeing you moan and weep . " He accompanied this remark with a hard look at Ruth  --  which definitely made Ruth bristle . This reaction seemed to calm Leo down a little , and he went on in a more subdued , self-satisfied voice , " So to make a long story short , your anxiety to get me off Normie 's neck does n't answer one little question , which may seem trivial to you , but happens to be very important to me : What other necks are available ? Who 's making any better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling and nodding his head . " Now why is it I had a suspicion this is what you 'd get around to ? " " And why not ? " Leo turned to him , with another littleflare of anger . " Why should n't I get around to that ? just because you 're a great big millionaire , Uncle Myron , with the phenomenal luck to live in a period of history when people just happen to use a lot of underwear , do you think that gives you exclusive rights on76 THE GOOD - FOR - NOTHINGbreathing ? Every human being is entitled to make his way in this world  --  including loafers and parasites ! Normie would understand what I mean  --  he sympathizeswith my position  --  that 's exactly what makes him a hundred times superior to all the rest of you ! " Then Leo folded his arms over his chest , nodded firmly , and settled back in his seat . Ruth began to clap her hands . " Hurray , hurray . You just delivered the Gettysburg Address , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two seconds , you might be interested in my proposition . " " I never said I would n't listen . " Leo 's tone was pleasantand casual again . " I just wanted to be sure that you do n't misunderstand my motives . " " I wonder , Leo , " Ruth said , very clear and sharp , " if you 've ever considered looking for a wife . " " A wife ? " " Do you know the meaning of the word ? I was n't so sure , judging from those blond tramps I 've seen you with . " Hannah blushed , and Ruth said to her , " Excuseme , Hannah . But you wanted to come along this morning . You 've got to face the brutal realities of life some time before you die . " Then she turned back to Leo : " Well , we 'll drop that subject . I promised myself before I came up here today that I 'd insult you as little as possible . A wife is what I said . A sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . A homeTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 77where you can relax and be comfortable , where the chairs are soft and the food is good and the liquor closet is never empty . A home with a big bedroom all your own , twice as big and ten times as luxurious as the room you 're living in now  --  and incidentally , a closet full of expensively tailored suits . A home with a country club membership to go along with it , and a bank account that 'll make it possible for you to play gin rummy morning , noon , and night , and you 'll never have to cheat once . And most important of all  --  a home away from New York , over on the other side of the country , way out West , for instance , where the closest you can get to your brother Norman is over the long-distance telephone . Now tell me , Leo , would n't you like to marry a girl who can give you a home like that ? Would n't you consider that a better offer ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he motionedat Ruth . " Hold on , Auntie dear . Slowly , slowly . Are you trying to tell me that she really exists , this dream girl ? She 's not just a figment of the family 's wild imagination ? " " She not only exists , " Ruth said , " I 've arranged for you to meet her tomorrow night . " " But who is she ? What planet did she drop from ? " " She dropped from Omaha , Nebraska . Her name isBrenda Goldhill , and she 's the daughter of Ethel Gold-78 THE GOOD -F OR-NOTHINGhill , who happens to be an old friend of mine from Wellesley . She was Ethel Finkel from Newark , New Jersey , in those days , but shortly after graduation she married this Goldhill and moved out West with him . I 've been corresponding with her on and off over the years , so when her daughter decided to come to New York and take a job with a fashion magazine , naturally Ethel wrote me and asked me to be nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Normanand your mother are coming too . " " A job with a fashion magazine , you said ? " Ruth gave a grunt . " Do n't worry . Her father has plenty of money . He 's in the department store business  --  he used to have a pushcart in New York , then he went to Omaha and made a million dollars . The girl 's just finished Wellesley herself , and she 's full of ideas about having a career and making her own way in life  --  she paints or something  --  so her father used his contactsand got her this magazine job at half salary . From the way she keeps talking about her independenceand so on , I should say that she 's just about ready to settle down and get married . " " And you think I 'm the fellow who can grab her ? " Ruth shrugged . " You can try . You 've always been pretty good at grabbing things . And you do have a reputation for having a personality . Personally I ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOOD -F OR-NOTHING 79females who  --  well , anyway , after dinner tomorrow night , you and the girl will go off to the theater together . Myron has two tickets  --  he 'll say that somebody from his office gave them to him , that way it wo n't seem unnatural that the rest of us are n't going along . So you and the girl will have the whole evening to yourselves  --  and we 'll see if you have any talent at all to your credit ! " " In one evening , Auntie dear ? Now Casanova himself could n't  --  " " One evening or a hundred evenings ! You can have as long as you need . And you 'll get the full support of the family while you 're at it . We 'll invite you for dinner , we 'll give you tickets to the theater , we 'll lend you our cars , we 'll ooh over you and aah over you and praise you to the skies and tell the most disgraceful lies about you , and make out that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know what ? " Myron said . " I 'm even willing to get a couple of my old suits cut down for you . " " And if you ever want a simple home-cooked meal , " Hannah said , " Miss Teitelbaum and me  --  " Miss Teitelbaum was the lady who shared Hannah 's apartment in Washington Heights . " In short , anything at all , " Ruth broke in . " Just so you marry the girl in the end , and go away to Omaha for good . " 8o THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGLeo looked at Myron , looked at Hannah , looked for a long time at Ruth . And then he said , " So this is it ? This is the family 's proposition ? " " This is it , " Ruth said . " Take it or leave it . " They were all amazed , the next moment , to see Leo throw back his head and burst out laughing . For several minutes he rocked back and forth in his chair , roaring and spluttering and slapping his knee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth drew herselfup and cried out , " What 's the matter with him now ? For Heaven 's sake , what does he think is so amusing ? " Myron shrugged and said , " Such conceit ! Now he laughs at himself even when he did n't make a joke . " Leo 's laughter quieted down a little , and he managed to bring out some words . " I did n't , Uncle Myron  --  but you did ! This whole proposition  --  my God , it 's the funniest thing I ever heard  --  I ca n't stand it , I ca n't live through it ! " For several more minutes he was overcome , and then he brought out words again , " You and Aunt Ruth and the family  --  it 's hilarious  --  I 'll die laughing ! " " No such luck , I 'm afraid , " said Ruth , not bothering to lower her voice . " The whole bunch of you , " Leo went on . " The whole solid respectable virtuous bunch of you , coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm proud of you ! I would n't have believed you had it in you ! But tell meTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 81  --  please , I implore you , do n't keep me in suspense  --  what are you doing about your consciences ? " and Leo stopped laughing and smiled at them all in a way that made them fidget a little  --  even Ruth , though she accomplishedher fidgeting with a sniff and a snort . " You know what I mean , " Leo went on , " those big hardworkingconsciences of yours that are always so quick to pounce on any little thing that I might do ? How are you squaring them for this shady maneuver ? What about you , Uncle Myron ? You 're such a moral , upstandingmember of the community . You 're always reminding me what an honest man you 've been all your life . How come you 're not seething with indignation at all this ? " Myron occupied himself in lighting a cigar , and his voice was not quite steady . " Never did I say that a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest up to now , because I never saw the point yet in not being honest . It was never worth it to me yet , to be dishonest . All right , so now it 's worth it to me . For Norman I do it  --  for Norman I 'm happy to sacrifice my hon-esty . " " And the girl , this Brenda Goldhill ? Are you happy to sacrifice her too ? You are n't having any sleepless nights over her ? " Myron looked straight at Leo and made his voice as dignified as he could . " Never mind about my sleepless82 T H E GOO D- F O R- NOT H I N Gnights , " he said . " It 's my own private business , how I spend my nights . " Leo chuckled and rubbed his hands together . He knew that he was in control of the situation , and he made no effort to conceal his knowledge . " And what about you , Aunt Hannah ? What about your conscience ? You ca n't tell me that Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time  --  " " What is all this nonsense , anyway ? " Ruth cut in loudly , while Hannah was still hunting for words . " What 's it all got to do with being honest or dishonest in the first place ? I do n't for one moment admit that I 'm doing anything the least bit dishonest ! I venture to say that my conscience is just as clear as the next person 's . Is it dishonest to try and make a match between two eligible young people ? Is it dishonest to work out a good practical arrangement that will benefit all parties ? " " All parties , Auntie dear ? " Leo leaned back . " Now I 'd really like to hear how you figure out that one . " " It 's self-evident , " Ruth said . " Norman will be benefited , because he 'll be free from you at long last . You 'll be benefited , because you 'll be all set for life in the manner to which you 're dying to become accustomed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Leo , with a particularly insinuating littlesmile . " Because , " Ruth went on firmly , " she could do a lotTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 83worse than marry a nephew of mine . A healthy , goodlooking , well-educated young man from one of the finest , most respectable Jewish families in New York . All right , so you 've got your faults . Who does n't ? They 'll just give her a chance to use her womanly influence on you and make a new man out of you . It 'll do her good , and it 'll do you good , and five years from now you 'll all be thanking me for my foresight . And besides , " Ruth added , suddenly infuriated by Leo 's smile , " you 're a fine one , Leo Kramer , to be giving me a sermonabout honesty ! Let 's get down to facts . Do you or do n't you accept the proposition ? " The rest of their conversation concerned itself strictly with formalities and technicalities . Leo said how touched and gratified he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little doubt . What was wrong with the girl ? How come she had n't been snapped up already ? Was she so horrible-looking ? Did she have two heads or a hunchback ? Or was it her disposition ? Great wealth , he pointed out , is often accompanied by a correspondingly great talent for nagging the hell out of a man . Ruth assured him that there was nothing wrong with the girl at all . Her looks were charming  --  the fluffy , baby-faced type , but very pretty . And her dispositionwas fine . Just a wide-eyed little girl from a small town , willing to believe that practically anybody is a god . " Be nice to her , " Ruth said , " and she 'll proba-84 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGbly worship you . " But Leo was still suspicious , and so it was agreed that his final answer to the proposition should depend on his impression of the girl tomorrow night . As soon as he made up his mind about her , he promised to let the family know . Myron now brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were carrying out their little plan , not a word was to be mentioned about it to Norman . Leo grinned at this  --  a wise , knowing , highly unpleasant grin . " You 're afraid his conscience wo n't be as co-operative as your own , Uncle Myron ? " he said . But in the end , Leo agreed to Myron 's condition . Personally , he had a funny feeling that if there were ever a showdown , they could probablywin Normie over in the end  --  but why take the risk ? Not a word to Normie , that was understood . They disposed of a few more practical details , and then the family got up to go . " Now that we 're all partners , " Leo said , as he walked them to the door , " it seems to me we ought to shake hands on it . " He held out his hand to Ruth . " How about it , Auntie dear ? " She looked down at his hand for a moment as if it were some peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally she nodded her head . " All right . Why not ? But it 's strictly business , do n't forget that . Absolutely nothing friendly about it . " " Auntie dear , " said Leo , as he shook her hand , " ITHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 85respect your convictions , and I continue to love you in spite of them . " They were out the door , and the elevator was on its way up , when Leo suddenly said , " Oh by the way , there 's just one little point that I 'd like to raise . Purely a matter of curiosity , you understand . " " Go ahead , " Ruth said . " Raise it . " " Uncle Myron is a rich man , is n't he ? And he is n't the only rich one in the family , is he ? In fact , there 's a considerable amount of the wherewithal floating around among the lot of you , is n't there ? So I 'm wondering  --  if you 're all so fond of Normie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't do something about it a long time ago ? Why go to the trouble of digging up a Brenda Goldhill from Omaha ? What 's been stopping you from merely chipping in , paying me a nice comfortable annuity , and sending me off to Omaha on your own ? " In the pause that followed , the elevator arrived and the door slid open . " Do n't answer that if you 'd rather not , of course , " Leo said , with a smile . Ruth was the first to recover . She grabbed Myron by the arm and Hannah by the shoulder , and hustled them into the elevator . " Come on , come on ! " she said . " No more of this idle talk ! No more of these foolish questions ! Good Heavens , I have n't got all day ! " 86 T H E G O O D- F O R - N O T H I N GLeo made a sweeping bow . " Good-by , Auntie dear . No sooner do I have you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never to catch more than a fleeting glimpse of your beauty ? " " Do n't try your charm on me , Leo Kramer ! " Ruth cried . " I 'm not interested in your charm ! I do n't charm that easy ! " Then she gave the button a ferocious stab , and the elevator door slid shut. 6SUNDAY AFTERNOON NORMAN PLAYED CARDSat the club for the first time in many months . The reason for this display of high spirits was somethingLeo said to him that morning at breakfast . All week , ever since they had had their talk together , Normanhad been waiting , a little more anxiously each day , for Leo to give some sign that he had n't forgotten his promise , that he was really planning to turn over that new leaf he had spoken about . This morning the sign finally came . " Do n't build up your hopes now , " Leo said , " but I think I 'm onto something . I 've been doing a lot of nosing around , and I think I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big . Of course , it 'll mean a lot of hard work , it 'll mean applying myself nightT H E G O O D - F O R- N O THIN G 87and day  --  but not another word , " he said with a wink , when Norman asked him for details . " It 's all very hushhush , I 've been sworn to secrecy . Suffice to say , if things work out as I have an inkling they will , I 'll be all set for life , Normie  --  and you 'll be all set along with me ! " Norman trembled with excitement at Leo 's words . All set for life  --  there was something almost magical about this phrase . It called up in a rush all the fondest images , the most delicious daydreams , which Norman had strictly forbidden himself for years and years . It called up money in the bank and a couple of new suits , meals in restaurants and rides in taxicabs , Sunday afternoonsat the club and peaceful pleasant evenings , relaxingin the easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisecracks and snickers and embarrassing questions . It called up that Levinson girl from ten years ago , watching him so intently , nodding her head as he spoke  --  There were other girls like that in New York , he was sure of it , quiet , serious-minded girls who could sympathize with his ideas . Aunt Ruth was always trying to introduce him to them  --  " When will you be sure about it , Leo ? " he said . " I mean  --  when will you have some definite news ? " " Hard to say , Normie . Who knows , something might come through this very day . In fact , there 's good reason to hope that I 'll have something encouraging to88 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGreport before the end of Aunt Ruth 's dinner tonight . " Tonight ! It was too much for Norman . How could he add up figures at the office or mope around the apartment with such a thing on his mind ? If there was really so little time left before the big change began , before his new future opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm in treating himself to a little previewof it right now , in throwing off duties and drudgeriesfor just this one afternoon and enjoying a game of gin with the boys ? The boys welcomed him enthusiastically . They raised a great shout when they first caught sight of him  --  " My God ! It 's Norm Kramer ! Back from the dead ! " They made jokes about " What 's been keeping you away , Kramer ? Scared of losing your shirt ? " They pounded him on the back until he was really quite sore . Judge Pearlman , the oldest member of the club , whose left profile made him look like Supreme Court Justice Cardozo , shook Norman 's hand and said in that slow dignified voice of his , " The prodigal son returns to the fold . Welcome home , my boy . " And of course , nobody said a word to him about last week 's unpleasantness with Leo . It was all so good-natured and friendly , and everybodyseemed so pleased to see him  --  genuinely pleased , not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttering , and he was really on the verge ofTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 89making a fool of himself . But the steward came in just then with highballs , and he was able to hide his feelingsbehind his glass . Then he settled down to the game with Judge Pearlmanand Dr. Irving Glazer , the heart specialist , and Sigmund Wolff , the fur man  --  and he played until almostsix o'clock . He knew he had a dinner appointment , he knew what Aunt Ruth would say if he were late , but he just could n't tear himself away from the game , and afterwards from that final farewell highball and that final round of dirty jokes . All in all , it was nearly seven o'clock before he arrived at Park Avenue and moved across the gleaming , red-carpeted lobby with a lighter , jauntier step than he had used in a long long time . The living room was crowded . Everybody had arrived but Mother . Uncle Myron was on his sofa ; Leo was near the drinks ; Aunt Ruth was in her regular easy chair ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting ; and sitting on the most uncomfortable , straight-backed chair in the room was his widowed Aunt Fanny , who always looked as if she were about to burst into tears . Also there was a stranger in the room  --  a small dark girl with very bright eyes and a face that was almost , but not quite , plump . Norman just had time to nod his head and say hello to the family when Leo came up to him and put a hand90 T H E G O O D - F O R- N O THIN Gon his shoulder . " Hello , hello . I 'd like you to meet someone . " And Leo led him across the room to the small dark girl . " This is Brenda Goldhill , from Omaha , " he said . " She 's a friend of Aunt Ruth 's . And I hope , from now on , she 's going to be a good friend of ours . " It struck Norman as a little odd that Leo should be taking it on himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Ruth 's . But he really did n't think twice about this . He shook hands with her and told her how glad he was to meet her . " And I 've been looking forward to meeting you , Mr. Kramer , " she said , in an eager , breathless sort of voice . " Your brother has been telling me the nicest things about you . " Leo laughed and nudged him in the ribs . " Nothing but the truth , Norman , I give you my word . " " Norman  --  ? " Now here was something else that was odd  --  and for a second Norman turned a puzzled look on Leo . But he was n't able to be puzzled for long , becausethis Brenda Goldhill girl was talking to him again . " You must be so proud of your brother , Mr. Kramer . It is n't everybody who has so many varied abilities . A talented writer  --  " " Abilities ? Talent ? " " We were just talking about it a moment before youTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 91arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About the writing he used to do when he was in college . Your aunt and uncle were telling me  --  " " My aunt and uncle  --  ? " " You remember , Norman , " Aunt Ruth said , with a smile that was astonishingly friendly and gracious . " What a prolific writer Leo used to be in college . " " Absolutely , " Uncle Myron said . " There was one little thing of his in particular  --  a little piece of fictionin which I personally was a leading character . Could I ever forget it ? It was n't so long , but it certainlymade an impression . " Norman was completely confused by now . Everybodywas acting so strangely tonight . He could hardly follow the conversation . Or maybe it was all those highballs he had had at the club ? " How about a drink before dinner , Norman ? " Leo said . Norman shook his head and made his way quickly to a seat . For the next few minutes , the conversation moved along more comprehensible lines . Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where 's your mother , Norman ? " she said . " After all these years  --  if you 'll excuse my saying so  --  that sister-in-law of mine has no more sense of time than a little baby ! " Aunt Hannah rose to Mother 's defense with a few quick mumbles about the dreadful New York traffic and the92 T H E G O O D - F O R- N O T H I N Gdifficulty in finding taxicabs at this time of night  --  but it was a feeble defense , quickly squelched by a snort from Aunt Ruth . Aunt Fanny shook her head back and forth , and said in that whiny , mournful voice of hers , " Maybe she got into an accident . Maybe her cab overturned , and she 's in the hospital  --  " Listening to all this familiar talk , Norman soon recovered his presence of mind . He forgot about everybody'speculiar behavior of a few minutes ago , and began to think about important matters . Leo had told him that there might be some encouraging news tonightabout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo 's face for any sign of it . Leo certainly looked happy enough . He was sitting on the arm of this Brenda Goldhill 's chair , bending down a little , smiling at her and nodding his head as she talked . There must be good news , Norman thought . Leo must be in a good mood over something  --  because Norman had never before known him to sit quiet for such a long stretch of time and listen to somebody else talk . " Oh Mrs. Kramer , " Brenda Goldhill suddenly called out to Aunt Ruth , " I ca n't tell you how grateful I am that you invited me tonight . There 's really nothing as lonely , is there , as a Sunday night in a strange city ? One of the girls who works an the magazine with me  --  Natalie Du Bois , she 's from Savannah , Georgia  --  she'sT H E G O O D- F O R- N O T H I N G 93writing a piece on that theme . She writes the most interestinglittle pieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry  --  " Aunt Fanny began to nod her head . " I know what you mean , about being alone . Twenty years I 've been alone , all alone in my apartment , ever since my poor husband passed away . It 's no life for a human being , I can tell you that . They say that more widows die of heart attacks than any other  --  " " Oh stop that nonsense , Fanny ! " Aunt Ruth said . " There 's nothing wrong with your heart ! The last time Dr. Glazer looked you over , he said you were healthier than he was ! " " Doctors , " Aunt Fanny said . " There 's plenty people that dropped dead in the hands of a doctor . What about our own second cousin , poor Goldie Blatt ? Do n't worry , do n't worry , ' the doctors told her , and all the time she was slowly filling up with pus  --  " " And you know what 's the most wonderful thing about New York ! " Brenda Goldhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer or an artist or in the publishing business or something intellectual like that . It 's such a change from Omaha . It 's so stimulating and exhilarating and  --  stimulating . I feel as if I 've been spending my whole life in a prison , and I 've got my freedom at last . " " Now Omaha is n't really so bad , is it ? " Aunt Ruth94 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGsaid . " From what I 've heard , Omaha would be a very pleasant luxurious place for a young person to settle down in . " Aunt Ruth 's tone was peculiar  --  sort of intense and significant  --  and yet Norman just could n't see what the significance could possibly be . Well , he supposed it was those highballs again . And besides , he was much more interested in figuring out how to detach Leo from the company for a few minutes , how to take him aside and ask him about his good news . " And of course , New York is just ideal for a person with artistic leanings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got so many cultural facilities  --  concerts , and art museums , and bookstores , and so many other cultural facilities . But I guess you think I 'm being terribly provincial and naive about it all . Being a writer and all "  --  she turned to Leo  --  " you must take those culturalfacilities for granted . " Leo smiled  --  a funny smile for him . A sad , sweet , patient sort of smile . " I ca n't go under false pretenses any longer , Miss Goldhill . I 'm not really much of a writer nowadays , I 'm afraid . I was forced to give it up a long time ago . " Norman started to feel confused again . " Give it up  --  ? " He could n't even recall when Leo took it up ! " You were forced to give it up ? " the Goldhill girl said . THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 95 " For business , " Leo said . " I 'm in business now . I 'm  --  well , you might say I 'm in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Business  --  finance  --  and after you used to be a writer ! " A look of great concern came over the girl 's face . " But how can you bring yourself to do it ? You know what Natalie Du Bois says  --  that 's the girl from Savannah , Georgia , I was telling you about , the one who writes . She says that her art is more important to her than life itself . " Again that sad sweet smile from Leo . " And I envy her , " he said . " It 's the fortunate individual who can afford to devote himself to something more important than life itself . As for the rest of us  --  well , what can a man do ? A man has to earn his living in this world . Especially if a man is n't all alone . Especially if a man has responsibilities , as I do . As Norman and I do , " he added , with a smile at Norman . " You see , there 's our mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your mother , " said Uncle Myron , leaning back and shutting his eyes . " M-o-t-h-e-r . What else ? " " Mother , mother , " Aunt Ruth said , in an urgent whisper . " You heard him , Norman . " " But it 's terrible ! " the Goldhill girl said , and she really seemed sincerely upset . " It just seems terrible  --  that a person with your talent should have to sacrifice96 THE **26;7415;TOOLONG like that ! How do you bear it ? Are n't you miserable ? " " Miserable ? " Leo shook his head slowly . " No . No , I would n't call it miserable . I have my bad moments , Isuppose  --  but a man has no right to inflict his troubles on others . " What troubles ? Norman thought . He searched his mind desperately for some explanation for Leo 's crazy talk . Maybe the news about his proposition was n't good , he thought . Maybe that 's why he 's acting this way , because he 's all disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply had to talk to Leo alone . He was even on the point of standing up and asking Leo straight off to go into another room with him  --  but he was stopped by the doorbell . " There she is ! " Aunt Ruth said . " There 's your mother  --  and about time , I must say ! " " Miss Goldhill , " Leo said , in a low voice , " I 'd really appreciate it if you did n't say anything to my mother about all this  --  what we 've just been talking about , that is . We try and keep things happy and cheerful for her . She 's had enough sadness in her life as it is . " In the confusion of Mother 's entrance , Norman tried to catch Leo 's eyes . But somehow he could n't do it . Somehow , no matter how hard he stared at Leo , Leowas always looking away from him , always occupied with Brenda Goldhill . THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 97And then , when Mother was through kissing her family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for news of Miss Teitelbaum , inquiring after Aunt Fanny 's heart , she went bustling up to Leo , and he introduced her to Brenda Goldhill . " A friend of mine from Omaha , Nebraska , " that was what he called her this time . " I 'm so happy to meet you , Miss Goldhill , " Mother said . " From Omaha , Nevada ? Well , you 're quite a distancefrom home , are n't you ? I used to correspond with a charming woman in Nevada . She was a Christian Scientist , and I was toying with the idea that year  --  " " I 'm happy to meet you , Mrs. Kramer . Your son and I were just having the most stimulating conversation on cultural things . " " Cultural things ? " Mother beamed on Leo . " Why , Leo dear , I 'm delighted that you 're finally beginning to take an interest in cultural things  --  " "  --  the way you used to do in college , Leo dear ! " Aunt Ruth shouted out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were you talking about ? " Mother said . " You would have enjoyed this lectureI just attended . It 's part of a series on music ap-preciation . " " I attended a lecture myself last night , " said Brenda Goldhill . " Natalie Du Bois  --  she 's a very interesting girl from Savannah , Georgia  --  took me to it . It was98 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGall about modern poetry . They had this modern poet there , and he gave a reading from his own poems  --  " And Mother and Brenda Goldhill became involved in a terribly complicated discussion about their respectivelectures . Mother would pour out information about her lecture until she ran out of breath , and then Brenda would pour out information about her lecture , and as soon as she was out of breath Mother would take over again . For a long time they were at it hot and heavy , and Leo stood on the sidelines watching . Now 's my opportunity , Norman told himself . Now I 'll find out about my future once and for all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They told us all about Papa Haydn , " Mother said , " and there was a woman who played the piano . Really an excellent pianist . You would n't believe that such a tiny woman could have such powerful hands . " " It was terribly exciting , " Brenda said , " the way he read his poems . So much feeling and expression and so on . His voice got sort of low and mumbly sometimes , so that you could n't exactly catch every single one of the words  --  and then all of a sudden it got terribly loud  --  but that was all part of the expression . Natalie Du Bois says that he 's considered to be a really greatreader . " " He did have such a sad life , that poor Papa Haydn , " THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 99Mother said . " You know , his wife died when he was only a young man . Or was it his mother  --  ? " Norman was all the way across the room now . One step more would bring him right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , as he thought how close he was to knowing , definitely knowing  --  " You could go from one end of the year to the other without hearing such a lecture in Omaha , " Brenda said . " What do they care about art and culture and the finer things of life in Omaha ? Everybody is so mercenaryand materialistic . Money , money , money , that 's all they think about . Well , that 's all right , I guess , for the older generation who were brought up that way and do n't know any better  --  but I feel that a young person my age has to rise above all that , we have to free ourselvesfrom material considerations . Do n't you agree with me , Mr. Kramer ? " And she turned eagerly to Leo . Leo nodded his head . " Absolutely , Miss Goldhill . That 's always been my chief object in life , to free myselffrom material considerations . " Norman was about to tap Leo on the shoulder  --  but he stopped himself . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the whole turn that the conversation had suddenly taken  --  " That 's why I came to New York , you see , " the Goldhill girl was saying . " Because the atmosphere at100 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGhome was so stultifying . Always the same old surroundings  --  that huge house in that hideous old-fashioned style , that ugly antique furniture , that swimming pool which is really a dreadful eyesore , even if it is the biggestone in the neighborhood . " Norman lowered his hand and took a step away from Leo . He was listening hard now to every word the girl was saying . " And always the same old monotonous routine  --  drinking cocktails , playing tennis , off to roadhouses till four in the morning . And always the same old commonplacepeople  --  Daddy 's friends bragging about how much money they 're making , Mother 's friends showing off their expensive clothes from San Francisco , even the young people  --  believe it or not , Mr. Kramer , even the boys and girls my own age  --  talking about nothing except their Cadillacs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be like ! " " Vividly , " Leo said . Norman looked at him , and then looked away quickly . His desire to take Leo aside , to question him about that proposition , was all gone now . Somehow there were too many other things in his head , too many vague half-formed thoughts and odd little feelings that had n't been there two minutes ago . What he wanted most of all  --  and he knew that it was impossibleT H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N G 101  --  was to get off by himself somewhere and think things out . " But here in New York , " the Goldhill girl was going on , breathlessly and happily , full of pleasure in her words and in everybody 's attention , " for the first time in my life I feel that I can truly be myself . I have my little apartment in Greenwich Village . I have no servantsat all , just the girl who comes in to clean up . I do all my eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fascinating , I 've already made all sorts of fascinating friends  --  " Norman forced himself to speak up . " Your father is in business , Miss Goldhill ? In Omaha , I mean  --  ? " " Yes , he 's in the department store business . He 's got the second biggest department store in town . And of course , he has an interest in this hotel chain , and  --  well , I do n't really know much about it , Mr. Kramer . I 've never really had a head for such things  --  " " The second biggest department store , " Norman said . " Dinner ! " Uncle Myron said , getting to his feet . " Personally I 'm starving  --  let 's have some dinner ! " " Yes , yes , come on everybody , " said Aunt Ruth , clappingher hands together . " Enough talk , down to business . Into the dining room , into the dining room ! " " Let 's sit next to each other , Miss Goldhill , " Leo102 T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T H I N Gsaid , taking the girl 's arm . " There are so few girls nowadaysthat a man can really talk to . " The girl laughed , and Norman could n't miss noticinghow bright her eyes were as she looked up at Leo . " And you 're one of the few men , Mr. Kramer  --  " They walked past Norman and out of the room . The family crowded into the dining room , Norman straggling along behind the rest . It was a big meal , full of the sort of expensive dishes  --  squabs and artichokes and caviar and so on  --  that Aunt Ruth liked to serve to her relatives . The conversation  --  in fact , a great many conversations  --  kept going every minute , and everybody was having a wonderful time  --  except Aunt Fanny , of course , who could n't ask for an extra potato without adding , " But do n't bother if there are n't enough left  --  do n't trouble yourself over me  --  I 'm quite accustomed to  --  " But Norman had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save himself from Mother 's questions about his health and from Aunt Ruth 's defenseof her cook . And he avoided Leo 's eye all through the meal . After dinner it seemed that arrangements had been made for Leo to go off to the theater with Brenda Goldhill . Their leave-taking , like all leave-takings in the family , was a long , involved ritual . Conversations had to be finished , hands had to be shaken , wishes for a pleasant evening had to be expressed several timesTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 103over . Aunt Hannah , in her enthusiasm for the enjoyabletime they were going to have , had to tell the young couple the whole plot of the play they were about to see . And Aunt Fanny had to shake her head and mutter about how she used to like the theater when her poor husband was alive , but of course she never went any more , what was the point when you were all alone in the world ? Suddenly Norman found himself shaking hands with Leo , and there was a big grin on Leo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of voice . " Rememberwhat I mentioned to you this morning , Normie ? About that proposition I 'm working on ? Well , it looks good , Normie . It definitely looks good . Any day now we can expect some positive results ! " Somebody pulled Leo away , and more good-bys were said , and finally Leo and Brenda went out to the hall and the front door was shut behind them . But Norman could still hear their voices : " Will you tell me more about your writing , Mr. Kramer ? I know that some authorsdo n't like to talk about it  --  " " Not me , Miss Goldhill . One thing I 've never had any objection to , and that 's talking . Only what 's this Miss Goldhill  --  Mr. Kramer business ? My name happens to be Leo . " " Well then  --  mine is Brenda ! " The family returned to the living room , and in a momenteverybody was talking about the same thing  --  104 T H E GOOD - F O R - N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely girl she was , so sweet , so pretty , so intelligent and refined . " And such lovely clothes she was wearing ! " Mother cried . " That dress must have cost her a tremendous amount of money ! " Norman sat quietly in his corner . So this is it , he thought . This is Leo 's proposition , his new leaf , the hard work that he 'll have to apply himself to night and day . And this is my wonderful new future , Norman thought . This is the freedom I was looking forward to , the money in the bank and the peaceful pleasant evenings and that quiet serious-minded girl  --  this is what they all amount to . For a second Norman was angry . He gave me his promise ! His solemn sacred promise ! He told me that this sort of thing would never happen again . He 's a good-for-nothing , that 's all there is to it ! A liar , a cheat , and a good-for-nothing ! Well , I wo n't let him get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away  --  I 'll give him a talking-to tonight  --  Norman 's anger melted into uneasiness . A talking-to . Only what kind of a talking-to ? What would he talk about anyway ? " You ought to be ashamed of yourself  --  you have to stop doing these things  --  you should go out and earn an honest living  --  " The same old words , the same old cliches ; Norman had repeated them so many times that he felt like a fool every time he repeatedT H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N G 105them again . He felt as if he were the one who was gettingthe talking-to . He hated it  --  going through another one of those scenes with Leo  --  he simply hated the thought of it ! And then  --  he tried to make himself smile and shrug a little  --  suppose he was exaggerating . Suppose there was nothing to it , with Leo and this girl . Suppose it was just his imagination . After all , one night , only a few hours  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to be nice to her . Maybe his proposition was something else entirely . And even if it was n't , even if Leo 's intentions were really what Norman suspected  --  well , chances were it would n't ever come to anything anyway . What reason was there to suppose that the girl herself would co-operate ? She seemed sort of impressed with Leo tonight , of course  --  but she was the type of girl who probably gets impressed with plenty of people . A small-town girl all alone in New York for the first time in her life , all full of her freedom and her excitement and everything , it was only natural for her to make a fuss over a young man like Leo . But after she was in New York awhile , after he 'd been taking her out awhile , after the novelty had all worn off  --  well , chances were she 'd go right back to Omaha and marry one of the boys she knew in grammar school . So it was silly , just plain silly , to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told himself . Hasty actions , half-baked deci-106 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGsions , they never . got anybody anywhere . I 'll wait and watch and see what happens . " What do you think about her , Norman ? " Aunt Ruth suddenly broke into his thoughts . " She 's a charming girl , do n't you agree ? " With a little smile , Norman agreed . And then , as the conversation moved past him , he hunched down in his chair and began to polish his glasses .  --  But it really would have been so nice , he thought , to go out and buy some new suits. 7BY THE TIME HE WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNing , Norman 's decision had crystallized . He would wait two weeks . Two weeks exactly , not a single day more , without saying a word to Leo or doing a thing . By the end of that time , Leo most likely would n't even be seeingthe girl any more . But if he was . . . well , without another moment 's delay , Norman would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this , and nothing could make him change his decision , he would simply put the matter out of his mind and go about his life as usual . Only it was n't so simple , putting the matter out of his THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 107mind . Somehow there was always something to forceit right back in again . There was the telephone ringingand Leo 's voice , " Hello , is that you , honey ?  --  A harpsichordrecital ?  --  Well , of course I will , you know howcrazy I am over the harpsichord  --  " There was Mother'sconstant chatter , Brenda this , Brenda that , " didyou see the coat that dear Brenda was wearing lastnight ? Two Cadillacs they have back in Omaha , canyou imagine that , two Cadillacs ! "  --  And at night , lateat night as Norman lay awake in the darkness , there was the sound of the front door opening , and Leo'sstep in the foyer , heavy and generally a little unsteady . But most of all , there was brotherly love . This was thething that kept the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo was full of brotherlylove these next two weeks . He went out of his wayto tell Norman all about his plans , to pour out his contoshare his delight and triumph at every newdevelopment . Every morning at breakfast , every eveningas he dressed to go out for dinner , and sometimeslate at night if he could catch Norman out of his room , Leo issued a detailed report on his affair with BrendaGoldhill . And when he was all through with it , with hisdaily descriptions of their visits to concerts and museums , their affectionately cultured conversations andrefined necking , he would laugh and slap Norman onthe back and cry out , " How do you like that , Normie ? 108 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGThe girl is crazy about me ! You know I 'm the most modest soul who ever lived , but by God I ca n't get around it , she absolutely worships me ! " And he would n't be satisfied , he would n't drop the subject , until Norman had smiled back at him and murmured some words of approval . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these indirectreports of the affair  --  these were bad enough , Heaven knows , but they were only a small part of Norman'storture . Leo insisted on inflicting the girl herself on Norman . " I want you two to like each other , " he said , and he brought them together as much as possible . He invited Norman for dinner , and badgered him and kidded him until he accepted the invitation . He brought the girl around to the office at noon , and they dragged Norman off to lunch , where he was obliged to listen to the light , offhand way they talked to each other and to watch their private little smiles and winks , full of the suggestion of a whole lifetime of intimacies between them . And on week ends there was less peace for Normanthan ever  --  concerts , shopping trips , treks through art galleries , Norman was maneuvered into taggingalong at all of these . Tagging along for a few hours , that is , because there always came a moment when Leo took him aside and whispered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now if you do n't mind  --  you know how it is  --  " T H E G O O D- F O R - N O T H I N G 109 What was there that was so painful about this ? Nor- man had difficulty understanding it himself . It was n't that he particularly disliked the girl . Under any other circumstances , he would n't have minded her company at all . She was very young , younger than her years , and a little silly , and she liked to hear herself talk , and she supposed that other people liked it too  --  and really it was n't fair to judge her harshly right now , because her life was too full of ideas that she did n't quite un- derstand , and activities that she thought she ought to enjoy , and people who seemed to know so much more than she and made her feel like a terrible dope . In an- other few years she would be a different person com- pletely , a respectable housewife in Omaha , an active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of several lovely children . A much nicer person too , Norman thought , because already she was sort of sweet , and with everything else she had picked up from her Greenwich Village friends , he had never once heard her make a snotty remark or repeat a nasty piece of gos- sip about anyone . Well , as the days went by it got harder and harder for Norman to hide it from himself that things were n't turning out as he expected . The novelty was n't wearing off , the affair was n't petering out , Leo was seeing more and more of the girl every day  --  and more and more often Norman caught her gazing up at Leo with110 T H E GOO D- F O R - N O T H I N Gthat bright look in her eyes . He began to count the days , and then the hours , until that two weeks would be up . And the night before , he made himself a solemn promise . Tomorrow morning , he promised himself ; tomorrow morning without fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Leo had come in very late the night before , and it was impossible to get him out of bed , to shake the sleep out of him so that he could carry on a serious discussion . And what 's the point of speaking to him if he misses half of what you say ? The truth is , that would be worse than not speaking at all . Wait till tonight , wait till you get home from the office . But the night came , and Norman got home from the office , and Leo was in a terrible hurry , getting ready for an early dinner with Brenda . They were going to the opera , and he was dressing up , and of course he mislaidhis cuff links and he could n't tie his bow tie , and then there was n't time for two words , he had to be runningright off . What does it matter ? Norman told himself . One day more or less , it does n't matter at all . I 'll do it tomorrow . Tomorrow without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreal time for Norman . For tomorrow the conditions were ideal . Leo was up for breakfast , and he was cheerful , and he was even rather quiet as he ate his eggs . A dozen perfect openings presented themselves , a dozen opportunities toT H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N G 111slip right into the touchy subject , and do it naturally and easily too . But every time , as Norman was on the verge of doing it  --  every time there was a sudden tightening in his stomach , and he let the moment pass . Tonight , tonight , he said to himself finally . I 'll feel betterabout it tonight . And he rushed off to the office . Tonight , tonight ! Or tomorrow morning , tomorrow without fail !  --  These were the words that ran through his head continually in the next few days . He repeated them to himself like some magic formula , and for a while they did their work . It 's a nuisance , he told himself regularly , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up , something always seems to interfere . Mother is in the room , or Leo is in a hurry , or the  --  the atmosphere is n't quite right . Or something . Well , tomorrow my luck will be better . I feel sure of it , I have n't a doubt of it . Tomorrow morning , absolutely without  --  And then one day he realized that a week had passed . A whole week since the deadline he had set for himself . Leo was going out every night now , and Brenda'seyes were brighter than ever , and still he had n't done a thing . His honesty could n't be held down any longer . He could n't pretend any longer that he did n't see the truth . He was a coward . There had n't been any interferences , there was n't anything wrong with the atmosphere  --  it was himself , it was his own fault , he112 T H E G O O D - F O R- N O THIN Gwas deliberately postponing the moment . And why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone through this routine with Leo before , had n't he , many many times before ? So what on earth was he frightened about this time ? Do n't be a weakling ! he told himself , throwing his shoulders back and lifting his chin and unconsciouslytaking on a little the look of his Aunt Ruth . Stop all this nonsense , and take yourself in hand ! But still he postponed . Take yourself in hand  --  yes , yes , of course , he was determined to do it , he definitelywould do it  --  but not right now , not this minute  --  tomorrow would do just as well , would n't it ? In this manner another week went by , a wretched miserable week in which he was constantly polishing his glasses , and he made five different mistakes on Mr. Kleinman 's books . Finally , one Thursday night , he could n't go on with it any longer . There comes a moment when , no matter how often a man has postponed an unpleasant duty , he simply goes ahead and does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature deliberation , not with his head held high and a firm resolvein his breast  --  but all at once , with his eyes shut and a deep breath and a weary " What the hell ! " he pulls off the adhesive tape , or takes the plunge into the cold water , or marches into the boss 's office and blurts out his demand for a raise . And so , on this particular Thursday , Norman kissedT H E G O O D- F O R- N O T H I N G 113Mother good night , turned off all the lights in the living room except for one standing lamp , and sank into an easy chair . There he would wait , he would wait all night if necessary , until Leo got back from his date. 8AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING , NORMAN was startled out of a slight doze by the sound of the front door opening . A moment later he heard Leo 's voice in the foyer . Softly and a little thickly , Leo was singing to himself : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The singing stopped short , and Norman could see Leo 's figure , tall and blurred in the darkness of the archway . " Who 's there ? Who 's there ? " Leo called out . After a few seconds of fumbling , his fingers found the light switch , and Norman blinked in the sudden glare . " Oh , it 's you , Grandma dear , " Leo said , with a broad grin on his face . " Nice of you to wait up for me . Very reassuring to know that there 's always a light in the window . " Norman wet his lips , tightened himself a little , and started in : " I wanted to talk to you , Leo . That 's why I waited up . " 114 T H E GOO D- F O R - N O THIN G " Wanted to talk with me . " Leo put on a look of exaggerateddistress , and made a clucking noise with his tongue . " He 's using his Certified Public Accountant voice tonight . I 'm about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sinister . ' What time is it ? " Norman looked at his watch . " After two o'clock , " he said , a little surprised at how late it was . " After two o'clock . " Leo 's expression of distress changed to one of surprise , also much exaggerated . " Feeble old lady like you , staying up till after two o'clock . Merely to talk with me . Sinisterer and sinisterer . " His tongue caught on the words , and finally he pushed them aside with a gesture , and grinned again . " Say , is there really such a word , I wonder  --  sinis-terer ? " " If you could sit down , Leo , " Norman said . " And be serious for a moment . " " Serious ? " Leo 's expression immediately became very serious . " Never more serious in my life . In fact , that 's just what I need , " and he started across the room with a slightly weaving motion , " a good stiff serious drink . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-ready ? " At the liquor cabinet Leo stopped , stroked his chin , and frowned thoughtfully . " Yes , " he said , giving a nod of his head . " Yes , I think I have . " And he poured himself a jigger of whiskey and drained it down in a gulp . THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 115Then he turned to face Norman , smiling broadly and swaying a little on his heels . " All right , Normie , I 'm fortified . Sorry I talked to you like I did . Sorry I called you feeble old lady . You 're the finest brother a fellow ever had , and if you want to be serious , go ahead , be serious to your heart 's content . Only  --  really wish you did n't have to be too serious . Seems a pity , after the serious evening I just went through . " " You were with Brenda , were n't you ? " " And a select group of artistic friends . " Leo chuckled to himself at the thought of it . " Sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our shoes off , and discussed modern poetry . Those intellectuals  --  very surprising , big surprise to me . Not nearly so frightening as they 're cracked up to be . Practically human , in fact . Lots of liquor , some very good-looking girls  --  have to admit it . You 'd be amazed , absolutely amazed , what it does for a girl , sitting on the floor and discussing modern poetry . Brings out her  --  her  --  " Norman cleared his throat . " That 's more or less why I wanted to talk with you , Leo . " " About those good-looking girls on the floor ? Why Normie , you astound me . " Leo 's grin grew broader , and he nodded his head approvingly . " Very pleased , though . Pleased to hear you 're finally taking an interest in the serious affairs of life . " And he winked his eye in a way which made Norman go on talking quickly. 11G T H E GOO D- F O R- N O T H I N G " About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " My relationship ' with Brenda . Ah yes . Wonderful age we 're living in , is n't it . Nobody just goes around with anybody any more  --  they have a relationship : All right , all right , Normie , give me a chance to sit down , get myself set , on your mark  --  " Leo fell heavilyonto the sofa and stretched out his legs  --  " Go ! What about it , our relationship ? " " I do n't know how to put it exactly . I 've been thinking about it a great deal lately . To tell the truth , I 've been thinking about it almost constantly . " Norman passed his hand over his eyes . Suddenly he was tired , terribly tired  --  maybe he should have waited till the morning . But with a shake of his head , he made himselfgo on with it . " And I 've been hoping that I 'm wrong about this , believe me . " " Words , words , words , " said Leo , with a wide lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Normie . Truth is , I 'm just a little bit dizzy right now . " " The point is  --  " Norman leaned forward  --  " ever since Aunt Ruth had us up for dinner a month ago , you 've been seeing a lot of Brenda , have n't you ? Dinners , theaters , art galleries in the afternoon . I do n't like to spy on you , you know that  --  or keep track of your private life  --  but you have made it pretty difficult for me not to notice what 's going on , and  --  T H E G O O D- F O R- N O T H I N G 117 well , what I 've been wondering  --  I 've been wondering about it more and more every day  --  are you fond of that girl , Leo ? Are you thinking seriously about marry- ing her ? " For a while Leo did n't answer this . He just leaned back and smiled and looked very sleepy and comfort- able . " Marrying , " he said at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Still , it comes to most of us sooner or later , does n't it ? Why should I hide the truth from you ? You 're my brother  --  great big brother  --  who else should I share my joy with ? " Leo crossed his legs and nodded his head , especially pleased with himself . " Yes , yes , yes . Hit the nail on the head . Am thinking seriously about marrying her . " " Yes  --  that 's what I assumed . " It was what he as- sumed . And yet , hearing it right out like that , direct from Leo 's mouth , Norman felt just a little stunned for a moment . He had to wet his lips before he could go on . " In that case , Leo , I have to know  --  it 's painful for both of us , but the question has to be asked  --  what do you see in her ? " Leo did n't act the least bit perturbed or embarrassed . He just laughed and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever heard one . What does any man see in her  --  any woman , that is ? One point of view , the answer 's simple , any first-year biology student 'll give it to you . Another point of view , not so simple  --  great-118 T H E G O O D - F O R- N O T H I N Gest mystery in the world  --  inspiration of poets  --  lifetimestudy of psychologists  --  " " Yes , that 's quite true , " Norman said . " But this is a special case  --  you certainly see that , do n't you ? Becauseyou ca n't deny it , she is  --  well , somewhat of a contrast with the kind of girl you 're usually interested in . She 's a college graduate , her parents are respectable people , she 's been brought up more or less like everybody else we know . And the fact is , the girls you 've taken out in the past have always been a little on the  --  " For a second Norman searched for the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they always seem to have come from much more sophisticated  --  you might say , unconventional  --  backgrounds . " " As I understand this , what you 're getting at , you do n't think Brenda is my type . Is that it ? " Leo 's smile made Norman lower his eyes . He was so obviously having the time of his life , enjoying the situationheartily . " Yes . That 's it . That 's part of it . " " Granted , Normie , " Leo said , with a wave of his hand . " Freely granted . In fact , I insist on it , absolutely insist . There you have it , one of the most amazing phenom  --  phenom  --  phenom-en-enons that I ever met up with . Believe it or not , I seem to have changed my type . For some reason  --  great big puzzle to me , I assure you  --  suddenly find I 'm interested in a new type  --  type that 's been brought up like everybody elseT H E GOOD - F O R- N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , sweet refined domestic type  --  that 's the type interests me these days . Now is n't that amazing ? " And Leo smiled brightly , like a schoolboy waiting for praise from his teacher . " Yes , yes , I see that , " Norman said . " But I 'm still wondering , Leo  --  what 's the reason for this change ? What is it that 's suddenly turned you along these domesticlines ? If you can only answer that  --  " And in spite of himself , a pleading note crept into Norman 's voice . " All I want is a reasonable answer  --  " " What is it ? " Leo shrugged elaborately . " How can I answer such a question without making you think I 'm vain and conceited ? How can I tell you , what 's going on in me is a reju  --  rejuvenation ? That 's what it is  --  very appropriate word . Complete rejuvenation and overhauling . New feelings , new ambitions , new tastes  --  words of one syllable , becoming a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better for a new man "  --  a pleasant , faintly mischievous look came over Leo 's face at this  --  " than the healthy , wholesome , uplifting influenceof a new woman ? " " But why Brenda ? " Norman said , a little more urgently . " That 's all I 'd like to know . Why have you decided to become a new man with this particular girl ? " " Why not ? " The more urgent Norman became , themore Leo became calm and self-satisfied . " Do n't follow120 T H E GOOD - F O R - N O T H I N Gyou there . What 's wrong with her ? Why , always thought you liked her , Normie . Always thought so . She likes you . Always telling me what a sweet , kindhearted , simple soul she thinks you 've got . Says you remind her of her dear old Aunt Henrietta  --  " " There 's nothing wrong with her , Leo , " Norman said , with an impatient wave of his hand . " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , I suppose . She 's like a lot of girls nowadays . Except for one thing  --  Well , I see I 'll have to be more blunt and outspoken . I do n't want to be , believe me I do n't . It 's the money that 's been bothering me . It 's the girl 's financial position . " " Her financial position ! Normie , you surprise me . Never would 've thought it of you . Always thought you were the broad-minded , democratic type . Prejudiced against a girl just because you think she does n't have enough money  --  that 's the sort of attitude I 'd expectfrom one of our snobbish old aunts ! Well , better put your mind at ease , I suppose . Hate to encourage your intolerant instincts , but I better tell you right now  --  Brenda does have money . Yes , she does . Plenty of money  --  piles of money  --  more money than you or me ever had in our whole lives  --  " " I know she has money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leo . Please try and concentrate  --  it 's important to me . " Very slowly and clearly he brought out his next words , as if he wereTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 121talking to a small child : " It 's not her being poor that I 'm worried about , do n't you see ? It 's her being rich . " " Her being rich ! Excuse me , I lost you , far behind you . One minute you do n't want her to be poor , next minute do n't want her to be rich . Illogical , completely illogical . Also unfair  --  holding the poor girl 's money against her . " " I 'm not holding her money against her , " said Norman , in a louder voice . " You 're confusing me , Leo  --  I 'm all mixed up . I do n't have any feelings at all about her money . It 's you I 'm thinking of  --  what are your feelings about her money ? " " Do n't follow you . " Leo made himself look very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feels like everybodys else 's money . " " Leo , please ! What I want to know is  --  do you like it , the fact that Brenda has money ? " " Well , naturally I like it . Do n't you like it ? Should n't everybody like it ? Would n't think much of the man did n't like it . Man 's got to have a pretty mean dispositionto feel bitter just because of somebody else 's good luck . " " I mean  --  do you like the money part of it ? " Normancould n't stay seated any more . He was too intent on getting an answer out of Leo  --  he had to pace up and down and use his arms freely . " Does her money interest you  --  well , for its own sake ? " 122 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING " What other sake should it interest me ? When you get out into the big wide world , Normie  --  excuse my sayingit  --  think you 'll find that money 's a subject most people take a certain interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money interest you exclusively ? I mean  --  if she did n't have any money , would you still be interested in her ? " " Why not ? Lots of people I 'm interested in do n't have money . You know me , Normie  --  sharp eye , lively imagination , adaptable temperament . I can find something to interest me in almost everybody . " " For Heaven 's sake , Leo ! " Norman stopped in front of him , and cried out in exasperation , " You must know what I 'm driving at ! If Brenda did n't happen to be rich , would you still want to marry her ! " It was out in the open now , and no way for Leo to wriggle away from it . Immediately Norman felt a little embarrassed . He looked down at the floor as he waited for Leo 's answer . But when Leo 's voice came , it was just as calm and cool and unruffled as before : " Normie , Normie , good old Normie . When 're you going to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , columnsof figures , that 's all you public accountants know what to do with . If such-and-such was true , would I do so-and-so ? Maybe I would , maybe I would n't . Maybe if she was n't rich , would n't be the girl she is today  --  would n't have the same refined manners , same pleasantT H E GOO D- F O R- N O T H I N G 123personality , same healthy red cheeks , same culture and education . Maybe , maybe , maybe . But the fact is  --  no maybe 's about it  --  she does have all those things , is rich , and I want to marry her . " Norman looked up at him again , at that quiet unflusteredsmile , so sure of itself , so amused at everybody else 's discomfort . " You 're evading the issue , Leo , " Normansaid , in a tight , restrained voice . " You 're being very clever and fluent and all  --  but you 're evading the issue . And there 's only one reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it , I 've been miserable about it for weeks  --  but what else can I think , what alternativedo you give me ? You do n't really care for that girl at all . You 're deliberately being nice to her , deliberately making her fall in love with you . You want to marry her for her money . " " Now now , Normie . " Leo shook his finger playfully . " How many times have I talked to you about these high-school dramatics of yours  --  " Norman had started back to his seat  --  but now he stopped and turned slowly and gave Leo a long look . When he spoke , his voice was very low , but only because he was struggling hard to hold in his feelings . " I do n't know what to say . I just do n't know . It was n't much more than a month ago that we had our talk . It was after that business at the club . You were so ashamed of yourself then . You were truly sorry for124 T H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I N Gwhat you 'd done . You made me a solemn promise  --  I could 've sworn that you really meant it . I was so happy , Leo . For a whole week I was like a young boy again . I 'm not really so old , when you get right down to it  --  " But this was too painful , and Norman broke off quickly . A moment later he spoke again , a little more loudly . " And now it starts again . The same dishonesty . The same irresponsibility . Only worse  --  so much worse . A month ago it was only people 's money  --  it was only a game of cards . But now it 's this poor girl 's feelings . Her deepest feelings  --  " " Honesty , dishonesty  --  " Leo waved them over his shoulder . " Way you toss those words around , Normie , just as if you thought they were your own personal property . Excuse me , makes a man thirsty , makes a man crave a little drink . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet , and made his way to the liquor cabinet , not quite in a straight line . When he had finished pouring his drink and gulping it off , he turned back to Norman , and his smile was n't so pleasant and friendly now . There was a certain little curl in it that had n't been there before . " Maybe there 's some people do n't feel the same as you , Normie . Ever think of that ? Maybe there 's some people are n't above a little dishonestythemselves . " Norman looked at him uncertainly . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 125 " What about the family  --  maybe that 's what I 'm talking about ? " Leo 's smile grew more insinuating , and he nodded his head . " Yes , yes , our family , that 's the family I mean . Aunt Ruth and Uncle Myron and the whole bunch of them . How do you suppose I ever managed to meet this girl ? Whose idea do you suppose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do you supposehave been working like little beavers all along  --  working a lot harder than I am , incidentally  --  to push this thing through ? " " The family ? " Norman said , in a weak voice . " Nobody else . And as long as we 're on the subject , might as well hear the whole truth . What do you supposewe 're going to all this trouble for , the family and me ? Doing it for our own selfish personal interests ? " Leo shook his head . " No , no , no . Not at all . " He sat down on the sofa and stretched out his legs again . " We 're doing it , Normie , for you . " " For me ? " Norman did n't really catch the meaning of Leo 's words . He was still staggering under Leo 's first surprise . So the family was in on it too , the family was scheming and planning behind his back , " for poor Norman'sown good "  --  he could hear them saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of himself . . . " Yes , of course , this explained a great many things . How come he had n't seen it before ? " For your future happiness , that 's why we 're doing1 2 6 T HE GO O D - F OR - NO T H I N Cit , " Leo was saying . " So that you can be on your own , and independent , and do n't have to worry about money any more . So that I can be in a position to help you , take some of the load off your shoulders , give you a chance to relax and enjoy yourself . There 's the whole truth , nothing but the truth  --  and I happen to be big enough so that I do n't expect one word of apology or grati  --  gratitude . " " You 're doing a thing like this for me ? " Slowly it was beginning to dawn on him , the full implications of the situation . " You and the family ? It 's for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little shake of his head . " I do n't know what to tell you . I suppose you mean well by it  --  I appreciate the kindness  --  but listen to me , Leo  --  it 's got to stop . It 's wrong . It 's a terrible thing to do . I ca n't allow it . " " Ca n't allow it . " Leo laughed . " Come on now , Normie , that 's a pretty highhanded statement , is n't it ? After all , when all 's said and done , what 've you go to do with it anyway ? Whose business is it , yours or ours ? " " I wo n't stand for it , Leo , " Norman said , growing more excited . " It 's no good giving me your tricky arguments . You simply ca n't go on with it . Lying to that girl  --  leading her on like this . " Leo straightened up in his seat , and turned his smile on Norman directly . " Very noble of you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind myTHE GO OD-FOR- NOTHING 127mentioning it , Normie , seems to me you 're making this great big gesture a little bit late , are n't you ? Seems to me , if you felt so responsible for the girl , why did n't you speak up a long time ago ? Ca n't tell me that you just this minute found out what we were up to . Oh no ! " Leo gave a loud , harsh laugh . " You guessed it the first night , I 'll take bets on that . Guessed the whole thing , watched the developments day by day for more than a month , and kept your mouth shut . Tight shut  --  no trouble at all about letting this terrible thing go right on . All wrapped up in your newspaper , or your columns of figures , or your account books  --  perfect excuse for pushing all this dishonesty and irresponsibility right out of your mind . Now do n't you pretend that it is n't so . " Norman shook his head . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But his voice was feeble . " Course you did ! " Leo made a wide gesture , and suddenly his smile was bright and affectionate again . Sincerely , genuinely affectionate at that  --  Norman knew it , and as usual it was the most difficult part of the whole thing . " And why the hell not ? " Leo went on . " What 's to feel guilty about ? Perfectly normal , natural human reaction . Nice things , high living , lots of money in your pocket  --  you 'd like all that the same as the rest of us . And you know you 're going to have plenty of it soon as I 'm legally tied up to my rich father-in-law. 128 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGNothing at all to be ashamed of . Personal opinion , it 's the best thing in the world could happen to you . About time you sowed a few wild oats , made a damn fool of yourself when it wo n't cost you more than a slight hangover . Fact is , I 'll be looking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be rooting for you every minute . My brother , are n't you ? All right , why is n't my brother entitled to a little happiness in life ?  --  Now if you do n't mind , better get to bed . " Once more , with some difficulty , Leo struggled to his feet . " Otherwise , might very well be sick . Not too much liquor , understand . " He smiled and winked his eye . " Too much virtue . Average man 's digestive tract can only stand a certain amount of virtue  --  " He turned and started to the archway . Norman still did n't have himself under control  --  but he made himself speak out anyway . " Just a minute , Leo . " Leo turned in the archway and blinked at him . " Maybe you 're right , " Norman said . " Maybe I have n't acted the way I should have . Maybe I did shut my eyes to what was happening . And what you said about liking nice things  --  maybe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God knows I do n't think so  --  but maybe , maybe  --  Anyway , that 's all in the past . It 's over and done with , Leo , I 'd better warn you right now . No more keeping quiet , and being selfish and cowardly and all . FromTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 129now on I 'm putting my foot down . If you wo n't stop this disgraceful business with Brenda Goldhill  --  well , I 'll stop it myself . I 'll give away the whole scheme . I 'll tell the girl everything . " " Normie , Normie . " Leo gave a good-natured smile . " If you could only see how you look ! I 'm sorry , Normie , but  --  but  --  " And he puckered up his face for one of his imitations . " He 'll give away the whole scheme  --  he 'll tell the girl everything  --  Leo Kramer , you must stop this disgraceful business ! What passion ! What violence ! What a performancel " " It 's no , performance ! " Norman cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down to Greenwich Village  --  I 'll go right up to her apartment ! I wo n't even go to the office  --  " " Good for you , Normie ! Spending too much time in that stuffy old office anyhow ! Be a hero , have a good enjoyable fury , work that high moral tone for all it 's worth  --  you 'll feel better for it in the morning ! " " It 's no joke , it 's no joke ! Believe me , Leo , I 'm going to do what I say ! " " Sure you are , who said you would n't ? And after you 've done it , Normie , you and me can discuss the question of finding you a nice rich wife of your own . " Chuckling softly to himself , Leo turned and weaved out of the room . " A nice rich wife of my own  --  ! " Norman repeated130 THE GOOD - FOR-NOTHINGthe words in amazement . And then he shuddered . Good Heavens , he told himself , Leo is terrible ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been wrong with me all these years ? My own younger brother  --  and he 's a terrible terrible person ! But suddenly a little part of himself , way down deep inside him , seemed to whisper to him , And what about you ? Was n't it true , what he told you ? Did n't you keep your mouth shut for a whole month ? Were n't you perfectly willing to let him go ahead and do what he wanted to do ? And underneath all your fretting and your worrying , were n't you sort of hoping that he 'd be successful ? In other words , you 're just as terrible as he is  --  No , that 's not true ! Norman interrupted himself with a vigorous shake of his head . At least  --  it is n't true any more . And to reinforce this decision , he did somethingthat he very seldom cared to do  --  he went over to the liquor cabinet and poured himself a drink . PART THREETHE FIRST THING NORMAN DID AFTER HEwoke up was to call Brenda at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She told him that she would be working at her magazine all morning , but she offered to meet him for lunch  --  " I know a lovely little French place right near my office . " She was also very curious and very concerned about what he wanted , and in between her ecstatic descriptions of that " little French place , " she asked him a great many anxious questions . But Norman repeated several times that he 'd rather not talk over the phone , and finally he hung up . Then he gave a sigh of relief . He was committed now  --  he could n't avoid seeing her even if he wanted to . A few minutes later , while he was making his breakfast , he heard Leo 's bedroom door open . And then he heard Leo in the living room , dialing the telephone . Norman knew what that was all about . The inevitable SOS to the family  --  in an hour or so , they would all come pouncing down on him , with arguments and shrieks and wild gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H E GOOD - F O R - N O T H I N G Gpected . He knew what he was letting himself in for when he made his decision . And yet  --  if only it could be avoided  --  if only he could sneak off somewhereaway from all the fuss and the fuming , pop out just long enough to say his piece to Brenda , and pop right back into hiding again . Leo 's telephoning was over , and he came striding into the kitchen and greeted Norman with his usual heartiness . Norman murmured an answer and bent over his coffee . Fortunately further embarrassment was preventedby the appearance of Mother , and the next half hour was given over to assuring her that he was staying home from the office today simply because he did n't feel like working and not because he was deathly ill . " But you must be ill , Norman dear , " she kept saying . " Otherwise why would n't you feel like working ? " They were still debating the question when the familyarrived . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead , with her chin high , and behind her Aunt Hannah , Aunt Fanny , Cousin Seymour ( Aunt Fanny 's bachelor son , who was working for the Stock Exchange ) , and Uncle Myron bringing up the rear . One by one they filed into the living room , muttered a short " Good morning , " and grimly took a seat . But much as they may have wanted to burst right out with what was on their minds , they could n't do it while Mother was around . She was overjoyed , and com-T H E GOOD-FOR- N O T H I N G 135pletely flustered , by their arrival . She flitted here and there fetching them cigarettes , she offered to make them coffee and would n't take no for an answer , and once the coffee was on she kept running back and forth between the living room and the kitchen to check up on whether it was boiling . " You know , it 's after ten-thirty , " Aunt Ruth said to her . " Do n't you usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Plenty of time , plenty of time , " Mother said , and rushed out to the kitchen to see how the coffee was doing . Finally it was ready , and she brought in the cups and the coffee table , and made sure that everybody got served , and asked everybody how they liked it , and nodded her head and said , " Oh , I 'm so glad ! " even after Aunt Fanny told her , " It 's much too strong  --  I do n't like to think what it 'll do to my heart . " Then , for a little while , Mother ran out of breath , and just smiled around at everybody while they sipped their coffee . And then she gave a happy little sigh and said , " This is so pleasant , is n't it ? All of us gathered together like this , having an interesting conversation . All members of one close , affectionate family . Dear Ruth and Myron  --  and all of you , every one of you  --  I ca n't tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have some more coffee , Seymour dear ? " 136 T H E GOOD -F O R - N O T H I N GCousin Seymour cleared his throat , and spoke , as he always did , as if he were issuing an official announcement : " No , thank you , Aunt Nettie . I 'm expected at the Exchange later today  --  at eleven-thirty sharp , to be exact  --  and too much caffeine , I find , impairs my stamina . " " Talking about time , " said Aunt Ruth , " you 're sure you wo n't be late for that lecture , Nettie ? " " Plenty of time , I said . " Mother leaned back and smiled sort of wistfully . " I 'd just like to sit here for the rest of the morning , enjoying my coffee , chatting with my family . I suppose it 's all my imagination or something , but this past month or so , it seems as if people have been coming up to visit me so much more often than ever before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . " " That 's very interesting , " Aunt Ruth said . " But if you feel that you ought to be running along , you certainly must n't let us  --  " " In the old days , of course , " Mother went on , " when we lived downtown in our penthouse , I mean  --  what busy exciting times we used to have . People droppingin and out every minute , taking a bite to eat , exchanginga little news . You remember , Ruth , how it used to be ? And then poor Harry died  --  and we had to move up here  --  and everything seemed to change somehow . Oh , I went on seeing the family  --  THE GOOD - FOR - NOTHING 137thank Heavens , I 've never stopped seeing the family . Only somehow it seems as if I 'm always seeing you down at your homes  --  and it 's really so seldom that you ever get to visit me up at my home . Until this past month , this wonderful wonderful month . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's almost like the old days all over again . " Mother broke off with a blush and a giggle . " Oh , I 'm sure it 's my imagination ! " " I 'm sure of it too , Nettie , " Aunt Ruth said . " Insteadof talking a lot of nonsense , you 'd much better get off to your lecture . Enjoy yourself , improve your mind . " " Yes , I will . You 're perfectly right , Ruth dear . I 'll just gulp down this last drop of coffee . There you are ! And now I 'm off . Unless somebody wants another cup . Does anybody want another cup ? " There was unanimous agreement that nobody wanted another cup . " Well , all right , " Mother said . " And now I am off  --  I really am . " " I 'll walk you to the door , " Norman said , getting up and going over to her . " Oh yes , thank you , Norman dear . You 'll forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of nonsense ? It 's just that I 'm in such a funny mood lately . Sort of lightheadedand way up in the air . Really , it 's as if I was a little girl again .

I 've been going to my lectures more conscientiously than ever . But I just ca n't seem to keep a serious thought in my head . " " It 's spring in the air , " said Aunt Ruth . " Nothing to worry about . I feel like that myself sometimes  --  lightheadedand girlish . The best cure for it is to get out of the apartment and attend to your business . " " Yes , you 're right , Ruth dear . That 's exactly what I 'm going to do . " With her hand on Norman 's arm , she started to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning it 's been , I really hate to leave . Only one thing to keep it from being perfect .

Genuine diamonds , I 'm perfectly sure of it !  --  Really , I feel as close to that girl as if she were one of the fam-ily . " " Good-bye , Nettie ! " Ruth said , a little sharply . " You 're going to be late ! " " No , I 'm not . I wo n't be late , Ruth dear . I 'll take a cab . Norman tells me it 's a little extravagant "  --  she looked up at Norman shyly  --  " but really I get so mixed up in the subway .

" They went out to the foyer , and as he was helping her on with her coat , Mother said to Norman in a low voice , " Norman dear  --  I did n't want to say it in front of Leo  --  I did n't want to embarrass him . But about this Goldhill girl  --  dear Brenda , I mean . Do you suppose there 's a chance  --  I mean , that Leo could be taking a serious interest in this girl ? What do you think about it , Norman dear ? " " Would you like that , Mother ? " Norman said , unable to bring himself to look into her face . " Would I like it ! Oh Norman , you do n't know how much I 'd like it , you do n't know how I hope and pray for it ! If only Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married and settle down . I 've been so worried about him lately . About his future and his happiness . It does seem as if there are fewer and fewer people all the time who can appreciate him , and I 've been worriedthat it 's preying on his mind , that the poor boy is becoming discouraged and embittered . " " Discouraged and embittered ? " Norman smiled to himself . " Do n't worry , Mother . Do n't trouble yourself . Leo will be all right , I promise you . " " Do you think so , dear ? Yes , you 're right , I suppose . I 'm being a silly old woman . Still , I do hope there 's a140 T H E G O O D- F O R- N O THIN Gchance with this girl . Do you think so , Norman ? Do you think there 's a chance ? " But luckily she did n't bother to wait for his answer . She looked at her watch , and gave a little squeal , and hurried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , trying to get hold of himself . I 've made my decision , he kept tellinghimself . I 've made it , and it 's over with , and I must n't let anything shake me . Still , it did n't help him any to hear Aunt Fanny 's wail , loud and mournful , from the living room : " Poor Nettie , she is n't getting any younger ! Well , we all have to face it some day  --  " 10ALL RIGHT , ENOUGH SCHMOOSING ALREADY ! " Uncle Myron got to his feet and waved for silence . In a ragged manner , the family came to order . " Now let 's say what we came for , and get it over with . " " I know what you came for , Uncle Myron , " Norman said , returning to his chair and clasping his hands together in his lap . " Leo told me the whole story last night . " A grumble went up from the family . Aunt HannahTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 141looked mildly reproachful , and Aunt Fanny shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nothing ever turns out the way you want it to . I should know , God knows  --  " Aunt Ruth , of course , was indignant : " Leo , Leo ! Always Leo ! Whenever there 's a fly in the soup , you can be sure that his name is Leo ! " Leo acknowledged Aunt Ruth 's remark with a little bow . " It was my lifelong respect for the truth that did me in , Auntie dear . The weight of our mutual deception "  --  he put just the slightest emphasis on " mutual "  --  " was simply too heavy for me to bear . " " Your lifelong respect for the truth ! " Aunt Ruth was quite red in the face at this . " Your lifelong idiocy is more like it ! Not even enough sense to keep his mouth shut when it 's for his own good ! " " Do n't blame Leo , Aunt Ruth , " Norman said . " I 'm glad he did n't keep his mouth shut . I 'm glad he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for quite a while now . Only I was fooling myself  --  I told myself it would n't last , I told myself there was nothing in it . My reasons  --  well , it does n't matter . Thank God that 's all over now . It 's only fair to tell you that it wo n't do you any good to argue with me . My mind is made up , and nothing can change it . " The family muttered . Cousin Seymour cleared his throat and said , " Of course , I appreciate your point of view , Norman . I , after all , am a member of the same142 T H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N Ggeneration as you  --  four and a half years younger , to be precise  --  " " If you do n't mind , Mr. Morgenthau , Junior , " said Uncle Myron , " you should let me do the talking  --  " " Norman Kramer , " Aunt Ruth said , " since when do you have the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting who you are  --  easygoing , good-natured Norman Kramer that anybody can lead around by the nose ! " " All right , Ruth , " said Uncle Myron , " so keep quiet for two seconds . Did n't we decide we were going to handle this situation calm and logical ? Did n't we agree we should n't yell at him , we should reason with him ? " " What else am I doing ? I am reasoning with him ! " Aunt Ruth stuck her chin forward and shouted out , " Norman Kramer , once and for all will you call up that girl and tell her you wo n't be seeing her today ? You see . " Aunt Ruth turned back to Uncle Myron . " He wo n't listen to reason ! " " That 's a fact , Uncle Myron , " Leo said , barely suppressinga yawn , as if the whole proceedings concerned him less than anybody else in the world . " There 's no point in all this crazy reasoning . Why do n't you give poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? Ca n't you see that all he wants to do is assert himself a little , show his independence for aT H E G O O D- F O R- N O THIN G 143while ? So why do you stand in his way ? Especially since he is n't really going to do anything positive in the end ! " " Now see here , Leo , " Norman said , " I already told you  --  One by one and all together , every member of the family put in a word or two , until Uncle Myron started waving and yelling at them again . " Quiet , quiet everybody ! A lot of help I 'm getting ! One of them screams in his ear , another one smiles in his face , the rest of them make his head spin  --  who could figure out a better way to convince a man that he should agree with your point of view ? Norman my boy , if for one minute you could ignore all these old ladies and little babies  --  maybe you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any difference to you , but how about listening to me just the same ? " Norman had been all set to shake his head  --  but UncleMyron 's smile was so friendly and hopeful , and so free from its usual glint of sarcasm  --  well , he nodded his head instead . " All right , Uncle Myron . I do n't supposeit can hurt me to listen . " Uncle Myron looked very pleased , shushed angrily at Aunt Fanny , who had started a moan , and raised his finger . " Reason Number One . What you 're planning to do , my boy  --  spilling to the girl the whole truth  --  it 's no secret to you , I suppose , what the result will be ? She 's mixed up and frightened enough already , that144 T H E G O O D - F O R - N O T H I N Ggirl . You 'll frighten her off for good . She 'll never get married to Leo , never in a million years . " " But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want ? " " Naturally , naturally . " Uncle Myron sat forward . " So I 'm asking you , Norman my boy  --  are n't you maybe contradicting yourself ? Always you used to tell us how there 's nobody in the world that you care about so much as your brother Leo . Always , whenever an offhand suggestionwas made by anybody  --  for instance , like lettinghim pay his own bills or settle his own fights or crawl out of his own messes  --  always you were the first person to object . No , no , he 's my brother , ' you always said . No , no , we got to make him happy ! ' So I 'm asking you now , " and though Uncle Myron 's voice was soft , there was a sharp little gleam in his eye , the sort of gleam that appeared , Norman imagined , while he was bargaining with a difficult buyer or pulling a trick on a slippery competitor , " how can you think for one minute about breaking up Leo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the one thing that 'll make him a happy man for the rest of his life ? " " No , I 'm not contradicting myself , " Norman said , just as softly , but also just as firmly . " It 's not true that I do n't care any more for Leo 's happiness . You know that is n't true , Uncle Myron . You know there is n't anything I would n't do to make him happy . But it 's got to be honTHEGOOD-FOR-NOTHING 145est . He does n't have to hurt a poor innocent girl . If it 's a question of money , he can always come to me directly . " Uncle Myron smiled a little ironically and shook his head . " Unfortunately , Norman my boy , this is just what it is  --  it 's a question of money . And when it comes to this question , let 's be honest with ourselves , this poor innocentgirl is in a much better position to make Leo happy than you are . A fellow with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think he is living the way he 's living now  --  cooped up in this tiny apartment , without a single Cadillac to his name , without even a Brooks Brothers shirt on his back ? All these clever little card tricks he plays , and these handwriting exhibitions he gives , do you think that 's because he 's happy with the money he gets from you ? You might as well face it , if it 's really Leo 's happiness you 're after , you better let him marry that girl . And this is my ReasonNumber One . " And the rest of the family was quick with their expressions of approval . Aunt Hannah told him that really his Uncle Myron was right , and did n't he think , on the whole , it was better to agree with his Uncle Myron ? Aunt Fanny said , " Money , money , money , that 's what makes the world go round , Norman . You ca n't get away from it , us poor unfortunates that do n't have money , we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known family fact , which Aunt Fanny vehemently denied , that146 T H E G O O D- F O R- N O T H I N Gher husband , Uncle Max , had left her a small fortune in insurance policies . ) Cousin Seymour cleared his throat and said , " There 's a great deal to be said for that point of view , Norman . For example , in my experience on the Exchange  --  " It was very upsetting , the way they were all against him . Norman was n't used to it , standing up for himself against so much opposition , and the sheer impact of this new sensation made him stammer a little . Not because he was wavering , though . Not because he was any less convinced of what he wanted to do . " Maybe it 's true , Uncle Myron . Every word that you say  --  I ca n't deny it , I guess . But still  --  maybe Leo 's happiness is n't the only thing I 'm after . I mean  --  you remember what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family not being the only people in the world ? Well , Brenda Goldhillis in the world , too , is n't she ? And even if it does make Leo happy  --  it is n't right to mess up her life like that . So I 'm sorry , Uncle Myron  --  I wish I could oblige you  --  but I just ca n't accept it , your Reason Number One . " For a few minutes , the family exploded . Aunt Ruth 's voice , of course , rang out above the rest . " You see ! What did I tell you ? Look where reasoning gets you ! Tell him what to do , and do n't stop telling him until he agrees to do it  --  that 's the only kind of reasoning that certain people can understand ! " THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 147 " All right , Ruth , so I 'm not through yet , do n't get excited . " Uncle Myron shot her a dirty look , then turned back to Norman with a smile . " What you said just this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to my Reason Number Two . You 're worried about hurting the girl . All right , all right , I can follow your feelings  --  but frankly , you 're contradicting yourself again . Who says it , that if this girl marries Leo she 's going to be hurt ? She 's crazy about Leo  --  one look at her , and you can see that this is so . And is this such a terrible thing to happen , that a young girl should get married to the man she 's crazy about ? " " But how does he feel about her , Uncle Myron ? Why is he marrying her ? " " How does he feel , why is he marrying  --  what does it matter , how does it change the situation ? " Uncle Myron 's voice was n't so easy and calm any more , and the gleam in his eye was n't so sharp . " Every girl that married a man who felt the right way about her , did she necessarily end up happy ? Are there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two or three examples that I 'm familiar with  --  The point is , you ca n't predict the future in this world of ours . Suppose you talk her out of marrying Leo now . So maybe two years from now she 'll meet a fellow that 's even worse , or she 'll fall in love with a fellow that is n't willing to marry her , or she wo n't meet any more fellows at all  --  148 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGand so you 'll end up messing her life up even worse than if you let her marry Leo . " Norman was more confused than ever . He shook his head back and forth , and squeezed his hands together . " But the way you put it , Uncle Myron  --  it 's a hopeless position . If I do interfere , she 'll be unhappy . If I do n't interfere , she 'll be unhappy . " " Maybe so . But at least it would n't be because of something you did . Do n't do nothing , and you wo n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " Uncle Myron nodded his head and puffed his cigar , to emphasize his philosophy of life . Then he went on quickly , " Besides which , even if you ca n't predictthe future , it 's no trick to predict the present . If you 're looking for an absolutely positive guaranteed way of hurting that girl , believe me , all you got to do is tell her the truth about Leo . So there it is , " and Uncle Myron fell back in his chair , with his hands spread before him , " that 's my Reason Number Two . " Once more the family raised its voice . " It 's a fact , it 's a fact , " said Aunt Fanny . " Things always turn out badly in the end anyway , so what does it matter , why worry your head over them ? " And Cousin Seymour added , " There 's no doubt of it , Norman . Just the other day  --  Tuesday afternoon , to be exact  --  I happened to read the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages  --  " Way down deep , Cousin Seymour was definitely his mother 's son . " I do n't know , I do n't know , " Norman kept saying , as he shook his head . " I suppose you 're right , Uncle Myron . In a way , that is . She 's really sort of helpless and naive , is n't she ? She 's got so much faith in how clever and artistic she is  --  I doubt if it 's ever occurred to her that everybody else might not admire her as much as she admires herself . So if I told her the real reason why Leo admires her , well , it would hurt her pretty badly , would n't it ? " " Now you 're catching the idea ! " Uncle Myron cried , clapping his hands together enthusiastically . " But you could save her this misery . You could do it with no trouble at all . " " Yes , I could , could n't I ? No trouble at all . " For a second Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was looking off into space , looking into the future , the afternoons at the club , and walking into a restaurant with his wife on his arm  --  but that was only a second , and then he was back in the living room again , with the family gathered around him , watching him hard . " But I ca n't do it , Uncle Myron , " he said , staring down at the floor . " I hate to disappoint you all . And I hate to hurt that girl . But sometimes people have to get hurt . Sometimes it 's more important to be honest and tell the truth  --  and the fact is , I suppose it 's not150 T H E G O O D - F O R - N O T H I N Gjust the girl I 'm thinking of . It 's me  --  it 's my own feelings  --  I just would n't feel right , if I let her marry Leo . I suppose you could say it 's my conscience  --  " " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now he brings in his conscience ! I object , I object ! How are people supposed to carry on an intelligent discussionwhen one of the parties is so underhanded as to bring in his conscience ? " " Ruth , for God 's sake ! " Uncle Myron said , and it took him a long time to pacify her and make her stop shrieking . When he finally turned back to Noiinan , his smile was sort of thin and tired . " Norman , my boy , " he began in a low voice , " I appreciate your conscience . Is n't this one of the things I always liked and respected about you , that you got a conscience  --  which God knows is getting to be a rarer and rarer commodity in this modern world ? But a man 's conscience , it is n't alwayseverything , my boy . A man has to be practical too . It 's over ten years now , ever since your father died , that you been taking care of your good-for-nothing brother . Ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to give up to his conscience . Believe me , you saved up enough self-sacrifice in the last ten years so that you can afford to take a rest from it . You can afford to say , To hell with it all ! ' And what about this Brenda Goldhill , what did she sacrifice in the last ten years ? Nothing she sacrificed . Absolutely nothing atT H E GOOD - F O R - N O T H I N G 151all . She 's so fond of your brother Leo , is she ? So for the next ten years , let her take care of him , and do n't you give it another thought . And whether you like it or not , my boy , that 's my Reason Number Three . " After a pause , Norman spoke very softly , " Uncle Myron  --  do you really believe them , all those things you just said ? Do you honestly believe them ? " " Do I honestly believe them ? Where 's a match ? This fool cigar went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a match in his own pocket , and with a long ritual of puffingand grunting he lit his cigar . And then with a sigh , he went on , " How do I know if I believe them ? What I believe , what I do n't believe , frankly I 'm not so sure about any of it no more . Maybe I 'm not an honest man . Maybe I should be ashamed of myself . All right  --  I 'm ashamed of myself . " FIe smiled for a moment . Then after another puff at his cigar , his voice got a little firmer : " But I ca n't help myself , and that 's that . I 'm not such a youngster no more , and it 's too late for me to change myself , and that 's also that . And God damn it , Norman my boy , before I 'm dead and buried I 'm going to have the satisfaction of knowing that you 're happy ! Now you 'll be pleased to know that this is the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm shutting up . " And without another word , that 's just what he did . " Uncle Myron , " Norman said , hardly able to kee T H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N Ghis voice steady . " I did n't realize that you felt so strongly . I do n't know what to answer . I appreciate it  --  that a fine man like you has such a feeling for me . " " Then you 'll do it ? " Aunt Ruth said . " You 'll keep your mouth shut and let Leo marry that girl ? " Norman fell to shaking his head again . " I do n't know , I do n't know . Maybe there 's something in it , what you 've been saying . Maybe I 'm just being stubborn and unreasonable . Maybe I ought to listen to what somebodyelse says for once  --  " " Yes ? " said Aunt Ruth , and her " Yes " was echoed all over the room . " After all , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untidily , as they came to him , " what does she mean to me , that girl ? Compared to Uncle Myron and the rest of you  --  and Leo  --  and all the other people who are close to me ? " " Yes , yes ? " " Maybe I do n't have any right to interfere . I 'm not sure any more . I 'm all confused . Maybe I ought to think it over  --  " And he stopped short , suddenly aware of the whole bunch of them , sitting forward on the edge of their seats , watching him intently . So worried and anxiousand excited , and all for what ? For him . For his interests , for his happiness . When you got right down to it , they were a pretty wonderful family . They had their little faults , of course  --  eccentricities mostly , harmlessT H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N G 153eccentricities  --  but when you got right down to it , who else did he have in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness ? Could he really turn up his nose at all that , could he really be so stubborn and unappreciative , just because of a ridiculous whim he could n't even give a logical reason for ? But at that moment a voice broke into his thoughts . It was Leo 's voice , slow and pleasant and full of confidence . " There now , what did I tell you ? All you had to do was humor him a little . Give him a chance to show us that he can make up his own mind about things  --  let him work up a dramatic effect  --  treat him like a human being , and sure enough he comes around to your way of thinking in the end ! " In an instant it shattered , the whole structure of noble rationalizations and fine family feelings that Normanhad been slowly building up in his mind . It shatteredand was swept away , and he found himself staring at Leo in horror . " Good heavens , " he said , " I think I must 've been crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one moment even  --  tricking that poor girl into marrying you ! I wo n't allow it ! No , I wo n't ! I 'll simply never allow it ! " At this the family went into an uproar  --  and Norman was given a breathing spell , a few moments of peace to recover from his horror and his close escape . Because the family 's anger was directed entirely against Leo. 154 T H E GOO D- F O R - N O T H I N G " Leo Kramer  --  Leo Kramer , " was all Aunt Ruth could manage for a while . " Leo , you noodnick ! " said Uncle Myron . " Absolutely , the world 's champion noodnick ! " " Very unfortunate , " said Cousin Seymour . " Now perhaps , if I had been allowed to handle this discussion from the beginning  --  " Aunt Fanny moaned , and Aunt Hannah clucked her tongue in distress , and Aunt Ruth found her voice again . " Leo Kramer , what 's the matter with you ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolute mental incompetent ? " When the noise subsided a little , Leo laughed and said , " Now what 's everybody in hysterics for ? Are you still taken in by that Little Lord Fauntleroy act of his ? Believe me , he is n't going to do a thing ! " This remark turned everybody 's attention to Norman again . But he had himself in hand now , and though they shouted at him and pleaded with him , coaxed him and threatened him , for quite some time , he just kept right on shaking his head and repeating wearily , " I am going to talk to her  --  I 've made my decision  --  and I 'm definitely going to carry it out  --  " This went on until noon , when Norman rose to his feet and said , " I 'm sorry  --  I do n't want to be impolite  --  but I 'm meeting Brenda for lunch , and I really must n't be late . " The rest of the family gave up at this , and contentedTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 155themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . Her voice pursued Norman into the foyer and all the way out to the hall : " Norman Kramer , if you do this low , ungrateful thing , I 'll never trust another human being as long as I live ! " 11WHEN HE LEFT THE APARTMENT HE WASfirm . His heartbeat was fairly regular , and he was full of strength and quiet determination and all the other things that he knew a practical , self-disciplined man is supposed to be full of . But two minutes later , as he rode down in the elevator , he suddenly crumpled . His chin drooped , his shoulders sagged , and a deep sigh escaped him , like the air escaping from a balloon . All his clear purposes and noble resolutions were a great big muddlein his head ; somehow he could n't seem to sort them out from Uncle Myron 's reasons and Aunt Ruth 's shrieking and Cousin Seymour 's dry little lectureplatformcough . It was only a reaction , of course . A purely physical and completely mechanical reaction , after the strain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concernedabout  --  a plate of hot soup would drive it away156 T H E G O O D - F O R- N O T H I N Gin no time at all . And yet , as he went downtown in the subway , as he drew closer and closer to his stop and that little French place and Brenda , his condition grew worse and worse . All his regular symptoms descended on him at once  --  his sour stomach , his pounding heart , the terrible tired aching behind his eyes . And he thought in spite of himself that he would gladly do anything , anything at all in the world , rather than go to that restaurant and face that little girl . Just the same , when his stop came , he got off the subway , and except for occasional pauses to polish his glasses , he went straight to the restaurant . It was one of those dark , narrow little places where you walk down a flight of steps and sit at a table with an old wine bottle for a lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrap slung over her shoulders , an anxious , excited smile on her face . " Oh Norman , thank goodness you 're here ! " she cried , pressing his hand warmly . " I 've been so terribly worried , you sounded so urgent over the phone . I 've been waiting here and waiting here , hardly able to sit still . And I absolutely could n't concentrate on a thing , except to look at the menu . They 've got the filet of sole today , Norman  --  this place is famous the world over for their filet of sole . Oh Norman , why did you want to see me ? Has anything happened to Leo ? It is n't an accident , is it ? He is n't hurt or anything , is he ? Oh Nor-T H E G O O D- F O R- N O T H I N G 157man , " and she raised her gloved fist to her mouth , " he is n't dead ? " " No , no . Leo is alive . Very much alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , thank goodness ! Thank goodness ! " Brenda began to laugh gaily in her relief . " Honestly , Norman , you gave me a terrible fright . But I 'm all right now , please do n't look so worried about me . What was it you wanted to talk to me about ? Only first , here 's the waiter . I hope you 're hungry . Personally I 'm famished . Would you like an appetizer ? What about the eggs a la Russel " " A plate of hot soup , please , " Norman said . The waiter went away , and Brenda clasped her hands together on the table and smiled at Norman with one of her brightest , most confidential smiles . " Now then , Norman , please do n't keep me in the dark any more . " Norman wet his lips . " The fact is , Miss Goldhill  --  " " What 's that ? What 's that ? " She shook her head and sighed and smiled at him sweetly and sadly , as if he were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of his naughtiness . " Miss Goldhill indeed . Oh Norman , what is it that Leo and I keep telling you ? You simply have to get over that shyness of yours . With me of all people  --  it 's just ridiculous for you to have all those inhibitions . Has n't Leo told you what a genuine fondness I have for you , what a fine thoughtful person I think you are ? " 158 T H E G O O D - F O R- N O T H I N G " Yes . Thank you . I 'm really very grateful , " Norman said . " But you see  --  Brenda  --  this is what I wanted to discuss with you . Well , the fact is , it is Leo . Leo and you , that is . " " Leo and me ? " " Yes . Your  --  your relationship . " " Leo and me ? You wanted to talk about Leo and me ! " She clapped her hands together ecstatically . " Oh Norman , what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'd planned it that way . " " I 'm sorry  --  I 'm not sure I understand . " " Then I 'll tell you everything , Norman . Yes , I will , " and she nodded her head a few times , with great decision , " frankly and openly  --  I definitely will ! That 's the nicest thing about you anyway  --  and I want you to know , I 'm completely sincere about this  --  I 've always felt that you were somebody I could talk to with absolutelyno restraint whatsoever . I mean , I 've always felt that I could tell you the absolute truth , that I could pour my soul out to you , and you 'd be able to sympathizeand understand . " Norman began to fidget a little in his chair . " Brenda , what are you getting at ? " The waiter returned , and they were silent while he served them their food . Norman 's soup was steaming , and he started in on it greedily , even a little desperately , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at allT H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N G 159  --  but because it was going to clear his mind and give him courage . " This is what I 'm getting at , Norman , " Brenda said . " You may not be the intellectual type , you may not have any artistic ability or any interest in cultural things , but you 've got something much more important than that . You 've got a heart , a real heart . Yes , you have , none of your modesty now  --  a real human heart . And that 's why I know that I can confide in you . As if you were an older brother almost  --  or a father even . I 've never been very confidential with my father , I 'm afraid . " She sighed a little . " Poor Daddy , he means so well , but he 's never really had any education , all he knows is business , business , business . And of course , he talks with an accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're one of the few businessmen I 've ever known whose advice I can ask with perfect frankness . " " My advice ? " Norman stopped eating his soup , and looked at her suspiciously , and not without a touch of panic . " My advice about what ? " " That 's the wonderful coincidence ! " She leaned forward and smiled again . " About Leo ! I 've been thinking and thinking about doing this for ever so long . For weeks and weeks now I 've been trying to work up enough courage , I 've been looking for an opportunity  --  " " Maybe you 'd better not say it , Brenda , " Norman16o T H E G O O D- F O R- N O THIN Gbroke in hastily . " Maybe you 'd better listen to me first  --  listen to what I have to tell you . After that you may not feel that I 'm exactly the  --  the ideal person to ask for advice . " " But you are the ideal person ! Oh you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modesty of yours . Always belittling yourself , always underestimatingyour own abilities . And I do so want you to be strong and confident just now . Because you see , this morning I 'm , the one who 's weak and timid , and  --  " " Is the soup not satisfactory , sir ? " said the waiter . Norman looked down at his plate . He had only finisheda couple of spoonfuls  --  his mind was just as confusedas ever , and his courage was just as weak and halting . " It 's very good , " he said , embarrassed in front of the waiter . " I 'm just not as hungry as I thought I was . The waiter whisked away their soup plates and began to set out the main course . Brenda looked at Norman with concern , asked him if he was feeling all right , and said with a sigh , " It 's the tensions of our time  --  the constant pushing and scratching and getting ahead of the next person . The modern disease , Natalie Du Bois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone away , she lowered her voice to its confidential tone again and went on from where she had left off . " You must be strong and confident , Norman , because you see  --  T H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N G 161you 're the only person in the world who can help me . " The only person in the world ! It was terrible that she should be talking to him this way . He knew he ought to put a stop to it and get down to cases . But her eyes were so bright and eager , and her smile was so  --  well , sort of trusting , that he really could n't do a thing except nod his head and say , " Yes , of course . That 's what I want to do  --  help you . " " Oh thank you , Norman ! Oh , I knew you would , I knew you 'd say that ! I feel better already . Is n't that peculiar  --  just to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on I can come right out and say what 's on my mind . " Then she broke off and lowered her eyes , and he saw that she was blushing . " Of course , it 's probablyno secret to you anyway  --  how I feel about Leo . " " No , it is n't a secret . " " Of course it is n't , I suppose I show it every time I open my mouth . I suppose the whole world is talking about it , and laughing at me behind my back . " She smiled and really seemed quite pleased at this thought . " And I know what you must be thinking yourself  --  me being so young , and you being so  --  such a mature individual . Just a case of puppy love , you must be thinking . The silly girl will be over it in a week . " " No , I assure you . I do n't think it 's silly at all . " " It 's sweet of you to say that , Norman , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really know better . I know how162 T H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N Ghard it 's going to be to convince you that this is n't a case of puppy love . I 've gone through puppy love before  --  I could n't tell you how many times  --  and this is so terribly different , so much more beautiful and overwhelmingand  --  and everything else that a deep , sincere , permanent love can be  --  " Her voice was a little too intense , her words a little too fancy and dramatic . But Norman could n't mistake the sense of what she said . It came to him with a little pang of recognition , and in a moment he was involved in the old familiar struggle to put down and cover over a rush of feelings that he had been putting down and covering over for many years . And the way Brenda went on talking , it just made the struggle harder for him . " Leo told me once that you would n't know about such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing yourself . " " Leo told you that ? " " Oh , you must n't look so uncomfortable about it , Norman . Leo and I , we tell each other everything , there are no secrets at all between us . I hope some day you 'll be telling me everything too . And besides , I told Leo that I did n't agree with him . I think you have experienced such a thing yourself . I 'm sure there 's been some incidentin your past , and it turned out terribly sad , and you 've never really been able to forget her . I 'm right , I 'm right  --  I can see it from your face that I 'm right ! SoTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 163you must know what I 'm going through , Norman . You must know what my feelings are . " " Your feelings for Leo , " Norman said , trembling a little . " Are they really that strong , Brenda ? " " Stronger , stronger ! " Her food completely forgotten , Brenda leaned forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh Norman , if I could only begin to tell you how strong ! Now that I 've let out so much of it , I do n't mind exposing myself completely . When I wake up in the morning , the first thing I think about is him . And I 'm not really happy , my day has n't really begun , until I see him . If we have an appointment for lunch , I ca n't concentrate on a single thing until he comes for me . I do n't hear what people are saying to me . I drop things and I fumble with things . And then , when it 's time for him to arrive , I just stand at the window , staringinto the street , or I fly to the door at every little sound . And if lie 's one minute late I 'm in agony . Yes , I am "  --  she reached out and grabbed his hand and squeezed it urgently , as if she was afraid he would n't believe her  --  " real agony ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to him . I see him stretched out on the pavement all dead and mangled . But when I finally do hear his knock , and he comes into the room , and he 's smiling at me with that boyish smile of his , and he makes his first joke , oh Norman ! " And Brenda leaned back again , and laughed her gayest164 T H E G O O D- F O R- N O THIN Glaugh . " All my agony goes away in a second ! It fades away just as if it never existed , and for the rest of the day I 'm the happiest person who ever lived ! " And she came to a stop , red in the face and completely out of breath . It was a long time before Norman could trust himself to speak . " What 's the reason , Brenda ? " he said . " What is it that you find in him ? " " Norman dear , " she said , calm again . " I understand that question only too well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You want to be sure this is n't just a lot of hysterical emotionalism , you want to feel that your brother is being loved in a mature way , by a mature person who appreciates his deepest qualities  --  not just by a superficial , neurotic child . It 's perfectly natural of you , Norman , and I certainly do n't hold it against you . Far from it , far from it . Why , the relationshipbetween you and Leo was one of the very first things that attracted me to him . In this modern world , it 's wonderful , really wonderful , to find two brothers who are so devoted to each other . " " That 's one of the first things that attracted you to him ? " " It did , it did . If you do n't believe me , ask Natalie Du Bois  --  she 's this friend of mine from Savannah , Georgia . I told her all about your relationship the day after I met you . I thought she might be able to do a THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth and pleasantfor literature , there was n't enough conflict in it . So you must understand , Norman dear , that I want to give Leo that same devotion myself . I appreciate his fine qualities as much as you do  --  his sensitivity , his artistic talent , his sense of responsibility . Almost too much responsibility , it 's almost a fault instead of a virtue . And I appreciate the sad life he 's led , the way he 's been forced by circumstances  --  purely circumstances , Norman , I certainly do n't blame you or your mother for a moment  --  to submerge his true personality and grind away at work he dislikes . You do believe that , do n't you ? " " Yes , I do . " " I 'm glad . I 'm so very glad . Then the last obstacle is cleared away , and I can finally ask your advice . " " Yes , please . Ask my advice . " " You know your brother Leo better than anybody , Norman . He 's told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself with my own eyes . You must know what 's been going on inside of him these last few weeks . Even if he has n't come out with it directly , you must have guessed it , the rapport between you two must go far beyond mere words . Tell me the truth  --  please , please , be absolutelyfrank with me , do n't hide a thing from me . " She lifted her chin a little . " I 'm woman enough to bear the truth ! " Then she leaned forward again . " What does Leo feel towards me , Norman ? Does he feel just a tiny166 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGlittle bit of what I feel towards him ? Is there any chance at all for me  --  maybe not right away , but eventually ? " " You 're asking me what Leo feels toward you ? " Normansaid , more to himself than to her . " You 're the only one I can ask . And I have to know , I have to . I wo n't ever be at peace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth  --  " " Please , Norman , please . Tell me everything . " " Everything  --  " And he could n't bear to look at her a moment longer , he lowered his eyes and began eating his meat fast . After a while , Brenda spoke again . " I knew it . I knew it all the time . He does n't feel a thing towards me , does he ? I 'm just an empty-headed , amusing little girl to him . " She gave a quick , high little laugh . " Well , what am I complaining about , anyway ? What else did I expect ? I am an empty-headed little girl , there 's not much doubt about that . If I was foolish enough to deceive myself into thinking that a man like Leo could ever care for me  --  well , I 'll just have to take the consequences . Waiter , waiter ! " She started waving and snapping her fingers . " You do n't mind if we get out of here , do you ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a diet these days  --  I have to be getting back to the office anyway  --  Thank you , Norman . Thank you very much for the truth . And if I never see you again  --  " T H E G O O D - F O R - N O T H I N G 167Just another moment of hesitation , and then Norman raised his eyes , and smiled at her as steadily as he could and made his voice as convincing as he could . " What are you talking about , Brenda ? What are you looking so upset about ? You have n't even given me a chance to answer you . " Brenda stopped short as she was drawing on her gloves . " Do you mean  --  ? " " Of course Leo cares about you , Brenda . I 've discussedit with him at length . He 's never cared about any girl as much as you . And I know for a fact  --  a positive fact  --  that he 's really quite anxious to marry you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're being absolutely truthful ? " " Certainly I am . Why , he would have proposed to you a long time ago . Only he was n't sure you 'd accept him . " Norman forced out a joking little laugh . " He was too shy to take the risk . " " Oh Norman ! " Brenda 's whole manner changed in an instant . The color came to her cheeks , her eyes were bright , and her tragic air disappeared . " Oh thank you ! Thank you ! How can I ever thank you ? " " Do n't thank me . " Now that it was safe , Norman lowered his eyes again . " Nothing to thank me for . " " But there is ! There 's everything to thank you for ! Leo 's picking me up for dinner tonight  --  and now I 'll know just how to act with him ! I wo n't be timid and168 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGretiring any more ! I wo n't be afraid to let him see how I feel ! And it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , Leo and me , I promise you we wo n't . When we 're married , you 'll be like one of the family to us . We 'll devote ourselves to you , we 'll cure you of that shyness of yours , we 'll make you see for yourself what a fine , lovable person you are ! " " Thank you , Brenda . I 'll look forward to it . " He paid the check and they left the restaurant , but Brenda 's display of enthusiasm and gratitude went right on out in the street . She laughed and cried and clasped her hands together , and ran on about the future , all the way back to her office building . And there , right on the sidewalk in front of everybody , she grabbed Norman by the shoulders and kissed him on the cheek . " I 'm sorry , Norman , but I could n't resist it , I just had to do it . Good-by ! " But still he could n't get away , because she turned back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did tell me , did you , what you wanted to discuss with me ? " " Nothing at all , " Norman said . " Exactly what you just discussed with me . " " Really ? " Brenda 's eyes opened wide . " Why , it 's an even bigger coincidence than I thought . Oh I 'm sure that 's some sort of a good omen ! " Then she blew him a kiss and turned away again . " Brenda ! " Norman called after her . T H E G O O D- F O R- N O T H I N G 169She turned around and smiled at him . " Yes , Nor-man ? " " Nothing , nothing , " he said , with a shake of his head . " I only wanted to say  --  good luck to you . I know you 'll be very happy . " " Oh thank you , Norman darling . Really , you 're terriblysweet . " She was gone now , and Norman started along Fifth Avenue . He walked very slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when somebody bumped into him or pushed past him . For a long time he walked , trying to look into himself , to figure out what he was thinking , why he had done what he did , what kind of man he really was . Pretty soon his feet began to hurt , and he took the bus home . The apartment was empty . He sat down in the easy chair and braced himself for a moment , and then he went to the phone . He called up Aunt Ruth and told her the news . Her voice was loud and triumphant , and it made his ears tingle : " Norman Kramer , I apologize ! I give you my heartfelt apologies ! You acted brilliantly  --  brilliantly ! I 'm proud of you ! Any uncomplimentary words or phrases I may have used earlier today in the heat of discussion are officially withdrawn ! " Then he called up Uncle Myron . And after a long pause , Uncle Myron said , " Norman , my boy , I 'm glad you did it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T H E G O O D- F O R- N O THIN Ggoing through , but I got to be honest and truthful  --  I 'm glad you did it anyway ! " And then , about an hour later , the front door opened and Leo appeared , and Norman came to the hardest part of all . In one quick breath , he told Leo the whole story . " Well , I 'll be damned ! " Leo cried . Then he grinned and rubbed his hands together . " Nevertheless , I had faith in you all along , Normie . I knew you would n't let your kid brother down in the end . And so  --  before I hurry downtown to my ladylove and stammer out my bashful proposal , full of fear and trembling and the certaintyof being refused  --  before I play this tender scene , let me shake your hand and express my thanks . " He came up to Norman with his hand outstretched . But Norman shuddered away , and suddenly heard himselfsaying in a loud voice : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take your thanks ! Whatever I did , I did n't do it for you ! I did it for myself ! I did it for my own selfish purposes ! " Then he stumbled out of the room , and hurried into his own bedroom , and dropped onto the bed . There he sat for a while , catching his breath . And then , slowly , as his anger ebbed away , he let his head ease back on the pillow . The truth is , he was tired . He was tired and worn out , and he felt as if he had n't had any sleep for years . What a relief to lie there , just lie there , withoutTHE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 171a worry in the world , with nothing at all to do but stare up at the ceiling . A man ca n't keep on fighting forever , he told himself . It just is n't fair to expect him to. 12THAT NIGHT , BY WAY OF A CELEBRATION , Ruth and Myron went to a musical comedy , and took Hannah with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater , but Ruth was in such a good mood that she actually decided to go all the way up to Washington Heights in the Cadillac and call for Hannah at her home . " Only be sure you 're all ready , down in the lobby , " Ruth said . " It 's an eight-thirty show , and there wo n't be time to go upstairs for you , because God knows we 'd never break away once your Teitelbaum woman started chattering . " Hannah , as usual , felt a little pained , at the way Ruth talked about Miss Teitelbaum . But she did n't say anything , and she was down in the lobby on time . All during the ride downtown , Ruth talked about exactly the same thing she 'd been talking about all evening . " Well , I did it ! It took me a little while maybe . There were some close calls maybe . But frankly , I never had a moment 's doubt . I knew all along how things172 T H E GOOD - F O R- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I decide that I 'm going to do a thing , I think I can say , with all modesty , that it usually gets done . And this applies especially to matters that I consider myself something of an expert in , like bringing together two young people , even if one of them did n't quite plan on it . Am I right , Myron ? " " Who should know it better than me ? " Myron said , in a low voice . Ruth frowned . " Excuse me ? " Myron looked up at her , a little startled . " What 's the matter ? Did I say something ? " Ruth smiled again , adjusted her furs and her chin , and went on talking . " Just because I 've had a certain measure of success so far , though , do n't think I 'm foolingmyself that my job is over . Do n't think I intend to fall asleep on my laurels . No thank you , that may be how other people do things , but that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , that 's not the ending , that 's the beginning . There 's announcements to be made , parties to be given , two families to be brought together , a wedding to be arranged . Of course , I understand that under ordinary circumstances a certain amount of these duties are supposed to be handled by the bride 's family . But that 's only because , under ordinarycircumstances , there is n't generally a person in the groom 's family with so much unique experience and ability along those lines . In short , tonight I enjoy myself . T H E G O O D- F O R- N O T H I N G 173Good honest relaxation , after a job well done . And tomorrowmorning first thing  --  down to work again ! " There was no answer to this . But a small , thoughtful cloud of smoke came out of Myron . " What 's the matter with you ? " Ruth said . " You do n't look right . You look as if you just went into bankruptcy . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favorite nephew a happy man for the rest of his life . " " A happy man , " Myron said , as if he were talking to himself . " What is it , I 'd like to know ? Only tell me what it is . " " What is a happy man ? Of all the nonsensical questions ! Everybody knows what it is , to be happy . To be happy is  --  it 's a definite  --  happy is a certain  --  " She broke off with a snort and a toss of her head . " What do you mean by asking such a thing in the first place ? What 's going through your mind anyway ? Are you trying to imply  --  What are you trying to imply ? " " Nothing , nothing . Who 's implying ? " " You are , Myron Kramer ! I imagine I 've been living with you long enough to recognize an implication in your eye when I see one ! Now tell me  --  " " Here 's the theater , Ruth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should I run out to the box office and pick up the tickets ? " The conversation stopped temporarily while they174 T H E GOOD - F O R- N O T H I N Gpushed their way into the theater and down to their seats , skimmed through their programs , looked around the audience for celebrities , and worried about the lady in front of them with the big hat . But as soon as all these routine details were attended to , Ruth immediatelytook up where she had left off . " What were you trying to imply ? I hope it is n't what I think it is ! Because if it is , I do n't mind saying it 's the most insane thing I ever heard of ! It reaches heights of insanity which I did n't think that even this family was capable of ! So out with it , please . All of a sudden , at this late date , you 're beginning to have doubts , is n't that it ? You 're beginning to think I did n't do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the bushes , let 's come right out in the open  --  you 're accusing me  --  " " Ruth , Ruth , not so much noise . Nobody 's accusing nobody . If there 's any accusing to do , believe me , it 's I myself  --  " " There ! There you are ! I was right ! You just confessedit . You 've definitely got some sort of crazy idea  --  " " The lights are going out , " Hannah said . " Ruth , Myron  --  it 's beginning , the show  --  " With a couple of sniffs , Ruth settled back in her seat and stuck out her chin at the stage , as if she dared it to come up with anything that would amuse her . Myron hunched down with his chin in his hand . And Hannah , THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING 175who was sitting between them , kept looking from one to the other nervously . In this manner , they sat through the first half of the musical comedy , without tapping their feet to a single one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes . The moment the curtain fell and the lights flashed on for the intermission , Ruth leaned over Hannah and barked into Myron 's ear , " He is going to be happy ! When I make arrangements for somebody 's happiness , then they 're happy , and they stay that way , or I know the reason why ! I fail to see what earthly reason you have for supposing any different ! " " No reason , no reason ! Now for God 's sake  --  " " Intermission ! " Hannah said . " Should n't we go out for the intermission ? A breath of air  --  " They got up from their seats , glared at the other people in the row for not moving their feet out of the way , and joined the crowd that was moving up the aisle to the lobby . The crowd moved slowly , inch by inch , and every inch Ruth yelled at Myron , and Myron nodded his head and said , " Yes  --  absolutely  --  why not ? " When they finally got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over , and they started down the aisle again , Ruth yelling and Myron nodding as before . " It 's impossible to please some people ! " Ruth said . " Some people , no matter what you do , they do n't like it .

How dare he be unhappy ? Well , thank God the whole world is n't so bad-natured and unappreciative . Thank God there 's some in this family  --  Hannah , for instance  --  " " Lights going out again ! " Hannah cried . " Here comes the second act ! " The second act was even louder and peppier , and more full of folksy jokes and ballets and songs about race prejudice , than the first act . But the curtain might have stayed down the whole time for all the Kramer family absorbed . At the end of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started in again : " Thank God there 's some who do n't share your ridiculous point of view ! Hannah dear , tell Myron how you feel about this . Tell him whether you 've got any doubts about Norman 's happiness . " The last blare of the trumpets was still in Hannah 's ear , and it slowed up her reflexes a little . She made the terrible mistake of turning her eyes away and mumbling , instead of agreeing with Ruth immediately . A split second later she recovered herself , she tried to save the situation by bursting out eagerly , " Oh yes , Ruth  --  you 're right , you 're right  --  Happy ? Why , thanks , to you , he 's going to be the happiest young man alive ! " But it was too late . Ruth 's glare was already like ice , T H E G O O D- F O R- N O T H I N G 177and already she was gathering her strength for the blow . " Hannah Kramer ! " it came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or so I always supposed ! After all the things I 've done for you , how can you turn on me like this ?

All right , all right , we wo n't discuss it  --  I can stand it , I 've gone through worse in my life  --  we simply wo n't discuss it ! " " Ruth  --  Ruth dear  --  please  --  " " I 'm sorry , we wo n't discuss it  --  " " So do n't discuss it ! " Myron shouted out suddenly . " So shut up for a minute , the two of you !

When the Cadillac pulled up and the chauffeur held open the door , Ruth snapped at him for not pulling up sooner . And when they had all climbed inside and had ridden along in silence for a while , she suddenly turned to Hannah and spoke in her coolest , politest voice . " We 'll take you as far as Park Avenue , Hannah dear . You 'll just have to catch a subway or a bus or something178 THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGfrom there . I 'm afraid we ca n't ask the chauffeur to drive all the way up to Washington Heights at this time of night !

PART **27;7470;TOOLONG equanimity and fine acceptance of life as an agreeable comedy , or spectacle , more impressive . In Ashton , Wise 's great love was Emily , Nephi 's willowy sister-in-law . I could not forget , but did not mention , that three years previously , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower Yellowstone Project , Wise had gone off the deep end for Lulu Lucas , who sang and played in the only motion-picture theater within fifty miles of our camp . That Lulu had wheedled him into buying her sapphires and then gone east with another man , without notice and with the gems , had not undermined Wise 's faith in pure womanhood . He had simply made a mistake , from which he soon recovered . I had an idea of what was coming when I saw Wise and Emily being introduced . We were having music that evening at the Coleman bungalow . After a brisk preliminary , Oscar trotted out his old standbys for sentiment and tears , " The Last Rose of Summer " and " The Heart Bowed Down . " Emily kept her large dark eyes fixed on Oscar , who pretended not to see her . Oscar seemed to be in a musical trance , beyond the range where he could cross another human vision . Wise leaned back in the brand-new Morris chair and watched Emily through the smoke of a Corona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was planning to wire him that night , so that flowers for Altha and Emily would arrive by the afternoon train on the morrow . He decided to arrange with Kurt Mook for an exclusive supply of the finest candy that could be bought in St. Paul or Seattle . Wise had long transparent hands , like Sherlock Holmes ' ( and also our Spinoza 's ) , and with them he made motions almost imperceptible , like those of fronds of algae under the sea . He breathed deeply , forgetting his cigar , in the hope of entrappingin his thin nostrils a whiff of Emily 's perfume . He thought about her extra-long cotton hose , and resolved to buy silk ones for those matchless limbs . He reasoned withp101himself about Oscar , repeated silently to himself what the violinist had said that indicated he did not want female entanglements . Oscar had been in Ashton only a few days ahead of him , and surely there was no understanding , either tacit , implied or incipient , between Oscar and this ethereal girl . He wondered whether Emily had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or warm hands and cool skin all over , in the summertime . He caught the tang of salt air in the timbers of her voice . Most of all , he marveled at her immobility . She could sit still , without twitching , swaying , nodding , shifting her feet , squirming surreptitiously inside her fragrant clothes , unfolding her hands , or gulping when she swallowed . Now and then her eyelids would descend and rise again . That was all . Not even that first evening could Howard forget that before the snow fell in the mountains , he would have to leave Ashton and go into Jackson Hole . He could not let Crowe down , for the finest of women or to keep his heart intact , so he realized that he must act quickly , show Emily how deeply he loved her and earn her promise to wait for him until spring . At the same time he acknowledged that a keynote of her character seemed to be sincerity , and that if she was impulsive , her first impulse had been directed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for passing up Emily as much as he loved Emily for her own sake . Wise said to himself that he would never forget what Oscar had done for him , and would be his loyal friend until death . Wise and Emily would invite Oscar to their little bungalow , wherever it might be , and tone down their bliss mercifully , so the wandering minstrel would have fewer regrets . Wise got off his telegram for flowers that night , but he was at the small pine office promptly at eight the next morning . And nobody ever awoke and got out of bed with more painfulreluctance than Wise . In one corner Norman Torrancep102would be leaning over his drafting board , blinking his weak eyes and composing stresses and strains the way Beethoven wove a development section , mixing grace of design with sound calculation . Torrance forgot whiskey and women between eight and twelve noon , and from one until five . During the rest of the hours , of which remained sixteen a day , he doted on both , and slept whenever he could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carbons , or put a new ribbon on his L. C. Smith relic . Two Underwoods came in after about ten days . Wise took one , and Tod the other . I kept moving , as liaison man , among the Mormon commercial establishments , the Short Line depot and freight office and the warehouse . Spinoza , who was by that time a good cook , went on to Squirrel Meadows , and my confidant among the freighters , old Larry O'Brien , told me the camp was in good shape there and my friend was tending to his job and doing fine . Now that Roby was on the job , the warehouse and loading platform were functioning furiously . All kinds of goods came in , were loaded nocturnally and the wagons started eastward matutinally . I never heard Roby mention the Goddess Aurora , but he and his men , including Oscar , were touched by her rosy fingers seven days each week . Roby liked the early morning , and Oscar did not , but he was a stubborn Norwegian . He would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neither would he let it be said that he did less work than other men in the outfit . As long as he was drawing pay , Oscar wanted to earn it , as other men did . When he played his violin for money , he demanded the union scale . All up and down Main Street in Ashton , from Park Avenue , which ran catty-cornered along the east side of the railroad tracks , to the abandoned stone foundation across from Nephi 's hardware store , at the corner of 6th , men worked , and women shopped and labored . They worked fast , becausep103everyone in town was making money fast , and only a few were spending it . The plumber nearest the tracks was in demand ; at every waking hour . The ice plant was running beyond capacity . The Snake River Lumber Company had sold every board they had in stock , and all those they could hope to have for months to come . A small store , with a humble proprietor and an ailing wife , who were Christian Scientists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to sell groceries and fruit as fast as goods could be handled . Doc Shaw , at the urgent request of Doc Puckett , left himself open to a tactful approach , examined the sick woman , found that she had stomach trouble due to taut nerves caused by worry , which to women of her faith was a forbidden idulgence , pointed out that God was love , and had sent the U.S.R.S. to Ashton expressly to bring her and her husband success . She began to get stronger right away and by helping her husband in the store doubled his capacity to do business and take in coin . Mrs. Orr nourished inwardly the conviction that she had convertedDr . Shaw from earthly medicine to the divine truth , as taught by Mrs. Eddy , because the doctor had given her no medicine , but only the kind of comfort that comes directly from Above . Next door to the fruit store , on the north side of Main , between 3rd and 4th Streets , was a lodging house . It was called " Arc Light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a Gentile-owned establishment . Before the Jackson Lake dam had suddenly collapsed , the Arc Light sheltered just enough guests to keep Hank and Johnny , its two bachelor proprietors , alive . Now every room was filled with beds and the beds were filled with men and , I regret to say , quite an assortment of insects . In the Hotel Ashton , two blocks away , at 5th and Main , there were almost no lice and fewer bedbugs , and the insectsp104which formerly had lived there were exterminated , more or less , under Doc Shaw 's direction . The Arc Light management charged $1 per man per night , and the Hotel Ashton $2 to $3.50 . The owners and proprietorsof both made as much money in the summer and fall of 1910 as they had expected to gain in the next ten years , if ever . So the hosts were quite cordial to their guests , and vice versa , and all of them liked us who were connected , however remotely , with their sudden good fortune . Never having been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt like a knight dispensing largesse from an endless supply , whenever I placed an order or reserved a bed in behalf of the Government . Doc Puckett made enough from booze prescriptions to ensure himself a riotous old age , and treated hangovers , incidentalcuts and bruises and a few cases of D.T. 's , the first seen in Ashton . Doc shared a one-story building with a tailor named Ben Youstler who , in spite of a definite Semitic cast of countenance , had joined the Latter Day Saints and was one of the most faithful at attending meetings and dishing out his tithe , which with Mormons amounted to ten percent of income or earnings . Before July , 1910 , his entire monthly earnings were only one-half of the tithe he paid in July , August , September and October . Ben crooned Russian melodiesas he sat cross-legged and sewed , cut cloth with his shears or fitted jackets with his mouth full of pins . Ben told us , whimsically , that if he had known what the effect on business would be , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before , but he was only joking . Ben was not a violent man . In the bowling alley , from morning until after midnight , were heard the rumble of balls and the clatter of pins , the shouts of the successful , the exclamations of those who foozled their shots . Nephi 's superiors ( in rank oily ) at Salt Lake City found an odd corner in one of our freight cars inp105which to tuck a few cases of duck and candle pins , some new balls , score sheets and lots of keel . For those who preferred billiards there were two tables , one spottier than the other , so that a stimulating element of chance was injected into the games . In the same building was the Jack Mormon barber shop , patronized by the unsaintly and frank users of liquor , tobacco and snuff . Three chairs were manned and occupied steadily where one had been used intermittently before . The talk was not exclusively of crops or work on the new dam . As the townspeople and itinerants were being shaved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they read copies of The Idaho Statesman , two days old , and discussed the news , editorials and articles they found there . Most of the bums and nearly all the local business men were conservativein their political views , and the latter preferred the statesmanshipof their senior Senator , Weldon B. Heyburn to pronouncementsof the volatile Senator William E. Borah . Of all the picturesque reactionaries and sound scholars sent to Washington from the West of that epoch , Senator Heyburn of Idaho led the list . He was a giant in stature , with a presence as impressive as that of Oscar Wilde ( and no correspondinghabits ) . When , just after Borah 's first election , some member of the Upper House referred to the popular young attorney as " the gentleman from Idaho , " Heyburn rose to a point of personal privilege and made a provocative and eloquent objection . On another occasion , in the course of a Senate debate , Senator Heyburn said , pontifically : " I wish to remind the former speaker , through you , Mr. President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the interests of my constituents . " To Heyburn , a master of the old school , women 's suffrage was anathema , although the women of Idaho had it and most of them enjoyed it prior to 1910 . The income tax , which then had been proposed but seemed to have no chance of passage ,  |p106was  opposed , as downright confiscation by Heyburn . Borah favored both suffrage and an income tax . The afternoon train from Pocatello brought in B. F. Stoutemyer , the Idaho district 's chief accountant for the Reclamation Service , the same who had accompanied Project Engineer Weymouth and Consulting Engineer Davis on the first inspection trip after the old dam had collapsed . Wise , who was aware that Stoutemyer might have informed him in advance about his visit , as a matter of trust and courtesy , showed no resentment . The work he had done and was doing spoke for itself . It was prodigious . Wise , in fact , confronted by the foxy Stoutemyer , did not conceal his mild amusement . It was next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfimportanceor cunning with Wise . Luckily Frank Crowe chanced to be in Ashton , on one of the infrequent occasions he found it necessary to leave the preliminary work at Jackson Lake , around the dam site , for more pressing duties at the shipping point . There was a consultation , with Stoutemyer , Crowe , Wise , Norman , and , since a report or notes might have to be made , confidentially , I was asked to sit in . The Idaho State Engineer , Clem Martin , who had made such a blunder in reporting , a few days after the dam went out , that the damage was superficial , had stirred up Calvin Cobb , Editor of the Idaho Statesman , at Boise , about a Federallaw , or provision in the Reclamation Act , that plans for government work in the various states must be approved by the State Engineer in each instance . Martin had not been shown the plans for the enlargement of the Minidoka Project which , in Idaho , would utilize the water to be stored by the New Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reservoir , over the line in the State of Wyoming , been submitted to Richard Landry , the Wyoming State Engineer . Crowe was disgusted , and asked what the elaborate Boise office of the Idaho district was for , if not to take care of polit/ical red tape . Stoutemyer pointed out that Mr. Weymouth and his subordinates in Boise had not seen the plans in question . That was natural enough , since Norman Torrance and Crowe had been working on them , and still were racing with time to have them ready when construction could begin . It was agreed that sets of tentative plans would be prepared , for submission to the State engineers , as soon as possible . Stoutemyer had to be content with that , and went back to Boise the next day . Crowe washed his hands of the whole affair . He would not hold up Norman 's real work an hour for all the foolish laws and interfering politicians in the country , and once materials and men were at the dam site and the snow sealed them in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone approve or disapprove it as an accomplished fact . Very modestly and casually Wise offered to handle the political details and red tape . He proceeded , in an ingenious way , which gave me a further insight into the maze of complicationsunder which public works may be achieved under any kind of relatively " free " government . First he persuaded Nephi , after having explained as much as he could of the legal difficulties , to go to Salt Lake City . There , through the high ranking Mormons , he appealed to Senator Smoot of Utah , who had tried to cut down Reclamation funds and was fanaticallyopposed to Federal encroachment into State affairs . The presentation of the case to Senator Smoot was practical in the extreme . The Mormon communities of southeastern Idaho were benefiting handsomely because of the Jackson Lake dam construction , and so were many important Mormonbusiness concerns in Salt Lake City itself . Furthermore , if there were State interference from Wyoming , the movementalready afoot to include Jackson Hole in the YellowstonePark national reservation , for the protection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be slaughtered in the Hole , would gain impetus . The Idaho Senators , the reactionary pompous Heyburn and the flashy progressive Borah , could be counted upon to help , if Smoot took the initiative , because Idaho projects were getting a tremendous percentage of the Reclamation funds . Both Heyburn and Borah opposed any tendency on the part of the Federal Government to appropriate State lands for reservations , parks or any purpose whatsoever . Wise made a quick trip to Boise , without reference to the Boise office , and persuaded Editor Cobb of the Statesman , Governor Hawley , and an influential lawyer-politician named K. I. Perky , to use their influence with the Idaho Senators , so incongruously matched as to temperament , age and convictions . With everyone concerned , Wise made a tacit unwritten agreement or understanding that State approval of the plans for the new dam in Wyoming and irrigation works far down the Snake River in Idaho could be shelved until winter time , when disapproval would be too late to serve any practical purpose . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalize Jackson Hole , as an adjunct to Yellowstone Park . Civil engineers , with very few exceptions , are utterly unequippedby training , instinct or understanding to divert their attention from practical science to political machinations . That is why , along with inadequate salaries paid , so many of the best of them shun the public service , and think of petty political scheming , or even higher statesmanship , as a leprous infection of humanity , a plague on sound economics , and the curse of engineering outside of private enterprise and control.  |p109Much  has been recorded about what happens to towns when they are swept by fire , inundated by abnormal floods or beset by grasshoppers , weevils , lemmings , rats or beetles . I sing of Ashton , population 600 then , 2,000 now , when it suddenly was swamped with money , in cash or Government checks redeemable in gold , and no gold in the hills , as far as was known , or oil beneath the surface . Ashton was merely a temporaryshipping or transfer point , between a lake that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Snake and its branches . Nothing in the minds of its founders or its inhabitants had prepared it for a financial crisis in reverse . There was a streaming influx of strangers , some who remained strangers or were transported quickly , others who shared the town 's queer destiny . No camel trains of spices passed over that desert . It had no Marco Polo or avenging Genghis Khan . Since the days of the Indian wars it had felt no military strife , and there was little trouble even then , because the original Mormon settlers , when beset , were led back to Deseret with their scalps intact . Ashton was invaded in about its fiftieth year , and its twentieth as a part of these States , by the forces of reclamation . Instead of containing six hundred , like the Light Brigade before the charge , it was obliged to accommodate as many asp110eight hundred residents and transients , on a work day , and on its summer holiday so dear to the Mormons and their friends , about twelve hundred men , women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the day when they learned to walk , were fairly busy , one way or another . They shared the work of their parents or near relatives , attended the sturdy brick school across the railroad tracks , and when the town got prosperous , overnight , were dressed in new and often startling outfits of clothes , including hats and boots or shoes . They had two-bit pieces in their pockets  --  in boom times one seldom used coins any smaller  --  for candy and soft drinks . The girls had dolls , dolls ' furniture , houses , dishes and doll jewelry . The male kids had baseballs , bats and gloves , store slingshots , air rifles and their first dental care ( in St. Anthony where the bad boys still go ) , also horses to call their own , as well as lambs and calves . An astonishing number of Ashton folks and farmers or ranchers in that region were simultaneously able to afford phonographs , magic lanterns and pianos . Pianos came in via Pocatello by the carload . There was not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the lumber , cement and other materials , but , publicly and privately it was expansively planned , which is more fun and devoid of headaches . As July 24th approached , Kurt Mook urged his slowermovingproprietor to get in a large store of fireworks , includingfirecrackers , cannon crackers , rockets , Roman candles , pinwheels , monkey puzzles and red-and-blue fire . All through the West , in Boise , Seattle , Portland and San Francisco , where there were Chinatowns , fireworks were popular and purchasable , in variety and quantity that are only memories today . Tin horns and rattles were also shipped to Ashton , which was to be , for a few merry days , a hell for skittish colts and horses . I did not see more than three motor vehicles all the time I was in Ashton , although the funds acquired thatp111summer bought many automobiles and a few trucks for deliveryin the following spring . At that time , automobiles were not allowed to enter Yellowstone Park and could not , for physical reasons , get nearer Jackson Hole than Squirrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year , and the ranchers and dry farmers within a radius of fifty miles or more took Saturday off , and figured on losing most of Monday . So by Saturday noon rigs began to converge on the town from all directions , and family camps were established just off the town limits , a few with tents , but most of the campers were content with tarpaulins , rolls of blankets and an impromptu fireplace . The weather was fine , hot and sunny by day , cool and clear by night . No storm signs or omens could be found by the most pessimistic of the old timers . It must be understood in considering Ashton 's town limits that they embraced a flat area containing not more than one square mile . The settled portion of this was less than half , so the campers had a wide range from which to pick and choose their resting place for two nights . Most of them were pious , so they avoided by tacit agreement the vicinity of Madam Lake 's hook shop , northwest of town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedbugs , so they gave a wide berth to the Arc Light and , with less reason , to the Hotel Ashton . For such as did not have camping outfits , or preferred to sleep indoors , the local branch of the Idaho Furniture Company turned over its keys and premises to the town marshal , so that women and children could use the unsold beds on display  --  with the window curtains down or covered with emergency drapes , of course . From July 23rd to 25th , inclusive , it was generally understood that the terms Mormon , Jack Mormon or Gentile would be set aside and that all factions would be friendly and gay . A few of the foresighted Gentiles made provision for an adequate liquor supply , because Mormons are taught not top112drink and not many of the middle-class ones acquire the habit . The farmers around Ashton consumed a quantity of pop that made the bottle-disposal problem acute , and the poorest and raggedest of the bums , undernourished and with lowered resistance , got plastered before noon each day of the fete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon and evening . Ashton had no paved streets then , and the board or concretesidewalks were uneven and narrow . The streets , however , were eighty feet wide and probably , by now , have some trees alongside . There was no enclosed dance floor large enough to accommodate any number of the guests , so it was agreed that the long paved platforms on either side of the Short Line tracks were to be used for the purpose and that public out-of-door dances would be held Saturday evening and Sunday evening . That meant hours of performance by Oscar and me , and a couple of the trusty boys from the Reform School who played drums and cornet with an abandonconsistent with their rebellious natures and anti-social predilections . The students of American folk music , who like to analyze the styles of various bands , would have had some trouble fixing or defining ours . Oscar , the leader , played according to Hoyle and the teachers in the Salt Lake Conservatory . I injected quite a bit , I hope , of the Louisville jazz influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely have forgiven me . The juvenile delinquent on the drums imagined , as he played , that his sticks were of mahogany , like a cop 's billy , and that the skin he was beating was that of one or more of the guards at St. Anthony . The lad on the cornet stood close to me , and got in some mean tripletonguing . That he did not rapidly become dehydrated spoke well for the stamina of the younger members of our criminal population . The whole gang of boys who had been released for the occasion , because of their temporary lapse from badp113behavior , was in the " custody " of Doc Shaw , who promised to return them , one and all , to the reform school by noon on Monday . The Mormon country girls of that period danced like fallenangels and stored up enough enjoyment in the holidays to last them through months of hard work , indoors or out . The wives were diffident , but energetic . And concerning the missionaries and elders : the older ones wore beards in divers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditionof the great Brigham himself . The Mormon barber on Main , between 5th and 6th , had trimmed a few stray ones in the style of Van Dyke or Prince Albert . Before the dawn paled the bright morning star , the camperswent back to their camps , the residents to their homes , and the women and children took advantage of the offer of the Idaho Furniture Company and got in a few hours of sound sleep . It was a tossup whether the young ones or the older ones had the better time . They all wished , wistfully , that Brigham Young were still alive , but he had promised them , in one of his best sermons , that he would go ahead to prepare places for them . He told them that from this earth their souls would ascend to another planet , with several brighter suns , that they would progress , according to merit , from one planet to another , and that on the fourth one he would wait for them , take over their leadership again , and tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that season of the year in Southeastern Idaho were long and lingering , so that after work and supper , the members of the baseball team had time for snappy practice . The local fans who did not play would gather in the grandstand or along the baselines , and the Madam and her girls would watch , discreetly , from deep centerfield , so that when one of us connected at the plate or made a brilliant play in the field , we could feel two waves of approbation , one from the sheep the fielders faced , and the goats who faced the bat/ter , the catcher and the plate umpire , usually Doc Puckett , who had a good eye and fair intentions . At an early hour that Sabbath morning , the special train bearing the Boston Bloomer Girls and their small male retinueappeared at the southern rim of the flat and steamed into Ashton . Because the visiting athletes were still sleeping in the first flush of dawn , the train , with drawn curtains , was shunted onto our Reclamation side track , beyond Roby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6 A.M. in those parts , that the official committee of welcome , consisting of Doc Puckett , the town marshal , Doc Shaw , Tod the typist , our captain , Howard Wise , Norman Torrance , and me , strolled down the track to greet the Bloomer Girls . There were ten girls in all , seven of whom were first-string players , and the remaining three were utility women . They had a male manager , who looked like a Broadway promoter , a male pitcher who could throw overhand , underhand or in side-arm style and could have played in a minor league if the minors had women so handy , and a male shortstop who had been expelled from some of the leading Eastern institutions of learning and also was a sprinter . I remember most clearly Big Liz , a rangy girl who hit like a female Hans Wagner and covered first base like a veteran ; " Little Eva , " a blonde who took care of the keystone sack ; Cleo , the catcher , who had an astonishing arm ; Lulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmates of The Lake ; and Coney Island Mary , the third baseman . The Bloomer Girls ' manager made it a practice , when playing small towns , to stage a preliminary foot race , over a distance of one hundred yards , between the male shortstop , Monty , and a candidate to be selected by the town for a side bet of one hundred dollars . In Ashton , under the circumstances , suggesting a wager of one hundred dollars was like asking someone for a match . The welcoming committee assured Nat Foley , the manager , and Monty , the ' fugitivep115from higher education , that a thousand-dollar bet would please the home folks better . That set them both back a little , but they were sports and thought that we could find some middle ground , between the two extremes . Nat , who wore sparklers on his fingers and tie , asked who would run for Ashton . Those present from the town , and our group of Reclamation workers , looked questioningly at Tod and me . We both had shown speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most conservative and reliable , could not decide between us . It was decided that , before breakfast , the distance should be measured off , along the smoothest part of Main Street , that Tod and I should put on spiked running shoes , and race for the honor of meeting the professional . We got off to a fair start , not ahead or behind the gun , and both wearing long trousers , flannel shirts and , except for our shoes , our ordinary clothes . We came to a photo finish , withoutthe camera , and both Scotty and Doc Puckett , with stop watches , clocked the time well under twelve seconds . It was nearer eleven than twelve , as a matter of fact , but both of them were anxious not to cause our town to expect too much . The deterrent effect did not operate on our backers , but from some vantage point both Nat and Monty , the male shortstop and foot racer , had clocked our time , and just after breakfast , Monty developed a slight charley horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprint impractical . Nat , by that time , had smelled something unusual about Ashton , as compared with most of the stops in the sticks they they had made . " What 's going on around here ? Has someone got a private mint ? " he asked , later . " I never seen so many hicks with so much dough . " Little wonder that he was bewildered , because Ashton presented , even to the mind of an experienced and spry traveler like the Bloomer Girls ' manager , many contradictory aspects . Some of the pioneers ' whiskers were trimmed , and othersp116were not . Kids spent quarters like pennies . But the array of buildings along Main Street was crying out for coats of paint ; the center of town was in a continual swirl of dust , stirred to molecular activity in the morning sunlight whenever a rig drove in or out . There were hoboes squatting and shuffling wherever one looked , except around the two busy churches , the Mormon and the Methodist . Nat was like the burglar who was casing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window two people playing on the same piano , and concludedthe occupants could not , therefore , be rich . Reinforced by the boys from the reform school , who replacedour scholarly third baseman and two of the outfielderswho hit .250 and only home runs , we gave , thanks to the Bloomer Girls , a good show to the Mormons , Jack Mormons and Gentiles that day . Doc Shaw , always alert for more information about his fellow creatures , enumerated carefully the reactions of the bums . Those who shuffled across the railroad track , to see the game free of charge and offered to spit in the hat when it was passed , for the benefit of delinquents and orphans , our new doctor decided were reclaimable . He pointed out to the horrified Frank Crowe that since the Governmentwas spending so much to water the dry land , a little more to save its resentful wandering citizens might well be appropriated . " What are you ? A God-damn anarchist ? " Crowe asked . As inning followed inning , and the crowd got more excited because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chances to get better acquainted with my new young pal from St. Anthony Reform School , who was holding down third base . It seemed as if all the Bloomer Girls and their male help were pulling the ball over toward left that day . There must have been something in the clear Ashton light and hot but bracing air , or the great open spaces beyond the old whore house , that slanted the girl athletes ' efforts that way , and if Clint Dooby was not making a put-out or an assist , the chance '  |p117came  to me , at shortstop , or our Mormon slugger in left field . Of course , Tod , the second baseman and the morally delinquentcenter fielder , who otherwise was pretty good , caught on to the holiday tendency to hit in a northwesterly direction and shifted their positions somewhat in order to help . McElroy , our Rhode Island pitcher , was not making any strikeoutsbut he held the Bloomer Girls to ten safe hits , while we were making twelve . Clint got rid of his initial dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff , " and told me , with a philosophic grin , how he got into reform school . He had lived in what he called a " jerk town " in the Salmon River basin , with his father , and had not been able to get along very well with " the old man " because the latter was poor but honest . Clint really liked his old man . I could gather that much . But he thought the development of such a righteous reputation was ostentatious and embarrassing . His old man and Clint got a job with a man and wife who had a ranch too big for them to handle , and when a county road was built near by , Clint got to talking with a few convictswho had been farmed out from the Boise Penitentiary . Clint loved to talk about baseball , having learned to read exclusively for the purpose of perusing old sports pages . The convicts told him that the Idaho " pen " was pretty soft , and that the warden had let them form a baseball team that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clint , then seventeen , had been big for his age , and thought he could pass for twenty-one . So , having thought out his plan , Clint stole a twenty-dollar gold piece from the rancher 's dining table , beat it to the nearest town , called Warren , and loafed in a conspicuous way around the poolroom , waiting to get pinched . From what the convicts had told him , he would not have to work very hard in the Pen and would be given a fair tryout for the baseball team . Clint had neverp118been in any place large enough to have a team , and had only played scrub . We had to go to bat at this point . Clint got a scratch hit , Scotty McVeigh flied to right field , near the foul line , and although the Bloomer Girl caught the fly she could not make the throw in time , and Clint tagged up and made second . I was up , with one out . I slammed a fast one straight at the male pitcher , the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to third . The Mormons , Jack Mormons and Gentiles , including the women and children , the bums and the hookers in deep center , went wild . Up came Joe Markham , of Providence , and with the score at 4 to 4 , the thing to do was play for one big run . So Joe signaled that he would try the squeeze . He laid a fair bunt down the first base line and as he passed Big Liz she tagged him , none too gently . Joe was squarely in her way and she could not throw home in time , her comment , clearly heard on the first-base side , reflected no credit on Joe 's mother . I went on to third , and because I had missed out on the canceled footrace , took a lead and tried to steal home . The play was close . I slid in , head first , and , perhaps , on Brigham Young 's fourth star the truth will be known and it will be clear whether Doc Puckett was being just or chivalrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clint 's story , which had to be postponed until our side came in again and the other end of the batting order was up : Clint , because of his father 's fine reputation for veracity , was not arrested . The Warren marshal merely held him until the rancher and the sad Mr. Dooby came to get him and take him back to the ranch . Clint 's old man did not have to pay back the twenty , because Clint had hung onto it , to use as evidence against himself . But Clint had learned his lesson and realized that more drastic criminal action was necessary , if his ambition was to be fulfilled . That time , by night , thep119led the stock quietly out of a new two-thousand-dollar barn that was insured , poured some kerosene on the floor , and touched a match to it . The barn burned to the ground , and Clint promptly confessed . But he was sent to Boise , where he came before the famous Judge Browning , of the golden heart . The wife of the rancher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea for Clint because he was a minor , although he had insisted he was over twenty-one . Instead of getting into the Pen , Clint found himself in the enclosure of the reform school in St. Anthony . Deliberate arson was too grave , according to the books , to be overlooked and the sentence was from two years to ten . As we played , side by side on that infield , Clint and I were practically the same age , nineteen going on twenty , and we both were on a baseball team , having arrived by widely divergent routes . The baseball in Fremont County was not up to the standard of the brand in the Pen but Clint had been comforted by the St. Anthony warden , who told him , either truthfully or through kindness , that several minor-league players had been sent to the Pen about that time and that Clint might not have made the big team on the outskirts of Boise.  |p120When  a baseball game comes into the lives of 1,500 country people , any number of things happen that do not appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers . Our contestwith the Bloomer Girls made The Idaho Statesman and The Deseret News , was featured in the Short Line Express , and got a few sticks in scattered local papers throughout Southern Idaho . An incidental story aroused much more comment . The St. Anthony Reform School was then under fire because of alleged brutality on the part of a guard who had beaten a young orphan and had left the homeless boy in such condition that the warm-hearted people of Idaho started yellingand talking of a lynching . There was a legislative investigation , and the Governor read the riot act to all concerned . The instrument of punishment had been fashioned from a thick harness strap . When girls did wrong in the St. Anthony institution , a female attendant took them into the school laundry , pinned up their outer clothes , persuaded them to lean over the edge of the wash tub , with their hands inside , and whaled them with a paddle which had been made in the carpenter shop . Some of the delinquent girls disliked this process more than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come in and assist the female attendant by holding the victim , pickaback , while the paddling proceeded behind him.  |p121There  had been much dissatisfaction among the girls in the reform school because none of them had been paroled to Doc Shaw , yet many of the boys were thus favored . Some of the more spirited girl inmates at St. Anthony had expressed their protest Saturday evening at supper time by throwing their food , tin plates and all , at the female attendants when they entered the dining room . Two of the ringleaders were a shoplifter from Nampa named Dot Rusby and a sister of the chicken-hawk torturer then employed at our Cascade road house . The sister was the better built of the vigorous pair and Dot was better looking in the face . About the fourth or fifth inning I noticed a woman about thirty or thirty-five , well dressed in tailored clothes , well shod and gloved , and with the single outstanding peculiarity that in those days of large Dolly Varden hats she wore a small jaunty absurd little number , perched at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meandering up and down in front of the section of the third-base-line crowd made up of the older girls from the Ashton school , who sat on soap boxes and empty horseshoe kegs in a group . From time to time this woman , who had caught the ribald attention of the Bloomer Girls and the ladies of joy beyond center field , as well as that of Doc Shaw , Norman Torrance and several of the nonathleticReclamation men , strolled all around the edge of the field and the grandstand , glancing inoffensively and rather shyly , but politely , at the women in the crowd . That she was looking for someone appeared fairly evident , and also that her search was proving unsuccessful . Before our half of the sixth was over , I saw , too , that the Ashton town marshal and two types who looked like plainclothesmen were looking and walking nervously to and fro . The word got round that two girls who had been chastised in the reform school the night before had escaped from the St. Anthony enclosure , could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen along the Ashton or anyp122other nearby road or near the river banks . At once I thought of Oscar and wondered if he could be implicated , but he had been with me most of the night before and surely had not had time to make a trip , unobserved , to St. Anthony . When I told Oscar of my unfounded suspicions he smiled and thanked me , wistfully , for the compliment . According to Clint , who knew both girls rather well and favorably , one of them , Roberta Arney , could wear men 's clothes and probably get by . Clint outlined many convincing reasons why Dot Rusby could not disguise her sex and intimatedthat it would be a pity if she tried it . Finally the marshal and the plain-clothes men braced the strange woman with the little trick hat . I was near enough to hear her assure them , in a cultured well-modulated voice , that although she had been hanging around St. Anthony lately , from choice , as a citizen and voter could , she knew nothing of the whereabouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that if she did possess the information , she would not have given it to any cop who wore pants . She did not like policemen , in or out of uniform , she said . Fred McMinniman , who had come to Ashton for what he called " the jamboree , " told us that the woman with the hat was a character well known throughout the State . According to Fred , Miss Hat had been picked up by the authorities in Boise because , wearing the same pert headpiece , she had been frequenting the outskirts of St. Margaret 's Academy for girls . Miss Hat had a wealthy , respectable father somewhere in Northern Idaho , but she did not like him . She had money of her own , no known profession , and in spite of police vigilancein Boise and elsewhere , she had never been known to accost a man or accept attendance from males who were unlawfulor indiscreet . I felt sure , and so did my friends , including Clint and the other state boys , that Roberta and Dot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashton , and that we would locate them and do our best to help them . As I walked in toward our theoretical dugout for our half of the seventh , I saw that Doc Shaw and Miss Hat were seated on the grass . Doc was chatting , Miss Hat was listening and replying , her legs spread out in a " V , " her body from the waist up rather taut because she was bracing its weight with her arms and hands , like flying buttresses . Miss Hat was a smoothly built woman and looked athletic standing in repose . When she sat , or squatted , moved or even talked , her angles came into prominence and her gestures were expressive , not so much of dainty femininity as of frank camaraderie . As surely as she had disliked her brush with the plain-clothes men , flanked by the embarrassed town marshal , Miss Hat liked talking with Dr. Shaw . And the doctor 's merry blue eyes twinkled and his forehead lifted in a quizzical reverse frown when he caught on that the schoolgirls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post of the first-base coach who wanted to slip over behind the grandstand for a swig of drug-store port , which Kurt had dispensed on Doc Puckett 's prescription in order to conserve the whiskey supply for our immediate circleof friends . The Bloomer Girls , in their dugout , had pale beer in pitchers with property lemons in it that did not spoil the flavor . Nat , himself a married man , was firm about his athletes keeping up appearances and not getting wild reputationsas they went from town to town . Big Liz , the first-base woman , began the conversation . " Pipe the dilly with the juvenile lead , " she said , with a nod across the diamond toward the third-base line . " Where did she get that hat ? " " She 's a good scout , " I said . " Just a little eccentric . " " Sure . I 'm broadminded , " Liz agreed . " But what about the doe ? " Jim McElroy , our pitcher , went out on a called third strike ,  |p124just  then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batting list . " A good lead-off man , " Liz said . " What 's he doing out here ? " " Tod lives here , " I said . " Someone has to , " said Liz . Tod hit a slow grounder toward third and Liz moved over to the bag and prepared for the worst . The worst did not come , but the next to the worst . Coney Island Mary scooped up the roller and threw the ball across , not slow , but not fast , either . Liz stretched , grunted , made a clever pick-up but , just before she caught the ball , she heard Tod 's foot hit the sack . She turned sardonically to Tod as he trotted back to the base . Mike wound up , and threw a fast one that dusted the uniform of our Mormon left fielder who had been encouraged all afternoon by the plaudits of the hookers behind him . Doc Puckett motioned him down , and Liz swore under her breath . But across the diamond , Miss Hat had risen and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Miss Hat shouted to Doc Puckett . " Hell . You could n't kill that Hiram anyway , " said Liz , but she grinned and added , in an undertone to me : " The dilly 's rooting for us . How come ? " " She 's loyal to her sex , " I said . Liz glanced at me shrewdly , to figure out how much or how little I meant to convey . The first-base coach returned and I started toward the plate . Clint was up , Scotty on deck , and I was in the hole . We had two men on base and none out . The score was five to four , in our favor . Liz came in close , and so did Coney Island Mary . The speedy shortstop moved in , too . " Wait him out , " I whispered . The catcher heard me , saw Clint nod , and must have given a signal . The male pitcher fell for it , and threw a curve that would have cut the plate if Clint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tallp125over Coney Island Mary 's head . Tod scored , the Mormon slid clumsily into second base , upsetting the Bloomer girl down there . A couple of seconds later the husky Latter Day Saint was out . The hidden ball trick , with nobody fooled but the Mormon . He slid back , pell-mell , and knocked over Little Eva again . Mike fanned Scotty , and sent over a fast one that I underhit . It went straight up in the air , and the girl catcher , after swaying , misjudging , recovering , and lunging , held it . The third out . There was no more scoring that day . Before the Bloomer Girls went back to their special car , to wash up and change , Big Liz asked Scotty and me to come over , later , and join them in a few dozen bottles of beer . " It 's cold , and there 's nothing to pay , " said Liz . She was watching Doc Shaw and the " dilly " with the hat who were cutting across toward the tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , had herded her girls inside the slab fence , to prepare for likely contingencies . Wise was escorting Altha and Emily back to their bungalow . Oscar was waiting for them to get far enough away so that he could brace Little Eva without hurting Emily 's feelings . As the crowd dispersed , for supper and another dance that evening , the reform-school boys , headed by Clint , went over to the poolroom and bowlingalley , having given their word to Doc Shaw that they would not go near The Lake . When Doc and the " dilly " got as far as our loading platform , Doc raised his Stetson and turned Miss Hat over to Big Liz , who linked her arm with Miss Hat 's and led her into the special car . It was there , I learned later , that they found the two girls who were missing from St. Anthony . Clint had been right . Roberta was wearing men 's clothes , and Dot was in a fashionable new outfit , with an auto veil that draped her head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sympathetic lot , kept the fugitives hidden until after dark.  |p126Big  Liz and Miss Hat had agreed not to tell Doc Shaw about the situation , since Doc was on his honor , in a way , with the reform-school authorities . Instead , they confided in Scotty , Oscar and me . We had a consultation . The Wyoming line , beyond which the stray girls would be relatively secure , ran between our Squirrel Meadows road house and Cascade Creek . Scotty was due for a trip to the dam site , to do some preliminary surveying , and was willing to make the necessary arrangements with Spinoza , at Squirrel Meadows , for extra saddle horses and food that could be strapped behind the saddles in blanket rolls . Miss Hat , who was going along with Roberta and Dot , had plenty of money and agreed to finance the pair as long as they wished , in Wyomingor beyond . Having been held and tested for insanity in Boise , the woman from up north had a score to settle with Idaho , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , for her age , had a deep understanding of the facts of life . So Scotty , in the interests of chivalry , passed up the Sundaynightdance , got Miss Hat and the two fugitives to Squirrel Meadows and thence across the state line . As for me , when Monday came and the ranchers left Ashton , spreading out in all directions through the Teton Basin and Fremont County , the mail for the Reclamation office , now so voluminous each day that it was dumped into a separatesack and redistributed by Wise and Tod , contained my first letter from Elizabeth Wong . My breath quickened , and the blood was pounding in my ears , as I took the scented envelope and carried it , unopened , to the bungalow . " Dear Elliot , " the letter began . " It was nice of you to write to me , and please thank Wilfred for delivering my message . " Those who believe in Sun Wen 's teachings know that our people are not of a separate world , and that others , of differentlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , can be friendly with them . I , who am American by training ' andp127played with little Americans when I was small and went to school with them , know that most of them are not foreign devils . ' How can I explain  --  although explaining is not difficultin your case  --  that the Chinese are not all alike , that there are saints and scoundrels among them , that there are those who for selfish reasons do not like talk of liberty , and others who die for it , some slowly , alas , and more will die , but some of us will live . " I am not living in the Chinese colony here in Boise , not because I am ashamed , for I am ashamed of only part of it , less than half . A good friend ( who knows Sun Wen ) told me that the Basques are very friendly here and sent me to Helen Echegaray , the sister of the Basque man who owns this hotel where I live just now . Because of how she received me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . It seems that in Spain , where they came from , there are prospects , too , and perhaps better than ours , since the Chinese are so many and the Spanish so few . Anyway , we are allied , and I wish you knew her , too , because , if I am not too forward , I feel you are my friend , not only of ideas I have gained , but of me , in an intimate personal way . My body agrees with my mind . I am not bold but frank . I am not afraid or ashamed of feelings beyond my experience , which is uncommenced . " Next time , if you reply , as a sign that you are glad , I will write of my work here , and I would like to know about yours . So many American men , young or old , have a program of some sort , to make money , to get married , to become saved in church and do right , or to win fame . From what you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had chosen a program yet , and I can well understand , since your country is quite free , the most free of any , except possibly France and England , Sun Wen says . Oh , yes . And Switzerland . There are many countries Sun Wen has not yet visited , and I have not visited any , only several states . I am ignorant but sure of what I believe thus far . There is no need among Chinese for muchp128more belief until money is collected and something convincingis done . " Good-bye , for now , friend Elliot , " Elizabeth . " And beside her name she had brushed the characters in Chinese that also represented it . P129There was a great to-do in town just then about the escape of the two girls from St. Anthony , which affected various elementsof the Ashton population in contrasting ways . Most of the kind-hearted townspeople were indignant because of the reports of beatings and unusual punishments that had leaked out from the Reform School . In Boise , according to the Statesman , official circles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , there were those in city and country places who believed that to spare the rod , harness strap with buckle attached , would furtherspoil a bunch of girls and boys who already had proved themselves recalcitrant . Among the livelier Gentiles and Jack Mormons , there was a glint of glee in their eyes when they pictured Roberta and Dot the Dip leaning over the edge of the bathtub while some husky Jane was walloping their exposed buttocks with the official implement approved by the Director and fashioned in the manual-training department . The St. Anthony plain-clothes men finally were obliged to go back to the county seat empty-handed , and without a clue or even a theory . Nobody had told them that Roberta and Dot had been seen in Ashton . But the woman with the hat , known all over the countryside then as " The Dilly , " because she had been so designated by Big Liz of the Bloomer Girls , had also vanished . The Ashton town marshal , who liked top130confine himself to town affairs and leave county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , nevertheless was a conscientious man and one who tried to look ahead . The marshal knew that if , later , it came out in the papers and in court that two lovely fugitives , with an unusual wealth of identifying marks on their persons , had hidden out in his town and got clean away , he would be followed up and down the principal streets for months to come by irreverent glances and provocative remarks from the Gentiles and Jack Mormons , and he might lose standing in the Church of the Latter Day Saints . " Boys , " he said to Wise , Mook , Torrance , Oscar and me , " them chippies was here , and you must have had a hand in their getaway . Nothing like that happens in this little old town since Reclamation struck here without your dipping an oar in , somehow or other . That Dilly is a suspicious charac-ter . " " She was cleared by a Boise court , " I said . " If she 's not off her rocker , then I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of successful contradiction . " She 's got a right to travel , nuts or not , " said Oscar . The marshal looked hurt . " She left her trunk and all her duds in the Idaho Hotel in St. Anthony , " he said . We all became wary , at once . " Sure . She did n't want ' em any longer , " Oscar said . " There 's no law says a man ca n't leave stuff behind when he blows . " " She took all her dough , " said the marshal . Norman grinned . " In the good old First National Bank , " he said . " The First National " in those days referred poetically to a woman 's long stocking , well protected by petticoats and long skirt . " If I find out you boys helped her , I ca n't overlook it , " said the marshal . Actually no one suspected the absent Scotty McVeigh , so slow-moving , systematic and outwardly hard-working andp131respectable . Everyone had known he was due for a stay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dance to get started was accepted as a tribute to his Scottish conscience . But the moment the marshal left us , we went into a huddle as to how we should get the Dilly 's trunk and clothes for her , without gettingourselves implicated with the St. Anthony authorities . I had heard there was a messenger service in St. Anthony , so I found a plausible reason for taking the next train to St. Anthony . The Director of the school gave me permission to talk with my teammate , Clint , who was back at his " classes " in the carpenter shop . He gave me the name of a messenger boy who smuggled cigars , tobacco , snuff and tabooed refreshmentsinto the enclosure , free of charge , for the inmates he liked , and exacted only a reasonable fee from the others who could afford to pay . The messenger boy warmed up to me when I gave Clint 's name as a reference . Not many hours after I got back to Ashton the Dilly 's trunk and other effects had been removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep man 's rig , well camouflaged with wool . They were stored , temporarily , in a small back room partitioned off in the movie tent , into which Oscar was moving . Another flurry stirred officialdom and furnished fresh topics for the gossips in both towns . It became generally known that the Dilly 's stuff had been spirited , illegally , from the hotel in St. Anthony , where it was being watched , as bait , by the St. Anthony plain-clothes men , who lost no end of face . Where the Dilly and her clothes had gone was discussed but not disclosed . The Dilly 's harassed rich father in Warren was questioned , and declared that he had not seen his wayward daughter or heard from her , and he intimated that her continuedabsence and non-communicative tendencies were entirely to his liking . Meanwhile , our work was progressing steadily . Roby hired men and transferred freight in a masterly way . The road crew numbered twenty , the telephone gang , six . The Dixie D saw/mill kept a dozen men busy on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teams and rigs in the countryside were hauling loads from Ashton to Moran . One hundred carpenters , hard-rock men , riggers , muckers and skinners worked two shifts daily at the dam site over the mountains . Many evenings , when we could knock off work in time , we spent at Nephi 's : Doc Shaw , Wise and Oscar , Altha and Emily , and I. We always had music . Doc Shaw sang Schubert songs ; those of Schumann , Hugo Wolf and Brahms were his and our favorites . Oscar played classics , standard music and sentimental melodies . I did my best as accompanist . It was not too obvious , but unmistakable , that Emily , who reacted to music vibrantly , almost in a trance , getting all the thrills her strict kind of life and oversensitive conscience denied her in other respects , was the center of male attraction . The exception was Doc Shaw , who treated Altha and Emily exactly alike . He was complimentary , deferent , bold , charming , but seemed to have no preference or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebate . An Indian girl named Cora , at Madam Lake 's , was his pet , and would have followed him , or done anything for him , without thought of whether she lived , starved or died . He was not much involved , emotionally , but was appreciative and kind . Outside of Cora 's room in the hook shop , Doc was uniformly gallant and invariably attractive . But in the Coleman bungalow , even Nephi , the devoted husband of Altha , who understood as little of involved personalrelationships as he did of ancient Greek , unconsciously kept near Emily , watched her , and would have felt an emptiness in the house without her . Oscar , always mischievous , knew Emily had never lost her first affinity to him , she thinkingit was his music , so he played on her through his violin . Wise , head over heels in love , interpreted every act or word Emily performed or uttered as a response to his infatuation . Emily , herself , confused and bewildered , felt more keenlyp133alive , and distrusted her impulses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for the music and company now and then , chattered amiably , mostly about his wife , Dawn , and was oblivious to subtle details . He realized , however , that Emily could have been undone by Oscar , and was not likely to go the distance with Wise , no matter how much candy , or how many presents or flowers our chief accountantlavished on the Mormon girl , whose longest step from orthodoxy had been to discard the prescribed **30;7499;TOOLONG underwear , with fastenings and buttonsto baffle the most ingeniously wicked male . To our intense delight , it was decided early in August that I should go into The Hole about September first . We fixed it with Roby to transfer Oscar at about the same time . Wise and Norman would follow early in October , if the snow held off the upper sections of the road that long . So we all began to think of things or articles we might need in the long snowboundwinter . Scotty McVeigh already had hired three of Sheffield 's de-luxe log cabins at the dude ranch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction camp which consisted of three bunkhouses , an office with engineers ' bedrooms attached , the mess house with its engineers ' alcove , the sawmill , the tiny hospital with quarters for Doc Shaw and a small mouse-like German woman , the trained nurse . She was named Johanna Waldron . Beyond the hospital was the warehouse , a machine shop , blacksmith 's shop , and well away from all other buildings , high on the side of one of the restrained Grosventre Mountains , which faced the rugged Tetons across the lake 's surface , a dugout in which dynamite and black powder were stored . Crowe could not give anyone permission to send in by wagon freight any personal stuff beyond the barest necessities . He was reasonable , though , and did not examine too rigorouslyany of the cases , barrels and boxes which arrived at Moran , to be unloaded and stored in our log cabins . Gratefulp134for his civilized attitude , we did not go too far . We sent in twelve cases of Blackstone whiskey , six barrels of bottled beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the finest cigars , and two huge packing cases filled with printed music . At Oscar 's suggestion , I had gone through the Lyon and Healy catalogue and ordered a library of piano classics . Oscar attended to the small orchestral arrangements and the music for violin and piano . Spinoza , on his own , sent word to some Indians who journeyed to Squirrel Meadows , camped in the vicinity a while , and sold to Spinoza , for himself and for us , some wonderful blankets , rugs and baskets . Our most precious freight was entrusted , whenever possible , to Larry O'Brien , his fortunate horses and his Studebakerwagon . We had with Larry a tacit understanding that one fine Irishman would not go dry that winter , nor want for evening conversation . When Larry told me that he had been informed , through Scotty , who was beyond the mountains , that the Dilly and her protegees were safely established in Wyoming and that Miss Hat would like to have her trunk and clothes sent in , I strolled over to the movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card game in the warehouse . Oscar had received by express  --  parcel post had not then become an institution and was being fought bitterly by local merchants everywhere  --  an album published by Schirmer and entitled " Motion Picture Moods . " I had had to memorize most of the 674 pages of incidental music so that the shows in Ashton would not suffer by my ineptitude for sight reading . The piano part , also the parts for the violin and other instruments , had the following list for instant reference printed in columns at the left and right of each page : Aeroplane Page 2 Chase Page 599Band 5 Chatter 28Battle 10 Children 31Birds 21 Chimes 259p135Dances Page 39 Lullabies Page 231Doll 129 Misterioso 242Festival 140 Monotony 250Fire-fighting 151 Music-box 254Funeral 16o National 261Gavottes 39 Neutral 467Grotesque 165 Orgies 487Gruesome 169 Oriental 496Happiness 202 Parties 523Horror 173 Passion 571Humorous 174 Pastorale 564Marches 102 Pulsating 587Mazurkas 48 Purity 591Minuets 54 Quietude 591Polkas 61 Race 599Tangos 94 Railroad 6o8Valses Lentes 78 Religioso 616Valses 65 Sadness 621Hunting 186 Sea-storm 651Impatience 194 Sinister 663Joyfulness 202 Wedding 671Love-themes 209 Western 665As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would whisper , " 28 , " if women were silently chattering ; " 140 , " if a festival were in progress ; or " 202 , " if the screen actors and actresses were finding happiness . But just as often , he would indulge his sardonic fancy by a contrast between the musical mood and the text of the two- or three-reeler . When a clergyman showed up on the screen , Oscar sometimescalled for " 165 , " which was " Grotesque , " and one of our favorites , the Orgy music , " 487 , " was used when , for example , an old woman like Whistler 's " Mother " was prayingor watching vainly at a window for her long-lost boy to return home . Actually , the " Purity " music , " 591 , " went greatp136when hero and villain were fighting , and when romantic male actors were giving a heroine their strongest line , the " Chase " music , " 599 , " was extraordinarily effective . Or so it seemed to us . Emily , gentle soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sacrilegious or cynical in our interpretations . I always thought it remarkable that the " Orgies " and " Purity " were taken by the editors from the same suite , Bizet 's " L'Arlesienne . " The program that evening had opened with a two-reel drama called The Yellow Jacket Mine , which had been followed by a comedy , An Ample Dinner ( in which pies were thrown with telling effect ) , and The Man from Boston , which had a satirical slant . The newsboy , I remember , wore rimmed spectacles and quoted Virgil ( inaccurately ) as he sold papers to a type who looked like President Eliot of Harvard . The Boston piece went slightly over the heads of the Ashton audience . Emily brushed a tear from her cheek when the President Eliot type stepped into a coal hole on Beacon Street . The Yellow Jacket Mine , the Mormons understood , but deplored , because Brigham had discouraged the faithful from delving for gold when it was more sound and important to raise carrots , which were known to the Gentiles as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar chose " 151 , " entitled " Fire-fighting , " and the boys stamped and roared . I had often called on Oscar after hours and thought nothing of entering the picture tent from the front , without knocking . As I crossed the floor toward his back room , however , I made so much noise that I could not retreat , although I became aware at that same instant that Oscar was not alone , although he most certainly was in bed . It was Altha who threw open the flap of the tarpaulin , much afraid and expectingthe worst . When she saw who it was , she was almost as troubled as if I had been Nephi , who was out of town . Altha was dressed , but disarranged ; Oscar was in his flannel nightshirt.  | " I did n't mean to do it , " Altha said . I nodded sympathetically . " Of course not . I understand , " I said , as reassuringly as I could . She looked at Oscar , who was sitting on the edge of the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Oscar 's fault . . . He did n't expect me . He never asked me to come , " said Altha . " I 'll have to tell Nephi . " " Be brave , and keep your mouth shut , " Oscar said . Altha looked at me , and I smiled . " Keep your sense of proportion , " I said . But I was wondering how to manage an exit gracefully , and let the drama proceed . Surely , I thought , whateveranyone might think of as sinful had already been perpetrated , and if the sin were left in suspension , as it were , it might turn out to be more troublesome than if it reached its natural conclusion . I was sure that it would be better to let them play their own scene , according to their emotions , judgment , intensity and sense . Furthermore , I could not explain to Oscar , in Altha 's presence , that we both were conspiring to contribute further to a felony , the gravity of which , in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they had been so rudely interrupted . " I 'll leave you , so you can talk things over , but " ( to Altha ) " for God 's sake do n't confess . Nephi would lose his faith in womankind , and for a man like him there 's nothing worse than that . And think of how sad Emily would be . " I finally made my awkward exit . What occurred after that , I did not witness , but Altha did not leave the motion-picture tent until after one o'clock A.M. , and when she got home , I was there alone , because Emily and Wise were strolling along Henry 's Fork and the virginal sister was promising to wait for Wise until spring . If by then he had not changed his mind , she would see how Nephi and the elders would feel about an engagement . Altha was calm , in fact , quite serene and kissed me in a sisterly way before she went to her own and Nephi 's double bed . Since Oscar was going in The Hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Altha decided it would be better to part on the date ordained by the ReclamationService and to pile up a few memories for Altha to treasure through the winter , and forever after . She did not suffer a nervous breakdown or an emotional relapse , and Nephi was even happier on returning from his trip than he had been before departing for the fateful missionary meeting . In later years I often thought how lucky Nephi was to have such a brave and splendid wife who had spiritual stature enough to sustain her own repentance and accept the full consequences of her impulsive behavior . The next night , we got the Dilly 's trunk and stuff started over the mountain , and the night after that The Lake burned down . For a while it seemed as if Torrance would be the principalvictim of that conflagration . Dawn Torrance , so amiable , ample , winsome , cheerful and affectionate , arrived finally and lived with Norman at the Ashton Hotel . He was so fond of her and there was so little privacy , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors or walls that Norman , pleased as a rooster , borrowed Oscar 's little refuge at the rear of the motion-picturetent so that he and his wife might be alone , between the end of lunch and one o'clock P.M. , at which hour good Government employees resume their Reclamation tasks . Those who observed this rendezvous smiled tolerantly and thought it was touching that young married folks should be so fond of each other . On the evening the bordel burned , Torrance had saluted Dawn before breakfast , at high noon and twice after supper . She was a blonde , with fair skin , and when she was tired , she looked exhausted . So Norman , perfect gent that he was , had slipped out of bed about midnight to avoid disturbing her , had joined our card game at the warehouse , and after I had gone to the Coleman bungalow for some acceptable sleep , Torrance strolled over with Wise , Roby and Kurt to call onp139Madam Lake . There was a jolly company in the enclosure that evening , not too numerous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gruff hospitality . A bunch of the town boys welcomed our Reclamation contingentto the little dance hall , the dining room and ample kitchen in which beer and sandwiches were served , and the girls tripped in and out , radiating robust health ( attested by Doc Puckett 's certificate on each bedroom wall ) and professionalgaiety , one of a good hooker 's best assets . Her feet may be hurting , her temples aching , or her heart may be bruised , but she will dance and do whatever is expected of her , within the local standards of propriety , which vary from state to state , with a smile on her lips , her corsets laced or unlaced , and in the parlor ever a ready word to make her customers feel easierthan they do at home . her full sacrifice of respectability which she has made in the balanced interests of self-defense and the comfort of mankind , according to the Gospel of Spinoza the Second . Norman was paired with Bramble Bertha , a rangy girl who had come into Ashton on the train with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have a whalebone spine . Kipling 's " A Fool There Was " had not been launched upon the world that summer . It was due in several months , according to Divine plan . But Bertha had a hank of hair that reached from her movable scalp down to the back of her undimpled knees and thus had earned the nickname of " Sutherland " sister . Nearly every first-class disorderly house in the country had a girl with long hair , in those days , and another little tomboywhose hair was trimmed in bangs and was relatively short . When Torrance danced , he looked like the Yama-Yama man , all elbows and knees , pointed feet and ears , and highlightsin his complicated nose glasses . He chattered constantly to Bertha , and if she as much as opened her lips to ask for another beer , Norman would say :  | " Now , dearie . You talk too much . " Roby , our warehouse man , was short , broad-shouldered and stocky , with an Oregon twang in his voice . He wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short stub pencil tucked behind one ear . He was dancing with the fat girl , Mollie , built like a plump , squat vase . She wobbled and flowed like pale junket in his resolute arms , which did not reach more than halfway around her . Roby , when he danced a twostep , looked more methodical and serious than ever , and his lips moved silently , as if he were counting the steps in order to make a half-turn at symmetrical intervals . The other dancerslearned his pattern on that fifteen-foot floor and steered their jolly girls accordingly . Between dances the clients munched sandwiches . Madam Lake was proud of her homemade bread and would permit no store bread in her house . On certain mornings , I was told , the whole enclosure would be redolent of yeast and baking fragrance , which covered the less attractive early-morning odors in a cat house . That evening was cool , but not cold enough for a fire in the ample cooking range , so Madam Lake was using a small kerosene stove ( Montgomery Ward SN-124367 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for it . The Madam , that summer , was more than making up for several lean years among the Latter Day Saints . Some time after midnight , when the mild orgy was in an andante which fitted naturally between the opening allegro and the final presto , Kurt Mook , the scrappy little albino Dane , was in his underwear entertaining the group in the parlor with an imitation of a pair of Bulgarian wrestlers , and taking both parts . The men and girls assembled , also the Madam , were so intent on Kurt 's performance that no one noticed that the little oil stove in the kitchen had fed its orange flame higher and higher and that stray oil or grease on the outside had caught fire . A near-by window curtain of artificiallace , also from Montgomery Ward , had swayed too near ,  |p141was  singed and then ignited . Suddenly the revelers in the parlor were aware that the whole kitchen seemed to be blazing . The quick thinkers routed out those who chanced to be relaxing in the bedrooms , among whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer and designer , Norman Torrance . There was no time for reflection , since The Lake was burningand crackling like a tinder box . Bramble Bertha grabbed a bright kimono , and Norman what clothes he could find , but he reached the safety of the sagebrush and the company of his Reclamation friends without an article of clothing of which Anatole France has written that , without them , a man is in no position to right wrongs or give his best service to mankind . Some call them trousers , others pants or britches . Before he had even noticed his lack of them , they had gone up in smoke . The glow could be seen for miles around the countryside and in spite of the awkwardness of the hour , a fire alarm had been sounded in town . The alarm apparatus consisted of a giant gong which was beaten with a two-foot length of steel . The distant din woke me , I hurried to the window , and when I saw the angry glare and the direction from which it came I hustled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roommate , was afield and that his pillow had not been rumpled or even dented . Voices questioned from nearby bedrooms and I told Altha and Emily , as I rushed out into the open , that there seemed to be a fire " over back of the warehouse . " By the time I got as far as the Ashton Hotel I saw Dawn , fully dressed , who hailed me . " Where 's Norman ? " she asked . I had the presence of mind to assure her that we all had been in a card game together and that he already was on the scene of the conflagration . On the fringe of the burning Lake , Wise and Roby , intensely practical men , had borrowed for Norman one of thep142amateur fire fighter 's oilskin outfits and , to my relief , when Dawn and I approached the scene , she spotted Norman , strugglingnobly on the end of a bucket line which , although it was a futile gesture , gave the men something to do . The town marshal in line of duty had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were scantily clad , into the office of the grain elevator a hundred or more yards distant . Everyone had conceded from the beginning that neither the building nor any of its inanimate contents could be saved and the Madam was taking her loss with professional calm . Dawn kept asking me who lived in the house , then in embers . When the fire fighters called it a night , Wise led Normanto his spouse and explained that since they had been among the first to see the blaze , they would have to spend an hour with the town marshal , answering questions the replies to which must be written on insurance forms , in quadruplicate . He also cautioned Dawn against the deceptive chill of the Idaho night air . She permitted me to escort her back to the hotel , which was in a flurry of preparations , making ready to receive the homeless ladies of joy and their landlady . Dawn , who had a clear conscience and an uninquisitive maidenlymind , said good-night sweetly at her door on the second floor , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Torrance , assuring the latter that everything was all right ; that Dawn , as free from suspicion as a meadowlark in spring , was in the arms of Morpheus , and none other . The problem then arose as to how and where we should find , at two A.M. , a pair of trousers , pants or britches which would match those Norman had lost . We did not want to consult Nephi , or any of the pious Mormons , for fear of bruising their sensibilities and injuring the reputation of the Reclamation Service . There was no Gentile clothing store in town . Our task was complicated because Torrance , who had no eye for colors , had been wearing a pair of corduroys of anp143especially vile shade , somewhere between green clay and fresh putty . The proprietor of the Gentile pool room , however , came across with a pair that fitted Torrance , as nearly as anything ever fitted him , but they were much darker . Dawn , who was not highly sophisticated , was , in the words of her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new pants and ask about the old ones , and that would lead the conversationinto dangerous territory . Kurt Mook , the drug clerk , had a brilliant idea . In the new stock he had ordered was some bleaching powder which , if dissolved in gallons of warm water , would remove color from practically anything . Wise , Kurt and I went over to the drug store , mixed up a batch of the bleaching fluid , dipped the dark corduroys into it and removed them when we thought they had reached a shade approximating that of the lost pair of pants . When they were rinsed , wrung and artificially dried , Wise took a brand from the wood stove and burned a large hole in one of the legs , so that Torrance could explain that they had been ruined at the scene of the conflagration before he had been equipped with fire-fighting clothes . Thus he was able , without agitating Dawn , to dispose of the substitutetrousers the next morning , and the tranquility of a marriage , which already had attained a reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More schedules , bids and contracts had to be amended so that Madam Lake could buy what was needed for a new enlargedhook shop , and Roby was considerate enough to spare her a few of the carpenters and bums who could build it . Meanwhile the girls from The Lake , after a short stay at the Hotel Ashton on enforced good behavior , were shipped to Pocatello to await in the roomy stockade there the completionof new quarters in Ashton . We considered it a tribute to our ability to attend to our work faithfully , no matter what distractions occurred , when Crowe , appreciative as always , took steps to secure for all ofp144us that month a raise in pay , and , beginning in September I received $136.84 monthly , instead of the $99.43 I had been paid in August . Just how the various fiscal agents , officials and executives between Idaho and Washington , D.C. , arrived at those quaint figures , I never could discover , but I could spend whatever they gave me with ease and dispatch , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days in August we worked frantically to clean up odds and ends in the Ashton office . Wise had to ride to the dam site with the payroll , and , as always when he had to , he called on his reserve of nervous energy for the three-day trip by saddle horse . Wednesday evening was devoted to a farewell session of music at the Coleman bungalow . Scotty McVeigh , who had come in from Wyoming with some communications from Crowe to Norman , was with us . Besides there were Torrance and Dawn , Altha , Emily , Oscar and Nephi . Scotty and I were leaving early the next morning by saddle horses . Oscar preferred to ride in a wagon driven by Johnny O'Brien . That last evening he was nervous because of Altha and Emily , and was hoping he could make his getaway without dramatics or unfortunate disclosures . Altha was in control , although it was tough for her . Emily , with Wise over in Wyomingand Oscar about to step out of her existence , was the difficult one . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature , would I leave my friend alone with the virgin until we were at a safe distance on the road . " I know myself too well , " Oscar said . " My mind changes , now and then , when it 's under too much pressure , and I become a menace to society . You know I would n't hurt Altha 's feelings for the world . "  | " Why is there always someone whose feelings get hurt ? " I asked , and Oscar sighed . We were both under strain , and wished the ordeal were over . A bad moment came when Nephi , bashful as a school boy , presented us with seventeen-jewel Swiss watches some relativeof his had brought from Switzerland . Oscar 's handsome face turned pale , then red , but he accepted the timepiece with good grace , and I feared he would get drunk that night , later , and might miss the freight wagon . The stars above Ashton , its palpitating women , honest men and movie tent were on the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked , gleamed and swung , high and low , individually , in pairs , groups , constellations and swarms . The moon was in its last quarter , and decently restrained , with a mocking shadow to augment the crescent . The season of night insects had subsided ; the migratory birds were not then assembling in flocks , but they were thinking about it . The early harvest had been gathered , and late crops were still on the fields . Around the town which had been important , from a Reclamation point of view , and no other , the sage was cooling , in anticipation of the frost . The waters of Henry 's Fork were reduced to a trickle , and slime had dried on the stones of its bed , then exposed . A poet has asked about the snows of yesteryear . I will settle for departed fragrances . Basque sheep-herders , of whom there were many in the distanthills , could tell time by the stars as well as the late Thomas Hardy , of whom not one of them had heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be several kinds , with strains from Cotswolds , Merinos , Rambouillets , Lincoins , Shropshires , Hampshires , Oxford Downs , Leicesters and Dorsetts . The Basques knew about things like that . There might have been as many kinds of gophers in one of the colonies around Ashton . The sheep made maddening noises . Gophers were practically silent . Sheep furnished wool ,  |p147reluctantly  . Gophers gave nothing , instinctively , and made holes in which running horses sometimes stepped and sprained their ankles . On starlit nights , in Idaho , one wonderedabout many of those whims of Nature and others of mankind . When the eastern rim of the sky showed a promise of another kind of light , and the starlight thinned , a few of Ashton'swindows flared into orangeness . Restless bums by the railroad track lit inconsequential fires and heated coffee . Roby 's warehouse had banjo torches burning , and the smell of government coffee was stronger than the rest . Scotty McVeighmet Oscar and me at the warehouse . Our trunks and boxes were loaded on Larry O'Brien 's rig . Scotty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and me . Oscar , stretched out on the floor of the wagon , was peacefully asleep before we started . Instead of taking the wagon road which started due south for a mile from Ashton , then veered straight east for a tangent of several miles , Scotty and I , mounted on our four-footed , sure-footed , semi-domestic animals , listed on the government records as Prince and Jack ( Jack being a mare , assigned to me ) , hit straight across the rising plain toward Squirrel Meadows . The vegetation was not varied on that stretch of the ride , and the topography was consistent . We had our bedrolls , a feed of oats apiece to sustain our transportation , two rifles , Remington .32 Specials , and in my saddle bag I had placed my three letters from Elizabeth Wong . We had Smith and Wesson six-shooters , .38 calibre , in holsters , and ammunition . Scotty had been over the trail several times . For me , it was a new experience , some details of which I undoubtedly missed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , and some understanding about the comfort and enduranceof horses , so we started on a walk and did not urge them to a single-foot gait for quite a while . It was on that trip , when Scotty and I had a degree of privacy that some peoplep148never attained , that I heard more about the escape into Wyoming by Dot Rusby , Roberta Arney , and the Dilly , or Miss Hat . Scotty told me that before the girls from the reform school had ridden horseback two miles , they began to show extreme discomfort because of the bruised and welted state of their posteriors . The girls were game , but had human limitations . So Scotty and the Dilly had persuaded them to lie face downwardacross the saddles , while their tractable horses were led by means of hitching ropes . When Dot and Roberta got tired , which was soon , the party slowed down , and they walked for a while . When the young fugitives from what was loosely called justice felt less uncomfortable , the girls , at their own suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spell . As mile after mile was put behind them , and no signs of pursuit materialized , they all stopped , in the shelter of a coulee . Scotty built a small fire which he screened with a blanket ; Miss Hat arranged other folded blankets to serve as a soft seat for the injured members , and sat with her arm around Dot , chatting reassuringly of this and that . Miss Hat was rich , and had been reared in comparative comfort , but she was as game as Battling Nelson and as chummy with Scotty as any man could be . And Scotty , being endowed with much understanding , responded matter-of-factly . Roberta , the sturdier of the two girls , strolled with Scotty some distance from the campfire . " You seem to be a regular guy , " Roberta said . " Is this set-up all right , do you think ? We 're under a lot of obligations to this Dilly . " " She 's having the time of her life , " Scotty said . Roberta grinned . He nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Scotty said . The night was chill and in order to keep Roberta fromp149getting cold or feeling slighted , he had sat down , spread a blanket and pillowed her head , face down , on his lap . " We hit it off fine , " Scotty said . I knew that he was capable of unselfishness , and never took the short view when a longer vista would prove wiser in the end . Having left Ashton by night , they got within striking distance of Squirrel Meadows , in spite of their handicaps , before the sun was far above the horizon , and , considering everything , in fairly good condition . But the young girls were pretty well exhausted , were still in Idaho , and would have to by-pass Cascade Road House on account of the alumni from their St. Anthony institution who were stationed there . " That brother of mine 'll turn me in , if I give him a chance . Dot , too . And then you and the Dilly 'll be in Dutch for givingus a hand , " Roberta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think Dot sort of likes the Dilly . Just how much I could n't say . " Time will tell , " Scotty said . Already he was making plans against a lonely winter , for Roberta was the right sort and would never make things tough for him , or lose her head . Scotty had ridden on ahead , to confer with Spinoza , who had come up to scratch magnificently . Without a thought of the risk he might be taking , Wilfred had smuggled the two girls and the Dilly into his own secluded room , which was a lean-to out back of the storehouse . He had put up window curtains and shades he had dyed himself . The floor was scrubbed clean , the bedding was free from vermin , and on the walls he had tacked some black and white reproductions of the work of a painter named Picasso , and another called Matisse , which modern decorations caused the Dilly to pause and reflect and the reform-school girls to laugh , a demonstrationthey were warned against , on account of the roustabouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotty werep150able to keep the women under cover throughout the day and the following night , so that the correctional bruises were partially healed , after periodical applications of salve , oils and ointments which Miss Hat took shy pleasure in spreading . Spinoza , who became chummy with Miss Hat almost instantly , found her attitude natural , if not touching . " She 's been starved for affection  --  to give , not necessarily to take , " Spinoza said to Scotty . " Imagine how you would feel if they turned you loose at Vassar . " " Bryn Mawr might be better , " suggested Scotty . " That has a Scottish name . " The worst moment had occurred that first day when Milt Arney had blown into the Squirrel Meadows camp unexpectedlyand had to be kept well away from the storehouse , where Roberta was squinting through a slit between curtain and window frame , with Scotty 's .32 special in her hand . Milt , who had a strong if not musical voice , had luckily advertised his approach by singing a ballad he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been five long years in this prison , And I 've five more years to stay , For knifing a man in an alley , And taking his money away . " Milt had been sent by the St. Anthony ex-guard to Squirrel Meadows on an errand . The Cascade cook-stove grate had been broken , by inexpert or unnecessarily rough handling . After having subdued his wife , Jessie , who attacked him , on account of his carelessness , with a stick of stove wood , Gary Ketchen had sent Milt , who could easiest be spared from almostanywhere , to get a new grate . Spinoza had a few extra grates and stove linings , but he cached them away , promptly , and sent Milt on to Ashton , with a pint of whiskey to cheer him on his way and put him in a mood that would insure hisp151absence from duty during several days . Roberta , still fingeringthe .32 Special wistfully , watched her brother ride away . The family life of the South Boise Arneys , before and after both of the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither had the brother-sister relationship been affectionate in the reform school , in spite , or because of Milt 's predilection toward incest , which had cropped out at an early age . By the time Scotty had got that far with his story , we had reached the section of the trail where the hitherto gently tilted plane had become accidentalized with hills , draws , rifts and gullies , and the plants , shrubs , bushes and scrub trees began to introduce the leitmotif of Divine imagination and profligacy . We sighted some grouse , in the boughs of a small fir tree , drew beads on them but did not fire . They were so tame and content , and nearer Squirrel Meadows , where we should eat Spinoza 's best , there would . be plenty more of them . They were of the type known as " blue grouse , " with a dim sheen on the feathers of the males and a quiet mottled hue on the females . There was a suggestion of blue , if the depths of gray marble are blue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bright-colored berries . The late flowers still were blooming without ostentation , but noticeable , if one rode slowly enough and looked sharply . Their floral ancestors must have been noticed by Sacajawea , the Indian squaw who had been stolen by Crows and , returning , guided some of the first settlers into Idaho . Nothing grows on the moon , they say , and not much on Mars . Our sun , according to astronomers , is not one of the finest , but it was doing well enough that day , and the fragmentwhich had become our planet had qualities which , if they are excelled elsewhere , elsewhere should be proud of itself . Occasional springs , betrayed by vivid colors on their fringe , had frog willows growing around them , the same kindp152that Sacajawea might have woven into baskets . I recognized choke cherries , wild gooseberries and some roots like sassafras , but not exactly . Meanwhile our horses stepped softly . We were walking them again . Squirrel Meadows could wait ; our talk could wait . Reclamation , government and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We dismounted and drank , from hands icily dripping and cupped for the purpose . As Scotty and I got nearer Squirrel Meadows , the landscapeadapted itself to our perspective , and became intimate , rather personal , as if each cluster of trees ; rocks with ferns ; moss and lichens ; each small wild animal ; the birds , alone , in pairs , in platoons and flocks ; each natural clearing ; trickling spring ; or flower-studded plot of wild grasses was either being shy and apprehensive , or inviting us in barely perceptible ways , like hopeful slave girls whose eyes for an instant let themselves become individualized among massed eyes , breasts , hips and shoulders in a market . Staid and slow as he was , Scotty was sensitive , too , and did not hold our horses to the trail but let them wander this way and that , maintaining our general direction , so that they could dislodge the choicest leaves from a bush or stoop to snatch a wisp of grass . Scotty had a way with horses , a little stricter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince had learned , when Scotty was aboard , to turn his head back and inquire with his ears before halting in order to lower his head and reach a morsel that seemed to have grown itself expressly for him . Jack , my mare , on the other hand , would halt first , then turn and inquire , and reach down before I had had much time to consent . What I would not give to know what a horse mind registers and a horse personality feels on a trip like that , from rising plateau to foothills and mountains , on a clear September day . Sometimes , when a grouse or pheasant rose , whirring , our horses would shy , and almost step sidewise from under us . Again they would simply flip up their ears , as if to show they were deep in reverie . As a matter of fact , Ip153reacted unevenly , too . Sometimes I was startled and felt a shock or tingle all along my nerves . Again , I ' heard and saw , surprised but not physically affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dilly , Spinoza and those nice reform-school girls . " He 's a card , that Spinoza , " Scotty said , with the tolerant smile that made him look like a mischievous owl , without eyeglasses . " There 's not much he ca n't do . " This was apropos Spinoza 's suggestion , while the girls and the Dilly were under his protection , that the trio be disguised , not in an obvious way , but to make it more probable that the word would not get back from Wyoming to St. Anthony that Miss Hat and the flagellated pair who were " wanted " had passed that way , and were somewhere " in The Hole , " Jackson Hole being fifty miles square . In Idaho , as in all new states , the frontier tendency toward anarchy and self-expression among sworn officers of the law and citizens-atlargehad by no means subsided , and if busybodies in St. Anthony , egged on by a female politician named Miss Chamberlain , who was a trustee of the school and had , on the publicplatform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyoming , those officers and citizens would probably ignore state boundaries and drag the girls back westward , for more whaling and confinement . " Wil cut Bobbie 's hair " ( Bobbie meaning Roberta ) " and fitted some loose pants , a shirt and leather vest for her , so she looked more like a man , when she was dressed , " Scotty said . " She could have passed for a powder monkey or a flunky anywhere , the way Spinoza fixed her . " " That other one could n't , " I said . " Do you know what Wil did ? He rigged up Dot to look forty years older , by fixing her hair and eyebrows , and blackingout a couple of front teeth . The clothes helped , too . Dot looked like an old bag . Pretend you 're lazy , and sag , ' that'sp154what Wil told Dot , and she did . I hardly knew her myself , " Scotty said . I waited to hear about the Dilly , and knew from the way Scotty had led up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed along there . " That Dilly , " Scotty said , and sighed . " When Wil scolded her , she shivered and promised to be good , just like a little kid , but she could n't seem to follow his instructions . It was that bloody little hat . Spinoza took it away , and chucked it in the swill can , and she bit her lips and tried to be game , but she started to shake . He hit her a lick with a yardstick . I did n't think he could get tough like that . She stopped shaking , and Wil put a wide Stetson on her , with a floppy brim . She wore it out of camp , when we hit for Edwards ' Ranch , the hardest leg of the trip . But the first time she and Dot dropped back and got off their horses , to go into the bushes , back came the Dilly with the rim of the Stetson torn off and the crown tipped over to the same old angle . After that , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ? That 's a new one on me , " Scotty said . Of course , with the Dilly in her famous style of headgear the whole party might have been spotted for miles distant . " You got around Cascade , all right ? " I asked . " Sure , " said Scotty . " The girls could ride by that time . That is , Dot could . She had what looked like a white tender skin , but it was tough as tripe . Bobbie , got up like a roughneckand looking like one , had the tenderest pelt , and picked up a little infection . When her cheeks got red , on her face , I mean to say , and she worked up a little fever , I got scared . So did the Dilly and Dot . Bobbie did n't beef , or whine , but she got madder and madder at that Miss Chamberlain and swore that some time she 'd get even . When she got lightheaded , she raved about the Director , too , who had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whaled , to help hold her down . "  |p155It  was not hard for Scotty to convey that he had been on a spot , and how Roberta 's fever and blood-poisoning had worriedhim . He had hidden the girls just the other side of Cascade Creek , well away from the camp , the road and the telephone line , rode hell for breakfast across-country to Moran , nearly getting bogged in the swamp at the head of Jackson Lake , and brought Doc Shaw back with him . That trip , over the roughest kind of country , was thirty-five miles each way . " When Doc saw the setup , with poor Bobbie lying on her stomach , Dot cutting firewood , and the Dilly putting hot rags on Bobbie 's seat , he laughed , and Bobbie , with a fever of 103 , looked up at him and asked him what he was laughing at . She said that if his arse felt like hers , he 'd have it in a sling , " said Scotty . " Doc fixed her up ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I saw the look on Doc 's face . He stopped laughing when he examined her close , and his eyes went dead . Doc has n't got a poker face , " Scotty said . " But Doc fixed her up , " he added . " Where are they now ? " I asked . Scotty grinned . " They 're not too far away , " he said . " I 'll take you there , the first moonlight night . " " Not in camp at Moran ? " I asked . " Hell , no , " Scotty said . " If they 'd showed up there , Crowe would'a had to kick ' em out , and everybody 'd known about it , all over five or six states . You 'll see them all right . " I dropped the subject for a time , but could not hold back a final question . " The Dilly ? " I asked . " She 's with ' em , hat and all , " he said.  |p156Before  twilight that day , after Scotty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hours , Larry O'Brien drove in , with Oscar , now rested , relieved and refreshed , a heavy clamshell bucket and about eight bums . The " Meadows , " considered as scenery , had some qualities that remained intact in the mind , composed like a Corot landscape , but the atmospherewas strictly Idaho-Wyoming . There were broad fields of grass where , by some freak of nature , the woods had been cleared without the aid of man , so no trace of fallen trunks or uprooted stumps was visible . Squirrel grass dominated the other grasses in those wide open fields , a foamlike grass of the genus Hordeum , related to barley and having long awns , the books would have us believe . The effect of a patch of squirrel grass , in terms of color , is buff with mist and it is not tall enough to sway much in the wind or short enough for lawns . It is a decorative grass . Horses will eat it , sparingly , but , when other grasses are at hand , preferothers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare trunks reaching upward for the sun because they were so close together that the branches could not spread . The carpet of needles was several inches thick , of a cinnamon shade related to barley and buff . Some of the evergreenswere cedars , others were Douglas fir , and a few were larches , and one or two the black hemlock known to Socrates.  |p157None  was much taller than 100 feet . On the fringe of the meadows were bushes of mountain juniper over which deer could jump and frequently did . The course of Squirrel Creek , of course , was marked by cottonwoods , as yellow as the robes of an empress , with pale taffy shades and a soupcon of attenuatedblood orange . With dark Veronese green of the conifers , cottonwood yellow was in the best of landscape taste , and restrainedly effective . Spinoza would not have permitted his surroundings to be so flashily colored as to suggest abandon or vulgarity . In sunlight , the vistas , whichever way one turned , were radiant ; before twilight they were evocative of blank contemplation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not look at them too long . Then there was dusk , and would be starlight . In the bunkhouse mingled scholars off the reservation , rounders , gold bricks , Bohunks and bums . Some cared for views , some did not . All cared enormously for food , as prepared by Spinoza and served by the flunkies he had chosen according to some principle of his that worked , but the nature of which was hidden from me . One flunky was so deaf that if a six-shooter had been fired six inches from his ear , he would not have heard it . The other had St. Vitus dance and , when not otherwise occupied , went into a kind of rigadoon . Still , the deaf boy interpreted signals and the twitcher dropped no tin cups , saucers or tin dishes . Before supper a bum and I went fishing in the creek , with bamboo poles and tackle borrowed from Spinoza , who , like the Chinese philosopher , was said to use " straight hooks " so that the fish could either be caught or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaned us , however , were crooked , curved and sharply barbed . The trout we hooked were either landed against their wills or the best trout showmen on earth . The bum ate his on the creek bank , and mine , too , because I did not want to catch enough for all my friends , or be served trout when they were eating stew , with roughlocks on the side.  | " Roughlocks " in the dining rooms of that country consisted of an indigestible clot of baked macaroni and cheese . Spinoza , characteristically enough , had found growing in the woods nearby an herb that was not quite basil , nor chervil , but something in between , with a tang of laurel or rosemaryfor remembrance . This he introduced into boiling water in which macaroni was to be cooked , and the flavor caused the bums to heap their plates and growl for more . In any group of men , there is likely to be one who acts like an outcast , or remains aloof . Such a one I saw lurking in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself out there , after the others had finished . Spinoza had introduced the man to me as " George . " George was tall , had excellent , if not precious manners , and made it clear that he kept to himself because he did not want company . George had been at the Meadows six days , which was against all rules and would have brought on a tirade from Crowe , had Crowe been informed of the special arrangements . Spinoza followed principles , not rules . It seemed that George had been hired in Boise by the Head Fumbler , B. F. Stoutemyer , and had been told by that high functionary that he , George , would act as head timekeeperat the Jackson Lake Dam . When George had got as far as Squirrel Meadows he learned that Joe Markham , a young man ( first baseman ) from Providence , Rhode Island , was head timekeeper and was doing very well in that capacity . No one , unless possibly the Fumbler , knew where George was from , but George did not fly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by himself , to think the situation over . Spinoza , in his tactful way , had suggested that Crowe was looking for an assistant head-timekeeper and the difference in pay was nominal . Still , when George came back from his conference with himself , he was nervous and harassed , althoughmost considerate . He could not make up his mind whether ( a ) to go back , via Ashton , to wherever he had come from ; ( b ) to continue to the dam site and accept a secondaryp159role ; ( c ) to lie down on the floor , on which he always slept at night , and quietly stay there . Spinoza had urged him to stay at the Meadows as his guest and take all the time he needed for the difficult decision . Spinoza talked with George in the evenings , after everyone else had gone to bed , and when George was in the mood , about every other day . Wilfred had a theory that when a man hesitates about what would appear to be a simple decision that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision is a grave one , and fraught with possibilities that may affect the future course of the decider 's life . A wrong turning , at such a psychic crossroads , might lead a man into pathways of existence which had not been intended for him , or for which he was unfit or too humanlyvaluable . " I should force myself . I should make up my mind , " George had said , and Spinoza had sensed , in astonishment , that in George 's troubled mind the question of to be head timekeeper or not to be was obscured by banks of storm clouds that would drive nearer , and discharge torrents , sleet , hail , thunders and lightning , before they passed on , and the question-horizon was clear . Spinoza had not asked George , as everyone else did , why he slept on the floor , which was drafty . While George was his guest , Spinoza also slept on the floor , and found it damnably uncomfortable , leaving his back aching , his limbs and members lame and sore . George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeper , had been deeply offended , and had not spoken to Spinoza for twenty-four hours , but Spinoza , with that eighth or tenth sense of his , let George sulk , and still slept on the floor and insisted that he liked it . The situation had been complicated just at the time when Spinoza thought George had been on the verge of accepting the secondary place in the timekeeping force . Joe Markham had heard , through Wise , about George , whom Stoutemyer had hired , and had offered to step down from the head time/keepership and give the man a chance to straighten out . That George was not a sissy had already been demonstrated , because when a big angry bum , inflamed by cheap alcohol , had broken a table and bench and threatened to brain Spinoza , George had stepped in and , single-handed , thrown the big bum out of the mess-house . But having given the berserk hobo the rush , George , still panting , disappeared into the woods , hatless , and did not return until dawn . " George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's com-plex . " That evening we talked about the Mann Act , a phase of government which had come into being ahead of parcel post , the income tax and woman suffrage . According to Spinoza , who had browsed in law books quite a bit , the case of Idaho versus Dot and Roberta , also the Dilly , Doc Shaw , Scotty McVeigh and several of the rest of us , had fascinating implications . Brakemen who had paid for the railroad tickets of stranded hookers , as an act of kindness , to get them from one state to another , had already been indicted under the vague new law . " Who put up the money for the saddle horses ? " Spinoza asked . George was sitting apart , sometimes seeming to take a perfunctory interest in the talk , but , in general , inattentive . He had his own problem , and was clicking it back and forth between the cushions of his mind the way Willie Hoppe would practice billiards . " Hell , the horses had been hired by the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. ReclamationService , " Scotty said . " We just borrowed them a while . " " Were you and the Dilly leading the horses on which the fugitives were prone , when you crossed the state line ? " Spinozaasked . " If I was , the lead line was slack , so the government horsep161was walking over of his own accord , " Scotty said . " Now who could prove a thing like that ? " he added . " And since when is a government-rented horse a public conveyance ? " " A nice question , " Spinoza said , and thought of it a while . " Had the lead line been taut , you would have been guilty . " " And who said anything about immoral purposes ? " demandedScotty . " If anyone is guilty , it 's the government , who busted the Mann Act through its agent , the horse . " " The Dilly is in the clear , under the Act , " Spinoza said . " Women can buy transportation for their girl friends , as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illicit earnings , if any , of the girl she has helped . Girls can get rooms together in a Y.W.C.A. or a hotel without inscribing false names on a register , or pretending they are married . " George , reluctant and diffident , rose to his feet . " Men can get married to each other in Albania , " he said , and sat down again , flustered but insistent . " The hell you say ! " Scotty said . " Would the men be protected from women 's breach-of-promise suits ? " But George had gone back into his shell , and would dispenseno further information . The impression I already had that George was well-bred and somewhat of a scholar was reinforced , however . He had acted as if he were in a class room , on equal terms with his instructor . He also had correctedOscar when our Norwegian virtuoso had referred to " Ciribiribin " as " Cheribbaribbin . " We all slept in bunks that night , without feeling the necessity for scrutinizing the wooden frames or the blankets beforewe rolled in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spinoza took Scotty and me aside . " I think George might go along with you two , if you asked him just right , " Spinoza said . " I 'll miss him here , but the move would be good for him . " So Scotty and I told George we had an extra saddle horsep162and that if he would like to ride with us , and look over the layout at the dam site , we would enjoy his company . " I 'm not good company , " George said , but he was wavering , and we finally persuaded him . He thanked Spinoza , politely , for all Wil had done , got out his tarpaulin and , because he was not skillful at rolling his things into blankets , took what he had into a nearby clearing and when his bed roll was ready , sat on it , alone , until the horses were fed , groomed , blanketed and saddled for the trip to Cascade . Oscar got into Larry O'Brien 's rig , and another freighter had a load of horseshoes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wagon freighters got started first , but we passed them on the first steep grade . The summit of the pass was between us and the road house where we would spend the night . On that stretch of the road , it was not possible to ride across country very much , because the woods had given way to forests , the coulees were ravines , and ledges of rock , fantastically up-ended by geologic upheavalscropped up on every side . We had to ford the creek three times in the first five miles , and we walked our horses all the way , up grade , and down . There were a few level stretches along the sides of the mountains . I noticed that George was familiar with horses , in a way . I think he had ridden quite a bit , before , but never on a government horse with a McClellan saddle . He had buckled his stirrups up too short , but the first time we stopped , he led his horse behind a rock and when they emerged , the stirrups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly by direct questions bearing on the past , or United States geography , we chose our subjects cautiously . That he was scornful of women , either young or old , fugitives , or pillars of respectablesociety , was also clear . When I mentioned B. F. Stoutemyer , and the large trout the Fumbler had caught , George 's manner seemed to indicate that he thought highly of the head accountant in Boise and was grateful to him for offeringp163a job to one who did not have one . I sensed that George had never had a job , unless it was as instructor or assistant professor in some college , and because George talked rather freely about the east coast and its institutions , saying nothing that a man of his perceptivity could not have gleaned from newspapersand magazines , I assumed that he was not from the East . Furthermore , because George had shown some perplexitywhen Scotty had used expressions that were **29;7531;TOOLONG , and George was as free of any trace of Southern accent as an Eskimo could be , I began to suspect that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Seattle , or San Francisco . I did not care particularly where George had come from , unless the knowledge would help me to make George feel more at ease . But we were all seeing such an astonishing array of the beauties of nature that there was no use talking about nature , scenery , the fauna and flora , or the combinations of color that resulted from the refraction of rays of white light . The fact that George , wearing a flannel shirt in the sunshine , while riding over a rough mountain road , perspired very freely , was distressing to him . The moisture and odor of sweat made him faintly ill , or so it seemed . He would stop whenever he saw accessible water , hide himself behind some foliage or natural obstruction , and wash from the waist up , soak his shirt , slap it against stones , wring it out , and put it on , damp , so that for a mile or so the color would be uniform and the telltale armpits would not be conspicuous . Scotty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me in the matter of years , repressed his instinct toward railleryand hit upon a subject which held George 's attention and on which our indecisive new acquaintance was almost childishlyeager for exact information . So Scotty explained , as best he could , how timekeeping was done , on Reclamation jobs that were bossed directly by the Government engineers , with no contractors between the men and the strict supervision.  |p164Timekee|ping  , per se , would not have been too difficult , if Government employees had been permitted to accomplish it as other folks did . Men worked a given number of hours at a stated rate of pay . But in Washington , D.C. , the Reclamation accountants and citified engineers had to deal with politicians , special interests , lobbyists , journalists ( as the wrong kind of newspapermen were called ) , statisticians , and , now and then , a statesman . So they needed a lot of information that did not interest the men paid by the hour for doing specified work in such a manner that they did not get fired . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-rock men would work from eight o'clock until 10.15 , let us say , as part of a team , or cuadrillo , consisting of two men who swung sixteen-pound sledges , another who sat and held the drill between his legs with his hands which would be mangled if the hammer-swinger missed . Those three were served by a boy , or powder monkey , who took dulled drills to the blacksmith shop to be sharpened , and brought sharp drills back to his gang . There is not much hand drilling done today , in machine-minded North America , and thus much poetry of motion has been lost . Anyone who was thrilled by precision , self-confidence , bravado and the rhythmic clang of sledge upon drill-head , who liked to watch the co-ordinated movements of muscles , backs , and moving implements , the shuffling , shifting and turning of the drill by the key man , seated , who risked his hands at least thirty times each minute , does not get the same kick out of seeing and hearing a steam drill in operation . No one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its movement and music remain to haunt the memory . At 10.15 , our quartet of drillers , men and boy , might be sent by Hunter , the superintendent , over to the roadway to dispose of a protruding ledge that was making things tough for the freighters , or had crippled a horse . There the drillers would spend an hour and forty-five minutes . The whistlep165would blow , all hands would eat , and in the afternoon the drillers would go back to the bedrock at the dam site , but would be switched to the powder house on the mountainside to unload some dynamite that Crowe had decided , very wisely , should be handled by experienced rock men rather than untrained hoboes who had little , if anything , to live for . In the system of costkeeping devised in Washington , by the aides of the Great White Father , and which had been scrambledwith ordinary timekeeping like eggs with salami , the work done by drillers on the bedrock under the dam was chargeable to a certain Account Number , say 147533 . Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Account Number 147513 . Work at or near the powder house was chargeable to Account Number 147588 . A given driller , say Jaime Echegaray ( who had a sister , Helen , in Boise ) would be paid $2.75 for an eight-hour day . On the day we are describing , he had spent 51/4 hours on bedrock excavation ; 1 3/4 hours on road construction ; and 1 hour at the powder house . So Jaime 's $2.75 is divided , in the books , as follows : Account Number 147513 $ .6oAccount Number 147533 1.81Account Number 147588 .34$2.75That is not as simple as it looks . The accurate figures would be : $0.6015625 , $1.8046875 , and $0.34375 . Since not even in Washington can copper pennies be split into fractions , the odd cent is added to the highest figure , and thus bedrock excavation is cheated nearly one cent , to the microscopicadvantage of road work and powder house . In several years that accumulation of error would run into money , and clerks would work overtime many nights and holidays trying to find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively , and pursedp166his lips sternly as we rode along . Because George 's headpiece and nervous system were balled up , just then , his dislike for complicated arithmetic appeared to him as a weakness to be mastered , and he decided before we reached Cascade to take the secondary job . My face lit up . " Joe Markham 's a good scout , " I said . George stiffened . " I hardly think our relationship will be of a personal nature , " he said . " That would depend . " He did not say on what it would depend , and no one asked him . We rode over the hump , and halted to see Wyoming from the crest of the divide . George opened up again . " Superficially beautiful , but probably insidious , " was his comment on what the Indians had called " Maughwauwama . " " Nature , if you will pardon my saying so , can be grossly overdone . " Then he added : " Damn and blast ! I 'm unpresentable again . " With those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his torso , head , arms , hands and shirt . " He 's complex , but he 's a humdinger , all right , " Scotty said . The more he saw and heard of George , the better Scotty liked him . He had never known anyone like George before , and neither had anyone else . Before we got to Cascade , which we could see from the divide and still was fourteen miles distant , by road , George betrayed his curiosity about the man who would be his immediatesuperior , Joe Markham . " Has he any . . . degrees ? " George asked , in a way that implied George hoped Joe had none . " A diploma from a high school back in Providence , " I said . " Has he had long experience in government accounting ? " asked George . " None at all , before he struck Ashton , " I said . " Is he above the average in intelligence ? " " A little , " I said . " He backs up the catcher when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said George . And he added with asper/ity , " And not because I could not play passably at several of the games . " " Football ? " I asked , thinking it was the most improbable . He turned so pale and got so dizzy that I could have bitten off my tongue . He lowered his head , recovering , and said , with effort , eyes half closed : " I broke a boy 's back . " That was the end of intimate conversation that day , but I knew we should be friends . At Cascade , the deplorable condition of the road house and the unsavory character of its personnel was more than balanced by George 's scorn of it and them . " The man is a stinkard , " George said , after a few words with Gary Ketchen . " The woman is worse , " I suggested . " She wears more clothes , and women , of course , can never keep themselves quite clean , " said George . " There are degrees , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tin cans were alive with late flies . Scotty , who had had words with the Ketchens before , took matters in hand . " Clean up that mess , " he told Ketchen . " Since when are you my boss ? " Ketchen asked . " You wo n't have any boss , if you do n't get busy . Crowell break your neck whenever he comes through , " Scotty said . Ketchen aimed a kick at one of the reform-school boys who cut across the tableau . " Clean up them cans , " Ketchen said . The boy , in spite of the fact that Mrs. Ketchen was within hearing distance , made a suggestion to Gary as to what he could do with himself , which was piquant but highly impracticable . " All of you get busy , " Scotty said , and sulkily the Ketchens and their helpers made the cook shack and mess house fairly presentable.  | " I ride the gang here whenever I can , " said Scotty . " They wo n't clean the place . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , too much , I 'd know what they 'd found out about Bobbie . So far , so good . She 's safe . " It was not lost on me that Scotty had singled out Bobbie for his solicitude , and did not mention Dot or the Dilly . He was not sore with either of them , but Bobbie was for him , and he would see to it that she was not institutionalized again , or abused by members of her family . I noticed , too , that when Scotty came across a reference to Miss Chamberlain , the lady politico , or politica , on whom Roberta had sworn revenge , he read it carefully , five or six times , cut it from The Statesman with his jackknife  --  Scotty could do wonders with a jackknife  --  and placed it carefully with others in a billfold he always had with him.  |p169After  our evening and night at Cascade , where we all slept out , and even the Spartan George accepted the loan of an extra blanket from Oscar , I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The hosts and attendants , the bunks and cabins , and probably the stables were lousy , if horses can support vermin . One bad smell contended with another . There were no catalogues , either " Monkey Ward " or Sears Roebuck ( in that country the second choice ) , in the latrine . The food was greasy , the tin dishes dirty , and the meat that appeared on Ketchen 's scrawled expense accounts as beef was undoubtedly elk , which he had slaughtered on his own in order to pocket the beef money . Even canned milk tasted sour in those surroundings . " Crowe knows what 's going on around here , " Scotty said . " It works out this way . After Ashton , which is pretty soft for the men , and Squirrel Meadows , where they 're treated like kings , this miserable dump starts ' em kicking . Edwards ' Ranch is better , but not too much , so when they get to the main camp at Moran , it looks like heaven to them . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't figure he was that much of a psychologist . " " Crowe is everything but a quitter , " Scotty said . George , having overheard the word " quitter " looked hurt and went into the woods for a while by himself.  | " How does Crowe take to Spinoza ? " I asked . " He loves the crazy bastard , " Scotty said . " He wants him to go in to Moran when we have to close down Squirrel Meadows . Crowe likes to hear Spinoza talk , after hours . He thinks that kind of talk 'll help his wife from getting lonesome . There wo n't be many women in camp . Just the nurse , who 's a good scout but never says much . . . " " And Dawn Torrance , " I reminded him . " Dawn 'll live with Norman in one of Sheffield 's cabins . I hope she can keep house , " said Scotty . " I hope she 'll have time , " Oscar said and grinned . " One of the skinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little shack , since he 'd brought the woman all the way from Montana . You must have known them . They used to live in Sidney . " I remembered the skinner , Ross Kulmus , and his wife . His wife was called Sooner , which Spinoza , when they went through Squirrel Meadows , had discovered was a corruption of Sonja . That night at Cascade , the thermometer went down to 18 , not very cold for September . Oscar was faced with a peculiar problem , that of protecting his violin . He could not leave it in any of the buildings , for fear the velvet-lined case and the cloth would attract some fleas . So he took it to bed with him , under the stars and the frost . In the morning , we got our own breakfast , out of doors , and Scotty , George and I pushed on toward Edwards ' Ranch . We got as far as Grassy Lakes by the time the sun was above the horizon and there , where fish were jumping , reflections of tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bears watched us suspiciously from other trees , just off the road , George broke down again , to a limited extent . " I should be candid , not ashamed , " he said . " Yesterday I pretended indifference to beauty . That was a pose . " " Do n't worry . You 'll get used to it , " Scotty said.  | " I do not wish to get used to it , " said George , pursing his lips again . " Suit yourself , " Scotty said . " Wait till you 've seen Jackson Lake . " In another two hours , we crossed Glade Creek and then the Snake , the main fork that rises in the land of the Shoshone and pours into the swamp above Jackson Lake . Once across the river , we struck a road that had been built by Ben Sheffieldand was in the process of being taken over by eminent domain . Ben had used that road to transport his million-dollarhunters from Moran to a supplementary camp he had set up just south of the boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight south near the bank of the Snake , to Edwards ' Ranch on the edge of the swamp , where Lizard Creek came in . Sim Edwards turned out to be a friend of Hank Bittinger , the rancher we had met in Pocatello , and Sim , who doted on music had been tipped off by Hank , in a letter , that a couple of musicians had left Pocatello , bound for Jackson Lake . When Oscar got in , later , with Larry O'Brien , we had to trot out the violin and I was handed a mandolin , Montgomery Ward S.J. 4-106483 , which Sim had ordered from Chicago in the hope that , with musicians loose in The Hole for the winter , he might learn to play a tune or two . Sim 's favorite was " Under the Bamboo Tree , " probably because bamboo was one of the few trees or grasses he never had seen before it had been varnished and fashioned into curio racks . I wrote out the words of the chorus for Sim and with his cowpuncher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lik'a yew , Like yew lik'a me , And we lik'a both the same . I 'd like to say This very dayI 'd like to change your na-a-ame. "  |p172Playing  that tune on a mandolin , or elsewhere , involves five notes , not far apart , and when Sim 's clumsy fingers could squeeze the sharp strings on the frets and he could pick with the other hand at the same time , he was jubilant . A bright cub bear could have learned it in about the same time , and with less effort . Mrs. Edwards ' mother , who . hated music because it got her " all het up with nowhere to go , " watched the proceedings ill-naturedly . " We 'll never get another lick of work out of Sim , " she said , and threatened to smash the mandolin into stove wood before the cold weather set in . Because the old lady could not get a rise out of Sim , she rode her daughter , Milly ( for Remilda ) all the time we were there , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar played . When we all caught on that we could throw her into spasms of rage by being extra polite , we became Sir Walter Raleighs , all except George , who defended the cantankerous old woman , helped her with the dishes and held her yarn while she rolled it into balls , pretending not to notice when she casually broke wind . Spinoza had already spent a night at Edwards ' Ranch , and had goaded the old lady to the verge of a fit by telling all hands about Rabelais ' mill , which made old women into young ones who were pert and pretty but had only one defect . Their heels were short , so that , according to the Frenchman , whenever a man touched them , be it ever so lightly , they would fall over backwards . After that , whenever there were guests at the ranch , which was every day , that autumn , Sim 's face would light gleefully and his wife , Remilda , seeing the gleam in his eyes , would say : " Now , Sim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a word about that dratted Frenchman 's mill . " Sim , paying no attention , would repeat the story , and all the men , from the raggedest hobo to the college engineers and assorted gentlemen , would express the wish that such a mill could be set up on the edge of that swamp . In extremep173cases , they would swear they had seen a picture of a mill like that in the Monkey Ward book . The old lady had more than once attacked the wayfarers with a warming pan or slop bucket . While we were there , and George 's benign solicitude kept her within bounds , no violence resulted . Old Granny Diles would mutter about Frenchmen and their ways , and insistthat when she was young , back in St. Jo , a Frenchman named Pierre ( she pronounced it Pee-er ) had boarded her up in a backhouse and left her there all night because she would not let him have his will . If there chanced to be no one among the visiting hoboes and mechanics who was of French extraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of them made a playful attempt to waylay Granny Diles by night , on the way to the outhouse , which she patronized twice weekly , and always after dark . The night we were there , Scotty and an electrician rigged up a battery , bored two peepholes into the women 's section of the latrine , and inserted glass marbles , with small lights behind them . From inside , in the dark , when the button was pressed , it looked as if a bob cat was staring and blinking at the occupant . This had to be done without George 's knowledgeor he would have warned the old dame , and disconnectedthe apparatus . The night watchman promised to call us , if Old Granny left her bed that night , but she did not feel the urge and was not thrown into hysterics by glaring feline eyes until a few nights later . Meanwhile , Sim told us afterward , he slept very lightly , and lost a few pounds , because of the suspense . So it becomes clear that the atmosphere and ambience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics and prevailing moods . At Squirrel Meadows , the aesthetic was predominant ; at Cascade , the ignoble or sordid ; while Edwards ' Ranch became known as a Mecca for practical jokers , for a while rivaling in that respect the hotel at Jackson , miles farther down the Snake . At Jackson a fewp174guides from the Park holed in for the winter each year , and kept the local schoolmarm , the preacher and all itinerants in fear of life and limb . Jackson had a new schoolmarm each year , some young woman who had come out from the East in the hope of getting some of the treatment Owen Wister 's Virginian handed out , either with or without benefit of clergy . None was disappointed , even if the guides had to call for help from the Forestry Service nearby . It was at Jackson , in the hotel just mentioned , that the Dilly , with Dot and Roberta , spent that unforgettable season . The next day 's journey to Moran was an easy one , since the going was level , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who were tired of being jolted , left their stuff , if they had any , on the two freighters ' rigs and decided to walk . George , thanking us for our kindness and our company , asked Scotty and me if we would mind if he walked with the others . He wanted to enter camp the hard way , and , of course , we said , " Sure . Go ahead . " From there on we skirted the lakes , the chain and cluster which , with the snowy Tetons , the verdantly forested Grosventres , and the mountain trees , plants and animals , great and small , made Jackson Hole an area beyond the realm of words . In I910 it was remote and unknown , except to bandits , a few inhabitants who liked solitude or made profits from it , and some Grand Dukes , Earls , members of America 's sixty families , and the like . Today the trail over which we bumped and jolted is paved , the region is called Teton National Park , and the shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotogravure sections , have seen photographs of about one and a half of one percent of what we saw that day . Enterprising motion-picture companies have sent actors and extras " on location " and in all corners of the earth that Wyoming scenery has been enjoyed , cluttered up with the said actors , stars , and supernumeraries . I am not sorry . I am glad , but gladder that I got there first , when it wasp175a wilderness . I am glad , too , that the men we helped transportthere were not rich sportsmen , who can go anywhere , or Thespians , to whom one scene is like another if they can have it all by themselves in close-up . I tried to make believe that day that what I was seeing was made up of mere geometrical forms , shapes , contrasts , molecules , colors , conditions of light , chemicals and universal elements . On our right lay the main body of Jackson Lake , until another swamp made us veer to the east and we crossed Pilgrim Creek and sighted on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From there it was only a few miles to Moran , our destination . Our pilgrimage , which had started at Pocatello when the news that the dam had broken came over the wire , through Ashton , and the three road houses , was at an end . Beginning that evening , we were to stay more or less where we were and work until the work was done . We were joining those connected with the outside world only by a long , rough , three-day journey over the divide , and a feeble telephone . We were only sixty miles , by the shortest route , from the branch railroad . By ordinary standards , the distance might as well have been a thousand . Wise met us as we pulled up in front of the tarboard office and walked with us across the field to our cabin near the shore of the lake . Ben Sheffield strolled over from his logcabinpost office attached to the dude ranch , looked at us noncommittally , and acknowledged Wise 's introductions . The cabin Wise and I were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs , chinked with clay on the outside , which had withstood many terrible seasons . There were six small windows , two boarded up . I ripped off one board as we stood there . Sheffield picked it up . The chimney was of brick , both large and substantial . It had to be . Inside was a large room in which some Grand Duke had installed an upright piano , which had cost him a fortune on account of difficulties ofp176transportation . The fireplace was ten feet wide , with a stone slab hearth in five sections . " You can cut your own wood , or buy some from the woodpile , " Ben told us . We said we would think it over . When he suggested that we rent some blankets , we told him we had bought some that would do . He grunted and went back to his post office , in which the next mail was due , via Jackson , the day after next . Scotty 's cabin , which he shared with Bob Sass , Crowe 's brother-in-law , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard were three smaller cabins , built for mere counts or vicepresidents . Torrance was to have the middle one of those . At noon he could walk over from the office in about five minutes , for what the French might call un dejeuner garni . Having left our stuff in the cabins , and enjoyed a drink of Blackstone whiskey , Wise , Scotty and I went back to the office , to look the construction camp over , and be on hand when Oscar rode in with Larry O'Brien and George came marching in with the assorted roughnecks and mechanics . Fritz , the German cook , recognized me and walked over from the mess house to shake hands and say hello . He was neat and clean , a wholesome-looking Teuton giant , all smiles and obsequiousness . He offered to cook us a meal , to tide us over until dinner time , to fry a steak of venison , broil a trout , or whip up a souffle , if we were hungry . We were hungry , all right , but did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much favoritism . So we declined with thanks . To a hobo Fritz would have given his right eye sooner than an extra cup of coffee . From the dam site , two hundred yards distant , I saw a solitaryfigure standing on a cofferdam , outlined against the distantwhite and dark of the Tetons . The slouch hat with narrowbrim , unbuttoned leather vest , high-water pants and long hobnailed boots could not , when composed into that posture , belong to any man except Frank Crowe , engineer.  |p177He  watched what the men on the job were doing , seemed satisfied , then turned and started toward us . When he got nearer , he smiled . " Damn glad you 're here at last , " he said . The way he said it implied that there was lots of work to do , and too few to do it . Before I started for Ashton , it had been understood between Crowe and me that once the rush of freighting and hiring was over at the railroad point , I was to be excused from the snarl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the grade party as instrument man . Scotty would be chief , and we would have our pick of the men in camp who were not essential elsewhere for chainmenand rodmen . Once I caught on how the work , indoors and out , was snowingthe men under , I did not have the heart to hold Crowe to his promise . I worked at surveying by daylight , and helped in the office , either on estimates or computations in the draftingroom , or assembling schedules , bids , contracts and specificationsin the accounting office by night . My first two functions I liked thoroughly , and forced myself to apply all my faculties and alertness to the last . I was not acting in the spirit of a Rover Boy , and had no thought of shaping myself into a self-made man , of which America had considerably too many . I liked Frank Crowe , felt the need of what was to be done , and , in camp just then , there was little else to do besides work . Joe Markham breezed over from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to tell him about George before the latter got in . When that happened , George was cool and collected , too courteous and self-effacing for words , and he insisted on starting work that evening , since Joe was working , too . The problem of seniority solved itself . The bigger shift was working days , another one nights . Joe would be day timekeeper , and George , night timekeeper . George acted quite happy , for a while . His mind proved a good one , his con/science terrific . But the problems which arose in the few weeks he was at the dam site were outside of himself , and he could deal with them objectively . At six o'clock , I had my first meal in the engineers ' mess , after the men of the day shift had eaten theirs in the main mess hall beginning at five-thirty . Crowe sat at the head of the long board table , on a special bench . Wise , Scotty , Joe Markham , Jim McElroy , George , Hunter , Bob Sass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Lower Yellowstone country , Doc Shaw , nurse Johanna Waldron , the slip foreman , master mechanic , and a few others ranged themselves on benches along the sides . Walter , the Iowa flunky , waited on us , with expressive use of his slender hands and long curved eyelashes . By seven-thirty , all of us who could make ourselves useful in the office , and a few who could not , were hard at work . A dam , if it is a good one , is an impressive balanced structurewhich somehow transfers itself from an engineer 's mind , gets official approval , appears first on blueprints , and later is constructed . The second dam at Jackson Lake was to be built of reinforced concrete anchored in bedrock , with flaring abutments at each end from which earth dikes would extend . Twelve steel gates had been ordered and when they arrived , the apertures in the solid concrete would have to be of exact size to fit them . First it was necessary to divert the Snake River , by means of crib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , early in September , so that the original river bed was fairly dry . Centrifugal pumps took care of the seepage , and the excavation was proceeding at high speed . The loose sand and gravel were removed from the top by means of slip scrapers , large sunken boulders were blasted into pieces and lifted by the steam shovel into wagons to be carted away and dumped into the fill of the dikes . In the area where the bedrock was bare , it was being drilled , blasted and removed down to the appropriate level , scrubbedp179clean , grouted wherever it was seamy , and concrete work would start within a few days . Two mixers were on hand and had been placed in position . Cement was stored in the warehouse , each sack examined and samples were molded into briquets and tested for tensile strength . Concrete , as was known to the Romans and probably the Chaldeans , is very strong under compression and rather weak in tension . The reinforcing steel , on the other hand , was strong in tension and weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stresses and strains that neither concrete nor steel could withstand alone . At Jackson Lake , the difficulty was the cold . Ordinarily concrete work is not attempted , unless absolutely necessary , in freezing weather . Each night , even in September , the temperature dipped severaldegrees below the freezing point , ice formed on the pools , and men on the night shift steamed and shivered , alternately . Crowe had planned to build wooden sheds over the separatesections , one by one , heat the inside with steam from the derricks and hoists , place the concrete and keep it warm enough , but not too warm , until it had firmly set . After that , the frost could do its worst without weakening the structure . About six-thirty , Wise and I rose from our beds in our cabin , built a fire in the fireplace , thawed out the ice in the water bucket , washed , dressed , and started over to have breakfast . But we accomplished that routine in widely different ways and degrees of discomfort . Wise was not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that awakening him seemed almost inhuman , and when he left the shelter of his blankets  --  there were so many on his bed that I never counted them  --  he turned a shade of mauve , his long bones rattled in their sockets , his pale eyes watered , his teeth chattered , his hands shook and he gazed at me reproachfully . For I had been conditioned to cold at an early age in New England , had survived a winter on the Lower Yellowstone with/out permanent damage to my deceptively resistant physique , and by the time I had slipped on my socks  --  Wise wore his all night  --  and touched off the kindling , I felt gay and more or less normal , a state poor Wise did not achieve until he was safe in the overheated mess house with about a quart of hot coffee inside him . Wise loved whiskey , but he did not drink it in the morning , not because of any fear of becoming a drunkard , or fluffing his complicated work , but because he had a theory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spinoza . Wise reasoned thus . Early mornings were inherentlyfrightful , and if he deceived his own mind by the use of stimulants and made the ordeal seem less cruel than it was , he would lose his fine adjustment to reality , become whimsicalor just plain silly , and dull his relish of the evening . He may have been right . I refrained from taking a morning snort of Blackstone because whiskey made work seem like work , and not a sort of glorified play . At eight o'clock the whistle of the steam shovel blew , the muckers began shoveling , the skinners started up their horses to drag the slips around , the hard-rock men , those who held drills sitting on gunnysacks to keep from freezing to the bed of the Snake , began their poetry of motion . Machines chugged and spluttered , pumps sloshed and gurgled , and the members of the surveying party set up the level or the transit  --  orat least , I did , since that was my job  --  and we drove stakes with tacks in them to indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how high it should be piled on the dikes and waste banks , where the wooden forms for the concrete should be built , and Scotty made notes from which Torrance and his crew in the drafting room could compute the yardage and estimate progress . One morning I had to set up the transit on a twelve-bytwelvetimber extending from the cofferdam over the bedrockwhich had been bared , about twenty-five feet below . Scotty , never the one to avoid taking risks , stood on the oppo/site side of the instrument and helped me adjust the screws . The weather was not cold enough for mittens , so we wore cottongloves which we flipped off while we were handling the set-screws or balancing the spirit levels . When we thought the instrument was o.k. , Scotty backed away , faced about on the timber , and held a plumb bob within my line of vision through the telescope . By means of hand signals , I indicated the direction in which he should move until the vertical hair coincided with the plumb-bob string . Preston , the young redhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotty set the tack exactly , and , just as the operation was finished and I was free to move my instrument I made the mistake of glancing down past the edge of the timber to the hard rock below . What happened I can not say , except that suddenly I found I could not move hand or foot , or anything else I had except , possibly , my bowels . I was too deep in my trance to speak or explain and when the others saw me standing there , while they were moving on , someone suggested that I remove the lead from my anatomy so that we could finish the job before noon . I was aware that the air , which had been cold , was only cool , and the slanting morning sun was hot . I knew , somewhere in the back of my head , that it would be better to speak than remain silent , and I was almost sure what I should say , but no words came . It was the Scot who tumbled to my predicament , and he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the timber , approaching me from behind . I felt his hands under my elbows , and heard his voice telling me to step hack with one foot , then the other . On the top of the cofferdam , in comparative safety , I slowly sat down , and then Scotty had his laugh , and so , I regret to say , did all my pals on the surveyingparty , the foremen , mechanics and about half the men on the day shift , until the dam-site din was augmented by such a raucous roar that Crowe glanced over from a distance . That troubled me , because I did not want to show any unfit/ness in his presence or lose my prize assignment . Scotty , the sensitive , caught on , told me to get up , then walked over deliberately to the stake we had just set and in a way that seemed accidental knocked it askew . " Go on back there , " Scotty said , and I stepped out on the timber . When I started , I was shaky and afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to readjust the transit I was angry . The muckers , skinners and mechanics were grinning , and the hard-rock men were making bets with coins , the outcome of which , I realized , depended on me . " Jaime , you thick-headed bugger , " I yelled without openingmy mouth too wide . " Five dollars that I make it . " Jaime nodded , and a few minutes later , he paid . I did not thank Scotty , or comment further on the incident , but I knew , and so did all the men who had been giddy on high places , that had I postponed the second setup a few minutes longer , my usefulness as a transitman on that particular dam job would fade . Of course , there were other jobs I could do , and I thought most highly of my carcass . But in spite of my rational scorn of competitive gestures and instincts , at that age I found it humiliating to start anything without finishing it . Naturally , in the course of years , I have modified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advice of a fine old Frenchman who , when dying , urged his young relativesgathered around the bedside " to stay where they were if they were content , and move on if they were bored or uncomfortable . "  |p183Before  the great wars caught up with us , and luck became synonymous with self-preservation , the American West was saturated with luck , in the air , the sweeping storms , the gold strikes , oil gushers , on the range , in the forest , over mountain and plain . When it became apparent that a man felt unlucky , and divinely abused , Westerners looked askance at him , and knew that he was very ill , long before Freud and his camp followers hit Idaho . I will tell you about that in another book , because Sigmund the Great spilled his prose as far as Boise in 1912 , and the city became dream-conscious in cornerswhere previously the only consideration that had matteredwas whether they were wet or dry . In late September , another consignment of men and horses came into The Hole from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Southerner named Waite . Whether Waite 's father had fought and bled was never established , but it was generally agreed that if he had , and his son was like him , the South had done well to hold out as long as it had . Waite never murdered anyone , or got into fights , but his dealings with others all seemed to , result in his favor , although the sum total , according to him , left him perpetually broke . He was broke when he hit Jackson Lake , but who was not ? What did it matter ? To Waite it mattered enormously . He had brought with him an extra saddle mare named Star , of whichp184he protested that he was very fond , and so he had hoped to sell her , in order that his fondness would not soften his nature and reduce his shrewdness as a trader who left sentimentbehind when he heard the rattle of coins . Star was a small trim bay , with one white foot and a white star on her forehead , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift , gentle and sound in every way . Had anyone else other than Waite owned her , no one would have doubted her desirability and value . As it was , Waite could not find a man in camp who would risk buying her for cash . Undaunted , Waite thought of a way he could dispose of her at a higher profit than he could expect from an auction . He organized a raffle , with 200 tickets , numbered from i to 200 . Each buyer was to pay one cent for each unit in his number , thus the men who drew No. i would pay one cent ; I , who drew 32 , paid thirty-two cents ; and the Basque who drew 200 paid $2.00 . Of course , none of us would consent to have Waite any nearer the hat into which the numbers had been folded and dumped than about three yards , and the search for an honest man , whom everyone would trust , proved embarrassing . Crowe was the only possible choice , and he , as boss of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which might or might not run contrary to federal , state or county laws against gambling . Finally , someone suggested Sooner Kulmus , the wife of the skinner from Montanawho had been allowed to keep house within the governmentright of way . The foreigners acquiesced out of chivalry , and the " white men " agreed that any woman with a face like Sooner 's would have to be honest in order to bring it outdoorson pleasant days . Sooner had a swayback , one lopsided hip , a mouth that extended practically from ear to ear , cow eyes and a dim moustache . Four men had practically to drag her from her shack past the blacksmith shop to the office , where the raffle was decided . She simpered , tried to hide her mouth with both hands ,  |p185broke  into a cold sweat , stammered and sashayed before she could be brought up to the hat full of tickets . It would have been easier to lead the mare , Star , who was hitched and blanketedjust outside , to a basket filled with rattle snakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hat and came out with a folded number , but she was so excited that she had to wait a few minutes and dry her eyes before she could read the figures on it . " Thirty-two , " she finally yelled , and ran out of the office , yelping . Her husband watched the proceedings laconically , indifferent to the crude remarks the roughnecks addressed to his ungainlymate . Meanwhile , it dawned on me slowly that I had won a mare . Scotty , who knew all about horseflesh , technically , looked at her teeth and said she was four years old . Waite had said three , but that did not matter . I led Star away from the crowd and she followed with docility . I had to get permissionfrom Crowe to stable her in the government stable , to buy oats and hay ; and a suitable saddle , currycomb , bridle , halter , sets of special shoes , and standard lotions and linimentshad to be ordered by phone from Ashton . Meanwhile Waite rented me a saddle for four bits a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us could spend evenings at Edwards ' Ranch , the Lakeview ranch , or Sargent 's , to the north , and ride to Jackson and back , got the fever , and decided we should have another horse , so both of us could roam until the winter closed in . After that , we could travel  --  and much faster  --  on skis , with which we had become proficient but not fancy on the Lower Yellowstone . So he had the stable boss condemn Prince , on account of an imaginaryattack of heaves and , after yards of red tape had been cut , became the owner of the chestnut gelding . Again Crowe preferrednot to notice what we were doing , ex officio . Ben Sheffield , whom Oscar had christened " Haddock Face , " and a few of the old timers around The Hole , however , looked onp186quizzically , knowing that , on account of the snow , we would be lucky to be able to ride the horses a fortnight after our elaborate preparations were completed . My first ride , I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the fact that I was the party who was supposed to look after her and although she never was affectionate , she was not the demanding type . No one else was allowed to feed , curry her , or clean her stall and if I was late for a feeding or early for a currying , which she pretended to resent , she let me know her displeasure by stepping on my foot , in a seemingly accidental way , or brushing my face with her long and wiry tail . The day after I won her , Crowe asked me to ride down to Edwards ' Ranch and ask Sim on what section of the road the first snow was likely to fall . Ben Sheffield , who was usually right but so unpleasant no one liked to trust him , had said that the slopes just east of the divide , between Squirrel Meadows and Cascade , were sure to be covered , maybe two feet deep , before winter 's white blanket would be spread over The Hole . Ben said , too , that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fantastic cold . Ben would have liked to watch our whole crew freeze to death , and see the job abandoned . It was a relief , as I rode northward , to have the lake and the Tetons at my back for a while , because , while working around the dam site or walking around the camp , whenever my attention had not been focused elsewhere I looked at the matchless " view , " Mount Moran , the Grand Teton and the lesser peaks , with snow above the timber line , high clouds streaking the dark forest below , the reflections of the mountainsin the water , the high rugged whiteness , the green almost black , the blue horizontal , the rowboats on the shore . I had gone fishing several times , and caught what was needed , but as I had rowed nearer the Tetons , and farther from all else , I had felt as if I were intruding on a giant stage set , deserted but private and forbidden . The Shoshone Indiansp187had been afraid to enter the region called Yellowstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct or awe such as I experienced on Jackson Lake , and only after their enemieshad chased them into the area of colored hot mud and geysers did the Shoshones discover that the great and small Spirits were indifferent to their presence . Since other Indians still were afraid to come in and slaughter the Shoshones , the latter found the weird volcanic region was a refuge , and lost what warlike qualities they had , which never were of the highest order . They degenerated into peace-loving tranquil citizens and put up no resistance when the white men came along . I skirted the high mountain swamp near the head of the lake , after passing the lesser lakes on my right , and wondered what Sim would say when I asked him about the winter . Crowe had suggested that I talk with as many of the old timers as I could , without letting on that the information they might pass out was for official use and government plans , and , if there was a consensus about the severity or mildness of the season , to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly and as frank as a practical joker could be , on account of my slight command of the mandolin which Sim mistook for virtuosity , I preferred to ask him my questionsfirst , and made no mention of them when I overtook a couple of ranch hands from Sargent 's outfit . They had rifles , and I assumed that they were about to shoot some elks , in order to sell the meat to Fritz , our cook , who would accept it as beef . I was sure that Fritz was collecting a rakeoff from all the ranchers in that part of The Hole , but I would not suggestsuch a thing to Crowe for various reasons . First of all , Fritz fed us beyond all reasonable expectations in a constructioncamp . Secondly , the elks feloniously but instantly shot and palmed off as steer meat were likely to die anyway , slowly and with anguish in the winter , if the snowfall was heavy . Thirdly , Crowe was no chump and probably knew morep188about the graft than I did , in which case he preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A mile from Edwards ' Ranch , I saw what looked like a legendary figure , Old Goody Twoshoes , on her hands and knees beneath a huge tree , gathering pine cones and droppingthem into an Indian basket . It was Old Granny Diles , who pretended not to notice my approach until I nearly rode her down , which caused her to spring up spryly , just in time , and make a pass at Star 's face with the Indian basket . The mare paid little attention ; she was that well trained . Had I actually steered her over Granny , she would have obeyed my indications . Hers not to reason why . " Too bad you did n't break your neck , " she said , in lieu of a conventional greeting . " What you doing ? " I asked . " Stealing pine nuts ? " " I 'll steal you , you fathead , on the other side of your mouth . And do n't you go tellin ' Sim no more about pickin ' that strung-up wooden thunder mug ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus knows we 'll need it , " Granny said . " Hard winter , you mean ? " " They 're all hard , in this Godforsaken country . I should'a stayed in Missouri and got ruined by that damn Frenchman . He was so mad he nailed me in the lulu , by God . " " You told me about that a dozen times already , " I said , to draw her out . " Supposin ' I did . You 've got plenty of time . I never yet saw you do a tap of work for your Government pay . For all I know , you stole that ornery mare you 're on . " " Want a ride ? " I asked . " I 'd like to see her kick the daylightsout of you . " " No , thanks ! I 'm in a hurry , " Granny said , and , tucking her basket under her arm , set out for the ranch , banging her heels down hard to let out her spite . As she walked she mutteredabout me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and how Milly , if she had any gumption , would drill Simp189right through with a hatpin if he would not come up to scratch and justify his existence . I let her get a start , then caught up with her and kept Star alongside . " How come Sim and Milly have n't any kids ? " I asked . " Did you strangle ' em at birth ? " " I would have , if he 'd been man enough to get one , " Granny said . " You only had one yourself , " I said . " Anybody can get caught and have to go through it once . It takes a prize damn fool to do it again . That smart aleck from Squirrel Meadows " ( Spinoza ) " says I 'm a Neo-Mal . . . folderol , and by God , I am . " " A Neo-Malthusian , " I suggested . " Commend me to a government young punk to rattle off long words , " she said . " What do they do , up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You all must get in each other 's way . " " There 's a lot of crows up there , " I said . " Why do n't youcome up and scare ' em ? You might even get paid . " Granny , warmed by the abuse , got chummy for a while . " The crows around the ranch flew south already , " Grannysaid , eyeing me balefully . " Is that bad ? " I asked . " It means we 'll have fifteen feet of snow . That 's what it means . " I made my mental note . She walked and I rode along in silence for a while , but not long . " If I was Milly , I 'd tangle with every man that stayed all night at the ranch , to get Sim mad . I 'd show him it was n't my fault they have to hire all their help . " " I 'm sure he tries his best , " I said . Sim heard our voices and , tossing down his axe for the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get the little mare ? " he asked , for he had ap190great eye for horseflesh , and assumed that such a superior specimen as Star would not have been sold to the government . " Saddle up a horse , " I suggested . " So we can take a ride , and talk things over . " " Sure . We can play later . I got the start of Red Wing , ' but she throws me somewhere in the middle . " " Red Wing " had ten different notes in it , exactly twice as many as " Under the Bamboo Tree , " so I was not surprised that Sim could not make it . Sim and I rode across the swamp , on a trail Sim knew and not many others could find , forded the Snake , and went up the slope of a high hill near where Berry Creek ran into Webb Canyon , and , once I had told Sim why I had come , he pointed out the signs . Every one of them meant a hard , hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boring high on the trunks of the trees . As Granny had said , the crows had flown south , and the meadow larks were flocking for an early migration . The husks around the nuts were extra thick . Also , Sim said he felt winter in his bones already . The surest test was reserved for supper time that night , and threw Granny Diles into a rage which surmounted the minor spasms she had suffered all day . According to Sim , the surest way to find out about an oncoming winter is to kill a goose , roast her in a slow oven , and , after eating roast goose , to examine the breast bone . If it is thick and spotted , the winter will be terrific . If the bone is thin and clear , the season will be mild . " No , siree , " Sim said . " That goose bone never lies . " The catch was that one of our freighters had got in with a load of men , quite noticeably less promising and gallant than the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting the Edwardses , to be fed , and that meant at least four geese . Granny Diles had raised only four that year , and was saving them for Thanksgiving . Sim , his family and Ip191could have sat at a separate table , but Sim got his dander up and said that , by the living Jesus and all the cockeyed apostles , no man would come into his house and eat different than he did , or at least , no worse . While Old Granny screamed and shouted maledictions , and made passes with pitchforks and carving knives until she had to be subdued and roped into her rocking chair , Sim and the pale tremulous Milly killed four geese , one after another , stripped them of their feathers which were saved for pillow stuffing , plucked their pin feathers , singed them , stuffed them and trussed them , and Sim turned Granny loose after they were safely in the oven . Granny cursed and cried , but when the old kitchen and the ranch house began to smell of roasting fowl , she perked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party as if nothing had happened . She was enormously cheered when I told her that Sim would be on the government payroll most of the winter . In the course of our ride in search of portents and omens , Sim had accepted Crowe 's offer , which I transmitted , that Sim take charge of the road gang once the snow fell and keep the road open as long and as often as possible . The gates for the dam , without which not much work could proceed after December , had not been shipped from Indiana , although the manufacturers were rushing the order as fast as they could . If the snow got too deep before the heavy gates got over the road , Crowe 's plans were sunk . Just before supper was announced by the banging of the gong , and men who had not tasted roast goose in years were feeling anticipatory droolings in their mouths and churnings in their tripes , a laborer I had noticed especially at Ashton , around the freight depot , blew in , having passed up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dam site . He was on the payroll as J. Smith , and I had happened to see him cutting a small item from the Boise Statesman to the effect that a man named Joel Sammon ( note the initials " J.S. " ) was being sought by the city and country authorities , as an " amnesia " case . Please do not imagine , those of you who started reading within the past twenty years or less , that amnesia was not known to the ancients of the early 1900 's , and was not practicedeven more assiduously before radio and TV and **25;7562;TOOLONG with police of various communities and government agencies like the F.B.I . and T-men helped coordinate them , however ineptly . In the case of Joel Sammon , or J. Smith , I had been overzealous , or inconsiderately curious , as young men were and are likely to be . When his surreptitious act of clipping a copy of the Statesman had called my attention to him , I had talked with Doc Shaw about him , and amnesia , and we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try some tests . Doc had been too busy , up to the evening in question , to try anything much concerning the possible fugitive from in-laws , dependents and lack of specialtraining which would enable him to feed the sixteen . Neither Doc nor I had the slightest intention of givingthe man away , whatever we found out . Any man with sixteen dependents , half of which have moved in on him from his wife 's side of the family and are not his flesh and blood , was entitled as far as I was concerned to walk out on the whole kit and boodle of them any time he liked . Within reasonable limits , I felt strongly that any man , whatever his circumstances , had an inalienable right to beat it , when things got too much for him , on the assumption that the Heavenly Father who provided for earwigs and thistles would take up the new responsibilities and master them . Unknown to me , a few days before Doc had found some time on his hands while I had been with Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookshack to ask Fritz if " Joel had left any salmon . " Doc waited a long time for J. Smith to return , but the latter , instead of going to the messp193house and asking Fritz the question , had beat it to the office , collected what was coming , and started on foot , presumably for Ashton , via Edwards ' Ranch . " Hello , Smith , " I said , when J. S. came into the mess at Edwards ' place . He grunted , and looked furtive , also mad . " What 's wrong ? Do n't you like your job ? " I continued . " What 's it to you , if I quit ? A man can quit , " he said . I thought probably he had decided to go back to Boise , relieve his wife 's anxiety , and possibly share his earnings with the sixteen dependents . Or he might kick out his brother-inlawand his wife 's sister , and reduce the burden to fourteen dependents . J. S. did not look like a man who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but one could never tell . Before the table was set , Sim came in , took out his sixshooterand laid it on the bench . He had been chopping wood , riding horseback , wrestling with the tough Old Granny , killing and preparing geese and struggling with the mandolin that day . " I 'm tired , " Sim said . To our horror , J. S. said , " So am I , " picked up the revolver , and shot himself in the head . He was dead before he fell , and I lost my appetite for goose , almost . We laid him out in the woodshed , under the cynical eyes of the assembled bums . Granny was yelling that " she did n't blame him , " and defendingthe impetuous act . Sim and I drank whiskey , and sat down to the geese with the others . Sim 's conscience was clear , and mine was not . I had meddled again , with a fatal result . Would I never learn to mind my own business , and none other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suffered with J. S. and thought of him resting in Jackson Hole , where lots of men have died and not all were buried . I have tried to believe he was not Joel Sammon , although Joel was never heard from again and his wife got married , a year later , to anp194ex-cop who beat her and the kids and manhandled on sight all the relatives who got within range . Supposing I had not felt the urge to go into the Ashton latrine just when I did , or to rubberneck into that copy of The Statesman . It had not been necessary for me to pry , and tell Doc Shaw , or to weld any of the links in the chain that were fatal to J. S. before supper time that night . At least , he might have had his fill of goose  --  whose breast bone was thick , tough and conspicuouslyspotted . His hunger was not for food , but liberty . I have asked his pardon a million times , and I ask it now . J. S. ! Forgive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to get around and did not know what he was doing.  |p195How  does cold creep into the mountains ? Our lake was a mile above sea level . Mount Moran with its perpetually moving glacier , the sharp Grand Teton , and the lesser peaks formed a ridge which cut off the weather from the west , where the effect of the Japanese current and the rolling Pacific was warm , so they said . To the east the wooded Grosventres shielded The Hole from the winds from that direction . Elk Island , in the lake , broke the sweep of local tempests that hatched in our natural enclosure . We noticed that it took longer to work up a sweat in the mornings , as we set stakes and measured progress at the dam site . The sheets of ice on pools got thicker and lasted through the day . The waters near the shores of the lake were frozen each night . Still , the sun persisted , and what we had to fear from snow and cold was lessened by the unlikelihood of strong winds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I found it an excellent rule . Either natives of any section of our country are resentful when others intrude , or they have a submerged hatred of the land that nourishes them , or they try to defend it against all criticism , in advance . Sim Edwards , who told me most about what we might expect , was from Iowa , so what he said about Wyoming was mostly valid . One of the guides from Jackson came into camp one dayp196with a cloth around his head , under his Stetson hat , and a long gash in his scalp . He was sheepish in approaching Doc Shaw , to get himself sewed up , and only under pressure and the influence of smooth whiskey admitted that he had tried to crash Dot 's room one night and had been laid out cold by the Dilly , who crowned him with a heavy crockery wash bowl . " I had it coming , " said the guide , who bore the Dilly no resentment . " But , damn it all , it 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old maid around , where he can see ' em and smell ' em , and all the time he knows they ai n't being good on principle , but are saving themselves for some government man . " Dot , as a matter of fact , had been one hundred percent chaste , as far as men were concerned , and Roberta was for Scotty , for the time being , and would not have cheated if all the Grand Dukes and millionaires in Europe and New York had tried to change her practice . Bobbie was a one-man woman , that is , one man at a time . So Scotty , after the eveningswe spent in Jackson , walked around with a smile on his face that seemed to reflect a clear conscience and actually was generated by what some purists might classify as guilt . All I could say to myself was that if Scotty took as long making love to a girl as he did setting up a transit or harnessing a team of horses , she would have time to go through two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to WilliamTell in the bargain . Roberta , however , did not complain . " I love you , you redheaded bastard , " she would say to Scotty . " But I wo n't hold it against you , and when you get ready to quit , give me the soldier 's farewell . " Another night she said : " You 're the first guy I 've met whotreated me as well after as before , and did n't take my moneyor my duds . I do n't want to marry you , or play any dirty tricklike that , but as long as you like me , just let me stick around . " The Dilly and Roberta were pals , just about the way Scottyp197and I were friends , understanding much with little said , and allied to the limit , in either case the sky . Dot and the Dilly fought like a couple of wildcats in a sack , slung over a clothesline , and when they made up they were as mild as two doves on a church eave . Three sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by late October , and the gates had not been shipped . On Sunday mornings , I , the early riser , would get out of bed quietly , so Wise could sleep till ten . I would take my .32 Special , go into the woods at the rim of the lake on the eastern side , and when I found a tree in which grouse were roosting or feeding , I would lie down , take plenty of aim , and shoot the bottom one first , through the head . If one shot the top one , the commotion it would make falling down through leaves and branches would cause the rest to fly a hundred yards or so . They had not been shot at , before , and were that tame . When I had a half-dozen grouse , I would take them to Torrance'scabin , Dawn would stuff and roast them , and we would have a late Sunday-morning breakfast  --  Wise , Torrance , Scotty , Doc Shaw , and I , with two or three other guests . Oscar , who was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hard , and would drop in for his grouse at noon . Or I would row out on the lake and catch some salmon trout , which swam near the surface , or a couple of big Mackinawswhich lived in the depths . Neither species would co-operate , exactly . The salmon trout fought high ; the Mackinaws would get the line into a snag at the bottom , if they could . But I never thought of fishing , there , as a blood-curdling contest . One had simply to bait the hook , wait a few moments , let the fish wear itself out , and haul it in . Evenings we would gather in our cabin , for music and talk and whiskey , not to mention cards , cigars and correspon/dence . About one or two o'clock we would disperse and go to bed . One Sunday the phone rang in the office . Sim was on the line . " We 've got a foot of snow , from the summit to Cascade , " he said . Before Scotty and I got down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snow had fallen . The sky over Jackson Lake was gray and sullen , and that night the snow fell over the camp , the dam site and our end of the basin . Jackson reported a foot of snow . At Squirrel Meadows , on the other hand , a few fool meadow larks that had not joined the others in the early migration were singing and the Idaho side of the slope was warm , like Indian summer . That evening , as we did about twice a week , the gang went up to Crowe 's cabin , high on the slope of the Grosventre mountain he had chosen . His wife , Barbara , made candy and served coffee . Oscar and I played , including " Red Wing " four or five times at Crowe 's request , and one by one the boys danced with Mrs. Crowe , in a space about six feet square . She was a strong-looking girl with red cheeks and a wonderful complexion , a hearty voice , and a disposition free from guile . We talked about everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us thought about the gates and the snow , and Crowe got restless , now and then , and would pace back and forth outside . He was on the way to success , with his first important job , and only the lack of gates could stop him . Doc Shaw would sing , either Schubert , Robert Franz , Schumannor Brahms , unless someone asked him for a popular song , in which case he cheerfully complied . Barbara Crowe would wait patiently for " The Heart Bowed Down " and " Then You 'll Remember Me . " The high spot for her was " Just a Song at Twilight . " While we were playing that number , and Doc was singing , she would sit in her wooden chair with arms , made by Abe Johnson for her comfort . Her eyesp199would shine , her cheeks would glow , and all of us would watch her , unobtrusively , and wonder what it would be like to have a cabin on the hillside , and a strong young woman , for richer or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to none of us just then . Dawn Torrance and Norman would join us at Crowe 's , now and then , and once in a while Barbara would call on Dawn in the afternoon . Infrequently , Barbara and Dawn would walk over to the shack behind the blacksmith shop and call on Sooner , who would be so flustered that she would burn her husband 's dinner , and her yelping and gurgling would resound between the Tetons and the Grosventres and start lurid notions in the minds of mechanics and bums , which got them nowhere at all . Barbara Crowe never got close to Dawn , really , and Dawn felt distinct from Barbara . Neither of them thought of Sooner as a woman like herself . They all were different , remote from one another , and they could not be added , successfully , any more than a pear , an apple and a turnip could be resolved into a sum . There were three bunkhouses , one for foremen , sub-foremen , riggers , carpenters , and mechanics ; another for Americanmuckers and skinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bulgarians , Montenegrins , Herzegovinians , Bosnians , Austrians , and one stray Greek . The Swedes , Norwegians , and a couple of Danes were classed as " white men " and lived with the Americans . So did the half-dozen Frenchmen , a few Limeys and some Canadians . Only six men , among our three hundred , quit the job when the news got around that part of the road was blocked with snow . But that stretch which got the first snowfall was open before Monday morning , and the freighters went through on wheels . A freight-car load of pungs , with two sets of runners , got into Ashton and they were shipped in small lots to SquirrelMeadows , Cascade , Edwards ' Ranch and Moran . The men worked faster , in the cold , and Crowe , much worried aboutp200those gates , put on a graveyard shift , so all through the days and nights the excavation , the fill , the rock and concrete work went on and the new dam was taking shape before our eyes . We awoke one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then smoke , and a gang of foresters , ranchers and guides blew in from Jackson way and asked for help . A forest fire had got started , just over the nearest Grosventres , and was sweeping our way , out of control . Crowe rode over to look at it , rode back at a gallop , the whistle blew untimely , Hunter and the foremen gathered round , and all hands except a small skeleton crew were sent to fight the fire . Those of you who have seen a forest fire in the movies have felt sick and somewhat excited , but in a theatre there is no rasping of smoke in the nostrils and throat , no swarms of animals , from the smallest chipmunks to the cumbersome moose fleeing dumbly for their lives , no glare and running flames in companies and battalions , no rumble of black powder and dynamite , no futile back fires , no Doc Shaw riding back and forth to treat the burns , no bums , Bohunks , mechanics and citizens , each one of whom one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of passing hours , and limits to men 's endurance , then Crowe and Hunter and Bob Sass , Scotty McVeigh ( always calm and useful ) and your author , too young and not too useful , although surcharged with good will , took charge of separate gangs , and saw to it that men slept , when they could no longer keep on their feet and dodge the falling flaming trees . I saw Crowe , his slouch hat , his pale blue eyes , his cheekbonessmeared with soot , his stout boots , high-water pants , stand apart and stare at the preposterous new enemy , and saw him watch the camp go up in smoke , perhaps , and all the machinery lost and the new dam impossibilized , and try to figure what to do . Men worked like mad , who had seldom cared a damn aboutp201anything . It was a challenge , an outrage , and such a waste of trees , fauna , flora , acres , miles . One would not have thought the world could produce so much smoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gray , blue-black smoke , such smell of burning pitch and pine . But after three days and three nights that seemed to have no end , the gray sky did its part , the wind shifted , snow fell and sizzled , and the fire was stopped two mountains short of the edge of Jackson Lake , and although fifty men stayed on and worked for a week , putting it completely out , two hundred went back to the dam , aged by the experience . Two feet of snow fell at Cascade and Edwards ' Ranch , three feet at the summit of our road , our telephone line went out of commission , the pungs were put in use , and Sim doubled his gang . " Dear Elliot , " began a letter from Elizabeth : " I think of you often , and sometimes wonder why I feel such firmness in our friendship although we met under rather odd circumstances , were not alone together , and may not meet again . " To write those last words caused me actual pain . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to believe it and once in a while do not because I am too anxious . I look forward to our first real talk , and to sitting across a table from you , listening to some Chinese music . Will you dislike it , as nearly everybody does , or . . . I think you will not , and I am too anxious about that , too . " Without meaning to , you have profoundly disturbed me , and I can feel , in reading your letters , that I have confused your mind , having had no such intention . Are you sorry or glad ? I am glad . In work such as I have to do , explaining China to Chinese , and freedom , responsiblity , and work for freedom to Chinese who are in separate groups and must be won over for Sun Wen , I had thought one should not havep202too much of a personal life , but now that I have one , I think it is helpful and right . We want to make China better , for everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please them , and fewer be weighed down with frustration and abuse . So , if I have a personal life and find it good , I am settingan example , am I not ? " Dear Elliot . Write me anything you want to , and do not hold back too much . Or am I foolish and too quick at imaginingthings . This Chinese character means love . ' You may copy it , if you wish . But there should be a character for a mixture of Chinese and Texas kinds of love , and your Boston kind , too , if you have it , and I hope you do . " Elizabeth . " That night , Crowe could have his Barbara , Kulmus his Sooner , Wise his Emily , Sim his Milly , Norman his Dawn , Scotty his Bobbie , and the Dilly her Dot , for all I cared . I had someone waiting in Boise , and a personal spring ahead . I had a revolutionary cause , which was producing effect . On Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays I watched for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Our mail , from east or west , was delivered at St. Anthony by the mail clerks who rode the Oregon Short Line , was hauled by wagon over the long St. Anthony-Jackson road and the old pass 10,000 feet high . The Mormon had a contract with the Governmentand there had not been time to make new arrangementswhich would take advantage of our sixty-mile road from Ashton . Ben Sheffield hated foreigners who worked for wages , so he accepted my help , rather sullenly , in sorting and delivering the Bohunks ' mail . In turn , I asked the aid of Steve Dimitrios , our only Greek , who turned out to be half Turk , and a formidable linguist . He could struggle along in German , Bulgarian , French , and all the Balkan dialects , and back in what he called " The Old Country , " meaning Athens , he hadp203worked while still in his teens for Thomas Cook and Sons . From what he told me in his broken English , his work had consisted mostly in steering tourists to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police . The staid old travel agency had listed Steve as an " errand boy " and neither Steve 's employers nor his clients knew exactly what was going on , most of the time . I could never understand where Crowe got his notions about workers of various nationalities . He swore by his Spanishriggers and hard-rock men , believed that no one could swing a short-handled shovel and wear rubber boots in icy water and slush as well as a Bulgarian . Austrians he tolerated , without ever catching on that putting them in the same bunkhousewith Montenegrins , Herzigovians , or Bosnians was like caging game cocks with ordinary roosters . Because of some unfortunate experience on the Yellowstone , he would not have an Italian around camp , and the smarter a Greek was , the more Crowe distrusted him . Steve Dimitrios was very smart . Crowe had fired him twice already , hoping to get him out of The Hole before the roads were blocked , but Doc Shaw , who had to depend on Steve as interpreter , when certainkinds of Bohunks got hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit that Doc was right . " If I start boring for a man 's appendix when he 's trying to tell me about indigestion , " Doc said to Crowe , " he 'll sue the pants off the government , and he 'll be right . " Doc was as fluent in German as in English , and knew college French . The Balkan languages were too much for him , and no wonder . In the center of the milling crowd around the post-office window , Wise hovered like a long-legged sandhill crane , and his appetite in the mess house and zest for punishment in the office were tempered by the length and thickness of the lettershe got from Emily . He wrote about twelve or fifteen pages to her every day , and while she replied quite faithfully , herp204own offerings seldom ran beyond four or five pages . She was not articulate or subtle with a pen , and because she started each letter with the intention of confessing her love for Oscar , to whom she never wrote , and ended by postponing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be interpreted in the glow of Wise 's own enthusiasm , which was a strain on him . The Dilly wrote Spinoza at least twice a week , and he never showed anyone her letters , although if there were news items included , he communicated them to us conscientiously , over the telephone . I had realized from the first that my mare , Star , was exceptionallysure-footed , almost like a little donkey when she had to take me over a dangerous narrow trail , up high , find a trail through the swamp , or follow the tricky stones , both smooth and sharp , in a dry creek bed . The first time I rode her over a packed snow road made treacherous by a fresh snowfall on top , I knew I had a wonderful snow horse . So did Scotty , Sim and , finally , Frank Crowe . So when we got word that the first pair of gates were in Ashton , some days after the heavy snowfallnear Cascade and the big forest fire just east of us , Crowe sent me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ride ahead of his team over the worst section of the road , to keep the precious gates moving and intact . Our versatilehead blacksmith fashioned me a special pair of stirrups big enough so that I could wear felt overshoes and several pairs of woolen socks inside them . That way I could keep my feet from getting too badly frost-bitten , and when a man can keep his feet unfrozen , the rest of his body will take care of itself , more or less . Once or twice each hour , as I rode ahead of the gates , little Star would slip and go almost out of sight in the deep snow , with me on her back . She was patient , trusting and intelligent , and would lie panting and sometimes half-suffocating until Larry and the extra men Sim had on the pung got us back on the roadbed . Had the pung slipped into the drift , with the gates , the delay wouldp205have been more serious . As it was , proceeding about a mile an hour , we got them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ranch . From there to the dam the going was easier . Before the first of November , eight of the twelve gates were safe in Moran , but the snow kept falling , and we could see it would be a tossup whether we were able to haul in the last four , or the road would be impassable for an animal with shorter legs than a giraffe 's . Whenever I had to be away from the main camp too many days at a time , I was nervous for fear my helper , Steve , would get himself fired for keeps in my absence . For he had attacked the postmaster , Ben Sheffield , for accusing him of stealing from registered packages , and Crowe had had to threaten Ben with being thrown into the lake , through a hole in the ice , if Ben persisted in his refusal to let Steve enter the post office . While the St. Anthony-Jackson pass was still open , we got alarming news from Fred McMinniman in Pocatello . He wrote us that Miss Chamberlain , the formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brady and had told him that the woman with the hat who was suspectedof having helped the two girls escape from the reform school was in Jackson . Miss Chamberlain had announced her intention of making the hazardous trip over the pass to see for herself if the Hat Woman and the fugitives were together . So one night , Scotty and I got out our skis and made the trip to Jackson , over the snow and by moonlight . The guide , Jocko Phipps , who had been crowned by the Dilly and afterwardhad developed into her staunchest protector , and another guide who was suffering from an ailment that made it most unlikely that he would be able to carry out any dishonorableattentions to the women for quite some time , agreed to take the Dilly , Roberta and Dot the Dip by an overlandtrail that could be followed by experts , with sleds , skis and snowshoes , over to Livingstone , Montana , where thep206Dilly and her protegees could get aboard the N.P. and ride to St. Paul for the rest of the winter . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discourage Miss Chamberlain on the Idaho side . So Fred took Ide Brink , the most versatile of the Pocatello messengerboys , to the capital , and a day or two later it appeared in The Statesman that Miss Chamberlain ( then about forty years old ) and her aged mother had suffered a violent attack of what was diagnosed as ptomaine poisoning . Since Miss Chamberlain was so prominent in state politics , the fact that she had been poisoned with food was a challenge to our old friend , Commissioner Jerry Hubert , who questioned the ladies as soon as they were able to talk , and got samples of everything they had eaten , except the milk they had drunk . Jerry could not get any of the milk , because they had finished what there was of it , but he was not one to be foiled by difficultiesattendant on an investigation . Jerry searched the Chamberlain kitchen and cupboard and found one piece of pie which , Mrs. Chamberlain assured him , had been made with the suspected milk as an ingredient . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pie to the State Chemist , whose name was Mason . The shot was taken in the latter 's laboratory , and the whole Boise public and readers throughout Idaho were in suspense , awaiting the results of Chemist Mason 's magic tests . A white rat who had been chosen for the purpose and carefully photographedwas given some of the pie , with a bit of cheese to make it more attractive . But a Democratic cat from a nearby saloon got into the laboratory , caught and devoured the white rat , before the latter had time to display any symptoms , and some impetuous attendant shot the cat before the cat had time to react to the rat and the pie . There was still quite a lot of the pie left , about six cubic inches , according to The Statesman , and Chemist Mason , backed by Commissioner Hubert , assured the public , through the press , that no stonep207would be left unturned until the matter was settled , one way or another . Mrs. Chamberlain had used two cups of milk to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fifteen percent , so it was computed that in the pie crust available after the rat test had gone wrong , there must be about 2.17 fluid ounces of the questionable milk . The milk , by the way , had been spiked by Ide Brink with a nauseating substance known as Croton Oil . He had put about two tablespoonfuls of Croton Oil in the quart bottle of milk early one morning , when it had been exposed on the Chamberlains ' back doorstep . How much Croton Oil there would be in 2.17 fluid ounces of milk made into pie crust , State Chemist Mason never determined , since he never found out that any Croton Oil had been administered . Some days after we had got word that the Dilly and the girls were aboard an eastbound N.P. train , and just before Miss Chamberlain was well enough to travel to St. Anthony and thence to Jackson , Commissioner Hubert had to announce , with a face very red , that the State Chemist had made more inconclusive tests , that the pie crust was all gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her old mother'sviolent attack would remain forever unsolved . Commissioner Jerry , however , had clamped down on the unfortunate milkman who had left the quart on Miss Chamberlain'sback doorstep , had found his milk contained too high a proportion of powdered manure and other foreign matter , and condemned the protesting milkman 's dairy until further notice . Miss Chamberlain , on learning the results of the milk analysis , refused to take to her bed again , but her old mother , highly suggestible , went back to bed for three more days , and never was known to drink milk again , or to use raw milk for cooking . The Democratic saloon keeper , with the backing of the Boise city administration , then also Democratic , submitted a bill for $10 on account of his cat , and threatened to sue Statep208Chemist Mason in the bargain . The assistant who had shot the cat refused to pay a dime or even apologize . The members of the Boise women 's clubs who were active in the Societyfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( and had Democratichusbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats for testing poisons , the vivisectionists joined the hubbub , and the whole matter became a minor issue in the next state election.  |p209The  evening after the last gate was at the dam site , we all went up to Crowe 's cabin , for music , coffee and dancing . The snow was falling steadily , and the temperature was relatively mild , at four above zero . Toward midnight , when the graveyardshift came on , the thermometer went down to six or eight degrees , and the hard snow , landing on the surface of the lake a little slantwise made a low hissing sound . I watched the muckers in the hole , and walked with George as he checked up on the carpenters who were building another sectionof forms . As George and I went over toward the office , for a talk where it was warm , we saw some dark shapes coming slowly our way , stood aside , and a herd of fifty or more elks moved past us and toward the shore of the lake , which now was frozen over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three feet of snow . A half hour later , more elks came . They had not changed their nature . Stark hunger had made them tame . For the tender tops of shrubs and the things elks feed on had been covered so deeply that elks could not nuzzle them out . Their legs were tired and shaky , and one or two of them lay down . Even in groups of harassed animals , most of which are doomed , there are the few who are resourceful and adaptable , as there are outstanding men among other men in collective peril . About four of the Jackson Hole elks who got as far asp210our camp were able to put aside their instinctive distrust of humankind and entered the mess hall , walking up and down the aisles between the long tables , to eat hunks of bread the roughnecks fed them . Those four acquired names , and regardless of sex , were known as Matthew , Mark , Luke and John . Two were bulls , with large spreads of splintered horns . The other two were female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stuffed and mounted on a wall . The Reclamation Service was paying ranchers for beef and getting elk meat , instead . Had those of us who shared elk sufferings been authorized , or even encouraged or permitted to shoot stray elks , mercifully , and present them to our somewhatmottled Mater , the U.S.R.S. , the U. S. Treasury would have benefited , probably . Unfortunately , most amateur hunters show a remarkable tendency to shoot one another , which elks must relish . I had an amateur hunt with Norman Torrance one Sunday morning after the snow had fallen . He woke up early , for a change , saw me making preparations , and decided to join me . Now Torrance was the most inspired designer of structures I ever met , and today heads , with distinction , the designing department of one of the largest engineering-financing concencernsin the world . He was not in 1910 , and is not now , the ideal companion on a hunt for sitting grouse . I realize that sportsmen will cringe at those words , but it is easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a grouse with a rifle than to stalk him , startle him , wait for him to fly , and then plug him full of tiny holes from a shotgun shell . Torrance and I started out on skis across the snow-covered lake , each with a rifle and a game bag . The snow was suspendedfor a while in gray clouds that hid the mountains , so ahead of us lay an expanse of white and beyond an indeterminatevagueness which moved on as we moved , and no faster . The going was easy , on the level , and Torrance chattered all the way , until I suggested as we neared the shore of Elkp211Island , that the grouse might overhear what he said and be shocked . Sound carries miraculously in a medium of enclosed silence and fantastic cold . Elk Island , which lay southeast of our camp , must have been in prehistoric ages a runt Teton , for it rose to a height below the timber line and thus did not obscure our view of the grand ridge a few miles beyond . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ski-meisters in the Tyrol or at Dartmouth College , but I made progress in the direction in which I wanted to go , without too much wear and tear on my tissues which lacked the customary breakfast reinforcement . When I saw what Torrance , honor student of one of our best scientific institutions , was doing , I sweated profusely , at twenty degrees Fahrenheit below zero . In order to help himselfup the slope behind me , he was using his rifle , front end downward , as a ski pole , and sticking it into the snow . Furthermore , the safety catch was off . Forgetting seniority and rank for the time , I took away Torrance'sgun , unloaded it , threw the cartridges away , and gave it back to him . Of course , as soon as he thought , scientifically , about plugging the end of a rifle barrel before discharginginto it a charge of high explosive behind a steel bullet , he sat down in the snow , content to let me go ahead , shoot the birds we needed for breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skeet . Shake . You saved my life , " he said . " The wisdom of that we 'll discuss some time later . " We have discussed it many times , in various places , rangingfrom Durgin Park 's in Boston , to silver mines in Mexico , cafes in Paris , and , as my guest , in movie studios in Southern California , where Torrance , as incorrigible as he was in his youth , cared little for the plots and intensely about female performers , stand-ins , secretaries or young visitors from convents , accompanied by nuns . Torrance was one of the few men in camp who did notp212care a whoop whether we were snowbound and cut off from all external communication , or free to talk and travel , receive and send mail , and read out-of-date newspapers . Dawn was as sweet and plump as ever , cooked like a true daughter of Massachusetts ( vintage early nineteen-hundred ) , and listened to his volatile talk without recording too many assorted little dents or scratches on her cerebrum , cerebellum , or medulla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days to get used to the idea that our band of workers for Reclamation and pay had been unified by complete isolation , with the dying elks , the living birds , the fish beneath the ice , and our consciences , of which there were practically all kinds . The telephone line we had hopefully constructed , on poles eighteen feet high , was submergedin snow in several stretches . If one man with one shovel can shovel twenty cubic yards of snow in an eight-hour day , with a boss looking on , three hundred men with any number of shovels could shovel X yards of snow in the course of a Jackson Hole winter , and X would make a rather puny impression on the snow that was there . There was always more snow where the last snow had come from . It obscured the shacks and cabins of our camp to the eaves , and blanked out the windows . That made it easier to keep warm , and harder to get from one to another . In one respect , it made the task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of brush and swamp land by working on skis and sight long distances , horizontally , without vertical obstructions . As instrument man , I had difficulty in getting a clear view through the telescopes of the transit and level because the front end would freeze over , at fifty-five below zero , before I could get around to the back end . The sections of the dam in which concrete was being laid and gates being set were boarded over and heated by steam , and , under conditions not to be recommended for ordinary jobs , our dam was growing and nothing short of anp213earthquake was likely to displace it or break it later . The flesh over our cheekbones froze many times each day , and became dark spots devoid of feeling . We could wear turtlenecksweaters pulled up to our chins , and heavy fur caps down to our eyebrows . The zone between got as brown and tough as leather , so that indoors , with necks and foreheads white , we looked like characters made up for The Beggars ' Opera . One day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger , who said he was a hunter from Boise and had strayed away from a group of sportsmen and lost his horse some weeks previously , had , after incredible expedientsand long exposure , got within hailing distance of Sim 's main cabin and then had got snarled in a buried dead tree top and had broken both legs . Doc Shaw and I got out our skis and started for Edwards ' Ranch , and were able to follow Sim 's snowshoe trail for an hour before fresh snow blotted them out . We got to the ranch , several hours later , with beginners ' luck . Doc set the broken bones , put the stranger 's legs in rough casts , and after an evening during which all hands kept Granny in a rage , and a good night 's rest , started back for camp , accompanied by two of Sim 's men , and taking turns dragging the big sled on which the hunter , Hanson J. McCaffrey , was stretched . Every few miles we had to stop , build a fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very troubled . His wife back in Boise , he insisted , would be worried , since he must already have been reported lost and given up for dead . Doc , to cheer him , said that he had never known of a case in which a wife died from worry about a missing husband , and the way McCaffrey received that bit of solace indicated that his wife had always been fond of him , as far as he knew , but was of a sociable restless nature which might cause her to be susceptible and overimpulsive . " Think how glad she 'll be to see you , next spring , after thinking all winter that you must be dead , " Doc said . Mc/Caffrey said that he could think about that much better with a slug of whiskey under his belt , but Doc , already wise to the ways of cold and hard liquor , would give the patient nothing stronger than beer , which , after it has been frozen , is not as weak as in its natural state . " But dammit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somehow . And the guys who were hunting with me ? Some of them may do worse than I did . They 're not the kind to give up when a friend 's in trouble , " said McCaffrey . " We 'll make up a pot , and post a big reward for the man who thinks of a way to get a message out of this Hole before April , " Doc said . The patient gurgled and groaned . He was grateful to Doc and everyone , however . " Are you sure I 'm all right ? I 'm not in awful pain , " McCaffreysaid . " That 'll come in a day or two , " Doc assured him , but he added that he would take steps to relieve it and that by spring McCaffrey would be able to go fishing in some wild inaccessible place . " Not me , " McCaffrey said . " If I ever get home , out of this , and Flossie 's glad to see me , no more hunting or fishing for mine . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to . Christ . That 's a silly game . " " You 'll have time to learn bridge and , maybe , poker , " Doc said . " I do n't have to learn poker , " said McCaffrey . " You must n't think I 'm dumb , because I got lost and that horse got away . " " I 've got plenty of books you can read . About men who left their wives for a spell . You 'll learn a lot , " Doc said . " Some of ' em were in France . " " To hell with those , " McCaffrey said . " Now , Doc , you must know about women . . . how they act , under stress . " Both of Sim Edwards ' ranch hands guffawed.  | " Do n't tell him , Doc . He 's got troubles enough , " one of them said . " Oh , Jesus . But , Flossie ! I hate to say it , but we had quite a row , about my going hunting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and say that Jesus loved her , if no one else did . " " That does it , " said the other ranch hand . " That 's all you needed , friend . " I do not know exactly how our talk affected McCaffrey , but for the rest of us it helped make that trip seem shorter and not quite so tough . Our group , with the victim on a sled , got quite a reception when we pulled into camp . The word got around by the time we got to the hospital shack . It had been snowing so hard that no one could see us approaching . McCaffrey was installed in a comfortable cot , and both legs hoisted up , with pulleys , suspended from what the men called skyhooks in the ceiling . A real skyhook , of course , has never been devised , not to this day , and a fortune is waiting for whoever invents one which will work . It will save half the cost of most constructionjobs , whenever our practical scientists perfect one . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson Lake gang , but there were many , and several men got hurt , one way or another , not many fatally . Those who had minor injuries and ailments trooped in and out of Doc 's hospital tent and modified their language as they crossed the threshold , on account of Nurse Waldron , a most capable little woman who already had shown preference for the social attentions of Joe Markham , the day timekeeper . The patients would lounge in the front office , watching Doc work on one or another , and when the door was open into McCaffrey 's room , would tell about experiences they had had or heard about , involving wives whose husbands were away , and especially about wives who had quarreled with their husbands just before the latter had departed . There werep216endless discussions of the nature of women , what proportion were chaste , those who had been born wanton , and the thousandsor millions in between . Doc was asked all sorts of questionsin that field , as to how long a lively woman can go , unmated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and based on his best observations and knowledge , but Nurse Waldron , quite often , would sneak into McCaffrey 's room , take his temperature , and scold Doc and the others if it had taken a jump . Johanna did not point to McCaffrey that her own record was without a blemish , but I am sure he assumed that it was , and repeated to himself that if one woman can control herself , so could another . Only Johanna 's disposition was much steadier than Flossie 's , he admitted on the dingiest days , and who could say that women were alike . " Doc , " McCaffrey begged . " Be a sport . If there 's any way a man can tell , you ought to put me wise . " Doc , as far as I know , did not suggest any feasible method . When one has spent the autumn in the midst of America 's most breathtaking scenery , and slowly it disappears and for weeks on end presents white planes and drifts , immobile , or swirling white in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple , mauve , violet , puce , beige , blur of shacks , chimneys , derrick masts , smudged evergreens , one tries to remember what the lake , the mountains and a clear sky looked like . When one has eaten elk meat and trout , as an almost steady diet , and learns those viands were meant to be occasional , one shifts to salt mackerel from firkins , macaroni and mouse-trap cheese , corned beef from cans , canned tomatoes , prunes , and tapioca pudding for variety . Coffee remains coffee , however , and a strong dose of red-eye before and after eating keeps digestion up to par . Our cabin was filled with music , and in the late hours we could read there , or talk , or watch the log glow on the hearth . I was interested to see how Wise would act , when hep217could no longer write long letters and send them , or receive short ones in return . I was astonished and pleased when , two days after we were hopelessly shut in , and knew that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pale , dry , way late in the evening , and paid an eloquent tribute to the charm and beauty , not of Lulu Lucas , who had trimmed him proper on the Yellowstone , or Emily , the flower of Ashton , but another girl whom he had met in a railroad waiting room back in St. Paul , some time in between . Emily 's letters , tied with government tape , were in one of his suitcases , but he never took them out , to reread them , and he never wrote any which could not be mailed , to relieve his mind . Wise 's seeming lack of constancy gave me a twinge of conscience , however , and I started a letter , in diary form , which I hoped to deliver in person to Elizabeth Wong , as soon as the job at Jackson Lake was done , which would be in early spring . I thought of Elizabeth , too , when I saw , in my own suitcase , tossed into the bottom with odd socks , garters , shoe strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minus .75 cents a day for subsistence ( inadequate word ) , which I received on the first of every month , for work accomplished during the month preceding and which could not be cashed , let alone spent , in snowbound Jackson Hole . I intended to make a modest contribution toward Chinese freedom , of course , but principally I wanted to buy some presentsfor Elizabeth , and in the case of a girl who could make such exquisite articles herself , what could I do , with my checks and undeveloped taste that would express what I felt , in terms of the aesthetic ? I wish that I had bought some Chinese sheet music from Montgomery Ward , if any existed , but I tried to lend an Oriental flavor to the German classics , meanwhile , and to play Beethoven , my all-time favorite of the lot , as Elizabeth might play , if she could play , had been the star pupil of Gabrilowitsch , and was as strong as I was . At Jackson Lake that winter , all confusion about govern/ments was resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one discounted snow , frost , cold and geographical remoteness . When Steve was found murdered in his bed , knifed in such a way that he could not have done it himself , Crowe was annoyed and puzzled . He knew he did not have a burglar'schance of finding out who did it , and he had often felt the impulse to extinguish Steve , himself . The hobo whom Steve had knocked out with a pick handle when he caught him in the act of depriving a dying elk of his teeth had an alibi no one could doubt . He was in the hospital when Steve was killed , and , as far as we could find out , had no friends . To bury Steve , we had to tunnel through the snow to the frozen mountain side and blast out a tomb . Some Austrian had a Roman Catholic prayer book , and Doc Shaw , the nearestapproach to a clergyman available , read the service in Latin , accentuated by the frost from his breath . One evening , few of us knew what day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near and the time for preparing a monthly estimate was about due , a bunch of us were working in the office , with a few men gathered idly around the pot-bellied stove . Crowe dropped in for a few minutes , to encourage us , and later wished that he had not , for when he left , alone , he went into the cookshack and what he saw , involving Fritz and the young flunky named Walter might not have drawn more than a passing " also " from O.O . ProfessorRichard von Krafft-Ebing , or any other accredited member of the faculty Fur Psychiatric und Nervenkrank -- heiten an der K. K. Universitat Wien , but the tableau upset Frank Crowe , B.S. , from the University of Maine , no end . He had devoted his young life , thus far , to hard work , study , engineering and such distractions as made no extraordinary demands on the tolerance of his fellow-citizens and fell within the limits of the ordinary codes . " Christ , Frank ! Have you seen a ghost ? " Doc Shaw asked , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p219It  was some time before Crowe , shuddering and blushing , between spasms of nausea , could convey the slightest idea of what he had seen . Doc was about to laugh , then quickly changed his mind . " What a pity ! " Doc said . McCaffrey , from the ward inside , began bellowing , growlingand gurgling : " You mean to say . . . The cook . . . that cooks for all of us . String him up . Drill him full of holes . Jesus , let me out of here . " The two other patients woke up and the one who could speak English asked what the row was about . Doc hurried in to soft-pedal McCaffrey . " Keep your shirt on , Mac , " Doc said . " This must n't get around . " Crowe was sitting disconsolately in a corner of the office , limp , his chin cupped in his hands , thinking fast and getting nowhere . " I would n't have believed . . . " he mumbled , and shook his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had overheard , stepped back into the office , knowing there was nothing McCaffrey was less likely to forget . " What can we do ? Build a jail ? " Crowe asked , disconsolate and calmer for a moment . He was aware dimly that around him and his camp , which had taken on monstrous aspects beyond his comprehension or control , was a barrier of snow , closing in on all sides , and utterly impassable . A few men , if they were built for it , might get as far as Jackson , or Edwards ' Ranch . Doc , obliged to give play to his keen sense of humor at last , could not help chuckling . " You 'd have to build two jails , or keep Fritz in chains . " The rage and brute repulsion of abnormalities burst out from Crowe . He rose , eyes blazing . " Fritz ! That son of a bitch ! He 's to blame . I 'll lock him upp220in the powder house , or the pest house , and let him freeze to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy ? " asked Doc . " What about the little . . . " Crowe could find no word , and that stumped him . He had dimly heard that such things happened , in depraved foreign lands , but he had never believedor disbelieved in their reality . " You ca n't turn him loose for the rest of the camp . Be sensible , Frank . These men have been cooped up . . . " " You mean there 'd be more of ' em ? Oh , God . . . No . Oh , hell ! That big squarehead must have threatened the kid . He must have had him buffaloed . " " The kid , as you call him , " Doc said . " He was n't screaming , or resisting , was he ? " In trying not to recall the details , Crowe covered his face with his hands , and shook like a leaf . When he uncovered his face again , his teeth were chattering . Doc pressed his point . " A kid like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc said . " You know . Like the bee and the clover . " Crowe gagged again . " I 'm sorry , " Doc said , gravely . " This is my fault , Frank . I should have spotted those two . . . . Now it 's as plain as the nose on your face . " " Fritz claimed the kid was his brother , " said Crowe . " I 'll brother that bastard . I 'll beat hell out of him . I 'll chain him up like a dog and turn him over . . . " " To whom ? And when ? " Doc asked . " You 're the boss around here . " For the first time since the camp was started , Crowe wanted to disown it , and especially its leadership . " Just how could I explain ? " Crowe demanded . " The rest of the bunch would lynch the low-down skunk , and good enough for him . " " Get Skeet over here , " Doc said . " And Oscar . Quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " If I thought they knew , and had kept their mouths shut all this time , I 'd can ' em on the spot , " said Crowe . " Do n't go off your rocker , " said Doc . " What I meant was , they 'd know if there 'd been any talk around camp , any kiddingabout Fritz and the boy . Jesus , Frank , I 'm supposed to be a doctor . An M.D. If I 've been so God-damn dumb , maybethe others have , too . Let 's hope so . " A Bohunk who was recovering from a broken wrist appeared at the door of my cabin and banged hard with his good mittened hand . " They want you at the hospital , " he said . I assumed it was an emergency surgical case , having been summoned to help Doc and Johanna several times before . Wise , sleeping on one of his profoundest levels , did not even stir or groan as I lit the lamp , got dressed , shivering like a smelt , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , then followed him across the flat , between high walls of snow . Aldebaran , Betelgeuse and a few others of the brightestwere showing dim pin-points that night . " Who 's hurt ? " I asked the Bohunk . He grinned , which puzzled me , and afterward alarmed me . His name was Lasli Grumich , according to the timebook , he was paid $2.25 , our basic rate , and had never been to school . But he had long before caught on to Fritz and his Iowan paramour , accepted their snug relationship , if he had not dimly envied the cook , and let the matter rest . Serbs thought the worst of Germans , on sight , in those years when the Kaiser and T. R. were the greatest of pals and Harvard was exchangingstudents with Heidelberg . When I entered Doc 's little front office , I saw Oscar sitting there , looking like a tomcat who had swallowed a couple of birds . He was not hurt , and showed no signs of illness . Crowe looked like the patient , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that the case was notp222hopeless . Doc had on his enigmatic mask-like expression that gave me a start . Something , I knew , was enormously wrong . Crowe closed the door , chased the Bohunk back into the ward , where he had been acting as night watchman , and said : " All right , Doc . You explain . " Then Crowe remembered something and confronted me , gruffly . " By the way , was n't it you who first talked to that stinking head cook , back in Ashton ? " " Very likely , " I said . " What 's wrong with him ? " Crowe turned away , and ground his teeth so hard I was afraid his cheekbones would pop out of his face . Oscar was looking at me , quizzically , enjoying the bizarre situation . Doc stepped in and motioned for Crowe to sit down . " Did you notice anything peculiar about Fritz and that brother of his ? " I noticed plenty , then , as if my mind were reeling backwards . " Come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crowe came up like a jack-in-the-box . " Then why the hell . . Doc motioned him away again . " What is this ? A trial ? " I asked , a little sore . " You bet it is , " muttered Crowe . " What did you notice ? " Doc went on . " The difference in their accents , " I said . " Who cares about that ? If they want to do a brother act . . . Crowe coughed and choked , and Doc had to look away to keep from exploding with laughter . " They 're closer than brothers , " Doc said . " Crowe barged into the cookshack tonight and caught them in fragrant delight . What we want to know is whether anyone else is wise to them , and , if so . . . " " Skeet ! By God . If you . . . Why I should have got so angry , all of a sudden , I cannotp223say . " Look , Frank , " I said , " it 's none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it is , give me my time . " Then I remembered about the snow , and how we all were stuck there . Crowe climbed down , and begged my pardon , and then asked , quite pathetically , if I had heard anything in camp about what he had seen and what the pair had done , and were there any more of that kind around . Both Oscar and I told him , truthfully , that the rest of the camp was either ignorant or indifferent . I could have said that some of the Bohunks must have caught on , but I did not , since that would have involved Lasli Grumich and God knew who else . We all got into harmony again , and tried to figure out what to do . I said frankly that , if I were running things , I would do nothing whatsoever , except to have Doc talk with Fritz and Walter and threaten them with mayhem if they were not in the future more careful . But Crowe could not take the easiest way . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing and serving of food had been established in his mind that he was determined that Fritz and his cherubic-looking young flunky would leave camp that night , and not even wait to serve breakfast . " We 'll never get such grub , " said Oscar , wistfully . " Unless Spinoza . . . " Spinoza was out of the question . Wilfred had meant to follow Crowe 's instructions and come to the main camp when he closed Squirrel Meadows , but a sudden storm had caught him , and he , with his crew , had had to hole in there , with what results we did not know , and could not find out for months . " They 've got to go , tonight , " insisted Crowe . " We 'll have to tell the gang in the morning that they just lit out , without saying a word , and got lost in the snow . " " They will get lost in the snow , " Doc said . " After all , Frank , even in England , a man does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The worst is twenty years . "  |p224Crowe  turned to me . " Can the skunks ski ? " " I never saw them try it , " I said . In the end , Scotty was routed out of bed , and under the faint starlight , he and I escorted Fritz and Walter as far as Jackson , where they got rooms in the only hotel and were left with the mischievous guides . The few men in camp who were not in on the secret were allowed to think that the cook and the boy had got restless , or gone jointly crazy , and tried a suicidal escape . Naturally , Scotty and I were careful not to say a word in Jackson as to why the town had guests and both victimsof their inclinations were so badly frightened that I thought they would be extremely careful not to give themselvesaway . What caused me the strongest misgivings was the likelihood that those irrepressible guides , who had nothing to do all winter except play jokes on each other and anyone who strayed into their midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goad Fritz into betraying his guilty passion by shielding and defending him so hysterically that truth would prevail . On the consequences of such a disclosure , I , knowing that wild bunch of guides , who were cooped up like monkeys for the winter , did not dare to speculate . From that time on , the grub at Jackson Lake was so atrociousthat bloodshed was narrowly avoided , three times each day , and I think that Crowe , in spite of his disgust and horror , wished that Fritz were back , with any number of boys his fancy required.  |p225That  trip with the outcasts , from Moran to Jackson , on skis in dead winter , mounting painfully , skirting the side hills , descending cautiously when we had to , then repeating the process again , offered in contrast the majesty and brutality of nature , and drama , both human and divine . Scotty broke trail for Fritz , who was a powerful , determined , stubborn man , as proud as he was helpless . Scotty was broad-minded enough , but lacked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of us were ignorant of an ocean of psychology and biology and physiology , of vice and instinct , of others , of ourselves , of evasion , and of being found out . Behind me , the boy with the slender hands , white skin and long curved eyelashes , bundled up in what clothes he had and what I had " loaned " him , kept his balance fairly well , shoving one ski ahead , then another , his eyes for the most part on my skis , learning and protesting simultaneously . I developed a charley horse , broke a strap , and found various ways of giving our charges a rest . Scotty caught on , and was decently ashamed , but once we got started again , something drove him onward at a rate that for beginners was barely possible , but not quite impossible , exacting the maximum fatigue and , on Fritz 's part , dissemblance . Fritz would not give in . He said not a word , breathed hard , threw back his head and spat toward the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was sure he could keep up , and would not be left to the wolves whose eyes we saw watching from the cover of evergreen branches above the level of the snow , started reproaching Fritz and became more openly abusive when he sensed that neither Scotty nor I would silence him or beat him up . " I told you , you big slob , " he whined to Fritz . " Stale carrots , " Fritz muttered . That had me puzzled for a while . " If it was n't for you , I 'd be back in camp , without you . You would n't tell Crowe whose fault it was , " the boy said . He addressed me a moment . " What could I do , with a bruiser like him ? " " Stale carrots , " Fritz murmured , again . " That 's what you smell like . I lowered myself , you little whore . " Scotty slowed down , to give them all the breath they needed for the dialogue . I felt certain , before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Crowe , the casual Pontius Pilate role of Doc Shaw , and Scotty 's fixing of the blame with the larger and stronger party , was not in accordance with the facts . In a sense , the boy was flirting as he skied along , provokingFritz to an outburst that failed to explode , setting fuses with detonation caps and small stub ends of dynamite , because he , Walter , incapable of physical violence , could not do without it , and must get it from without . " What could I do ? " the boy repeated to me . Actually , there was little difference in our ages . He might have been eighteen , in Sodom and Gomorrah , and I would have been twenty in Boston , Massachusetts . " Do n't ask me , " I said , but not unkindly . " What could he do ? " Fritz grunted . " Not much . " But all Fritz 's remarks were addressed to himself , sotto voce . He scorned the rest of us . " Him and his cordon bleu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused the linguist ,  |p227Fritz  , to wince . " He learned to cook in the guard house , " the boy continued . " In North Africa . He should have stayed there . " " Verfluchte Hare ! I demeaned myself , " Fritz whispered . " You guys better get this all out of your system before we get to Jackson . Those guides 'll ride you on a rail , " Scotty said . I still could not be sure just what , precisely , they had done . I felt like extinguishing Walter and letting Fritz go free . But where ? To say that the men in camp fell for what little was told them would do those men an injustice . Most of them had been around , and some had noticed quite a lot , especially , it seemed to me , about cooks , flunkies and sailors . Doc 's wisdom in failing to discourage Crowe from getting Walter out of camp was clear , but the absent Fritz was the butt of most of the resentment , although there was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give than to receive . And , of course , Scotty and I got plenty of unmerciful kidding from Oscar , Wise and others , including a few knowing winks from Lasli Grumich , Stenko Vorkopich , Jaime Echegaray , Ascensio Gutierrez , Klaus Pfeisterberg , Larry O'Brien and the rugged Bob Sass . What troubled me most was the effect of the affair on the night timekeeper , George . Up to the time Fritz and Walter " disappeared , " George had been acting quite normal . The next day  --  George slept a few hours in the daytime  --  he took to the floor again , protected from drafts by the snow that fell a little faster than the crumb boss and his helpers could sweep or shovel it away . I know George was not " queer , " in the derogatory sense of the word , but I was equally sure that others might misunderstand , as many of them did . George had enough to contend with , outside of that devastating taint . In the case of George , who knew all the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stumbled , as it were , on the direct evidence , it was the injusticep228that preyed on his mind . He had broken a boy 's back who had got in the way when George 's head was down and he was charging . For that George had never been punished by society , but only by himself . That unfortunate accident had made George overconscious of boys , I think , of their fate and breakability , but George , so sensitive and just , knew in his heart that the culprit , if there was one , was not Fritz , unless weaknessis criminal when embodied in stature and strength . Anyway , George lost weight , acted unaccountably , and , to his sickening disgust , grew an unsightly batch of boils and pimples for which he would accept no treatment and which gave him such a sense of uncleanliness that he withdrew into himself to loathe himself more thoroughly and steadily decline . How many times I wished for Spinoza to be with us , and exert his healing influence he was wasting on the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gang had accepted his worth . One day , as a derrick mast rose above the hole with an orange-peel bucket dangling , a rock that had not slid out with the others when the bucket had previously been dumped , was turned loose in mid-air and descended . Below , a few carpenters and helpers , including Oscar , were working on some forms . A young Mormon named Moroni was holdingrather firmly one end of a two-by-four which rested on top of a sawhorse . The two-by-four was rough and splintery , about six feet long . It was balanced over the sawhorse , three feet on each side . The falling rock hit the free end and drove the Mormon 's end into his gloved hand , with a force that could only be computed by those who understood the laws of falling bodies and of leverage . I was working with the surveying party about half a mile away , and received a hurry call from Doc . Moroni , a country boy from Utah , was sitting in a wooden chair in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cricket without a chirp , was moving efficiently , with a basin , and hotp229water and antiseptic . Doc was preparing a hypodermic . The Mormon boy looked up at my eyes with his own , dull and brown and fatalistic , then down at what had been a hand in a cheap cotton glove . But Doc 's eyes were shining . I looked at Doc , and my unspoken question was answered with no words and a smile . " Will he lose it ? " I refrained from asking . " Wait and see , " Doc did not answer . Crowe had not protested , exactly , when he saw the order , prepared the previous September when the world was ours , but he had cringed a bit . An X-ray outfit ran into money in those days , and money , in the Reclamation Fund , was runninglow . Anyway , the X-ray machine was there . Doc injected a local anaesthetic somewhere along the upper part of Moroni'sarm . Then he sat down , and Johanna Waldron stood ready with a tray of implements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hell of a job . Before we X-ray the wrist and hand , we 've got to get these splinters out , and the pieces of cloth . " Moroni , suffering no pain and containing his apprehension , sat still , his eyes moving from the instruments to Doc 's hands , the wreck of his own hand , the nurse , and through the door to the small operating room where there was an adjustable table and several complicated devices , and a bucket into which , already , several limbs and members had dropped on other days and nights . " I 've got to keep my hand steady , and my eyes from getting tired , " Doc said . He was working with tweezers and a magnifyingglass . " I 'll take the hard ones , and you can spell me with the easy ones , " he said , withdrawing a jagged splinter of pine discolored with dirt , cotton thread and a very little blood . What Moroni said was much quoted . " Good thing it was n't Oscar , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it around camp . Oscar hadp230been holding another two-by-four when the rock hit about three feet away . I got myself together and sat down , when Doc stood up . He indicated a few splinters for me to work on , and I tried to be professional and careful . All I could achieve was to be extra grave . " You wo n't hurt him , " Doc said , as if Moroni were not there . " But do as little damage as you can . . . to the flesh and the tendons , I mean . " When blood appeared , the nurse swabbed it away , and received my bloody splinters on her tray . When we stopped for lunch she fed Moroni and got a pillow for his back , to slip behind him in the chair . By dinner time , all the wood and cloth we could get had been removed , in innumerable bits , and we were late for the meal because the hand had to be washed and a tourniquet applied to stop the bleeding . Late that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that many angles , he peered at the negatives and made comments as he held them to the light . He counted fourteen broken bones , smashed joints and dislocations in the wrist , the hand and the fingers . Moroni was put to bed and was asleep in a very few minutes . Doc slept an hour , and I did , too , on one of the hospital cots . Some time after midnight , Doc got up and we went to the cookshack for coffee . " I 'm going to try to save it , " he said . " Ten to one he developsinfection . But if we have to , we can take it off any time . " I nodded , and choked . Doc , of course , had to take a gamble with Moroni 's life at one-to-ten against septicemia . We went back to the hospital ; Doc set the most important fractures and put Moroni 's hand and forearm in a temporary plaster cast . Whenever the bones got set , after that , Doc would take pictures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set it over again . He grafted some skin from Moroni 's left forearm to the top of Moroni 's right hand , and some morep231from the top of the left hand to the palm of the right . There was no blood-poisoning , and Moroni became a fixture around the hospital , where he tried to do what he could , left-handed . The Basques in camp were the most inveterate gamblers . An Anglo-Saxon gambler tries to keep the illusion that he is restrained and smart , cool , clear-headed , irrevocable . A Basque does not deceive himself . Betting , with him , is not an intellectual exercise , or an exhibition of pukka sahibismo . He takes chances for their own sake . A Basque is not a chump . He will not make a bet if there is no chance to win , but the percentage , if it corresponds to the odds , can be small indeed . When Moroni was hurt , and was helped out of the hole by his comrades and ridden on a sled , between snow walls ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-rock men gave four to one that the hand would come off before noon that same day . What little cash there had been in camp had gravitated into the socks or under the mattresses of those who attract money , and those who repel it had Government checks . At the commissary , where a mild Swede called Battling Nelson was clerk , articles of clothing , tobacco , and a few odds and ends could be bought . Men on the payroll had credit . The stakeholderand arbiter for the sporting element was Hanson T. McCaffrey . He had no money , either , except a few thousand dollars in a Boise bank . His savings might as well have beenin the Royal Treasury of Timbuktu . He had offered to go to I work , but Crowe , who always resented McCaffrey 's intrusion , could think of no way he could be useful until McCaffrey , nettled , proposed a deal with Crowe to fish through the ice and supply the camp with fish at ten cents a pound . Ben Sheffield , afraid that the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as crumb boss at the deserted dude ranch . To relieve his boredom , and keep his mind off his wife , McCaffrey accepted the lowly employment as soon as he could discard his crutches.  |p232Just  after Fritz and Walter had been kicked out of camp , McCaffrey had made a few violent remarks about what should be done with practicing homosexuals . It was Oscar who hushed up McCaffrey that time . " Mac ! Think what you 're saying . If there were enough muzzlers in Boise , you 'd feel as safe as hell . Your wife could take ' em in , as lodgers , and never be bothered at night , " Oscar said . " Look ! I 'm not a pauper ! I had a damn good little business . A florist 's shop . Flossie would n't take in roomers . She 'd know damn well that would shame me in town , " Mac objected plaintively . " Can she draw your dough from the bank ? " Oscar asked . McCaffrey turned green . " I never thought of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . Did she ever take in washing ? " " Do n't talk like that . We 've got friends . . . The busi-ness . " " She thinks you 're dead . Did you make out a will ? " McCaffrey turned another shade of green . " Before I was married , " he said . " A marriage nullifies all wills , " said Oscar . " You died intestate . Only they have n't found you , yet . To straighten out a mess like that takes years and years . If I were you , I 'd pray that all the city of Boise 's gone queer  --  the men , I mean . How would you feel about women ? That would n't be quite as bad , now would it ? You could n't get all worked up , and jealous , if some woman came along . . . " MccCaffrey started to hop up and down . " I would n't ? Say ! I 'd strangle the pair of ' em . I 'd throw ' em downstairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly calm and more confidential . " Mac ! Listen ! " he said . " A man as excitable as you is likely to do anything . Why go back there at all ? You 're taking an awful chance . You do n't want to get yourself hanged , or sentp233to the rockpile , which sure as hell will happen . A man ca n't stomp or hatchet a woman , no matter how guilty she is . I ought to know . I was tempted more than once . But they are n't worth it . I tell you what . When we all get out o ' here , you take the first train east , from Pocatello , before anybody sees you who knows you . Make a fresh start , back East . That 's the place to sell flowers , anyway , not in some one-horse town in Idaho . Somebody 's sure to find a body that might as well be you , when the snow melts . Get wise to yourself , Mac . I 'm talkin ' for your own good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitiful , later that night , that Doc broke down and gave him a triple bromide . But as he did so , in Oscar 's presence , Doc rebuked the violinist . " You ought not to say such things , Oscar , " Doc said . " You 'd feel awful if they turned out to be true . " McCaffrey yelped and choked on the water and bromide powders . " Doc . Not you ! You do n't believe . . . " There was seldom a completely dull moment in camp . I wondered about that , and tried to understand the nature of dullness . To what extent was the monotony of cold and snow , thin starlight and heavy skies , fire waste , elk disaster , fir wind , pile-driver thumps , concrete-mixers ' grind , whistle at eight , at noon and at five , snow fresh , shovels , banjo torches , trickle of leakage from the pumps , frostbite , stew , frozen turds , beaten paths , clock ticks , days without mail , no phone , same mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible , lake sheet also white , monthly checks , anticipations , memories , short days , long darknesses , almost no theme and few variations  --  to what extent was that dull : ( a ) to a bum ; ( b ) to a mechanic ; ( c ) to a rounder ; ( d ) to a family man . One could go twice through the alphabet and each letter would be represented by a type on a dam-constructionjob . There had never been , and never will be , any damp234construction job quite like " spatiate " or Jackson Lake Dam , No. 2 . The original code word outlived its object . Abe Johnson , for instance , the carpenter boss . Abe was middle-aged , firm but obese , slow-moving , slow-thinking , methodical . He was the exception that proved the rule that all carpenters are slightly crazy , possibly in deference to the Carpenter 's Son who , in His day , was classed as an eccentric . Abe was an eccentric , inside out . He was too sensible and dependable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the men under them . If one of the said men is skillful , he feels that he is better than the boss and , consequently , that fate has dealt unfairly against him . If a working carpenter is dumb and awkward , the boss is always correcting him , and that makes him mad . Abe 's men got around it all by agreeing , more or less , that Abe was not a carpenter , but a cabinet maker who , for reasons known only to Reclamation , was the boss builder of rough forms to hold wet concrete in place and later to be removed and eventually discarded . Abe made camp furniture nights , for the fun of it . He made skis , for moderate fees , on the side , enough for all the engineers and pencil-stiffs who could use them . His forms on the dam never buckled , never proved to be too narrow , and if there was a waste of lumber involved , not even such a perfectionist as Frank Crowe could spot it . Next to Oscar Rydvall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . When he washed he glowed . His hair was always combed , but never looked marcelled . Abe , in the hierarchy of a construction camp , was somewhere in the middle . He was lower than the engineers and higher than the ordinary foremen . Hunter was over him , but never interfered . A jolly type named Goetz was under him , and seldom needed prompting . Goetz , by the way , was a carpenter first , and a solo player by avocation . He played that Western gamblinggame like His Honor Beelzebub , from the momentp235supper was over until all other players were dozing in their wooden chairs . Card games for money were forbidden in government camps , when the boss was around , but Crowe , with the single frightful exception I have already noted and which deprived us of cooking , had the knack of being elsewherewhen elsewhere was the better place for all concerned . Abe Johnson played no cards , but he was a wow at dominoes , that Arab stargazer 's game which is one of the few a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a champion . Abe fell just short of that class , and had to have an opponent . So I , being a pushover for all kinds of games , indoors or out , was the goat , not a mere plain goat but a glossy angora . I forgotas many domino spots as Abe remembered , but by immenseconcentration I could make him smile softly now and then . Little did I know that in acting as a foil for Abe , I was preparing myself for social life on the Balearic Islands , in years to come . I do not know why reasonable men who are brilliant like to give exotic food for thought to reasonable men who are steady , like Abe . But Wise , whose mind was never still and who was removed from the sphere of direct romantic love for the time , played a trick on Abe that turned out to be a classic . In February of that amazing winter , Wise , looking pale and distraught as only he could , took Abe aside one Sunday morning , slipped him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemmed , hawed , got a grip on himself , and said : " Abe , I 'm in one hell of a fix . " Abe 's heavy eyebrows went up , and his mind began working like the inside of a centrifugal pump the lower hose of which was not in water . " My , my , " he grunted , bewildered but deeply sympathetic . " I hate to ask it of you , but you 've got to help me , " Wise said . Probably it was Abe 's first thought that Wise wanted him to make something practically impossible to build . And fromp236that premise he tried to guess what such an article might be . How any man as intelligent as Wise could get himself into grave trouble in that camp , under winter conditions , was too much for Abe . The air in his shack almost jellied because of his concentration . After long preliminaries , carefully built up , Wise came out with his request . He rose , turned away , paced the floor , clenched his hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please do n't ask any questions ! I 've got to have two hundred bucks before lunch time today . I 've simply got to have it . " Wise started talking fast and avoiding Abe 's deepset eyes . " You 'll have it back on the first of the month . Every dime . I swear it on the Book , by my old mother 's memory . " " But . . . " Abe began to stammer . " If you turn me down , I 'm cooked . I 'm done for , " Wise pleaded , hysterically . " I 'll give you a note , an I.O.U . You can take my buffalo coat , and I 'll freeze , if I do n't come through right on the line . I 'll pay interest . . . six , ten percent . . . " Seeing how much Abe was hurt by that , Wise took another line . " You 're saying to yourself , why do n't I ask Crowe , or Scotty , or that bastard , Waite . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Finally , after trying to get in the reason for his hesitation , Abe broke through Wise 's abject tirade . He went to a cabinet , unlocked an outer drawer , revealed an inner drawer , unlockedthat with a trick key he had made , and held out his supply of cash . With pathetic earnestness , Abe counted the greenbacks and the gold and silver coins . The total was only sixty dollars and six bits . No more , no less . There were checks , galore , both government and personal . Wise waved those away . Wise acted as if he were going to faint . As Abe tried to press the cash into his hand , Wise turned away and slumped , completely desolate . He appeared to try to pull himself to/gether , rose to his full height , squared his narrow shoulders as best he could considering their conformation , and , grippingAbe 's hand , with tears in his eyes , hurried out of the shack . During the next few hours , Abe was seen plodding along snow paths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally to the hospital . Abe knew Doc Shaw would never turn any man down , but Doc had been tipped off , and could produce less than nine dollars in cash . At noon that day , when the whistle blew , Wise hung back and waited for the rest of us to walk over to the cookshack . Wise walked alone , the picture of woe . Neither David Warfieldnor Henry Miller could have put on a better act . As Wise neared the cookshack , Abe stepped from behind a pile of snow fifteen feet high and , beaming with sweet satisfaction , produced an envelope . " There it is . It 's all there . Every cent , " Abe said . " I got it , somehow . Count it , if you like . " Wise was transformed with joy and relief . He acted like a man in a trance , who is emerging from a nightmare into a dream of bliss . His thanks were so profuse and eloquent and his tributes to true friendship so touching that Abe squirmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers ' mess , side by side , and while Wise was eating heartily , like a man reprieved while a gallows was being built for him , Abe , midway through the meal , began to falter . He did not finish the roast elk and passed up the extra dessert . All afternoon he sat , alone in his shack , in deep meditation . Abe was trying to figure out how , cooped up there in camp , among men all of whom were living more or less on credit , an accountant could do any of the things , or commit any of the faults or sins or crimes that make men desperate for cash , right on the hour . Abe knew all the women , and was sure they were beyond reproach . There was nowhere a man could spend money , nowhere a creditor could invest cash or a debtorp238lack paper which would not be acceptable . There were no authorities to fear or buy off . No reports of anything extraordinaryhad been circulated . The first of the next month , namely March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little deeper in the snow . Insurance policies if they lapsed , outside , would have to lapse , even if a man had all the cash in Christendom . Mortgages on family homes would be foreclosed , or extended , according to the whims of distant banks . Neither honor nor personal safety could be involved in any way Abe could understand . During the days and evenings that followed , Abe was not himself . He was slower in his calculations , and made a few blunders setting the forms . His ears were open , his mouth closed , and nothing came to his attention that would ease the churning in his mind . When the first of the month came , those of us who were in on the situation , pretended to be nonchalant . Wise , only , was evasive . We had breakfast at Torrance 's cabin and skipped the noon meal in the mess . At supper , Wise was also absent . Abe ate almost nothing . His brow seemed to be clouded , like one of the mountains . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did not try to remove it . After supper , we all scattered to our various amusements and Abe made no move to join any of them . His dominoes had not been touched for a fortnight . Then , at five minutes before midnight , nearly an hour after Abe had gone to bed , but not to sleep , he heard a wild knock on his door . He grunted , got up , pulled on his pants , and opened it . There was Wise , the embodiment of everythinga grateful gentleman could be . Ceremoniously Wise took from his pocket a large envelope . " God , Abe , you saved my life . More than that . I 'll never forget . To the day I die I wo n't forget . If ever there is a time , believe me , Abe , when you need anything I 've got , or can beg , borrow or steal , it 's yours . You 'll have my address . Call up ,  |p239write  , wire , cable if you 're back in Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But . . . just one more favor . No matter what you suspect . . . think of me kindly . Remember we all make mistakes now and then . Man is frail . We 're not all solid and sensible , like you . . . Please do n't ask any questions . " With that , Wise spread the greenbacks and the coins on the table , by lantern light , and counted them , one by one , with a running total . He told us , afterward , that he almost broke down at that point , just when Abe began to be certain that each bill and each coin was identical with the ones he had given Wise . Abe recognized the $8.5o from Doc Shaw , the five dollar gold piece from Jaime Echegaray , and each individual unit of currency . Before Abe could formulate a word , Wise shook his hand , overwhelmed him with thanks and promises of eternal gratitude and friendship again , and went out into the snowy night . The next day , at noon , we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defeated in his posture , mien and manner . In fact , matters had gone so far that none of us , Wise least of all , would for worlds have confessed that the whole thing had been a joke . It had ceased to be a joke . Man 's essential decency to man had entered in , man 's faith , man 's hope , man 's prospects of communal existence . Before mid-March , Abe was almost himself again , but still had moments of absent-mindedness and lapses of routine attention . Wise went out of his way , whenever they met or were together , to do favors for Abe , in every little way , to show how he esteemed his worth , and in that way eventually Abe became convinced that , somehow , he had done a noble thing , beyond his modest ken , and he glowed , and sat in corners enjoying our fun , inarticulate but intensely present . For Abe , in effect , the winter was not dull . Abe , as stolid and unspectacular as any man in camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on earth are sitters in corners at parties . They appear to be solitary , and are all-embracing.  |p240My  cornpanero in music and sin , Oscar Rydvall , had never heard of Freud , in 1911 . Oscar caught up with the great Viennese and the gobbledegoopheit that issued from that bottomless volcano , and spread sex ashes all over the earth two years later , in Boise . Oscar and Freud should have known each other . Because , had Freud observed Oscar , much that has been written about split personalities might have taken a more complicated form , if that is possible . Oscar did not have a dual personality . He had a potful of personalities . For instance , he had many ways of getting drunk , that is , of behavingwhile and after getting drunk . And I do not use the expression " getting drunk " in a disparaging way . Getting drunk is one of the most wonderful things a man can do , if he raises the process to the realm of art . Of the several ways Oscar acted while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions he would be gay , not riotous , presumptuous , or offensive , but gay . He would bubble with merriment just to be alive , and still have a reservewhich poured out spontaneously in response to special stimuli . Again , he would be dignified , not stiff , aloof , superioror vain , just dignified . Seeing him in that mood , perfect strangers , men or women , would instinctively say to themselves , " There is a dignified man . " He would lend dignity to the race , and set an example for the undignified . He would justify a belief in evolution . Oscar 's gay drunks seldom got him or others into trouble , because , to most people , a man who is gay , with all his buttons , must necessarily be drunk , one way or another . But when Oscar 's drinking turned him into dignity 's groove , appalling consequences might ensue , because most people figured he was sober . On such an evening , Oscar , who had been in the camp hospitalbecause he had cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to be discharged and had been preparing himself for that transition between the status of patient andp241hospital alumnus by drinking , one swig every twenty minutes or so , from a bottle of Blackstone whiskey Wise and I had provided . The only other occupant of the hospital , then , was a Bohunk with bronchitis , for which whiskey was considered a specific by the patients , if not the doctors , those days . Oscar was too much of a gentleman to drink alone , and while the Bohunk became merry and tearful , by turns , Oscar put on the mantle of his dignity . Doc came in , finally , with Sooner Kulmus in tow and left Sooner with Oscar in the front office while Doc ministered to the Bohunk , a little surprised to find him so talkative when formerly he had been taciturn . Like so many men who do not drink to excess , Doc Shaw was singularly obtuse in detecting the effects of drink on others , and the hospital always had such a pleasant antiseptic smell , modified by the roughnecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragrance might be lost in the ensemble . When Doc emerged from the office , finding Sooner in stitches of laughter which hurt her sore back , and Oscar declaiminga bit of folklore in verse entitled " Down in the Lehigh Valley , " Doc restored order , noticed with pleasure that Oscar was ready for rough-carpentership again , and asked Sooner to sit quietly while he wrote out Oscar 's discharge , which had to be copied in quadruplicate , signed and lost in some pigeonhole until spring , or later , when communication with Washington , D.C. , could be re-established . Having signed the blanks without reading what was printed on them , Oscar lingered a while , loath to go back to the bunkhouse . Doc wanted to give Sooner some medicine in a bottle to take home with her and use , internally , as prescribed , and one of the ingredients was to be sweet spirits of nitre . " Hand me that bottle marked sweet spirits of nitre , " Doc said to Oscar , not suspecting that Oscar had long before reached a peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Sooner that he could not readp242letters on labels when they were dancing and sashaying , forwardand back , dos-a-dos , and all hands around . So he took a bottle gravely , handed it to Doc , and went on his way . For such a fastidious man as Oscar , life in one of the generalbunkhouses must have been somewhat of an ordeal , but he was proud and pigheaded , like all Scandinavians , and because he worked as a carpenter 's helper , would not accept quarters or privileges not open to all the carpenter 's helpers . That , of course , did not stop him from calling on his friends who thought more of being comfortable than correct . In a bunkhouse , under mid-winter conditions such as those in Jackson Hole , the air got thick , snores , groans and other physiological manifestations which are semi-involuntary , swelled the sound effects , the light of old-fashioned coal oil lanterns was as dingy as kerosene fumes are malodorous . So men asleep bother those who are awake , and vice versa . Oscar decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evening in music , strong waters and sociable riot . We played , talked and drank so late that Oscar , when the time came to go to bed , was already asleep . Rather than to disturb him to ask him to stay , we took off his boots , put his violin away as carefully as we could , lugged him to an extra bed , covered him with blankets , and let it go at that . Early next morning , while it was still dark  --  our daylight hours then were from seven until five  --  Oscar woke me , apologetically , and as my mind cleared , somewhat , I realized that he was deeply worried . We dressed , thawed out the bucket , washed and heated up some coffee while Wise lay corpselike and motionless . After the first puff of his morning cigarette , one he made with Bull Durham , Oscar began telling me what was on his mind . He had been awake an hour , and strangememories had been emerging from the mist that had envelopedhis mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was always lurking somewhere near the surface of Oscar 's consciousness . He groped for a while , not knowing what top243say , or what would be behind what he would say , then stood erect , paled , and caught his breath . " By God ! I must'a really done it , " he said . I shrugged . There were so many thing a man could do , and most of them could not be accomplished in camp . My lack of response pained Oscar . " This is terrible , " he said , in the manner of a man who , conscious of guilt , is about to plead guilty . " Colonel R. E. Morse , " I suggested . " Skeet . How did I get here last night ? " he asked . In spite of the fact that I knew Oscar so well , and had been with him so often when he had been drinking , I was astonishedfor a moment . He had appeared at the cabin door about ten or ten-thirty o'clock , asked politely if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him . He played with unusual seriousness , both in his selections from the classics and his scholarly delivery . That should have been my clue . While we were talking he had taken part in the conversation carefully and formally . Another clue . It is easy to see signs like that in retrospect . Then he had suddenly gone fast asleep , without preliminaries . In a polite man like Oscar , that was the most significant lapse of all . I must have been a little tight myself to have been so unobservant . In the lamp-lit darkness of the winter morning , warmed on one side by the fire and cold on the other  --  the cabin warmed up slowly  --  I still could find incongruous aspects in the situation . Oscar always took risks without a quaver , and whatever he did , he accepted the consequences without whining . Furthermore , he had been in the hospital and , presumably , had come directly from there , for he had been bearing signed blanks for Wise to have filled out in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should end in removing Oscar from the government workmen 's compensationlist to the regular payroll . How could a man get sop244plastered in a small hospital like Doc 's that he could not remember what had happened ? " Before I show up , outdoors , " Oscar said , anxiously , " you 'll have to do some missionary work . " " All right , " I agreed . " Find out about Sooner , " Oscar said . " Now , Oscar , " I objected , " you ca n't get away with any monkey-business there . " In his condition , the suggestion of mauling and enticing poor Sooner caused him to double up and suffer the dry heaves . " Please , " he begged . " This is serious . " " What shall I find out about Sooner , and how ? Shall I ask her questions , or pump her husband ? " I was completely in the fog . Then Oscar explained that he had mislaid his memory some time before he left Doc 's office and , awakening suddenly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rafters , a horrid recollection had returned to him all too clearly . But it was an isolated fragment , and the rest of the picture was lost . " I was standing in the doorway , near those shelves with bottles on them , " he said . " Doc was there " ( he motioned to his right ) " and Sooner was sitting in the chair by the desk . Doc was mixing up some stuff for her . . . to stop cold sweats and hot flushes . . . " " Sooner must be a honey when she 's hot , stripped , wet and cold all at once , " I said , and Oscar doubled up again , and begged with his eyes . He looked reproachful and continued . " Let me tell you this . We 've got to do something quick . . . Doc says to me , Hand me down the bottle of sweet spirits of nitre . ' The bottles were right handy to where I was standing , but Doc did n't know I could n't read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters on the labels danced back and forth , forward and back , and round and round . "  |p245I  began to understand that the situation had possibilities beyond the humorous , and looked grave myself . " You got the wrong one ? " I asked . " Which one ? " " God-damned if I know , " he admitted . " Doc did n't notice ? " I asked , more anxiously . " You 've got me . If he did , he did n't say anything . " I paused to rearrange my thoughts . " How do you know itwas the wrong one , if you ca n't remember anything ? " I asked . Oscar 's reply was positive and calmer . " I saw those letters dancing again , in the middle of the night , just like they did in the hospital , " he said . " Look , " I said , exasperated , " do you mean to say that lettersyou could n't read in the evening you could read , later , in the dark , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not exactly , " Oscar said , and held up his delicate hand to postpone my interruption . " But the dance I saw in the night had two words in it , not four . Sweet spirits of nitre has four , and would do a different kind of dance , with three fair-sized sets ( like a square dance ) and a short one . The two I saw last night were longer and both about the same . Maybe the first had a couple more letters . " " Christ ! " I said . " See if Sooner 's all right , will you please , and if she is , tell her for God 's sake not to swallow any of that medicine , " Oscar implored . As a friend should , I got into action . I slipped on more woolen socks and my overshoes , some overalls over my corduroys , a sweater and a leather vest , black silk gloves , and over them , buckskin mittens . But as I was about to open the door and glance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern with somewhat less than his usual precision  --  I stopped . " Why not go straight to Doc ? " I asked . " You ought to come along . Maybe you 'll recognize the bottle you handed him , ifp246you see it face to face . There ca n't be many labels with two words , the first one a little longer than the other . " That was wishful thinking , of course , but I wanted to cheer him . Oscar started to dress . " See Sooner first , to ease my mind , and I 'll meet you in Doc 's office , " he said . So I set out in the brisk morning air  --  the thermometer had said 42 below  --  and saw that the Kulmus shack was alight and that shadows on the plain window shades ( Montgomery Ward KK-365oI ) indicated that Ross , the husband , was astir and that Sooner was not . Early other mornings , the reverse had been true in the Kulmus shack . Sooner got up , built the fire , cooked breakfast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry , mf , mezzo-forte , whereas before I had been slightly disturbed , p , piano . It is easy to understand that I felt foolish as well as perturbedwhen I tapped on the door and asked the astonished skinner how his wife was . Among the honest folk who drove teams and kept shacks , in those days , the change of life was not considered dangerous enough to warrant the issuing of bulletins , and , furthermore , was held to be a delicate matter and not for public discussion . But Ross did not resent my curiosity . On the contrary , he was intensely relieved . He had seen me helping Doc and thought of me as a " half-way doctor . " " I wish you 'd step in and take a look at her . She 's having cramps and twitches , and looks kinda green . I could n't sleep much , all night , " Ross said . Reluctantly , and with my heart beating fast , I took five steps to Sooner 's bunkside . She groaned , and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job that normallycould not be managed by just one person  --  and at the same time made motions of hiding her wide crooked mouthp247with both horny hands . I pretended to take her pulse , which I could n't find . " Mmmmm , " I said . " You 'd better ask Doc to drop in . " " I hate to do that , because he wo n't charge us nothing , " said Ross . " I 'm going over toward the hospital . I 'll ask him myself , " I said , and Ross thanked me while Sooner rumbled and groaned . I went out in the cold again , dreading to face Oscar and Doc , but when I got to the hospital I found Oscar there , with a Bohunk , Milo Strpovich , an ambulant patient . Oscar was pale as chalk , and his hands were trembling . I looked at him significantly , then at the rows of bottles on the shelves . " How is she ? " he asked , fearfully . " In bad shape , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not terrible . . . just bad , " I said . " Jesus ! " gasped Oscar . " At least , she 's alive . " Then he told me that Doc and Johanna had been called away to Jackson , for an emergency . That was the hour chosen by the Creator for the last year 's Jackson schoolteacher to have another baby . By that time I felt as bad as Oscar or Sooner did . I was thinking of Doe 's reputation , and how fine it was , and what would be said around camp if he had blundered with one of the humblest , most helpless of our people , while engineers , superintendents , foremen and pencil-stiffs were all in A-i shape . I sent Milo Strpovich over to wake Wise , always a memorable assignment for anyone , not because Wise could be of help but in order to get rid of Milo and talk with Oscar privately . " Which bottle ? " I asked . Without hesitation , but with pitiable trepidation , Oscar reached to the shelf , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits of nitre , and handed it to me . I read the label :  | " William 's Mixture . " In the words of Omar 's protagonist , " I left by the same door that in I went . " " William , " whoever he might be , struck no responsive chord in my scantily furnished mind . I removed the glass stopper and , after sniffing , was sure that one of the ingredients was camphor , and that there were others I could not identify . Camphor , in my limited experience , had always been used externally . First I hustled back to the Kulmus shack , where I burst in unceremoniously to find Sooner on the pot . Oh , that Goya could have immortalized that sight . Trying to make believe I was not seeing her , although she did not seem to mind my presence very much , I snatched the bottle of medicine from the table and , bowing an apology , took it with me to the doorway . " Doc needs a dose of this for someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ran to the hospital . In the office , I sniffed Sooner 's medicine , but you know how it is when you get the smell of camphor in your nostrils . It seems to linger there . I sniffed sweet spirits of nitre , then Sooner 's bottle , then camphor , until I could not have smelled a dead rat and be sure what it was . " William 's Mixture , " I repeated , half-aloud . " What the hell is that ? " Oscar asked . " William is a reliable-sounding name , " I said . " It does n't sound like poison . " With a motion as neat as the sweep of his bow arm , Oscar took the bottle from my hands and drank half of it before I could stop him . " By God , we 'll know now if it 's poison , " he said . He had not made allowance for the state of his stomach , after whiskey galore and a few hours of private Gethsemane . He made a dive for the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which received it enigmatically . Like the stern man hep249was , he tried the draft again , with the same inconclusive result . " Hell , " he said . " I ca n't hold it down . " To show I was not a quitter , I took a small swallow myself , and held it down , but at once I felt queer , and then actively miserable . But I did not totter , see spots , get dizzy or feel anything but a mildly nauseating and burning sensation which I could support but not enjoy or recommend . William 's Mixture . It was not marked " Poison , " but neither was it labeled " Non-Poisonous . " Kurt Mook or Doc Puckett , who might have been able to tell us about it , were in Ashton , and there was no telephone . Steve Dimitrios , who might have found an educated Bohunk in our gang  --  there were a few with various degrees who could make a quicker fortune shoveling in America than teaching or following a profession in their native land  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high on the hillside by the powder house . Doc was miles distance , and had with him the only trained nurse , who , because of her short legs , used to ski well behind him and drop back farther with each stroke . I got out the big book and read about " Camphor . " It turned out to be a solid , volatile oil obtained from Cinnamomumcamphora , a tree indigenous to Eastern Asia . The tree yielded camphoric and camphonic acids , also camphor cymol when exposed to a high heat in closed vessels . It was , according to the compiler and editor of the medical tome , antispasmodic , anodyne , diaphoretic and stimulant . Whatever the savants believed , it was not stimulant that morning for me . It was not antispasmodic , either . It caused my stomach to twitch like an expiring mackerel , and it depressedmy spirits almost down to absolute zero . That it was used in cholera did not help , either , but I got the general idea from the article in the book that it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions.  |p250There  were not many books of any kind in camp , but Doc had a dictionary of medical biography and although there were plenty of parties named Williams , none was called just plain William . Could the final " s " have been omitted in typing ? Doc typed badly , and Johanna Waldron not at all . The morning wore on . I called on Sooner again and found her back in bed , but someone , probably Ross , had moved the heavy bunk so that , from it , she could reach the open box in which were groceries and the shelf on which were simple condiments , also the Sibley stove with patent oven attached ( Montgomery Ward #SeX999-la ) so that Sooner was dividing her time among the pot , washstand ( also within reach ) , stove , table and was preparing Ross 's noonday meal . My sense of chivalry prompted me to take the thunder mug , at full arm 's length and dump the contents , all except one small ripe sampleI spooned into a thick paper bag for Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where everything froze solid before I could get back to the shack . Oscar paced , murmured , stood around wanting to help , and watching for Doc 's return . Meanwhile Sooner lost weight at a rate that would have done credit to a she-elephant . At last Doc came back , announced that the Jackson exschoolmarmhad been delivered of a girl which the jovial guides had already , in the presence of the pale young mother ( 32 ) , announced outrageous designs upon . He grinned and told Oscar , without prompting , that the latter had handed him the wrong bottle the evening before , but Doc had noticed and replaced it with the right one . Oscar did not say a word . He could not . He thanked Doc courteously , apologized restrainedly , and lit out for my cabin , where the Blackstone was stored beneath the rustic beds . Later , Reclamation circles in Washington were confused becausenine days elapsed between a certain rough-carpenter 's discharge from the hospital at " spatiate , " or Jackson Lake , and the rough-carpenter 's resumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports indicated that there was no place the said employee could have gone , for recreation and recovery , or to gratify a whim . Letters were exchanged that were long on the westbound side and brief when eastbound . For Oscar spent those nine days and nights in a land from which some travelers return , while others do not . Those who come back are never quite the same . They have enjoyed the shelter of a rock in a weary expanse , the only essential region which man may explore and is denied the lower animals , unless the latter appear in the lavish decor . He started out purposefully from Doc 's little office that cold afternoon after hearing me say to Doc : " But , Doc , she 's had movements which amount to a major retreat , in which impediments are recklessly abandoned . Is that all right ? " " I hope to kiss a pig , " said Doc Shaw , smiling . " And who is William , who invented the mixture ? " I asked . " A drug clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a fine eyewash , a little camphor and boracic acid dissolved in water . I keep it on hand for Torrance 's weak eyes . " At once my stomach stopped hurting and I breathed freely again , but I paid my silent respects to the author of the proverb which begins : " A little learning is a dangerous thing . " **26;7589;TOOLONG smoke-colored eyes I had ever seen , under long silky lashes . His features were delicate and perfect without being weak . His nose was straight and almost but not quite thin , his mouth was a handsome pout , there was a dimple in his chin , and his small ears nestled gracefully against his head . His skin had that heavy pallor which the sun never touches . He struck an attitude with his left hand on a hip and his right made a graceful curve in the air . " Greetings , " he said . " Lovely day , is n't it ? " " Pretty hot in here for me . " " I like it hot . " The statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked was beneath his notice . He sat down on a step , produced a long file from somewhere , and began to file his fingernails . " You from the bank ? " he asked without looking up . " I 'm looking for Dr. Verringer . " He stopped working with the file and looked off into the warm distance . " Who 's he ? " he asked with no possible interest . " He owns the place . Laconic as hell , are n't you ? As if you did n't know . " He went back to his file and fingernails . " You got told wrong , sweetie . The bank owns the place . They done foreclosed it or it 's in escrow or something . I forget the details . " He looked up at me with the expression of a man to whom de- tails mean nothing . I got out of the Olds and leaned against the hot door , then I moved away from that to where there was some air . " Which bank would that be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from there . You do n't come from there , you do n't have any business here . Flit the trail , sweetie . Buzz off but fast . " " I have to find Dr. Verringer . " " The joint 's not operating , sweetie . Like it says on the sign , this is a private road . Some gopher forgot to lock the gate . " " You the caretaker ? " " Sort of . Do n't ask any more questions , sweetie . My temper 's not reliable . " " What do you do when you get mad  --  dance a tango with a ground squirrel ? "  | He stood up suddenly and gracefully . He smiled a minute , an empty smile . " Looks like I got to toss you back in your little old convertible , " he said. convertible , " he said . " Later . Where would I find Dr. Verringer about now ? " He pocketed his file in his shirt and something else took its place in his right hand . A brief motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The skin over his cheekbones was tighter and there was a flame deep in his large smoky eyes . He strolled towards me . I stepped back to get more room . He went on whistling but the whistle was high and shrill . " We do n't have to fight , " I told him . " We do n't have anything to fight about . And you might split , those lovely britches . " He was as quick as a flash . He came at me with a smooth leap and his left hand snaked out very fast . I expected a jab and moved my head well enough but what he wanted was my right wrist and my head well enough but what he wanted was my right wrist and he got it . He had a grip too . He jerked me off balance and the hand with the brass knucks came around in a looping bolo punch . A crack on the back of the head with those and I would be a sick man . If I pulled he would catch me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm below the point of the shoulder . It would have been a dead arm or a dead face , whichever it happened to be . In a spot like that there is only one thing to do . I went with the pull . In passing I blocked his left foot from behind , grabbed his shirt and heard it tear . Something hit me on the back of the neck , but it was n't the metal . I spun to the left and he went over sideways and landed catlike and was on his feet again before I had any kind of balance . He was grinning now . He was delighted with everything . He loved his work . He came for me fast . A strong beefy voice yelled from somewhere : " Earl ! Stop that at once ! At once , do you hear me ? " The gaucho boy stopped . There was a sort of sick grin on his face . He made a quick motion and the brass knucks disappeared into the wide sash around the top of his pants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Hawaiian shirt hurrying towards us down one of the paths waving his arms . He came up breathing a little fast . " Are you crazy , Earl ? " " Do n't ever say that , Doc , " Earl said softly . Then he smiled , turned away , and went to sit on the steps of the house . He took off the flat-crowned hat , produced a comb , and began to comb his thick dark hair with an absent expression . In a second or two he started to whistle softly . The heavy man in the loud shirt stood and looked at me . I stood and looked at him . . " What 's going on here ? " he growled . " Who are you , sir ? " " Name 's Marlowe . I was asking for Dr. Verringer . The lad you % call Earl wanted to play games . I figure it 's too hot . " " I am Dr. Verringer , " he said with dignity . He turned his head . " Go in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave Dr. Verringer a thoughtful study- ing look , his large smoky eyes blank of expression . Then he went up the steps and pulled the screen door open . A cloud of flies buzzed angrily and then settled on the screen again as the door closed . " Marlowe ? " Dr. Verringer gave me his attention again . " And what can I do for you , Mr. Marlowe ? " " Earl says you are out of business here . " " That is correct . I am just waiting for certain legal formalities before moving out . Earl and I are alone here . " " " I 'm disappointed , " I said , looking disappointed . " I thought you had a man named Wade staying with you . " He hoisted a couple of eyebrows that would have interested a Fuller Brush man . " Wade ? I might possibly know somebody of that name  --  it 's a common enough name  --  but why should he be staying with me ? " " Taking the cure . " He frowned . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a frown . " I am a medical man , sir , but no longer in practice . What sort of cure did you have in mind ? " " The guy 's a wino . He goes off his rocker from time to time and disappears . Sometimes he comes home under his own power , sometimes he gets brought home , and sometimes he takes a bit of finding . " I got a business card out and handed it to him . He read it with no pleasure.  |p102|p102| " What goes with Earl ? " I asked him . " He think he 's Valentino or something ? " He made with the eyebrows again . They fascinated me . Parts of them curled off all by themselves as much as an inch and a half . He shrugged his meaty shoulders " Earl is quite harmless , Mr. Marlowe . He is  --  at times  --  a little dreamy . Lives in a play world , shall we say ? " " You say it , Doc . From where I stand he plays rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You exaggerate surely . Earl likes to dress himself up . He is childlike in that respect . " " You mean he 's a nut , " I said . " This place some kind of sani- tarium , is n't it ? Or was ? " " Certainly not . When it was in operation it was an artists ' colony . I provided meals , lodging , facilities for exercise and enter- tainment , and above all seclusion . And for moderate fees . Artists , as you probably know , are seldom wealthy people . In the term artists I of course include writers , musicians , and so on . It was a rewarding occupation for me  --  while it lasted . " He looked sad when he said this . The eyebrows drooped at the outer corners to match his mouth . Give them a little more growth and they would be in his mouth . " I know that , " I said . " It 's in the file . Also the suicide you had here a while back . A dope case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bristled . " What file ? " he asked sharply . " We 've got a file on what we call the barred-window boys , Doc- tor . Places where you ca n't jump out of when the French fits take over . Small private sanitariums or what have you that treat alcoholics and dopers and mild cases of mania . " " Such places must be licensed by law , " Dr. Verringer said harshly . " Yeah . In theory anyway . Sometimes they kind of forget about that . " He drew himself up stiffly . The guy had a kind of dignity , at that . " The suggestion is insulting , Mr. Marlowe . I have no knowl- edge of why my name should be on any such list as you mention . I must ask you to leave . " " Let 's get back to Wade . Could he be here under another name , maybe ? "  | " There is no one here but Earl and myself . We are quite alone . Now if you will excuse me  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get them mad enough to say something off key . But not Dr. Verringer . he remained dignified . His eyebrows went all the way with him . I looked towards the house . From inside there came a sound of music , dance music . And very faintly the snapping of fingers . " I bet he 's in there dancing , " I said . " That 's a tango . I bet you he 's dancing all by himself in there . Some kid . " " Are you going to leave , Mr. Marlowe ? Or shall I have to ask Earl to assist me in putting you off my property ? " " Okay , I 'll leave . No hard feelings , Doctor . There were only three names beginning with V and you seemed the most promising of them . That 's the only real clue we had  --  Dr. V. He scrawled it on a piece of paper before lie left : Dr. V. " " There must be dozens , " Dr. Verringer said evenly . " Oh sure . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks for the time , Doctor . Earl bothers me a little . " I turned and went over to my car and got into it . By the time I had the door shut Dr. Verringer was beside me . He leaned in with a pleasant expression . " We need not quarrel , Mr. Marlowe . I realize that in your oc- cupation you often have to be rather intrusive . Just what bothers you about Earl ? " " He 's so obviously a phony . Where you find one thing phony you 're apt to expect others . The guy 's a manic-depressive , is n't he ? Right now he 's on the upswing . " He stared at me in silence . He looked grave and polite . " Many interesting and talented people have stayed with me , Mr. Marlowe . Not all of them were as level-headed as you may be . Talented people are often neurotic . But I have no facilities for the care of lunatics or alcoholics , even if I had the taste for that sort of work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly the type to care for the sick . " " Just what would say he is the type for , Doctor ? Apart from bubble-dancing and stuff ? " He leaned on the door . His voice got low and confidential.  | " Earl 's parents were dear friends of mine , Mr. Marlowe . Some- one has to look after Earl and they are no longer with us . Earl has to live a quiet life , away from the noise and temptations of the city . He is unstable but fundamentally harmless . I control him with absolute ease , as you saw . " " You 've got a lot of courage , " I said . He sighed . His eyebrows waved gently , like the antennae of some suspicious insect . " It has been a sacrifice , " he said . " A ratherheavy one . I thought Earl could help me with my work here . He plays beautiful tennis , swims and dives like a champion , and can dance all night . Almost always he is amiability itself . But from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved a broad hand as if pushing painful memories into the background . " In the end it was either give up Earl or give up my place here . " He held both hands palms up , spread them apart , turned them over and let them fall to his sides . His eyes looked moist with unshed tears . " I sold out , " he said . " This peaceful little valley will become a real estate development . There will be sidewalks and lampposts and children with scooters and blatting radios . There will even "  --  he heaved a forlorn sigh  --  " be Television . " He waved his hand in a sweeping gesture . " I hope they will spare the trees , " he said , " but I 'm afraid they wo n't . Along the ridges there will be tele- vision aerials instead . But Earl and I will be far away , I trust . " " Goodbye , Doctor . My heart bleeds for you . " He put out his hand . It was moist but very firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marlowe . And I regret I am unable to help you in your , quest for Mr. Slade . " " Wade , " I said . " Pardon me , Wade , of course . Goodbye and good luck , sir . " I started up and drove back along the graveled road by the way I had come . I felt sad , but not quite as sad as Dr. Verringer would have liked me to feel . I came out through the gates and drove far enough around the curve of the highway to park out of sight of the entrance . I got out and walked back along the edge of the paving to where I could just see the gates from the barbed-wire boundary fence . I stood there under a eucalyptus and waited.  | Five minutes or so passed . Then a car came down the private road churning gravel . It stopped out of sight from where I was . I pulled back still farther into the brush . I heard a creaking noise , then the click of a heavy catch and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the car went back up the road . When the sound of it had died I went back to my Olds and did a U turn to face back towards town . As I drove past the entrance to Dr. Verringer 's private road I saw that the gate was fastened with a padlocked chain . No more visitors today , thank you . I DROVE THE TWENTY-ODD Miles back to town and ate lunch . While I ate I felt more and more silly over the whole deal . You just do n't find people the way I was going about it . You meet inter- esting characters like Earl and Dr. Verringer , but you do n't meet the man you are looking for . You waste tires , gasoline , words , and nervous energy in a game with no pay-off . You 're not even bet- ting table limit four ways on Black 28 . With three names that started with V , I had as much chance of paging my man as I had of breaking Nick the Greek in a crap game . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a promising lead that blows up in your face with no music . But he should n't have said Slade instead of Wade . lie was an intelligent man . He Maybe , and maybe not . It had not been a long acquaintance . Over my coffee I thought about Drs . Vukanich and Varley . Yes or would n't forget that easy , and if he did he would just forget. no ? They would kill most of the afternoon . By then I could call the Wade mansion in Idle Valley and be told the head of the house- hold had returned to his domicile and all was gleaming bright for the time being . Dr. Vukanich was easy . He was only half a dozen blocks downp107the line . But Dr. Varley was away to hell and gone in the Altadena hills , a long , hot , boring drive . Yes or no ? The final answer was yes . For three good reasons . One was that you can never know too much about the shadow line and the people who walk it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file Peters had got out for me was just that much thanks and goodwill . The third reason was that I did n't have anything else to do . I paid my check , left my car where it was , and walked the north side of the street to the Stockwell Building . It was an antique with a cigar counter in the entrance and a manually operated ele- vator that lurched and hated to level off . The corridor of the sixth floor was narrow and the doors had frosted glass panels . It was older and much dirtier than my own building . It was loaded with doctors , dentists , Christian Science practitioners not doing too good , the kind of lawyers you hope the other fellow has , the kind of doctors and dentists who just scrape along . Not too skillful , not too clean , not too much on the ball , three dollars and please pay the nurse ; tired , discouraged men who know just exactly where they stand , what kind of patients they can get and how much money they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Credit . Doctor is In , Doctor is Out . That 's a pretty shaky molar you have there , Mrs. Kazinski . Now if you want this new acrylic filling , every bit as good as a gold inlay , I can do it for you for $14 . Novocain will be two dollars extra , if you wish it . Doctor is In , Doctor is Out . That will be Three Dollars . Please Pay the Nurse . In a building like that there will always be a few guys making real money , but they do n't look it . They fit into the shabby back- ground , which is protective coloring for them . Shyster lawyers who are partners in a bail-bond racket on the side ( only about two per cent of all forfeited bail bonds are ever collected ) . Abortionists posing as anything you like that explains their funishings . Dope pushers posing as urologists , dermatologists , or any branch of medicine in which the treatment can be frequent , and the regular use of local anesthetics is normal . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which there were a dozen people , all uncomfortable . They looked like anybody else . They had no signs on them . Anywayp108you ca n't tell a doper well under control from a vegetarian book- keeper . I had to wait three quarters of an hour . The patients went in through two doors . An active ear , nose , and throat man can handle four sufferers at once , if he has enough room . Finally I got in . I got to sit in a brown leather chair beside a table covered with a white towel on which was a set of tools . A sterilizing cabinet bubbled against the wall . Dr. Vukanich came in briskly with his white smock and his round mirror strapped to his forehead . He sat down in front of me on a stool . " A sinus headache , is it ? Very severe ? " He looked at a folder the nurse had given him . I said it was awful . Blinding . Especially when I first got up in the morning . He nodded sagely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap over a thing thatlooked like a fountain pen . He pushed it into my mouth . " Close the lips but not the teeth , please . " While he said it he reached out and switched off the light . There was no window . A ventilating fan purred somewhere . Dr. Vukanich withdrew his glass tube and put the lights back up . He looked at me carefully . " No congestion at all , Mr. Marlowe . If you have a headache , it is not from a sinus condition . I 'd hazard a guess that you never had sinus trouble in your lift . You had a septum operation some- time in the past , I see . " " Yes , Doctor . Got a kick playing football . " He nodded . " There is a slight shelf of bone which should have been cut away . Hardly enough to interfere with breathing , how- ever . " He leaned back on the stool and held his knee . " Just what did with an uninteresting pallor . He looked like a tubercular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . He was a thin-faced man " I wanted to talk to you about a friend of mine . He 's in bad shape . He 's a writer . Plenty of dough , but bad nerves . Needs help . He lives on the sauce for days on end . He needs that little extra something . His own doctor wo n't co-operate any more . " " Exactly what do you mean by co-operate ? " Dr. Vukanich asked . " All the guy needs is an occasional shot to calm him down . Ip109thought maybe we could work something out . The money would be solid . " " Sorry , Mr. Marlowe . It is not my sort of problem . " He stood up . " Rather a crude approach , if I may say so . Your friend may consult me , if he chooses . But he 'd better have something wrong with him that requires treatment . That will be ten dollars , Mr. Marlowe . " " Come off it , Doc . You 're on the list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . I gave him Dr. Vukanich leaned against the wall and lit a cigarette . He wasone of my cards to look at instead . He looked at it . " What list would that be ? " he inquired . " The barred-window boys . I figure you might know my friend already . His name 's Wade . I figure you might have him stashed away somewhere in a little white room . The guy is missing from home . " " You are an ass , " Dr. Vukanich told me . " I do n't go in for penny ante stuff like four-day liquor cures . They cure nothing in any case . I have no little white rooms and I am not acquainted with the friend you mention  --  even if he exists . That will be ten dollars  --  cash  --  right now . Or would you rather I called the police and make a complaint that you solicited me for narcotics ? " " That would be dandy , " I said . " Let's. " "  --  Get out of here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . " I guess I made a mistake , Doctor . The last time the guy broke parole he holed up with a doctor whose name began with V. It was strictly an undercover operation . They fetched him late at night and brought him back the same way when he was over the jumps . Did n't even wait long enough to see him go in the house . So when he hops the coop again and do n't come back for quite a piece , naturally we check over our files for a lead . We come up with three doctors whose names be- gin with V. " " Interesting , " he said with a bleak smile . He was still giving me time . " What is the basis of your selection ? " I stared at him . His right hand was moving softly up and down the upper part of his left arm on the inside of it . His face was covered with a light sweat.  | " Sorry , Doctor . We operate very confidential . " " Excuse me a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of it hanging in the air and went out . While he was gone a nurse poked her head through the doorway , looked at me briefly and withdrew . Then Dr. Vukanich came back in strolling happily . He was smiling and relaxed . His eyes were bright . " What ? Are you still here ? " He looked very surprised or pre- tended to . " I thought our little visit had been brought to an end . " " I 'm leaving . I thought you wanted me to wait . " He chuckled . " You know something , Mr. Marlowe ? We live in extraordinary times . For a mere five hundred dollars I could have you put in the hospital with several broken bones . Comical , is n't it ? " " Hilarious , " I said . " Shoot yourself in the vein , do n't you , Doc ? Boy , do you brighten up ! " I started out . " Hasta luego , amigo , " he chirped . " Do n't forget my ten bucks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was speaking into it as I left . In the waiting room the same twelve people or twelve just like them were being uncomfortable . The nurse was right on the job . " That will be ten dollars , please , Mr. Marlowe . This office re- quires immediate cash payment . " I stepped among the crowded feet to the door . She bounded out of her chair and ran around the desk . I pulled the door open . " What happens when you do n't get it ? " I asked her . " You 'll find out what happens , " she said angrily . " Sure . You 're just doing your job . So am I. Take a gander at the card I left and you 'll see what my job is . " I went on out . The waiting patients looked at me with disap- proving eyes . That was no way to treat Doctor.  | DR . AMOS VARLEY was a very different proposition . He had a big old house in a big old garden with big old oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with elaborate scrollwork along the overhang of the porches and the white porch railings had turned and fluted uprights like the legs of an old-fashioned grand piano . A few frail elderly people sat in long chairs on the porches with rugs tucked around them . The entrance doors were double and had stained-glass panels . The hall inside was wide and cool and the parquetry floor was polished and without a single rug . Altadena is a hot place in summer . It is pushed back against the hills and the breeze jumps clear over it . Eighty years ago people knew how to build houses for this climate . Varley condescended to see me . He was a big bald-headed guy with A nurse in crisp white took my card and after a wait Dr. Amos a cheery smile . His long white coat was spotless , he walked noise- lessly on crepe rubber soles .

" " Not the way I heard it , " 1 said . " I guess I heard it wrong . " " And how did you hear it , Mr. Marlowe ? " He was still giving me the full treatment with his smile and his mellow tones .

No nickel grabber , Doctor . He rates way up . " " I shall give him a piece of my mind , " Dr. Varley said with cool distaste . " His name ? " The sun had set in Dr. Varley 's man- ner . It was getting to be a chilly evening . " Confidential , Doctor . But do n't give it a thought . All- in the day 's work . Name of Wade does n't ring a bell at all , huh ?

His eyes were closed , his skin had a bluish tinge . He was well wrapped up . The nurse wheeled him silently across the polished floor and out of a side door . Dr. Varley said softly : " Old people . Sick old people . Lonely old people . Do not come back , Mr. Marlowe . You might annoy me . When annoyedp113I can be rather unpleasant . I might even say very unpleasant . " " Okay by me , Doctor . Thanks for the time . Nice little dying- in home you got here . " " What was that ? " He took a step towards me and peeled off the remaining layers of honey . The soft lines of his face set them- selves into hard ridges . " What 's the matter ? " I asked him . " I can see my ' man would n't be here . I would n't look for anybody here that was n't too frail to fight back . Sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your- self , Doctor . Unwanted old people , but with money and hungry heirs .

Mine is an honorable branch of an honorable profession . " " Yeah . " I looked at him wearily . " I know it is . Only it smells of death . " He did n't slug me , so I walked away from him and out . I looked back from the wide double doors . He had n't moved . He had a job to do , putting back the layers of honey.  |p114I  DROVE BACK TO HOLLYWOOD feeling like a short length of chewed string . It was too early to eat , and too hot . I turned on the fan in my office . It did n't make the air any cooler , just a little morelively . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts stuck together like flies on flypaper . Three shots , three misses . All I had been doing was seeing too many doctors . I called the Wade home . A Mexican sort of accent answered and said that Mrs. Wade was not at home . I asked for Mr. Wade . The voice said Mr. Wade was not home either . I left my name . He seemed to catch it without any trouble . He said he was the houseboy . I called George Peters at The Carne Organization . Maybe he knew some more doctors . IIe was n't in . I left a phony name and a right telephone number . An hour crawled by like a sick cock- roach . I was a grain of sand on the desert of oblivion . I was a two-gun cowpoke fresh out of bullets . Three shots , three misses . I hate it when they come in threes . You call on Mr. A. Nothing . You call on Mr. B. Nothing . You call on Mr. C. More of the same . A week later you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know he existed and by the time you found out , the client had changed his mind and killed the investigation . Drs . Vukanich and Varley were scratched . Varley had it too rich to fool with hooch cases . Vukanich was a punk , a high-wire performer who hit the main line in his own office . The help must know . At least some of the patients must know . All it took to finish him was one sorehead and one telephone call . Wade would n't have gone within blocks of him , drunk or sober . He might not be the brightest guy in the world  --  plenty of successful people are far from mental giants  --  but he could n't be dumb enough to fool with Vukanich . The only possible was Dr. Vet-ringer . He had the space and the seclusion . He probably had the patience . But Sepulveda Canyon was a long way from Idle Valley . Where was the point of contact , how did they know each other , and if Verringer owned that prop- erty and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well heeled . That gave me an idea . I called a man I knew in a title company to find out the status of the property . No answer . The title company had closed for the day . I closed for the day too , and drove over to La Cienaga to Rudy 's Bar-B-Q , gave my name to the master of ceremonies , and waited for the big moment on a bar stool with a whiskey sour in front of me and Marek Weber 's waltz music in my cars . After a while I got in past the velvet rope and ate one of Rudy 's " world-famous " Salisbury steaks , which is hamburger on a slab of burnt wood , ringed with browned-over mashed potato , supported by fried onion rings and one of those mixed up salads which men will cat with complete docility in restaurants , although they would probably start yelling if their wives tried to feed them one at home . After that I drove home . As I opened the front door the phone started to ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted me to call you . " " Just to find out if anything had happened at your end . I have been seeing doctors all day and have made no friends . " " No , I 'm sorry . He still has n't showed up . I ca n't help being rather anxious . Then you have nothing to tell me , I suppose . " Her voice was low and dispirited . " It 's a big crowded county , Mrs. Wade . " " It will be four whole days tonight . " " Sure , but that 's not too long . " " For me it is . " She was silent for a while . " I 've been doing a lot of thinking , trying to remember something , " she went on . " There must be something , some kind of hint or memory . Roger talks a great deal about all sorts of things . " " Does the name Verringer mean anything to you , Mrs. Wade ? " " No , I 'm afraid not . Should it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home one time by a tall young man dressed in a cowboy outfit . Would you recog- nize this tall young man if you saw him again , Mrs. Wade ? " " I suppose I might , " she said hesitantly , " if the conditions werep116the same . But I only caught the merest glimpse of him . Was his name Verringer ? " " No , Mrs. Wade . Verringer is a heavily built , middle-aged man who runs , or more accurately has run , some kind of guest ranch in Sepulveda Canyon . He has a dressed up fancy boy named Earl working for him . And Verringer calls himself a doctor . " " That 's wonderful , " she said warmly . " Do n't you feel that you 're on the right track ? " " I could be wetter than a drowned kitten . I 'll call you when I know . I just wanted to make sure Roger had n't come home and that you had n't recalled anything definite . " " I 'm afraid I have n't been of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said I would do that and we hung up . I took a gun and a " Please call me at any time , no matter how late it is. " short-barreled .32 with flat-point cartridges . Dr. Verringer 's boy Earl might have other toys than brass knuckles . If he had , he was plenty goofy enough to play with them . I hit the highway again and drove as fast as I dared . It was a moonless night , and would be getting dark by the time I reached the entrance to Dr. Verringer 's estate . Darkness was what I needed . The gates were still locked with the chain and padlock . I drove on past and parked well off the highway . There was still some light under the trees but it would n't last long . I climbed the gatethree-cell flashlight with me this time . The gun was a tough little and went up the side of the hill looking for a hiking path . Far back in the valley I thought I heard a quail . A mourning dove exclaimed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path or I could n't find one , so 1 went back to the road and walked along the edge of the gravel . The eucalyptus trees gave way to the oaks and I crossed the ridge and far off I could see a few lights . It took me three quarters of an hour to work up behind the swimming pool and the tennis courts to a spot where I could look down on the main building at the end of the road . It was lighted up and I could hear music coming from it . And farther oil in the trees another cabin showed light . There were small dark cabins dotted all over the place in the trees . I went along a path now and suddenly a floodlight went on at the back of the main cabin . I stopped dead . The floodlight was not looking forp117anything . It pointed straight down and made a wide pool of light on the back porch and the ground beyond . Then a door banged open and Earl came out . Then I knew I was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been a cowpoke who brought Roger Wade home the time before . Earl was spinning a rope . He wore a dark shirt stitched with white and a polka-dot scarf knotted loosely around his neck . He wore a wide leather belt with a load of silver on it and a pair of tooled leather hol- sters with ivory-handled guns in them . He wore elegant riding pants and boots cross-stitched in white and glistening new . On the back of his head was a white sombrero and what looked like a woven silver cord hanging loosely down his shirt , the ends not fastened . He stood there alone under the white floodlight , spinning his rope around him , stepping in and out of it , an actor without an audience , a tall , slender , handsome dude wrangler putting on a show all by himself and loving every minute of it . Two-Gun Earl , the Terror of Cochise County . He belonged on one of those guest ranches that are so all-fired horsy the telephone girl wears riding boots to work . All at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rope dropped , his hands swept the two guns from the holsters , and the crook of his thumbs was over the hammers as they came level . Ile peered into the darkness . I did n't dare move . The damn guns could be loaded . But the floodlight had blinded him and he did n't see anything . He slipped his guns back in the holsters , picked up the rope and gathered it loosely , went back into the house . The light went off , and so did I. I moved around through the trees and got close to the small lighted cabin on the slope . No sound came from it . I reached a screened window and looked in . The light came from a lamp on a night table beside a bed . A man lay flat on his back in the bed , his body relaxed , his arms in pajama sleeves outside the covers , his eyes wide open and staring at the ceiling . He looked big . His face was partly shadowed , but I could see that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed one for just about the right length of time . The spread fingers of his hands lay motionless on the outside of the bed . He looked as if he had n't moved for hours . I heard steps coming along the path at the far side of the cabin . A screen door creaked and then the solid shape of Dr. Verringer showed in the doorway . He was carrying what looked like a large glass of tomato juice . He switched on a standing lamp . His Ha- waiian shirt gleamed yellowly . The man in the bed did n't even look at him . Dr. Verringer put the glass down on the night table and pulled a chair close and sat down . He reached for one of the wrists and felt a pulse . " How are you feeling now , Mr. Wade ? " His voice was kindly and solicitous . The man on the bed did n't answer him or look at him . He went on staring at the ceiling . " Come , come , Mr. Wade . Let us not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are weak , but otherwise  --  " " Tejjy , " the man on the bed said suddenly , " tell the man that if he knows how I am , the son of a bitch need n't bother to ask me . " He had a nice clear voice , but the tone was bitter . " Who is Tejjy ? " Dr. Verringer asked patiently . " My mouthpiece . She 's up there in the corner . " Dr. Verringer looked up . " I see a small spider , " he said . " Stop acting , Mr. Wade . It is not necessary with inc . " " Tegenaria domestica , the common jumping spider , pal . I like spiders . They practically never wear Hawaiian shirts . " Dr. Verringer moistened his lips . " I have no time for playful- ness , Mr. Wade . " " Nothing playful about Tejjy . " Wade turned his head slowly , as if it weighed very heavy , and stared at Dr. Verringer contemp- tuously . " Tejjy is dead serious . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she makes a quick silent hop . After a while she 's near enough . She makes the last jump . You get sucked dry , Doctor . Very dry . Tejjy does n't eat you . She just sucks the juice until there 's nothing left but the skin . If you plan to wear that shirt much longer , Doctor , I 'd say it could n't happen too soon . " 1 ) r . Verringer leaned back in the chair . " I need five thousand dollars , " he said calmly . " How soon could that happen ? " " You got six hundred and fifty bucks , " Wade said nastily . " Asp119well as my loose change . How the hell much does it cost in this bordello ? " " Chicken feed , " Dr. Verringer said . " I told you my rates had gone up . " " You did n't say they had moved to Mount Wilson . " " Do n't fence with me , Wade , " Dr. Verringer said curtly . " You are in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con- fidence . " " I did n't know you had any . " Dr. Verringer tapped slowly on the arms of the chair . " You called me up in the middle of the night , " he said . " You were in a desperate condition . You said you would kill yourself if I didn'tcome . I did n't want to do it and you know why . I have no license to practice medicine in this state . I am trying to get rid of this property without losing it all . I have Earl to look after and he was about due for a bad spell . I told you it would cost you a lot of money . You still insisted and I went . I want live thousand dollars . " " I was foul with strong drink , " Wade said . " You ca n't hold a man to that kind of bargain . You 're damn well paid already . " " Also , " Dr. Verringer said slowly , " you mentioned my name to your wife . You told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised . " I did n't do anything of the sort , " he said . " I did n't even see her . She was asleep . " " Some other time then . A private detective has been here ask- ing about you . He could n't possibly have known where to come , unless he was told . I stalled him off , but he may collie back . dollars . " " You 're not the brightest guy in the world , are you , Doc ? If You have to go home , Mr. ' Wade . But first I want my five thousand my wife knew where I was , why would she need a detective ? She could have come herself  --  supposing she cared that much . She could have brought Candy , our houseboy . Candy would cut your Blue Boy into thin strips while Blue Boy was making up his mind what picture he was starring in today . " " You have a nasty tongue , Wade . And a nasty mind . " " I have a nasty five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You will write me a check , " Dr. Verringer said firmly . " Now ,  |p120at  once . Then you will get dressed and Earl will take you home . " " A check ? " Wade was almost laughing . " Sure I 'll give you a check . Fine . How will you cash it ? " Dr. Verringer smiled quietly . " You think you will stop payment , Mr. Wade . But you wo n't . I assure you that you wo n't . " " You fat crook ! " Wade yelled at him . Dr. Verringer shook his head . " In some things , yes . Not in all . I am a mixed character like most people . Earl will drive you home . " " Nix . That lad makes my skin crawl , " Wade said . Dr. Verringer stood up gently and reached over and patted the shoulder of the man on the bed . " ' I'o me Earl is quite harmless , Mr. Wade . I have ways of controlling him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl came through the door in his Roy Rogers outfit . Dr. Verringer turned smiling . " Keep that psycho away from me , " Wade yelled , showing fear for the first time . Earl put his hands on his ornamented belt . His face was deadpan . A light whistling noise came from between his teeth . He moved slowly into the room . " You should n't have said that , " Dr. Verringer said quickly , and turned towards Earl . " All right , Earl . I 'll handle Mr. Wade myself . I 'll help him get dressed while you bring the car up here as close tothe cabin as possible . Mr. Wade is quite weak . " " And he 's going to be a lot weaker , " Earl said in a whistling kind of voice . " Out of my way , fatso , " " Now , Earl " he reached out and grabbed the handsome young One word from me and --  " That was as far as he got . Earl jerked his arm loose and his right man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Camarillo , do you ? hand came up with a flash of metal . The armored fist crashed against Dr. Verringer 's jaw . He went down as if shot through the heart . The fall shook the cabin . I started running . I reached the door and yanked it open . Earl spun around , lean- ing forward a little , staring at me without recognition . There was a bubbling sound behind his lips . He started for me fast . I jerked the gun out and showed it to him . It meant nothing . Either his own guns were not loaded or he had forgotten all about them . The brass knuckles were all he needed . He kept coming . I fired through the open window across the bed . The crash of the gun in the small room seemed much louder than it should have been . Earl stopped dead . His head slewed around and he looked at the hole in the window screen . He looked back at me . Slowly his face came alive and he grinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get rid of the knucks , " I said , watching his eyes . He looked surprisingly down at his hand . Ile slipped the mauler off and threw it casually in the corner . " Now the gun belt , " I said . " Do n't touch the guns , just the buckle . " " They 're not loaded , " he said smiling . " Hell , they 're not even guns , just stage money . " " The belt . Hurry it . " He looked at the short-barreled .32 . " That a real one ? Oh sure it is . The screen . Yeah , the screen . " The man on the bed was n't on the bed any more . Ile was behind Earl . He reached swiftly and pulled one of the bright guns loose . Earl did n't like this . His face showed it . " Lay off him , " 1 said angrily . " Put that back where you got it . " " He 's right , " Wade said . " They 're cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol on the table . " Christ , I 'm as weak as a broken arm . " " Take the belt off , " I said for the third time . When you start something with a type like Earl you have to finish it . Keep it simple and do n't change your mind . He did it at last , quite amiably . Then , holding the belt , he walked over to the table and got his other gun and put it in the holster and put the belt right back on again . I let him do it . It was n't until then that he saw Dr. Verringer crumpled on the floor against the wall . He made a sound of concern , went quickly across the room into the bathroom , and came back with a glass jug of water . He dumped the water on Dr. Verringer 's head . Dr. Verringer sputtered and rolled over . Then he groaned . Then he clapped a hand to his jaw . Then he started to get up . Earl helped him . " Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing who it was . " " It 's all right , nothing broken , " Verringer said , waving him away.  | " Get the car up here , Earl . And do n't forget the key for the padlockdown below . " " Car up here , sure . Right away . Key for the padlock . I got it . Right away , Doc . " He went out of the room whistling . Wade was sitting on the side of the bed , looking shaky . " You the " Just asking around from people who know about these things , " dick he was talking about ? " he asked me . " How did you find me ? " I said . " If you want to get home , you might get clothes on . " Dr. Verringer was leaning against the wall , massaging his jaw . " I 'll help him , " he said thickly . " All 1 do is help people and all they do is kick me in the teeth . " " I know just how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left them to work at it . THE CAR WAS CLOSE BY when they came out , but Earl was gone . He had stopped the car , cut the lights , and walked back towards the big cabin without saying anything to me . He was still whistling , groping for some half-remembered tune . Wade climbed carefully into the back seat and I got in beside him . Dr. Verringer drove . If his jaw hurt badly and his head ached , he did n't show it or mention it . We went over the ridge and down to the end of the graveled drive . Earl had already been down and unlocked the gate and pulled it open . I told Verringer where my car was and he pulled up close to it . Wade got into it and sat silent , staring at nothing . Verringer got out and went round beside him . He spoke to Wade gently . " About my five thousand dollars , Mr. Wade . The check you promised me . " Wade slid down and rested his head on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " You promised it . I need it . " " Duress , the word is , Verringer , a threat of harm . I have pro- tection now . " " I fed and washed you , " Verringer persisted . " I came in the night . I protected you , I cured you  --  for the time being , at least . " " Not five grand worth , " Wade sneered . " You got plenty out of my pockets . " Verringer would n't let go . " I have a promise of a connection in Cuba , Mr. Wade . You are a rich man . You should help others in their need . I have Earl to look after . To avail myself of this oppor- tunity I need the money . I will pay it back in full . " I began to squirm . I wanted to smoke , but I was afraid it would make Wade sick . " Like hell you 'd pay it back , " Wade said wearily . " You wo n't live long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will kill you in your sleep . " Verringer stepped back . I could n't see his expression , but his voice hardened . " There are more unpleasant ways to die , " he said . " I think yours will be one of them . " He walked back to his car and got into it . He drove in through his gates and was gone . I backed and turned and headed towards the city . After a mile or two Wade muttered : " Why should 1 give that fat slob five thousand dollars ? " " No reason at all . " " Then why do I feel like a bastard for not giving it to him ? " " No reason at all . " He turned his head just enough to look at me . " He handled me like a baby , " Wade said . " He hardly left me alone for fear Earl would come in and beat me up . He took every dime I had in my pockets . " " You probably told him to . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " This is just a job to me . " Silence for a couple of miles more . We went past the fringe of one of the outlying suburbs . Wade spoke again . " Maybe I 'll give it to him . He 's broke . The property is fore- closed . He wo n't get a dime out of it . All on account of that psycho . Why does he do it ? "  | " I would n't know . " " I 'm a writer , " Wade said . " I 'm supposed to understand what makes people tick . I do n't understand one damn thing about anybody . " I turned over the pass and after a climb the lights of the valley spread out endlessly in front of us . We dipped down to the highway north and west that goes to Ventura . After a while we passed through Encino . I stopped for a light and looked up towards the lights high on the hill where the big houses were . In one of them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn-off is pretty close now , " Wade said . " Or do you know it ? " " I know it . " " By the way , you have n't told me your name . " " Philip Marlowe . " " Nice name . " His voice changed sharply , saying : " Wait a minute . You the guy that was mixed up with Lennox ? " " Yeah . " He was staring at me in the darkness of the car . We passed the last buildings on the main drag of Encino . " I knew her , " Wade said . " A little . Him I never saw . Queer business , that . The law boys gave you the rough edge , did n't they ? " I did n't answer him . " Maybe you do n't like to talk about it , " he said . " Could be . Why would it interest you ? " " Hell , I 'm a writer . It must be quite a story . " " Take tonight off . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Okay . You do n't like me . I get it . " We reached the turn-off and I swung the car into it and towards the low hills and the gap between them that was Idle Valley . " I do n't either like you or dislike you , " I said . " I do n't know you . Your wife asked me to find you and bring you home . When I deliver you at your house I 'm through . Why she picked on me I could n't say . Like I said , it 's just a job . " We turned the flank of a hill and hit a wider , more firmly paved road . He said his house was a mile farther on , on the right side . He told me the number , which I already knew . For a guy in his shape he was a pretty persistent talker.  | " How much is she paying you ? " he asked . " We did n't discuss it . " " Whatever it is , it 's not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a great job , chum . I was n't worth the trouble . " " That 's just the way you feel tonight . " He laughed . " You know something , Marlowe ? I could get to like you . You 're a bit of a bastard  --  like me . " We reached the house . It was a two-story over-all shingle house with a small pillared portico and a long lawn from the entrance to the portico . I pulled into the driveway and stopped close to the garage . " Can you make it without help ? " " Of course . " He got out of the car . " Are n't you coming in for a drink or something ? " " Not tonight , thanks ; I 'll wait here until you 're in the house . " He stood there breathing hard . " Okay , " he said shortly . He turned and walked carefully along a flagged path to the front door . He held on to a white pillar for a moment , then tried the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and light washed across the green lawn . There was a sudden flutter of voices . I started backing from the driveway , following the back-up light . Somebody called out . I looked and saw Eileen Wade standing in the open doorway . I kept going and she started to run . So I had to stop . I ut the lightsand got out of the car . When she came up I said : " I ought to have called you , but I was afraid to leave him . " " Of course . Did you have a lot of trouble ? " " Well  --  a little more than ringing a doorbell . " " Please come in the house and tell me all about it . " " He should be in bed . By tomorrow he 'll be as good as new . " " Candy will put him to bed , " she said . " Ile wo n't drink tonight , if that 's what you are thinking of . " " Never occurred to me . Goodnight , Mrs. Wade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a drink yourself ? " I lit a cigarette . It seemed like a couple of weeks since I had tasted tobacco . I drank in the smoke . " May I have just one puff ? "  |p126She  came close to me and I handed her the cigarette . She drew on it and coughed . She handed it back laughing . " Strictly an amateur , as you see . " " So you knew Sylvia Lennox , " I said . " Was that why you wanted to hire me ? " " I knew who ? " She sounded puzzled . " Sylvia Lennox . " I had the cigarette back now . I was eating it pretty fast . " Oh , " she said , startled . " That girl that was  --  murdered . No , I did n't know her personally . I knew who she was . Did n't I tell you that ? " " Sorry , I 'd forgotten just what you did tell me . " She was still standing there quietly , close to me , slim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The light from the open door touched the fringe of her hair and made it glow softly . " Why did you ask me if that had anything to do with my wanting to , as you put it , hire you ? " When I did n't answer at once she added , " Did Roger tell you he knew her ? " " He said something about the case when I told him my name . He did n't connect me with it immediately , then he did . He talked so damn much I do n't remember half of what he said . " " I see . I must go in , Mr. Marlowe , and see if my husband needs anything . And if you wo n't come in  --  " " I 'll leave this with you , " I said . I took hold of her and , pulled her towards me and tilted her head back . I kissed her hard on the lips . She did n't fight me and she did n't respond . She pulled herself away quietly and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that , " she said . " That was wrong . You 're too nice a person . " " Sure . Very wrong , " I agreed . " But I 've been such a nice faithful well-behaved gun dog all day long , I got charmed into one of the silliest ventures I ever tackled , and damned if it did n't turn out just as though somebody had written a script for it . You know some- thing ? I believe you knew where he was all along  --  or at least knew the name of Dr. Verringer . You just wanted to get me involved with him , tangled up with him so I 'd feel a sense of responsibility to look after him . Or am I crazy ? "  | " Of course you 're crazy , " she said coldly . " That is the most out- rageous nonsense I ever listened to . " She started to turn away . " Wait a minute , " I said . " That kiss wo n't leave a scar . You just think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice a person . I 'd rather be a heel . " She looked back . " Why ? " " If I had n't been a nice guy to Terry Lennox , he would still be alive . " " Yes ? " she said quietly . " How can you be so sure ? Goodnight , Mr. Marlowe . And thank you so very much for almost everything . " She walked back along the edge of the grass . 1 watched her into the house . The door closed . The porch light went off . I waved at nothing and drove away . NEXT MORNING I GOT UP LATE on account of the big fee 1 had earned the night before . I drank an extra cup of coffee , smoked an extra cigarette , ate an extra slice of Canadian bacon , and for the three hundredth time I swore I would never again use an electric razor . That made the day normal . I hit the office about ten , picked up some odds and ends of mail , slit the envelopes and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows wide to let out the smell of dust and dinginess that collected in the night and hung in the still air , in the corners of the room , in the slats of the venetian blinds . A dead moth was spread-eagled on a corner of the desk . On the win- dow sill a bee with tattered wings was crawling along the woodwork , buzzing in a tired remote sort of way , as if she knew it was n't any use , she was finished , she had flown too many missions and would never get back to the hive again . I knew it was going to be one of those crazy days . Everyone has them . Days when nobody rolls in but the loose wheels , the dingoes  | who park their brains with their gum , the squirrels who ca n't find their nuts , the mechanics who always have a gear wheel left over . The first was a big blond roughneck named Kuissenen or some- thing Finnish like that . He jammed his massive bottom in the customer 's chair and planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a power-shovel operator , that he lived in Culver City , and the goddam woman who lived next door to him was trying to poison his dog . Every morning before he let the dog out for a run in the back yard he had to search the place from fence to fence for meatballs thrown over the potato vine from next door . He 'd found nine of them so far and they were loaded with a greenish powder he knew was an arsenic weed killer . " How much to watch out and catch her at it ? " He stared at me as unblinkingly as a fish in a tank . " Why not do it yourself ? " " I got to work for a living , mister . I 'm losing four twentyfive an hour just corning up here to ask .

Spending a couple of weeks hiding " " Sorry , " I said . " I 'm tied up . Spending a couple of weeks hiding in a gopher hole in your back yard would be out of my line anyway  --  even for fifty bucks . " He stood up glowering . " Big shot , " he said . " Do n't need the dough , huh ? Ca n't be bothered saving the life of a itty-bitty dog . Nuts to you , big shot . " " I 've got troubles too , Mr. Kuissenen .

" Sure I 'm sure . " He was halfway to the door before the nickel dropped . He swung around fast then . " Say that again , buster . " I just shook my head . I did n't want to fight him . He might hit me on the head with my desk . He snorted and went out , almost taking the door with him .

Edelweiss . He had a card to feet , wearing a brown suit with sleeves too long , and a stiff white collar behind a purple tie with black diamonds on it . He sat on the edge of the chair without fidgeting and looked at me out of sad black eyes . His hair was black too and thick and rough without a sign of gray in it that I could see . He had a clipped mustache withp130a reddish tone . He could have passed for thirty-five if you did n't look at the backs of his hands . " Call me Simp , " he said . " Everybody else does . I got it coming . I 'm a Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , beautiful . She run away a couple of times before . " He got out a photo of her and showed it to me . She might have been beautiful to him .

He waved it away . " The client is always mister to me , " I added . " Until he has told me a few dozen lies anyway . " He smiled . " Lies I got no use for . It 's not a divorce matter . I justwant Mabel back again . But she do n't come back until I find her . Maybe it 's a kind of game with her . " He told me about her , patiently , without rancor . She drank , she played around , she was n't a very good wife by his standards , but he could have been brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house , he said , and he loved her . He did n't kid himself he was any dreamboat , just a steady worker bringing home the pay check . They had a joint bank account . She had drawn it all out , but he was prepared for that . He had a pretty good idea who she had lit out with , and if he was right the man would clean her out and leave her stranded . " Name of Kerrigan , " he said . " Monroe Kerrigan . I do n't aim to knock the Catholics . There is plenty of bad Jews too . This Kerrigan is a barber when he works . I ai n't knocking barbers either . But a lot of them are drifters and horse players . Not real steady . " " Wo n't you hear from her when she is cleaned out ? " " She gets awful ashamed . She might hurt herself . " " It 's a Missing Persons job , Mr. Edelweiss . You should go down and make a report . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want it that way . Mabel would be humiliated . " The world seemed to be full of people Mr. Edelweiss was not knocking . He put some money on the desk . " Two hundred dollars , " he said . " Down payment . I 'd rather do it my way . "  | " It will happen again , " I said . " Sure . " He shrugged and spread his hands gently . " But twenty- four years old and me almost fifty . flow could it be different ? She 'll settle down after a while . Trouble is , no kids . She ca n't have kids . A Jew likes to have a family . So Mabel knows that . She 's humiliated . " " You 're a very forgiving man , Mr. Edelweiss . " " Well I ai n't a Christian , " he said . " And I 'm not knocking Christians , you understand . But with me it 's real . I do n't just say it . I do it . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a picture postcard and pushed it across the desk after the money . " From Honolulu she sends it . Money goes fast in Hono-lulu . One of my uncles had a jewelry business there . Retired now . Lives in Seattle . " I picked the photo up again . " I 'll have to farm this one out , " I told him . " And I 'll have to have this copied . " " I could hear you saying that , Mr. Marlowe , before I got here . So I come prepared . " He took out an envelope and it contained five more prints . " I got Kerrigan too , but only a snapshot . " Ile went into another pocket and gave me another envelope . I looked at Kerrigan . He had a smooth dishonest face that did not surprise me . Three copies of Kerrigan . Mr. Simpson W. Edelweiss gave me another card which had on it his name , his residence , his telephone number . He said he hoped it would not cost too much but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds and he hoped to hear from me . " Two hundred ought to pretty near do it if she 's still in Hono- lulu , " I said . " What I need now is a detailed physical description of both parties that I can put into a telegram . Height , weight , age , coloring , any noticeable scars or other identifying marks , what clothes she was wearing and had with her , and how much money was in the account she cleaned out . If you 've been through this before , Mr. Edelweiss , you will know what I want . " " I got a peculiar feeling about this Kerrigan . Uneasy . " I spent another half hour milking him and writing things down . Then he stood up quietly , shook hands quietly , bowed and left the office quietly . " Tell Mabel everything is fine , " he said as he went out.  | It turned out to be routine . I sent a wire to an agency in Hono- lulu and followed it with an airmail containing the photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They found her working as a chambermaid 's helper in a luxury hotel , scrubbing bathtubs and bathroom floors and so on . Kerrigan had done just what Mr. Edelweiss expected , cleaned her out while she was asleep and skipped , leaving her stuck with the hotel bill . She pawned a ring which Kerrigan could n't have taken without violence , and got enough out of it to pay the hotel but not enough to buy her way home . So Edelweiss hopped a plane and went after her . He was too good for her . I sent him a bill for twenty dollars and the cost of a long telegram . The Honolulu agency grabbed the two hundred . With a portrait of Madison in my office safe I could afford to be underpriced . So passed a day in the life of a P.I . Not exactly a typical day but not totally untypical either . What makes a man stay with it nobody knows . You do n't get rich , you do n't often have much fun . Some- times you get beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once in a long while you get dead . Every other month you decide to give it up and find some sensible occupation while you can still walk without shaking your head . Then the door buzzer rings and you open the inner door to the waiting room and there stands a new face with a new problem , a new load of grief , and a small piece of money . " Come in , Mr. Thingummy . What can I do for you ? " There must be a reason . Three days later in the shank of the afternoon Eileen Wade called me up , and asked me to come around to the house for a drink the next evening . They were having a few friends in for cocktails . Roger would like to see me and thank me adequately . And would I please send in a bill ? " You do n't owe me anything , Mrs. Wade . What little I did I got paid for . " " 1 must have looked very silly acting Victorian about it , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will come , wo n't you ? " " I guess so . Against my better judgment . "  | " Roger is quite well again . He 's working . " " Good . " " You sound very solemn today . I guess you take life pretty seriously . " " Now and then . Why ? " She laughed very gently and said goodbye and hung up . I sat , there for a while taking life seriously . Then 1 tried to think of something funny so that I could have a great big laugh . Neither way worked , so I got Terry Lennox 's letter of farewell out of the safe and reread it . It reminded me that I had never gone to Victor 's for that gimlet he asked me to drink for him . It was just about the right time of day for the bar to be quiet , the way he would have liked it himself , if he had been around to go with me . I thought of him with a vague sadness and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I almost kept going . Almost , but not quite . I had too much of his money . He had made a fool of me but lie had paid well for the privilege . IT WAS SO QUIET IN VICTOR 'S that you almost heard the temperature drop as you came in at the door . On a bar stool a woman in a black tailormade , which could n't at that time of year have been anything but some synthetic fabric like orlon , was sitting alone with a pale greenish-colored drink in front of her and smoking a cigarette in a long jade holder . She had that fine-drawn intense look that is some- times neurotic , sometimes sex-hungry , and sometimes just the result of drastic dieting. , I sat down two stools away and the barkeep nodded to me , but did n't smile . " A gimlet , " I said . " No bitters. "  | He put the little napkin in front of me and kept looking at me . " You know something , " he said in a pleased voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I got me in a bottle of that Rose 's Lime Juice . Then you did n't come back any more and I only opened it tonight . " " My friend left town , " I said . " A double if it 's all right with you . And thanks for taking the trouble . " He went away . The woman in black gave me a quick glance , then looked down into her glass . " So few people drink them around here , " she said so quietly that I did n't realize at first that she wasspeaking to me . Then she looked my way again . She had very large dark eyes . She had the reddest fingernails I had ever seen . But she did n't look like a pickup and there was no trace of come-on in her voice . " Gimlets I mean . " " . A fellow taught me to like them , " I said . " He must be English . " " Why ? " " The lime juice . It 's as English as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the cook had bled into it . That 's how they got called limeys . The English  --  not the fish . " " I thought it was more a tropical drink , hot weather stuff . Malaya or some place like that . " " You may be right . " She turned away again . The bartender set the drink in front of me . With the lime juice it has a sort of pale greenish yellowish misty look . I tasted it . It was both sweet and sharp at the same time . The woman in black watched me . Then she lifted her own glass towards me . We both drank . Then I knew hers was the same drink . The next move was routine , so I did n't make it . I just sat there . " He was n't English , " I said after a moment . " I guess maybe he had been there during the war . We used to come in here once in a while , early like now . Before the mob started boiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " In a bar almost the only pleasant hour . " She emptied her glass . " Perhaps I knew your friend , " she said . " What was his name ? " I did n't answer her right away . I lit a cigarette and watched her tap the stub of hers out of the jade holder and fit another in its place . I reached across with a lighter . " Lennox , " I said. 135 She thanked me for the light and gave me a brief searching glance . Then she nodded . " Yes , 1 knew him very well . Perhaps a little too well . " The barkeep drifted over and glanced at my glass . " A couple more of the same , " I said . " In a booth . " I got down off the stool and stood waiting . She might or might not blow me down . I did n't particularly care . Once in a while in this much too sex-conscious country a man and a woman can meet and talk without dragging bedrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could just think I was on the make . If so , the hell with her . She hesitated , but not for long . She gathered up a pair of black gloves and a black suede bag with a gold frame and clasp and walked across into a corner booth and sat down without a word . I sat down across the small table . " My name is Marlowe . " " Mine is Linda Loring , : she said calmly . " A bit of a sentimen- talist , are n't you , Mr. Marlowe ? " " Because I came in here to drink a gimlet ? How about yourself ? " " I might have a taste for them . " " So might I. But it would be a little too much coincidence . " She smiled at me vaguely . She had emerald earrings and an emerald lapel pin . They looked like real stones because of the way they were cut  --  flat with beveled edges . And even in the ( lint light of a bar they had an inner glow. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're the man , " she said . The bar waiter brought the drinks over and set them down . When he went away I said : " I 'm a fellow who knew Terry Lennox , liked him , and had an occasional drink with him . It was kind of a side deal , an accidental friendship . I never went to his home or knew his wife . I saw her once in a parking lot . " " There was a little more to it than that , was n't there ? " She reached for her glass . She had an emerald ring set in a nest of diamonds . Beside it a thin platinum band said she was married . I diamonds . Beside it a thin platinum band said she was married . I put her in the second half of the thirties , early in the second half . " Maybe , " I said . " The guy bothered me . Ile still does . How . " Maybe , " I said . " The guy bothered me . Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an elbow and looked up at me without any par- ticular expression . " I said I knew him rather too well . Too well to think it mattered much what happened to him . He had a rich wife who gave him all the luxuries . All she asked in return was to be let alone . " " Seems reasonable , " I said . " Do n't be sarcastic , Mr. Marlowe . Some women are like that . They ca n't help it . It was n't as if he did n't know in the beginning . If he had to get proud , the door was open . He did n't have to kill her . " " I agree with you . " She straightened up and looked hard at me . Her lip curled . " So he ran away and , if what I hear is true , you helped him . I suppose you feel proud about that . " " Not me , " I said . " I just did it for the money . " " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why I sit here drinking with you . " " That 's easily changed , Mrs. Loring . " I reached for my glass and dropped the contents down the hatch . " I thought perhaps you could tell me something about Terry that I did n't know . I 'm not inter- ested in speculating why Terry Lennox beat his wife 's face to a bloody sponge . " " That 's a pretty brutal way to put it , ' " she said angrily . " You do n't like the words ? Neither do I. And I would n't be here drinking a gimlet if I believed he did anything of the sort . She stared . After a moment she said slowly : " He killed himself and left a full confession . What more do you want ? " " He had a gun , " I said . " In Mexico that might be enough excuse for some jittery cop to pour lead into him . Plenty of American police have done their killings the same way  --  some of them through doors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the confession , I have n't seen it . " " No doubt the Mexican police faked it , " she said tartly . " They would n't know how , not in a little place like Otatoclan . No , the confession is probably real enough , but it does n't prove he killed his wife . Not to me anyway . All it proves to me is that he did n't see any way out . In a spot like that a certain sort of man  --  you can call him weak or soft or sentimental if it amuses you  --  might decide to save some other people from a lot of very painful publicity . "  | " That 's fantastic , " she said . " A man does n't kill himself or de- liberately get himself killed to save a little scandal . Sylvia was already dead . As for her sister and her father  --  they could take care of themselves very efficiently . People with enough money , Mr. Marlowe , can always protect themselves . " " Okay , I 'm wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line . A minute ago you were mad at me . You want me to leave now  --  so you can drink your gimlet ? " Suddenly she smiled . " I 'm sorry . I 'm beginning to think you are sincere . What I thought then was that you were trying to justify yourself , far more than Terry . I do n't think you are , somehow . " " I 'm not . I did something foolish and I got the works for it . Up to a point anyway . I do n't deny that his confession saved me a lot worse . If they had brought him back and tried him , I guess they would have hung one on me too . The least it would have cost me would have been far more money than I could afford . " " Not to mention your license , " she said dryly . " Maybe . There was a time when any cop with a hangover could get me busted . It 's a little different now . You get a hearing before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not too crazy about the city police . " She tasted her drink and said slowly : " All things considered , do n't you think it was best the way it was ? No trial , no sensational headlines , no mud-slinging just to sell newspapers without the slightest regard for truth or fairplay or for the feelings of innocentpeople . " " Did n't I just say so ? And you said it was fantastic . " She leaned back and put her head against the upper curve of the padding on the back of the booth . " Fantastic that Terry Lennox should have killed himself just to achieve that . Not fantastic that it was better for all parties that there should be no trial . " " I need another drink , " I said , and waved at the waiter . " I feel an icy breath on the back of my neck . Could you by any chance be related to the Potter family , Mrs. Loring ? " " Sylvia Lennox was my sister , " she said simply . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I gave him an urgent message . Mrs. Loring shook her head and said she did n't want anything more.  |p138When  the waiter took off I said : " With the hush old man Potter  --  excuse me , Mr. Harlan Potter  --  put on this affair , I would be lucky to know for sure that Terry'swife even had a sister . " " Surely you exaggerate . My father is hardly that powerful , Mr. Marlowe  --  and certainly not that ruthless . I 'll admit he does have very old-fashioned ideas about his personal privacy . He never gives interviews even to his own newspapers . He is never photographed , he never makes speeches , he travels mostly by car or in his own plane with his own crew . But he is quite human for all that . He liked Terry . He said Terry was a gentleman twenty-four hours a day instead of for the fifteen minutes between the time the guests arrive and the time they feel their first cocktail . " " He slipped a little at the end . Terry did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried it for flavor and then sat there with a finger on the edge of the round base of the glass . " Terry 's death was quite a blow to him , Mr. Marlowe . And you 're getting sarcastic again . Please do n't . Father knew it would all lookdisappeared . If Terry had asked him for help , I think he would far too neat to some people . He would much rather Terry had just have given it . " " Oh no , Mrs. Loring . His own daughter had been murdered . " She made an irritable motion and eyed me coldly . " This is going to sound pretty blunt , I 'm afraid . Father had written my sister off long ago . When they met he barely spoke to her . If he expressed himself , which he has n't and wo n't , I feel surehe would be just as doubtful about Terry as you are . But once Terry was dead , what did it matter ? They could have been killed in a plane crash or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die , it was the best possible time for her to die . In another ten years she would have been a sex-ridden hag like some of these frightful women you see at Hollywood parties , or used to a few years back . The dregs of the international set . " All of a sudden I got mad , for no good reason . I stood up and looked over the booth . The next one was still empty . In the one beyond a guy was reading a paper all by himself , quietly . I sat down with a bump , pushed my glass out of the way , and leaned across thep139table . I had sense enough to keep my voice down . " For hell 's sake , Mrs. Loring , what are you trying to sell me ? That Harlan Potter is such a sweet lovely character he would n't dream of using his influence on a political D.A . to drop the blanket on a murder investigation so that the murder was never really investigated at all ? That he had doubts about Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out who was really the killer ? That he did n't use the political power of his newspapers and his bank account and the nine hundred guys who would trip over their chins trying to guess what he wanted done before he knew himself ? That he did n't arrange it so that a tame lawyer and nobody else , nobody from the D.A . ' s office or the city cops , went down to Mexico to make sure Terry actually had put a slug in his head instead of being knocked off by some Indian with a hot gun just for kicks ? Your old man is worth a hundred million bucks , Mrs. Loring . I would n't know just how he got it , but I know damn well he did n't get it without building himself a pretty far-reaching organization . He 's no softie . He 's a hard tough man . You 've got to be in these days to make that kind of money . And you do business with some funny people . You may not meet them or shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringe doing business with you . " " You 're a fool , " she said angrily . " I 've had enough of you . " " Oh sure . I do n't make the kind of music you like to hear . Let me tell you something . Terry talked to your old man the night Sylvia died . What about ? What did your old man say to him ? ' Just run on down to Mexico and shoot yourself , old boy . Let 's keep this in the family . I know my daughter is a tramp and that any one of a dozen drunken bastards might have blown his top and pushed her pretty face down her throat for her . But that 's inci- dental , old boy . The guy will be sorry when he sobers up . You 've had it soft and now is the time you pay back . What we want is to keep the fair Potter name as sweet as mountain lilac . She married you because she needed a front . She needs it worse than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you can get lost and stay lost , fine . But if you get found , you check out . See you in the morgue . ' " " Do you really think , " the woman in black asked with dry ice in her voice , " that my father talks like that ? " I leaned back and laughed unpleasantly . " We could polish up the dialogue a little if that helps . " She gathered her stuff together and slid along the seat . " I 'd like to give you a word of warning , " she said slowly and very carefully , " a very simple word of warning . If you think my father is that kind of man and if you go around broadcasting the kind of thoughts you have just expressed to me , your career in this city in your business or in any business is apt to be extremely short and terminated very suddenly . " " Perfect , Mrs. Loring . Perfect . I get it from the law , I get it from the hoodlum element , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , but the meaning is the same . Lay off . I came in here to drink a gimlet because a man asked me to . Now look at me . I 'm practically in the boneyard . " She stood up and nodded briefly . " Three gimlets . Doubles . Per- haps you 're drunk . " I dropped too much money on the table and stood up beside her . " You had one and a half , Mrs. Loring . Why even that much ? Did a man ask you too , or was it all your own idea ? Your own tongue got a little loose . " " Who knows , Mr. Marlowe ? Who knows ? Who really knows any- thing ? There 's a man over there at the bar watching us . Would it be anyone you know ? " I looked around , surprised that she had noticed . A lean dark character sat on the end stool nearest the door . " His name is Chick Agostino , " I said . " He 's a gun toter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and jump on him . " " You certainly are drunk , " she said quickly and started to walk . I went after her . The man on the stool swung around and looked to his front . When I came abreast I stepped up behind him and reached in under both his arms quickly . Maybe I was a little drunk . He swung around angrily and slid off the stool . " Watch it , kiddo , " he snarled . Out of the corner of my eye I saw that she had stopped just inside the door to glance back . " No guns , Mr. Agostino ? How reckless of you . It 's almost dark . What if you should run into a tough midget ? " " Scram ! " he said savagely . " Aw , you stole that line from the New Yorker. "  | His mouth worked but he did n't move . I left him and followed Mrs. Loring out through the door into the space under the awning . A gray-haired colored chauffeur stood there talking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went off and came back with a flossy Cadillac limousine . He opened the door and Mrs. Lor- ing got in . He shut the door as though he was putting clown the lid of a jewel box . He went around the car to the driver 's scat . She ran the window down and looked out at me , half smiling . " Goodnight , Mr. Marlowe . It 's been nice  --  or has it ? " " We had quite a fight . " " You mean you had  --  and mostly with yourself . " " It usually is . Goodnight , Mrs. Loring . You do n't live around here , do you ? " " Not exactly . I live in Idle Valley . At the far end of the lake . My husband is a doctor . " " Would you happen to know any people named Wade ? " She frowned . " Yes , I know the Wades . Why ? " " Why do I ask ? They 're the only people in Idle Valley that I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Marlowe . " She leaned back in the seat and the Cadillac purred politely and slid away into the traffic along the Strip . Turning I almost bumped into Chick Agostino . " Who 's the doll ? " he sneered . " And next time you crack wise , be missing . " " Nobody that would want to know you , " I said . " Okay , bright boy . I got the license number . Mendy likes to know little things like that . " The door of a car banged open and a man about seven feet high and four feet wide jumped out of it , took one look at Agostino , then one long stride , and grabbed him by the throat with one hand. one long stride , and grabbed him by the throat with one hand . " How many times I got ta tell you cheap hoods not to hang around where I eat ? " he roared . He shook Agostino and hurled him across the sidewalk against the wall . Chick crumpled up coughing . " Next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hell put the blast on you , and believe me , boy , you 'll be holding a gun when they pick you up . "  | Chick shook his head and said nothing . The big man gave me a raking glance and grinned . " Nice night , " he said , and strolled into Victor 's . I watched Chick straighten himself out and regain some of his composure . " Who 's your buddy ? " I asked him . " Big Willie Magoon , " he said thickly . " A vice squad bimbo . He thinks he 's tough . " " You mean he is n't sure ? " I asked him politely . He looked at me emptily and walked away . I got my car out of the lot and drove home . In Hollywood anything can happen , any- thing at all . A LOW-SWUNG JAGUAR swept around the hill in front of me and slowed down so as not to bathe me in the granite dust from the half mile of neglected paving at the entrance to Idle Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourage the Sunday drivers spoiled by drifting along on superhighways . I caught a glimpse of a bright scarf and a pair of situ goggles . A hand waved at me casu- ally , neighbor to neighbor . Then the dust slid across the road and added itself to the white film already well spread over the scrub and the sunbaked grass . Then I was around the outcrop and the paving started up in proper shape and everything was smooth and cared for . Live oaks clustered towards the road , as if they were curious to see who went by , and sparrows with rosy heads hopped about pecking at things only a sparrow would think worth pecking at . Then there were a few cottonwoods but no eucalyptus . Then a thick growth of Carolina poplars screening a white house . Then a girl walking a horse along the shoulder of the road . She had levis on and a loud shirt and she was chewing on a twig . The horse looked hot but not lathered and the girl was crooning to him gently.  |p143Beyond  a fieldstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge undulating lawn that ended far back in the portico of a Williamsburg Colonial mansion , the large de luxe size . Somewhere someone was playing left-handed exercises on a grand piano . Then all this wheeled away and the glisten of the lake showed hot and bright and I began to watch numbers on gateposts . I had seen the Wades ' house only once and in the dark . It was n't as big as it had looked by night . The driveway was full of cars , so I parkedon the side of the road and walked in . A Mexican butler in a white coat opened the door for me . He was a slender neat good-looking Mexican and his coat fitted him elegantly and he looked like a Mexican who was getting fifty a week and not killing himself with hard work . He said : " Buenas tardes , senor , " and grinned as if he had put one over . " Su nombre de Usted , por favor ? " " Marlowe , " I said , " and who are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone , remember ? " He grinned and I went in . It was the same old cocktail party , everybody talking too loud , nobody listening , everybody hanging on for dear life to a mug of the juice , eyes very bright , cheeks flushed or pale and sweaty according to the amount of alcohol con- sumed and the capacity of the individual to handle it . Then Eileen Wade materialized beside me in a pale blue something which did her no harm . She had a glass in her hand but it did n't look as if it was more than a prop . " I 'm so glad you could come , " she said gravely . " Roger wants to see you in his study . He hates cocktail parties . He 's working . " " With this racket going on ? " " It never seems to bother him . Candy will get you a drink  --  or if you 'd rather go to the bar  --  " She smiled . " I think you ... apologized already . It was nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smile long enough to nod and turn and walk away . " I 'll do that , " I said . " Sorry about the other night . " I spotted the bar over in the corner by some very large french win- dows . It was one of those things you push around . I was halfway across the room , trying not to bump anybody , when a voice said :  | " Oh , Mr. Marlowe . " 1 turned and saw Mrs. Loring on a couch beside a prissy-looking man in rimless cheaters with a smear on his chin that might have been a goatee . She had a drink in her hand and looked bored . He sat still with his arms folded and scowled . I went over there . She smiled at me and gave me her hand . " This is my husband , Dr. Loring . Mr. Philip Marlowe , Edward . " The guy with the goatee gave me a brief look and a still briefer nod . He did n't move otherwise . He seemed to be saving his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Linda Loring said . " Edward is always very tired . " " Doctors often are , " I said . " Can I get you a drink , Mrs. Loring ? Or you , Doctor ? " " She 's had enough , " the man said without looking at either of us . " I do n't drink . The more I see of people who do , the more glad I am that I do n't . " " Come back , little Sheba , " Mrs. Loring said dreamily . He swung around and did a take . I got away from there and made it to the bar . In the company of her husband Linda Loring seemed like a different person . There was an edge to her voice anda sneer in her expression which she had n't used on me even when she was angry . Candy was behind the bar . He asked me what I would drink . " Nothing right now , thanks . Mr. Wade wants to see me . " " Es muy occupado , senor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to like Candy . When I just looked at him he added : " But I go see .

" Okay , chum , let 's go , " he said cheerfully. opened a door , I went through , lie shut it behind me , and a lot ofthe noise was dimmed . It was a corner room , big and cool and I followed him across the room the long way of the house . He quiet , with french windows and roses outside and an airconditionerset in a window to one side . I could see the lake , and I could seeWade lying flat out on a long blond leather couch . A big bleached wood desk had a typewriter on it and there was a pile of yellow paper beside the typewriter.  | " Good of you to come , Marlowe , " he said lazily . " Park yourself . Did you have a drink or two ? " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He still looked a bit pale and pinched . " How 's the work going ? " " Fine , except that I get tired too quick . Pity a four-day drunk is so painful to get over . I often do my best work after one . In my racket it 's so easy to tighten up and get all stiff and wooden . Thenthe stuff is no good . When it 's good it comes easy . Anything you have read or heard to the contrary is a lot of mishmash . " " Depends who the writer is , maybe , " I said . " It did n't come easy to Flaubert , and his stuff is good . " " Okay , " Wade said , sitting up . " So you have read Flaubert , so that makes you an intellectual , a critic , a savant of the literary world . " He rubbed his forehead . " I 'm on the wagon and I hate it . I hate everybody with a drink in his hand . I 've got to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them knows I 'm an alcoholic . So they wonder what I 'm running away from .

' " " The way I got it , all this was rather recent , " I said . " It 's got worse , but I was always a hard man with a bottle . When you 're young and in hard condition you can absorb a lot of pun- ishment . When you are pushing forty you do n't snap back the same way . I leaned back and lit a cigarette . " What did you want to see me about ? " " What do you think I 'm running away from , Marlowe ? " " No idea . I do n't have enough information . Besides , everybody is running away from something . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Your youth or a guilty conscience or the knowledge that you 're a small time operator in a small time business ? " " I get it , " I said . " You need somebody to insult . Fire away , chum . When it begins to hurt I 'll let you know . " He grinned and rumpled his thick curly hair . He speared his chest with a forefinger . " You 're looking right at a small time oper- ator in a small time business , Marlowe . All writers are punks and I am one of the punkest . I 've written twelve best sellers , and if I ever finish that stack of magoozlum on the desk there I may pos- sibly have written thirteen . And not a damn one of them worth the residential neighborhood that belongs to a highly restricted multi- millionaire . I have a lovely wife who loves me and a lovely pub- powder to blow it to hell . I have a lovely home in a highly restricted lisher who loves me and I love me the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bitch , a literary prostitute or pimp  --  choose your own word  --  and an all-round heel . So what can you do for me ? " " Well , what ? " " Why do n't you get sore ? " " Nothing to get sore about . I 'm just listening to you hate your- self . It 's boring but it does n't hurt my feelings . " He laughed roughly . " I like you , " he said . " Let 's have a drink . " " Not in here , chum . Not you and me alone . I do n't care to watch you take the first one . Nobody can stop you and I do n't guess any- one would try . But I do n't have to help . " He stood up . " We do n't have to drink in here . Let 's go outside and glance at a choice selection of the sort of people you get to know when you make enough lousy money to live where they live . " " Look , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're no different from anybody else . " " Yeah , " he said tightly , " but they ought to be . If they 're not , what use are they ? They 're the class of the county and they 're no better than a bunch of truckdrivers full of cheap whiskey . Not as good . " " Knock it off , " I said again . " You want to get boiled , get boiled . But do n't take it out on a crowd that can get boiled without hav- ing to lie up with Dr. Verringer or get loose in the head and throw their wives down the stairs . " " Yeah , " he said , and he was suddenly calm and thoughtful . " You pass the test , chum . How about coming to live here for a while ? You could do me a lot of good just being here . " " I do n't see how . " " But I do . Just by being here . Would a thousand a month in- terest you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to be dan- gerous and I do n't want to be drunk . "  | " I could n't stop you . " " Try it for three months . I 'd finish the damn book and then go far off for a while . Lie up some place in the Swiss mountains and get clean . " " The book , huh ? Do you have to have the money ? " " No . I just have to finish something I started . If I do n't I 'm through . I 'm asking you as a friend . You did more than that for Lennox . " I stood up and walked over close to him and gave him a hard stare . " I got Lennox killed , mister . I got him killed . " " Phooey . Do n't go soft on me , Marlowe . " He put the edge of his hand against his throat . " I 'm up to here in the soft babies . " " Soft ? " I asked . " Or just kind ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch , but did n't lose his balance . " The hell with you , " he said smoothly . " No deal . I do n't blame you , of course . There 's something I want to know , that I have to know . You do n't know what it is and I 'm not sure I know myself . All I 'm positive of is that there is something , and I have to know it . " " About who ? Your wife ? " He moved his lips one over the other . " I think it 's about me , " he said . " Let 's go get that drink . " He walked to the door and threw it open and we went out . If he had been trying to make me uncomfortable , he had done a first class job . WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR the buzz from the living room exploded into our faces . It seemed louder than before , if possible . About twp148drinks louder . Wade said hello here and there and people seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been glad to see Pittsburgh Phil with his custom-built icepick . Life was just onegreat big vaudeville show . On the way to the bar we came face to face with Dr. Loring and his wife . The doctor stood up and stepped forward to face Wade . He had a look on his face that was almost sick with hatred . " Nice to see you , Doctor , " Wade said amiably . " Hi , Linda . Where have you been keeping yourself lately ? No , I guess that was a stupid question . I  --  " " Mr. Wade , " Loring said in a voice that had a tremor to it , " I have something to say to you . Something very simple , and I hope very conclusive . Stay away from my wife . " Wade looked at him curiously . " Doctor , you 're tired . And you do n't have a drink . Let me get you one . " " I do n't drink , Mr. Wade . As you very well know . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , I guess I get your point , " Wade said , still amiable . " And since you are a guest in my house , I have nothing to say except thatI think you are a little off the beam . " There had been a drop in the talk near by . The boys and girls were all ears . Big production . I ) r . Loring took a pair of gloves outof his pocket , straightened them , took hold of one by the finger end , and swung it hard against Wade 's face . Wade did n't bat an eye . " Pistols and coffee at dawn ? " he asked quietly . I looked at Linda Loring . She was flushed with anger . She stood up slowly and faced the doctor . " Dear God , what a ham you are , darling . Stop acting like a damn fool , will you , darling ? Or would you rather stick around until somebody slaps your face ? " Loring swung around to her and raised the gloves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , Doc . Around here we only hit our wives in private . " " If you are speaking for yourself , I am well aware of it , " Loring sneered . " And I do n't need lessons in manners from you . " " I only take promising pupils , " Wade said . " Sorry you have to leave so soon . " He raised his voice . " Candy ! Que el Doctor Loringp149salga de aqui en el acto ! " He swung back to Loring . " In case you do n't know Spanish , Doctor , that means the door is over there . " He pointed . Loring stared at him without moving . " I have warned you , Mr. Wade , " he said icily . " And a number of people have heard me . I shall not warn you again . " " Do n't , " Wade said curtly . " But if you do , make it on neutral territory . Gives me a little more freedom of action . Sorry , Linda . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy end of the glove had hit him . Linda Loring was smiling bitterly . She shrugged . " We are leaving , " Loring said . " Come , Linda . " She sat down again and reached for her glass . She gave her hus- band a glance of quiet contempt . " You are , " she said . " You have a number of calls to make , remember . " " You are leaving with me , " he said furiously . She turned her back on him . He reached suddenly and took hold of her arm . Wade took him by the shoulder and spun him around . " Take it easy , Doc . You ca n't win them all . " " Take your hand off me ! " " Sure , just relax , " Wade said . " I have a good idea , Doctor . Why do n't you see a good doctor ? " Somebody laughed loudly . Loring tensed like an animal all set to spring . Wade sensed it and neatly turned his back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he went after Wade , he would look sillier than he looked now . There was noth- ing for him to do but leave , and he did it . He marched quickly across the room staring straight in front of him to where Candy was holding the door open . He went out . Candy shut the door , wooden-faced , and went back to the bar . I went over there and asked for some Scotch . I did n't see where Wade went . He just dis- appeared . I did n't see Eileen either . I turned my back on the room and let them sizzle while I drank my Scotch . A small girl with mud-colored hair and a band around her fore- head popped up beside me and put a glass on the bar and bleated . Candy nodded and made her another drink . The small girl turned to me . " Are you interested in Commu-nism ? " she asked me . She was glassy-eyed -- and she was running  | small red tongue along her lips as if looking for a crumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , " she went on . " But when you ask any of the men here they just want to paw you . " I nodded and looked over my glass at her snub nose and sun- coarsened skin . " Not that I mind too much if it 's done nicely , " she told me , reaching for the fresh drink . She showed me her molars while she inhaled half of it . " Do n't rely on me , " I said . " What 's your name ? " " Marlowe . " " With an e ' or not ? " " With . " " Ah , Marlowe , " she intoned . " Such a sad beautiful name . " She put her glass down damn nearly empty and closed her eyes and threw her head back and her arms out , almost hitting me in the eye . Her voice throbbed with emotion , saying : " Was this the face that launch 'd a thousand ships And burnt the topless towers of Ilium ? Sweet Helen , make me immortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed her glass , and winked at me . " You were pretty good in there , ( hunt . Been writing any poetry lately ? " " Not very much . " " You can kiss me if you like , " she said coyly A guy in a shantung jacket and an open neck shirt came up be- hind her and grinned at me over the top of her head . He had short red hair and a face like a collapsed lung . He was as ugly a guy as I ever saw . He patted the top of the little girl 's head . " Come on kitten . Time to go home . " She rounded on him furiously . " You mean you got to water those goddamned tuberous begonias again ? " she yelled . " Aw listen , kitten  --  " " Take your hands off me , you goddamned rapist , " she screamed , and threw the rest of her drink his face . The rest was n't more than a teaspoonful and two lumps of ice . " For Chrissake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled back , grab- bing for a handkerchief and mopping his face . " Get it ? Your hus- band . "  | She sobbed violently and threw herself into his arms . I stepped around them and got out of there . Every cocktail party is the same , even the dialogue . The house was leaking guests out into the evening air now . Voices were fading , cars were starting , goodbyes were bouncing around like rubber balls . I went to the french windows and out onto a flagged terrace . The ground sloped towards the lake which was as motionless as a sleeping cat . There was a short wooden pier down there with a rowboat tied to it by a white painter . Towards the far shore , which was n't very far , a black waterhen was doing lazy curves , like a skater . They did n't seem to cause as much as a shallow ripple . I stretched out on a padded aluminum chaise and lit a pipe and smoked peacefully and wondered what the hell I was doing there . Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really wanted to . He had done all right with Loring . I would n't have been too surprised if he had hung one on Loring 's sharp little chin . He would have been out of line by the rules , but Loring was much farther out of line . If the rules mean anything at all any more , they mean that you do n't pick a roomful of people as the spot to threaten a man and hit him across the face with a glove when your wife is standing right beside you and you are practically accusing her of a little double time . For a man still shaky from a hard bout with the hard stuff Wade had done all right . He had done more than all right . Of course I had n't seen him drunk . I did n't know what he would be like drunk . I did n't even know that he was an alcoholic . There 's a big difference . A man who drinks too much on occasion is still the same man as he was sober . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same man at all . You ca n't predict anything about him for sure except that he will be someone you never met before . Light steps sounded behind me and Eileen Wade came across the terrace and sat down beside me on the edge of a chaise . " Well , what did you think ? " she asked quietly . " About the gentleman with the loose gloves ? " " Oh no . " She frowned . Then she laughed . " I hate people who make stagy scenes like that . Not that he is n't a fine doctor . He has played that scene with half the men in the valley . Linda Loring is no tramp . She does n't look like one , talk like one , or behave like one . I do n't know what makes Dr. Loring behave as if she was . " " Maybe he 's a reformed drunk , " I said . " A lot of them grow pretty puritanical . " " It 's possible , " she said , and looked towards the lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think a writer would be happy here  --  if a writer is ever happy anywhere . " She turned to look at me . " So you wo n't be persuaded to do what Roger asked . " " There 's no point in it , Mrs. Wade . Nothing I could do . I 've said all this before . I could n't be sure of being around at the right time . I 'd have to be around all the time . That 's impossible , even if I had nothing else to do . If he went wild , for example , it would happen in a flash . And I have n't seen any indications that he does get wild . He seems pretty solid to me . " She looked down at her hands . " If he could finish his book , I think things would be much better . " " I ca n't help him do that . " She looked up and put her hands on the edge of the chaise beside her . She leaned forward a little . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole point . Is it that you would find it distasteful to be a guest in our house and be paid for it ? " " He needs a psychiatrist , Mrs. Wade . If you know one that is n't a quack . " She looked startled . " A psychiatrist ? Why ? " I knocked the ashes out of my pipe and sat holding it , waiting for the bowl to get cooler before I put it away . " You want an amateur opinion , here it is . He thinks he has a secret buried in his mind and he ca n't get at it . It may be a guilty secret about himself , it may be about someone else . He thinks that 's what makes him drink , because he ca n't get at this thing . He probably thinks that whatever happened , happened while he was drunk and he ought to find it wherever people go when they 're drunk  --  really bad drunk , the way he gets . That 's a job for a psychiatrist . So far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets drunk because he wants to or ca n't help it , and the idea about the secret is just his excuse . He ca n't write his book , or anyway ca n't finish it . Because he gets drunk . That is , the assumption seems to be thatmorning or very late at night , I think I may see him waiting for  |p153he  ca n't finish his book because he knocks himself out by drinking . It could be the other way around . " " Oh no , " she said . " No . Roger has a great deal of talent . I feel quite sure that his best work is still to come . " " I told you it was an amateur opinion . You said the other morn- ing that he might have fallen out of love with his wile . That 's something else that could go the other way around . " She looked towards the house , then turned so that she had her back to it . I looked the same way . Wade was standing inside the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved behind the bar and reached for a bottle . " There 's no use interfering , " she said quickly . " I never do . Never . I suppose you 're right , Mr. Marlowe . There just is n't anything to do but let him work it out of his system . " The pipe was cool now and I put it away . " Since we 're groping around in the back of the drawer , how about that other way around ? " " I love my husband , " she said simply . " Not as a young girl loves , man I loved then is dead . He died in the war . His name , strangely enough , had the same initials as yours . It does n't matter now  --  except that sometimes I ca n't quite believe that he is ( lead . His perhaps . But I love him . A woman only a young girl once . The body was never found . But that happened to many men . " She gave me a long searching look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowy corner . " She paused and dropped her eyes . " It 's very silly . I 'm ashamed of it. - We were very much in love  --  the wild , mysterious , improbable kind of love that never comes but once . " She stopped talking and sat there half in a trance looking out over the lake . I looked back at the house again . Wade was stand- good hotel at a dead hour , or along the deck of a liner , early in theing just inside the open french windows with a glass in his hand . I looked back at Eileen . For her I was n't there any more . I got up and went into the house . Wade stood there with the drink and course  --  when I go into a quiet cocktail lounge or the lobby of a the drink looked pretty heavy . And his eyes looked wrong . " How you making out with my wife , Marlowe ? " It was said withp154a twist of the mouth . " No passes , if you mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean it . You got to kiss her the other night . Probably fancy yourself as a fast worker , but you 're wastingyour time , bud . Even if you had the right kind of polish . " I tried to move around him but he blocked me with a solid shoulder . " Do n't hurry away , old man . We like you around . We get so few private dicks in our house . " " I 'm the one too many , " I said . He hoisted the glass and drank from it . When he lowered it he leered at me . " You ought to give yourself a little more time to build resist- ance , " I told him . " Empty words , huh ? " " Okay , coach . Some little character builder , are n't you ? You ought to have more sense than to try educating a drunk . Drunks do n't educate , my friend . They disintegrate . And part of the process is a lot of fun . " He drank from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is damned awful . But if I may quote the scintillating words of the good Dr. Loring , a bastardly bastard with a little black bag , stay away from my wife , Marlowe . Sure you go for her . They all do . You 'd like to sleep with her . They all would . You 'd like to share her dreams and sniff the rose of her memories . Maybe I would too . But there is nothing to share , chum  --  nothing , nothing , nothing . You 're all alone in the dark . " He finished his drink and turned the glass upside down . " Empty like that , Marlowe . Nothing there at all . I 'm the guy that knows . " He put the glass on the edge of the bar and walked stiffly to the foot of the stairs . He made about a dozen steps up , holding on to the rail , and stopped and leaned against it . He looked down at me with a sour grin . " Forgive the corny sarcasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want anything to happen to you . " " Anything like what ? " " Perhaps she did n't get around yet to that haunting magic of her first love , the guy that went missing in Norway . You would n't want to be missing , would you , chum ? You 're my own special pri/vate eye . You find me when I 'm lost in the savage splendor of Sepulveda Canyon . " He moved the palm of his hand in a circular motion on the polished wood banister . " It would hurt me to the quick if you got lost yourself . Like that character who hitched up with the limeys . He got so lost a man sometimes wonders if he ever existed . You figure she could have maybe just invented him to have a toy to play with ? " " How would I know ? " He looked down at me . There were deep lines between his eyes now and his mouth was twisted with bitterness . " How would anybody know ? Maybe she do n't know herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken toys . Baby wants to go bye-bye . " He went on up the stairs . I stood there until Candy came in and started tidying up around the bar , putting glasses on a tray , examining bottles to see what wasleft , paying no attention to me . Or so I thought . Then he said : " Senor . One good drink left . Pity to waste him . " He held up a bottle . " You drink it . " " Gracias , senor , no me gusta . Un vaso de cerveza , no mas . A glass of beer is my limit . " " Wise man . " " One lush in the house is enough , " he said , staring at me . " I speak good English , not ? " " Sure , fine . " " But I think Spanish . Sometimes I think with a knife . The boss is my guy . He do n't need any help , hombre . I take care of him , see . " " A great job you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flauta , " he said between his white teeth . He picked up a loaded tray and swung it up on the edge of his shoulder and the flat of his hand , bus boy style . I walked to the door and let myself out , wondering how an ex- pression meaning son of a flute ' had come to be an insult in Span- ish . I did n't wonder very long . I had too many other things to wonder about . Something more than alcohol was the matter with the Wade family . Alcohol was no more than a disguised reaction.  | Later that night , between nine-thirty and ten , I called the Wades ' number . After eight rings I hung up , but I had only just taken my hand off the instrument when it started to ring me . It was Eileen Wade . " Someone just rang here , " she said . " I had a sort of hunch it might be you . I was just getting ready to take a shower . " " It was me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little woolly-headed when I left  --  Roger did . I guess maybe I feel a little responsibility for him by now . " " He 's quite all right , " she said . " Fast asleep in bed . I think Dr. Loring upset him more than he showed . No doubt he talked a lot of nonsense to you . " " He said he was tired and wanted to go to bed . Pretty sensible , I thought . " " If that is all he said , yes . Well , goodnight and thank you for calling , Mr. Marlowe . " " I did n't say it was all he said . I said he said it . " There was a pause , then : " Everyone gets fantastic ideas once in a while . Do n't take Roger too seriously , Mr. Marlowe . After all , his imagination is rather highly developed . Naturally it would be . He should n't have had anything to drink so soon after the last time . Please try to forget all about it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He was n't rude to me . He made quite a lot of sense . Your hus- band is a guy who can take a long hard look at himself and see what is there . It 's not a very common gift . Most people go through life using up half their energy trying to protect a dignity they never had . Goodnight , Mrs. Wade . " She hung up and I set out the chess board . I filled a pipe , paraded the chessmen and inspected them for French shaves and loose buttons , and played a championship tournament game be- tween Gortchakoff and Meninkin , seventy-two moves to a draw , a prize specimen of the irresistible force meeting the immovable ob ject , a battle without armor , a war without blood , and as elaborate a waste of human intelligence as you could find anywhere outside an advertising agency.  | NOTHING HAPPENED FOR A WEEK except that I went about my busi- ness which just then did n't happen to be very much business . One morning George Peters of The Carne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be down Sepulveda Canyon way and had looked in on Dr. Verringer 's place just out of curiosity . But Dr. Verringer was no longer there . Half a dozen teams of sur- veyors were mapping the tract for a subdivision . Those he spoke to had never even heard of Dr. Verringer . " The poor sucker got closed out on a trust deed , " Peters said . " I checked . They gave him a grand for a quitclaim just to save time and expense , and now somebody is going to make a million bucks clear , out of cutting the place up for residential property . That 's the difference between crime and business . For business you got ta have capital . Sometimes I think it 's the only difference . " " A properly cynical remark , " I said , " but big time crime takes capital too . " " And where does it come from , chum ? Not from guys that hold up liquor stores . So long . See you soon . " It was ten minutes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His voice was thick , almost gurgling , but l recog- nized it somehow . And I could hear short hard rapid breathing over the telephone . " I 'm in bad shape , Marlowe . Very bad . I 'm slipping my anchor . Could you make it out here in a hurry ? " Sure  --  but let me talk to Mrs. Wade a minute . " He did n't answer . There was a crashing sound , then a dead silence , then in a short while a kind of banging around . I yelled something into the phone without getting any answer . Time passed . Finally the light click of the receiver being replaced and the buzz of an open line . In five minutes I was on the way . I made it in slightly over half an hour and I still do n't know how . I went over the pass on wings and hit Ventura Boulevard with the light against me and made ap158left turn anyhow and dodged between trucks and generally made a damn fool of myself . I went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer edge of the parked cars so that it would freeze anyone with a notion to step out suddenly . I had the kind of luck you only get when you do n't care . No cops , no sirens , no red flashers . Just visions of what might be happening in the Wade residence and not very pleasant visions . She was alone in the house with a drunken maniac , she was lying at the bottom of the stairs with her neck broken , she was behind a locked door and somebody was howling outside and trying to break it in , she was running down a moonlit road barefoot and a big buck Negro with a meat cleaver was chasing her . It was n't like that at all . When I swung the Olds into their drivewaylights were on all over the house and she was standing in the open doorway with a cigarette in her mouth . I got out and walked over the flagstones to her . She had slacks on and a shirt with an open collar . She looked at me calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it with me . The first thing I said was as loony as the rest of my behavior . " I thought you did n't smoke . " " What ? No , I do n't usually . " She took the cigarette out and looked at it and dropped it and stepped on it . " Once in a long while . He called Dr. Verringer . " It was a remote placid voice , a voice heard at night over water . Completely relaxed . " He could n't , " I said . " Dr. Verringer does n't live there any more . He called me . " " Oh really ? I just heard him telephoning and asking someone to come in a hurry . I thought it must be Dr. Verringer . " " Where is he now ? " " He fell down , " she said . " He must have tipped the chair too far back . He 's done it before . He cut his head on something . There 's a little blood , not much . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We would n't want a whole lot of blood . Where is he now , I asked you . " She looked at me solemnly . Then she pointed . " Out there some- where . By the edge of the road or in the bushes along the fence . " I leaned forward and peered at her . " Chrissake , did n't you look ? "  | I decided by this time , that she was in shock . Then I looked back near the fence. across the lawn . I did n't see anything but there was heavy shadow " No , I did n't look , " she said quite calmly . " You find him . I 've had all of it I can take . I 've had more than I can take . You find him . " She turned and walked back into the house , leaving the door open . She did n't walk very far . About a yard inside the door she just crumpled to the floor and lay there . I scooped her up and spread her out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a long blond cocktail table . I felt her pulse . It didn'tseem very weak or unsteady . Her eyes were closed and the lids were blue . I left her there and went back out . He was there all right , just as she had said . He was lying on his side in the shadow of the hibiscus . He had a fast thumping pulse and his breathing was unnatural . Something on the back of his head was sticky . I spoke to him and shook him a little . I shipped dragged him up into a sitting position and dragged one of his arms his face a couple of times . He mumbled but did n't come to . I over my shoulder and heaved him up with my back turned to him and grabbed for a leg . I lost . He was as heavy as a block of cement . We both sat down on the grass and I took a short breather and tried again . Finally I got him hoisted into a fireman 's lift positionand plowed across the lawn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same distance as a round trip to Siam . The two steps of the porch were ten feet high . I staggered over to the couch and went down on my knees and rolled him off . When I straightened up again my spine felt as if it had cracked in at least three places . Eileen Wade was n't there any more . I had the room to myself . I was too bushed at the moment to care where anybody was . I sat down and looked at him and waited for sonic breath . Then I looked at his head . It was smeared with blood . His hair was sticky with it . It did n't look very bad but you never know with a head wound . Then Eileen Wade was standing beside me , quietly looking down at him with that same remote expression . " I 'm sorry I fainted , " she said . " I do n't know why . "  | " I guess we 'd better call a doctor . " " I telephoned Dr. Loring . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to come . " " Try somebody else then . " " Oh he 's coming , " she said . " He did n't want to . But he 's com- ing as soon as he can manage . " " Where 's Candy ? " " This is his day off . Thursday . The cook and Candy have Thurs- days off . It 's the usual thing around here . Can you get him up tobed ? " " Not without help . Better get a rug or blanket . It 's a warm night , but cases like this get pneumonia very easily . " She said she would get a rug . I thought it was damn nice of her . But I was n't thinking very intelligently . I was too bushed from carrying him . We spread a steamer rug over him and in fifteen minutes Dr. Loring came , complete with starched collar and rimless cheaters and the expression of a man who has been asked to clean up after the dog got sick . He examined Wade 's head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No chance of concussion . I should say his breath would in-dicate his condition rather obviously . " He reached for his hat . He picked up his bag . " Keep him warm , " he said . " You might bathe his head gently and get rid of the blood . He 'll sleep it off . " " I ca n't get him upstairs alone , Doctor , " I said . " Goodnight , Mrs. Wade . As you know I do n't treat alcoholics . Evenif I did , your husband would not be one of my patients . I 'm sure " Then leave him where he is . " He looked at me without interest . you understand that . " " Nobody 's asking you to treat him , " T said . " I 'm asking for somehelp to get him into his bedroom so that I can undress him . " " And just who are you ? " Dr. Loring asked me freezingly . " My name 's Marlowe . I was here a week ago . Your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " In what connection do you know my wife ? " " What the hell does that matter ? All I want is  --  "  | " I 'm not interested in what you want , " he cut in on me . He turned to Eileen , nodded briefly , and started out . I got between him and the door and put my back to it . " Just a minute , Doc . Must be a long time since you glanced at that little piece of prose called the Hippocratic Oath . This man called me on the phone and I live some way off . He sounded bad and I broke every traffic law in the state getting over here . I foundhim lying out on the ground and I carried him in here and be- lieve me he is n't any bunch of feathers . The houseboy is away and there 's nobody here to help me upstairs with Wade . How does it look to you ? " " Get out of my way , " he said between his teeth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them send over a deputy . As a pro- fessional man  --  " " As a professional man you 're a handful of flea dirt , " I said , and moved out of his way . He turned red  --  slowly but distinctly . He choked on his own bile . Then he opened the door and went out . He shut it carefully . As he pulled it shut he looked in at me . It was as nasty a look as I ever got and on as nasty a face as I ever saw . When I turned away from the door Eileen was smiling . " What 's funny ? " I snarled. know who Dr. Lorin is ? " " Yeah and I know what he is . " She glanced at her wrist watch . " Candy ought to be home by now , " she said . " I 'll go see . He has a room behind the garage . " She went out through an archway and I sat down and looked at Wade . The great big writer man went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug over him . In a minute or two Eileen came back and she had Candy with her . " You . You do n't care what you say to people , do you ? Do n't you  |p162THE  MEX HAD a black and white checked sport shirt , heavily pleated black slacks without a belt , two-tone black and white buckskin shoes , spotlessly clean . His thick black hair was brushed straight back and shining with some kind of hair oil or cream . " Senor , " he said , and sketched a brief sarcastic bow . " Help Mr. Marlowe carry my husband upstairs , Candy . He fell and hurt himself a little . I 'm sorry to trouble you . " " De nada , senora , " Candy said smiling . " I think I 'll say goodnight , " she said to me . " I 'm tired out . Candy will get you anything you want . " She went slowly up the stairs . Candy and I watched her . " Some doll , " he said confidentially . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Es lastima . She is very lonely , that one . " " Get that gleam out of your eye , kid . Let 's put this to bed . " He looked sadly at Wade snoring on the couch . " Pobrecito , " he murmured as if he meant it . " Borracho como una cuba . " " He may be drunk as a sow but he sure ai n't little , " I said . " You take the feet . " We carried him and even for two he was as heavy as a lead coffin . At the top of the stairs we went along an open balcony past a closed door . Candy pointed to it with his chin . " La senora , " he whispered . " You knock very light maybe she let you in . " I did n't say anything because I needed him . We went on with the carcass and turned in at another door and dumped him on the bed . Then I took hold of Candy 's arm high up near the shoulder where dug-in fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winced a little and then his face set hard . " What 's your name , cholo ? " " Take your hand off me , " he snapped . " And do n't call me a cholo . I 'm no wetback . My name is Juan Garcia de Soto y Soto- mayor . I am Chileno. "  | " Okay , Don Juan . Just do n't get out of line around here . Keep your nose and mouth clean when you talk about the people you work for . " He jerked loose and stepped back , his black eyes hot with anger . His hand slipped inside his shirt and came out with a long thin knife . He balanced it by the point on the heel of his hand , hardly even glancing at it . Then he dropped the hand and caught the handle of the knife while it hung in the air . It was done very fast and without any apparent effort . His hand went up to shoulder height , then snapped forward and the knife sailed through the air and hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuidado , senor ! " he said with a sharp sneer . " And keep your paws to yourself . Nobody fools with me . " He walked lithely across the room and plucked the knife out of the wood , tossed it in the air , spun on his toes and caught it behind him . With a snap it disappeared under his shirt . " Neat , " I said , " but just a little on the gaudy side . " He strolled up to me smiling derisively . " And it might get you a broken elbow , " I said . " Like this . " I took hold of his right wrist , jerked him off balance , swung to one side and a little behind him , and brought my bent forearm up under the back of his elbow joint . I bore down on it , using my forearm as a fulcrum . " One hard jerk , " I said , " and your elbow joint cracks . A crack is enough . You 'd be out of commission as a knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little harder and you 'd be through permanently . Take Mr. Wade 's shoes off . " I let go of him and he grinned at me . " Good trick , " he said . " I will remember . " He turned to Wade and reached for one of his shoes , then stopped . There was a smear of blood on the pillow . " Who cut the boss ? " " Not me , chum . He fell and cut his head on something . It 's only a shallow cut . The doctor has been here . " Candy let his breath out slowly . " You see him fall ? " " Before I got here . You like this guy , do n't you ? " He did n't answer me . He took the shoes off . We got Wade un- dressed little by little and Candy dug out a pair of green and silverp164pajamas . We got Wade into those and got him inside the bed and well covered up . He was still sweaty and still snoring . Candy looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to side , slowly . " Somebody 's got to take care of him , " he said . " I go change my clothes . " " Get some sleep . I 'll take care of him . I can call you if I need you . " He faced me . " You better take care of him good , " he said in a quiet voice . " Very good . " He went out of the room . I went into the bathroom and got a wet washcloth and a heavy towel . I turned Wade over a little and spread the towel on the pillow and washed the blood off his head gently so as not to start the bleeding again . Then I could see a sharp shallow cut about two inches long . It was nothing . Dr. Lor- ing had been right that much . It would n't have hurt to stitch it butit probably was not really necessary . I found a pair of scissors andcut the hair away enough so that I could put on a strip of ad- hesive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . I guess that was a mistake . He opened his eyes . They were vague and unfocused at first , then they cleared and he saw rue standing beside the bed . His hand moved and went up to his head and felt the adhesive . His lips mumbled something , then his voice cleared up also . " Who hit me ? You ? " His hand felt for the adhesive . " Nobody hit you . You took a fall . " " Took a fall ? When ? Where ? " " Wherever you telephoned from . You called me . I heard you fall . Over the wire . " " I called you ? " He grinned slowly . " Always available , are n't you , fella ? What time is it ? " " After one A.M. " " Where 's Eileen ? " " Gone to bed . She had it rough . " Ile thought that over silently . His eyes were full of pain . " Did I  --  " He stopped and winced . " You did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what you mean.  |p165You  just wandered outdoors and passed out near the fence . Quit talking . Go to sleep . " " Sleep , " he said quietly and slowly , like a child reciting its lesson . " What would that be ? " " Maybe a pill would help . Got any ? " " In the drawer . Night table . " I opened it and found a plastic bottle with red capsules in it . Seconal , 11/2 grains . Prescription by Dr. Loring . That nice Dr. Loring . Mrs. Roger Wade 's prescription . I shook two of them loose and put the bottle back and poured a glass of water from a thermos jug on the night table . He said one capsule would be enough . He took it and drank some water and lay back and stared at the ceiling again . Time passed . I sat in a chair and watched him . He did n't seem to get sleepy . Then he said slowly : " I remember something . Do me a favor , Marlowe . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . It 's on top of the typewriterunder the cover . Tear it up for me . " " Sure . That all you remember ? " " Eileen is all right ? Positive about that ? " " Yes . She 's just tired . Let it ride , Wade . Stop thinking . I should n't have asked you . " " Stop thinking , the man says . " His voice was a little drowsy now . He was talking as if to himself . " Stop thinking , stop dreaming , stop loving , stop hating . Goodnight , sweet prince . I 'll take that other pill . " I gave it to him with some more water . He lay back again , this time with his head turned so that he could see me . " Look , Marlowe , I wrote some stuff I do n't want Eileen  --  " " You told me already . I 'll attend to it when you go to sleep . " " Oh . Thanks . Nice to have you around . Very nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Some people . like it . " His eyes went shut all the way . Then they opened again , but they " Nasty feeling , is n't it ? " Ever kill a man , Marlowe ? "  |p166looked  vague . " How could they ? " I did n't answer . The eyelids came down again , very gradually , like a slow curtain in the theater . He began to snore . I waited a little longer . Then I dimmed the light in the room and went out . I STOPPED OUTSIDE Eileen 's door and listened . I did n't hear any sound of movement inside , so I did n't knock . If she wanted to know how he was , it was up to her . Downstairs the living room looked bright and empty . I put out some of the lights . From over near the front door I looked up at the balcony . The middle part of the living room rose to the full height of the house walls and was crossed by open beams that also supported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides by a solid railing which looked to be about three and a half feet high . The top and the uprights were cut square to match the cross beams . The dining room was through a square arch closed off by double louvered doors . Above it I guessed there were servants ' quarters . This part of the second floor was walled off so there would be another stair- way reaching it from the kitchen part of the house . Wade 's room was in the corner over his study . 1 could see the light from his opendoor reflected against the high ceiling and I could see the top foot of his doorway . I cut all the lights except in one standing lamp and crossed to the study . The door was shut but two lamps were lit , a standing lamp at the end of the leather couch and a cowled desk lamp . The type- writer was on a heavy stand under this and beside it on the desk there was a disorderly mess of yellow paper . I sat in a padded chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he had cut his head . I sat in his desk chair with the phone at my left hand . The gadget ridden man of our age loves it , loathes it , and is afraid of it . But he always treats it with respect , even when he is drunk ..  | The spring was set very weak . If I tilted back and went over , my head might have caught the corner of the desk . I moistened my handkerchief and rubbed the wood . No blood , nothing there There was a lot of stuff on the desk , including a row of books between bronze elephants , and an old-fashioned square glass inkwell . I tried that without result . Not much point to it anyway , because if someone else had slugged him , the weapon did n't have to be in the room . And there was n't anyone else to do it . I stood up and switched on the cornice lights . They reached into the shadowy corners and of course the answer was simple enough after all . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , with paper spilled . It could n't have walked there , so it had been thrown or kicked . I tried its sharp corners with my moistened hand- - kerchief . I got the red-brown smear of blood this time . No mystery at all . Wade had fallen over and struck his head on the sharp corner of the wastebasket  --  a glancing blow most likely  --  picked himself up and booted the damn thing across the room . Easy . Then he would have another quick drink . The drinking liquor was on the cocktail table in front of the couch . An empty bottle , another three quarters full , a thermos jug of water and a silver bowl containing water which had been ice cubes . There was only one glass and it was the large economy size . Having taken his drink he felt a little better . He noticed the phone off the hook in a bleary sort of way and very likely did n't remember any more what he had been doing with it . So he just walked across and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been just about right . There is something:compulsive about a telephone , The telephone is a fetish . Any normal man would have said hello into the mouthpiece before hanging up , just to be sure . But not necessarily a man who was bleary with drink and had just taken a fall . It did n't matter anyhow . His wife might have done it , she might have heard the fall and the bang as the wastebasket bounced against the wall and come into the study . About that time the last drink would kick him in the face and he would stagger out of the house and across the frontp168lawn and pass out where I had found him . Somebody was coming for him . By this time he did n't know who it was . Maybe the good Dr. Verringer . So far , so good . So what would his wife do ? She could n't handle him or reason with him and she might well be afraid to try . So she would call somebody to come and help . The servants were out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , she had called somebody . She had called that nice Dr. Loring . I 'd just assumed she called him after I got there . She had n't said so . From here on it did n't quite add up . You 'd expect her to look for him and find him and make sure he was n't hurt . It would n't hurt him to lie out on the ground on a warm summer night for a while . She could n't move him . It had taken all I had to do that . But you would n't quite expect to find her standing in the open doorway smoking a cigarette , not knowing except very vaguely where he was . Or would you ? I did n't know what she had been through with him , how dangerous he was in that condition , how much afraid she might be to go near him . " I 've had all of it I can take , " she had said to mewhen I arrived . " You find him . " Then she had gone inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I had to leave it at that . I had to assume that when she had been up against the situation often enough to know there was nothing she could do about it except to let it ride , then that would be what she would do . Just that . Let it ride . Let him lie out there on the ground until somebody came around with the physical equipment to handle . him . It still bothered me . It bothered me also that she had checked out and gone into her own room while Candy and I got him upstairs to bed . She said she loved the guy . Ile was her husband , they had been married for five years , he was a very nice guy indeed when sober  --  those were her own words . Drunk , he was something else , something to stay away from because he was dangerous . All right , forget it . But somehow it still bothered me . If she was really scared , she would n't have been standing there in the opm door smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disgusted , she would n't have fainted . There was something else . Another woman , perhaps . Then she had only just found out . Linda Loring ? Maybe . Dr. Loringp169thought so and said so in a very public manner . I stopped thinking about it and took the cover off the typewriter . The stuff was there , several loose sheets of typed yellow paper thatI was supposed to destroy so Eileen would n't see them . I took them over to the couch and decided I deserved a drink to go with the reading matter . There was a half bath off the study . I rinsed the tall glass out and poured a libation and sat down with it to read . And what I read was really wild . Like this : The moon 's four days off the full and there 's a square patch of moonlight on the wall and it 's looking at me like a big blind milky eye , a wall eye . Joke . Goddam silly simile . Writers . Everything has to be like something else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sweet . More similes . I could vomit just thinking about the lousy racket . I could vomit anyway . I probably will . Do n't push me . Give me time . The worms in my solar plexus crawl and crawl and crawl . I would be better off in bed but there would be a dark animal underneath the bed and the dark animal would crawl around rustling and hump himself and bump the underside of the bed , then I would let out a yell that would n't make any sound except to me . A dream yell , a yell in a nightmare . There is nothing to be afraid of and I am not afraid because there is nothing to be afraid of , but just the same I was lying like that once in bed and the dark animal was doing it to me , bumping himself against the underside of the bed , and I had an orgasm . That disgusted me more than any other of the nasty things I have done . I 'm dirty . I need a shave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I smell foul to myself . The shirt under my arms is wet and on the chest and back . The sleeves are wet in the folds of the elbows . The glass on the table is empty . It would take both hands to pour the stuff now . I could get one out of the bottle maybe to brace me . The taste of the stuff is sickening . And it would n't get me anywhere . In the end I wo n't be able to sleep even and the whole world will moan in the horror of tortured nerves . Good stuff , huh , Wade ? More . It 's all right for the first two or three days and then it is negative . You suffer and you take a drink and for a little while it is better , but the price keeps getting higher and higher and what you get for it is less and less and then there is always the point where you get nothing but nausea . Then you call Ver- ringer . All right , Verringer , here I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's gone to Cuba or he is dead . The queen has killed him . Poor old Verringer , what a fate , to die in bed with a queen  --  that kind of queen . Come on , Wade , let 's get up and go places . Places where we have n't ever been and are n't ever going back to when we have been . Does this sentence make sense ? No . Okay , I 'm not asking any money for it . A short pause here for a long commercial . Well , I did it . I got up . What a man . I went over to the couch and here I am kneeling beside the couch with my hands down on it and my face in my hands , crying . Then I prayed and despised myself for praying . Grade Three drunk despising himself . What the hell are you praying to , you fool ? If a well man prays , that 's faith . A sick man prays and he is just scared . Nuts to prayer . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by yourself and what little outside help you got  --  well you made that too . Stop praying , you jerk . Get up on your feet and take that drink . It 's too late for anything else now . Well , I took it . Both hands . Poured it in the glass too . Hardly spilled a drop . Now if I can hold it without vomiting . Better add some water . Now lift it slow . Easy , not too much at a time . It gets warm . It gets hot . If I could stop sweating . The glass is empty . It 's down on the table again . There 's a haze over the moonlight but I set that glass down in spite of it , carefully , carefully , like a spray of roses in a tall vase . The roses nod their heads with dew . Maybe I 'm a rose . Brother , have I got dew . Now to get upstairs . Maybe a short one straight for the journey . No ? Okay , whatever you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get there , something to look forward to . If I make it upstairs I am entitled to com- pensation . A token of regard from me to me . I have such a beautiful love for myself  --  and the sweet part of it  --  no rivals . Double space . Been up and came down . Did n't like it up- stairs . The altitude makes my heart flutter . But I keep hitting these typewriter keys . What a magician is the subconscious . If only it would work regular hours . There was moonlight upstairs too . Probably the same moon . No variety about the moon . It comes and goes like the milkman and the moon 's milk is always the same . The milk 's moon is always  --  hold it , chum . You 've got your feet crossed . This is no time to get involved in the case history of the moon . You got enough case history to take care of the whole damn valley . She was sleeping on her side without sound . Her knees drawn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound when you sleep . Maybe not asleep , maybe just trying to sleep . If I went closer I would know . Might fall down too . One of her eyes opened  --  or did it ? She looked at me or did she ? No . Would have sat up and said , Are you sick , darling ? Yes , I am sick , darling . But do n't give it a thought , darling , because this sick is my sick and not your sick , and let you sleep still and lovely and never remember and no slime from me to you and You 're a louse , Wade . Three adjectives , you lousy writer . Ca n't you even stream-of-consciousness you louse without get- ting it in three adjectives for Chrissake ? I came downstairs again holding on to the rail . My guts lurched with the steps and I held them together with a promise . I made the main floor and I made the study and I made the couch and I waited for my heart to slow down . The bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that is grim and gray and ugly. say about Wade 's arrangements the bottle is always handy . Nobody hides it , nobody locks it up . Nobody says , Do n't you think you 've had enough , darling ? You 'll make yourself sick , darling . Nobody says that . Just , sleep on side softly like loses . I gave Candy too much money . Mistake . Should have started him with a bag of peanuts and worked up to a banana . ' Then a little real change , slow and easy , always keep him eager . You give him a big slug of the stuff to begin with and pretty soon he has a stake . He can live in Mexico for a month , live high wide and nasty , on what it costs here for a day . So when he gets that stake , what does he do ? Well , does a man ever have enough money , if he thinks he can get more ? Maybe it 's all right . Maybe I ought to kill the shiny-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not a cockroach in a white jacket ? Forget Candy . There 's always a way to blunt a needle . The other I shall never forget . It 's carved on my liver in green fire . Better telephone . Losing control . Feel them jumping , jump-ing , jumping . Better call someone quick before the pink things crawl on my face . letter call , call , call . Call Sioux City Sue . Hello , Operator , give me Long Distance . Hello , Long Distance , get me Sioux City Sue . What 's her number ? No have number , just name , Operator . You 'll find her walking along Tenth Street , on the shady side , under the tall corn trees with their spreading ears . . . . All right , Operator , all right . Just cancel the whole program and let me tell you something , I mean , ask you something . Who 's going to pay for all those snazzy parties Gifford is throwing in London , if you cancel my long distance call ? Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , I better talk to Gifford direct . Get him on the line . His valet just brought in his tea . If he ca n't talk we 'll send over somebody that can . Now what did I write that for ? What was I trying not to think about ? Telephone . Better telephone now . Getting very bad , very , very .. . That was all . I folded the sheets up small and pushed them down into my inside breast pocket behind the note case . I went over to the french windows and opened them wide and stepped out onto the terrace . The moonlight was a little spoiled . But it was summer in Idle Valley and summer is never quite spoiled . I stood there looking at the motionless colorless lake and thought and wondered . Then I heard a shot.  |p173ON  THE BALCONY two lighted doors were open now  --  Eileen 's and his . Her room was empty . There was a sound of struggling from his and I came through the door in a jump to find her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleam of a gun shot up into the air , two hands , a large male hand and a woman 's small hand were both holding it , neither by the butt . Roger was sitting up in bed and leaning forward pushing . She was in a pale blue house coat , one of those quilted things , her hair was all over her face and now she had both hands on the gun and with a quick jerk she got it away from him . I was surprised that she had the strength , even dopey as he was . He fell back glaring and panting and she stepped away and bumped into me . She stood there leaning against me , holding the gun with both hands pressed hard against her body . She was racked with panting sobs . I reached around her body and put my hand on the gun . She spun around as if it took that to make her realize I was there . Her eyes widened and her body sagged against me . She let go of the gun . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The barrel was warm . I held her with one arm , dropped the gun in my pocket , and looked past her head at him . Nobody said anything . Then he opened his eyes and that weary smile played on his lips . " Nobody hurt , " he muttered . " Just a wild shot into the ceiling . " I felt her go stiff . Then she pulled away . Her eyes were focused and clear . I let her go . " Roger , " she said in a voice not much more than a sick whisper , " did it have to be that ? " He stared owlishly , licked his lip and said nothing . She went and leaned against the dressing table . Her hand moved mechanically and threw the hair back from her face . She shuddered once from head to foot , shaking her head from side to side . " Roger , " she whispered again . " Poor Roger . Poor miserable Roger . " He was staring straight up at the ceiling now . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody with a knife was leaning over the bed . I do n't know who . Looked a little like Candy . Could n't of been Candy . " " Of course not , darling , " she said softly . She left the dressing table and sat down on the side of the bed . She put her hand out and began to stroke his forehead . " Candy has gone to bed long ago . And why would Candy have a knife ? " " He 's a Mex . They all have knives , " Roger said in the same remote impersonal voice . " They like knives . And he does n't like me . " " Nobody likes you , " I said brutally . She turned her head swiftly . " Please  --  please do n't talk like that . He did n't know . He had a dream  --  " " Where was the gun ? " I growled , watching her , not paying any attention to him . " Night table . In the drawer . " He turned his head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the drawer , and he knew I knew it . The pills had been in there and some odds and ends , but no gun . " Or under the pillow , " he added . " I 'm vague about it . I shot once  --  " he lifted a heavy hand and pointed  --  " up there . " I looked up . There seemed to be a hole in the ceiling plaster all right . I went where I could look up at it . Yes . The kind of hole a bullet might make . From that gun it would go on through , into the attic . I went back close to the bed and stood looking down at him , giving him the hard eye . " Nuts . You meant to kill yourself . You did n't have any night- mare . You were swimming in a sea of self-pity . You did n't have any gun in the drawer or under your pillow either . You got up and got the gun and got back into bed and there you were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think you had the nerve . You fired a shot not meant to hit anything . And your wife came running  --  that 's what you wanted . Just pity and sympathy , pal . Nothing else . Even the struggle was mostly fake . She . could n't take a gun away from you if you did n't want her tQ. " " 1 'm sick , " he said . " But you could be right . Does it matter ? " " It matters like this . They 'd put you in the psycho ward , and believe me , the people who run that place are about as sympathetic as Georgia chain-gang guards . " Eileen stood up suddenly . " That 's enough , " she said sharply . " He is sick , and you know it . " " He wants to be sick . I 'm just reminding him of what it would cost him . " " This is not the time to tell him . " " Go on back to your room . " Her blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on back to your room . Unless you want me to call the police . These things are supposed to be reported . " He almost grinned . " Yeah , call the police , " he said , " like you did on Terry Lennox . " I did n't pay any attention to that . I was still watching her . She looked exhausted now , and frail , and very beautiful . The moment of flashing anger was gone . I put a hand out and touched her arm . " It 's all right , " I said . " He . wo n't do it again . Go back to bed . " She gave him a long look and went out of the room . When the open door was empty of her I sat down on the side of the bed where she had been sitting . " More pills ? " " No thanks . It does n't matter whether I sleep . I feel a lot better . " " Did I hit right about that shot ? It was just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He turned his head away . " I guess I was light headed. , " " Nobody can stop you from killing yourself , if you really want to . I realize that . So do you . " " Yes . " He was still looking away . " Did you do what I asked you  --  that stuff in the typewriter ? " " Uh huh . I 'm surprised you remember . It 's pretty crazy writing . Funny thing , it 's clearly typed . " " I can always do that  --  drunk or sober  --  up to a point anyway . " " Do n't worry about Candy , " I said . " You 're wrong about his not liking you . And I was wrong to say nobody did . I was trying to ja Eileen , make her mad . " " Why ? " " She pulled one faint already tonight . "  | He shook his head slightly . " , Eileen never faints . " " Then , it was a phony , : He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good man died for you ? " I asked . He frowned , thinking about it . " Just rubbish . I told you I had a dream  --  " " I 'm talking about that guff you typed out . " He looked at me now , turning his head on the pillow as if it had enormous weight . " Another dream . " " I 'll try again . What 's Candy got on you ? " " Shove it , jack , " he said , and closed his eyes . I got up and closed the door . " You ca n't run forever , Wade . Candy could be a blackmailer , sure . Easy . He could even be nice about it  --  like you and lift your dough at the same time . What is it  --  a woman ? " " You believe that fool , Loring , " he said with his eyes closed . " Not exactly . What about the sister  --  the one that 's dead ? " It was a wild pitch in a sense but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide open . A bubble of saliva showed on his lips . " Is that  --  why you 're here ? " he asked slowly , and in a whisperingvoice . " You know better . I was invited . You invited me . " His head rolled back and forth on the pillow . In spite of the seconal he was eaten up by his nerves . His face was covered with sweat . Leave me alone , damn you . Leave me alone . " I went into the bathroom and got a face towel and wiped his face " I 'm not the first loving husband who has been an adulterer. off . I grinned at him sneeringly . I was the heel to end all heels . Wait until the man is down , then kick him and kick him again . He 's weak . He ca n't resist or kick back . " One of these days we 'll get together on it , " I said . " I 'm not crazy , " he said . " You just hope you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh sure . That 's obvious . The interesting point is why . Here  --  take this . " I had another seconal out of the night table and anotherglass of water . He got up on one elbow and grabbed for the glass and missed it by a good four inches . I put it in his hand . He man- aged to drink and swallow his pill . Then he lay back flat and de- flated , his face drained of emotion . His nose had that pinched look . He could almost have been a dead man . He was n't throwing any- body down any stairs tonight . Most likely not any night . When his eyelids got heavy I went out of the room . The weight of the Webley was against my hip , dragging at my pocket . I started back downstairs again . Eileen 's door was open . Her room was dark but there was enough light from the moon to frame her standing just inside the door . She called out something that sounded like a name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Keep your voice down , " I said . " He 's gone back to sleep . " " I always knew you would come back , " she said softly . " Even after ten years . " I peered at her . One of us was goofy . " Shut the door , " she said in the same caressing voice . " All these years I have kept myself for you . " I turned and shut the door . It seemed like a good idea at the moment . When I faced her she was already falling towards me . So I caught her . I damn well had to . She pressed herself hard against me and her hair brushed my face . Her mouth came up to be kissed . She was trembling . Her lips opened and her teeth opened and her tongue darted . Then her hands dropped and jerked at something and the robe she was wearing came open and underneath it she was as naked as September Morn but a darn sight less coy . " Put me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Putting my arms around her I touched bare skin , soft skin , soft yielding mesh . I lifted her and carried her the few steps to the bed and lowered her . She kept her arms around my neck . She was making some kind of a whistling noise in her throat . Then she thrashed about and moaned . , This was murder . I was as erotic as a stallion . I was losing control . You do n't get that sort of invita- tion from that sort of woman very often anywhere . Candy saved me . There was a thin squeak and I swung around to see the doorknob moving . I jerked loose and jumped for the door . I got it open and barged out through it and the Mex was tearing along the hall and down the stairs . Halfway down he stopped and turned and leered at me . Then he was gone.  |p178I  went back to the door and shut it  --  from the outside this time . Some kind of weird noises were coming from the woman on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weird noises . The spell was broken . I went down the stairs fast and crossed into the study and grabbed the bottle of Scotch and tilted it . When I could n't swallow any more I leaned against the wall and panted and let the stuff burn in me until the fumes reached my brain . It was a long time since dinner . It was a long time since anything that was normal . The whiskey hit me hard and fast and I kept guzzling it until the room started to get hazy and the furniture was all in the wrong places and the lamplight was like wildfire or sum- mer lightning . Then I was flat out on the leather couch , trying to balance the bottle on my chest . It seemed to be empty . It rolled away and thumped on the floor . That was the last incident of which I took any precise notice . A SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT tickled one of my ankles . I opened my eyes and saw the crown of a tree moving gently against a hazed blue sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axe split my head . I sat up . There was a rug over me . I threw that off and got my feet on the floor . I scowled at a clock . The clock said a minute short of six-thirty . I got up on my feet and it took character . It took will power . It took a lot out of me , and there was n't as much to spare as there once had been . The hard heavy years had worked me over . I plowed across to the half bath and stripped off my tie and shirt and sloshed cold water in my face with both hands and sloshed it on my head . When I was dripping wet I toweled myself off savagely . I put my shirt and tie back on and reached for my jacket and the gun in the pocket banged against the wall . I took it out and swungp179the cylinder away from the frame and tipped the cartridges into my hand , five full , one just a blackened shell . Then I thought , what 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put them back where they had been before and carried the gun into the study and put it away in one of the drawers of the desk . When I looked up Candy was standing in the doorway , spick and span in his white coat , his hair brushed back and shining black , his eyes bitter . " You want some coffee ? " " Thanks . " " I put the lamps out . The boss is okay . Asleep . I shut his door . Why you get drunk ? " " I had to . " He sneered at me . " Did n't make her , huh ? Got tossed out on your can , shamus . " " Have it your own way . " " You ai n't tough this morning , shamus . You ai n't tough at all . " " Get the goddam coffee , " I yelled at him . " Hijo de la puta ! " In one jump I had him by the arm . He did n't move . He just looked at me contemptuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're right , Candy . I 'm not tough at all . " He turned and went out . In no time at all he was back with a silver tray and a small silver pot of coffee on it and sugar and creamand a neat triangular napkin . He set it down on the cocktail table and removed the empty bottle and the rest of the drinking materials . He picked another bottle off the floor . " Fresh . Just made , " he said , and went out . I drank two cups black . Then I tried a cigarette . It was all right . I still belonged to the human race . Then Candy was back in the room again . " You want breakfast ? " he asked morosely . " No , thanks . " " Okay , scram out .. of here , We do n't want you around . " " Who 's we ? " He lifted the lid of a box and helped himself to a cigarette . He lit it and blew smoke at me insolently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said.  | " You making it pay ? " He frowned , then nodded . " Oh yes . Good money . " " How much on the side  --  for not spilling what you know ? " He went back to Spanish . " No entendido . " " You understand all right . How much you shake him for ? I bet it 's not more than a couple of yards . " " What 's that ? Couple of yards ? " " Two hundred bucks . " He grinned . " You give me couple of yards , shamus . So I do n't tell the boss you come out of her room last night . " " That would buy a whole busload of wetbacks like you . " He shrugged that off . " The boss gets pretty rough when he blows his top . Better pay up , shamus . " " Pachuco stuff , " I said contemptuously . " All you 're touching is the small money . Lots of men play around when they 're lit . Any- how she knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell . " There was a gleam in his eye . " Just do n't come round any more , tough boy . " " I 'm leaving . " I stood up and walked around the table . He moved enough to keep facing towards me . I watched his hand but he evidently was n't wearing a knife this morning . When I was close enough I slapped a hand across his face . " I do n't get called a son of a whore by the help , greaseball . I 've got business here and I come around whenever I feel like it . Watch your lip from now on . You might get pistol-whipped . That pretty face of yours would never look the same again . " He did n't react at all , not even to the slap . That and being called a greaseball must have been deadly insults to him . But this time he just stood there wooden-faced , motionless . Then without a word he picked up the coffee tray and carried it out . " Thanks for the coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . When he was gone I felt the bristles on my chin , shook myself , and decided to be on my way . I had had a skinful of the Wade family . As . I crossed the living room Eileen was coming down the stairs in white slacks and open-toed sandals and a pale blue shirt . She looked at me with complete surprise . " I did n't know you were here , Mr.p181Marlowe , " she said , as thought she had n't seen me for a week and at that time I had just dropped in for tea . " I put his gun in the desk , " I said . " Gun ? " Then it seemed to dawn on her . " Oh , last night was a little hectic , was n't it ? But I thought you had gone home . " I walked over closer to her . She had a thin gold chain around her neck and some kind of fancy pendant in gold and blue on white enamel . The blue enameled part looked like a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a broad white enamel and gold dagger that pierced a scroll . I could n't read the words . It wassome kind of military insigne . " I got drunk , " I said . " Deliberately and not elegantly . I was a little lonely . " " You did n't have to be , " she said , and her eyes were as clear as water . There was n't a trace of guile in them . " A matter of opinion , " I said . " I 'm leaving now and I 'm notsure I 'll be back . l ou heard what I said about the gun ? " " You put it in his desk . It might be a good idea to put it somewhere else . But he did n't really mean to shoot himself , did he ? " " I ca n't answer that . But next time he might . " She shook her head . " I do n't think so . I really do n't . You were a wonderful help last night , Mr. Marlowe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You made a pretty good try , " She got pink . Then she laughed . " I had a very curious dream in the night , " she said slowly , looking off over my shoulder . " Someone I used to know was here in the house . Someone who has been dead for ten years . " Her fingers went up and touched the gold and enamel pendant . " That 's why I am wearing this today . He gave it to me . " " I had a curious dream myself , " I said . " But I 'm not telling mine . Let me know how Roger gets on and if there is anything I can do . " She lowered her eyes and looked into mine . " You said you were not coming back . " " I said I was n't sure . I may have to come back . I hope I wo n't . There is something very wrong in this house . And only part of it came out of a bottle . " She stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " I think you know what I 'm talking about . " She thought it over carefully . Her fingers were still touching the pendant gently . She let out a slow patient sigh . " There 's always another woman , " she said quietly . " At some time or other . It 's not necessarily fatal . We 're talking at cross purposes , are n't we ? We are not even talking about the same thing , perhaps . " " Could be , " I said . She was still standing on the steps , the third step from the bottom . She still had her fingers on the pendant . She still looked like a golden dream . " Especially if you have in mind that the other woman is Linda Loring . " She dropped her hand from the pendant and came down one more step of the stairs . " Dr. Loring seems to agree with me , " she said indifferently . " He must have some source of information . " " You said he had played that scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did I ? Well  --  it was the conventional sort of thing to say at the time . " She came down another step . " I have n't shaved , " I said . That startled her . Then she laughed . " Oh , I was n't expecting you to make love to me . " " Just what did you expect of me , Mrs. Wade  --  in the beginning , when you first persuaded me to go hunting ? Why me  --  what have I got to offer ? " " You kept faith , " she said quietly . " When it could n't have been very easy . " " I 'm touched . But I do n't think that was the reason . " She came down the last step and then she was looking up at me . " Then what was the reason ? " " Or if it was  --  it was a damn poor reason . Just about the worst reason in the world . " She frowned a tiny frown . " Why ? " " Because what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool does n't do twice . " " You know , " she said lightly , " this is getting to be a very enigmaticconversation . " " You 're a very enigmatic person , Mrs. Wade . So long and goodp183luck and if you really care anything about Roger , you 'd better find him the right kind of doctor  --  and quick . " She laughed again . " Oh , that was a mild attack last night . You ought to see him in a bad one . He 'll be up and working by this afternoon . " " Like hell he will . " " But believe me he will . I know him so well . " I gave her the last shot right in the teeth and it sounded pretty nasty . " You do n't really want to save him , do you ? You just want to look as if you are trying to save him . " " That , " she said deliberately , " was a very beastly thing to say to me . " She stepped past me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big room was empty and I crossed to the front door and let myself out . It was a perfect summer morning in that bright secluded valley . It was too far from the city to get any smog and cut off by the low mountains from the dampness of the ocean . It was going to be hot later , but in a nice refined exclusive sort of way , nothing brutal like the heat of the desert , not sticky and rank like the heat of the city . Idle Valley was a perfect place to live . Perfect . Nice people with nice homes , nice cars , nice horses , nice dogs , possibly even nice children . But all a man named Marlowe wanted from it was out . And fast . I WENT HOME AND SHOWERED and shaved and changed clothes and began to feel clean again . I cooked some breakfast , ate it , washed up , swept the kitchen and the service porch , filled a pipe and called the phone answering service . I shot a blank . Why go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another dead moth and another layer of dust . In the safe would be my portrait of Madison . I could go down and play with that , and with the five crisp hundred dollar bills that still smelled of coffee . I could do that , but I did n't want to . Something inside me had gone sour . None of it really belonged to me . What was it supposed to buy ? How much loyalty can a dead man use ? Phooey : I was looking at life through the mists of a hangover . It was the kind of morning that seems to go on forever . I was flat and tired and dull and the passing minutes seemed to fall into a void , with a soft whirring sound , like spent rockets . Birds chirped in the shrubbery outside and the cars went up and down Laurel Canyon Boulevard endlessly . Usually I would n't even hear them . But I was brooding and irritable and mean and oversensitive . I de- cided to kill the hangover . Ordinarily I was not a morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You do n't metabolize fast enough . But I mixed a tall cold one this time and sat in an easy chair with my shirt open and pecked at a magazine , reading a crazy story about a guy that had two lives and two psychiatrists , one was human and one was some kind of insect in a hive . The guy kept going from one to the other and the whole thing was as crazy as a crumpet , but funny in an off-beat sort of way . I was handling the drink carefully , a sip at a time , watching myself . It was about noon when the telephone rang and the voice said : " This is Linda Loring . I called your office and your phone service told me to try your home . I 'd like to see you . " Why ? " " I 'd rather explain that in person . You go to your office from time to time , I suppose . " " Yeah . From time to time . Is there any money in it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I have no objection , if you want to be paid . I could be at your office in about an hour . " " What 's the . matter with you ? ' . ' she asked sharply . " Hangov , . But I 'm not paralyzed . I 'll be there . Unless you 'd rather come here . " " Your office would suit me better . "  | " I 've got a nice quiet place here . Dead-end street , no near neighbors . " " The implication does not attract me  --  if I understand you . " " Nobody understands me , , Mrs. Loring . I 'm enigmatic . Okay , I 'll struggle down to the coop . " " Thank you so much . " She hung up . I was slow getting down there because I stopped on the way for a sandwich . I aired out the office and switched on the buzzer and poked my head through the communicating door and she was there already , sitting in the same chair where Mendy Menendez had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine . She had a tan gabardine suit on today and she looked pretty elegant . She put the magazine aside , gave me a serious look and said : " Your Boston fern needs watering . I think it needs repotting too . Too many air roots . " I held the door open for her . The hell with the Boston fern . When she was inside and I had let the door swing shut I held the customer 's chair for her and she gave the office the usual once-over . I got around to my side of the desk . " You 're establishment is n't exactly palatial , " she said . " Do n't you even have a secretary ? " " It 's a sordid life , but I 'm used to it . " " And I should n't think very lucrative , " she said . " Oh I do n't know . Depends . Want to see a portrait of Madison ? " " A what ? " " A five-thousand-dollar bill . Retainer . I 've got it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I spun the knob and opened it and unlocked a drawer inside , opened an envelope , and dropped it in front of her . She stared at it in something like amazement . " Do n't let the office fool you , " I said . " I worked for an old boy one time that would cash in at about twenty millions . liven your old man would say hello to him . His office was no better than mine , except he was a bit deaf and had that soundproofing stuff on the ceiling . On the floor brown linoleum , no carpet . " She picked the portrait of Madison up and pulled it between her fingers and turned it over . She put it down again . " You got this from Terry , did n't you ? " " Gosh , you know everything , do n't you Mrs. Loring ? "  |p186She  pushed the bill away from her , frowning . " He had one . He carried it on him ever since he and Sylvia were married the second time . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his body . " " There could be other reasons for that . " " I know . But how many people carry a five-thousand-dollar bill around with them ? How many who could afford to give you that much money would give it to you in this form ? " It was n't worth answering . I just nodded . She went on brusquely . " And what were you supposed to do for it , Mr. Marlowe ? Or would you tell me ? On that last ride down to Tijuana he had plenty of time to talk . You made it very clear the other evening that you did n't believe his confession . Did he give you a list of his wife 's lovers so that you might find a murderer among them ? " I did n't answer that either , but for different reasons . " And would the name of Roger Wade appear on that list by any chance ? " she asked harshly . " If Terry did n't kill his wife , the murderer would have to be some violent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only that sort of man could , to use your own repulsive phrase , beat her face into a bloody sponge . Is that why you are making yourself so very useful to the Wades  --  a regular mother 's helper who comes on call to nurse him when he is drunk , to find him when he is lost , to bring him home when he is helpless ? " " Let me set you right on a couple of points , Mrs. Loring . Terry may or may not have given me that beautiful piece of engraving . But he gave me no list and mentioned no names . There was nothing he asked me to do except what you seem to feel sure I did do , drive him to Tijuana . My getting involved with the Wades was the work of a New York publisher who is desperate to have Roger Wade finish his book , which involves keeping him fairly sober , which in turn involves finding out if there is any special trouble that makes him get drunk . If there is and it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort to remove it . I say effort , because the chances are you could n't do it . But you could try . " " I could tell you in one simple sentence why he gets drunk , " she said contemptuously . " That anemic blond show piece he 's married to . " " Oh I do n't know , " I said . " I would n't call her anemic. "  | " Really ? How interesting . " Her eyes glittered . I picked up my portrait of Madison . " Do n't chew too long on that one , Mrs. Loring . I am not sleeping with the lady . Sorry to dis- appoint you . " I went over to the safe and put my money away in the locked compartment . I shut the safe and spun the dial . " On second thought , " she said to my back , " I doubt very much that anyone is sleeping with her . " I went back and sat on the corner of the desk . " You 're getting bitchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torch for our alco- holic friend ? " " I hate remarks like that , " she said bitingly . " I hate them . I sup- pose that idiotic scene my husband made makes you think you have the right to insult me . No , I am not carrying a torch for Roger Wade . I never did  --  even when he was a sober man who behaved himself . Still less now that he is what he is . " I flopped into my chair , reached for a matchbox , and stared at her . She looked at her watch . " You people with a lot of money are really something , " I said . " You think anything you choose to say , however nasty , is perfectly all right . You can make sneering remarks about Wade and his wife to a man you hardly know , but if I hand you back a little change , that 's an insult . Okay , let 's play it low down . Any drunk will eventually turn up with a loose woman . Wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . That 's just a casual suggestion your high-bred husband drops to brighten up a cocktail party . He does n't mean it , he 's just saying it for laughs . So we rule you out , and look for a loose woman elsewhere . How far do we have to look , Mrs. Loring  --  to find one that would involve you enough to bring you down here trading sneers with me ? It has to be somebody rather special , does n't it  --  otherwise why should you care ? " She sat perfectly silent , just looking . A long half minute went by . The corners of her mouth were white and her hands were rigid on her gabardine bag that matched her suit . " You have n't exactly wasted your time , have you ? " she said at last . " How convenient that this publisher should have thought of employing you ! So Terry named no names to you ! Not a name . Butp188it really did n't matter , did it , Mr. Marlowe ? Your instinct was un- erring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Nothing . " " Why , what a waste of talent ! How can you reconcile it with your obligation to your portrait of Madison ? Surely there must be some- thing you can do . " " Just between the two of us , " I said , " you 're getting pretty corny . So Wade knew your sister . Thanks for telling me , however in- directly . I already guessed it . So what ? He 's just one of what was most likely a fairly rich collection . Let 's leave it there . And let'sget around to why you wanted to see me . That kind of got lost in the shuffle , did n't it ? " She stood up . She glanced at her watch once more . " I have a car downstairs . Could I prevail upon you to drive home with me and drink a cup of tea ? " " Go on , " I said . " Let 's have it . " " Do I sound so suspicious ? I have a guest who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man ? " " I do n't call him that , " she said evenly . I stood up and leaned across the desk . " Honey , you 're awful cutesometimes . You really are . Is it all right if I carry a gun ? " " Surely you 're not afraid of an old man . " She wrinkled her lipat me . " Why not ? I 'll bet you are  --  plenty . " She sighed . " Yes , I 'm afraid I am . I always have been . He can be rather terrifying . " " Maybe I 'd better take two guns , " I said , then wished I hadn't.  |p189IT  WAS THE DAMNDEST-LOOKING HOUSE I ever saw . It was a squaregray box three stories high , with a mansard roof , steeply sloped and broken by twenty or thirty double dormer windows with a lot of wedding cake decoration around them and between them . The en- trance had double stone pillars on each side but the cream of the joint was an outside spiral staircase with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been a view the whole length of the lake . The motor yard was paved with stone . What the place really seemed to need was a half mile of poplar-lined driveway and a ( leer park and a wild garden and a terrace on three levels and a few hundred roses outside the library window and a long green vista from every window ending in forest and silence and quiet empti- ness . What it had was a wall of fieldstone around a comfortable ten or fifteen acres , which is a fair hunk of real estate in our crowded little country . The driveway was lined with a cypress hedge trimmed round . There were all sorts of ornamental trees in clumps here and there and they did n't look like California trees . Imported stuff . Whoever built that place was trying to drag the Atlantic seaboard over the Rockies . He was trying hard , but he had n't made it . Amos , the middle-aged colored chauffeur , stopped the Caddy gently in front of the pillared entrance , hopped out , and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got out first and helped him hold it . I helped her get out . She had hardly spoken to me since we got into the car in front of my building . She looked tired and nervous . Maybe this idiotic hunk of architecture de- pressed her . It would have depressed a laughing jackass and made it coo like a mourning dove . " Who built this place ? " I asked her . " And who was he mad at ? " She finally smiled . " Had n't you seen it before ? " " Never been this far into the valley . " She walked me over to the other side of the driveway and pointed up . " The man who built it jumped out of that tower room and landed about where you are standing . He was a French count named La Tourelle and unlike most French counts he had a lot of money . His wife was Ramona Desborough , who was not exactly threadbare herself . In the silent-picture days she made thirty thou- sand a week . La Tourelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed to be a miniature of the Chateau de Blois . You know that , of course . " " Like the back of my hand , " I said . " I remember now . It was one of those Sunday paper stories once . She left him and he killed himself . There was some kind of queer will too , was n't there ? " She nodded . " He left his ex-wife a few millions for carfare and tied the rest up in a trust . The estate was to be kept on just as it was . Nothing was to be changed , the dining table was to be laid in style every night , and nobody was to be allowed inside the grounds except the servants and the lawyers . The will was broken , of course . Eventually the estate was carved up to some extent and when I married Dr. Loring my father gave it to me for a wedding present . It must have cost him a fortune merely to make it fit to live in again . I loathe it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay here , do you ? " She shrugged in a tired sort of way . " Part of the time , at least . One of his daughters has to show him some sign of stability . Dr. Loring likes it here . " " He would . Any guy who could make the kind of scene he made at Wade 's house ought to wear spats with his pajamas . " She arched her eyebrows . " Why , thank you for taking such an interest , Mr. Marlowe . But I think enough has been said on that subject . Shall we go in ? My father does n't like to be kept waiting . " We crossed the driveway again and went up the stone steps and half of the big double doors swung open noiselessly and an expen- sive and very snooty looking character stood aside for us to enter . The hallway was bigger than all the floor space in the house I was living in . It had a tesselated floor and there seemed to be stained- glass windows at the back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been able to see what else was there . From the hallway we went through some more double carved doors into a dim room that could n't have been less than seventy feet long . A man was sitting there waiting , silent . He stared at us coldly . " Am I late , Father ? " Mrs. Loring asked hurriedly . " This is Mr.p191Philip Marlowe . Mr. Harlan Potter . " The man just looked at me and moved his chin down about half an inch . " Ring for tea , " he said . " Sit down , Mr. Marlowe . " I sat down and looked at him . He looked at me like an ento- mologist looking at a beetle . Nobody said anything . There was complete silence until the tea came . It was put down on a huge silver tray on a Chinese table . Linda sat at a table and poured . " Two cups , " Harlan Potter said . " You can have your tea in an- other room , Linda . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marlowe ? " " Any way at all , " I said . My voice seemed to echo off into the distance and get small and lonely . She gave the old man a cup and then gave me a cup . Then she stood up silently and went out of the room . I watched her go . 1 took a sip of tea and got a cigarette out . " Do n't smoke , please . I am subject to asthma . " I put the cigarette back in the pack . I stared at him . I do n't know how it feels to be worth a hundred million or so , but he did n't look as if he was having any fun . He was an enormous man , all of six feet five and built to scale . He wore a gray tweed suit with no padding . His shoulders did n't need any . He wore a white shirt and a dark tie and no display handkerchief . A spectacle case showed in the outside breast pocket . It was black , like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . It was brushed sideways acrosshis skull in a MacArthur sweep . And I had a hunch there was nothing under it but bare skull . His eyebrows were thick and black . His voice seemed to come from a long way off . He drank his tea as if he hated it . " It will save time , Mr. Marlowe , if I put my position before you . I believe you are interfering in my affairs . If I am correct , I pro- pose to stop it . " " I do n't know enough about your affairs to interfere in them , Mr. Potter . " " I disagree . " He drank some more tea and put the cup aside . He leaned back in the big chair he was sitting in and took me to pieces with his hard gray eyes.  | " I know who you are , naturally . And how you make your liv- ing  --  if you make one  --  and how you became involved with Terry Lennox . It has been reported to me that you helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts about his guilt , and that you have since made contact with a man who was known to my dead daughter . For what purpose has not been explained to me . Explain it . " " If the man has a name , " I said , " name it . " He smiled very slightly but not as if he was falling for me . " Wade . Roger Wade . Some sort of writer , I believe . A writer , they tell me , of rather prurient books which I should not be interested to read . I further understand that this man is a dangerous alcoholic . That may have given you a strange notion . " " Maybe you had better let me have my own notions , Mr. Potter . They are not important , naturally , but they 're all I have . First , I do not believe Terry killed his wife , because of the way it was done and because I do n't think he was that kind of man . Second , I did n't make contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do what I could to keep him sober while he finished a job of writing . Third , if he is a dangerous alcoholic , I have n't seen any sign of it . Fourth , my first contact was at the request of his New York pub- lisher and I did n't at that time have any idea that Roger Wade even knew your daughter . Filth , I refused this offer of employ- ment and then Mrs. Wade asked me to find her husband who was away somewhere taking a cure . I found him and took him home . " " Very methodical , " he said dryly . " I 'm not finished being methodical , Mr. Potter . Sixth  --  you or someone on your instructions sent a lawyer named Sewell Endicott to get me out of jail . He did n't say who sent him , but there was n't anyone else in the picture . Seventh , when I got out of jail a hood- lum named Mendy Menendez pushed me around and warned me to keep my nose clean and gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and the life of a gambler at Las Vegas named Randy Starr . The story could be true for all I know . Menendez pretended to be sore that Terry had n't asked him for help getting to Mexico and had asked a punk like me instead . He , Menendez , could have done it two ways from the jack by lifting one finger , and done it much better . "  | " Surely , " Harlan Potter said with a bleak smile , " you are not under the impression that I number Mr. Menendez and Mr. Starr among my acquaintances . " " I would n't know , Mr. Potter . A man does n't make your kind of money in any way I can understand . The next person to warn me off the courthouse lawn was your daughter , Mrs. Loring . We met by accident at a bar and we spoke because we were both drinking gimlets , Terry 's favorite drink , but an uncommon one around here . I did n't know who she was until she told me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she gave me the idea that I would have a short unhappy career if I got you mad . Are you mad , Mr. Potter ? " " When I am , " he said coldly , " you will not have to ask me . You will be in no uncertainty about it . " " What I thought . I 've been kind of expecting the goon squad to drop around , but they have n't shown so far . I have n't been both- ered by the cops either . I could have been . I could have been given a rough time . I think all you wanted , Mr. Potter , was quiet . Just what have I done to disturb you ? " He grinned . It was a sour kind of grin , but it was a grin . He put his long yellow fingers together and crossed a leg over his kneeand leaned back comfortably . " A pretty good pitch , Mr. Marlowe , and I have let you make it . Now listen to me . You are exactly right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite possible that your connection with the Wades may be incidental , accidental , and coincidental . Let it remain so . I am a family man in an age when it means almost nothing . One of my daughters married a Bostonian prig and the other made a number of foolish marriages , the last being with a complaisant pauper who allowed her to live a worthless and immoral life until he suddenly and for no good reason lost his self-control and mur- dered her . You think that impossible to accept because of the brutality with which it was done . You are wrong . Ile shot her with a Mauser automatic , the very gun he took with him to Mexico . And after he shot her he did what he did in order to cover the bullet wound . I admit the brutality of this , but remember the man had been in a war , had been badly wounded , had suffered a great deal and seen others suffer . He may not have intended to kill her . There may have been some sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a small but powerful gun , 7.65 m/m caliber , a model called P.P.K. The bullet went completely through her head and lodged in the wall behind a chintz curtain . It was not found im- mediately and the fact was not published at all . Now let us con- sider the situation . " He broke off and stared at me . " Are you very badly in need of a cigarette ? " " Sorry , Mr. Potter . I took it out without thinking . Force of habit . " I put the cigarette back for the second time . " Terry had just killed his wife . He had ample motive from the rather limited police point of view . But he also had an excellent defense  --  that it was her gun in her possession and that he tried to take it away from her and failed and she shot herself with it . A good trial lawyer could have done a lot with that . He would prob- ably have been acquitted . If he had called me up then , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal affair to cover the traces of the bullet , he made it impossible . He had to run away and even that he did clumsily . " " He certainly did , Mr. Potter . But he called you up in Pasadena first , did n't he ? He told me he did . " The big man nodded . " 1 told him to disappear and I would still see what I could do . I did n't want to know where he was . That was imperative . I could not hide a criminal . " " Sounds good , Mr. Potter . " " Do I detect a note of sarcasm ? No matter . When I learned the details there was nothing to be done . I could not permit the sort of trial that kind of killing would result in . To be frank , I was very glad when I learned that he had shot himself in Mexico and left a confession . " " I can understand that , Mr. Potter . " He beetled his eyebrows at me . " Be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you understand now that I can not tolerate any further investigation of any sort by any person ? And why I have used all my influence to make what investigation there was as brief as possible and as little publicized as possible ? " " Sure  --  if you 're convinced he killed her . " " Of course he killed her . With what intent is another matter . It is no longer important . I am not a public character and I do not intend to be . I have always gone to a great deal of trouble to avoid any kind of publicity . I have influence but I do n't abuse it . The District Attorney of Los Angeles County is an ambitious man who has too much good sense to wreck his career for the notoriety of the moment . I see a glint in your eye , Marlowe . Get rid of it . We live in what is called a democracy , rule by the majority of the people . A fine ideal if it could be made to work . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party machines to be effective must spend a great deal of money . Somebody has to give it to them , and that somebody , whether it be an individual , a financial group , a trade union or what have you , expects some consideration iii re- turn . What I and people of my kind expect is to be allowed to live our lives in decent privacy . I own newspapers , but I do n't like them . I regard them as a constant menace to whatever privacy we have left . Their constant yelping about a free press means , with a few honorable exceptions , freedom to peddle scandal , crime , sex , sensationalism , hate , innuendo , and the political and financial uses of propaganda . A newspaper is a business out to make money through advertising revenue . That is predicated on its circulation and you know what the circulation depends on . " I got up and walked around my chair . He eyed me with cold attention . I sat down again . I needed a little luck . Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Potter , what goes from here ? " He was n't listening . He was frowning at his own thoughts . " There 's a peculiar thing about money , " he went on . " In large quantities it tends to have a life of its own , even a conscience of its own . The power of money becomes very difficult to control . Man has always been a venal animal . The growth of populations , the huge costs of wars , the incessant pressure of confiscatory taxation  --  all these things make him more and more venal . The average man is tired and scared , and a tired , scared man ca n't afford ideals . he has to buy food for his family . In our time we have seen a shocking decline in both public and private morals . You ca n't expect quality from people whose lives are a subjection to a lack of quality . You ca n't have quality with mass production . You do n't want it be- cause it lasts too long . So you substitute styling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial obsolescence . Mass production could n't sell its goods next year unless it made whatp196it sold this year look unfashionable a year from now . We have the whitest kitchens and the most shining bathrooms in the world . But in the lovely white kitchen the average American housewife ca n't produce a meal fit to eat , and the lovely shining bathroom is mostly a receptacle for deodorants , laxatives , sleeping pills , and the products of that confidence racket called the cosmetic industry . We make the finest packages in the world , Mr. Marlowe . The stuff inside is mostly junk . " He took out a large white handkerchief and touched his temples with it . I was sitting there with my mouth open , wondering what made the guy tick . He hated everything . " It 's a little too warm for me in these parts , " he said . " I 'm used toa cooler climate . I 'm beginning to sound like an editorial that has forgotten the point it wanted to make . " " I got your point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the world is going so you use what power you have to close off a private corner to live in as near as possible to the way you remem- ber people lived fifty years ago before the age of mass production . You 've got a hundred million dollars and all it has bought you is a pain in the neck . " He pulled the handkerchief taut by two opposite corners , then crumpled it into a ball and stuffed it in a pocket . " And then ? " he asked shortly . " That 's all there is , there is n't any more . You do n't care who murdered your daughter , Mr. Potter . You wrote her off as a bad job long ago . Even if Terry Lennox did n't kill her , and the real murderer is still walking around free , you do n't care . You would n't want him caught , because that would revive the scandal and there would have to be a trial and his defense would blow your privacy as high as the Empire State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to commit suicide , before there was any trial . Pref- erably in Tahiti or Guatemala or the middle of the Sahara Desert . Anywhere where the County would hate the expense of sending a man to verify what had happened . " He smiled suddenly , a big rugged smile with a reasonable amount of friendliness in it . " What do you want from me , Marlowe ? " " lf you mean how much money , nothing . I did n't ask myselfp197here . I was brought . I told the truth about how I met Roger Wade . But he did know your daughter and he does have a record of vio- lence , although I have n't seen any of it . Last night the guy tried to shoot himself . He 's a haunted man . He has a massive guilt com- plex . If I happened to be looking for a good suspect , he might do . I realize he 's only one of many , but he happens to be the only one I 've met . " He stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He came over and stood in front of me . " A telephone call , Mr. Marlowe , would deprive you of your license . Do n't fence with me . I wo n't put up with it . " " Two telephone calls and I 'd wake up kissing the gutter  --  with the back of my head missing . " He laughed harshly . " I do n't operate that way . I suppose in your quaint line of business it is natural for you to think so . I 've given you too much of my time . I 'll ring for the butler to show you out . " " Not necessary , " I said , and stood up myself . " I came here and got told . Thanks for the time . " He held his hand out . " Thank you for coming . I think you 're a pretty honest sort of fellow . Do n't be a hero , young man . There 's no percentage in it . " I shook hands with him . He had a grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . He was Mr. Big , the winner , every- thing under control . " One of these days I might be able to throw some business your way , " he said . " And do n't go away thinking that I buy politicians or law enforcement officers . I do n't have to . Goodbye , Mr. Mar- lowe . And thank you again for coming . " He stood there and watched me out of the room . 1 had my hand on the front door when Linda Loring popped out of a shadow somewhere . " Well ? " she asked me quietly . " How did you get on with Father ? " " Fine . He explained civilization to me . I mean how it looks to him . He 's going to let it go on for a little while longer . But it better be careful and not interfere with his private life . If it does , he 's apt to make a phone call to God and cancel the order . " " You 're hopeless , " she said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a look at your old man . Compared with him I 'm a blue-eyed baby with a brand new rattle . " I went on out and Amos had the Caddy there waiting . He drove me back to Hollywood . I offered him a buck but he would n't take it . I offered to buy him the poems of T. S. Eliot . He said he al- ready had them . A WEEK . WENT BY and I heard nothing from the Wades . The weather was hot and sticky and the acid sting of the smog had crept as far west as Beverly Hills . From the top of Mulholland Drive you could see it leveled out all over the city like a ground mist . When you were in it you could taste it and smell it and it made your eyes smart . Everybody was griping about it . In Pasadena , where the stuffy millionaires holed up alter Beverly Hills was spoiled for them by the movie crowd , the city fathers screamed with rage . Everything was the fault of the smog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk- man was late , if the Pekinese had fleas , if an old coot in a starched collar had a heart attack on the way to church , that was the smog . Where I lived it was usually clear in the early morning and nearly always at night . Once in a while a whole day would be clear , no- body quite knew why . It was on a day like that  --  it happened to be a Thursday  --  that Roger Wade called me up . " How are you ? This is Wade . " He sounded fine . " Fine , and you ? " " Sober , I 'm afraid . Scratching a hard buck . We ought to have a talk . And I think I owe you some dough . " " Nope . " " Well , how about lunch today ? Could you make it here some- where around one ? "  | " I guess so . How 's Candy ? " " Candy ? " He sounded puzzled . He must have blacked out plenty that night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night . " " Yeah . He 's a helpful little guy  --  in spots . And Mrs. Wade ? " " She 's fine too . She 's in town shopping today . " We hung up and I sat and rocked in my swivel chair . I ought to have asked him how the book was going . Maybe you always ought to ask a writer how the book is going . And then again maybe he gets damned tired of that question . I had another call in a little while , a strange voice . " This is Roy Ashterfelt . George Peters told me to call you up , Marlowe . " " Oh yes , thanks . You 're the fellow that knew Terry Lennox in New York . Called himself Marston then . " " That 's right . He was sure on the sauce . But it 's the same guy all right . You could n't very well mistake him . Out here I saw him in Chasen 's one night with his wife . I was with a client . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client 's name , I 'm afraid . " " I understand . It 's not very important now , I guess . What was his first name ? " " Wait a minute while I bite my thumb . Oh yeah , Paul . Paul Marston . And there was one thing more , if it interests you.He was wearing a British Army service badge . Their version of the rup- tured duck . " " I see . What happened to him ? " too  --  married to Harlan Potter 's somewhat wild daughter . But you know all that . " " I do n't know . I came west . Next time I saw him he was here " They 're both dead now . But thanks for telling me . " " Not at all . Glad to help . Does it mean anything to you ? " " Not a thing , " I said , and I was a liar . " I never asked him about himself . He told me once he had been brought up in an orphan- age . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With that white hair and that scarred face , brother ? Not a chance . I wo n't say I never forget a face , but not that one . " " Did he see you ? " " If he did , he did n't let on . Hardly expect him to in the cir- cumstances . Anyhow he might not have remembered me . Like Ip200said , he was always pretty well lit back in New York . " I thanked him some more and he said it was a pleasure and we hung up . I thought about it for a while . The noise of the traffic outside thebuilding on the boulevard made an unmusical obbligato to my thinking . It was too loud . In summer in hot weather everything is too loud . I got up and shut the lower part of the window and called Detective-Sergeant Green at Homicide . He was obliging enough to be in . " Look , " I said , after the preliminaries , " I heard something about Terry Lennox that puzzles me . A fellow I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . You check his war record ? " " You guys never learn , " Green said harshly . " You just never learn to stay on your own side of the street . That matter is closed , locked up , weighted with lead and dropped in the ocean . Get it ? " " I spent part of an afternoon with Harlan Potter last week at his daughter 's house in Idle Valley . Want to check ? " " Doing what ? " he asked sourly . " Supposing I believe you . " " Talking things over . I was invited . He likes me . Incidentally , he told me the girl was shot with a Mauser P.P.K. 7.65 m/m . That news to you ? " " Go on . " " Her own gun , chum . Makes a little difference , maybe . But do n't get me wrong . I 'm not looking into any dark corners . This is a personal matter . Where did he get that wound ? " Green was silent . I heard a door close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably in a knife fight south of the border . " " Aw hell , Green , you had his prints . You sent them to Wash- ington like always . You got a report back  --  like always . All I asked was something about his service record . " " Who said he had one ? " " Well , Mendy Menendez for one . Seems Lennox saved his life one time and that 's how he got the wound . He was captured by the Germans and they gave him the face he had . " " Menendez , huh ? You believe that son of a bitch ? You got a hole in your own head . Lennox did n't have any war record . Did n't have any record of any kind under any name . You satisfied ? " " If you say so , " I said . " But I do n't see why Menendez wouldp201bother to come up here and tell me a yarn and warn me to keep my nose clean on account of Lennox was a pal of him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooling around . After all Lennox was already dead . " " Who knows what a hoodlum figures ? " Green asked bitterly . " Or why ? Maybe Lennox was in a racket with them before he married all that money and got respectable . He was a floor manager at Starr 's place in Vegas for a while . That 's where he met the girl . A smile and a bow and a dinner jacket . Keep the customers happy and keep an eye on the house players . I guess he had class for the job . " " He had charm , " I said . " They do n't use it in police business . Much obliged , Sergeant . How is Captain Gregorius these days ? " " Retirement leave . Do n't you read the papers ? " " Not the crime news , Sergeant . Too sordid . " I started to say goodbye but he chopped me off . " What did Mr. Money want with you ? " " We just had a cup of tea together . A social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . He also hinted  --  just hinted , not in so many words  --  that any cop that looked cross-eyed at me would be facing a grimy future . " " He do n't run the police department , " Green said . " He admits it . Does n't even buy commissioners or D.A . ' s , he said . They just kind of curl up in his lap when he 's having a doze . " " Go to hell , " Green said , and hung up in my ear . A difficult thing , being a cop . You never know whose stomach it 's safe to jump up and down on . THE STRETCH OF BROKEN-PAVED ROAD from the highway to the curveof the hill was dancing in the noon heat and the scrub that dotted the parched land on both sides of it was flour-white with granite dust by this time . The weedy smell was almost nauseating . A thin hot acrid breeze was blowing . I had my coat off and my sleeves rolled up , but the door was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozed wearily under a clump of live oaks . A brown Mexican sat on the ground and ate something out of a newspaper . A tumble- weed rolled lazily across the road and came to rest against a piece of granite outcrop , and a lizard that had been there an instant before disappeared without seeming to move at all . Then I was around the hill on the blacktop and in another country . In five minutes I turned into the driveway of the Wades ' house , parked and walked across the flagstones and rang the bell . Wade answered the door himself , in a brown and white checked shirt with short sleeves , pale blue denim slacks , and house slippers . He looked tanned and he looked good . There was an inkstain on his hand and a smear of cigarette ash on one side of his nose . He led the way into his study and parked himself behind his desk . On it there was a thick pile of yellow typescript . I put my coat on a chair and sat on the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got that look on my face you get when a drunk asks you to have a drink . I could feel it . He grinned . " I 'll have a coke , " he said . " You pick up fast , " I said . " I do n't think I want a drink right now . I 'll take a coke with you . " He pressed something with his foot and after a while Candy came . He looked surly . He had a blue shirt on and an orange scarf and no white coat . Two-tone black and white shoes , elegant high- waisted gabardine pants . Wade ordered the cokes . Candy gave me a hard stare and went away . " Book ? " I said , pointing to the stack of paper . " Yeah . Stinks . " " I do n't believe it . How far along ? " " About two thirds of the way  --  for what it 's worth . Which is damn little . You know how a writer can tell when he 's washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I filled my pipe.  | " When he starts reading his old stuff for inspiration . That 's ab- solute . I 've got five hundred pages of typescript here , well over a hundred thousand words . My books run long . The public likes long books . The damn fool public thinks if there 's a lot of pages there must be a lot of gold . I do n't dare read it over . And I ca n't remember half of what 's in it . I 'm just plain scared to look at my own work . " " You look good yourself , " I said . " From the other night I would n't have believed it . You 've got more guts than you think you have . " " What I need right now is more than guts . Something you do n't get by wishing for it . A belief in yourself . I 'm a spoiled writer who does n't believe any more . I have a beautiful home , a beautiful wife , and a beautiful sales record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forget . " He leaned his chin in his cupped hands and stared across the desk . " Eileen said I tried to shoot myself . Was it that bad ? " " You do n't remember ? " He shook his head . " Not a damn thing except that I fell down and cut my head . And after a while I was in bed . And you were there . Did Eileen call you ? " " Yeah . Did n't she say ? " " She has n't been talking to me very much this last week . I guess she 's had it . Up to here . " He put the edge of one hand against his neck just under his chin . " That show Loring put on here did n't help any . " " Mrs. Wade said it meant nothing . " " Well , she would , would n't she ? It happened to be the truth , but I do n't suppose she believed it when she said it . The guy is just abnormally jealous . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laugh a little and kiss her goodbye and right off he as- sumes you are sleeping with her . One reason being that he is n't . " " What I like about Idle Valley , " I said , " is that everybody is living just a comfortable normal life . " He frowned and then the door opened and Gandy came in with two cokes and glasses and poured the cokes . He set one in front ofp204me without looking at me . " Lunch in half an hour , " Wade said , " and where 's the white coat ? " " This my day off , " Candy said , deadpan . " I ai n't the cook , boss . " " Cold cuts or sandwiches and beer will do , " Wade said . " The cook 's off today , Candy . I 've got a friend to lunch . " " You think he is your friend ? " Candy sneered . " Better ask your wife . " Wade leaned back in his chair and smiled at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it soft here . I do n't often ask a favorof you , do I ? " Candy looked down at the floor . After a moment he looked up and grinned . " Okay , boss . I put the white coat on . I get the lunch , I guess . " He turned softly and went out . Wade watched the door close . Then he shrugged and looked at me . " We used to call them servants . Now we call them domestic help . I wonder how long it will be before we have to give them breakfast in bed . I 'm paying the guy too much money . He 's spoiled . " " Wages  --  or something on the side ? " " Such as what ? " he asked sharply . I got up and handed him some folded yellow sheets . " You 'd better read it . Evidently you do n't remember asking me to tear it up . It was in your typewriter , under the cover . " He unfolded the yellow pages and leaned back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk in front of him . He readslowly , frowning . When he came to the end he refolded the sheets and ran a finger along the edge . " Did Eileen see this ? " he asked carefully . " I would n't know . She might have . " " Pretty wild , is n't it ? " " I liked it . Especially the part about a good man dying for you . " He opened the paper again and tore it into long strips viciously and dumped the strips into his wastebasket . " I suppose a drunk will write or say or do anything , " he said slowly . " It 's meaningless to me . Candy 's not blackmailing me . He likes me. "  | " Maybe you 'd better get drunk again . You might remember what you meant . You might remember a lot of things . We 've been through this before  --  that night when the gun went off . I suppose the seconal blanked you out too . You sounded sober enough . But now you pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No wonder you ca n't write your book , Wade . It 's a wonder you can stay alive . " He reached sideways and opened a drawer of his desk . His hand fumbled in it and came up with a three-decker check book . He opened it and reached for a pen . " I owe you a thousand dollars , " he said quietly . He wrote in the book . Then on the counterfoil . He tore the check out , came around the desk with it , and dropped it in front of me . " Is that all right ? " I leaned back and looked up at him and did n't touch the check were deep and empty. and did n't answer him . His face was tight and drawn . His eyes " I suppose you think I killed her and let Lennox take the rap , " he said slowly . " She was a tramp all right . But you do n't beat a woman 's head in just because she 's a tramp . Candy knows I went there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think he would tell . I could be wrong , but I do n't think so . " " Would n't matter if he did , " I said . " Harlan Potter 's friends would n't listen to him . Also , she was n't killed with that bronze thing . She was shot through the head with her own gun . " " She maybe had a gun , " he said almost dreamily . " But I did n't know she had been shot . It was n't published . " " Did n't know or did n't remember ? " I asked him . " No , it was n't published . " " What are you trying to do to me , Marlowe ? " His voice was still dreamy , almost gentle . " What do you want me to do ? Tell my wife ? Tell the police ? What good would it do ? " " You said a good man died for you . " " All I meant was that if there had been any real investigation I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pos- sible suspects . It would have finished me in several ways . " " I did n't come here to accuse you of a murder , Wade . What 's eating you is that you 're not sure yourself . You have a record ofp206violence to your wife . You black out when you 're drunk . It 's no argument to say you do n't beat a woman 's head in just because she 's a tramp . That is exactly what somebody did do . And the guy who got credit for the job seemed to me a lot less likely than you . " He walked to the open french windows and stood looking out at the shimmer of heat over the lake . He did n't answer me . He had n't moved or spoken a couple of minutes later when there was a light knock at the door and Candy came in wheeling a tea wagon , with a crisp white cloth , silver-covered dishes , a pot of coffee , and two bottles of beer . " Open the beer , boss ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of whiskey . " Wade did n't turn around . " Sorry , boss . No whiskey . " Wade spun around and yelled at him , but Candy did n't budge . He looked down at the check lying on the cocktail table and his head twisted as he read it . Then he looked up at me and hissed something between his teeth . Then he looked at Wade . " I go now . This my day off . " He turned and went . Wade laughed . " So I get it myself , " he said sharply , and went . I lifted one of the covers and saw some neatly trimmed three- cornered sandwiches . I took one and poured some beer and ate the sandwich standing up . Wade came back with a bottle and a glass . He sat down on the couch and poured a stiff jolt and sucked it clown . There was the sound of a car going away from the house , probably Candy leaving by the service driveway . I took another sandwich . " Sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have all afternoon to kill . " He had a glow on already . His voice was vibrant and cheerful . " You do n't like me , do you , Marlowe ? " " That question has already been asked and answered . " " Know something ? You 're a pretty ruthless son of a bitch . You 'd do anything to find what you want . You 'd even make love to my wife while I was helpless drunk in the next room . " " You believe everything that knife thrower tells you ? " He poured some more whiskey into his glass and held it up against the light . " Not everything , no . A pretty color whiskey is , is n't it ? To drown in a golden flood  --  that 's not so bad . To ceasep207upon the midnight with no pain . ' How does that go on ? Oh , sorry , you would n't know . Too literary . You 're some kind of a dick , are n't you ? Mind telling me why you 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc . Then he spotted the check lying on the table . He reached for it and read it over his glass . " Seems to be made out to somebody named Marlowe . I wonder why , what for . Seems I signed it . Foolish of me . I 'm a gullible chap . " " Stop acting , " I said roughly . " Where 's your wife ? " No doubt by that time I shall be passed out and she can entertain He looked up politely . " My wife will be home in due course . you at her leisure . The house will be yours . " " Where 's the gun ? " I asked suddenly . He looked blank . I told him I had put it in his desk . " Not there now , I 'm sure , " he said . " You may search if it pleases you . Just do n't steal any rubber bands . " I went to the desk and frisked it . No gun . That was something . Probably Eileen had hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where your wife was . I think she ought to come home . Not for my benefit , friend , for yours . Some- body has to look out for you , and I 'll be goddamned if it 's going tobe me. " glass down and tore the check across , then again and again , and let the pieces fall to the floor . He stared vaguely . He was still holding the check . He put his " Evidently the amount was too small , " he said . " Your services isfy you . Too bad , but I ca n't go any higher . Except on this . " He patted the bottle. come very high . Even a thousand dollars and my wife fail to sat- " I 'm leaving , " I said . " But why ? You wanted me to remember . Well  --  here in the bottle is my memory . Stick around , pal . When l get lit enough I 'll tell you about all the women I have murdered . " " All right , Wade . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . If you need me , just smash a chair against the wall . " I went out and left the door open . I walked across the big living room and out to the patio and pulled one of the chaises into thep208shadow of the overhang and stretched out on it . Across the lake there was a blue haze against the hills . The ocean breeze had begun to filter through the low mountains to the west . It wiped the air clean and it wiped away just enough of the heat . Idle Valley was having a perfect summer . Somebody had planned it that way . Paradise Incorporated , and also Highly Restricted . Only the nicest people . Absolutely no Central Europeans . Just the cream , the top drawer crowd , the lovely , lovely people . Like the Lorings and the Wades . Pure gold . I LAY THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR trying to make up my mind what to do . Part of me wanted to let him get good and drunk and see if anything came out . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own study in his own house . He might fall down again but it would be a long time . The guy had capacity . And somehow a drunk never hurts himself very badly . He might get back his mood of guilt . More likely , this time he would just go to sleep . The other part of me wanted to get out and stay out , but this was the part I never listened to . Because if I ever had I would have stayed in the town where I was born and worked in the hardware store and married the boss 's daughter and had five kids and read them the funny paper on Sunday morning and smacked their heads when they got out of line and squabbled with the wife about how much spending money they were to get and what programs they could have on the radio or TV set . I might even have got rich  --  small-town rich , an eight-room house , two cars in the garage , chickenevery Sunday and the Reader 's Digest on the living room table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brain like a sack of Portland cement . You take it , friend . I 'll take the big sordid dirty crooked city . I got up and went back to the study . He was just sitting there staring at nothing , the Scotch bottle more than half empty , a loose frown on his face and a dull glitter in his eyes . He looked at me like a horse looking over a fence . " What d' you want ? " " Nothing . You all right ? " " Do n't bother me . I have a little man on my shoulder telling me stories . " I got another sandwich off the tea wagon and another glass of beer . I munched the sandwich and drank the beer , leaning against his desk . " Know something ? " he asked suddenly , and his voice suddenly seemed much more clear . " I had a male secretary once . Used to dictate to him . Let him go . He bothered me sitting there waiting for me to create . Mistake . Ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a homo . The clever boys that write book reviews because they ca n't write anything else would have caught on and started giving me the buildup . Have to take care of their own , you know . They 're all queers , every damn one of them . The queer is the artistic arbiter of our age , chum . The pervert is the top guy now . " " That so ? Always been around , has n't he ? " He was n't looking at me . He was just talking . But he heard what I said . " Sure , thousands of years . And especially in all the great ages of art . Athens , Rome , the Renaissance , the Elizabethan Age , the Ro- mantic Movement in France  --  loaded with them . Queers all over the place . Ever read The Golden Bough ? No , too long for you . Shorter version though . Ought to read it . Proves our sexual habits are pure conventions  --  like wearing a black tie with a dinner jacket . Me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight . " He looked up at me and sneered . " You know something ? I 'm a liar . My heroes are eight feet tall and my heroines have callouses on their bottoms from lying in bed with their knees up . Lace and ruffles , swords and coaches , elegance and leisure , duels and gallant death . All lies . They used perfume instead of soap , their teeth rotted because they never cleaned them , their fingernails smelled of stale gravy . The nobility of France urinated against the walls in the marble corridors of Versailles , and when you finally got several sets of underclothes off the lovely marquise the first thing you noticed was that she needed a bath . I ought to write it that way . " " Why do n't you ? " He chuckled . " Sure , and live in a five-room house in Compton  --  if I was that lucky . " He reached down and patted the whiskey bottle . " You 're lonely , pal . You need company . " He got up and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about nothing . A speedboat came racketing down the lake . When it came in sight I could see that it was high out of the water on its step and towing a surfboard with a husky sunburned lad on it . I went over to the french windows and watched it make a sweep- ing turn . Too fast , the speedboat almost turned over . The surf- board rider danced on one foot trying to hold his balance , then went shooting off into the water . The speedboat drifted to a stop and the man in the water came up to it in a lazy crawl , then went back along the tow rope and rolled himself on to the surfboard . Wade came back with another bottle of whiskey . The speedboat picked up and went off into the distance . Wade put his fresh bottle " Christ , you 're not going to drink all that , are you ? " He squinted his eyes at me . " Take off , buster . Go on home and down beside the other . He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're in my light . " His voice was thick again . He had taken a couple in the kitchen , as usual . " If you want me , holler . " " I could n't get low enough to want you . " " Yeah , thanks . I 'll be around until Mrs. Wade comes home . Ever hear of anybody named Paul Marston ? " His head came up slowly . His eyes focused , but with effort . I could see him fighting for control . Ile won the fight  --  for the moment . His face became expressionless . " Never did , " he said carefully , speaking very slowly . " Who 's he ? " The next time I looked in on him he was asleep , with his mouth open , his hair damp with sweat , and reeking of Scotch . His lips were pulled back from his teeth in a loose grimace and the furred sur- face of his tongue looked dry . One of the whiskey bottles was empty . A glass on the table had about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three quarters full . I put the empty on the tea wagon and rolled it out of the room , then went back to close the french windows and turn the slats of the blinds . The speedboat might come back and wake him . I shut the study door . I wheeled the tea wagon out to the kitchen , which was blue and white and large and airy and empty . I was still hungry . I ate another sandwich and drank what was left of the beer , then poured a cup of coffee and drank that . The beer was flat but the coffee was still hot . Then I went back to the patio . It was quite a long time before the speedboat came tearing down the lake again . It was almost four o'clock when I heard its distant roar swell into an ear- splitting howl of noise . There ought to be a law . Probably was and the guy in the speedboat did n't give a damn . He enjoyed making a nuisance of himself , like other people I was meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made it this time . The driver slowed just enough on the turn and the brown lad on the surfboard leaned far out against the centrifugal pull . The surfboard was almost out of the wa ter , but one edge stayed in and then the speedboat straightened out and the surfboard still had a rider and they went back the way they had come and that was that . The waves stirred up by the boat came charging in towards the shore of the lake at my feet . They slapped hard against the piles of the short landing and jumped the tied boat up and down . They were still slapping it around when I turned back to the house . As I reached the patio I heard a bell chiming from the direction of the kitchen . When it sounded again I decided that only the front door would have chimes . I crossed to it and opened it . Eileen Wade was standing there looking away from the house . As she turned she said : " I 'm sorry , I forgot my key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it was Roger or Candy . " " Candy is n't here . It 's Thursday . " She came in and I shut the door . She put a bag down on the table between the two davenports . She looked cool and also distant . She pulled off a pair of white pigskin gloves . " Is anything wrong ? " " Well , there 's a little drinking being done . Not bad . He 's asleep on the couch in his study . "  | " He called you ? " " Yes , but not for that . He asked me to lunch . I 'm afraid he did n't have any himself . " " Oh . " She sat down slowly on a davenport . " You know , I com- pletely forgot it was Thursday . The cook 's away too . How stupid . " " Candy got the lunch before he left . I guess I 'll blow now . I hope my car was n't in your way . " She smiled . " No . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm going to have some . " " All right . " I did n't know why I said that . I did n't want any tea . I just said it . She slipped off a linen jacket . She had n't worn a hat . " I 'll just look in and see if Roger is all right . " I watched her cross to the study door and open it . She stood there a moment and closed the door and came back . " He 's still asleep . Very soundly . I have to go upstairs for a moment . I 'll be right down . " I watched her pick up her jacket and gloves and bag and go up the stairs and into her room . The door closed . I crossed to the study with the idea of removing the bottle of hooch . If he was still asleep , he would n't need it . THE SHUTTING OF THE FRENCH WINDOWS had made the room stuffy and the turning of the venetian blinds had made it dim . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy a silence . It was not more than sixteen feet from the door to the couch and I did n't need more than half of that to know a dead man lay on that couch . He was on his side with his face to the back of the couch , one arm crooked under him and the forearm of the other lying almost across his eyes . Between his chest and the back of the couch there was ap213pool of blood and in that pool lay the Webley Hammerless . The side of his face was a smeared mask . I bent over him , peering at the edge of the wide open eye , the bare and gaudy arm , at the inner curve of which I could see the puffed and blackened hole in his head from which the blood oozed still . I left him like that . His wrist was warm but there was no doubt he was quite dead . I looked around for some kind of note or scribble . There was nothing but the pile of script on the desk . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its stand . There was nothing in that . Otherwise everything looked natural enough . Suicides prepare themselves in all sorts of ways , some with liquor , some with elaborate champagne dinners . Some in evening clothes , some in no clothes . People have killed themselves on the tops of walls , in ditches , in bathrooms , in the water , over the water , on the water . They have hanged themselves in barns and gassed themselves in garages . This one looked simple . I had n't heard the shot but it must have gone off when I was down by the lake watching the surfboard rider make his turn . There was plenty of noise . Why that should have mattered to Roger Wade I did n't know . Perhaps it had n't . The final impulse had coincided with the run of the speedboat . I did n't like it , but nobody cared what I liked . The torn pieces of the check were still on the floor but I left them . The torn strips of that stuff he had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not leave . I picked them out and made sure I had them all and stuffed them into my pocket . The basket was almost empty , which made it easy . No use wondering where the gun had been . There were too many places to hide it in . It could have been in a chair or in the couch , under one of the cushions . It could have been on the floor , behind the books , anywhere. sounds . I went out there . Eileen had a blue apron on and the kettle was just beginning to whistle . She turned the Hanle down and gave I went out and shut the door . I listened . From the kitchen , me a brief impersonal glance . " How do you like your tea , Mr. Marlowe ? " " Just out of the pot as it comes . " I leaned against the wall and got a cigarette out just to have some- thing to do with my fingers . I pinched and squeezed it and broke it in half and threw one half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent and picked it up . I squeezed the two halves together into a little ball . She made the tea . " I always take cream and sugar , " she said over her shoulder . " Strange , when I drink my coffee black . I learned tea drinking in England . They were using saccharin instead of sugar . When the war came they had no cream , of course . " " You lived in England ? " " I worked there . I stayed all through the Blitz . I met a man  --  but I told you about that . " " Where did you meet Roger ? " " In New York . " " Married there ? " She swung around , frowning . " No , we were not married in New York . Why ? " " Just talking while the tea draws . " She looked out of the window over the sink . She could see down to the lake from there . She leaned against the edge of the drain- board and her fingers fiddled with a folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " and I do n't know how . Perhaps he 'll have to be committed to an institution . Somehow I ca n't quitesee myself doing that . I 'd have to sign something , would n't I ? " She turned around when she asked that . " He could do it himself , " I said . " That is , he could have up to now . " The tea timer rang its bell . She turned back to the sink and poured the tea from one pot into another . Then she put the fresh pot on the tray she had already fixed up with cups . I went over andgot the tray and carried it to the table between the two davenportsin the living room . She sat down opposite me and poured two cups . I reached for mine and set it down in front of me for it to cool . Iwatched her fix hers with two lumps of sugar and the cream . She tasted it . " What did you mean by that last remark ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  committed himself to some insti- tution , you meant , did n't you ? " " I guess it was a wild pitch . Did you hide the gun I told you about ? You know , the morning after he made that play upstairs . " " Hide it ? " she repeated frowning . " No . I never do anything likep215that . I do n't believe in it . Why are you asking ? " " And you forgot your house keys today ? " " I told you I did . " " But not the garage key . Usually in this kind of house the outside keys are mastered . " " I do n't need a key for the garage , " she said sharply . " It opens by a switch . There 's a relay switch inside the front door you push up as you go out . Then another switch beside the garage operates that it . " " I see . " " You are making some rather strange remarks , " she said with acid in her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had some rather strange experiences in this house . Guns going off in the night , drunks lying out on the from , lawn and doctors coming that wo n't do anything . Lovely women wrapping their arms around me and talking as if they thought I was someone else , Mexican houseboys throwing knives . It 's a pity about that gun . But you do n't really love your husband , do you ? 1 guess I said that before too . " She stood up slowly . She was as calm as a custard , but her violet eyes did n't seem quite the same color , nor of quite the same softness . Then her mouth began to tremble . " Is  --  is something  --  wrong in there ? " she asked very slowly , and looked towards the study . I barely had time to nod before she was running . She was at the door in a flash . She threw it open and darted in . If I expected a wild scream I was fooled . I did n't hear anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out and eased into that corny routine about bad news , prepare yourself , wo n't you sit down , I 'm afraid some- thing rather serious has happened . Blah , blah , blab . And when you have worked your way through it you have n't saved anybody a thing . Often enough you have made it worse . I got up and followed her into the study . She was kneeling beside the couch with his head pulled against her breast , smearing herself with his blood . She was n't making a sound of any kind . Her eyes were shut . She was rocking back and forth on her knees as far as she could , holding him tight.  | I went back out and found a telephone and a book . I called the sheriff 's substation that seemed to be nearest . Did n't matter , they 'd relay it by radio in any case . Then I went out to the kitchen and turned the water on and fed the strips of yellow paper from my pocket down the electric garbage grinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it . In a matter of seconds the stuff was gone . I shut off the water and switched off the motor . I went back to the living room and opened the front door and stepped outside . There must have been a deputy cruising close by because he was there in about six minutes . When I took him into the study she was still kneeling by the couch . He went over to her at once . " I 'm sorry , ma'am . I understand how you must feel , but you should n't be touching anything . " She turned her head , then scrambled to her feet . " It 's my husband . He 's been shot . " He took his cap off and put it on the desk . He reached for the telephone . " His name is Roger Wade , " she said in a high brittle voice . " He 's the famous novelist . " " I know who he is , ma'am , " the deputy said , and dialed . She looked down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and change this ? " " Sure . " He nodded to her and spoke into the phone , then hung up and turned . " You say he 's been shot . That mean somebody else shot him ? " " I think this man murdered him , " she said without looking at me , and went quickly out of the room . The deputy looked at me . He got a notebook out . He wrote something in it . " I better have your name , " he said casually , " and address . You the one called in ? " " Yes . " I told him my name and address . " Just take it easy until Lieutenant Ohls gets here . " " Bernie Ohls ? " " Yeah . You know him ? " " Sure . I 've known him a long time . He used to work out of the D.A . ' s office . " " Not lately , " the deputy said . " He 's Assistant Chief of Homicide ,  |p217working  out of the L.A. Sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Marlowe ? " " Mrs. Wade did n't make it sound that way . " He shrugged and half smiled . " Just take it easy , Mr. Marlowe . Not carrying a gun , are you ? " " Not today . " " I better make sure . " He did . He looked towards the couch then . " In spots like this you ca n't expect the wife to make much sense . We better wait outside . " OHLS WAS A MEDIUM-SIZED THICK MAN with short-cropped faded blond hair and faded blue eyes . He had stiff white eyebrows and in the days before he stopped wearing a hat you were always a little sur- prised when he took it off  --  there was so much more head than you expected . He was a hard tough cop with a grim outlook on life but a very decent guy underneath . He ought to have made captain years ago . He had passed the examination among the top three half a dozen times . But the Sheriff did n't like him and he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of his jaw . Flashlights had been going off in the study for a long time . Men had gone in and out . I had just sat in the living room with a plain-clothes dick and waited . Ohls sat down on the edge of a chair and dangled his hands . He was chewing on an unlit cigarette . He looked at Inc broodingly . " Remember the old days when they had a gatehouse and a private police force in Idle Valley ? " I nodded . " And gambling also . " " Sure . You ca n't stop it . This whole valley is still private prop- erty . Like Arrowhead used to be , and Emerald Bay . Long time since I was on a case with no reporters jumping around . Somebody must have whispered in Sheriff Petersen 's ear . They kept it off the teletype . " " Real considerate of them , " I said . " How is Mrs. Wade ? " " Too relaxed . She must of grabbed some pills . There 's a dozen kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your friends do n't have a lot of luck lately , do they ? They get dead . " I did n't have anything to say to that . " Gunshot suicides always interest me , " Ohls said loosely . " So easy to fake . The wife says you killed him . Why would she say that ? " " She does n't mean it literally . " " Nobody else was here . She says you knew where the gun was , knew he was getting drunk , knew he had fired off the gun the other night when she had to fight with him to get the gun away from him . You were there that night too . Do n't seem to help much , do you ? " " I searched his desk this afternoon . No gun . I 'd told her where it was and to put it away . She says now she did n't believe in that sort of thing . " " Just when would ' now ' be ? " Ohls asked gruffly . " After she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You searched the desk . Why ? " Ohls lifted his hands and put them on his knees . He was looking at me indifferently , as if he did n't care what I said . " He was getting drunk . I thought it just as well to have the gun somewhere else . But he did n't try to kill himself the other night . It was just show-off . " Ohls nodded . He took the chewed cigarette out of his mouth , dropped it into a tray , and put a fresh one in place of it . " I quit smoking , " he said . " Got me coughing too much . But the goddam things still ride me . Ca n't feel right without one in my mouth . You supposed to watch the guy when he 's alone ? " " Certainly not . He asked me to come out and have lunch . We talked and he was kind of depressed about his writing not going well . Ile decided to hit the bottle . Think I should have taken it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm just trying to get a picture . How much drinking did you do ? "  | " Beer . " " It 's your tough luck you were here , Marlowe . What was the check for ? The one he wrote and signed and tore up ? " " They all wanted me to come and live here and keep him in line . All means himself , his wife , and his publisher , a man named Howard Spencer . He 's in New York , I guess . You can check with him . I turned it down . Afterwards she came to me and said her husband was off on a toot and she was worried and would 1 find him and bring him home . I did that . Next thing I knew I was carrying him in off his front lawn and putting him to bed . I did n't want any part of it , Bernie . It just kind of grew up around me . " " Nothing to do with the Lennox case , huh ? " " Aw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lennox case . " " How true , " Ohls said dryly . He squeezed his kneecaps . A man came in at the front door and spoke to the other dick , then came across to Ohls . " There 's a Dr. Loring outside , Lieutenant . Says he was called . He 's the lady 's doctor . " " Let him in . " The dick went back and Dr. Loring came in with his neat black bag . He was cool and elegant in a tropical worsted suit . Ile went past me without looking at me . " Upstairs ? " he asked Ohls . " Yeah  --  in her room . " Ohls stood up . " What you give her that demerol for , Doc ? " Dr. Loring frowned at him . " I prescribe for my patient as 1 think proper , " he said coldly . " I am not required to explain why . Who says I gave Mrs. Wade demerol ? " " I do . The bottle 's up there with your name on it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't know it , Doc , but we have a pretty complete exhibit of the little pills downtown . Bluejays , redbirds lot . That 's the stuff Goering lived on , I heard somewhere . Took eighteen a day when they caught him . Took the army doctors three months to cut him down . " " I do n't know what those words mean , " Dr. Loring said frigidly . " You do n't ? Pity . Bluejays are sodium amytal . Redbirds are seconal . Yellow jackets are nembutal . Goofballs are one of thep220barbiturates laced with benzedrine . Demerol is a synthetic narcotic that is very habit forming . You just hand ' em out , huh ? Is the lady suffering from something serious ? " " A drunken husband can be a very serious complaint indeed for a sensitive woman , " Dr. Loring said . " You did n't get around to him , huh ? Pity . Mrs. Wade 's upstairs , Doc . Thanks for the time . " " You are impertinent , sir . I shall report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohls said . " But before you report me , do some- thing else . Keep the lady clear in her head . I 've got questions to ask . " " I shall do exactly what I think best for her condition . Do you know who I am , by any chance ? And just to make matters clear , Mr. Wade was not my patient . I do n't treat alcoholics . " " Just their wives , huh ? " Ohls snarled at him . " Yeah , I know who you are , Doc . I 'm bleeding internally . My name is Ohls . Lieutenant Ohls . " Dr. Loring went on up the stairs . Ohls sat down again and grinned at me . " You got to be diplomatic with this kind of people , " he said . A man came out of the study and came up to Ohls . A thin serious- looking man with glasses and a brainy forehead . " Lieutenant . " " Shoot . " " The wound is contact , typically suicidal , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exophthalmic from the same cause . I do n't think there will be any prints on the outside of the gun . It 's been bled on too freely . " " Could it be homicide if the guy was asleep or passed out drunk ? " Ohls asked him . " Of course , but there 's no indication of it . The gun 's a Webley Hammerless . Typically , this gun takes a very stiff pull to cock it , but a very light pull to discharge it . The recoil explains the position of the gun . I see nothing against suicide so far . I expect a high figure on alcoholic concentration . If it 's high enough  --  " the man stopped and shrugged meaningly  --  " I might be inclined to doubt suicide . " " Thanks . Somebody call the coroner ? "  | The man nodded and went away . Ohls yawned and looked at his watch . Then he looked at me . " You want to blow ? " " Sure , if you 'll let me . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you later on . Stick around where you can be found , that 's all . You were a dick once , you know how they go . Some you got to work fast before the evidence gets away from you . This one is just the opposite . If it was a homicide , who wanted him dead ? His wife ? She was n't here . You ? Fine , you had the house to yourself and knew where the gun was . A perfect setup . Everything but a motive , and we might perhaps give some weight to your experience . I figure if you wanted to kill a guy , you could maybe do it a little less obviously . " " Thanks , Bernie . I could at that . " " The help was n't here . They 're out . So it must have been some- body that just happened to drop by . That somebody had to know where Wade 's gun was , had to find him drunk enough to be asleep or passed out , and had to pull the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shot , and had to get away before you came back into the house . That I do n't buy on any knowledge I have now . The only person who had the means and opportunity was the one guy who would n't have used them  --  for the simple reason he was the one guy who had them . " I stood up to go . " Okay , Bernie . I 'll be home all evening . " " There 's just one thing , " Ohls said musingly . " This man Wade was a big time writer . Lots of dough , lots of reputation . I do n't go for his sort of crap myself . You might find nicer people than his characters in a whorehouse . That 's a matter of taste and none of in one of the best places to live in in the county . I le had a beautifulwife , lots of friends , and no troubles at all . What I want to know is my business as a cop . With all this money he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to pull a trigger ? Sure as hell something did . If you know , you better get ready to lay it on the line . See you . " I went to the door . The man on the door looked back at Ohls , got the sign , and let me out . I got into my car and had to edge over on the lawn to get around the various official cars that jammed the driveway . At the gate another deputy looked me over but didn'tp222say anything . I slipped my dark glasses on and drove back towards the main highway . The road was empty and peaceful . The after- noon sun beat down on the manicured lawns and the large roomy expensive houses behind them . A man not unknown to the world had died in a pool of blood in a house in Idle Valley , but the lazy quiet had not been disturbed . So far as the newspapers were concerned it might have happened in Tibet . At a turn of the road the walls of two estates came down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked there . A deputy got out and held up his hand . I stopped . He came to the window . " May I see your driver 's license , please ? " I took out my wallet and handed it to him open . " Just the license , please . I 'm not allowed to touch your wallet . " I took it out and gave it to him . " What 's the trouble ? " He glanced into my car and handed me back my license . " No trouble , " he said . " Just a routine check . Sorry to have troubled you . " He waved me on and went back to the parked car . Just like a cop . They never tell you why they are doing anything . That way you do n't find out they do n't know themselves . I drove home , bought myself a couple of cold drinks , went out to dinner , came back , opened the windows and my shirt and waited for something to happen . I waited a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told me to come in and not stop on the way to pick any flowers . THEY HAD CANDY IN A HARD CHAIR against the wall of the Sheriff 's anteroom . He hated me with his eyes as I went by him into the big square room where Sheriff Petersen held court in the middle of ap223collection of testimonials from a grateful public to his twenty years of faithful public service . The walls were loaded with photographs of horses and Sheriff Petersen made a personal appearance in every photograph . The corners of his carved desk were horses ' heads . His inkwell was a mounted polished horse 's hoof and his pens were planted in the mate to it filled with white sand . A gold plate on each of these said something or other about a date . In the middle of a spotless desk blotter lay a bag of Bull Durham and a pack of with one hand on horseback and often did , especially when leading brown cigarette papers . Petersen rolled his own . He could roll one a parade on a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silverwork . On horseback he wore a Hat-crowned Mexican sombrero . He rode beautifully and his horse always knew exactly when to be quiet , when to act up so that the Sheriff with his calm inscrutable smile could bring the horse back under control with one hand . The Sheriff had a good act . He had a handsome hawklike profile , getting a little saggy under the chin by now , but he middle fifties and his father , a Dane , had left him a lot of money . a lot of hard work into having his picture taken . He was in his The Sheriff did n't look like a Dane , because his hair was dark and knew how to hold his head so it would n't show too much . He put his skin was brown and he had the impassive poise of a cigar store Indian and about the same kind of brains . But nobody had ever called him a crook . There had been crooks in his department and of the crookedness rubbed off on Sheriff Petersen . He just went right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at they had fooled him as well as they had fooled the public , but none the head of parades , and questioning suspects in front of cameras . That 's what the captions said . As a matter of fact he never ques- tioned anybody . He would n't have known how . He just sat at his desk looking sternly at the suspect , showing his profile to the camera . The flash bulbs would go off , the camera men would thank the Sheriff deferentially , and the suspect would be removed not having opened his mouth , and the Sheriff would go home to his ranch in the San Fernando Valley . There he could always be reached . If you could n't reach him in person , you could talk to one of his horses . Once in a while , come election time , some misguided politician would try to get Sheriff Petersen 's job , and would be apt to call himp224things like The Guy With The Built-In Profile or The Ham That Smokes Itself , but it did n't get him anywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living testimonial to the fact thatyou can hold an important public office forever in our country with no qualifications for it but a clean nose , a photogenic face , and a close mouth . If on top of that you look good on a horse , you are unbeatable . As Ohls and I went in , Sheriff Petersen was standing behind his desk and the camera boys were filing out by another door . The Sheriff had his white stetson on . He was rolling a cigarette . He was all set to go home . He looked at me sternly . " Who 's this ? " he asked in a rich baritone voice . " Name 's Philip Marlowe , Chief , " Ohls said . " Only person in the house when Wade shot himself . You want a picture ? " The Sheriff studied me . " I do n't think so , " he said , and turned to a big tired-looking man with iron-gray hair . " If you need me , I 'll be at the ranch , Captain Hernandez . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a kitchen match . He lit it on his thumbnail . No lighters for Sheriff Petersen . He was strictly a roll- **37;7617;TOOLONG type . He said goodnight and went out . A deadpan character with hard black eyes went with him , his personal bodyguard . The door closed . When he was gone Captain Hernandez moved to the desk and sat in the Sheriff 's enormous chair and a stenotype operator in the corner moved his stand out from the wall to get elbow room . Ohls sat at the end of the desk and looked amused . " All right , Marlowe , " Hernandez said briskly . " Let 's have it . " " How come I do n't get my photo taken ? " " You heard what the Sheriff said . " " Yeah , but why ? " I whined . Ohls laughed . " You know damn well why . " " You mean on account of I 'm tall , dark , and handsome and some- body might look at me ? " " Cut it , " Hernandez said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ment . Start from the beginning . " I gave it to them from the beginning : my interview with Howard Spencer , my meeting with Eileen Wade , her asking me to find Roger ,  |p225my  finding him , her asking me to the house , what Wade asked me to do and how I found him passed out near the hibiscus bushes and the rest of it . The stenotype operator took it down . Nobody inter- rupted me . All of it was true . The truth and nothing but the truth . But not quite all the truth . What I left out was my business . " Nice , " Hernandez said at the end . " But not quite complete . " This was a cool competent dangerous guy , this Hernandez . Some- body in the Sheriff 's office had to be . " The night Wade shot off thegun in his bedroom you went into Mrs. Wade 's room and were in there for some time with the door shut . What were you doing in there ? " " She called me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why shut the door ? " " Wade was half asleep and I did n't want to make any noise . Also the houseboy was hanging around with his ear out . Also she asked me to shut the door . I did n't realize it was going to be important . " " How long were you in there ? " " I do n't know . Three minutes maybe . " " I suggest you were in there a couple of hours , " Hernandez said coldly . " Do I make myself clear ? " I looked at Ohls . Ohls did n't look at anything . He was chewing on an unlighted cigarette as usual . " You are misinformed , Captain . " " We 'll see . After you left the room you went downstairs to the study and spent the night on the couch . Perhaps I should say the rest of the night . " " It was ten minutes to eleven when he called me at home . It was long past two o'clock when I went into the study for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night if you like . " " Get the houseboy in here , " Hernandez said . Ohls went out and came back with Candy . They put Candy in a chair . Hernandez asked him a few questions to establish who he was and so on . Then he said : " All right , Candy  --  we 'll call you that for convenience  --  after you helped Marlowe put Roger Wade to bed , what happened ? " I knew what was coming more or less . Candy told his story in a quiet savage voice with very little accent . It seemed as if he couldturn that on and off at will . His story was that he had hung around downstairs in case he was wanted again , part of the time in the kitchen where he got himself some food , part of the time in the living room . While in the living room sitting in a chair near the front door he had seen Eileen Wade standing in the door of her room and he had seen her take her clothes off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under it and he had seen me go into her room and I shut the door and stayed in there a long time , a couple of hours he thought . He had gone up the stairs and listened . He had heard the bedsprings making sounds . He had heard whispering . He made his meaning very obvious . When he had finished he gave me a corrosive look and his mouth was twisted tight with hatred . " Take him out , " Hernandez said . " Just a minute , " I said . " I want to question him . " " I ask the questions here , " Hernandez said sharply . " You do n't know how , Captain . You were n't there . He 's lying and he knows it and I know it . " Hernandez leaned back and picked up one of the Sheriff 's pens . He bent the handle of the pen . It was long and pointed and made of stiffened horsehair . When he let go of the point it sprang back . " Shoot , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where were you when you saw Mrs. Wade take her clothes off ? " " I was sitting down in a chair near the front door , " he said in a surly tone . " Between the front door and the two facing davenports ? " " What I said . " " Where was Mrs. Wade ? " " Just inside the door of her room . The door was open . " " What light was there in the living room ? " " One lamp . Tall lamp what they call a bridge lamp . " " What light was on the balcony ? " " No light . Light in her bedroom . " " What kind of light in her bedroom ? " " Not much light . Night table lamp , maybe . " " Not a ceiling light ? " " No . " " After she took her clothes off  --  standing just inside the door of her room , you said  --  she put on a robe . What kind of robe ? "  | " Blue robe . Long thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sash . " " So if you had n't actually seen her take her clothes off you would n't know what she had on under the robe ? " He shrugged . He looked vaguely worried . " Si . That 's right . But I see her take her clothes off . " " You 're a liar . There is n't any place in the living room from which you could see her take her clothes off right bang in her door- way , much less inside her room . She would have to come out to the edge of the balcony . If she had done that she would have seen you . " He just glared at me . I turned to Ohls . " You 've seen the house . Captain Hernandez has n't  --  or has he ? " Ohls shook his head slightly . Hernandez frowned and said nothing . " There is no spot in that living room , Captain Hernandez , from which he could see even the top of Mrs. Wade 's head  --  even if he was standing up  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller than he is and I could only see the top foot of an open door was as far back as her own doorway or inside it . I 'm four inches when I was standing just inside the front door of the house . She would have to come out to the edge of the balcony for hint to see what he says he saw . Why would she do that ? Why would she undress in her doorway even ? There 's no sense to it . " Hernandez just looked at me . Then he looked at Candy . " How about the time element ? " he asked softly , speaking to me . " That 's his word against mine . I 'm talking about what can be proved . " Candy just stared at him sulkily . " Take him out , " Hernandez said . Hernandez spit Spanish at Candy too fast for me to understand . Ohls jerked a thumb and opened the door . Candy went out . Hernandez brought out a box of cigarettes , stuck one on his lip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the room . Hernandez said calmly : " I just told him that if there was an inquest and he told that story on the stand , he 'd find himself doing a one-to-three up in Q for perjury . Did n't seem to impress him much . It 's obvious what 's eating him . An old-fashioned case of hot pants . If he 'd been around and we had any reason to suspect murder , he 'd make a pretty good pigeon  --   | except that he would have used a knife . I got the impression earlier that he felt pretty bad about Wade 's death . Any questions you want to ask , Ohls ? " Ohis shook his head . Hernandez looked at me and said : " Come back in the morning and sign your statement . We 'll have it typed out by then . We ought to have a P.M. report by ten o'clock , pre- liminary anyway . Anything you do n't like about this setup , Mar- lowe ? " " Would you mind rephrasing the question ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do like about it . " " Okay , " he said wearily . " Take off . I 'm going home . " I stood up . " Of course I never did believe that stuff Candy pulled on us , " he said . " Just used it for a corkscrew . No hard feelings , I hope . " " No feelings at all , Captain . No feelings at all . " They watched me go out and did n't say goodnight . I walked down the long corridor to the Hill Street entrance and got into my car and drove home . No feelings at all was exactly right . I was as hollow and empty as the spaces between the stars . When I got home I mixed a stiff one and stood by the open window in the living room and sipped it and listened to the groundswell of the traffic on Laurel Canyon Boule- vard and looked at the glare of the big angry city hanging over the shoulder of the hills through which the boulevard had been cut . Far off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never for very long completely silent . Twenty-four hours a day somebody is running , somebody else is trying to catch him . Out there in the night of a thousand crimes people were dying , being maimed , cut by flying glass , crushed against steering wheels or under heavy tires . People were being beaten , robbed , strangled , raped , and murdered . People were hungry , sick , bored , desperate with loneliness or remorse or fear , angry , cruel , feverish , shaken by sobs . A city no worse than others , a city rich and vigorous and full of pride , a city lost and beaten and full of emptiness . It all depends on where you sit and what your own private score is . I did n't have one . I did n't care . I finished the drink and went to bed.  | THE INQUEST WAS A FLOP . The coroner sailed into it before the medical evidence was complete , for fear the publicity would die on him . He need n't have worried . The death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not news for long , and that summer there was too much to compete . A king abdicated and another was assassinated . In one week three large passenger planes crashed . The head man of a big wire service was shot to pieces in Chicago in his own automobile . Twenty-four convicts were burned to death in a prison fire . The Coroner of Los Angeles County was out of luck . He was missing the good things in life . As I left the stand I saw Candy . He had a bright malicious grin on his face  --  I had no idea why  --  and as usual he was dressed just a little too well , in a cocoa brown gabardine suit with a white nylon shirt and a midnight blue bow tie . On the witness stand he was quiet and made a good impression . Yes , the boss had been pretty drunk lately a lot of times . Yes , he had helped put him to bed the night the gun went off upstairs . Yes , the boss had demanded whiskey before he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had refused to get it . No , he did n't know anything about Mr. Wade 's literary work , but he knew the boss had been discouraged . He kept throwing it away and then getting it out of the wastebasket again . No , he had never heard Mr. Wade quarreling with anyone . And so on . The coroner milked him but it was thin stuff . Somebody had done a good coach- ing job on Candy . Eileen Wade wore black and white . She was pale and spoke in a low clear voice which even the amplifier could not spoil . The her as if he had trouble keeping the sobs out of his voice . When she left the stand he stood up and bowed and site gave him a faint coroner handled her with two pairs of velvet gloves . He talked to She almost passed me without a glance on the way out , then at the last moment turned her head a couple of inches and nodded very slightly , as if I was somebody she must have met somewhere a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . Outside on the steps when it was all over I ran into Ohls . He was watching the traffic down below , or pretending to . " Nice job , " he said without turning his head . " Congratulations . " " You did all right on Candy . " " Not me , kid . The D.A . decided the sexy stuff was irrelevant . " " What sexy stuff was that ? " He looked at me then . " Ha , ha , ha , " he said . " And I do n't mean you . " Then his expression got remote . " I been looking at them for too many years . It wearies a man . This one came out of the special bottle . Old private stock . Strictly for the carriage trade . So long , sucker . Call me when you start wearing twenty-dollar shirts . I 'll drop around and hold your coat for you . " People eddied around us going up and down the steps . We just stood there . Ohls took a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the concrete and ground it to nothing with his heel . " Wasteful , " I said . " Only a cigarette , pal . It 's not a life . After a while maybe you marry the girl , huh ? " " Shove it . " He laughed sourly . " I been talking to the right people about the wrong things , " he said acidly . " Any objection ? " " No objection , Lieutenant , " I said , and went on down the steps . He said something behind me but I kept going . I went over to a corn-beef joint on Flower . It suited my mood . A rude sign over the entrance said : " Men Only . Dogs and Women Not Admitted . " The service inside was equally polished . The waiter who tossed your food at you needed a shave and deducted his tip without being invited . The food was simple but very good and they had a brown Swedish beer which could hit as hard as a martini . When I got back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I 'm coming by your place . I 've got things to say . " He must have been at or near the Hollywood substation because he was in the office inside twenty minutes . He planted himself in the customer 's chair and crossed his legs and growled : " I was out of line . Sorry . Forget it . " " Why forget it ? Let 's open up the wound . "  | " Suits me . Under the hat , though . To some people you 're a wrong gee . I never knew you to do anything too crooked . " " What was the crack about twenty-dollar shirts ? " " Aw hell , I was just sore , " Ohls said . " I was thinking of old man Potter . Like he told a secretary to tell a lawyer to tell District Attorney Springer to tell Captain Hernandez you were a personal friend of his . " " He would n't take the trouble . " " You met him . He gave you time . " " I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but perhaps it was only envy . He sent for me to give me some advice . He 's big and he 's tough and I do n't know what else . I do n't figure he 's a crook . " " There ai n't no clean way to make a hundred million bucks , " Ohls said . " Maybe the head man thinks his hands are clean but some- where along the line guys got pushed to the wall , nice little busi- nesses got the ground cut from under them and had to sell out for nickels , decent people lost their jobs , stocks got rigged on the market , proxies got bought up like a pennyweight of old gold , and the five per centers and the big law firms got paid hundred-grand fees for beating some law the people wanted but the rich guys did n't , on account of it cut into their profits . Big money is big power and big power gets used wrong . It 's the system . Maybe it 's the best we can get , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You sound like a Red , " I said , just to needle him . " I would n't know , " he said contemptuously . " I ai n't been investi- gated yet . You liked the suicide verdict , did n't you ? " " What else could it be ? " " Nothing else , I guess . " He put his hard blunt hands on the desk and looked at the big brown freckles on the backs of them . " I 'm getting old . Keratosis , they call those brown spots . You do n't get them until you 're past fifty . I 'm an old cop and an old cop is an oldbastard . I do n't like a few things about this Wade death . " " Such as ? " I leaned back and watched the tight sun wrinkles around his eyes . " You get so you can smell a wrong setup , even when you know you ca n't do a damn thing about it . Then you just sit and talk like now . I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk . Probably just a sudden crazy impulse . "
