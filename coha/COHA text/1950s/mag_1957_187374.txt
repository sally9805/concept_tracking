" When Benson went to Europe , " thundered Republican Congressman Usher Burdick last week , " we made a mistake by buying him a return ticket . " Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson had curdled North Dakota 's Burdick by announcing that federal price supports on milk and butterfat would be cut to the legal minimum , 75% of parity , on April 1 . Current support levels : 83% for milk , 80% for butterfat . The cuts were needed , explained Benson , to shrink the " incentive for excessive production . " <P> Production had been excessive , all right . Outlays for dairy-product supports jumped 20% this year . Piled up in federal storage depots as of Dec. 1 were 12,500 tons of dried milk , 17,000 tons of butter , 89,000 tons of cheese . But politicos from dairy-farm states predictably joined Republican Burdick in bipartisan booing at Benson 's announcement . ' ' A shocking injustice ! " cried Wisconsin Democrat William Proxmire . " A mistake ! " snapped Vermont Republican George Aiken , an old Benson defender . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of Scrooge . " <P> There was no longer much doubt that harried Ezra Benson is going to run up against sharp pitchforks on Capitol Hill in the session just ahead . The Agriculture Department predicted last week that , with improved moisture conditions in prospect , 1958 's winter wheat harvest will run a glutting 28% bigger than 1957 's . But far from taking the wheat forecast as further evidence that the high price-support approach has failed ( TIME , Dec. 23 ) , Chairman Harold D. Cooley of the House Agriculture Committee declared that Benson " wo n't get to first base " with his proposal to lower the support floor under basic crops from 75% of parity to 60% . Instead , vowed North Carolinian Cooley , Democrats will push for a return to rigid 90% supports-a tried-and-true method of boosting farm surpluses .
