To most Washington newsmen , the New York Times 's Bureau Chief Arthur Krock is the " Mr. Politics " of the U.S. press . But not to Krock himself ; he has his own Mr. Politics . Every election night in the Times city room , Krock , 66 and a veteran of a mere 25 years on the Times , turns for guidance to a real oldtimer . " When will you call it , Jim ? " asks Krock in his election night ritual . Only when 76-year-old James A. ( for Andrew ) Hagerty calls it does Krock write his story naming the election winner . " I 've always followed him completely , " says Krock , " and he 's never wrong . He has an instinct that makes him the top political reporter . " <P> Reporter Hagerty 's eminence is matched by that of his son James C. ( for Campbell ) Hagerty , 43 , press secretary for President-elect Eisenhower . But no newsman who knows James Sr. fears that he will get " preferential treatment on political stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Jim was Ike 's campaign press manager , Old Jim never once pumped him . " I saw Jimmy every day but I never use Jimmy , " said Reporter Hagerty . " I got it all from Herb Brownell . After all , I 've known him for years , just as I did Roosevelt 's men . " Young Jim puts it another way : " What the hell . I ca n't tell him anything . He knows everything anyway from other sources . " <P> " What , What ? " Old Jim Hagerty 's political sources are such that he can pick up the phone and call almost any politician in the country and get an answer . But even at 76 he is no telephone reporter ; he likes to look his sources in the eye , still makes regular rounds of Tammany wigwams , political meetings , smoke-filled rooms . When he goes to press conferences he never tries to pressure a man or grind an ideological angle . He asks questions until he is sure he has the facts , ending each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " At his desk , close by the Times city desk , Hagerty writes quickly and cleanly , seldom needs to edit his copy . <P> Hagerty was born in Plattsburg , N.Y. , started reporting politics at the age of 24 on the Plattsburg Press . He became an expert on state affairs , and the New York Herald hired him away in 1910 and put him on politics . He went to the Times four years later , covered the 1920 conventions , and has never missed a convention since . During the 1932 Democratic Convention , the rival New York Herald Tribune sent a scorching wire to its convention bureau : " The Times has beaten us again on everything . Ca n't you do something ? " The Trib bureau manager did the best thing he could : he assigned a reporter to do nothing but cover Jim Hagerty . <P> Court of Appeals . Hagerty not only beat the opposition at conventions , but became famed for other beats . He was the first reporter to learn of Jimmy Walker 's resignation as mayor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1928 he said Hoover would carry New York by 100,000 votes , and Hoover did it by 103,481 . The same year , he predicted that Roosevelt would win over Alfred Ottinger for governor of New York by " nothing , " and F.D.R. squeezed in . In 1946 he called the majority by which Ives beat Lehman in the N.Y . senate race ; in 1948 he predicted the vote by which Dewey lost the state . This year he guessed that Ike would carry the nation .
