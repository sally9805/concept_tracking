Report from Rainbow Land For millions of British newspaper readers , the U.S. is " Rainbow Land , " a world of dazzling fluff and foolishness . The man who paints it that way is Britain 's favorite Manhattan columnist , a sleekly combed English reporter named Don Iddon , who writes his weekly " Don Iddon 's Diary " for the London Daily Mail ( circ. 2,293,565 ) and a string of other papers on the Continent and through the British Commonwealth . Since British newspapers generally do an indifferent job of covering the U.S. , many readers rely on Iddon 's hodgepodge of gossip , pressagentry and political hip-shooting for much of their U.S. news . Over the weeks , he leaves the impression that most Americans guide their lives by astrology , gorge themselves on thick steaks , give their daughters $10,000 debuts and are all ready to jump into aluminum pajamas and lead-foil brassieres at the first hint of atomic attack . <P> Such airy servings , neatly calculated to confirm preconceived British notions , have won Iddon the Fleet Street title of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reporter Iddon ( " let 's face it , I 'm a terrific egotist " ) has been doing his diary the way his bosses and readers seem to like it-by skimming the foam from the U.S. scene . <P> Whose America ? Last week , in England on a refresher trip , Reporter Iddon looked about him and blandly remarked : ' ' There seems to be a surprising amount of ignorance about America . People here seem to think Americans eat nothing but steak and ride in enormous cars . Of course , that 's nonsense . " Then he went to work to plug his new book , Don Iddon 's America ( Falcon Press , London ; 125 , 6d ) , a collection of his columns which have been carefully edited with the wisdom of hindsight . Some still unedited Iddon items : " The electric chair is working overtime and Sing Sing 's Death Row is jammed as detectives round up gun-happy youths hepped up with dope . " " The sleeping-pill habit is getting more widespread in Hollywood . Actors and actresses take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benzedrine in the morning to do their work . " " The simple truth about the Negro in America . . . is that he is treated as subhuman . . . Negroes live worse than the white man 's dog . " ( Explained Iddon later : " I probably meant an Englishman 's dog . After all , Britons treat their dogs very well . . . " ) <P> Such sensational jottings are the result of long practice . Don Iddon began his reporting career in London , at age 18 , with such torrid features as " The Cocktail Girl Myth " ( for the Sunday Mercury ) , later caught on at Beaverbrook 's Daily Express , which sent him to New York in 1937 . He landed on St. Patrick 's day and , say critical Fleet Streeters , " he still writes as though every day is St. Patrick 's day in New York . " In 1938 he switched to the Daily Mail , started his column five years later and thereby got what he proudly describes as " the best job in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .
