Like a general who has advanced too far , Treasury Secretary Humphrey , generalissimo of the Administration 's war on easy money , decided it was time to dig in . <P> Secretary Humphrey 's original plan for refinancing the $265 billion U.S. debt as it comes due was to put as much of it as possible in longterm , higher-paying bonds . But his last two issues at high rates so upset the market that Government bonds dropped below par . <P> Last week Humphrey temporarily abandoned his hope of floating new longer-term issues . For $4.9 billion worth of refinancing required for June , he resorted to one-year certificates . But he did not abandon his policy of higher interest . The certificates were offered at 2 5/8% , the highest short-term Treasury rate in 20 years .
