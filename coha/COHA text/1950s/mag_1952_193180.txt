Neither Planes nor Scandal <P> Sir : The last two sentences of " New Planes , " in the Feb. 4 issue , knocked the breath out of me . " Current production of planes for the Navy is so slow that it can not even make up the deficit in Korean losses , training accidents and normal wear &; tear . The situation is so bad , said Assistant Navy Secretary for Air Floberg , that the Navy actually has 1,000 planes fewer than it did 20 months ago when the Korean war began . " Bad enough , but still worse , is that an Assistant Navy Secretary for Air can make such a statement without raising a skyrocketing scandal , without a big and hearty outburst of public indignation , without a Senate investigation committee . . . FERENC BARKO Rio de Janeiro <P> The Indispensable Ally <P> Sir : Please accept my heartiest congratulations for your Feb. 4 cover article concerning C. D. Howe , an outstanding Canadian . I hope that millions of Americans will read it , and by so doing help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalent in these United States . . . ELSPETH BEIER Ballston Lake , N.Y . <P> Sir : As an Argentine , I enjoyed your cover story . Canada is a country with some striking similarities to Argentina : smaller population but same geographical position , and similar natural resources . But Canada has come of age in industries and we have not . Guess what we need is someone like Mr. Howe . JIM ROSSI-GUERRERO Socorro , New Mex . <P> Sir : Your article about Canada was exciting .

At the same time , may I put in a " well done " for Mr. Howe ? We are proud of him . My ambition has always been to move to the U.S.A. , but after this , I wonder , maybe the grass is greener here .

You admit until recently Canadians were timid about investing their own funds in Canada 's enterprises . Therefore , it was Yankee cash and nerve that showed the way and took the early gamble . Give credit where credit is due . ALLAN S. RICHARDSON Denver <P> Tribute to a Soldier <P> Sir : Your Feb. 4 issue was the only magazine noting the passing of Major General Robert H. Soule . To most Americans he was just another " brasshat , " but to the 18,000 officers and men who served under him the loss was great . " Shorty " Soule contributed more to our Korean campaign than the general public realizes . His peerless leadership at Hungnam was the difference between a successful operation and disaster . He wholeheartedly gave his talents-and he gave his life . In many different parts of the world today , you 've made 18,000 new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Brazen Blackmail Hungarian Style
