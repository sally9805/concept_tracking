A dapper Cyranosed professor moved eagerly from tea to lecture platform to seminar last week at Manhattan 's Union Theological Seminary . Students and faculty members welcomed Oscar Cullmann as one of Europe 's outstanding Protestant theologians , author of Peter , an exegetical study of the origins of the Papacy ( TIME , Dec. 7 , 1953 ) , and of a noted eschatological work , Christ and Time . His listeners found Theologian Cullmann 's English fluent , his manner affable , and his occasional comments on the U.S. apt . <P> " Hardly anyone in America seems to know the Biblical languages , " he said . " In Europe , Greek and Hebrew are compulsory at all the seminaries . Every theologian should be able to read Scripture in the original languages , of course , but every minister should as well . New meanings disclose themselves . " <P> Toward Neoliberalism . Lutheran Cullmann , 53 , is a great searcher for new meanings himself . Born in Strasbourg , he has occupied the chair of Early Church History and the New Testament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also teaches early Christianity at the Sorbonne , commuting to Paris for two days of lecturing every fortnight . Cullmann stitches busily away at his theological works on trains between Basel , Paris and Rome ( soon to be published is his book on the Christology of the New Testament , and also in progress are a French translation of the New Testament , a commentary on the Gospel of John , and innumerable lectures ) . As he watches Europe 's intellectual landscape , Commuter Cullmann sees some significant trends . Most notable : <P> French Roman Catholics and Protestants are drawing closer together in the field of Biblical study . At the Sorbonne , about half his students are Catholic . Says Cullmann : " There has been a significant increase in recent years in the amount of freedom Catholics have in working on Biblical texts . Private discussions on theological matters between Catholics and Protestants are being encouraged . " <P> In Protestant thinking , the trend is away from Karl Earth , whose postwar neutralism has lost him some of his following . There is a tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cullmann , toward neoliberalism in theology . <P> Among Cullmann 's most provocative topics is the Christian view of the state , which was the subject of his four lectures at Union last week . The attitude of Christianity toward most modern problems , says Cullmann , can only be found by deduction from the principles of the New Testament , but the Christian attitude toward the state , he holds , is explicit in the Gospel and at its very heart . <P> The End-Time . Those who see the Christian belief in the end of the world as implying an attitude of indifference to earthly values are dead wrong , according to Cullmann . But though Christianity does not deny the world , it does not affirm it . either . The complex attitude that places the Christian between the two is what Cullmann calls " chronological dualism . " This is " the conviction that , on the one hand . . . Christ the end is already fulfilled , and that nonetheless the consummation is still in the future , since the framework of the present world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
