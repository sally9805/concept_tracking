Before the Senate labor-management investigating committee , the Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Co. ' s top labor expert , Charles A. Schimmat , last week reluctantly told a small and ugly story . In 1952 , when the C.I.O. Retail , Wholesale and Department Store Union was signing up New York area supermarket employees in a successful drive for a 40-hour work week , * Schimmat cooked up a plan for keeping 16,000 clerks in 700 A. &; P. stores working on the same old 45-hour week . <P> The plan : instead of negotiating with the aggressive C.I.O. group , he would make a deal with the A.F.L. Amalgamated <P> Meat Cutters Union , which had made no move to organize clerks , offer it an exclusive contract on " sweetheart " terms . In return for the right to collect dues from the captive thousands of A. &; P. clerks , the butchers ' union signed a 22-month contract committing the employees to work 45 hours a week . A month later , in return for some minor concessions on welfare benefits , the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend the contract for 33 months longer , still at the old hours . <P> Calculating that the A. &; P. saved $2,000,000 to $12 million a year during each year the contract was in effect over what its competitors were paying their help , Committee Chairman John L. McClellan last week called Schimmat 's conduct " reprehensible . " ' Other committee Democrats , restive over being cast in the role of labor critics in McClellan investigations , vehemently agreed . Said North Carolina 's Democrat Sam J. Ervin Jr. : " Those clerks were sold down the river . " <P> <P> * The Fair Labor Standards Act 's 40-hour work week exempts retailing .
