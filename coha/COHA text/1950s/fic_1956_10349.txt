I-IALL was a lunatic pile of a building : a great , grim , resolutely ugly dust-catcher which had been designed eighty years before by the then mayor , one Clement " Nutsy " McGrath . An ebullient man of antic behavior , he was the only mayor of the city ever to be kicked to death by a camel . This had happened in Egypt ; he had paused there while on an ill-advised world tour . Wandering about Cairo , he had encountered his first camel  --  hitherto , like the roc , a creature of fable to him . This high-spiritedand slightly demented man could hardly resist teasing such an odd beast ; the response of the camel had been savagely disproportionate , and that had been the end of Nutsy . It was from this man 's unskilled and laboriously drawn plans that the present City Hall had arisen , and for generations it had been decried as the prime eyesore of the community . Despite this , the building had its defenders , and intermittent suggestions that it be razed had met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and who , with a certain rude poetic vision , saw in this inefficient , tangled warren the perfect symbol for municipal administration . It was a noisy and an active place . In its old , high-ceilinged chambers the elected and appointed officials of government slumbered , mused , or conducted the affairs of the city ; in this they were guided by the opportunities afforded them and , to a somewhatlesser degree , by the strictures of conscience . Along the endless , outmoded corridors , hard by elevator shafts and water coolers , ranged little bands of political guerillas ; having no perceptibletie with the management of the city , they were neverthelessperpetually busy with concerns of their own . Red of face , shrewd of eye , agile of tongue , they continually nodded , winked , and flashed the cabalistic signs of confederacy , all the  --  40  --  while regarding one another with a surreptitious if unremitting attention . Skeffington 's offices were on the third floor . Normally wellfilled , this morning they were jammed to the doors , for with the announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll , and the crowd was rushing to get on board .. It was a sight familiar to Skeffington ; he had seen it often before , this quick parade of the professionals to the post ; and as often as he had seen it , he had felt the same undimmed flush of joyous anticipation . Much as he loved to win , he loved the fight to win even more , and in his appraisal of his own strengths he put in first place that of the born campaigner . This morning , once within the Hall , progress had been slow : there were more well-wishers lining his path from the outer door . He had greeted them all , addressing the majority by name . At length he reached his reception room , where the process was repeated ; in addition to the individual greetings , he made a short speech , thanking all those assembled for their anticipated support in the campaign to come . Under cover of the cheers that followed this , he bowed , waved , and disappeared into his office . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Lacy , and his two principal advisers , Sam Weinberg and old John Gorman . " Gentlemen , " Skeffington said . " A grand day to start the ball rolling . As well as heads . What 's on the schedule , Torn ? " " Everything 's fairly routine this morning , Governor , " Lacy said , planting a small pile of papers upon the great mahogany desk . " These are all for your signature : the notices to all heads of departments about the collection for Tom McCabe 's widow , the Easter Proclamation , thank-you letters to the K. of C. and the Polish-American War Veterans . Then there 's the press conference , after which you 're giving the keys to the city to Fats Citronella . Then lunch with the members of the Highway Safety Committee . " Skeffington held up a hand . " One moment , " he said . " A little amplification is required : who in hell is Fats Citronella ? And why ani I giving him the keys to the city ? " " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week for an engagement at the Poli , and the theater people were anx --  41  --  ious to have him officially welcomed . Cuke Gillen set it up . " " And I agreed ? " " Yes , one day last week ; Cuke caught you on the run . Actually , " Lacy said , " it may not be bad from the standpoint of publicity . Citronella 's apparently quite well known . " " I imagine he is . It 's been my experience that most of our great nusicians are called Fats . " lacy smiled . " No , but this one seems to be the latest fad among the teen-agers . He 's what they call a bop-musician . " " Better and better , " Skeffington said . " A bop-musician . Sam , you 're a knowledgeable man . What do you know about bop-musicians ? " " It 's nut stuff , " Weinberg said , in a hoarse , uninflected voice . Ile was a small , lumpy man in his fifties , with a gray , slumping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which heavy lids blinked with a slow regularity , as if responding to some inaudible metronome . Crumpled in the huge leather chair at the far side of the office , he looked as if in the most desperate physicalcircumstances ; in point of fact , he had never known a day 's illhealth . Nominally a lawyer , his talents had for years been displayedin neither courtroom nor law office ; his place was close by Skeffington , lingering in the background , an alert , tough , unobtrusivewraith , ready to slide out of the shadows and into action upon an instant 's notice . Most of Weinberg 's associates in the Skeffington camp regarded him with a mixture of deference and active dislike ; they found not much in the make-up of this ruthlesslittle cynic to inspire camaraderie . Skeffington , for his part , liked him and considered him an aide of singular value . He respectedhis knowledge of the minutiae of ward politics , his shrewdnessat assessing trends , his ability as a tactician ; he was one of the few people to whom Skeffington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost gave his trust . " Nut stuff , " Weinberg repeated . " You know what it is , this bop ? A bunch of hopped-up coons in purple suits blowing horns at a snob of high-school nitwits . The kids wear tight pants and run : wound screaming ' Crazy ! Crazy ! ' " " Oh , to be a boy again ! " Skeffington sighed . " Sam , you 're my bridge to the wonderful world of youth . Where does this go on ? "  --  42  --  " A couple of joints up by the ball park . " " What kind of joints ? Liquor ? " " Yeh , but no dough . The only ones who buy the booze are the musicians and a few clowns who come in to get warm . The kids are all under age . They buy Cokes and hamburgers and yell at each other . I give it six months . " " And I 'm to greet the idol of these splendid young people , " Skeffington said dryly . " Charming . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord knows I 've given keys to everyone else . Acrobats , aviators , professional wrestlers ; I remember that on one occasion I even gave them to a dog . " " A water spaniel , " Weinberg said , gloomily reaching into memory , " from Hollywood . An acting dog . " Skeffington nodded . " Trixie the Spaniel . In my opinion one of the most intelligent actresses then residing on the West Coast . She was the property of an avaricious Mexican , whom she subsequentlybit ; I think the man died . All right , Tom , we 'll give the keys to Mr. Citronella . Have the photographers stay around . What time do the reporters get here ? " Lacy looked at his watch . " In about twenty minutes . " " Fine . Then we have time to get down to business . " He pushed back his chair and looked steadily at Weinberg and Gorman . " All right , " he said . " What do you think ? " Weinberg shrugged slightly . " I think just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll be a tough one . " " John ? " Gorman spoke for the first time since Skeffington had entered the office . " I do n't know , Frank , " he said . " I do n't know will it be so tough or not . They 've no one good man to beat . " he spoke softly , his voice still holding the accents of the Galway of his nativity . He was a tall , superlatively erect old man , seven years older than Skeffington ; he had come to his new country as a boy , he had made politics his life , and so conspicuous had been his talents and so assiduous his application that for nearly fifty years he had been a ward boss of unchallenged authority . In all these years this withdrawn , celibate , soft-spoken man had never once held public office , and he had rarely so much as appeared on a public platform ; but from a single dusty room in an old water -- 43-front building he had ruled his ward firmly , efficiently , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of party discipline . It was he who lot nId jobs and homes for the recently arrived , who su ed ? lift &; in t i t lie  --  o distress , who arranged for hospitalization and the ' p ) tucnt I ) I nudical bills , who gave the son of the family his start in lilitttl the subsequent necessary pushes up the ladder , who built . Tarr  --  ounds for the children of this populous district , and who , in these days when tle age dthe helpless , and the indi- gent had come to depend increasingly upon government benefi- ccttLc , saw it that the baffling complexity of preliminary paper work was solved and that funds were ulfmately secured . He had won for his efforts the devotion and obedience of most who lived within the ward , and this in turn , as it was the largest ward itt the city , had given him an extraordinary political signifi- cance . Although it was possible for a candidate to be elected to municipal office against Gorman 's wishes  --  it had , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it was not easy ; all aspiring politicians recognized his immense power , and all , at one time or another , had sued for his favor . Skeffington had paid tribute to this power when , many years before , he had declared war on the ward bosses . " They must go , every last one of them ! " he had rumbled . " Little men who hold the destinies of thousands within their cor- rupt hands , minor barons who stand between the citizen and his elected representatives , greedy filters through which every- thing must pass and be soiled in the process : I intend to get rid of them all ! " No one had doubted that he intended to do just that , for his op- position to the ward bosses was well known . This opposition , despite his frequent pronouncements , was not a moral one , for he did not object to such bossism in principle ; it was rather that he considered it to be superfluous , a quite unnecessary inter- mediary between the voters and himself . IIe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim , like that of Peter the Great when contemplating the position of the boyars , had been essentially a simple one : that of eliminating the mid- dle man . In this , with but a single exception , he had succeeded : - tile exception had been John Gorman . He had not eliminated-44  --  Gorman ; he had not even tried . Skeffington was a confident man , but confidence alone had not brought him survival ; he was also a practical man who could calculate the odds . Because he was himself of the paternalistic type of political leader , he knew well the fierce loyalties which Gorman commanded , and while he knew that Gorman , unlike himself , was a man of severe limitations , concerned only with his ward and the problems that affected that ward , he knew that in this very narrowness of concernthere lay a highly concentrated strength . Skeffington was reasonably certain that in any city-wide struggle for power he could have defeated Gorman easily ; a ward campaign , however , conducted in the very homeland of this formidable warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have amounted to political insanity . And so , because he was faced with the hard fact of Gorman 's position , because he knew that Gorman 's ambitions were in no way rival to his own , and because , too , he entertained a warm feeling for the older man ( this was an important reason , only slightly less so than the other two ) , he had not fought him , but had joined him . The two had been allies now for almost four decades ; it was an arrangement that had brought profit to them both . Skeffington said now : " It 's true they 're in a bad way for candidates . Who is their man this time ? Here they have all that shiningarmor left over from the last campaign and no knight to put in it . Charlie McGlinchy 's a dying man ; he ca n't run , and I doubt that he would if he could . Frank Collins is their only other bet and he 's going to sit this one out . " " He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricky guy , that Collins . " " He 's out , " Skeffington said with finality . " We 've reached an understanding , our Attorney General and myself . He wants to be the next Senator and I 've promised him our support . Between ourselves , I gained the impression that he 'd just as soon be our next mayor , but apparently there 's a nigger in the woodpile in the form of the gracious Mrs. Collins . That good lady is tired of being gracious on a local scale : she wants to be gracious in Washington . And so Frank will run for the Senate next year . "  --  45  --  " The man 's a lunatic , " Gorman said . " He can have all the help we 'll give him and it 'll still do him no good . Even should he get by the primaries they 'll murder him upstate . " " Yes , " Skeffington said comfortably . " They will indeed . He has n't a chance ; he 'll lose and lose badly . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances being what they are . But Mrs. Collins wants to go to Washington . It 's a vivid demonstration of what the love of a good woman can do for a man . In the meantime , however , he 's out of our race , which leaves us with our present group of opponents . Seven good men and true . " He gazed at the typed list he held in his hand . " Not a man among them ever won an election in his life , and Sam is worried about a hard campaign . I wonder why ? " " O.K. , " Weinberg said . " So they 're all dogs . Who 's arguing ? All I say is , even a dog can be tough if everybody gets in back of the saute dog . " " A consolidation of the ungodly , born of weakness , " Skeffington murmured . The possibility seemed to give him pleasure . " Is that what you think will happen , Sam ? " " It figures . What else can they do ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camaratta , Mother Garvey , even the BetterGovernment League : they 're no dopes . They do n't want to run these dogs . They know they 're dogs ; they 're only running them because they got nobody else to run . So what happens ? One morning somebody gets real smart and says , ' O.K. , let 's face it : nobody 's got nothing . Maybe we got to get together . ' So then if they got any brains they get together , they make up their minds which dog is the best dog , and they start to kick him home . And they got plenty of stuff to kick him home with . Namely , the cab-bage . " " Ah well , " said Gorman , mildly objecting , " there 's the possibility , yes , but I do n't know as it 's much more than that . " He sat regarding his colleagues with calm blue eyes ; a snowy veteran of every conceivable combination of political circumstance , he did not think highly of this last suggestion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " all this talk about I have nothing , you have nothing , he has nothing , so let 's be pals togetherand maybe we 'll grab it all . But I wonder does it work4gthat way ? I wonder does a man like Amos Force jump into the same bed with Mother Garvey ? And would Mother have him ? You do n't get a man to go up to another man who 's been kickinghim in the behind for forty years and say , Put your arms around me , I 'm your chum today . ' Many 's the time in the ward and in the city too I 've seen the boys all split up and all without a chance to win , and still you could n't get them to join hands . And that 's because no man is willing to give up his enemies unlesshe 's a saint or unless he 's sure of the payoff . " His pale old lips twitched slightly and he said , " I do n't know but what we can eliminate the saints from our discussion here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no payoff unless they won . And together or apart , the man they 'd be running against would still be Frank . Would they care to bet too much on that , d'ye think ? " " Nevertheless , " Skeffington said , " there remains the possibility . " He leaned forward and placed both hands on the desk ; the heavy handsome face changed slightly and the deep voice became less casual . Swiftly and unmistakably , Skeffington took charge . The maneuver was accomplished without abruptness ; both Weinberg and Gorman saw it as the natural consequence of deliberation , and it occurred to neither to question or resent it . " I 've been thinking about this for some weeks now , " Skeffington said , " and it seems to me that Sam is on the right track . Our trouble is that we 're operating in an economy of scarcity : we 're faced with an acute shortage of opponents . It 's always been a truism that there was nothing like having at least two strong opponents with substantial followings . It splits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we come in free . This year things seem to be a bit different . To divide the house of the foe you have to have a couple of good dividers : that 's what 's lacking at the moment . " " A great ad to put in the papers , " Weinberg said . " WANTED : two red-hot candidates to run for mayor . " " It 's a pity Roosevelt is n't still alive , " Skeffington said . " If he were , I might request emergency aid from Washington in the shape of a pair of distinguished rivals . He 'd be only too happy to supply them . More than that , he 'd supply a few hundred thousandcash just to make sure I was defeated . Franklin was like that to his old friends . But as it is , it looks as though we face- 47 -a vacuum , and I 'm inclined to agree with you , Sam , that our vacuum Wright just possibly be filled by a single candidate , backed by everybody . " l'hat could be dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous as you seem to think , but dangerous enough to warrant our taking a few precautions . " " Alt , " said Gorman softly . With one thumb he delicately massagedthe polished , almost transparent skin above one cheekbone . " You 're sold on this , then , Frank ? " he said inquiringly . " No . I 'm sold on nothing yet . Not this early in the campaign . I agree with you , John , when you say that they 've never been able to wok out a successful coalition in the past . You may even be right in thinking they ca n't do it now ; I must admit I do n't quite see Festus passing his days in perfect harmony with the elderly maidens of the Better Government League . Nevertheless it 's their best chance whether they take it or not , and I think it might be sensible to assume they 'll take it . " Gorman nodded . " They may make the try . I do n't think so , but they may . And if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , as you say , there 's the possibility , and it 's always a good idea to plug up all the holes . " " We might begin by having another look at the field , " Skeffingtonsaid , examining once more the list of names he held in his hand : CHARLES F. HENNESSEY , ENRICO NUCATOLLA , JAMES NU- ( :ENT , FRANCIS X. RYAN , J. J. FARINACCI , KEVIN MCCLUSKEY , WILLARDCHASE . At the last name he chuckled . " Hope springs eternal in the thin bosom of Willard Chase , " he said . " That 's the best definition of an optimist 1 know : the head of the Planned Parenthood Conuuittee running for mayor of this city . An Arab would have a better chance in Tel Aviv . And Charlie Hennessey ! " " lie 's soft as a grape , " Weinberg said , " and getting softer every year . You know what he wears around now ? A cap ! " Gorman said : " He 's up there in the house by the reservoir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a ton of horse meat in the Deep-Freeze . I know damn well they all eat the same meals . Still , the man 's a great talker , you ca n't take that away from hint . Mother of God , what a gas-hag ! D'ye mind his speech , Frank , at the dinner for Al Smith back in ' 27 ? "  --  48  --  " I do , " Skeffington said . " One hour and a quarter without stopping , and all of it mush . I never saw the Happy Warrior unhappier . " His eyes lit with reminiscent satisfaction , for while he had worked with and for Smith for a number of years , there had always been a conspicuous lack of warmth between the two men , and when , in the presidential election of 1928 , Smith had been defeated , Skeffington , although he had campaigned dutifully in his behalf , had shed no tears . " Charlie Hennessey , " he said again , fondly . The memory of Smith 's discomfort bred affection ; then too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now then , " he said  --  " what about the Italian delegation ; Nucatolla and Farinacci ? Nucatolla 's Camaratta'sman : what 's he got for support ? " " Only Camaratta 's longshoremen , " Weinberg said . " The other unions wo n't touch him with a ten-foot pole . On account of they hate Camaratta . " " Nucatolla 's a great lad for playing the Church , " Gorman said . " The little lickspittle is always pussyfooting around the ward after Monsignor Tancredi , whispering that what the Church needs is a few more Italians in tall hats marching at the head of the Holy Name parade . The Monsignor agrees with him but ca n't stand the sight of him , so it does the poor man no good . " " We can count him out , then , if all he 's got is Camaratta , " Skeffington said . " And while we 're at it , let 's count Camaratta out , too . For good . I 'm tired of him . He 's a double-crosser we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longshoremanvote . I 've never liked him personally , but more important , I do n't think he 's as strong as he used to be . He 's a nuisance : I say it 's high time we froze him out permanently ; I think we can do it with very little trouble . Any objections ? " The two men looked at each other , then shook their heads ; Skeffington said , " All right then : we 're agreed . Now let 's take a look at Farinacci . I must say he 's a new one on me . Apparently he 's a new one on everybody : is it true that he 's really a barber ? " " A barber for dames , " Weinberg said . " He fixes their hair in a couple of beauty shops he owns . " " J. J. Farinacci , " Skeffington said . " He has the courage of youth . I understand he 's only a boy . "  --  49  --  " Strictly a not kid . Good-looking , wavy hair , melty eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big with the old dames . " " Too had it 's an election instead of a beauty contest , " Skeffingtonsaid . " I 'm afraid J. J. is in for a disillusioning experience . Where 's the money coming from ? " " A late k here , a buck there from the old dames . But mostly it 's his own , from the beauty parlors . I told you he was a nut kid . You want to know really how much a nut he is ? He went two whole years to a chiropractor college . " " ' I he most dangerous of all opponents , " Skeffington said dryly . " An educated man . We 'll see if we ca n't manage to further his edit ( at ion in the months to come . I hope , by the way , that he has the good sense to hold on to those initials . An Italian politician named ' J. J. '  --  what native Neopolitan heart could fail to respondto that appeal ? " Gorman whispered a little chuckle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farinacci : oh , there 's elegance for you ! It 's like one of out lads that comes up with the high-class middle name of a sudden . D ' ye remember , years back , Frank , E. Claude Monahan ? " Skeffington nodded . " Eddie Monahan . A young man with a bright political future , until one day he decided to become E. Claude Monahan . He began to carry a cane and to bow from the waist . One Thursday night a delegation from the gasworks called on him at his home and found him all alone at the dinner table , wearing a tuxedo while eating corned beef and cabbage . He might just as well have been found going around the city streets with a rose in his teeth ; from that moment on he was a dead duck . He had to flee the city ; I heard later that he became a garage attendantin the Midwest and died of eating tainted fish . A humbling lesson to us all . Especially to Farinacci . And that leaves us , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three remaining candidates : Nugent , Ryan , and McCluskey . Which one do you like as a spearhead ? " The three men continued their discussion for a very few more minutes ; there was the scheduled press conference to be held , and in any case , no progress was to be made in further elimination . Nugent , Ryan , McCluskey : it was agreed that if indeed there-50were to be a coalition with one of these at its head  --  and upon this point Gorman continued politely skeptical  --  then all were equally possible candidates . None was outstanding , and all were similarly qualified for election to the city 's highest office ; that is to sa , all were Democrats , all were Irish , all were Catholics . It was not everything , but it was enough . As to their more special qualifications and comparative strengths , it was impossible to form an estimate at this time . All were relatively unknown and all shared the common disadvantage of political inexperience . Yet this inexperience was not exclusively a disadvantage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " They 've never taken any pears because they 've never been close to the pear tree . Whichever one it is  --  if it is to be one ; I grant you that , John  --  the tactics will be more or less the same ; therefore I do n't think it matters a great deal which one it is . One of these three : we can forget the others . Meanwhile , " he said , rising , " the ball has started to roll ; let 's keep on pushing it . John , you 'll see the precinct captains ? " " I will , " Gorman said . " We 'll meet tomorrow night at my place . " " Good . Tell them we 'll all get together Tuesday night . Sam , I anticipate the usual financial problems ; maybe you 'd better have preliminary conversations with our friends the contractors this week . All except Teddy Moran and Frank Ruffino ; I 'll take care of them myself . " Weinberg nodded and said nothing ; Skeffington said , " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions ? Any difficulties ? " " There 's one important thing , Frank , " Gorman said . " The housing development in the ward : did you speak to the banks about the money ? " " Yes . Two weeks ago I invited them to submit their bids for loaning the money to the city . " " And . . . ? " " And , " Skeffington said simply , " there were no takers . It appearsthat we face a conspiracy . They 're out to get us by claimingthe city is a poor risk under my administration . Not one of them wanted to loan the city a red cent , even for so laudable a purpose . An inhumane group , bankers : . . . those whose hearts51are dry as summer 's dust . ' Do you suppose Wordsworth ever had any dealings with the Consolidated Trust ? " " Now this is damn serious , Frank , " Gorman said , with some impatience . Ile liked and admired Skeffington ; he had never regrettedhis association with him ; but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ; atvey 's rage at his colleague 's affection for the poetic . The elusisereference , the high-flown quotation were all very well when applied to the great , nebulous issues of human rights and ad-n i i t , i s t t a t i ve conduct ; but the matter of the new housing developmentwas serious business : it concerned his ward . He said , " By ( ; od , Flank , we need that money . " " You 'll get it , " Skeffington said . " Do n't worry . And you 'll get i t It on ' a single source . I 'm going to see Norman Cass of the Consolidatedin the next week or so . " " If lie 's refused you once he 's not likely to change his mind , " ( ; ortnan said . " I know Cass : he 's hard as nails . " " Well , we 'll see if we ca n't soften him up , " Skeffington said c utccfortably . " You 'll get your money , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you my word . Now , if we 're all set , Tom , let 's get the gentlemen of the press in here . They 're busy men : they have to hurry back to their papers , write their stories , and get out to the saloons . We must n't keep them waiting . " Weinberg and Gorman left , and as he did , Gorman nodded his satisfaction ; faith had vanquished skepticism . The habitual distrust he had of political promises was possible only to one who had lived long with those who made them ; it did not extend to the promises of Skeffington . Ile knew that Skeffington would keep his word to him  --  although he did not know , nor did he particularly care , precisely how this was to be done  --  and this certitude was fortified by the further knowledge that it was very much in Skeffington 's interest to do so . Skeffington himself sat back in his chair and awaited , with pleastite , the resumption of the weekly pitched battle with the press . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tice lac t that in such jousts his official position gave him something of all advantage did not unduly trouble him . He did not often think of politics in chivalric terms.  --  52  --  FourADAM arrived at his uncle 's office as the press conference was concluding . The outer office was still full ; most of those present were strangers to Adam , but some he knew at least by sight , others by name . He had no great acquaintance with any of his uncle 's political associates , but because on occasion he had visited this office , because some or all of these familiars were usually on hand , and because he was his uncle 's nephew , he had come to be known to them . Adam had decided some time ago that these men fitted into two principal and rather obvious groups . There were first of all the professional politicians , the men who worked at the job of politics and produced , the men who spent their every day in watchful surveillance of the specific areas entrusted to them : the districts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , each with its own ethnic base . Adam had gathered that these were the workers , the men of widely varying capacities and influence upon whose labors within the party Skeffington ultimatelydepended . And then there were the drones . There were perhaps a dozen of these : middle-aged to elderly men , who held neither state nor municipal office , who seemed , indeed , to have no regular employmentof any kind , but who nevertheless managed to exist and exist rather well ; possibly , Adam thought , on some form of private dole supplied by his uncle . What they did for him , what they meant to him , was a mystery to Adam : their function appeared to be that of simply being around . All of them , in one way or another , paid Skeffington the doubtful flattery of imitation : some had chosen to duplicate his formal , old-fashioned style of dress ; some the tones and accents of his speech ; others his air of courtly benignity . These attempts at duplication were seldomentirely successful , but the total effect was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering a hall surrounded by his ring of imperfect mimes was not one easily forgotten . They seemed to amuse him , although Adam wondered if often they must not have exasperated him by their very persistence , their unflagging omnipresence , their relentless determination to prove that they were " with him " in every sense of the phrase . Still , he kept them around , and Adam suspected that in some strange way he depended upon them almost as much as he did upon those who toiled . Workers , drones and total strangers were on hand today ; it was the beginning of another campaign from which would come  --  or so it was profoundly hoped  --  reward of one kind or another for all . And if the reward were not perpetual , it was the best that could be expected upon this earth . It was a reward good for four years , until the next quadrennial election ; no reasonable politician could hope for more . Adam elbowed his way through the crowd , pushing , occasionallynodding in greeting , all the while making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost at the door he came upon Ditto Boland , talking impressively to a group who , to judge from their rapt attention to his words , were utter strangers to him . Adam tried to slide by , but Ditto saw and stopped him . " Ah , good morning to you , Adam , " he said . He was a man of extraordinary appearance : enormously fat , with a wide , wrestler 's neck and a tiny head . Because , more completely than any of his colleagues , he had patterned himself after Skeffington  --  in all aspects the master had been aped : the dress , the speech , the manner  --  he had come to be known as Ditto . The name , with its implication , seemed to please him ; he answered to it readily , and the name with which he had been baptized was unused and in general unknown . He held Adam firmly by the arm . " I 'd like you to meet these good people , Adam , " he said . In the hearty , important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word rang with a fruity pomposity . " They are some of the excellent people who listened to the Governor 's stirring address as of per last night at the banquet . " With his free hand he pointed dramatically at Adam and said loudly , " Adam Caulfield here is the Governor 's only nephew , gentlemen . The Governor 's only nephew and the  --  54  --  son of his only sister , since passed on to her reward . Adam is a splendid young fellow whom the Governor is very fond of . And with every good reason in the world , as I say as one who knows ! " There was a chorus of muttered acknowledgment ; Adam smiled , nodded , and tried not to look foolish . He smiled rapidly and tried to edge away , but Ditto held on . " All these good people , Adam , every blessed last one of them are ioo per cent behind the Governor . Even before the stirring address at the banquet . They have been great admirers of his grand qualities for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartfelt and wholehearted respects , as we say . I have explained to them that the Governor is naturally a very busy man with the affairs of state this morning , and so I have volunteered to pass on to him these heartfelt respects personally . Adam , t his is Mr. Casimir Kowalski , a loyal tire dealer of the West End . And this is his handsome son Jules , also in the tire game . " The handsome son coughed nervously . " Julius , " he said , and supplied a burst of immoderate laughter . " I mean , it 's all right the way you say it , but the name is really Julius , I mean . " " I stand corrected , as we say , " Ditto said . He rocked back and forth like some mountainous , balanced toy ; geniality shone forth Isom the tiny head in the form of a capsule smile . " Julius Kowalski , of course . The name slipped my mind but only for the moment . It 's a busy morning . That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was no doubt named for one of the many Polish heroes , Mr. Kowalski ? " Mr. Casimir Kowalski cleared his throat and said , " I du n no . The old lady named him for his uncle . " " A grand people , the Poles , " Ditto said , smiling at him . " A grand , grand people . They make grand citizens . I have always said that the Poles were some of our grandest citizens and always very loyal to the Governor . Every spring the Governor and I go down to the river and the Governor personally throws a beautiful wreath on the water in honor of that grand Polish hero Pilsudski . " Adam said , " If you 'll excuse me . . . " " One single minute more , Adam . I want you to meet all these good people . " Recalled to duty , Ditto hurried through the remainingintroductions . " This here is Mr. John Shanahan , also of  --  55  --  the West End . And this is Mr. Danny Walsh and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about these two gentlemen : they are related by marriage to Clam Carey of the South Side ! Of course you met and knew the famous Clam , Adam ? " " The name , " said Adam , " seems familiar , but ... " " TlTc famous officer of the law , " said Ditto , " who caught the Murphy brothers building cut-rate caskets that the bottoms would sometimes fall out of . As the body was being carried up the church steps by the bearers there was always the chance that the departed would come sliding out from beneath . I remember one time I had the honor to represent the Governor at Little Jim Callahan 's funeral when it happened . I felt the casket getting lighter by the minute and when I looked down lo and behold there was Little Jim , slipping out through the end ! He went rolling down the steps before any of us could stop him and wound up under a policeman 's horse . That was the sort of thing that would happen with a Murphy Brothers ' casket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was nobody else but Clam Carey who put them where they belonged . In durance vile , as we say . Clam , Adam , is now unfortunately deceased himself . " " He died after eatin ' a bad clam , " Danny Walsh volunteered . " He was always very fond of clams , Clam was . " " A credit to his people and to the police force as well , " Ditto said . " Yes , yes . Now this last good man you 'll have the privilege of meeting , Adam , is none other than Mr. Thomas Jefferson , who was named after one of our great Presidents of the United States , and who will gladly tell one and all between now and Election Day just how he feels about the Governor . Right , Thomas ? " Mr. Thomas Jefferson was a Negro . " I am happy to announce that I stand foursquare behind the administration of Governor Frank Skeffington ! " he said loudly . " And why ? Because he has always been a great friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better housing for them ? Governor Skeffington ! Who has given them conditions whereby they are able to live better than the beasts of the fields ? Governor Skeffington ! Who  --  " " That 's fine , Thomas , " Ditto said , slapping him on the  --  56  --  shoulder . " Save some of that fine spirit for the rallies . There you are , Adam . You heard how one of the leading spokesman for his great race feels about the Governor . The Governor can always count on the support of the grand colored folks who live amongst us . I intend to convey all their good wishes to the Governor per-sonally ! " Adam was at last able to shake hands all round and withdraw ; he wondered if the opening of every campaign called forth these specimen voters who seemed to compose a racial spectrum . He had gone perhaps three steps when Ditto caught up with him . " One second , Adam . One single second . When you see the Governor you might tell him that I 'm out here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello on this day of days . " Adam said , " You mean you have n't seen him yet ? " Ditto lifted a pudgy forefinger . " Aha , " he said darkly . " The big question is not have I seen him , Adam . The big question is this : does he know I 'm here at all ? I told Torn Lacy to inform him of that fact as soon as he arrived , but I doubt that he did . I doubt it very much . Tom 's a good enough man in his way , but on a matter of this kind not a man to be trusted . " Poor Ditto , Adam thought ; then , because he rather liked this preposterous man  --  in addition , he had once or twice used him , thinly disguised , as the model for a comic roustabout in Little Simp  --  he said soothingly : " I 'm sure it 's just an oversight . A considerable oversight , to be sure , but one perhaps forgivable in the light of the hectic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm here , Adam . Very important for all concerned , including among them Tom Lacy . The Governor 's a grand man but he has a terrible temper when things go wrong . I would n't be a bit surprised if it did n't go very hard with Tom Lacy when the Governor finds out that I 've been kept waiting at the gate , as we say . " " Well , I 'll remind him that you 're here , Ditto . And now  --  " " That 's the good lad , Adam . I will appreciate it and so will the Governor . I know the Governor from the ground up , as we ry . He does n't like to have his old friends kept waiting around . Some people will find that out to their unhappy regret . I mention jpo names . So you can tell him like a good lad , Adam , and tell him-57-too that Ditto is out here waiting on his beck and his call . Until then , I will return to my mingling with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Adam , free at last , walked over and rapped on the private office door . He was admitted by Lacy , who said , with a slight smile : " He 'll be a few moments ; a ceremonyis going on . Come in and watch . " Adam saw that Skeffington was standing in front of the big desk ; by his side was a short , suety man with great horn-rimmed glasses , a crew cut , and a sparse goatee . He was clad in sandals and a suit of electric green ; one small hand held a golden clarinet , while the other was less exotically occupied in plucking ceaselesslyat the seat of his trousers . Opposite the two men the photographershad gathered in a semicircle ; Skeffington , a large bronze key in hand , was preparing for the presentation . " Always a great pleasure to welcome a distinguished musician to our midst . Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast . I would imagine , Mr. Citronella , " he said , with the barest flick of a glance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against the usual quota of savage breasts in the pursuit of your profession ? " The fat man blinked his eyes , smiled with a cheery vacancy , and uttered a soprano giggle . " Reef ! " he said . " Reep reet ! You are strictly on the obbo-bobbo , Mister Mayor-man ! But real strictly ! " " Splendid , " said Skeffington imperturbably . Turning to the photographers he said , " I hope you 're all listening , gentlemen : this is the way our English language is being constantly enriched . And now , Mr. Citronella , I give you the key to our fair city . Let it symbolize for you the entry into both the heart of our communityand the affections of our people . I hope your stay here will be a source of mutual pleasure and profit ; I hope you will see fit to return often . " Solemnly he awarded the key while flash-bulbs popped ; Fats Citronella giggled again and gazed in admiration at the ornate and useless object in his hand . " Letnme at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thank you one and all . Mister Mayor-man , you are but definitely with it ! I mean , you make it ! " " Delighted to hear it , " Skeffington said . Easily , naturally , un -- r , 8-obtrusively , he placed a hand beneath Citronella 's elbow , and together they began to move towards the door . " I understand you have a special appeal to the youth of the country , Mr. Citronella : a veritable Pied Piper in modern dress . " Glancing at the gaudy clarinet , he said , " I implore you not to lure our young away with the magic music of your pipes . " A small , sharp-faced man who appeared to be with Citronella said suddenly , " Maybe you should give out with a few fast runs for the Mayor , Fats . A real snappy number . Maybe Pollywog Ramble ' . " " No , no , " Skeffington said . They had reached the door ; he opened it . " That 's a pleasure I must postpone due to the pressures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again and often . You and your handsome instrument are always welcome to our city . " " Reed " said Fats Citronella , and gave a final giggle . The door opened wide and he went out , followed by the photographers and the newspapermen . As the door opened , Adam heard the noise of the outer office drop off sharply ; he saw the crowd turn as a man in the direction of the partially emerging figure of Skeffington . Obviously they awaited some sign of recognition from this focal point of all their hopes ; Adam wondered just what response such a situation demanded : the waving hand , the buoyant hortatoryphrase , the lengthy address ? Apparently , at this juncture , none of these , for Skeffington simply drew back into his private office without so much as a nod of the head ; as the door closed , Adam saw Ditto frantically pushing his way across the room , eager to reach his goal before , once more , it was too late . But it was to no purpose ; the door shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle . Skeffington pointed to a chair . " Have a seat , " he said . " Rest yourself . Most people seem to need a short rest after witnessing one of our official ceremonies for the first time . How did you like Mr. Citronella ? " " IIe seemed pretty unbelievable . I do n't think I really understoodjust why he was given the keys to the city . " " A courteous gesture towards the distinguished visitor . A timehallowedcustom , " Skeffington said urbanely , " although the word distinguished now takes in somewhat more territory than it did  --  59  --  years ago . A necessary concession to the spirit of the times ; even the lit itish Government has been forced to give in to it . Their last knight over there was a jockey . Our problem is essentially the same , only instead of handing out knighthoods , we distribute keys . We used to give them to General Pershing , Lindbergh , Gertrude Edo-le ; now we give them to Fats Citronella . We 've lowered our standards . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're distributing a very poor grade of keys these days . " Adam laughed . " I see . Do they open anything at all ? " " Not a blessed thing . If they did we 'd all have to head for the hills . I 'm perfectly willing to honor our distinguished visitors ; it 's another thing entirely to trust them . " He walked slowly back across the office and settled himself down behind the massive desk ; absently he fingered an objet d'art of singularly macabre appearance : it was a small skull which seemed to have been converted into an ash tray . " A recent acquisition , " he said , in response to Adam 's inquiring glance . " A souvenir sent in by an admirer . Said to be a relic of the first Republican mayor of the city : note the tiny cranial capacity . This place is full of heart-warming legends . But speaking of things that warm the heart , what 's the mood in the camp of the enemy this morning ? I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the good news ? Amos was a vision of delight , 1 imagine ? " " I do n't know about Mr. Force ; we do n't see each other very often . But in general , I think you could say that a certain lack of enthusiasm prevailed . " " I 'll bet it did . " He chuckled , picturing to himself the ring of glum faces around the editorial conference table . " I really think they felt all along I was n't going to run . Amos should be rebuked for such groundless optimism ; a man of his years should know better . " Adam thought suddenly of Burbank ; he said , " Not everyone was unhappy , Uncle Frank . You have at least one ardent supporterdown there . " " Oh ? Who 's that ? " " A man named Burbank . He says that years ago he used to know you quite well . " - 6o  --  " Burbank ? Not Edgar Burbank ? " " Yes . He wanted me to give you his best wishes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam thought it better to omit the codicil to this message . " He did n't seem at all sure that you 'd remember him . " " I remember him very well . A dapper man , rather effeminate . A venal little wasp , but on the whole not a bad fellow . I thought he died years ago ; he seemed to be the kind of man who would ( lie years ago . You say he 's still on the paper ? " " He shares an office with me . He 's the contest editor . " " Now that sounds impressive . Is it ? " " Well , not really . " Briefly , Adam outlined the history and the present scope of Burbank 's job ; Skeffington listened quietly , his eyes lit with amusement . When Adam finished he nodded in comprehension . " Now I understand why the man 's so eager to have me win . Amos has been hard on him , and all for a small mistake made years ago . " " The libel suit ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , ( lid he ? Yes , the libel suit . I never knew just how responsible Burbank was . In those days he was quite a good political writer ; he had all the qualifications : full of innuendo and damaging hints , careless about little things like facts , not too scrupulous . When it came to the article that libeled me I supposed he had no choice in the matter ; he wrote what he was told to write . Although , " he added , " as I recall it , he seemed to be enjoying himselfat the time . But then things went wrong and Amos cast him into outer darkness ; Amos does n't accept his losses with good grace . Especially when I 'm the beneficiary . You might tell Burhankthat I thank him for his good wishes . Tell him to drop around when he gets the chance and we 'll have a drink in memory of happier days . Happier days for him , that is ; I 've never felt better myself . Do n't add that , however ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll give him the thanks and the invitation , anyway , " Adam said . " He 's sure to appreciate those ; I do n't think either comes his way very often these days . " Then , on another note , he asked  --  6i  --  curiously , " Was he right , Uncle Frank , in saying that the libel suit was really behind the paper 's attitude towards you ? " Skelington smiled slightly . " Is that what he said ? Well , I think you might say that it was undoubtedly a factor ; it did n't exactly put them in my corner . " " Yes , but was it the factor ? What Burbank seemed to be saying this morning was that in back of everything else , all the other fric lions , there was one spot that really did the hurting , and that was the loss of the money . " " I 'm not so sure that Burbank is an absolutely reliable guide in these matters , " Skeffington said dryly . " You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , if the libel suit was the big factor  --  which , by the way , it was n't  --  it lends Burbank a certain importance , since he had something to do with it . It 's been my experience that most newspapermen are n't averse to thinking of themselves as key figures . Second , while he did cover politics around here for a number of years , there 's no guarantee that he really understood very much about what he was covering . The fact that he was a newspaperman would suggest that he did n't . It 's a point of pride with most of our political journalists that they do n't know a great deal about politics ; if they did , it would interfere with what I believe they call their objective analyses . ' The finest example of an objective analyst we 've ever had was a reporter named Mulrooney who used to write a City Hall column . He was so objective that he did n't know where City Hall was . That was no handicap , however , as he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they used to call him Mattress ' Mulrooney because it was believedthat he never left his bed , either . Towards the end of his career it was rumored that some informer had smuggled in some valuable information to him : facts about the size of the city , who the officials were , how many parties we had , and what year it was . Personally I never believed it ; I think Mulrooney remained innocentuntil the end . It did n't matter . He was widely read and considered one of our leading authorities on municipal administration . I hope , incidentally , you do n't think I 'm prejudiced against the gentlemen of the Fourth Estate ? "  --  62  --  Adam smiled . " I would n't say that they were among your favorite people . " " They 're not bad fellows , " Skeffington said , " but they write . In this city they write mostly about me , and one of the great advantages to reading a story about yourself is that you 're in a pretty good position to check on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists do n't seem to be too strong on facts ; no doubt they have an occupational distrust of them . For example , take this business of the feud between Amos and myself . Burbank explains it on the basis of a lawsuit : that 's the part of it he was implicated in , that 's the part he knows most about , so naturally it has to be the explanation . And Burbank 's fellow experts , most of whom have been trailing me for years , have their own theories : religious differences , racial hatred , party quarrels , even tax abatements  --  whatever you care to name , they 've already named it . Now any numbskull who 's been around the city for any length of time knows that all these things have some connection with the problem ; they 've all added fuel to the flames . But the point is that none of our profound friends have ever chased the story hack to the beginning and found out what started the fire in the first place . Multiply this case by fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my doubts about Burbank and his colleagues as political seers . Well , " he said , gesturing casually with his cigar , " so much for that . All brought on by the mere mention of an old friend 's name . I did n't intend to bore you with a political lecture . " " I was far from bored , " Adam said . Two thoughts , seemingly unrelated , now suggested themselves to him . It was surely remarkablethat Skeffington , on what must have been among the busiest of his days , should have summoned him to the office for a leisurely , entertaining , but politically profitless talk . It was all the more remarkable because it was unprecedented ; the two of them , uncle and nephew , were not that close . Indeed , before Adam had come back to the city , he had known his uncle chiefly as a dimly remembered figure of his boyhood : a man who came to family dinners on an occasional Sunday and holiday . He remembered the big heavy man at the dinner table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while in a soft , musical rumble he told story after story at which the adults  --  even Adam 's father , who had been notably cool towards his wife 's older brother  --  had choked with laughter . Adam , sitting their , had wondered about this man of magic who could make his lather laugh out loud . After these boyhood days , Adam had been at home very little : there had been boarding school , then college , then the war ; growinginto maturity he had come to know the city only as a base to which he returned periodically for brief , interruptive periods in his normal day-by-day existence ; he had come to know his uncle not at all . He continued to hear of him , for if Skeffington 's operation was local , his reputation was not . For the most part , Adam had become rather skilled at avoiding the occasions of contention , and if he was not able to consider the assaults upon his uncle with the same equanimity as he was those upon the alien and the unknown  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however tenuouslyheld  --  he found it relatively easy to be noncommittal . In this he had been aided by his uncle 's remoteness , plus the fact that he suspected that a good deal of what was said was very probably true . It was only in recent years that the remoteness had contracted : a tragic circumstance had brought uncle and nephew closer together . During the war Adam 's parents had moved to the Middle West , and when the war was over , Adam had followed them . Then had come , with terrifying swiftness , the accident : the skiddingcrash of automobiles on a rain-soaked highway , the death of both father and mother in a blinding instant . And so Adam , stunned , alone , had come home once more , bringing his parents for the last time back to the city where he and they and their parentsin turn had been born , back to the city where he had spent so few of his years , and which he had not thought to see again . After the funeral , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was at this time that Skeffington had come forward with an offer of any assistance that he might need . It was scarcely an unprecedented gesture from an uncle to a mourning nephew , but coining as it had , it had touched Adam , and he perceived that the relationship between himself and his uncle had altered , how -- 64ever slightly . But it had stayed at that : there had been no steady burgeoning of familial warmth . The two men saw each other , but not often . Skeffington , an expert in the preservation of relationships , kept the contact with his nephew alive but not intimate . He called him at irregular and widely spaced intervals , and they would meet , usually in the city , for lunch ; in the three years following the funeral , Adam had been to his uncle 's home but once . At all their meetings , Skeffington behaved with courtesy and great charm ; he talked amusingly and with apparent frankness , and Adam found him a tremendously entertaining companion . From each of these infrequent meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both an extraordinary and a complex person , and with a curiosity to know him further . But months would pass before their next meeting ; and under the pressure of daily concerns , the conviction grew dimmer and the curiosity weaker , to be brightened and reborn only when he again encountered his uncle . And now , on two successive days , the very busiest of days , his uncle had asked him to call  --  it was this uniqueness of procedurethat had , a moment ago , given Adam the first of his two simultaneous thoughts . The second was that the subject which his uncle was now discussing was proving to be of unexpected interest ; when Skeffington had broken off in his narrative , Adam had felt a sudden impatience , a sense of having been let down unfairly . He said now , " Please go on , Uncle Frank . What was the beginning of it all ? What did start the fire ? " " A social circumstance , " Skeffington said . " Nothing but the plain fact that my mother  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his father 's house . You know that , I imagine ? " Adam shook his head , then nodded in partial correction . " I knew that Mother 's father had died when she was young , and that the family was pretty much up against it . And I knew that grandmother had gone out to work . But I did n't know it was in the Force house . " " The very house Amos lives in today : the ancestral manse . You would n't remember Amos 's father , of course . Old Caleb Force : he was a banker . Physically he was quite different from his son . Amos always had that long , stringy look , while Caleb was small , al -- 65  --  most to the point of being a dwarf . They made an odd pair walkingdown t he street together ; I remember someone once said that Amos being Caleb 's son was like getting a rat out of a mouse . " Adam smiled . " That someone sounds familiar : it might almost have been you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I believe it might at that . Anyway , the years went by and as they did Caleb kept getting littler ; in his final years the man weighed almost nothing at all . For his own good the family eventually had to put hint on a leash . You see , he was in the habit of taking a morning walk down by the river , and this got to be dangerous : gusts of wind would blow him into the water , where he 'd thrash around , screaming for help . Humanitarian strangers kept pulling him out . The family was sensible enough to realize this kind of luck could n't possibly last . Sooner or later he 'd be blown in and there 'd be no one around but people who knew him , and that would be the end of Caleb . So they got him a leash and a male nurse to walk him up and down , and everything worked out fine . It was quite a treat to go down to the river a few years ago and watch the patriarch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But before this , as I say , your grandmother had gone to work for him as a maid . Not for long , however ; she 'd been in the house for about a year when old Caleb fired her . For stealing . " Adam was shocked . Nothing in the casual , ironic semifable had prepared him for this blunt denouement . He had never seen his maternal grandmother , who had died before he was born ; he knew her only from his mother 's stories . She had been , apparently , a slight , pious , overworked woman , affectionate but anxious , a widow with more than her share of the immigrant 's burdens and disappointments , who in later years had come with uneasiness and a faint distrust to the softened existence which her son , then on the political rise , had been able to provide for her . Adam rarely thought of this grandmother whom he had never known ; when he did , he summoned to mind a dim , almost featureless picture of a good woman , touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be touched with larceny had never occurred to him , and the news that this monstrous charge had once been made stirred him to indignation.  --  66  --  " Did n't she do anything about it ? " he asked . " Even then people must have had a few rights : could n't she get some kind of redress ? " " Redress is always welcome if you can get it , " Skeffington said . " Unfortunately , in your grandmother 's case , there was a slight complication . She was guilty . " He sat back and watched his nephew 's face ; what he saw seemed to amuse him . " Comes as a surprise , does n't it ? I would n't worry about it , however ; your grandmother was n't much of a hardened criminal . What she did was common practice in those days ; you might even say it was a necessity . You have to remember the existing conditions : they were n't exactly all they might have been . Our people were immigrantsand they were poor ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchens . Their employers were naturally eager to help them ; they decided they could help them best by keeping them poor , free of the terrible temptations that torment the well-to-do . Maids and cooks were paid next to nothing ; when they went home at night to their families , they 'd sometimes take a banana or two with them . Everybody did it , everybody knew about it , and I do n't imagine anybody thought it was one of the sins that crieth to heaven for vengeance . But Caleb Force was a rich man and rich men do n't become rich by giving away bananas , so when your grandmother was apprehended by a loyal butler , leaving the house with a grapefruit and a small jar of jelly , Caleb decided to make an example of her . He did , too . He fired her himself , in front of his family and all the other servants , whom he had thoughtfully summoned for the occasion . He sent her packing , after first reminding her that in addition to being a thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had used her well . As a Christian gentleman he naturally wanted to be sure she understood the enormity of her offense . As for Amos , he 's never been able to forget that the son of the servant who committed this crime against his purse became mayor of his city and governor of his state , and in the course of doing so managed to make life just a little bit more difficult for him . Amos 's life has n't exactly been a bed of pain , but I think I can say with all modesty that it 's been considerably more painful than if I had n't been around . In any case , that 's how it all started , and that 's why your paper , even today , continues its splendid crusade for better  --  67  --  government . Which is to say , government without me . Amos has a long memory , you see . I may add , " he said impassively , " that so have I. " Adani was silent . The story of his grandmother 's humiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was somewhat shocked to find himself not thinking of his grandmother at all . Ile was thinking , instead , of Skeffington , and of the light these revelations had shed upon his activities and possible motivations . For all his easy volubility , Skeffington in past exchanges with his nephew had proved to be rather circumspect on the really personalmatters ; Adam was oddly pleased and flattered at this unexpectedconfidence today . And as for the explanation of the beginning of the feud , it was absolutely astonishing . " Reflecting ? " said Skeffington . With an air of regret , he extinguishedthe cigar in the skull ash tray . " Until tomorrow , " he said . " Well , I can hardly blame you for thinking it over . It 's a peculiar story ; not many people would believe it . On top of everything else it has the disadvantage of being true . " " I 'm afraid I was n't thinking too much about poor Grandmother , " Adam confessed . " Which is fairly heartless of me , I suppose , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help thinking that the strangest thing in the whole story is that all this trouble between you and Mr. Force should have begun with such a personal matter . I mean , Mr. Force spends forty years fighting you in public all because , really , a long time ago Grandmother took a jar of jelly from his father 's house . Would n't you say that was at least a little unusual ? " " You would indeed , " Skeffington agreed . " Unless , of course , you happened to be in politics , in which case you would n't . Or if you would , you would n't be in politics for long . Your friends the journalists are responsible for this curious myth that public men fall out over public issues ; I believe it 's called division on a matter of principle . It 's been my experience that it 's just as easy to fall out over who said what to whose wife at a bridge party as over who voted which way on a harbor improvements bill . A good deal easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentalattachment for their wives that they do n't have for their civic waterways . Now , this kind of thing is true everywhere in public  --  68  --  life  --  the friends and enemies of the dear departed F.D.R. can testify to that  --  but it 's even truer in this city and with our people ; everybody knows everybody else and everybody rememberseverything . Tbere-. are .. . w.enty. nen in that outer office right now who could n't tell you at the point of a gun where I stood on the matter of low-cost public housing , but every last one of them would know to the day just when I moved from Devaney Street to the Avenue , or what year I took the trip to Bermuda with my mother , or what I said to our beloved Cardinal when he tried to grab a city parking lot as the site for a parochial school gym-nasium . " Adam had never before been so aware of the possibilities in these conversational tag-ends thrown out so easily by his uncle ; he said , " What did you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , " if you do n't mind telling me . " He knew that there was no love lost between the two men . Skeffington waved a casual hand . " I do n't mind a bit , " he said , " but we 'd better make it another time . It 's a long story , and naturally I 'd want to do nothing but full justice to a man of His Eminence 's stature . Besides , " he said , in a tone slightly different , " it 's not the main business before the meeting . I asked you to drop around today for a special reason . I have a little proposition to put to you . " A sudden impishness had dictated the use of the word " proposition " ; like " deal , " it was a word hardly calculated to disarm . He noted with no astonishment and with some secret amusement the quick bend of surprise across his nephew 's face , as well as the barest flicker of suspicion . A grand word , he thought , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new generation who had learned in the classrooms something of the iniquity of their elders . He wondered if this intelligent , agreeable young relative , who had been listening so attentivelyto him , now suddenly imagined he was about to be offered dubious employment ? Or , very possibly , a bribe ? He chuckled inwardly , and then , because he was genuinely fond of the boy , and because he had planned this meeting with some care  --  too much care , indeed , to have risked it by this wayward desire to shock  --  he set about the task of quick reassurance. - 6g  --  Not , however , before Adam had a chance to say , with a certain wariness , " Proposition , Uncle Frank ? " For , as a matter of fact , Skeffington 's reading of his nephew 's reaction had been remarkably accurate . " Proposition , " he repeated gravely . " Just a little something I thought might be of some interest to you . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but from our talks together , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about politics . You would n't be what might be called a political man ? " Adam shook his head . " No  --  " " I think you 're wise , " Skeffington said , rather surprisingly . " I would n't think it would be too interesting to a young man today . Certainly not as a profession . Long hours , hard work , at the beck and call of every lunatic with a vote in his pocket , and in the end , unless you 're lucky , you have a splendid chance of winding up with the assassins on your back and nothing in your purse . I do n't say this is necessarily so ; I 've done fairly well , for example , but there are a number of reasons for that we need n't go into now . Anyway , it 's the exception that proves the rule . And of course when I began it was long ago , and the situation around here was a bit different . I had no education to speak of , a good many roads were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easiest way out . I ca n't complain . But today that 's all changed , and on the whole I 'd say that a young man like yourself is far better off out of it . " " I suppose he is , " Adam said , " unless , of course , he has some irresistible itch to get into it . I think I must be immune to that particular itch ; at least I ca n't remember ever having felt it . " The conversation had taken a bewildering turn ; was it possible that his uncle had brought him here merely to urge him not to go into politics ? " Still , " Skeffington said , " you 'd be surprised how politics seem to fascinate people , people who would n't for five minutes actually get into the act themselves . They like it as spectators : it 's the greatest spectator sport in the country . People begin as strangers and in a little while they know the names and numbers of all the players ; a little while more , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would n't play the game for ten thousand70dollars , but it 's great fun to sit in the stands and look on . I must say I can understand how they feel ; it is exciting to watch . " With a bluntness which rather surprised himself , Adam said , " And are you recommending that I take a seat in the stands , Uncle Frank ? " " I believe I am , " Skeffington said imperturbably . " I 'm even doing a little better than that : I 'm recommending that you take the best seat . Which is another way of saying that I 'm inviting you to drop in here at headquarters from time to time during the campaign , just to see how things are moving along . " He proceeded now to speak with a quiet , persuasive eloquence , yet with extreme care  --  he had no wish to frighten the boy off at the outset . " You understand , I hope , that when I say drop in to see , I mean just that . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to tell you the honest truth I have n't seen a smoke-filled room in years . I think they must have gone out of style . I 'm not suggesting that you get mixed up in the campaignin any sense ; I ca n't see how that could possibly benefit you . But what could benefit you is simply being an interested spectator during this campaign . And , I may say , rather an unusual spectator . The ordinary procedure is to follow the campaigns in the newspapers , on the radio , or on television ; that 's all right , but it 's a little like looking at the moon through a ten-cent telescope . Still , it 's the only kind of view most people get . What I 'm offering you is a view that most people do n't get ; what I 'm offering is a chance to see the whole shooting match from the inside . All of which brings us to an interesting point . " He looked questioningly at Adam . " Why should you want to see it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it at all ? You 've never bothered about politics before ; why bother to be even a spectator now ? " He lifted an eyebrow and said , " I imagine it 's just possible that some of these questions may have occurred to you while I was talking . " " They have , " Adam said , smiling slightly . " The trouble is that I do n't seem to know many of the answers . Except , of course , the obvious personal one , that you 're running and I 'd be interested in seeing you win . And naturally I would be . " 71Skeffington 's head dipped appreciatively . " Glad to hear it . I hoped you would be , but I could understand it if it were the other way around . We belong to different generations ; we probablyhave slightly different ideas about the proper approach to politics . Of course there 's the fact you 're my nephew , but I 've never believed that blood ties necessarily have to reach into the voting booth . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buster was around town running for every ( ) flice on the books ; no matter what he ran for , on the night before the election an ad would appear in all the papers reading , TomorrowI will vote for the opponent of Buster Mahoney . ' It was signed , ' Buster Mahoney , Jr . ' The boy had a certain sense of family feeling , you see . But anyway  --  and quite seriously  --  I do thank you for your support . " More briskly he said : " However , I think you have several reasons which are better than the personalone for sitting in on this affair . Actually , you can approach it on a number of levels . First of all , purely as entertainment : a big political campaign , if it 's run right , is one of the greatest shows on earth . I think I can promise you that this one will be run right ; I think I can also promise that you wo n't be bored . Secondly , it ought to be interesting for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to be interested in politics to be interested in the way people tick . And they 're apt to tick a little bit differently in an election ; something seems to happen to the average member of the body politic when he 's being persuaded to cast his vote for what I modestly refer to as the indispensable man . Come along and have a look ; you may get a few surprises along the way ; I know I always have , and I 've been at it a long time . Then too , I should think that the campaign might even have a certain historical interest for you : you 'd be watching something that in a few years from now will be as dead as the dodo bird . That 's the old-fashioned political campaign . Most of the boys coming along these days stick pretty much to radio and television ; it 's all nice and easy and streamlined . As for myself , I use all the radio and television I can , but I also go into the , wards and speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street corners . It can be a difficult way of doing things , but it 's exciting , it 's the way I 've always done it , and , what 's more , it 's usually paid off . I  --  72  --  find that to be of some importance . But there 's no use kidding ourselves : it 's on the way out . People ca n't be bothered doing things like that any more . . . . I suppose , " he said reflectively , " that I 'm about the last of the old-style political leaders who 's still alive and moving around . All the others are dead or in institutions , held together by adhesive tape , bits of wire and plastic tubes . When I join them , the old campaign will vanish like the Noble Red Man . There simply wo n't be anybody around who knows how to run one . And , as this may be my last campaign , it may be your last chance to get into the act before it becomes extinct . It 's quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " " It seems to be quite an opportunity when you look at it any way , " Adam said , " although , if it 's all the same to you , I 'd just as soon not look at it in the one-last-chance way . " Once or twice before his uncle had mentioned , in the same detached and curiouslyjoyous way , the decline of his contemporaries and his own approaching period of inactivity and eventual demise ; Adam was never quite sure whether these words were intended seriously or not . Nevertheless , they managed to leave him feeling slightly uncomfortable , and now he said , " You do n't mind if I say that the candidate 's appearance defies such gloomy prediction ? " Skeffington chuckled . " I do n't mind a bit . Matter of fact , it 's good to hear such comforting words . They support my own secret conviction , which is that I 'll live to be well over a hundred . As a reward for years of upright service . Still , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance people and the doctors , who do n't feel exactly the same way about it , are n't . So I like to be prepared . And in any case , all this does n't change the fact that both the old campaign and myself are at least somewhat on the wane , and that you ought to take a look while the looking 's good . Besides which , it all might help you to know a little bit more about the place you live in . " IIe shifted in his chair ; it was a movement dictated by the requirementsof physical ease almost as much as by the necessity for glancing unobserved at his watch . He was notoriously unpunctual , and he enjoyed talking to his nephew ; still , the day was wearing on , there were people to be seen and things to be done . Accord --  73  --  ingly he decided that it was now time for the final stroke , the last persuasive push which should , he thought , do the job . Unless , of course , he had gauged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , but not likely . " Now look , " he said , leaning forward , the deep voice increasing in resonance and conviction , " I 'm suggesting this simply for one reason : I think you ought to know something about this city . It 's none of my business , of course , but I ca n't help noticing that any time I talk to you about this place and what went on in the old days , and what still goes on today , you do n't exactly turn away . You may not know a great deal about your native city , but I would n't mind betting a small sum that it interests you all the same . I can understand that easily enough . I admit to being slightly prejudiced on the subject , since in a way I 've had a fair share in making the city what it is , but whatever it is , it 's one of a kind . There 's nothing like it anywhere else in the country , there never has been anything like it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in a few short years  --  there 'll never be anything like it again . A good many people will say hooray to that , but I 'm not among them . I happen to think it 's a grand city ; it 's fascinated me all my life , and I suppose it always will . " " And I can understand that , " Adam said . In these meetings with his uncle , he was always prepared to be entertained , and he was never quite prepared for the occasional shift onto the plane where irony was suddenly abandoned and where , for an instant , genuine feeling came driving into unexpected view . It happened rarely , and always , as now , took Adam by surprise ; because he was not an unduly sentimental young man  --  and because he was , in spite of his affection for his uncle , also just slightly suspicious of him  --  there arose , at such a moment , in some cool , distant questioning corner of his brain , a doubt . It was a doubt as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was , however , a small doubt and an ungenerous one . Adam balancedit against the vigor , the frankness , the appeal of his uncle 's words ; he banished it . " It is a fascinating city , " he said . " And you 're right , of course : it does interest me , the whole extraordinarysetup . It must be completely unlike any other American city ; in a way , almost a freak . "  --  74  --  " It is indeed , " Skeffington said , " but a grand freak . Mostly because of the way it grew . It changed overnight , you know . A hundred years ago the loyal sons and daughters of the first white inhabitants went to bed one lovely evening , and by the time they woke up and rubbed their eyes , their charming old city was swollen to three times its size . The savages had arrived . Not the Indians ; far worse . It was the Irish . They had arrived and they wanted in . Even worse than that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be a particularly pretty one on either side , but I doubt if anyone would deny that it was exciting and , as I say , unique . Moreover , it 's not quite over yet , though we 're in the last stages now . For some time something new has been on the horizon : namely , the Italians . But when they take over that will be an entirely different story , and I for one wo n't be around to see it . I do n't imagine , " he said thoughtfully , " that it 'll be too much fun , anyway . " The words were oddly wistful : it was the recollection of the great unnamed political comedies of the decades gone by , and it was , thought Adam , one of the stars of the show who was remembering . He said , " Still , for a story that 's supposedly in its last stages , most of the main characters seem to be on hand . The city must have been kind to its chief dramatis personae ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't they ? " " They are , " Skeffington said . " It 's a local phenomenon ; the good die young here if nowhere else . We have a substantial companyof the others still at last-legging it around the course . Amos Force , John Gorman , the Cardinal  --  I 'm not exactly sure , by the way , that His Eminence would appreciate his inclusion in a group of politicians , but I 'm inclined to believe he qualifies  --  Festus Garvey , even your humble servant  --  we all survive , if not for long . But as long as we do , why , the show goes on , and from it you can get a pretty fair idea of the how and the why of what you see around you today . Which is really why I invite you once more to have a seat and take a look during the next few months . I 'm just a little bit serious when I say that it 's a chance that may not conic again . " " I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to very much . " " Well then , " Skeffington said . He spread his hands ; it was a  --  75  --  gesture indicating that there was no more to be said . " In that case , do so by all means . ' What is there to hold you back ? After all , there 's nothing compulsory about it . We do n't take attendance and it 's not a matter of reporting every hour on the hour . It 's entirely up to you . All you have to do is drop in whenever you want to -1 ' 11 let you know whenever anything especially worthwhileis due to happen  --  just to see how things turn out as the weeks go by . I would n't think it would interfere with your busi ' less or domestic life at all . Naturally , as a reader of your comic strip , I 'd hesitate to do the former , and as an admirer of your lovely wife , I could n't do the latter . " He paused , and then said quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so dense as to be unable to figure out a certain question that may possibly  --  and understandably  --  be passing through your mind . I 'd just like to make it perfectly clear that this is an offer from me to you , not from the candidate to the voter . In other words , there are no strings attached . " It was as he said : a sincere offer ; he intended no strings . At the same time , it was strategically placed in the line of argument , and delivered with skill ; and as Skeffington had figured , it did the job . Adam made up his mind . " I was n't thinking of strings , " he protested . " And thanks again for the offer ; I think I 'll take you up on it . " Skeffington nodded . " Good enough . " That was that , then ; he was satisfied . It was what he had hoped for and what , indeed , he had expected , but one could never be sure . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you aboard . We 'll try to give you a good show ; I think you 'll enjoy it . " He shifted the conversation into more general terms ; the two men talked for a few moments more before Adam rose to go . On his way out he remembered that he had been entrusted with a mission . " Incidentally , " he said , " I have a message from your outer office . Ditto Boland asked me to tell you that he was there , ready and waiting . " " Ditto is always ready and waiting , " Skeffington said . " The difficulty is to find out what he 's ready and waiting for . Whatever it is , I 'm afraid he 'll have to wait a little longer . So that he wo n't waste his time , I 'll have Tom entrust him with a mission of state.  --  76  --  Down to the drugstore for a box of cigars . " He showed Adam to a door other than the one by which he had entered . " A better exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one avoids the eager electorate . " Adam said , " Good-by , Uncle Frank . And again , thanks . I 'll be in soon . " " And often , I trust , " Skeffington said . " Or at least , as often as you wish . You wo n't wear out your welcome . Meanwhile , my very best wishes to your good lady . And will you be seeing your father-in-law soon ? " " Yes , tomorrow night . We 're having dinner with him . " " The joys of table , " Skeffington said . " He 's liable to be a bit dispirited over the news that I 'm running again . I 'll tell you what : you may have my permission to tell him that I 've had a complete physical examination and the result has been disquieting . It 's a white lie , of course , but it might serve to brighten up his evening . Good-by again . " It was not until later , after he had left the building , that Adam thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosest of alliances with her old foe . The news of it , he felt certain , would only serve to upset her ; therefore he would tell her nothing . It was the simple , the prudent , the husbandly solution ; having reached it , he returned to the paper in excellent spirits , ready once more for Burbank and for the completion of his daily labors with Little Simp . At this same moment , Skeffington , at his desk , was dictating memoranda of some confidence to Lacy ; he was thinking of the interview just completed , the cause just won . All arguments , he thought , had been advanced , save that which really mattered : the fact that in recent months he had felt the growing desire to have someone of his own family observe him in the conduct of his last campaign . It was perhaps sentimental ; it had the advantage of being the kind of sentiment that in no way imperiled his position . And it had to be the boy ; apart from him , there was no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the thought of his son , Skeffington 's lips tightened in an unpaternal grimace , and resolutelyhe put the subject from his mind. - 77- FineT- IAT night , all over the city , there were ceremonial gatherings , formal and informal , of varying sizes and tempers , which took note of Frank Skeffington 's decision to remain in public life ... . In the home of Amos Force , two men sat at table . One was the managing editor of the paper . He had come here in obedience to a summons from his employer ; he had come against his will . These compulsory visits to the Force homestead were rare , occurringperhaps twice a year ; they sprouted from the singular emergency , and the managing editor feared and hated them . It was not so much the interruption of his own scheduled pleasures that he minded . It was not even the detestable food . It was Amos Force himself . The managing editor ate with bowed head , his huge nose just inches above his plate ; it was an uncomfortable posture but it gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's table talk . Mr. Force was very tall and very old . He ate rapidly and with enjoyment ; as he ate he talked . His voice seemed to originate somewhere high in the back of his long , chalky head , and to emerge , finally , through his nostrils ; it was like the ceaseless hum of some articulate bee . To escape it , the managing editor tried desperately to concentrateupon the plate before him ; it was a discouraging alternative . Months had passed since his last visit to this house and the blessed interval had dimmed his memory ; the food , he knew , was appalling , but he had forgotten just how appalling . Now , face to face with the familiar menu once more , he remembered . There , on his plate , was the piece of codfish : it was dry , it was tasteless , it was inedible . There were the watery canned tomatoes.  --  78  --  There was the small , dull boiled potato . There was the bread but , as before , there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meal fit for the workhouse and the dining companions of Mr. Force . The managing editor was a saving man , but the extreme frugality of his employer 's table depressed him . Even I , he thought resentfully , even I eat better than this . It was his habit , wherever he ate , to calculate the approximate cost of the meal to the provider ; tonight he knew that he was being fed for about twelve cents . It was a dispiriting realization . The dessert arrived : this too was predictable . It was a pudding : a gluey gelatinous mess that was apparently indigenous to this house ; the managing editor had seen it nowhere else . . . Good , plain food , " Mr. Force was saying . He attacked the pudding voraciously . " Do you find this dessert enjoyable ? " " Very enjoyable , Mr. Force . " " You 're quite right , it is enjoyable . It is a kind of tapioca pudding , but it is both less expensive and more filling than the regulartapioca . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . ... I believe that Sidney Rogers has been committed to a mental hospital . " The sudden shift of subject within the monologue did not disconcert the managing editor ; he was a veteran of innumerable conversations with his employer . At the paper , however , it was at times possible to escape ; here , there was no retreat . And what was worse , it could go on for hours ; he wondered again if the old man were really a maniac . Still , one could not count on it . . . there were always those terrifying , brutal , unexpected returns to lucidity . He said , " Ah ? " " One of my oldest friends , " Mr. Force whined comfortably . " He tried to buy into my paper ten years ago . I refused to sell him so much as a single share . He was out to ruin me . He knew it and I knew it . Last year the boot was on the other foot . He needed money badly as the result of imprudent investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errand . He knew it and I told him so . It was shortly after that he began to lose his grip . And now apparently he has gone mad . Well well . Poor Sidney ... " He talked of world affairs . . . . " The country is run by madmen . Madmen and Midwesterners.  --  79  --  There is only one solution to our present difficulties and that is the hydrogen bomb . It should be dropped on every major city cast of the Iron Curtain tomorrow morning . The utter destruction of the enemy before he becomes the enemy : that is my philosophy . I want more editorials from that point of view . " Mr. Force talked of religion ... . " It is the crying need of our time . Our country was built upon religion . I am a deeply religious man , and I expect all my employeesto be deeply religious men . There is an enormous lot of nonsense talked about religion . Religion in its highest sense  --  religionas I have always practiced it  --  is brotherly love .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer consult doctors . Doctors are a greedy group who have but one target : the rich man . In the past I have gone to doctors and purposely concealed my identity in the hope of escapinga ruinous charge . It was no use . One and all , they can smell out the rich man . And so today I am my own doctor and I have never been in better health . Health is simply a matter of eating the proper foods properly prepared . That is something you should remember for your own protection . " " Certainly , Mr. Force , " said the managing editor , dispiritedly . He had been here for almost two hours ; he had eaten horrible food ; he had listened to the garrulities of a senile tyrant ; and he had still received no orders on the only subject of importance . Skeffington 's name had not been so much as mentioned . Perhaps it would not be at all . The worst thing was , one never knew ... . The two men moved to the library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite a treat for you , " Mr. Force said , turning on the set . The entertainment began , and it was now that Mr. Force revealedhis softer side . He was like a child , enchanted by everything ; the silence for which the managing editor had prayed was broken by little cries of delight : " Ah , see there ! Did you see that ? He fell flat on the floor on his behind ! Ah ha ha ha . . . look look look ! Oh this is a most amusing man : his name is Berle . He is dressed as a woman  --  Oh , my gracious ! I believe he will be hit-8o  --  in the face with that bag of flour ! This will be terribly funny . Watch carefully now . . . . Ah , THERE IT IS ! " After a very long time this comedy came to an end . It was succeededimmediately by a dramatic program , which offered a severely truncated version of All Quiet on the Western Front . Mr. Force sat spellbound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the old story swirled by . Before such serious endeavorhe was less vocal ; only occasionally did the managing editorhear the muttered interruptive commentary : " You see this is a story of World War I. You can tell by the uniforms . . . . Now it is beginning to become exciting ! The point seems to be that the soldier does not really want to fight at all . . . . We must watch him closely . . . . This is wonderful , truly wonderful . To see this in a theater would cost at least two dollars . And here we are seeing it absolutely free . . . . Ah , this is moving .... " As the show reached its climax Mr. Force became emotionally agitated ; when the soldier , reaching for the butterfly , was shot , he wept . When it was over he said , " That was an extremely sad picture . I was quite overcome . Men who are ashamed to show their emotions are indifferent to the fate of others . They have no brotherly love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . Ah , what is this we have here ? " The television programs continued . It was one o'clock in the morning before Mr. Force regretfully turned off the set . " The programs are shut down now , " he said irritably . " I do n't know why they stop their programs so early . They are fools and idiots with no regard for the pleasures of others . Well , good night . It has been a nice evening out for you , has n't it ? " " Very nice indeed , thank you , Mr. Force . " That was that , then : the old lunatic had completely forgotten the main , indeed the only , purpose of the meeting . The night had been one of purest waste . Exhausted by the evening behind him , depressed by the thought of the long and expensive taxi ride before him , the managing editor shuffled wearily to the door ; he was almost out when Mr. Force said sharply , " Now I hope you are clear on the matter of Skeffington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up quickly , just in time to catch the glint of malicious joy receding from his employer 's eye . He  --   --  knew then that the old man had really forgotten nothing ; he had merely been playing another of his cruel and private games . Now the managing editor would have to play too . " Ali , " he said vaguely . " No mistakes . Naturally not , Mr. Force . Just to be sure , I wonder if we might go over it again ? " " Again ? " The long horsy face registered mock surprise ; it was the face of a mean horse , thought the managing editor . " Very well . If it is necessary . " The garrulity , the aimlessness of his earlier conversation now suddenly vanished ; the tender , emotionsweptAmos Force who had wept over the dying soldier in the film was nowhere in evidence . He said succinctly , " One : We will attack Skeffington every day until further notice in front-page editorials . We will begin with his repudiation by Roosevelt . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editorials . Two : No pictures of Skeffington are to be allowed in the paper for any reason whatever . Three : A detective is to be assigned to follow the movements of his son constantly . He is an imbecile ; there may be indiscretions . Four : Our investigators will instigate an inquiry into Skeffington 's income-tax returns from the beginning of his political career . You will get weekly reports from them . " This was an excessively costly business , so costly that it wrenched protest from the managing editor . " You 'll remember that this was done twice before , Mr. Force ? They were really very thorough but they could n't turn up anything . " The eyes that had so recently been filled with tears now regardedhim bleakly . " They will try again , " said Mr. Force . " Five : On Sunday morning the paper will come out in full support of Kevin McCluskey . He is to be our choice for mayor . There will be a general statement of our position . On Monday we will begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be warm , appealing . You will assign the reporters who will make it so . This is to be done thoroughly . I want immediate action . I want results . " " McCluskey , " the managing editor repeated dully . He knew nothing about him . In some desperation he said , " This general statement of our position : just what is our position , Mr. Force ? " " You are losing your mind as well as your memory , " Mr. Force  --  82  --  said . " It is a sign you are growing old . Not too old for your job , I hope . Naturally our position is one of outright opposition to everything Skeffington stands for . We will say we believe this young man McCluskey to be the best qualified of the candidates opposing Skeffington . The reasons why we believe this we will reveal as we discover them . That will be your business . You will begin by conferring with McCluskey and his associates tomorrow morning . " And here Amos Force paused to insert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the candidate of his choice . " I have talked with him , " he said , " briefly . I was not impressed . He seems very little better than the usual lot . He is like the rest : trash from trashy stock . He is unknown . He is ambitious . He may be inoffensive . I suspect he may also be incapable . But since it is impossible in this city to elect a decent sort of person to public office , we must select the best of the trash to support . Thereforewe will support McCluskey . Good night . It seems to be raining outside . " With rare solicitude , he asked , " You have no raincoat ? " " No , I brought none with me , Mr. Force . " " It is just a short walk down to the gate . Your taxi will be waiting for you there . I do not allow them to drive up to the front of the house . The drivers throw cigars on the lawn . Good night . " And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragiledefiance of the pelting rain , moved off down the sodden drive . Before he reached his taxi , he was very wet indeed . The Ninth Ward Democratic Club  --  such was the homogeneousstructure of this ward that there was no Ninth Ward RepublicanClub  --  was holding its annual Spring Dance . It had been planned months before ; that it took place on this night of specialsignificance was one of those gratifying coincidences which , arising as they do from time to time , serve to reassure the waveringpolitician of the ever-present possibility of Divine intervention . It was a conjunction , moreover , which had swelled attendancebeyond all expectation , for with Skeffington 's announcement the affair had been given another dimension . Middle-aged men , notorious nondancers , suddenly appeared at the edge of the-83dance floor , trailing bewildered wives ; heavy-footed couples , they trudged around its perimeter , and in their agonizing progress they watched , they talked , they listened . For others , it was a gayer occasion ; hundreds of younger couples danced beneath the bunt ing and the giant floodlit portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skeffington . The bar was open ; the bullet was formidable . At the end of the great hall sat the orches- tra . It was large , it was expert , it was expensive ; it played through its repertoire of dance favorites , interrupting only for the periodic insertion of the melodies of racial tribute so necessary to an occasion of this kind . Music strengthened fraternity ; in the be- nign solvent of song , traditional animosities faded . Dr. Joseph Brady sang " My Wild Irish Rose " ; Mr. Arthur Piccione sang " 0 Sole Mio " ; the applause for the latter nearly equaled that for the former . It was evidence of the growing tolerance of the Irish ; it was even greater evidence of the growing numbers of the Italians . The orchestra leader , in a burst of misplaced enthusiasm , signaled for " Chinatown , My Chinatown . " It was a well-intentioned but entirely superfluous gesture ; there was not a Chinese vote in the ward . John Gorman sat on a small chair at the end of the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atenor drank ; he sat erect , receiving the steady procession of visitorswho had been coming to him since the evening began . Hewas not interested in dancing , but he was greatly interested inthe annual Spring Dance ; he had , in fact , arranged it . He consideredit a grand and useful affair . One got people togetherdancing and singing and eating and drinking , and sometimes , drugged by good spirits and the temporary feeling of fellowship , they said things and did things and agreed to things which , undermore normal circumstances , they would have considered mad . It was politically very valuable . All one had to do was wait , sittight , and keep one 's wits ; there was nothing like a nice dance , heoften thought , for doing business . He sat and watched the circlingcouples ; he knew all by sight and most by name . The majority of them had been to him for advice or assistance at onetime or another ; he sometimes felt that before he  --  or they  --  were through , they would all have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not mind . That was his function , his role in life . He was the ward leader . Old Molly Riordan came up on him from behind . " Hello , John , " she whispered . " Hello , Molly . " " A lovely party , is n't it , John ? " " Lovely . Were you dancing , Molly ? " " Ah , who 'd dance with an old woman like me , John ? " " The men with sense , " he said , and changed the subject . " I do n't see Edward . " " Edward , " she sighed . " Ah , John , a fine lot Edward cares about his old mother these days , whether she lives or dies ! " She went into the familiar story of her martyrdom at the hands of her wastrel son ; Gorman attended politely , without interrupting and without listening . He had heard it all before and knew it all by heart ; he could do nothing . The boy was a bad lot , always away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poor Molly was a bit foolish on the subject . But it was his duty to sit and let her have her way . It was no cost to him ; if it was n't Molly , it would be somebody else . At last the tale ended ; he could tell by the familiar terminal sigh . " Ah well , perhaps it 's all for the best , " she said , without great conviction . After a moment : " It 's a lovely party . " Then , after another moment , the subject of Skeffington . " You heard about Frank , I s'pose , John ? " " I heard , Molly , " he said , without smiling . " That 's grand news now , is n't it ? He 's the best of them all , John , God love him . There 's not a night goes by I do n't say a little prayer for him . And as for those dirty little scuts that turn t heir back on him I hope they all burn in hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful lot of Eyetalians here tonight , John . " " It 's a big party , Molly , " he said noncommittally . " He 's the grandest man that ever lived , " she said fiercely . " If it was n't for him and yourself I 'd be walking around in my skin and no house to live in , for all my Edward would care . Will he be here tonight , John ? " " He will . A bit later . "  --  85  --  " Ah , that 's grand . There 's months go by I do n't see him these days . It 's not like when he lived on Devaney Street when the mother was alive . But he 's the same grand man all the same and I 'll tell him so myself tonight . " A few yards away , an old crony signaled to her ; she waved back and began to move away . " Good-by for a bit , John , " she said . " Good-by , Molly . " A vote in the pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skeffington could murder the Pope  --  or worse , he could even insult Edward  --  and she 'd still be for him . And there were hundreds like her through the ward : it was the hard , untouchable core of his support . Gorman thought of them all with affection : they were good people . He sat , alone for the moment , watching the dancers , listening to the music ; it made no more sense to him than the tribal rhythms of the Kikuyus . He did not care much for music : a little waltz now and again , or " The Walls of Limerick "  --  it was nice , but after all , of no great importance . He sat like this for perhaps forty-five seconds before being touched on the shoulder . He looked up and saw a heavy , laborer 's hand , freshly manicured , extending from a handsomely tailored sleeve ; it was the hand of Teddy Moran , the contractor . The two men exchanged the greetings of old allies ; the bright blue eye of the contractor swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as big as last year . You 'll have a food bill on your hands for sure . How much , I wonder ? " He named a figure and Gorman , with a slight smile , nodded . " Near enough . A few dollars on the sunny side . " " Who 's got the catering ? " Moran asked . Details of this kind automatically interested him . " Jack Shea ? " " I split it up this year . Jack Shea for one and then I passed some along to Eddie Macaluso . He 's a good lad and a hard worker , and he has all the Italian stuff : the pink cakes and the rainbow cookies and the likes of that . I like to keep everybody happy . " " Why not ? " said Moran . " Why not ? Listen , John : I was going to drop in on the Governor today but I figured all the clowns would be there hanging around . What time is he coming to-night ? "  --  86  --  " In about an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will you stay or come back ? " " I 'll stay ; the wife is with me . We might have a few dances . Pass the word along to the band to play a few fox trots ; I ca n't do this Spanish stuff . " He looked around the room again and said , " What 's the story on the housing development ? I heard todaythe banks wo n't come through with the money . " As a builder and contractor , Moran had more than the layman 's interest in the new project . " There 's been a bit of difficulty , " Gorman said . " I would n't worry if I were you . We 're to get the money from Cass at the Consolidated . " " I tell you what I heard , " Moran said . " I heard he turned it clown . " " Your hearing 's good , " Gorman said . " He did . But he 'll turn it up again . These big lads change their minds now and again . Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next week . " " Well , Frank 's a good talker . Does he say the money 's good ? For sure ? " " He does . " Moran nodded ; as Gorman had been earlier in the day , he was satisfied now . He trusted Skeffington ; he was his friend . Equally important  --  and looking at it more dispassionately  --  he was his strongest financial backer . Moran had been in politics long enough to imagine Skeffington 's breaking a promise ; he could not imagine his breaking one either to Gorman or himself . The ties of friendship fortified by finance were too strong . He said , " Good . Well , I 'll see him when he gets here . I suppose there 's some room where we can have a little quiet conversation . " " There is , " Gorman said . " Back of the bandstand . " Expressionlesslyhe added , " They call it the Trophy Room . It 's the very same room where the axe fell down from the wall and killed poor lumps McGuire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentally . " I make it a rule never to turn my back on an axe . And now I 'm off to do the light fantastic . Will you send up to those boys , John , and tell them for the love of God to play something that a white man can dance to ? " - 87-  " I will , Teddy . " For the next half hour , Gorman sat and received those within his ward who , deserting the dance floor for a few moments , came over to pay their respects . All asked after his health ; all inquiredfor Skcflington . One or two brought bits of insignificant information ; there was a request for a temporary job ; a young man presented his newly acquired fiancee . None of it vastly important , but all of it listened to with steady courtesy : one could never tell , after all , what might not one day come to be important . It was towards the end of this half hour that Camaratta approachedhim . Gorman had seen him come into the hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello , Camaratta , " he said politely . This was the enemy ; it was a fact , but it was not sufficient to move Gorman from the paths of normal behavior . The luxury of open hostility he regarded as being ultimately pointless . " Hullo , John , " Camaratta said . One large , dull-brown eye closed in a comradely wink . " Howsa boy ? " Like Moran , he paused to gaze in appraisal around the hall . " You got yourself a real wing-ding here tonight , pal . You got yourself a sweetheart of a grocery tab , too . " Without waiting for an answer , he named a sum almost identical to that named by Moran , but now Gorman slowly shook his head . " A bad guess , Camaratta , " he said . " You 're miles off . " One did not unnecessarily allow even token satisfaction to the enemy , and in any event , Gorman 's rule in such situations was short and simple : Tell them nothing . " Yeh ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it do n't matter , anyway . It ai n't Camaratta 's dough . What time does the big fella get here ? " " Ah , that 'd be hard to say , " Gorman said vaguely . " The man has a busy night ahead of him . " " Sure , sure . " Camaratta laughed again . " He 's a busy fella . We 're all busy fellas these days , hey ? He 's busy , you 're busy , Camaratta'sbusy . I tell you what , John : maybe sometimes we all get too busy . You know what I mean ? Maybe we could do just as good if we ai n't so busy . Even the big fella . " Ile paused but Gorman said nothing ; he was listening . Cama -- 88  --  ratta on The Necessity for Leisure was new ; for this reason he suspected it . He felt that something was up . He waited . " I tell you what , John , " Camaratta said . " Maybe he should take some time off for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I mean . So long as I 'm here , I figure maybe the both of us could chew the fat a little , hey ? " He 's ready to sell out , thought Gorman in surprise . He was not surprised by the duplicity  --  he had known Camaratta for many years  --  but by its speed . The candidates had barely had time to declare themselves ; it was a record in quick treachery , even for Camaratta . There were other possible interpretations of the clumsily circumspect phrases , but in these matters Gorman trusted absolutely in his instinct , and he had not the slightest doubt of what was happening : Camaratta was about to sell his candidate down the river . Nucatolla 's slight , swarthy , foolishly trusting body was even now on the slab , marked ready for delivery ; to himself Gorman thoughtfully said : Enrico , me bucko , out you go . Precisely what had led up to this betrayal , he did not know ; he had heard of no discontent in the Nucatolla camp . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no great strength , and the situation was ripe for the well-known Camarattadouble cross . The bay was clogged with the bodies of innocentswho had at one time or another put their faith in the laughing promises of this squat manipulator . And now it was Nucatolla 's turn . Poor Enrico , thought Gorman ; and then , because he was a practical man , he did not waste time in useless pity . Camaratta was here , he was ready to talk business , he could deliver the vote of the longshoremen . This early in the game it was an unexpected development , but one of which advantage might be taken . " If you want to talk to him , Camaratta , " he said , " there 's no one to stop you . He 'll be here and so will you . If you want to go u1 , to him to pass the time of day , that 's up to yourself . " " Sure , " Camaratta said . He laughed again . " Like you say , pal : 1 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 'll talk about : we 'll talk about the weather . " " A nice quiet topic , " Gorman said . " And how 's your man Nucatolla these days ? " - 8g-  " A sweetheart , " Camaratta said instantly . " A big vote-getter , pal . One of the biggest . And a real good boy , too . A sweetheart . " " Almost like a son to you , " Gorman suggested . Camara tta lit a cigar . " Yeh , " he said . " That 's it . Like a son , pal . So I 'll see the big fella when he gets here . So long for now . " " Good-by , Camaratta . " Gorman , for the moment at least , was left alone . He had been thinking quickly ; the more he thought , the more promising the outlook became . It was another grand coincidence . Only that morning , Skeffington had announced his decision to end , at long last , Camaratta 's political career . It was a decision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly unaware . Yet here was the man himself , marching double-time to the hangman , ; better than that , he was bringing his own rope . Gorman thought devoutly that it was all very close I to being a miracle . He knew that Skeffington , who detested Camaratta , would see him tonight with pleasure ; the situation was of the kind in which he rejoiced and in which he was at his best . There would be a few minutes of cordial conversation ; then , if all went well , Camaratta , crafty though he was , would be pointed in the direction of the gallows , and in a little while that would be the end of him . And , thought Gorman , good riddance . He was not a vindictive man , and he had no time for the cherishing of personal resentments , but he did not like Camaratta . The man had no word , no word at all . That he was about to be rewarded for his misdeeds at this time was particularly suitable ; Gorman had no special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent woman , and the family had been in the ward for years . The poor simpleton deserved to be beaten , but by the usual people and by the usual methods ( Gorman had already planned a series of frontal assaults within the ward which would have destroyed him ) ; he did not deserve the poisonedbit of the spider . And so it would all work out very well indeed : one candidate was eliminated from the race ; he would be revenged on the man who had betrayed him ; and the betrayerwould be through forever . In addition to which , he thought , they might even pick up the longshoremen 's vote in the process. 90Humming , smiling faintly , he began to beat time to the music with an old , light foot . He did not recognize the song the orches- tra was playing ; it was not at all important . It was a grand party .... In his palace , situated superbly on a hill just outside the city , the Cardinal was seated in his study , an evening paper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was not in good temper . The day had been long and tiring and the Cardinal was an old man ; too old , he reminded himself wearily , for many more days such as this had been . It had begun impossibly early that morning ; after Mass , there had been the radio announce- ment which had informed him that Skeffington was to run again . Later there had been the courtesy visit of the young Ger- man bishop . Another disaster ! The young bishop 's native cour- tesy had led him to stay for lunch , a meal which the Cardinal , by preference and custom , usually ate alone ; the visitor had talked with a solid , grinding zest of the progress of the Faith in Mil- waukee ; the Cardinal had been interested , but not for long . There had been the lengthy ride into the country to open offi- cially a new convent for the order of nuns he had recently in- vited into the diocese ; helpless before the overwhelming sub- missiveness of their gratitude , he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There had been the usual routine matters of diocesan administration . And , at four o'clock , there had been the press conference . The bumpy , richly veined surface of the Cardinal 's round facedarkened as he recalled the circumstances surrounding thiscatastrophe . Through some incredible blunder , the usual seatingarrangements for the press had not been carried out ; as theCardinal had entered the reception chamber , he had seen , withhorrified eyes , not the sturdy , humble , workaday chairs suitable for such an encounter , but an elegant , fragile semicircle of theancient pieces he had brought back from Italy twenty years before . Purchased at great cost , imported with loving care , theywere chairs for the great occasion . And now they were here  --  here , for the press ! But it had been too late to remedy the error ; the newspapermen had come barging in ; they had seated them-9 ' selves . One fat-thighed oaf had plumped down heavily and there had been an immediate sharp sound of splintering . The Cardinal had drawn in his breath in a hiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had smiled the smile of an imbecile . " Oops1 " he had said guiltily . " Why did n't you bring an axe ? " the Cardinal had said icily . The press conference had not gone well . And now there was Skeffington again . The evening paper carried a full account of his day ; there was a large picture of Skeffingtonpresenting the keys of the city to Fats Citronella . The Cardinal read and closed his eyes ; he opened them again and was finishing the story when his secretary , Monsignor Killian , entered the study . The Cardinal threw the paper in the wastebasket . " Only an illiterate can go to bed content these nights , " he grumbled . " An illiterate who is also totally deaf . The papers , the radio , the television : all the news seems to be about war or murder or Skeffington . It 's scandalous ! " The young Monsignor understood his superior ; he knew that the source of immediate irritation had nothing to do with either war or murder . " Until last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eminenza , " he said . Like the Cardinal , he had been trained in Rome ; because of this , and because of the old man 's personal fondness for him , he was permitted the familiarity of this form of address . The Cardinal groaned . " Did you indeed ? Then you 're by no means as intelligent as some rather simple people seem to believe you are . " The Monsignor smiled . Almost alone among the clergy of the diocese , he was able to discuss , even mildly to dispute , matters with the Cardinal , whom age and sickness and pain had left liable to unpredictable bursts of crankiness . However , he did not at any time push him too far : charity and affection  --  and prudence  --  precluded this . He said , " I also thought that even if he did run , he had an excellent chance of being beaten . " The Cardinal waved one swollen , arthritic hand ; the big ring on his third finger caught the light and gleamed dully . " And if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it , but if he has , what of it ? He 's had a lifetime to do his damage , and he 's done it . Four  --  g2-years more , one way or the other , wo n't make the slightest difference . I 'm not complaining because he may and probably will govern us for another term ; I 'm complaining because he was allowed to govern us at all . " " I suppose he came along at the right moment , " the Monsignor said thoughtfully . " Just at the time when our people were beginning to flex their muscles and look around for a spokesman . And there was Skeffington , the man for the times . I guess you could say the wrong man . " " I guess you could , " the Cardinal said grimly . " A scoundrel from the beginning . It was the right time , and our people did need somebody . Very well . The same thing was occurring in other cities at just about the same time . In New York , for example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , while we produced Frank Skeffington . We have been answeringfor it ever since . " " I remember some years ago doing research for a paper , " the Monsignor said , " and coming across some of his speeches when he first became mayor . The funny thing was that I thought they were good speeches . I had the feeling that here was a man of exceptional ability who might really have been something , and that when you thought of what he might have been , his whole story actually became a kind of personal tragedy . " " You had that feeling , did you ? " the Cardinal said , in sudden fierce derision . " You now support the Great Man Gone Wrong theory ? " The Monsignor said calmly , " I do n't know about the great , ' Eininenza . It 's just that he seemed to be head and shoulders above the others at that time , and that he also seemed to have some extremely sound ideas on the management of a city . " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bankruptcy today . We have had your man of exceptional ability to lead us there . I heard only this morning that all the banks have refused to lend the city a comparatively small sum because k is considered such a poor risk . You young people seem to have the most wildly romantic notions about this man : he is supposed to be some sort of wayward giant , a person of charm , cultivation and administrative genius , who has somehow misused his great-93gifts . All this is nonsense . I 've known Frank Skeffington all my life , and he is essentially a mediocre fellow , a cheap buccaneer with a talent for tricking the ignorant . Even leaving everything that is most important to one side , and taking him simply as a working municipal executive , he is haphazard , inefficient and dangerous . I know something about finance , " said the Cardinal truthfully , " and I can tell you , Monsignor , that your man of exceptional ability is a financial irresponsible in addition to everything else . Never mind his early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend the money . And if you want to read the record , read the last tax rate for the city . Better still , read the real tax rate instead of the announced one ; that will give some idea of the abilities of this peerless executive . " And yet , thought the Monsignor , a record of mismanagement did not necessarily indicate incapacity on the part of the manager ; it could just as easily indicate the unscrupulousness of an otherwise able official . The Monsignor was himself inclined towards this view . He felt that the Cardinal , for all his shrewdness , tended to sell Skeffington short ; the long decades of cumulativeirritations , of personal conflicts , of outrage over the latter 's ceaseless maneuvering to use for his own purposes the Church of which the Cardinal was a prince  --  all these had bred in the Cardinal a contempt so deep and persistent as to forbid objective evaluation . The Monsignor , who had no such personal involvement , felt himself to be capable of greater detachment ; Skeffington interested him and held his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old politician was surely a scoundrel ; but he felt too that he was a man of considerable parts . But now he did not press the point ; instead , on another tack , he said : " What really is astonishing is the loyalty he commands . And all in spite of some rather serious scandals . Even when he 's lost he 's always managed to come through with a tremendous vote . " " You do n't shoot Santa Claus , " the Cardinal said wearily . " Is n't that what Smith said about Roosevelt ? It 's much truer of Skeffington . He plays Santa Claus in person every morning in his own home . The people come to him with empty stockings and he fills them : with jobs , dentures , eyeglasses , money  --  what have you . Every day is Christmas Day at the mayor 's house ; this good  --  94  --  man gives to the needy out of his own pocket . The fact that all these personal gifts ultimately come out of public funds is neither mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these favors , that have bribed and bought the people forever . They 're good enough people and they 're not immoral ; they do n't even begin to understand what 's happened to them . And you can talk from now until doomsday and all they 'll understand is that no power on earth  --  and no scandal , however serious  --  can turn them against the man who shakes their hand , inquires solicitously for each member of their family by name in that mellow actor 's voice , and who does so much for them , day after day , year after year . They say , He 's one of our own , ' " he said bitterly , " and they say it with pride . He 's the poor Irish boy who made good and came out of the slums to wear a frock coat and sit in the governor 's chair , who puts ten dollars  --  ostentatiously  --  in the collection basket at ten o'clock Mass every Sunday , and who personally gives aid and comfort to the needy . They call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . ' " " I do n't know him at all , " the Monsignor said , with perhaps a faint regret . " That is your good fortune . I know him very well . And now , with your permission , or even without it , I think we can conclude this discussion . It disturbs me . " " Of course , Eminenza . " There was silence . The old Cardinal sat with his eyes closed , his lips slightly parted , his hands folded across the front of his soutane . He might have been napping , for he sometimes now fell off to sleep in an instant . The Monsignor rose and began to arrange the study desk for the next morning ; as he worked he thought of the two old antagonists and their feuds of a bygone age . They were feuds now almost over ; the Monsignor knew that he would one day inherit their fruits , and there were times  --  such as now  --  when he rather wistfully regretted that he had not been present , long years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big frame house by the reservoir , Charlie Hennessey was entertaining Mother Garvey . It was unscheduled entertainment , for Charlie had not expected a visitor ; he had been prepared for- 95  --  another of the lonely , lively , bustling evenings that he so enjoyed . He was almost always alone these nights , but he was never lonesome , for he was excellent company for himself , and there was always so much to do , so much to keep up with . Charlie liked to keel , up with the latest developments in all fields . He was a sallow , happy tub of a man in his fifties with bulging excited eyes ; every night he roamed about his house at a joyous half-trot , whistling loudly and tunelessly . He fed the horsemeat to the hounds , and if he thought of it he fed himself . Sometimes he hurled himself into a chair to read anything that was handy  --  this was a part of his " keeping up " : he subscribed to twenty widely various magazines ; he bought , borrowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibers , bee breeding , miracle drugs , criminology in the New Japan , packaged waffle mixes  --  and sometimes he paused to switch on his tape recorder . He would talk into it without hesitation for a half-hour or more and then , returning to it much later in the evening , he would listen with appreciation to the words he had spoken . " Marvelous , marvelous ! " he cried aloud . He did a little skating dance around the room in his enthusiasm , his tartan cap tilted rakishly on his head . " Is n't it marvelous how we can preserve our thoughts for the ages , and all on a little spool of Scotch tape ? The books of the future will all be on spools ! Marvelous ! We 're living in an age of miracles ! " Sometimes he turned on the television set ; he watched the President of the United States deliver a somber evaluation of the state of the nation , and as he watched he snapped his fingers happily and shouted at the television screen . " No capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A square peg in a round hole ! Great on a parade ground : hup , two three four ! Oh , marvelous ! But in the White House ! Mother of God , save us all from Fort Riley , Kansas ! Oh pitiful , pitiful ! " And he whistled again , loudly . Then , his eyes still fixed on the screen , he edged across the room and rather absently retrieved a valuable library book from the mouth of one of the hounds , who had been chewing it for some time . But tonight Mother Garvey was a visitor , his small , truculent body sunk deep among the dog hairs that covered his chair and ,  --  g6  --  indeed , every piece of furniture in the house . He was a singlemindedman and he had come here tonight on a mission , yet the first sight of his host had startled him and momentarily diverted him from his purpose . He said querulously , " Why the hell d'ye have a thing like that on your head , a man your age ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and examined it carefully . " You ought to wear one yourself , my dear man , " he said , " for reasons of health . It 's grand protection against colds ; it keeps the temperatureeven on top of the head , a very vulnerable area . I have the best of recent medical opinion to back me on that . This is a marvelous cap in many ways , a tribute , you might say , to our day and age . What do you suppose it 's made out of , my dear man ? " " I do n't give a damn if it 's made out of peanut butter , " Garvey said irritably . " They 'll be comin ' for you with a net and I wo n't be the one to blame them . A cap ! " " Dacron ! " Charlie said , replacing the cap on his head even more annoyingly : the visor now rested slight above his left ear . " That 's what it 's made out of , my dear man : zoo per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature : the best of the new fabrics , the du Pont people down in Wilmington put it out , it 's made from lumps of coal . It 'll drive the wool people out of business in ten years . Think of the implications of that , my dear man ! Put your brain on that for a while ! A gigantic industry like the wool industry ruined by a chemist in Delaware ! In fifteen years there wo n't be a sheep left in the country . Eat your lamb chops now while you can , my dear man ! We 're living in an age of scientific miracles ! " " For the love of God , " Garvey said loudly , suddenly remembering his mission . " The whole entire city tied up in knots by the well-known pome reader on the Avenue , and you gas away about caps and lamb chops ! " " My hat 's off to the poem reader ! " Charlie said . " Oh , he has a grand technique ! Marvelous , you ca n't beat it ! A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole life , and half the city thinks he 's the world 's greatest expert on Shakespeare ! And the fact of the matter is , my dear man , that he 's abysmally igno -- 97  --  rant on the subject . Oh , abysmally ! The man never read a book : the whole thing 's a legend . Up to ten years ago he thought that Shakespeare 's first name was John ! I had to put him straight on that one myself , just so 's he would n't shame the city . John ! Oh , there 's no culture there , no culture at all , positively none ! But a great technique ! " Waving his arms up and down , Charlie slipped into an uncannily accurate reproduction of the famous Skeflington voice . " ' Good morning , ladies . On this lovely spring morning , I awoke to the music of the birds outside my window , and I could n't help thinking , as I listened , of those magnificent immortal words of the poet who wrote , Hail to thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And the good women never suspect , " said Charlie in his own voice , " that the man himself read the line for the first time half an hour ago on the back of a label for codfish cakes ! Or on the side of a breakfast food box . He memorizesthem while he eats ; I know the man well . Marvelous ! He 's got them all buffaloed , yourself included , my dear man ! " " For the love of God , will you listen a bit ! " Garvey cried , his combative face reddening further . The world 's greatest living gas-bag , he thought , and getting worse by the day . But still , a man with a following and a murderer on a public platform , a man who could shout you to death at a rally , and a much better friend than foe . Less aggressively he said : " The pomes have no importance . The point is this , Charlie : Here 's the city goin ' over the hill to the poorhouse , arse over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more years , just to make sure she gets there ! And what the hell are we doin ' about it ? Answer me that ! What the hell are we doin ' about it while he sticks his big mush in the public trough and says , ' Stand back , nobody gets any o ' this but me ! ' And by God they do n't . Nobody else gets so much as a smell , whilst him and his pals is suckin ' the city dry . My lovely mother , God have mercy on her soul , sized him up the first time she laid eyes on him . ' Festus , me son , ' she said , ' the man 's a greedy bastard ! ' And oh , was n't she right though ? The ma was always right . Here I stand , the man that give him his start , the man 's that 's give up his whole life to municipal service , the man that 's made a vertible paradise of the whole damn city , the man who put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkway , and today I can hardly get into City Hall to use the toilet ! That 's what the murderin ' scoundrel does to them that helped him ! He sits in his easy chair up in the mayor 's office , smokin ' cigars a foot long , handin ' out iron keys that do n't open nothin ' to coon cornet players , gettin ' rich hand over fist , whilst the man who made him what he is has to sneak in the back door to take a free pee ! Oh , " he shouted , the memory of personal indignities heightening his rage , " I say throw the rascal out of office ! That 's what 's got to be done and what the hell are we doin ' about it ? " Charlie examined him critically . " There 's a big vein twitching away at the side of your head , " he observed . " By the left temple . That could be a bad sign , my dear man . The blood pressure could be up very high , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do : never mind the doctors . Buy yourself a little kit and take your own pressure , that 's the thing . Just strap it around your arm and pump it up , and whenever you feel yourself throbbing away like a motorboat tell yourself to calm down . Say prayers , suck on a Life Saver , take a warm bath : anything to keep the pressure under control , my dear man . Otherwise a man your age could pop like a balloon some fine day . Or there 's a new drug out the Hindus discovered over in India : they make it out of a poison plant . I read about it the other day . One pill a day and you 're in slow motion . I 'll get the name of it for you to-morrow . " " Never mind the big veins in my head ! " Garvey shouted . " Never mind my blood pressure ! I did n't come here for that . For the love of God keep to the point , and the point is this : Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' scoundrel who 's gettin ' rich on the city and on us all ? Will you or wo n't you , Charlie ? " " Sense , sense , sense ! " Charlie said reprovingly . " Talk nothing but sense , my dear man ! I 'm surprised at a man like you paying attention to nut rumors ! Frank Skeffington a rich man : oh , marvelous ! And all nonsense ! The man 's not rich . He has no money , no money at all . It 's all legend . He 's stolen millions , but it 's gone , all gone , easy come easy go , like slush down amaaa'aole in March ! Frank does n't even want to be rich ; he has , to get lid99of the money . It 's a common psychological type , my dear man . You read about it all the time in the medical journals . He spends like the King of Armenia and he 's the softest touch in the city . There 's not a bum in town that does n't park on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Help ! I 'm a dying man ! ' Now you or I , my dear man , would call the cops and let him die a decent death in a prison , but Frank is always there with the ten-spot . Oh , good-hearted ! You have to say that for him . A c ook and no culture , never reads a book in spite of what people think , but a grand heart . When he dies he wo n't have a quarter and the family wo n't even be able to pay for a casket . I 'll have to bury him myself . I 'll have to call up the telephone company and say , Good morning ! This is Charles F. Hennessey . Have you got an old booth about eight feet long and two feet wide that you 're not using today ? I want to bury the mayor ! ' Oh , marvel- ous ! " Garvey felt weak . Fury had left him ; he was drained of all emotion . It was the way , really , he had expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the first few minutes with Charlie . He entered always with determination , with a purpose . Then came the anger . Then , floating towards him , came the words , the soft , thick , suffocating mass which moved irresistibly forward , growing ever larger as it moved , the cloud of nerve-gas dropped upon an enemy host to leave it bathed in lassitude and powerless to resist . It was without a doubt the greatest weapon in Charlie 's arsenal . " What the hell , " Garvey said weakly . " All right , Charlie . All right . Only one thing , that 's all I want to know : Are you out to lick hirn ? " " Of course I 'm out to lick him , " Charlie said . " Why my dear man , I 'm running for mayor myself ! " " Charlie , " said Garvey , " you ca n't win . We know that , the both of us . By God , all things bein ' equal and fair bein ' fair , you 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your side yellin ' Hip-hip-hooray ! There 's no man deserves it more than you , Charlie . But what the hell , with this gang of double-crossin ' murderers and their dirty money to buck , you have n't got a  --  Chinamun 's chance . The same damn thing will happen as last  --  ioo  --  time and the time before  --  twenty thousand votes and no more , and what the hell use is that in a city this size ? What I come here for tonight , Charlie , was to say : Come in with us . Come and join up with us like the smart man that you are . We 'll lick the murderer together , the both of us , and carve him up like a Christmas turkey ! " " Ah my dear man , winning 's not everything ! " Charlie said . " No no no ! The thing is to take the matter to the people , to let them know what 's going on , to fight the good fight , to tell the truth ! Marvelous ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city every night of the campaign , lashing away at them all ! Skeffington and the rest of them ! The big boys against Skeffington are just as bad and worse ! I 'll stand on the side lines and harass away , harass away ! Marvelous ! They fear it . They fear it more each year . One man telling the truth to the people ! A time-bomb ! " As crazy as a bedbug , thought Garvey morosely , but still , a great man in the corner . Adopting the wheedling tones of diplomacyto which , by nature , he was so astonishingly ill-suited , he said : " But s'pose you could win too , Charlie ? By bein ' the power behind the man who 's sure to win ! I 'm backin ' a great lad this time , Charlie . A good , clean-livin ' young man after your own heart . A young man , a college graduate , trained by the Jesuit Fathers themselfs . And smart as a whip , Charlie ! A leadin ' attorney-at-law , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vet'ran  --  by God I do n't know but he might of been wounded in action ; I see him walkin ' with a little limp the other day  --  a fine family man , and the father of five at the age of thirty-five ! And if that ai n't enough , he 's a handsome lad with a great personality , and he 's way up there in both the K. of C. and the Elks ! Now what the hell more could you ask of a man , answer me that , Charlie ? Our next mayor , sure as God made little apples . Mayor Kevin McCluskey ! D'ye happen to know him , Charlie ? " " McCluskey ! " said Charlie . " I-Ioly Cross College , Class of 1940 . Georgetown University School of Law , Class of 1943 . Into the Navy an ensign , out a lieutenant . No wounds , none at all , my dear man ! I know all about him . I 've made the usual investigation of all the rivals . Oh , thoroughly , my dear man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as the F.B.I . McCluskey ! A nice pleasant lad , a good Catholic , and no capacity whatsoever ! Oh , none at all , the poor boy ! " Garvey stared at him in speechless outrage ; Charlie continued . Ile was slumped low in his chair , and his cap had slipped forwardover his eyes . As he talked he snapped his fingers in peppy punt tuation . " Mediocre ! Mediocre in school , in college , and in the law school , my dear man ! I 've seen the records , I 've talked with the teachers ! Oh , undistinguished ! Poor in sports ! I 've talked to the coaches ! Something wrong with the co-ordination : could n't catch a ball if you threw it right at him ! Slow in the reflexes ! Slow in body , slow in mind ! No capacity ! Passed the bar on the strength of being a veteran ! Oh , I 'll have to tell the people the truth about him on the platform . I 'll have to say , Dear friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a good-looking youngsterwith nothing upstairs but a mass of floating custard . You 're being asked to put at the switchheads of the city a handsome young fellow who wears hundred-dollar suits , Panama straw hats , and says , **38;10235;TOOLONG ? ' at parish dances . Marvelous ! Nice manners , dear friends ! Nice ! But when he adds up two and two he gets five and a half for an answer , and when he sued the city two years ago for Danny Dacey he lost poor Danny the case all because he thought all the banks were closed on Groundhog Day ! He thought it was a legal holiday , dear friends ! I refer you to the records ! Oh , a grand young man , but simple ! And last year  --  ' " You silly bastard ! " Garvey yelled . He had risen in a fury and was standing over Charlie , screaming down at him . " Nearly sixty years old and sittin ' in a chair , dreamin ' up dirty fairy-tales about a clean-livin ' young man who 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lost all your buttons years ago ! You 're a loony ! I do n't know why I ever come out here to talk to the likes of you ! You wo n't be elected garbageman when I 'm through with you ! Good night and t ' hell with you ! " " Watch the pressure , " Charlie said warningly . " The big vein is working again , pumping away , pumping away ! And do n't step on the dog 's paw when you go out , my dear man . He some --  102 - times lies in front of the door . And good luck in your campaign . May the best man win . You 've got a grand simple boy there , my dear man ! " With a final shout , Garvey was gone ; Charlie heard the front door slam . The interview had not left him in any way disturbed ; in fact he had already forgotten about Garvey and his candidate , for now that he was alone he suddenly remembered a small ex- periment that he had intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had read about only the day before . He closed his eyes , and breathed evenly , steadily ; he placed three fingers of his right hand lightly on the inside surface of his left wrist . He was taking his pulse . Now , quickly , he inhaled deeply and held his breath ; instantly the pulse decelerated and with delight he noted that it was fading , fading , almost to nothing at all . It might have been the pulse of a dying man , yet here he was , loo per cent in the pink of condition . Healthy ! The steady diminu- tion of the pulse down to the merest whisper purely by holding the breath . Marvelous ! A grand illustration of one of the little tricks the human body plays upon us all ! The way the draft-dodgers had fooled the doctors in the last World War . . . He exhaled , breathed normally again , and the pulse returned to its strong , steady beat . Marvelous , marvelous ! One more bit of up-to-date knowledge stored away for ready reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse was important , thought Charlie , oh yes indeed ! He was happy . In his happiness he leaped up , playfully rapped the nearest hound across the muzzle , and made his way with rapid little skating steps across the room to where his tape-recorder lay . At a moment like this , there was only one thing to be done . He picked up the micro- phone and began to talk , rapidly and without pause ; many min- utes later he was still talking . 4jIn the handsome eighteenth-century dining room of the city 's oldest and proudest club , Nathaniel Gardiner was finishing his dinner . He was a bulky man in his seventies , with a large , pale and faintly freckled face ; light gray eyes looked out steadily and pleasantly from behind old , steel-rimmed glasses which seemed slightly too small for the face they fronted . He was dressed- 103 - neatly in neutral , inexpensive , anonymous clothing , for although he spent annually great sums of money , he spent very little on himself . Ile was a man of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally able attorney ; he was somethingrarer than any of these : he was , genuinely , a philanthropist , almost the last of a remarkable species that had once flourished in the city . I le lived alone now , in a room in the club . He lived so out of choice . His three sons were married and had homes of their own in the suburbs ; separately they came in to dine with him every week , not out of a sense of duty , but because they wished to . None of them really quite understood their father , but they loved him , and they knew that he was a remarkable man . They knew , too , that from these weekly meetings came practical advantage , for they silently acknowledged that in the profession which they also had adopted this elderly man of placid appearancewas still able to show them the way . Tonight he was joined by his youngest son . Dinner over , they sat quietly by the tall windows , looking out through the neardarknessof the long August evening into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , at this time of evening and at this time of year , was almost deserted ; save for the single old waiter , hovering inconspicuously by the door leadinginto the kitchen , the two men were alone . " And now for the sixty-four-dollar question , " the son said . He was a dark , lean , brisk young man with the face of a handsomehorse . " I meant to ask it as soon as I came in , and th  --  n  --  ; e began to talk about Ted and the Fabricant business . hat what about this latest announcement of our esteemed mayor ? Did you expect it ? " " Oh yes , " Gardiner said calmly . " Yes , I fully expected it . I could n't quite see Frank Skeffington doing anything else . " " Then you 're not too disappointed over last night 's developments ? " " I 'm not disappointed at all , " Gardiner said tranquilly . " I leave that to you young fellows . Are you disappointed , Dan ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner we can get rid of him the better , and I really thought he just might finally  --  104  --  decide to call it a day this time . There seemed to be a few rather definite signs that he would . " " So there were . I 'm afraid , however , that they were signs he put up himself . " Gardiner laughed gently . " He 's a rogue . A complete rogue . And yet the most engaging rogue I 've ever met . I admit to having a small soft spot in my heart for our mayor . " " Yes , I know you have . " It was one of the strange streaks in his father that the son did not comprehend ; he said , " Why ? Charity 's charity , but ca n't you push it a little too far ? " " Can you ? I suppose you can . In theory , at least ; I 've never seen anyone who has . However , I was n't thinking of charity at all in Skeffington 's case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever met him ? " " No . " Then , feeling the admission to be to some extent a damaging one , he added , " But I know all about him . " A fugitive , almost invisible smile wreathed its way across his father 's face , but he said merely : " I 've known him quite well for many years . And for two years , before you were born , I worked with him rather closely . During the First World War a Citizens ' Committee was started and I was its chairman . We had meetings every month with Skeffington , who was mayor then too . I wo n't say that the arrangement was altogether satisfactory , but it worked out well enough for a bipartisan system . Eventually the inevitableconflicts arose and it was disbanded , but not before I found out quite a lot about Skeffington and even became rather well acquainted with him . He 's really a most unusual man . I. 3l.ks to him our monthly meetings were considerably brighter than they might otherwise have been . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or are you saying , Father , that he was n't such a thief after all ? " " Oh no . He stole . How much I have no idea ; the estimates vary widely . I presume he still does , although I 'm not in such close touch with these matters as I used to be . " " But in spite of that , you still have the soft spot ? " Gardiner nodded , smiling at his son . " I do . I hope you realize that does n't imply an endorsement of his candidacy . Through the years I 've been rather consistently opposed to Skeffington . I think I know him fairly well , and just about what he stands  --  105  --  for . I do n't think I ever opposed him because of who he was or where he came from or where he went to worship . These considerationsnever seemed to me terribly important in any case . " It was quite true . In the city , in addition to parks , to playgrounds , to gardens that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the young men who owed , literally , almost everything to him . They were , most of them , poor , strangersto him , subscribing to beliefs and traditions alien to his own . he selected them regularly and carefully from the rosters of the secondary schools ; he sent them through college and university ; afterwards , if assistance was needed , it was he who supplied it . The work was one he had begun years ago , not merely because he was a generous man , but because of a curious , almost anachronisticsense of obligation . He had a deep ineradicable love for this city where he had spent his life , and which he and his family had helped to build ; by underwriting the education of these young men of promise he sought to protect , in some measure , the city 's future . It was largely an isolated labor , and one which so far had produced few encouraging results ; neverthelesshe was quietly convinced of its value in the long run , and in any case he could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of the citizen who could afford it . Like all Gardiner 's philanthropies , this one was unpublicized ; few people knew about it . His sons , of course , knew something of the arrangement , but they did not know of its extent . Had they known , they would have been surprised , they would have been puzzled , they would not have been particularly sympathetic . Only their great respect for their father would have prevented strong objection . Gardiner knew this ; he sometimes wondered , when he talked to his sons , whether they who seemed to have overcome so many of the old passionate prejudices of their ancestors had not also managed to overcome some of their old passionate virtues ? In these neutral , tolerant times , did anyone really feel deeply about anything ? Or was he , on the other hand , in the first stages of becoming an old fogey ? He smiled to himselfand then , looking at his son , he thought : At least they feel deeply about Skeffington . . . . Or did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violent shouts and empurpled  --  io6  --  faces that the name of Skeffington could occasion among his own contemporaries ; he concluded that , even here , they swam in the new emotional shallows . In a sense , of course , it was a good thing ; but still , he thought , but still .. . " You have me wondering about that soft spot , " said his son . " For example , would you even consider supporting Skeffington in an election ? " " Oh no . Not now . Although there was a time , very early in his career , when I did . I think he was quite surprised , and I know that several of our friends were . " He laughed quietly . " I remember particularly the reaction here in the club . I did n't support him for long , to be sure , but long enough to be considered a bit of a traitor . I must say that it seemed a logical step at the time . The city needed a little fresh air and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't a man without ideas , you know . Some of his early proposals were farsighted , humanitarian , and most attractive . " " And these proposals , " asked his son , " did they ever get off the drawing board ? Did they ever become anything more than pro-posals ? " " Some of them did , yes . You know you really must n't believe everything that Amos says about Skeffington in that newspaper of his . Amos is a decent enough fellow but he 's not entirely rational on the subject of Skeffington . What should be remembered to Skeffington 's credit is that our first substantial slumclearingprogram , for example , was entirely his . And he was far more receptive than any of his predecessors to suggestions for providing facilities for the health and recreation of the public . IIe saw what needed to be done , and in more than a few ways he marched ahead and did it . He always had a certain fearless vigor which I rather admired . Along with this , however , he had a capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . " " So no matter what you say , " his son said , with an air of triumph , " you come right back to the important thing , and that is that he 's a crook . No matter how many swings or seesaws he may have put up , did n't he line his pockets on every one ? And did n't they make jobs for his loafer friends ? "  --  Io7 - " Oh yes . All kinds of public featherbedding and thievery began and continued . I do n't really know to what extent Skeffingtonpersonally profited from all this  --  I expect it was rather less than most people imagine  --  but there 's no doubt at all that he was chiefly responsible . I do n't for a moment condone it ; I agree with you that it was a disgrace . I think I said a few minutes ago that I considered Skeffington a rogue . " " An engaging rogue , " his son said quickly . " An engaging rogue , " Gardiner agreed . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes a difference to me . I know that it should n't , but unfortunately it does . It 's rather hard to condemn totally a man with whom one has had an agreeable personal association . This is especially true when one considers that some of those who have condemned him most vigorously have n't done so with entirely clean hands . I wo n't go into the untidy business of naming names , but I know several reputable citizens connected with our banks and utilities who , with perfect legality , have stolen far more from the city than has Skeffington . The distinction between private and corporate theft is a neat one ; I 've never been quite able to accept it . Nor , I would imagine , has Skeffington . I recall , once , when he was the governor , that he addressed a small , influential , and extremely hostile group of men made up in good part of these same people . He wanted their support for some measure  --  I forget now exactly what it was  --  and here 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three quarters of an hour before he appeared . Then he began to talk to them , stressing particularly the differencesbetween them and himself : the differences in background , in political faith , in belief , and so on . And then , when he 'd done this for several minutes , he announced that whatever their differences may have been , at least they were alike in one respect . ' We are united , gentlemen , in what is , when you come to think of it , a very considerable accomplishment , ' he said . ' We 've all managed to stay out of jail ! ' " Behind the small glasses , the light gray eyes twinkled . " The boldness of it ! " he said . " The supreme impudence of the man ! He absolutely took their breaths away . Oh yes , Dan , a most engaging man . " " I suppose so , " said his son skeptically . " All the same , I do n't  --  io8  --  quite square a story like that with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted their support . Do you mean that after that he got it ? " " No . Indeed he did not . But I 've always suspected that once he got inside that room that night and saw all those grim , dis- approving faces staring at him , he may have decided that he wanted to get something rather than support . He may have decided , " said Gardiner slowly , " to get a bit of his own back . And if so , he surely succeeded ! " The son said nothing . For a few moments the two men sat silently by the darkening window . Outside , the new street lights had been turned on ; the weird bluish illumination soaked through the evening fog which had just begin to come in off the water . Inside the room , there was a sudden heavy metallic clash- ing as the old waiter dropped some silver ; the sound was cut off sharply , the old man smothering it in shocked apology . Gardiner turned and regarded his son with fond good humor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All finished , " the son said . " Nothing more I can give you ? Brandy ? " " No , no , not a thing , thanks , Father . I 'm in fine shape . " " Good . We 'll go into the library then . But before we do , " he said , " I imagine I should define my position on Skeffington just a little more clearly for you . I ca n't have you going home think- ing I 'm altogether irresponsible . " The son began a protest , but the older man smilingly waved it away . " Bear in mind above all that I 'm fundamentally opposed to Skeffington . Apart from his first campaign , I 've never helped him . I think he did some extremely good and necessary things for the city  --  things which , but for him , would probably not have been done at all  --  but also some disastrous ones . J think that as an elected public official he has been dishonest , partial to his own , and vindictive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that perhaps there might have been some reason for all the partiality and vindictiveness . They did n't spring from a vacuum , you know . I know something about Skeffington 's early life in this city ; it was n't very agreeable . He had rather a hard time of it , and so did his family and most other families like it ;  --  109  --  I 'm afraid some of us did n't help matters much . And so , because Skefington has an excellent memory , there was a certain amount of revenge . I do n't say this to excuse his conduct . A bigger man and a better man would have acted differently . But unfortunately we 're talking about Skeffington and the way he acted , and all I 'm attempting to do is to show you why , to some extent , I sympathize with him . He 's a man with many qualities I like , even admire , and with many others that I deplore ; I simply say that one has to look at both sides of the coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that on the whole Skeffington has been a political misfortune for the city . But I should also say that he had  --  and has  --  another side , and when he goes , he will be missed by many , many people . Including , I 'm afraid , myself . And with that confessionof an old man 's weakness , " he said , pushing his chair back from the table , " I suggest we adjourn to the library and get back to business . I want to go over that Thayer case with you once more . I agree with you that it may prove to be somewhattrickier than it looks . " Together father and son left the dining room and went into the library ; here , at least , in the discussion of legal procedure , they would meet on common ground ... . Adam and Maeve were at a party given by the Mangans . Like all Mangan parties , this was distinguished by noise , confusion , quite a lot to drink , and rather too little food . The principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of indigestiblelumps , in a casserole . It had run out even sooner than had been expected ; as it had not been very good , this had not mattered much . Despite the food , Adam was enjoying himself . He liked both Jack and Nancy Mangan , and he sat now talking to Nancy , who had folded herself onto the divan with a vast collapsing sigh , and who , in her mid-thirties , was just a little rounder and just a little blonder than when he had first known her , fifteen years before . She was also , now , slightly tipsy , or so Adam thought ; with Nancy it was not always easy to be sure . They were talking about Little Simp . " But it 's so wonderful ! " Nancy said breathlessly . She said everything a little breathlessly , each phrase given its apparatus- 110 - of rapturous significance . Strangers , when first meeting Nancy , were often delighted by the dazzling attention accorded them by this handsome , full-bodied woman until they discovered , somewhatto their discomfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a child toe dancer , a new recipe for an inedible dessert  --  received precisely the same attention . " I mean it , " she said urgently . " I really do mean it , Adam . I love it . Jack loves it . Everybody loves it . Does Maeve love it ? I 'll bet she does . " " I 'll bet she does too . She 's a very loyal wife . " " I know . She 's young , she 's lovely , she 's loyal : I love Maeve . Adam , " she said dreamily , " how much younger is Maeve than you ? " He laughed . " O.K. , O.K. , " he said . " Any time you want to stop shooting it 's all right with me . " She smiled slightly ; they were old friends . " Anyway , " she said , " you 're a lucky man . Because she is lovely . Did you know there was a time when you could have married me ? Ages ago , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Adam ? You did n't , did you ? " Adam grinned . " You always kept your secrets well , Nancy . No , I did n't . " And neither , he reflected , did anyone else , for this courtship had no relation to reality . Late in the evening , and under certain conditions , Nancy could be counted upon to view the past through the extraordinary prism of her own recollections ; others who had lived in this past came upon the re-creation of it with something of the same sense of wonder with which they might have come upon the lost Atlantis . " But it all worked out so beautifully , did n't it ? " she said . " I mean , here you are married to Maeve and you 're happy , and here I am married to Jack and I 'm happy , and it 's all so much ... so much ... " " Happier . " " Yes , that 's it . I really do n't think , Adam , that you would have been terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly , but I do n't think you would . And I tell you something else : I do n't think I would have been happy married to you . Can you forgive me for saying that to you ? "  --   --  " I can forgive you anything , Nancy . I can even forgive you your cooking . " " I know , " she said , nodding . " The casserole . Was it awful ? " " Pretty awful , yes . " " Nobody seemed to want more and that was all right , because there was n't any more . I do n't know , I think either you 're a burn cook , or you 're not a born cook , and I 'm not , so that 's all there is to it . And then I really do n't care much about food so I do n't suppose that helps . " " We might have been an ideal couple at that , " Adam said . " Everything would have been in our favor : I have a digestive tract of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , coming up behind the divan . He was a heavy , slightly rumpled man , with quick energetic movements ; he reached over now and smacked his wife lightly across the rump with the flat of his hand . " Get going , sport , " he said . " Mingle with the guests , attend to their wants . I want to talk to Adam for a minute . I want to tell him about the cook he could have married if he 'd been really smart . " " Ha ha ha , " she said lazily , pushing herself up . " And to think I have to leave , just when the conversation 's going to become so wonderfully witty . And all about food , too . " " You see my unique problem as a host , " Jack said , as she went off . " I 'm faced with the constant imbalance between food and drink , the one needed to neutralize the other in order to avoid the final shambles . Yet ours is the only house in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Result : the possibility of chaos descending . Solution : the hell with it . Listen , I have a proposition for you . " " My second today , " Adam said , and thought of Skeffington . " What ? No , never mind , I 'll tell you what the deal is . It 's about the comic strip , in a way . You could help me out , strike a blow on the side of the angels , and maybe turn a pretty penny for yourself . Interested ? " " I do n't know yet . Some parts of the proposition sound better than others . I liked that bit about the pretty penny well enough . " " More details , " Jack said . " Here 's the scoop . " The scoopproved to be a plan for a political comic book ; it was to be  --  112  --  sponsored by the veterans ' group for which Jack was legal counsel , and in which he was a guiding spirit . The group was political , it was Democratic , it was liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon in the state elections of the following year , and the direct target was to be the incumbent Republican governor . " A turd , " Jack explained . " A well-born turd , but a turd nevertheless . A complete reactionary . The nineteenth-century mind at work , and not a good one at that . The abolition of the cat-o ' - nine- tails marks the ultimate in progressive legislation . Anything after that is dangerous . On top of everything else , a social snob and stuffy as hell . Ridicule might be the best way of getting at him . Or so we think . A good job of derision . " " What do you want me to do : put Little Simp in the Civil Liberties Union ? " " No . What the hell , no jokes , sport . We do n't want you to use Little Simp . You probably could n't anyway . The paper would kick up a fuss ; they 'll be backing the governor up to the hilt . All we want is your ability as a caricaturist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looked at in a certain light , the governor'sa first-class comic figure . All you have to do is shed that light . It might even be a lot of fun for you . " " It does n't sound much like fun . " " Plus profit , " Jack said . A figure was named , which seemed to Adam , if not generous , at least fair . However , he shook his head . " I do n't think so , Jack . The price is right , but the trouble is that all this business is n't exactly my kind of country . I do n't want to get mixed up in it . And there 'd be all sorts of complicationswith the paper and the syndicate . I would n't mind that too much if it were anything I really cared about doing , but it is n't . I 'd just as soon you got yourself another boy . " " Right , " Jack said briskly . " No bones broken , sport . " He was a matter-of-fact man , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of his cause , but he was neither hurt nor surprised when his friends failed , as they so often did , to fall in with his plans . On the whole , he rather expected it , and if , suddenly , they had agreed with him , he would have been mildly pleased but also just a bit alarmed , and he would immediately have begun the i c-examination of his own position . " The stuff is there to be  --  113  --  done , " he said , " and I thought you might want a shot at it . We 'll pass it along to somebody else . Keep it under your hat for a while though , will you ? " " All right . And thanks again for the thought . By the way , this is just for next year 's state elections ? You 're not using it in the city this fall ? " " No point in it , sport . We 're out to knock off the Republican control ; the city election is a one-party affair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in it , except secondarily . Which reminds me , how 's your uncle ? I have n't seen him in a couple of months . " " He seems in great shape . I saw him this afternoon in City Hall . " " What a place . They ought to burn the whole dump down and everybody in it . Except your uncle . He 's the only really able man in the whole setup . " " So ? Now that surprises me  --  I mean , that you think so . " " Oh hell yes . I do n't like him but he 's a powerhouse in that league . And pretty damn good in any league . A big-timer , your Uncle Frank , sport . " " I see . " He said , " Look , I suppose this secondary interest of yours in the city election will extend to the support of a candidate , wo n't it ? " " Sure . Naturally . " " But you would n't say that candidate would be my uncle ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suggestion had genuinely startled him . It was rare , even among his friends , that his purpose and that of his organization had been so monstrously misunder-stood . " Well , " said Adam , " why not ? You 're the one who 's always talking about the logic of politics . I should think it would be fairly logical to support a man whom you regard as a big-timer . " Jack glanced at him with some surprise . " You really interested in this ? " he said . " You really want to know what we think ? " " I do . " " An encouraging sign , " Jack said . " Possibly the dawning of a political consciousness . We 'll snake you into the group yet , sport . O.K. We 've got all kinds of reasons , but three ought to do  --  114  --  it for now . One , we ca n't count on him . He 's able , sure . Just for your own information , he 's probably ten times as able as the candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fine ! " " No , now wait . Ability 's great , but there comes a time when you have to say to hell with it . When it 's just ability , that is . Your uncle 's the ablest politician to come down the pike in these parts in the last fifty years . O.K. , what does that mean ? It means that he knows what should be done and he knows the way to do it . What it does n't mean is that he will do it . In fact we feel the evidenceshows he wo n't . Judging by past performance , and so on . " " Corruption at the core ? " Jack shrugged . " Call it what you want . The fact is that he 's just too tied up to do a good job . Tied up with too many people who lose out if changes are made , too many outfits to play ball with , too many old pals on the city payroll . To give the city a good administration he 'd have to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss himself , sport , but he wo n't do it . First , because he does n't want to , and second , because it 's too close to the end of the line . It 's not the way he plays . So there 's the picture . We prefer to go along with our own boy . He 's no whiz , but he 's not a dunce , and he 's got what the medieval boys called ' the disposition-to-the-good . ' He may not know how to deal the cards too well , but he 'll learn , and meanwhile it 's a little safer to sit in with him than it is with Riverboat Phil . " " No names ? " Adam asked . " Who is this object of faint praise ? " Jack shook his head . " Not yet . See me in a couple of weeks ; we 'll be ready to announce then . But about the second reason  --  you want to hear it ? " " Sure . Shoot . " " O.K. Well , we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport . The world has passed him by . You 're supposed to run a government today according to a few rules , a few laws . All that personal leadership was the thing around the turn of the century , but no more . Your uncle 's one idea of government is oldhatpaternalism . Nothing on the books , just one man passing out the jobs and Christmas baskets to the kiddies . So what we want to know is what happens when daddy dies , or if he does n't  --  115  --  happen to like one of the kids ? And what we like is a few ideas , a few principles , a few guaranteed rights set down in black and white  --  minimum wage , FEPC , that sort of thing . That 's the kind of talk we understand and your uncle doesn't. . , may be for t he underprivileged , but he wants to decide who they are and what they 're to have , himself . The old boss principle . Governmentby favor , pre-Roosevelt style . Obsolete as the windmill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mangan : the inevitableconsequence of drink plus the inedible . Anyway , you 've heard it all before , hundreds of times . All elementary collegeclassroomstuff , Government 3  --  A. But it 's true , nevertheless . Or true enough to make us duck your uncle in the fall . So saying , " he said , rising , " the host returns to his duties . Mobility is called for . Also , one drink . How about you ? " " Hold up a second , " Adam said . " What about that third rea-son ? " " What ? Oh , that . Well , in one way , sport , it 's the most importantof all . Practically speaking , that is . You see , " he said , " we just do n't think he 's going to win . " " I see , " Adam said thoughtfully . " Would you say that this reason was on a slightly different plane from the other two ? A little less quixotic ? " , " Sure . But then we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big-boy politics together . What we have on our side , maybe , is a few principles , a little integrity , a few decent aims . That 's all . And of course while we 're at it we 'd just as soon win . " Adam wondered , but he said , " One question more : you would n't care to tell me why you think he 's going to lose ? " " It's-too late in the day for him , sport . The Age of the Dinosaur-is-past . I 'd elaborate , " he said , " but for the fact that our cook of the evening has been giving me the hard eye for the last five minutes . Relief is required at the punch bowl . Coming along ? " " No , go ahead . I 'll join you later . " For a few minutes , Adam was alone . He considered first what he had just heard : none of it was new , none of it had surprised him . Yet he had listened tonight to the old information with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether  --  116  --  this was the mark of the committed  --  of even the partially committed  --  man . True , he was to be only a spectator , but as such he was bound to have an increased interest in the spectacle itself . He wondered idly which candidate Jack would support ; he thought that it would make little difference . Jack 's organization was articulate but small ; it had no considerable power . In the coming tug of war between it and Skeffington , Adam had little doubt as to whose pulling power was the stronger . And he had little doubt , too , as to which end of the rope his own sympathies inclined toward . But now all thought was interrupted by the sudden sweep of hunger : Adam was ravenous . Somewhat resentfully he gazed across the room at Nancy , the irresponsible agent of his hunger ; she was chattering away to a thin , pale , effervescent man who , like herself , presumably gave no thought to food . Adam looked for Maeve ; he began to calculate just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decency , abandon the party , and go somewhere , anywhere , where food could be obtained . He had not long to wait . Maeve caught his eye and his signal ; they left soon , and drove swiftly home , and there , in the kitchen , over a late-night supper of scrambled eggs and coffee , they slowly and sleepily and happily talked of the party , of the night and of the day . In this review there was one significant omission  --  they did not talk of Skeffington . Adam thought of doing so , then decided , looking at his wife , that there was , after all , no point in it at this time . It should be mentioned , certainly , and it would be  --  but later . There was no hurry . He would tell her in such a way that immediately she would see that his role was a harmless , even an amusing one ; he was confident that this could be done . But later , later .. . Skeffington was busy . Now a declared candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were , that night , four dinners which he was scheduled to attend ; he would eat at none but speak at all . He would speak longest at the most substantial of these . It was iii one of the downtown hotels ; he was driven there in the long official car , accompanied by Weinberg , Ditto Boland and Cuke- 117 - Gillen . It was Gillen who had arranged for the Fats Citronella ' presentation : he was an ex-vaudevillian who served Skeffington officially as the City Greeter  --  in which capacity he met importantvisitors to the city as they stepped down from plane or train  --  and unofficially as one of several court jesters . He was a small , spruce , agile man with a spike of gray moustache and thinning gray hair parted exactly in the middle ; somehow there hovered over him , like a coat of invisible dust , the aura of a bygone age of entertainment : the Keystone Cop , the solitary banjoist , the Old Soft Shoe , and the man in the boater and the blazer singing " Shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , penetrating nasal voice , and told stories in a variety of dialects . Sometimes , in the tiny office in City Hall which he shared with the Director of the Division of Plant Pest Control , he would break into bits of his old vaudeville routine : a few fast shuffle-off-to-Buffalo steps , hat tilted rakishly to one side , palms slapping thighs in syncopation , while he sang " Yes , We Have No Bananas , " which had been ingeniously arranged in the manner of the quartet from Rigoletto . Cuke sang all four parts ; it was his proudest boast that he could do this while at the same time keeping constantly in motion . His manner on official occasions , at airports and railway terminals , was somewhat more subdued ; nevertheless , touring dignitarieswere not infrequently startled and a bit bewildered by this spry figure in whose very approach , despite a certain strained gravity of facial expression and the civic uniform of morning clothes , there was contained the warning : GET READY FOR THE PRATFALL ! Now , as they drove from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked . It was at such moments as these that he knew reminiscence was both permitted and welcomed ; he reached deep into the pail of his extraordinary past . The touchstonehad been Ditto 's doleful complaint that , since lunch , he had had only a glass of milk . " I knew a man who took a bath in milk once , " Cuke said . " Out in Ashtabula one June , when we were playing a split week for short dough . He was my partner , Snapper Brady . You remember the Snapper , Governor ? "  --  118  --  " The one who looked like a turtle ? " Skeffington said . He was leaning back against the leather cushions , his eyes closed . " The same . When he had his hair cut , that is . But he was a whiz on the musical saw and a great little guy . Well , this time out in Ashtabula , it 's hot , and the Snapper is a great sufferer from the heat . Thin skin , the doctors said . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caked up in vaseline . It 's O.K. , but he feels greasy and he smells like an oil well . Then , all of a sudden , one morning he reads about this foreign dame in the Follies who takes milk baths for her skin , so before you know it he gets the milkman up to the room , points to the bathtub , and says , ' Fill it up ! ' You could have knocked the milkman over with a doily ! " " Possibly he was a little short of bathtub milk that morning , " Skeffington said . " It 's always the first to go . " Ditto laughed loudly . " Bathtub milk ! " he chortled . " Oh , that 's a good one , Governor . Yes , indeed it is ! " " Anyway , " Cuke said , " about two hours later I waltz into the room with a couple of dolls from the show . The bathroom door is wide open , and there 's the Snapper , up to his armpits in Grade A. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's O.K. , girls , I 'm all coveredup . You ca n't see through milk ! ' So in we go , and the first thing you know , just for a laugh , the Snapper reaches out for a glass , swoops it down through the milk , and comes up with it frill . ' Have a shot ! ' he says , handing it to one of the dolls . I 'll he damned if she do n't turn a little green and start to faint , and the two of them shoot out of the room and do n't speak to either one of us for two weeks ! " " I wish I 'd known the Snapper better , " Skeffington said . " One seldom meets a really gracious host these days . " " A barrel of fun , the Snapper , " Cuke agreed . " Anyway , I stick around for about half an hour while the Snapper splashes away in the tub , and pretty soon out he comes , all dried off . ' Snapper , ' I says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' Cuke , ' he says , ' it was lousy . I feel like a piece of cottage cheese ! ' And that was the last of milk for the Snapper ! " " ' Fare thee well , inconstant lover , ' " Skeffington said . " The Snapper and milk , parted forever . Sad to consider . A blow at the  --  119  --  vitals of the dairy industry . What 's the Snapper doing these days , by the way ? I hope he has n't abandoned his musical saw as well as his milk . " " Sure he has , " Cuke said . " He left the stage years ago , just about the same time I did . When vaudeville died . He 's out on the Coast , some town in the south of California . He 's got a city job : Director of Americanization . " " Director of Americanization , " Skeffington said . " I had n't thought of that one . It sounds good : what does a Director of Americanization do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kids and Mexicans up for their first papers . He teaches them about Paul Revere and his horse , and George Washington and the cherry tree , and how to pledge allegiance . " " The stage 's loss is the Republic 's gain , " Skeffington said . " Both yourself and the Snapper have wound up in municipal service : a startling coincidence , Cuke . It speaks well for the vaudeville of yesterday as an incubator of patriotism . " " Sure thing , " Cuke said . " Look at George M. Cohan . " The car stopped and Weinberg , who had been silent , now said , " O.K. We 're here . " Skeffington nodded . " Right . " He , Weinberg and Ditto got out of the car ; Cuke remained . Weinberg leaned back into the car and said , " We 'll be along in about half , three quarters of an hour . Keep ' em happy ' till we get there . " " Okey-doke , Sambo , " said Cuke . He winked and spanked his collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very same with which he had run onto hundreds of stages , his straw sailor at the familiar snappy angle , his luminescent tie firmly in place , and the orchestra playing " Glowworm . " " Leave everything to me , " he said . " I 'll lay ' em in the aisles . " For Cuke was functioning tonight , as he would function throughout the campaign , as a political advance man . He would go on to the next dinner , where , until Skeffington arrived , he would hold the guests with his assortment of dialect stories : Irish , Jewish , Italian , Negro , and English . He told these stories well , although his repertoire was not now nearly so extensive as once it had been ; Skeffington had pruned it ruthlessly . In- 120pained astonishment , the raconteur had seen dozens of his most reliable party pieces discarded because of indelicacy or on even more incomprehensible grounds . An artist , he had protested ; Skeffington 's answer had been brief and final . " We 're living in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I 'm not altogether sure you 're fully attuned to it . For example , if the Jewish Businessmen 's Association was having a small get-together and you were to speak at it , I have the feeling that your first story might begin with the words : ' A little Hebe named Epstein was walking down the street one day . . . . ' Now you may not realize it , but that kind of thing does n't exactly bring the Jewish vote swarming to my doors . So while I like you as a storyteller , and appreciate your fine personal qualities , I do n't think 1 ' 11 give you your head . Unless , of course , you depart from the little program I 've outlined for you and start telling stories on your own . Then , " he said jovially , " I 'll give it to you . On a platter . Better keep that in mind , Cuke . " Cuke had kept it in mind . As an added precaution , he had been given a short announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These stories are told purely in the spirit of good fun , " he would say , " and no offense is intended to any race , creed , or color . " He had not understood the necessity for this , any more than he had understood the necessity for trimming his stock , but still , when it was a question of one 's head , was understanding essential ? As a practical man who had known his ups and downs ; he had decided that it was not , and had obeyed without question . It was an obedience which Skeffington had fully expected . Now Skeffington and Weinberg walked side by side up the walk leading to the hotel ; slightly to the rear , Ditto automaticallybroke his stride , skipping to keep in perfect step with Skeffington . They had almost reached the doors of the hall when Skeffington sought from Weinberg the few details he would requirefor his address . Gesturing towards the hotel , he said , " Who 's it for ? " " McLaughlin , " Weinberg said . " Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did not recog --  121 - nizc the name , but he knew that it belonged to a younger man , and someone he had met fairly recently , for it was with names and faces encountered during the last few years that his cele- brated memory was not entirely efficient . In his detached analysis of himself , he knew that this , like his restricted diet , was an- other of the signs of increasing age ; it did not trouble him un- duly . At this stage of the game , it was to be expected , and more- over , there were mnemonics that could be relied upon . He said , " Enlighten me , Sam . " " You know him , " Weinberg said . " You remember the Legion convention in Chicago two years ago ? The drunken smush with the squint eye that kept spitting on your lapel ? " " I do indeed , " Skeffington said , with a grimace . " And that 's our honored guest of the evening ? " " Yeh . He died , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it easier , " Skeffington said . " It 's always easier to speak about a man like that in absentia . If he were there I 'd keep thinking of my lapels . I presume the widow is to be pre- sented with a memorial plaque of some kind ? The usual endur- ing bronze ? " " Yeh . The head of the Legion makes the presentation . After you speak . " " Good . How old was the man when he died ? " " Forty-three . " " And what did he do for a living ? " Weinberg 's gloomy face for just a moment lightened ; it was almost a smile . " A vetinary , " he said . Skeffington 's eyebrows lifted slightly . " A veterinary ! " he said . " Well , well . I hope he finds his consolation in that Big Kennel up yonder . Come on , let 's go in . " He and Weinberg entered the hotel , closely followed by Ditto . They were late , and intentionally so , for Skeffington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career he had dis- covered the dramatic value of the delayed entrance ; as a con- sequence , he was seldom on time for any public function . Al- though this habit of his was known to everyone , and although he never failed to make his appearance , however tardily , his hosts invariably grew nervous as the moments passed , and when finally- 122 - he arrived , as he did tonight , they greeted him in a flurry of nervous relief , born of the collapse of anxiety . Surrounding him , talking hurriedly , each one of the group eager to establish himself as one in intimate association with the Mayor , they hustled him into the dining hall ; it was a noisy , hectic progression , and served to distract the attention of everyone in the room from whatever happened to be taking place at the head table . This was still another advantage of the delayed arrival ; Skeffington often timed his turbulent entrance to coincide exactly with the spoken remarks of some valued opponent . In this way was the admirable effect of total disruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preliminaries over , he rose to speak . He waited until the room was absolutely quiet ; in the instant of waiting , his mind reached back into the crowded day and hovered momentarily over selected high spots : the interview with his nephew , the conference with Gorman and Weinberg , the rage-filled countenance of a prominent merchant who , at lunch , had been wrathfully examining his newspaper for further news of the Skeffington candidacy , and had suddenly looked up to see the candidate himself bowing ironically in his direction . These were satisfying thoughts ; among them was none concerned with either Eddie McLaughlin or the eulogy to come . This was a routine chore , accomplished almost without consciouseffort . He had the few necessary details ; he had sized up the head table in one quick glance ; he was ready . And now there was silence . " Mr. Toastmaster , Reverend Fathers , Mrs. McLaughlin , fellowLegionnaires , friends of Eddie McLaughlin , " he began . The words , at the beginning , were pitched low deliberately ; it was then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being said , and the maximum attention was immediately secured . The aging voice which still retained its richness now flowed in easy unhalting music , for with negligible variations it had played the same tune literally a thousand times before . " When I left the house this evening I said to Tom Lacy , my secretary , ' Tom , it looks like we have a busy evening ahead of us . ' He agreed . He said , ' Governor , you have eight separate speaking engagements , and all of them are important . ' And I answered , ' Tom , I do n't  --  123  --  care if I have a hundred and eight . There 's one I want to take care of before any of the others , no matter how important they may scent to be . And that one , ' " he said , his voice now accelerating , growing in power and emphasis , " ' is the dinner the Legion is giving in memory of that valued comrade  --  more than a valued comrade , that valued and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminal words , at the same time cutting them short ; this lent them the quality of a command from a cheerleader which could not conceivably be disobeyed . He was not disappointed ; applause cracked in , shouts arose , and once again he saw that the situation was well under control . He continued , speaking in a more solemn vein , for the tone was , after all , one of eulogy . At least , he thought , for the moment . " A tragic thing indeed that this young man was taken from us in so untimely a fashion . He was only forty-three , in the very flower of his manhood . There was still so much for him to do . Yet those of us who knew Eddie McLaughlin must be consoled by the fact of what he had already done . I think no one can deny that he has left his mark behind him , the ineradicable impression of his accomplishment . ' The evil that men do lives after them ; the good is oft interred with their bones ' this could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here tonight . He did no evil , and with no difficulty whatsoever , we remember the good . But I almost hesitate to speak of his good qualities on this occasion . I feel it 's very close to being an impertinence on my part , for there are others present , " he said , bowing slightly towards the widowed Mrs. McLaughlin , " who know far better than I his worth  --  his dedication to the good life , his devotion to his family , his love for his community , his pride in his church , his boundless capacity for friendship  --  . . . " Here he thought grimly of the little drunken maniac charging at him across a Chicago hotel lobby , dripping spittle on his lapels ; he added , " His sobriety . " Ile stole a glance at the widow ; on her face were the marks of the familiar struggle between pleasure and an utter bafflement . She likes the words , Skeffington thought , but  --  is this her Eddie ? He sincerely hoped not . He had often observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he . accorded the departed their last and greatest favor : he rendered them totally unrecognizable to their relicts . One could do no more . And now , while the applause continued , the word " veterinary " clicked into place . Ile had not yet mentioned this . He would do so now ; it was the next step but , more than that , it was the way to the exit for Eddie McLaughlin . " And we must n't forget , of course , the connection that existed between his splendid profession and his life . Eddie McLaughlin devoted his adult life towards helping those dumb friends of man who are unable to complain of their ills . I think it altogetherprobable that the many hours spent in their service  --  in the relief of the suffering of the helpless dog , the cat , the numberlessother household pets who give companionship to so many of us  --  fortified his own humanitarian inclinations . They left him even more resolute in the pursuit of those noble ends to which every Legionnaire aspires .... " He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Already he had formed the phrases of transition which would take him from the memory of Eddie McLauglin back to the land of the living and , specifically , back to the fact of his own campaign . For although his memory was perhaps less effective than it had been in his younger days , he never came close to forgetting that he was running for public office . Accordingly he switched adroitly to Eddie McLaughlin , Political Man .. . ... Not actively engaged in the political arena itself , perhaps , but a lifelong and respected Democrat all the same . As such , he was profoundly concerned with the problems of the poor and underprivileged of our community . This is a noble concern , but I regret to say that it 's not a universal one . I doubt very much if our good friends of the Republican party share in it to any great extent . Possibly a few of the shabbier members may ; I 've noticed that as soon as they get a bit down on their luck , they 're apt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironic insertion , accompanied by the familiar deadpan stare , had the desired effect . There were smiles and there was laughter ; the change of tone had been establishd ; this was what most of them had come to hear . For one moment , - 125 - Skeffington felt the old impish temptation to shock : to tell , in this instance , a story of the departed veterinary having been called in to attend the cat of a wealthy Republican , and of havingfound it in a state of advanced malnutrition due to its owner having made inroads on the catmeat . But he resisted ; such invention , in the presence of the widow , would be in questionabletaste , and would , moreover , serve to reintroduce the name of Eddie McLaughlin . " Still , we must remember that shabby Republicans are few and far between , " he said . " The few there are , are carefully concealedfrom public view : they 're smuggled around the city in the luggage compartments of Cadillacs . Most Republicans , however , do n't even like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I remember some years ago when I proposed building the public baths along the Strandway ; I was greeted with a chorus of recriminations from the opposition party . They had a terrifying vision : hundreds of the poor would now be able to take baths regularly ! For their part , they want our poor to be like Frenchwomen . A Frenchwoman , as you know , takes a bath but twice in her life : once when she enters it , and once when she leaves it . In between times she uses talcum powder . It 's a well-known fact that the Republicans have a vested interest in the talcum powder industry ! " It was the kind of outrageous statement which his audiences expectedfrom him and loved when they got . Everyone was now cheering and laughing , the spirit of the eulogy left far behind ; even the widow , Skeffington noted , was smiling : there was at least the implication that her Eddie had had some share in the building of the poor man 's bathtub . He kept on in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidarity in the face of the Republican threat . A threat so grave in this city , he reflected sardonically , that for the last twenty years they have n't even bothered to field a candidate . Still , one had to proceed to the goal by the well-established routes of tradition ; one flogged the Republican foe in order better to lacerate the opposition within one 's own fold . He came , in this manner , to the focal point of the Eddie McLaughlin Memorial Dinner : the candidacy of Frank Skeffington.  --  126  --  .. Successful opposition to this slumbering giant of power and privilege must depend upon a united party , under experiencedand proved leadership . I ca n't help thinking in this connection of the names of some of those who apparently aspire to lead us in this fight . I think of these names with some difficulty , to be sure , as until quite recently I never heard them mentioned . I 'm sure they 're all fine men , good citizens , cleanlivingpeople who 've never been to jail and who support their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the question nobody can answer because nobody knows . Can they run a city ? Nobody knows that either . It seems to me that something new has been introduced into political campaigning : the voter is being asked to cast his ballot for the Great Unknown  --  and maybe not so great at that . It 's a little like selecting the Unknown Soldier to be a general . He 's a fine chap and everybody honors him , but who is he , and what does he know about commanding an army ? I think most of us would prefer to trust our sons to those of proven ability . In the same way , we would prefer to trust ourselves and our city to those who at least have demonstratedcapacity to take care of it ... . In the next few moments he made it quite clear that the list of candidates so qualified was not limitless ; that it included , in fact , but a single name . The point made , he did not dwell upon it . It was a reminder ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often . He mentioned , briefly , entertainingly , and with shrewd selectiveness , some of his political accomplishments ; he mentioned them almost by the way , and that was enough . Then , his mission accomplished , he returned for the final token nod at the peg from which all things had been made to hang . He returned to Eddie McLaughlin . " But we have strayed far afield , " he said . His voice was faintly reproachful ; it was as if he were gently chiding the audience for having led him into talking about himself . His heavy features assumed the mask of full solemnity that had marked the openingmoments of his address . " In our zeal to urge upon you the necessity for experienced leadership in these troubled times , we may seem to have forgotten the primary purpose of our being here tonight . I assure you that nothing could be farther from- 127 - the truth . What we 've been talking about concerns the care of the underprivileged , the responsibilities of the good citizen , the proper administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we are all so proud . I think we 're agreed that no man among us was more aware of these problems than Eddie Mcl.aughlin , and that no man gave more unsparingly of his energiesfor their solution . So then , to discuss these issues is , in the larger sense , to discuss Eddie McLaughlin and to realize more fully the measure of his accomplishment . It was a great accomplishmentindeed , and tonight as we who are gathered here think of that accomplishment and of the generous , courageous man behind it , we 're certain in our hearts that Eddie McLaughlin has long since gained his reward . We know , each and every one of us , that to his ears must surely have come those blessed words which he was born to hear : ' Well done , Eddie McLaughlin ! Well done , thou good and faithful servant ! ' " He inclined his head slightly in a gesture coincident with the ecclesiastical flavor of the concluding words ; in the audience a slight reverential pause obtained , and then the room rocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it meant little , for the crowd had been overwhelmingly in his favor to begin with . A flick of an eye revealed that the widow had joined in the spirit of the moment ; she was smiling at him and applauding . He smiled back ; she seemed a pleasant woman , far too pleasant , surely , to have been saddled with the wretched little nuisance whom he had just commended so highly . The universallyfavorable reception continued to ring agreeably in his ears ; although he gave it no special significance , it did seem a good omen : an auspicious beginning for a grand campaign . Success to be launched upon the bony shoulders of the deceased Eddie McLaughlin . He did not sit down again ; instead , as there was still much to do , he made his way from the head table to the nearest exit , surrounded by the same vocal congratulatory cordon that had escorted him into the hall . They saw him out into the corridor ; they stayed with him in the descending elevator ; they walked with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door of his waiting car . It was not until the car pulled away  --  128  --  from the curb that he was able to separate himself from them with a final wave . Once again he was able to relax against the cushions , flanked now by Weinberg and Ditto . " A good talk , " Weinberg said approvingly . " Right on the ball . " " Adequate , Sam , adequate , " he said . " Eddie dead served us far better than Eddie living , that 's sure . " " That was a very grand speech , Governor , " Ditto said . " One of the very best I 've ever heard you give on such an occasion . " Inspiredby the eloquence he had so recently attended , he said feelingly , " And I 'm sure that the very same man in question you spoke in favor of tonight must be looking down on us right now and feeling proud of himself ! " " A sentiment like that does you credit , Ditto , " Skeffington said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely thoughts . There 's only one thing wrong and that 's your sense of direction . I doubt very much that he 's looking down on us tonight ; I have a feeling that from where the good Eddie is , it 's a hell of a long look up . " He leaned towards the front seat and said to his chauffeur , " Pick it up a bit , Charlie . We have a lot of work to do before we go to bed .... " Four hours later , Skeffington was in his home and in his bed . He had spoken at three more dinners following the one for Eddie McLaughlin , and he had gone to the dance given by John Gorman . Here he had conversed with Camarrata , and the memory of that conversation now caused him to smile , then to chuckle aloud . Shifting his position under the single lightweight blanket  --  for the August night was seasonably warm  --  he said softly , " Return to Sorrento , old friend Camaratta . " Becauseafter this election , the Italian would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , all unwittingly , he had begun to inch forward on the terrifyingly short slide to oblivion , This was a thought which gave Skeffington some satisfaction . The day and the night had , in fact , been little else but satisfaction . From the moment of his rising until now , the sour note had been absent ; fulfillment had exceeded anticipation in every detail . Even the interview with his nephew had come off with --  129  --  out any of the small hitches which conceivably might have arisen , and this had given him the greatest satisfaction of all . The need to bring the boy into his corner by his side throughout the cam- paign had come upon him unexpectedly one day and had per- sisted ; he thought now that it stood at least a reasonable chance of being satisfied . Ile stirred once more ; his eyes closed , and , in the utter mid- night quiet of the big house , he prepared to go to sleep . He was tired . He was more tired tt an he had been in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himseh into believing that he was not . His eyes smarted , there was an ache in his legs , and he was aware of the steady pulsations within his body , pounding away just a little too hard and a little too fast . The day had been too long and too full  --  but it had been worth it . Still , he knew his age , he knew himself , and he knew that prudence required a certain sen- sible curtailment ; he would measure his activities with more care during the coming months . And now , just before sleep , he thought , as he so often did , of his wife , and wished that she had been with him today . Then , in the final seconds of his conscious day , he thought suddenly of his son , and the fact that he had not bothered to come to City Hall , as he had been requested to . Skeffington frowned , sighed , and reflected that no day , however triumphant , could escape totally without a shadow . Then he fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to his house to go to bed . He came up the stairs with a light , almost prancing step ; he was singing softly to himself . He had been drinking , but he was not drunk . He had been drinking only enough to be happy , for he liked to be happy . Nearing the top of the stairs , he was singing an old favorite , in a new and unfamiliar rhythm . It was " Whose Honey Are You ? " as done in the manner of Fats Citronella , the original words shot through with the primitive musical cries and grunts which had shot that gifted entertainer into fame . " Whose honey are you ? Rootie va va vovity vop.  --  13o  --  Whose tea do you sweeten ? Fumfy fo fo foti foop .... " He had met Fats only an hour before ; Fats had greeted him with enthusiasm . " I met ' your daddy-daddy today , boy ! " he had said , his great eyes beaming . " Reet ! He gim me one of them real gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed agreeably . " Crazy crazy ! Root ! " he had said , right back . And then they had " all laughed uproariously : Fats and Junior and Junior 's blond girl . He had liked Fats . Now , passing his father 's closed door , he suddenly remembered that he should have gone to see him earlier that day . He had been asked to do so , but , what with one thing and another , he had forgotten . He wondered if it were anything important . He hoped not ; he thought not . In any case , he had meant to go but now he would make it the next day instead . And he went to his room , still singing softly , " Whose honey are you ... ? " PART IISixTHE weeks went by . Skeffington 's campaign began to build , slowly and expertly ; in its meticulous progression nothing was left to chance . All that was to be done had been done many times before , in previous election years , and there was neither desire nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to innovation , but as an extremely successful politician he thought it unreasonable to abandon the techniques by which success had been gained . And so the campaign got under way . In these early weeks , the work was vigorous , routine , and  --  to the layman 's eye  --  imperceptible . There were no great rallies , no mass meetings , no radio or television addresses ; the time had not yet come for the visible , sustained bid to the electorate . It was a time of subsurface maneuvering , of putting the house in order . There were daily conferences between Skeffington and his chief lieutenants , regular meetings with the ward and precinctleaders , there was the careful outlining of strategy , and there was the establishing and renovating of the multiple connectivelines with which each single city block was bound to City Hall . Over all this preparation , Skeffington himself exercised a close and unbroken supervision . The labor was long , detailed and unexciting ; he did not mind . He knew that someone had to do it ; he knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subordinates ; he knew , too , that in the final analysis it was all being done for him . This last consideration was one which occurred to him rather often ; he found that it helped remarkably to preserve him from boredom or fatigue . More than three weeks had gone by since the meeting between uncle and nephew in City Hall , and despite Adam 's declaration of interest and commitment , the visit had not been repeated . The  --  135  --  campaign might move onward and upward ; so far , Adam had not moved with it . There were several reasons for this . The first was that Adam had re-examined his uncle 's words and had found that , as always , they had been lent an extraordinary persuasivenessby his presence ; considered later , in the cool reasonable shade of his absence , they were less compelling . They were by no means unconvincing : Adam was willing to believe that by following the campaign along the lines suggested by Skeffington he would come to know better both this man who had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steadily increasinginterest . But what he did not now quite believe was that he could follow it unimplicated : the ringside seat which Skeffingtonhad spoken of was all very well , but only if one could be sure of not falling into the ring . It was this certainty which Adam now lacked . His old distaste for becoming in any way involved in the subtle , incomprehensible machinery of politics began powerfully to reassert itself ; he began to regret his promise to his uncle ; he even started to wonder if , really , it had been a promise after all . Moreover , there was Maeve . Eventually she would have to be told ; it was an inevitable step which Adam contemplated withoutenthusiasm . Ordinarily the currents of his marriage flowed smoothly , almost ideally ; the give-and-take between husband and wife was accomplished with a minimum of friction . Maeve was intelligent , she was adaptable ; more to the point , perhaps , she was tactfully deferential to her husband 's opinions . It was only that there were certain subjects from which could spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing no apparent relation to each other , were actually connected by the most infrangible of ties : they were the subjects upon which Maeve sought counsel from her father . The subject of Skeffington was chief among them . Adam was not vindictive , but when he thought of his father= in-law it was almost with a grim wistfulness and a sense of regret that the problems of life did not lend themselves to the ready solution of those of art . How wonderful it would be , he thought , if his father-in-law could be treated with the ruthless , imaginative dispatch now reserved for the fictive enemies of  --  136  --  Little Simp ! But this was only a dream . Roger Sugrue remained alive and mercilessly active , an untouchable oracle working away ceaselessly in the background , muttering , one after another , his incendiary platitudes . He was not a bad man , but he was worse : he was a self-made one . He had begun with nothing ; he had put himself through Harvard ; he had , in time , gained control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this exotic world of the chemise and the living-tissue girdle he secured annually a handsome income . Success among the undergarments had given him confidence , and he had begun to speak with authority on matters of graver concern : politics , life , religion . As an amateur theologian he had acquired the passion for nosing about through diocesan affairs which sometimes afflicts the well-to-do Catholic layman . Independently and unrequested , he called upon priests and their parishes ; he conducted surveys ; he investigatedsources of strife and dispute ; he passed his findings and his advice on to his ecclesiastical superiors , who received both with an increasingly ill-concealed reluctance . Skeffington had once spoken of this to Adam . " The higher clergy in this diocese , " he had said , " made the great mistake in the beginning of regarding your father-in-law as an ordinary pest . He is no such thing . He 's a one-man plague . There they were , letting him putter around just like any ordinaryrun-of-the-mill nuisance with a couple of hundred thousand dollars that he 's got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he was chewing them up like a corn borer in a field of Golden Bantam . Poor Monsignor Flannery lived all his life in the diocese and his one wish was that he could spend his declining days in the parish he was born in . He would have made it , too , but he had the misfortune to be introduced to your father-in-law ; six months later , at the age of eighty , he was clawing at the Cardinal 's door , pleading for an assignment to the Foreign Missions . My heart went out to him ; I 've known your father-in-law a long time . " The Monsignor may or may not have been an apocryphal figure ; Adam felt for him anyway . He too had known his fatherin-lawfor some time ; acquaintance had not bred affection . Only the preceding week he had gone with Maeve to Roger 's home for  --  137  --  dinner . After the meal they had gone into the library ; there Roger sat and talked : a stocky , bald , verbose man of fifty-five who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crimson smoking jacket with the Harvard seal on the left breast pocket . Ile was proud of his alma mater , so proud , indeed , that he had almost forgotten his misery as an undergraduate : the poor Iris ! - boy on the make , socially and financially ambitious , forever subject to handicaps of poverty and the fact of being a representative of a race which had produced the young usurper , Skeffington . There had been sneers , an almost perpetual chill ; Roger had never forgiven Skeffington for them . But now , long an alumnus , he had forgiven the college . The fact of his attendance had given him cachet ; more , he reasoned that the secular aca- demic background lent him additional distinction as a Catholic . It was a kind of proof of his Faith : he had been exposed to error , he had emerged intact . He was grateful to his school for having failed to defeat him . On the night of the recent dinner the conversation for the most part had been devoted to the improbable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unearthing . One of the younger priests of the diocese , it appeared , had taken time out from his parish duties to enter and to win a country-club golf tournament . The simple triumph had fired him with ambition , and he had aspired to greater things . " Why , he actually went to his pastor , " Roger had said indig- nantly , " and asked if there was any provision in Canon Law to stop him from entering the qualifying rounds of the National Amateur Golf Championship ! Imagine that if you will for a moment ! A priest ordained for only two years , and wanting to be the golfing champion of the United States ! " Adam had departed from his usual practice of monosyllabic response ; he had said , " I could n't agree with you more . The danger of scandal is obvious . He must have had very little ex- perience in actual competitive play ; we would have no guarantee that he would win so much as a hole . He could be trounced by anyone : a Baptist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a glance that was at once warning and plea ; his father-in-law , who , surprisingly , had for once listened  --  138  --  to what had been said to him , added tolerantly , " No no , Adam , you 're missing the whole point . I was afraid you might . The point is that it 's not a suitable ambition . Ask yourself this question : Where 's the strength of vocation there ? . . . I intend to take it up with his bishop . " He had talked , that night , only briefly of Skeffington . " He 's overreached himself this time . He 's gone too far , and at last he 's been caught . Now I do n't say this gloatingly . I hope I 'm big enough not to seek revenge , or to wish any man hard luck , no matter how rascally he may have been in his public life . And of course , Adam , there 's nothing at all personal in this . But the point is that Skeffington is running up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influence in certain financial circles , as you know , and I heard only the other day on the very best authority  --  from Harvey Willet , who is Norman Cass 's right-hand man  --  that the banks have refused point-blank to grant the city a loan under his administration . Well , you may say , that 's not everything . And I say , " he said , coming happily to what really mattered , " I say that it 's something , and that something is the beginning of the end .... " It was Maeve who , in hasty diplomacy , had turned the tide , by diverting her father into the path of autobiography . The possibility of conflict between these two men worried her deeply ; she loved her husband , she worshipped her father . It was theblind spot in her which Adam could forgive but could not understand . Roger was the only parent she had ever known ; as hehimself said , rather often and rather sentimentally , he had beenboth father and mother to her . It was a claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved him , respectedhim , and was proud of his achievement . And sometimes , in theirinfrequent arguments , Adam seemed to see mirrored in theyoung and lovely woman he had married the urgent , opinionatedfigure of her father , spurring her on to disputation , remindingher not to let her 1 are nt down . This did not happen often ; itwas a condition which he thought that time or  --  more doubtfully  --  the demise of Roger would take care of . But he knew thatif he told Maeve of his conversation with Skeffington and his resultantpromise , she would be hurt , she would be angry , she would ,  --  ' 39  --
