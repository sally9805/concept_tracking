In the halls of Chicago 's Sherman Hotel , the 5,000 well-brushed , neatly tailored conventioneers looked as if they might have turned out for the annual convention of Kiwanis International . They were members of the solidest and biggest ( 1,623,222 families ) farm organization in the U.S. , the American Farm Bureau Federation . As expected , they talked mostly about one subject : the price problem back home . But what they said was quite different from what many politicians have been saying for them . <P> " My income is down 25% or 30% from last year , " said Vernon McLeod , 33 , who raises hogs , cattle , corn , wheat and oats on his 390 acres near Lyons , Mich . " But I 'm not for 90% of parity . I 'm for flexibility , something as close to supply and demand as you can get . I do n't like artificial situations . " Said Harold Umbaugh , 42 , who has chickens , corn , wheat , oats , soybeans and hay on his 195 acres at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to be on the dole . We like to make our own decisions . We ought to use price supports like brakes on a car , for emergencies . " <P> Promissory Disaster . On the convention floor , the tone of the lobby talk was faithfully preserved . As their 163 voting delegates , Farm Bureau members had sent mostly stable , successful farmers in their late 40s or beyond , who have plowed and planted through the depths of depression and the peaks of prosperity . Their keynoter was Farm Bureau President Charles Baker Shuman , a corn , cattle and soybean farmer from Sullivan , Ill . Shuman complained that farmers have been caught in " a serious cost-price squeeze , " but went on to praise U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson as " a very conscientious man who is doing as good as any man in his job can do under the circumstances . " <P> Farmer Shuman blamed the old 90%-support program for producing trouble some surpluses , read a lecture to the politicians : " It is not only dangerous from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of support , but I think it would be disastrous to the party that gets in power . The party committed to high , fixed supports would feel obligated to put them into effect , and that would result in farm income going down and surpluses continuing to accumulate . " <P> From its resolutions committee , the convention got a proposal to reaffirm last year 's stand in favor of Ezra Benson 's flexible-support program . There was a lively but short-lived flurry of opposition from some Southern delegations , who wanted cotton , tobacco , wheat , rice and peanuts supported at a rigid 90% of parity . The vote was 124-39 for flexibility . Drawled E. H. Agnew , South Carolina cotton farmer who had helped lead the defeated Southerners : " It 's like being a bastard at a family reunion and a skunk at a wedding reception . "
