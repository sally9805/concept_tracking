txt The House Ways and Means Committee , dealing a major new blow to President Truman 's tax program , rejected today the Administration 's recommendations for reducing special tax allowances available to producers of oil , gas and other minerals . Going a step further , the taxframing group voted to make several additional mining operations eligible for such benefits . The tentative decisions , if written into law , would result in annual revenue losses estimated at $15,000,000 to $20,000,000 . The President 's proposals entailed increases of $200,000,000 . Earlier in the day the committee approved a reduction to 2 per cent of the 6 per cent interest rate now paid by the Treasury in refunding overpaid taxes . This would eventually result in estimated savings to the Government of about $67,000,000 annually . The committee 's action on allowances for mining operators raised new fears that the tax-adjustment bill it is currently drafting would run into a veto by President Truman . He has served notice that he ' will not sign any measure entailing a net loss of revenue . In the voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,000,000,000 of excise tax reductions but has acted to provide only a fraction of that amount in offsetting revenues . Reduction of the mining allowances wad proposed by the Administration as the principal item , and the one calculated to produce the greatest revenue , in its list of recommendations for closing Revenue Code " loopholes " to offset excise tax reductions . All of its other loophole-closing proposals combined would produce less than $400,000,000 of new revenue . The special mining allowances , regarding which supporters say that " loophole " is a misnomer , are designed to compensate operators for depletion of their mineral resources and for unproductive exploration expenses . In principle , they correspond roughly to the tax allowances for the depreciation of manufacturers ' plant and equipment . Mining operators are permitted to deduct specified percentages from their gross incomes in paying Federal income taxes . The Administration proposed these reductions : for oil and gas , from 271/a per cent to 15 per cent ; sulphur , 23 per cent to 15 per cent , and non-metallic minerals other than sulphur and coal , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Pleas Rejected In refusing to approve the reductions , the committee also rejected the recommendations of Colin F. Stam , chief of its staff of tax experts , who supported the Administration proposals . The committee then went on to approve depletion allowances of 15 per cent on fuller 's earth , refractory clays , quartzite , perlite and diatomaceous earth and 5 per cent on sand , gravel , marble and granite . By a narrow margin , it rejected a proposal by Representative John A. Carroll , Democrat of Colorado , to increase the 15 per cent allowance on metals to 271 , : ; per cent . The Administration had recommended no change in the metals alowance , but one argument for decreasing the oil and gas allowance to 15 per tent was to " equate " it with that on metals . Mr. Carroll sought equalization by raising the mineral allowance , once the committee had refused to accomplish : he result by reducing the oil and ; . as allowance . In voting to reduce the interest rate paid in connection ? with tax refunds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interest charged to tax delinquents. , This would remain at 6 per cent . ) The 2 per cent rate on refunds would take effect upon enactment of the tax-adjustment bill now being framed . The existing 6 per cent rate would still apply on the period between the date of overpayment and the date of the bill 's enactment . One argument for the cut was that some taxpayers had been deliberately overpaying their taxes as a means of obtaining a high interest return on what amounted to a foolproof investment . Prior to today 's actions , the committee had cast aside major parts of President Truman 's tax program by refusing to increase gift and estate taxes and approving excise tax reductions to the extent of more than $400,000,000 above the limit urged by the Administration . Administration supporters said today 's and yesterday 's actions were " made to order " for the writing of a veto message that would gain popular support . By yesterday 's vote to reduce the maximum tax rate on longterm capital gains , the committee left itself open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculators while failing to help the small taxpayer , it was I said . The present 25 per cent , maximum rate would be reduced to 16 per cent under the committe-approved proposal . Sponsors contended that the effect would be to increase Federal revenues by stimulating investments . The Treasury was reported to have advised committee members today , however , that the actual result would be to reduce tax collections by $150,000,000 to $175 , - 000,000 annually . If that is true , the committee so far has tentatively approved tax cuts of about $1,260,000,000 and acted to provide offsetting revenue to the extent of about $230,000,000.
