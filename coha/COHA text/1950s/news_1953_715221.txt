txt WASHINGTON , Jan. 26 ? The Atomic Energy Commission annouhced today that it would start a new series of tests of " new and improved nuclear devices " in March at its huge proving ground in the wastelands near Las Vegas , Nev . As in the Nevada tests a year ago , men of the Army , Navy , Air Force and Marine Corps will maneuver in the area to familiarize themselves with the capabilities of atomic weapons . Eighteen thousand will participate . The commission also announced plans for the construction of a $29,000,000 plant for the assembly and " processing " of explosives on the Spoon River , eighteen miles east of Macomb , Ill . The precise function of the plant was not explained except that it would not produce radioactive materials , and a commission spokesman said such materials would not even be handled on the ** tract , Speculation on the new series of desert tests centered on the possibility that the Army finally might have developed an atomic shell for its atomic cannon and would fire it during the experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such atomic artillery , have indicated in the past that a shell had not yet been constructed . Whether it has been held up because of technical reasons or because the high planners were not convinced of the practicability of atomic artillery has not been made clear . The Army has talked enthusiastically about how its 280-min , selfpropelled cannon could deliver shells accurately in a battle area in all types of weather . Air Force partisans have countered that , with the development of all-weather aircraft , the flying service could conContinued otyrogo16 , ( kdoton.5 NUCLEAR TESTS SET FOR ' NEW ' DEVICES // tinue to handle the delivery of atomic weapons in any situation . The commission said that the new tests were " designed to advance development of new and im-1 proved nuclear devices and will provide additional weapons per formance data essential to military , and civil defense effect studies .

Bomb News Becomes Issue President Truman 's guarded statement in his last State of the Union Message earlier this month on the continued development of such weapons was widely interpreted , in combination with other known facts , to have meant that a hydrogen bomb had been exploded at last year 's Eniwetok tests . The extent of the release of in- ' I formation about the hydrogen , bomb is authoritatively reported to , have caused a sharp disagreement among members of Mr. Truman 's Cabinet in the final weeks of the ) ' Democratic Administration . During the two years the Las Vegas desert range has been used for experiments , twenty atomic explosions of varying types have been set off there . Eight occurred at last spring 's tests . The Atomic Energy Commission has emphasized that each new test does not necessarily mean some marked or sensational forward step in the development of atomic products but that , as work progresses , the firing of weapons becomes necessary before research can continue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue secondary projects in atomic energy , such as the effects of radiation .

A commission spokesman would not elaborate on the role of the Spoon River project , which will be started this spring . When asked about the emphasis on explosives in the commission 's announcement , he declared that the plant would handle " more or less conventional explosives . " Since it is not the commission 's function to deal with conventional weapons , it was assumed that , the " conventional " explosives must fulfill some function in combina- ' lion with atomic materials . The Spoon River tract is Government-owned land and has been largely used by the Air Force , , which is relinquishing the property . It was the site of Camp Ellis ' in the war .
