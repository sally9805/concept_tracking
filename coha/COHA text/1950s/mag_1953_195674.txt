Nothing has been dearer to the surgeon 's heart than the dream of a machine to replace the heart-by pumping a patient 's blood during an operation . To be thoroughly effective , it must also do the work of the lungs and oxygenate the blood . Only with such equipment could the surgeon perform delicate operations with the heart in his hand , in full view , and with no blood flowing through it . Last week Philadelphia 's Dr. John H. Gibbon Jr . made the dream a reality . <P> His patient , Cecelia Bavolek , 18 , a freshman at Wilkes College in Wilkes-Barre , Pa. , was not yet born when Dr. Gibbon began the painstaking job of designing and testing equipment which ultimately led to last week 's historic operation . Cecelia had a heart murmur which got worse . Her trouble was diagnosed as a hole in the wall between the two upper quarters ( auricles ) of her heart . Each minute this caused several quarts of blood returning from her lungs to be promptly shunted back there , wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Added . When Cecelia was in high school , Dr. Gibbon had brought his machine along to the point where the heart part worked fine on dogs . But he was still not ready to try it on a human patient ( TIME , Sept. 26 , 1949 ) . Then Detroit researchers described a machine which had done part of the work of a man 's heart , but not his lungs ( TIME , Oct. 27 ) . <P> By last week Dr. Gibbon was satisfied at last with both the heart and lung sections of his machine . At Philadelphia 's Jefferson Hospital , Cecelia Bavolek was anesthetized and Dr. Gibbon , with two assisting surgeons , laid bare her heart . They opened the two large veins carrying blood to it , and slipped in plastic tubes which drained the blood away to the artificial heart-lung . There , one pump drew in the blood . Another speeded it to an oxygen chamber , where it flowed over a set of metal grids like the plates in a storage battery . Electronic controls kept the flow rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon dioxide taken away . in exact amounts , and even kept the blood at the proper degree of acidity . A third pump sent the refreshed blood back into an artery above the left side of Cecelia 's heart . <P> A Look Into the Heart . Cecelia and the machine were hooked together for 45 minutes . For 26 of those minutes the machine breathed for her and pumped her blood . In that time , Dr. Gibbon lifted up her heart and opened it so that the aperture ( as big as a half-dollar ) between the auricles was in full view . He stitched that up with relative ease since he was working in a bloodless " dry field , " although Cecelia 's heart kept beating because its muscle was getting a full blood supply . Even more important , so was her brain . <P> Said Dr. Gibbon , too camera-shy to pose with the apparatus : " The machine is not a cure-all for all heart conditions . It will probably be used chiefly on patients born with a deformed heart . It ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old age . But now , for the first time , it is possible to look into the heart . It 's sort of like drying out a well to do some work at the bottom of it . " <P> <P> Her heart 's well refilled , Cecelia Bavolek was due home late this week .
