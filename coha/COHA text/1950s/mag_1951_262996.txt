Gold-Medal Sculptor James Earle Fraser was eight when it first occurred to him that it would be fun to carve things out of stone . The year was 1884 and the place was Mitchell , S. Dak . Young Fraser watched the town hunchback shaping a block of soft chalkstone into an admired popular novelty : four pillars surrounding a movable ball . The boy got some chalkstone for himself and began to carve childish versions of the things that interested him most : horses , buffaloes and Indians . <P> Long one of the most admired sculptors in the U.S. , this week James Earle Fraser , 74 , is being honored with the gold medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letter* and with a big show . Most of the work that made him famous reflects his first childhood choice of subject . The best-known Fraser sculpture of all : the Indianhead nickel , with a buffalo on the reverse , that the U.S. Treasury issued in 1913 . Until it was superseded in 1939 by the Jefferson nickel , U.S. mints stamped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian . The road from Mitchell , S. Dak. to national fame led through Chicago and Paris . In Chicago he attended the Art Institute , worked part time as an apprentice in a local sculptor 's studio . The neoclassic splendor of the Chicago World 's Fair of 1893 , with its acres of white buildings and heroic statues , fired Eraser 's desire to go to Paris : " It was the most inspiring moment possible for a young artist . " <P> At 20 he made the trip , took along his first major work of sculpture , End of the Trail , a statue of a lean Indian sitting exhausted on his rack-ribbed horse . The work won him Paris recognition , a $1,000 prize and a job as assistant to Augustus Saint-Gaudens . Since that day , End , of the Trail has become one of the best-known and most frequently reproduced pieces of sculpture ever made by an American . <P> A Rugged Likeness . With Saint-Gaudens as his master , Fraser began producing the bigger-than-life allegorical sculptures that U.S. architects like to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also developed a knack for catching a rugged likeness in stone or metal . Soon after he returned to the U.S. in 1900 , he had more commissions than he could fill . <P> Though he has been chipping and modeling steadily for over 60 years , and Fraser allegories and heroes stand in conspicuous spots all over the U.S. , + Sculptor Fraser still has a hard time keeping up with his commissions , figures he is now about two years behind in his work . A big Fraser project just completed : two 18-ft. winged horses of bronze , flanked by symbolic figures representing The Peaceful Arts . The statues , cast and gilded in Italy last year , were paid for by the Italian government as a gesture of friendship to the U.S. Sometime this summer , they will be installed on the approach to Washington 's Arlington Memorial Bridge .
