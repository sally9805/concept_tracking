Dear Mr. Secretary General : <P> I consider it necessary to inform you that , in accordance with established procedure , I am assuming the presidency of the Security Council in August ... I request you to arrange to notify the members of the Security Council regarding the date of the meeting . The agenda will be communicated subsequently . <P> With respect , <P> Y. Malik <P> Big , blond Yakov Malik did not wait to send the letter . A Soviet second secretary telephoned from Manhattan to Trygve Lie 's office and read it in Russian . Thus the Soviet Union ended its boycott of the United Nations Security Council . <P> Last January , Malik had walked out of the Council when Dr. Tingfu F. Tsiang of Nationalist China took the chair . Said Malik then : " I object to any ruling emanating from a person who represents nobody . . . This is not a meeting , but a parody of a meeting . " <P> Thereafter the Security Council had carried on without Yakov Malik . The Russian 's absence was important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resolution calling on the U.S. and other United Nations to send troops to Korea . <P> No one knew what the month of Yakov Malik 's presidency of the Security Council would bring-willful obstruction , phony peace moves , or what . But the day before the Council was due to meet , he gave notice that first on the order of business would be the question of Red China 's admission to the U.N . Malik and his superiors in the Kremlin were picking up just where they had left off 6 months ago .
