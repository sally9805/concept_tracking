txt After the Treasury early this fall offered the public some 5% notes and found them heavily -over-subscribed , there was perhaps a natural tendency to relax and think the fiscal battle won . After all , had not the " magic fives " showed their power ? The magic fives had indeed shown two very significant things . One was that interest rates still retain their power over the flow of savings and other capital funds . The other was that there is still a large body of capital funds in this country which the Government can tap , if it is willing to pay the price . The Government can meet its obligations , even as big as they are , without having to resort to manufactured money . For proving to the skeptical what ought to have been obvious , Secretary of the Treasury Anderson deserves some sort of an accolade for political courage . But now he , and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Martin . also deserve another award for commonsense in reminding us that winning a skirmish is not the same thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Senate-House Economic Committee that one issue of 5cc short-term notes is not so magical as to end the necessity for abolishing the present interest-rate ceiling on longer term Government bonds . Mr. Martin told the same group that resorting again to gimmicks ? such as using the Federal Reserve System to support bond prices  --  would simply postpone the necessity at the cost of " serious inflationary consequences . " The truth of the matter , it seems to us , is that the magic fives have pointed up the difficulties of financing the Treasury 's deficit wholly in the shortterm market as well as showing up the efficacy of interest rates as a weapon in the fiscal L ttle . The Treasury 's 5 " short-term notes were considered so successful because they drew on " real " savings of people rather than on newly-minted bank credit . Yet the very fact that they were " real " savings meant that people were Withdrawing funds from building and can associations , from sat ings banks Ind from the temporary cash balances if business . The supply of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced . Now to some extent , of course , this happens whenever the Treasury borrows real savings , whether long term or short term . But when the Treasury confines itself solely to the short-term money market , the unwanted side effects are intensified . The whole pressure of the billions of dollars which the Treasury requires is concentrated on just one part of the money market . One result of this pressure is to drive up short-term interest rates higher than they would be if more of the Treasury 's billions were long-term bonds . The pains of this are felt acutely on the economic segment that borrows short-term money , as for Inventories , to conduct day-to-day business . Another result is to almost assure that the pains will get worse as business activity advances and private borrowers seek new funds for inventories and new equipment . If the companies must borrow , they will find themselves competing with the Treasury for the available short-term money . If they can rely on their own reserves , they will be selling their holdings of short-term governments to raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term money market will increase . So as a practical matter the Treasury ca n't raise all the necessary money , running into billions , by relying solely on the real money available for short-term lending . It must have the authority to pay the necessary interest rate to tap the long term market also , thus spreading the inevitable pressure from the huge debt . In short , the Treasury 's troubles are not yet over , for all that a skirmish has been won . The steel strike . while temporarily reducing other demands for short-term money , is also reducing tax revenues . This means the Treasury will need more new money next year than anticipated , just at a time when reviving steel mills may increase short-term money demands from business generally . Nor will the Treasury 's troubles he ended by any kind of easy magic . But e can hope that Congress will hate learned something from the successful tactics in the skirmish and give the Treasury the interest-rate weapons it needs to win the battle .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
