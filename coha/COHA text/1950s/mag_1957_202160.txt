THE TAXIS OF THE MARNE , ( 244 pp. ) - Jean Dutourd-Simon &; Schuster ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> France is the Sick Woman of Europe . Diagnoses of her ailments are plentiful , with blame falling on practically anything , including the parliamentary system , the Gallic spirit , absinthe , existentialism , contraceptives , conservatism , radicalism , modern art , the unreasonable insistence on reason , the undigested principles of the French Revolution . Brilliant Satirist Jean Dutourd ( A Dog 's Head , The Best Butter ) will have little to do with any of these explanations . He refuses to see history in terms of abstract ideas , cycles or forces . He sees it in terms of men-weak or strong , good or bad . wise or stupid , to be judged by such quaint values as honor and courage , dishonor and cowardice . <P> For months the taunt as well as the talk of Paris , Dutourd 's book does not explain anything-it merely accuses . Zola himself might have been proud of its polemic passion ; few Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cry from the heart of an enraged patriot . On Dutourd 's lips , the famed French proverb becomes : " To understand all is to forgive nothing . " <P> Cockroaches &; Poltroons . In June 1940 Jean Dutourd was 20 , and for all of two weeks a pseudo soldier in a pseudo army in a pseudo fight . He and his fellow soldiers had a shrugging attitude of callow " realism , " which is " a polite translation of the word cowardice . " He describes how after the German breakthrough he and five buddies wandered around Brittany like truant schoolboys , cadging six meals a day from the peasants , who treated them as heroes . Only one farmer told them off : " Get out ! If you had fought , you 'd be fed now instead of having to beg ! " <P> What had happened to France since the days in 1914 , when the Germans also threatened a breakthrough and 6,000 reinforcements were rushed in hastily commandeered Paris taxicabs to the Marne , where they helped to stem the Boche tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stupid and the men did not want to be killed . " From Commander in Chief Gamelin down , with the honorable exception of De Gaulle ( " one great soul " ) , the generals were " doddering numskulls. " " cockroaches , " " poltroons . " They " had the instruments of victory in their hands . What nobody realized was this : they were longing to change their profession . They did not like war . . . Their real inclination was for quieter occupation : accountant , postmaster , colonial administrator . . . The damned scoundrels ! " <P> Dutourd soon found himself imprisoned in a vast aircraft hangar , along with 8,000 other Frenchmen who lolled about admiring the conquering Germans for their elegance , and green with envy of their boots . ( In a devastating aside , Dutourd suggests that the money poured into the Maginot Line might better have been spent on boots for the French army . ) It was assumed that the war was nearly over , that the Germans would send the prisoners home on free railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his three-year stint with the Resistance to the point of devoting half a sentence to it .
