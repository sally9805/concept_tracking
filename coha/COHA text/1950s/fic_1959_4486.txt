CUM GRANO SALIS . BY DAVID GORDON Illustrated by Emsh Just because a man can do something others ca n't does not , unfortunately , mean he knows how to do it . One man could eat the native fruit and live ... but how ? " And that , " said Colonel Fennister glumly , " appears to be that . " The pile of glowing coals that had been Storage Shed Number One was still sending up tongues of flame , but they were nothing compared with what they 'd been half an hour before . " The smoke smells good , anyway , " said Major Grodski , sniffing appreciatively . The colonel turned his head and glowered at his adjutant . " There are times , Grodski , when your sense of humor is out of place . " " Yes , sir , " said the major , still sniffing . " Funny thing for lightning to do , though . Sort of a dirty trick , you might say . " " You might , " growled the colonel . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankful that the Twentieth Century predictions of skin-tight uniforms for the Space Service had never come true . He had round , pleasant , blue eyes , a rather largish nose , and a rumbling basso voice that was a little surprising the first time you heard it , but which seemed to fit perfectly after you knew him better . Right at the moment , he was filing data and recommendations in his memory , where they would be instantly available for use when he needed them . Not in a physical file , but in his own mind . All right , Colonel Fennister , he thought to himself , just what does this mean  --  to me ? And to the rest ? The Space Service was not old . Unlike the Air Service , the Land Service , or the Sea Service , it did not have centuries or tradition behind it . But it had something else . It had something that none of the other Services had  --  Potential . In his own mind , Colonel Fennister spelled the word with an upper case P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to him , a more potent word than any other in the Universe . Potential . Potential ! Illustration Because the Space Service of the United Earth had more potential than any other Service on Earth . How many seas were there for the Sea Service to sail ? How much land could the Land Service march over ? How many atmospheres were there for the Air Service to conquer ? Not for any of those questions was there an accurate answer , but for each of those questions , the answer had a limit . But how much space was there for the Space Service to conquer ? Colonel Fennister was not a proud man . He was not an arrogant man . But he did have a sense of destiny ; he did have a feeling that the human race was going somewhere , and he did not intend that that feeling should become totally lost to humanity . Potential . Definition : Potential ; that which has a possibility of coming into existence . No , more than that . That which has a  --  * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thoughts which had crowded into his forebrain . What were the chances that the first expedition to Alphegar IV would succeed ? What were the chances that it would fail ? And ( Fennister grinned grimly to himself ) what good did it do to calculate chances after the event had happened ? Surrounding the compound had been a double-ply , heavy-gauge , woven fence . It was guaranteed to be able to stop a diplodocus in full charge ; the electric potential ( potential ! That word again ! ) great enough to carbonize anything smaller than a blue whale . No animal on Alphegar IV could possibly get through it . And none had . Trouble was , no one had thought of being attacked by something immensely greater than a blue whale , especially since there was no animal larger than a small rhino on the whole planet . Who , after all , could have expected an attack by a blind , uncaring colossus  --  a monster that had already been dying before it made its attack ? Because no one had thought of the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even the amperage difference between the low-hanging clouds and the ground below  --  was immensely greater than that of Earth , that had already been determined . But the compound and the defenses surrounding it had already been compensated for that factor . Who could have thought that a single lightning stroke through one of the tremendous , twelve-hundred-foot trees that surrounded the compound could have felled it ? Who could have predicted that it would topple toward the compound itself ? That it would have been burning  --  that was something that could have been guaranteed , had the idea of the original toppling been considered . Especially after the gigantic wooden life-thing had smashed across the double-ply fence , thereby adding man-made energy to its already powerful bulk and blazing surface . But  --  that it would have fallen across Storage Shed Number One ? Was that predictable ? Fennister shook his head slowly . No . It was n't . The accident was simply that  --  an accident . No one was to blame ; no one was responsible . Except Fennister . He was responsible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expedition . He was the Military Officer ; he was the Man In Charge of Fending Off Attack . And he had failed . Because that huge , blazing , stricken tree had toppled majestically down from the sky , crashing through its smaller brethren , to come to rest on Storage Shed Number One , thereby totally destroying the majority of the food supply . There were eighty-five men on Alphegar IV , and they would have to wait another six months before the relief ship came . And they did n't have food enough to make it , now that their reserve had been destroyed . Fennister growled something under his breath . " What ? " asked Major Grodski , rather surprised at his superior 's tone . " I said : ' Water , water , everywhere  --  ' , that 's what I said . " Major Grodski looked around him at the lush forest which surrounded the double-ply fence of the compound . " Yeah , " he said . " ' Nor any drop to drink . ' But I wish one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple hundred feet . " " I 'm going back to my quarters , " Fennister said . " I 'll be checking with the civilian personnel . Let me know the total damage , will you ? " The major nodded . " I 'll let you know , sir . Do n't expect good news . " " I wo n't , " said Colonel Fennister , as he turned . * * * * * The colonel let his plump bulk sag forward in his chair , and he covered his hands with his eyes . " I can imagine all kinds of catastrophes , " he said , with a kind of hysterical glumness , " but this has them all beat . " Dr. Pilar stroked his , short , gray , carefully cultivated beard . " I 'm afraid I do n't understand . We could all have been killed . " The colonel peeked one out from between the first and second fingers of his right hand . " You think starving to death is cleaner than fire ? " Pilar shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not certain that we 'll all die  --  that 's all . " Colonel Fennister dropped his hands to the surface of his metal desk . " I see , " he said dryly . " Where there 's life , there 's hope . Right ? All right , I agree with you . " He waved his hand around , in an all-encompassing gesture . " Somewhere out there , we may find food . But do n't you see that this puts us in the Siege Position ? " Dr. Francis Pilar frowned . His thick salt-and-pepper brows rumpled in a look of puzzlement . " Siege Position ? I 'm afraid  --  " Fennister gestured with one hand and leaned back in his chair , looking at the scientist across from him . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I 've let my humiliation get the better of me . " He clipped his upper lip between his teeth until his lower incisors were brushed by his crisp , military mustache , and held it there for a moment before he spoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any cerebral magnitude whatever allows himself to get into . It is as old as Mankind , and a great deal stupider . It is the position of a beleaguered group which lacks one simple essential to keep them alive until help comes . " A fighting outfit , suppose , has enough ammunition to stand off two more attacks ; but they know that there will be reinforcements within four days . Unfortunately , the enemy can attack more than twice before help comes . Help will come too late . " Or , it could be that they have enough water to last a week , but help wo n't come for a month . " You follow me , I 'm sure . The point , in so far as it concerns us , is that we have food for about a month , but we wo n't get help before six months have passed . We know help is coming , but we wo n't be alive to see it . " Then his eyes lit up in a kind of half hope . " Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could see the look in Dr. Pilar 's eyes . * * * * * Broderick MacNeil was a sick man . The medical officers of the Space Service did not agree with him in toto , but MacNeil was in a position to know more about his own state of health than the doctors , because it was , after all , he himself who was sick . Rarely , of course , did he draw the attention of the medical officers to his ever-fluctuating assortment of aches , pains , signs , symptoms , malaises , and malfunctions . After all , it would n't do for him to be released from the Service on a Medical Discharge . No , he would suffer in silence for the sake of his chosen career  --  which , apparently , was to be a permanent Spaceman 2nd Class . Broderick MacNeil had never seen his medical record , and therefore did not know that , aside from mention of the normal slight defects which every human body possesses , the only note on the records was one which said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to immerse self in job at hand . According to psych tests , he can competently handle positions up to Enlisted Space Officer 3rd Class , but positions of ESO/2 and above should be carefully considered . ( See Psych Rept . Intelligence Sectn . ) " But , if MacNeil did not know what the medics thought of him , neither did the medics know what he thought of them . Nor did they know that MacNeil carried a secret supply of his own personal palliatives , purgatives and poly-purpose pills . He kept them carefully concealed in a small section of his space locker , and had labeled them all as various vitamin mixtures , which made them seem perfectly legal , and which was not too dishonest , since many of them were vitamins . On the morning after the fire , he heaved his well-muscled bulk out of bed and scratched his scalp through the close-cropped brown hair that covered his squarish skull . He did not feel well , and that was a fact . Of course , he had been up half the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He fancied he had a bit of a headache , and his nerves seemed a little jangled . His insides were probably in their usual balky state . He sighed , wished he were in better health , and glanced around at the other members of the company as they rose grumpily from their beds . He sighed again , opened his locker , took out his depilator , and ran it quickly over his face . Then , from his assortment of bottles , he began picking over his morning dosage . Vitamins , of course ; got to keep plenty of vitamins in the system , or it goes all to pot on you . A , B1 , B2 , B12 , C , ... and on down the alphabet and past it to A-G . All-purpose mineral capsules , presumably containing every element useful to the human body and possibly a couple that were n't . Two APC capsules . ( **27;1165;TOOLONG . He liked the way those words sounded ; very medicinal . ) A milk-of-magnesia tablet , just in case . A couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( MacNeil was n't quite sure what bile was , but he was quite sure that its increased flow would work wonders within . ) A largish tablet of sodium bicarbonate to combat excess gastric acidity  --  obviously a horrible condition , whatever it was . He topped it all off with a football-shaped capsule containing Liquid Glandolene  --  " Guards the system against glandular imbalance ! "  --  and felt himself ready to face the day . At least , until breakfast . He slipped several bottles into his belt-pak after he had put on his field uniform , so that he could get at them at mealtimes , and trudged out toward the mess hall to the meager breakfast that awaited him . * * * * * " Specifically , " said Colonel Fennister , " what we want to know is : What are our chances of staying alive until the relief ship comes ? " He and most of the other officers were still groggy-eyed , having had too much to do to even get an hour 's sleep the night before . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half closed . Captains Jones and Bellwether , in charge of A and B Companies respectively , and their lieutenants , Mawkey and Yutang , all looked grim and irritable . The civilian components of the policy group looked not one whit better . Dr. Pilar had been worriedly rubbing at his face , so that his normally neat beard had begun to take on the appearance of a ruptured mohair sofa ; Dr. Petrelli , the lean , waspish chemist , was nervously trimming his fingernails with his teeth : and the M.D. , Dr. Smathers , had a hangdog expression on his pudgy face and had begun drumming his fingers in a staccato tattoo on his round belly . Dr. Pilar tapped a stack of papers that lay before him on the long table at which they were all seated . " I have Major Grodski 's report on the remaining food . There is not enough for all of us to live , even on the most extended rations . Only the strongest will survive . " Colonel Fennister scowled . " You mean to imply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is over ? The discipline of the Space Service  --  " His voice was angry , but Dr. Pilar cut him off . " It may come to fighting , colonel , but , even if perfect discipline is maintained , what I say will still be true . Some will die early , leaving more food for the remaining men . It has been a long time since anything like this has happened on Earth , but it is not unknown in the Space Service annals . " The colonel pursed his lips and kept his silence . He knew that what the biologist said was true . " The trouble is , " said Petrelli snappishly , " that we are starving in the midst of plenty . We are like men marooned in the middle of an ocean with no water ; the water is there , but it 's undrinkable . " " That 's what I wanted to get at , " said Colonel Fennister . " Is there any chance at all that we 'll find an edible plant or animal on this planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each were waiting for one of the others to speak . * * * * * All life thus far found in the galaxy had had a carbon-hydrogen-oxygen base . Nobody 'd yet found any silicon based life , although a good many organisms used the element . No one yet had found a planet with a halogen atmosphere , and , although there might be weird forms of life at the bottom of the soupy atmospheres of the methane-ammonia giants , no brave soul had ever gone down to see  --  at least , not on purpose , and no information had ever come back . But such esoteric combinations are not at all necessary for the postulation of wildly variant life forms . Earth itself was prolific in its variations ; Earthlike planets were equally inventive . Carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen , plus varying proportions of phosphorus , potassium , iodine , nitrogen , sulfur , calcium , iron , magnesium , manganese , and strontium , plus a smattering of trace elements , seem to be able to cook up all kinds of life under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other Earth-type planet in that respect . It had a plant-dominated ecology ; the land areas were covered with gigantic trees that could best be described as crosses between a California sequoia and a cycad , although such a description would have made a botanist sneer and throw up his hands . There were enough smaller animals to keep the oxygen-carbon-dioxide cycle nicely balanced , but the animals had not evolved anything larger than a rat , for some reason . Of course , the sea had evolved some pretty huge monsters , but the camp of the expedition was located a long way from the sea , so there was no worry from that quarter . At the time , however , the members of the expedition did n't know any of that information for sure . The probe teams had made spot checks and taken random samples , but it was up to the First Analytical Expedition to make sure of everything . And this much they had discovered : The plants of Alphegar IV had a nasty habit of killing test animals . * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we have n't tested every plant yet . We may come across something . " " What is it that kills the animals ? " asked young Captain Bellwether . " Poison , " said Major Grodski . Pilar ignored him . " Different things . Most of them we have n't been able to check thoroughly . We found some vines that were heavily laced with cyanide , and there were recognizable alkaloids in several of the shrubs , but most of them are not that direct . Like Earth plants , they vary from family to family ; the deadly nightshade is related to both the tobacco plant and the tomato . " He paused a moment , scratching thoughtfully at his beard . " Tell you what ; let 's go over to the lab , and I 'll show you what we 've found so far . " Colonel Fennister nodded . He was a military man , and he was n't too sure that the scientists ' explanations would be very clear , but if there was information to be had , he might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * SM/2 Broderick MacNeil kept a firm grip on his blast rifle and looked around at the surrounding jungle , meanwhile thanking whatever gods there were that he had n't been put on the fence-mending detail . Not that he objected violently to work , but he preferred to be out here in the forest just now . Breakfast had n't been exactly filling , and he was hungry . Besides , this was his pet detail , and he liked it . He had been going out with the technicians ever since the base had been finished , a couple of weeks before , and he was used to the work . The biotechnicians came out to gather specimens , and it was his job , along with four others , to guard them  --  make sure that no wild animal got them while they were going about their duties . It was a simple job , and one well suited to MacNeil 's capacities . He kept an eye on the technicians . They were working on a bush of some kind that had little thorny-looking nuts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't at all sure what they did with all those little pieces and bits , but that was none of his business , anyway . Let the brains take care of that stuff ; his job was to make sure they were n't interrupted in whatever it was they were doing . After watching the three technicians in total incomprehension for a minute or so , he turned his attention to the surrounding forest . But he was looking for a plant , not an animal . And he finally saw what he was looking for . The technicians paid him no attention . They rarely did . They had their job , and he had his . Of course , he did n't want to be caught breaking regulations , but he knew how to avoid that catastrophe . He walked casually toward the tree , as though he were only slightly interested in it . He did n't know what the name of the tree was . He 'd asked a technician once , and the tech had said that the tree did n't have any name yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing not to have a name . Hell , everything had a name . But , if they did n't want to tell him what it was , that was all right with him , too . He called it a banana-pear tree . Because that 's what the fruit reminded him of . The fruit that hung from the tree were six or eight inches long , fat in the middle , and tapering at both ends . The skin was a pale chartreuse in color , with heliotrope spots . Illustration MacNeil remembered the first time he 'd seen one , the time he 'd asked the tech what its name was . The tech had been picking some of them and putting them into plastic bags , and the faint spark of MacNeil 's dim curiosity had been brought to feebly flickering life . " Hey , Doc , " he 'd said , " whatcha gon na do with them things ? " " Take ' em to the lab , " said the technician , engrossed in his work . MacNeil had digested that carefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What for ? " The technician had sighed and popped another fruit into a bag . He had attempted to explain things to Broderick MacNeil before and given it up as a bad job . " We just feed ' em to the monkeys , Mac , that 's all . " " Oh , " said Broderick MacNeil . Well , that made sense , anyhow . Monkeys got to eat something , do n't they ? Sure . And he had gazed at the fruit in interest . Fresh fruit was something MacNeil missed . He 'd heard that fresh fruit was necessary for health , and on Earth he 'd always made sure that he had plenty of it . He did n't want to get sick . But they did n't ship fresh fruit on an interstellar expedition , and MacNeil had felt vaguely apprehensive about the lack . Now , however , his problems were solved . He knew that it was strictly against regulations to eat native fruit until the brass said so , but that did n't worry him too much . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey can , so he was n't worried about it . So he 'd tried one . It tasted fine , something like a pear and something like a banana , and different from either . It was just fine . Since then , he 'd managed to eat a couple every day , so 's to get his fresh fruit . It kept him healthy . Today , though , he needed more than just health ; he was hungry , and the banana-pears looked singularly tempting . When he reached the tree , he turned casually around to see if any of the others were watching . They were n't , but he kept his eye on them while he picked several of the fruit . Then he turned carefully around , and , with his back to the others , masking his movements with his own body , he began to munch contentedly on the crisp flesh of the banana-pears. * * * * * " Now , take this one , for instance , " said Dr. Pilar . He was holding up a native fruit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rind with heliotrope spots on it . " It 's a very good example of exactly what we 're up against . Ever since we discovered this particular fruit , we 've been interested in it because the analyses show that it should be an excellent source of basic food elements . Presumably , it even tastes good ; our monkeys seemed to like it . " " What 's the matter with it , then ? " asked Major Grodski , eying the fruit with sleepy curiosity . Dr. Pilar gave the thing a wry look and put it back in the specimen bag . " Except for the fact that it has killed every one of our test specimens , we do n't know what 's wrong with it . " Colonel Fennister looked around the laboratory at the cages full of chittering animals  --  monkeys , white mice , rats , guinea pigs , hamsters , and the others . Then he looked back at the scientist . " Do n't you know what killed them ? " Pilar did n't answer ; instead , he glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his abdomen and rubbed his fingertips together . " We 're not sure . Thus far , it looks as though death was caused by oxygen starvation in the tissues . " " Some kind of anemia ? " hazarded the colonel . Smathers frowned . " The end results are similar , but there is no drop in the hemoglobin  --  in fact , it seems to rise a little . We 're still investigating that . We have n't got all the answers yet , by any means , but since we do n't quite know what to look for , we 're rather hampered . " The colonel nodded slowly . " Lack of equipment ? " " Pretty much so , " admitted Dr. Smathers . " Remember , we 're just here for preliminary investigation . When the ship brings in more men and equipment  --  " His voice trailed off . Very likely , when the ship returned , it would find an empty base . The first-string team simply was n't set up for exhaustive work ; its job was to survey the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete team to solve . Establishing the base had been of primary importance , and that was the sort of equipment that had been carried on the ship . That  --  and food . The scientists had only the barest essentials to work with ; they had no electron microscopes or any of the other complex instruments necessary for exhaustive biochemical work . Now that they were engaged in a fight for survival , they felt like a gang of midgets attacking a herd of water-buffalo with penknives . Even if they won the battle , the mortality rate would be high , and their chances of winning were pretty small . The Space Service officers and the scientists discussed the problem for over an hour , but they came to no promising conclusion . At last , Colonel Fennister said : " Very well , Dr. Pilar ; we 'll have to leave the food supply problem in your hands . Meanwhile , I 'll try to keep order here in the camp . " * * * * * SM/2 Broderick MacNeil may not have had a top-level grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , his conscience was nagging him , and he was beginning to wonder who was goofing and why . After much thinking  --  if we may so refer to MacNeil 's painful cerebral processes  --  he decided to ask a few cautious questions . Going without food tends to make for mental fogginess , snarling tempers , and general physical lassitude in any group of men . And , while quarter rations were not quite starvation meals , they closely approached it . It was fortunate , therefore , that MacNeil decided to approach Dr. Pilar . Dr. Petrelli 's temper , waspish by nature , had become positively virulent in the two weeks that had passed since the destruction of the major food cache . Dr. Smathers was losing weight from his excess , but his heretofore pampered stomach was voicelessly screaming along his nerve passages , and his fingers had become shaky , which is unnerving in a surgeon , so his temper was no better than Petrelli 's . Pilar , of course , was no better fed , but he was calmer than either of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use as much energy . So , when the big hulking spaceman appeared at the door of his office with his cap in his hands , he was inclined to be less brusque than he might have been . " Yes ? What is it ? " he asked . He had been correlating notes in his journal with the thought in the back of his mind that he would never finish it , but he felt that a small respite might be relaxing . MacNeil came in and looked nervously around at the plain walls of the pre-fab plastic dome-hut as though seeking consolation from them . Then he straightened himself in the approved military manner and looked at the doctor . " You Dr. Piller ? Sir ? " " Pilar , " said the scientist in correction . " If you 're looking for the medic , you 'll want Dr. Smathers , over in G Section . " " Oh , yessir , " said MacNeil quickly , " I know that . But I ai n't sick . " He did n't feel that sick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from B Company . Could I ask you something , sir ? " Pilar sighed a little , then smiled . " Go ahead , spaceman . " MacNeil wondered if maybe he 'd ought to ask the doctor about his sacroiliac pains , then decided against it . This was n't the time for it . " Well , about the food . Uh ... Doc , can men eat monkey food all right ? " Pilar smiled . " Yes . What food there is left for the monkeys has already been sent to the men 's mess hall . " He did n't add that the lab animals would be the next to go . Quick-frozen , they might help eke out the dwindling food supply , but it would be better not to let the men know what they were eating for a while . When they got hungry enough , they would n't care . But MacNeil was plainly puzzled by Pilar 's answer . He decided to approach the stuff as obliquely as he knew how . " Doc , sir , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit in his teeth and plunged ahead . " If I done something against the regulations , would you have to report me to Captain Bellwether ? " Dr. Pilar leaned back in his chair and looked at the big man with interest . " Well , " he said carefully , " that would all depend on what it was . If it was something really ... ah ... dangerous to the welfare of the expedition , I 'd have to say something about it , I suppose , but I 'm not a military officer , and minor infractions do n't concern me . " MacNeil absorbed that " Well , sir , this ai n't much , really  --  I ate something I should n't of . " Pilar drew down his brows . " Stealing food , I 'm afraid , would be a major offense , under the circumstances . " MacNeil looked both startled and insulted . " Oh , nossir ! I never swiped no food ! In fact , I 've been givin ' my chow to my buddies . " Pilar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him looked in exceptionally good health for one who had been on a marginal diet for two weeks . " Then what have you been living on ? " " The monkey food , sir . " " Monkey food ? " " Yessir . Them greenish things with the purple spots . You know  --  them fruits you feed the monkeys on . " Pilar looked at MacNeil goggle-eyed for a full thirty seconds before he burst into action . * * * * * " No , of course I wo n't punish him , " said Colonel Fennister . " Something will have to go on the record , naturally , but I 'll just restrict him to barracks for thirty days and then recommend him for light duty . But are you sure ? " " I 'm sure , " said Pilar , half in wonder . Fennister glanced over at Dr. Smathers , now noticeably thinner in the face . The medic was looking over MacNeil 's record . " But if that fruit kills monkeys and rats and guinea pigs , how can a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Smathers , without taking his eyes off the record sheets . He did n't amplify the statement . The colonel looked back at Pilar . " That 's the trouble with test animals , " Dr. Pilar said , ruffling his gray beard with a fingertip . " You take a rat , for instance . A rat can live on a diet that would kill a monkey . If there 's no vitamin A in the diet , the monkey dies , but the rat makes his own vitamin A ; he does n't need to import it , you might say , since he can synthesize it in his own body . But a monkey ca n't . " That 's just one example . There are hundreds that we know of and God alone knows how many that we have n't found yet . " Fennister settled his own body more comfortably in the chair and scratched his head thoughtfully . " Then , even after a piece of alien vegetation has passed all the animal tests , you still could n't be sure it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why we ask for volunteers . But we have n't lost a man so far . Sometimes a volunteer will get pretty sick , but if a food passes all the other tests , you can usually depend on its not killing a human being . " " I gather that this is a pretty unusual case , then ? " Pilar frowned . " As far as I know , yes . But if something kills all the test animals , we do n't ask for humans to try it out . We assume the worst and forget it . " He looked musingly at the wall . " I wonder how many edible plants we 've by-passed that way ? " he asked softly , half to himself . " What are you going to do next ? " the colonel asked . " My men are getting hungry . " Smathers looked up from the report in alarm , and Pilar had a similar expression on his face . " For Pete 's sake , " said Smathers , " do n't tell anyone  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want all your men rushing out in the forest to gobble down those things until we are more sure of them . Give us a few more days at least . " The colonel patted the air with a hand . " Do n't worry . I 'll wait until you give me the go-ahead . But I 'll want to know your plans . " Pilar pursed his lips for a moment before he spoke . " We 'll check up on MacNeil for another forty-eight hours . We 'd like to have him transferred over here , so that we can keep him in isolation . We 'll feed him more of the ... uh ... what 'd he call ' em , Smathers ? " " Banana-pears . " " We 'll feed him more banana-pears , and keep checking . If he is still in good shape , we 'll ask for volunteers . " " Good enough , " said the colonel . " I 'll keep in touch . " * * * * * On the morning of the third day in isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his normal assortment of vitamins , added a couple of aspirin tablets , and took a dose of Epsom salts for good measure . Then he yawned and leaned back to wait for breakfast . He was certainly getting enough fresh fruit , that was certain . He 'd begun to worry about whether he was getting a balanced diet  --  he 'd heard that a balanced diet was very important  --  but he figured that the doctors knew what they were doing . Leave it up to them . He 'd been probed and needled and tested plenty in the last couple of days , but he did n't mind it . It gave him a feeling of confidence to know that the doctors were taking care of him . Maybe he ought to tell them about his various troubles ; they all seemed like nice guys . On the other hand , it would n't do to get booted out of the Service . He 'd think it over for a while . He settled back to doze a little while he waited for his breakfast to be served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * * Later on that same day , Dr. Pilar put out a call for volunteers . He still said nothing about MacNeil ; he simply asked the colonel to say that it had been eaten successfully by a test animal . The volunteers ate their banana-pears for lunch , approaching them warily at first , but soon polishing them off with gusto , proclaiming them to have a fine taste . The next morning , they felt weak and listless . Thirty-six hours later , they were dead . " Oxygen starvation , " said Smathers angrily , when he had completed the autopsies . Broderick MacNeil munched pleasantly on a banana-pear that evening , happily unaware that three of his buddies had died of eating that self-same fruit . * * * * * The chemist , Dr. Petrelli , looked at the fruit in his hand , snarled suddenly , and smashed it to the floor . Its skin burst , splattering pulp all over the gray plastic . " It looks , " he said in a high , savage voice , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive when the ship returns ! " He turned to look at Smathers , who was peering through a binocular microscope . " Smathers , what makes him different ? " " How do I know ? " growled Dr. Smathers , still peering . " There 's something different about him , that 's all . " Petrelli forcibly restrained his temper . " Very funny , " he snapped . " Not funny at all , " Smathers snapped back . " No two human beings are identical  --  you know that . " He lifted his gaze from the eyepiece of the instrument and settled in on the chemist . " He 's got AB blood type , for one thing , which none of the volunteers had . Is that what makes him immune to whatever poison is in those things ? I do n't know . " Were the other three allergic to some protein substance in the fruit , while MacNeil is n't ? I do n't know . " Do his digestive processes destroy the poison ? I do n't know . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , but I ca n't even be sure of that . The leucocytes are a little high , the red cell count is a little low , the hemoglobin shows a little high on the colorimeter , but none of ' em seems enough to do any harm . " It might be an enzyme that destroys the ability of the cells to utilize oxygen . It might be anything ! " His eyes narrowed then , as he looked at the chemist . " After all , why have n't you isolated the stuff from the fruit ? " " There 's no clue as to what to look for , " said Petrelli , somewhat less bitingly . " The poison might be present in microscopic amounts . Do you know how much botulin toxin it takes to kill a man ? A fraction of a milligram ! " Smathers looked as though he were about to quote the minimum dosage , so Petrelli charged on : " If you think anyone could isolate an unknown organic compound out of a  --  " " Gentlemen ! Please ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a strain , but bickering wo n't help . What about your latest tests on MacNeil , Dr. Smathers ? " " As far as I can tell , he 's in fine health . And I ca n't understand why , " said the physician in a restrained voice . Pilar tapped one of the report sheets . " You mean the vitamins ? " " I mean the vitamins , " said Smathers . " According to Dr. Petrelli , the fruits contain neither A nor B1 . After living solely on them for four weeks now , he should be beginning to show some deficiencies  --  but he 's not . " No signs ? " queried Dr. Pilar . " No symptoms ? " " No signs  --  at least no abnormal ones . He 's not getting enough protein , but , then , none of us is . " He made a bitter face . " But he has plenty of symptoms . " Dr. Petrelli raised a thin eyebrow . " What 's the difference between a sign and a symptom ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is something that can be objectively checked by another person than the patient . Lesions , swellings , inflammations , erratic heartbeat , and so on . A symptom is a subjective feeling of the patient , like aches , pains , nausea , dizziness , or spots before the eyes . " And MacNeil is beginning to get all kinds of symptoms . Trouble is , he 's got a record of hypochondria , and I ca n't tell which of the symptoms are psychosomatic and which , if any , might be caused by the fruit . " " The trouble is , " said Petrelli , " that we have an unidentifiable disease caused by an unidentifiable agent which is checked by an unidentifiable something in MacNeil . And we have neither the time nor the equipment to find out . This is a job that a fully equipped research lab might take a couple of years to solve . " " We can keep trying , " said Pilar , " and hope we stumble across it by accident . " Illustration Petrelli nodded and picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate . He added a chelating agent which , if there were any nickel present , would sequester the nickel ions and bring them out of solution as a brick-red precipitate . Smathers scowled and bent over his microscope to count more leucocytes . Pilar pushed his notes aside and went over to check his agar plates in the constant-temperature box . The technicians who had been listening to the conversation with ears wide open went back to their various duties . And all of them tried in vain to fight down the hunger pangs that were corroding at their insides . * * * * * Broderick MacNeil lay in his bed and felt pleasantly ill . He treasured each one of his various symptoms ; each pain and ache was just right . He had n't been so comfortable in years . It really felt fine to have all those doctors fussing over him . They got snappy and irritable once in a while , but then , all them brainy people had a tendency to do that . He wondered how the rest of the boys were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't getting any special treatment . MacNeil had decided just that morning that he 'd leave the whole state of his health in the hands of the doctors . No need for a fellow to dose himself when there were three medics on the job , was there ? If he needed anything , they 'd give it to him , so he 'd decided to take no medicine . A delightful , dulling lassitude was creeping over him . * * * * * " MacNeil ! MacNeil ! Wake up , MacNeil ! " The spaceman vaguely heard the voice , and tried to respond , but a sudden dizziness overtook him . His stomach felt as though it were going to come loose from his interior . " I 'm sick , " he said weakly . Then , with a terrible realization , " I 'm really awful sick ! " He saw Dr. Smathers ' face swimming above him and tried to lift himself from the bed . " Shoulda taken pills , " he said through the haze that was beginning to fold over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unconscious again . Dr. Smathers looked at him bleakly . The same thing was killing MacNeil as had killed the others . It had taken longer  --  much longer . But it had come . And then the meaning of the spaceman 's mumbled words came to him . Pills ? Locker box ? He grabbed the unconscious man 's right hand and shoved his right thumb up against the sensor plate in the front of the metal box next to the bed . He could have gotten the master key from Colonel Fennister , but he had n't the time . The box door dilated open , and Dr. Smathers looked inside . When he came across the bottles , he swore under his breath , then flung the spaceman 's arm down and ran from the room . * * * * * " That 's where he was getting his vitamins , then , " said Dr. Pilar as he looked over the assortment of bottles that he and Smathers had taken from the locker box . " Look at ' em . He 's got almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the physician . " Do you suppose it was just vitamins that kept him going ? " " I do n't know , " said Smathers . " I 've given him massive doses of every one of the vitamins  --  from my own supplies , naturally . He may rally round , if that 's what it was . But why would he suddenly be affected by the stuff now ? " " Maybe he quit taking them ? " Pilar made it half a question . " It 's possible , " agreed Smathers . " A hypochondriac will sometimes leave off dosing himself if there 's a doctor around to do it for him . As long as the subconscious need is filled , he 's happy . " But he was shaking his head . " What 's the matter ? " Pilar asked . Smathers pointed at the bottles . " Some of those are mislabeled . They all say vitamins of one kind or another on the label , but the tablets inside are n't all vitamins . MacNeil 's been giving himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trifle . " Do you suppose  --  " " That one of them is an antidote ? " Smathers snorted . " Hell , anything 's possible at this stage of the game . The best thing we can do , I think , is give him a dose of everything there , and see what happens . " * * * * * " Yeah , Doc , yeah , " said MacNeil smiling weakly , " I feel a little better . Not real good , you understand , but better . " Under iron control , Dr. Smathers put on his best bedside manner , while Pilar and Petrelli hovered in the background . " Now , look , son , " said Smathers in a kindly voice , " we found the medicines in your locker box . " MacNeil 's face fell , making him look worse . He 'd dropped down close to death before the conglomerate mixture which had been pumped into his stomach had taken effect , and Smathers had no desire to put too much pressure on the man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said hurriedly ; " We 'll see to it that you are n't punished for it . It 's all right . We just want to ask you a few questions . " " Sure , Doc ; anything , " said MacNeil . But he still looked apprehensive . " Have you been dosing yourself pretty regularly with these things ? " " Well ... uh ... well , yeah . Sometimes . " He smiled feebly . " Sometimes I did n't feel so good , and I did n't want to bother the medics . You know how it is . " " Very considerate , I 'm sure , " said Smathers with just the barest trace of sarcasm , which , fortunately , fell unheeded on MacNeil 's ears . " But which ones did you take every day ? " " Just the vitamins . " He paused . " And ... uh ... maybe an aspirin . The only things I took real regular were the vitamins , though . That 's all right ai n't it ? Ai n't vitamins food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you take yesterday morning , before you got so sick ? " " Just the vitamins , " MacNeil said stoutly . " I figured that since you docs was takin ' care of me , I did n't need no medicine . " Dr. Smathers glanced up hopelessly at the other two men . " That eliminates the vitamins , " he said , sotto voce . He looked back at the patient . " No aspirin ? No APC 's ? You did n't have a headache at all ? " MacNeil shook his head firmly . " I do n't get headaches much . " Again he essayed a feeble smile . " I ai n't like you guys , I do n't overwork my brains . " " I 'm sure you do n't , " said Smathers . Then his eyes gleamed . " You have quite a bit of stomach trouble , eh ? Your digestion bad ? " " Yeah . You know ; I told you about it . I get heartburn and acid stomach pretty often . And constipation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , different things . Sometimes a soda pill , sometimes milk of magnesia , different things . " Smathers looked disappointed , but before he could say anything , Dr. Petrelli 's awed but excited voice came from behind him . " Do you take Epsom salts ? " " Yeah . " " I wonder  --  " said Petrelli softly . And then he left for the lab at a dead run . * * * * * Colonel Fennister and Major Grodski sat at the table in the lab , munching on banana-pears , blissfully enjoying the sweet flavor and the feeling of fullness they were imparting to their stomachs . " MacNeil ca n't stay in the service , of course , " said Fennister . " That is , not in any space-going outfit . We 'll find an Earthside job for him , though . Maybe even give him a medal . You sure these things wo n't hurt us ? " Dr. Pilar started to speak , but Petrelli cut him off . " Positive , " said the chemist . " After we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' poison ' was a chelating agent , that 's all . You saw the test run I did for you . " The colonel nodded . He 'd watched the little chemist add an iron salt to some of the fruit juice and seen it turn red . Then he 'd seen it turn pale yellow when a magnesium salt was added . " But what 's a chelating agent ? " he asked . " There are certain organic compounds , " Dr. Petrelli explained , " that are ... well , to put it simply , they 're attracted by certain ions . Some are attracted by one ion , some by another . The chelating molecules cluster around the ion and take it out of circulation , so to speak ; they neutralize it , in a way . " Look , suppose you had a dangerous criminal on the loose , and did n't have any way to kill him . If you kept him surrounded by policemen all the time , he could n't do anything . See ? " The Space Service Officers nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ion , " the chemist continued . " It 's used quite frequently in medicine , as Dr. Smathers will tell you . For instance , beryllium ions in the body can be deadly ; beryllium poisoning is nasty stuff . But if the patient is treated with the proper chelating agent , the ions are surrounded and do n't do any more damage . They 're still there , but now they 're harmless , you see . " " Well , then , " said the colonel , " just what did this stuff in the fruit do ? " " It sequestered the iron ions in the body . They could n't do their job . The body had to quit making hemoglobin , because hemoglobin needs iron . So , since there was no hemoglobin in the bloodstream , the patient developed sudden pernicious anemia and died of oxygen starvation . " Colonel Fennister looked suddenly at Dr. Smathers . " I thought you said the blood looked normal . " " It did , " said the physician . " The colorimeter showed extra hemoglobin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit turns red when it 's connected up with iron  --  in fact , it 's even redder than blood hemoglobin . And the molecules containing the sequestered iron tend to stick to the outside of the red blood cells , which threw the whole test off . " " As I understand it , then , " said Major Grodski , " the antidote for the ... uh ... chelating agent is magnesium ? " " That 's right , " said Dr. Petrelli , nodding . " The stuff prefers magnesium ions to ferrous ions . They fit better within the chelating ring . Any source of magnesium will do , so long as there 's plenty of it . MacNeil was using milk of magnesia , which is the hydroxide , for ' gastric acidity ' . It 's changed to chloride in the stomach . And he was using Epsom salts  --  the sulfate , and magnesium citrate as laxatives . He was well protected with magnesium ions . " " We tried it ourselves first , naturally , " said Dr. Pilar . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we 'll be able to make it until the ship comes . " Major Grodski sighed . " Well , if not , I 'll at least die with a full stomach . " He reached for another banana-pear , then looked over at Petrelli . " Pass the salt , please . " Silently and solemnly , the chemist handed him the Epsom salts . THE END
