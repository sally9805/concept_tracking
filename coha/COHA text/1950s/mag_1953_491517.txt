No matter where the girl went , Donald turned up too . He was in love  --  hut it was one-sided . She only wondered How Can I Get Rid of Him ? By RICHARD STERN T HAT season the Americans , reversing the great trade route , beat a path by train , bus and auto- mobile from Le Havre to Paris to Lyons , down the Rhone Valley to Avignon , around the circuit of Nimes , Arles and Aix-en-Provence , and then steadied on their course to the COte d'Azur and Italy beyond . It was , it seemed , almost automatic , and I do not know why . The swallows make straight for Capistrano , the storks for Andalusia and Castile  --  who can account for patterns of migration ? Their ship docked at Le Havre . " If we hurry , " Donald said , " we can catch a taxi to the station . ' " I am quite capable , thank you , " Darcy said , of taking care of ? " " We 're relatives , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was grinning at her , as he had grinned that first day in the cabin before the ship had even left New York , as he had grinned at her during every meal of the second seating , and the times in between . Darcy said , " We 're on shore now , thank heavens , and the farce is finished . Just because by an outrageous coincidence we happen to have the same name ? " " And the same initial . " It was , it seemed , a joke of which he would never tire . He bent across the customs counter and smiled at the plump inspectress and spoke to her in rapid French . She beamed and waddled toward their baggage . Darcy said , " Madame ? " She put words together laboriously in her mind . " Why buck fate ? " Donald said . " Sooner or later , your luggage has to he inspected . " He stopped . Madame the inspectress was speaking . Donald listened , nodded . He got out his keys .

" He said something more in French . Madame chuckled , shaking with her glee . She made her cabalistic symbol with a piece of chalk . She looked at Darcy . " Well , " Darcy said . She unlocked the big suitcase . They shared a taxi to the station . It was , after all , the only sensible thing to do . And they sat aide by side in the train compartment , watching the Normandy countryside elide past , craning their necks for a view of the Rouen Cathedral , seeing the neat farms like picture post cards , and the first glimpse of the Seine , and , at last , Paris and the great , gloomy shed of Gare St. Lazare .

If you have n't seen your congressman starring in his own production , just stand by  --  you soon will ! M AST July , after ripping through its backlog of pending business , Congress rushed out of Washington , bent on trying to assemble 1952 's political jackstraws into political fences of some kind . All but deserted , the Old House Office Building should have lapsed into a catacomb-like hush . Instead , steel slammed and rang through the corridoni . At the north side of the building , ground floor and basement , workmen attacked the " Old House bathhouse section . " They tore into walls and flooring with crowbar and hammer . They wrenched out elderly plumbing . They uprooted tubs planted in 1905 to insure cleanliness of person among legislators of the period . Nothing was sacred . Out went the massive , hand-carved marble bath where , in the words of a forgotten contemporary , crusty old Uncle Joe Cannon as Speaker of the House of Representatives and iron-whimmed legislative dictator was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Out , too , went an elaborate static shocking mnchine ? resembling a cross between a vintage upright piano and an electric chair  --  which House cronies of Uncle Joe had installed at public expense in the pathetic hope that it might cure the common hang-over . Demolition and clearing away done , television engineers and electricians invaded the place . Skeinsof cables went behind and through walls to feed power to lights , cameras . sound equipment , developing labs and the like . Carpenters soundproofed a **25;4333;TOOLONG studio and a slightly smaller one , adjoining . They remodeled shower stalls and installed dressing rooms . Now Congress has brand-new TV recording facilities , The new studios are small , as such things go . but the paraphernalia is the last word of its kind . Members of the new , 83rd Congress need take no back seats to Hopalong and Uncle Miltie . In air-conditioned comfort they can perform in the style best suited to their personalities .

Almost the whole population of the town had come to sit in the darkness to watch . On either side of the interior a fire door had been opened and the audience might have looked out upon back lots and a low constellation beyond which flickered occasionally a licking tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything but the actions of the play , their imaginations impassioned for some life other than the familiar banalities of their own . The young man watched Kitty Du-camp , as a French maid , and heard her say the words " Madame est servie . " He followed every motion of her minor role , saw her interrupt a flirtation between the great man and the delicate woman who was his wife . Staring in the darkness , he knew that this must be the reality and that it was the scenes of the daytime which had been the illusion . The quiet tired woman , the unshaven man whose suit had been rumpled , the girl who had found the time and had had the willingness to walk with him through the country streets in all their shabbiness  --  that had been the pretense . The life which they truly lived chattered in its gaiety before him and beyond his reach . The man was witty and smoked expensive cigars . The woman was ageless and , there , her beauty was brilliant . The girl who had walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town was in truth a pert woman who knew things which he would never know ; and if she remembered him later he knew that she would laugh , imagining what he had wished to say in his country awkwardness . He saw her again in the theater lobby . She was offering small sample vials of a new perfume , also called Paris Roundtrip , which for a grateful fee the troupe introduced in each town in which they appeared . She still wore the costume of a French maid , and she smiled at the country faces which looked shyly into hers from the dispersing crowd as rude hands took the tiny gift . When the last of the audience had shuffled , as though regretfully , into the dark she saw him waiting . " Oh , you , " she cried out . " How did you like me in the play ? " " I liked you , " he said ; and she wondered at the solemnity and the earnestness in his face . When she had removed her make-up and had changed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he walked with her to the hotel . They stood at the steps talking , while the lights in windows and in the streets of the town went out . The night marshal came deliberately along the street , trying store doors . Seeing the two figures , he approached unhurriedly . When he recognized one of them he spoke . " Good night , Arthur . Good night , miss , " the officer said . Behind the departing footsteps the small town brimmed with darkness , silence and sleep . The boy spoke to his companion . " Can I come in the morning and take you to the train ? " " Of course , " the girl said . She watched , from the unlighted hallway of the hotel , the tall figure disappear into the deeper darkness of the street ; then she went quietly up the pine steps to her room . The next morning the boy wakened early . The town taxi had taken the father and the mother , with the troupe 's luggage , to the station . The girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first on Eufaula Street , away from the monument in the square and from the red-and-yellow tin marquee of The Playhouse and from the porch of the Verbena Hotel . They turned into Depot Street and saw the dirty gray station and the rails of the tracks gleaming in the sun . The luggage was set beside the tracks . The actor and his wife stood looking at the rows of fat cotton stalks , a yellowing green standing across the endless fields . The four people stood self-consciously while they waited for the uncertain country train . The young man looked silently and regretfully at the girl , wishing that she had never known the bright cities from which the troupe had probably come and the gaiety of the life which he could not share and which he could never expect her to leave for any life that he might offer her . He saw that her face had saddened ; she was looking back at the town , He thought that she had become bored with him , that his being here embarrassed her . He felt that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the troupe was inside the gritty car , the father placed the bags in two empty seats . He sat alone , sprawled across the dusty red velvet of a seat on the shady side of the train . The young man watching outside saw that the girl at the window above him , seated beside her mother , was waving . She looked steadily at his diminishing figure as the train increased the momentum of departure ; she could see that his arm was lifted in a last hopeless gesture of farewell . The girl spoke to the preoccupied woman beside her . " It was a pretty little town , mother , was n't it ? " The woman did not speak for a few seconds , as though made silent by the increasing rhythm of the wheels clicking over the sections of the rails . Then she answered . " Yes , Kitty . It must have been . " The woman saw the enormous terror as she looked into her daughter 's eyes . " Mother , " ? the voice was pleading like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The woman could not answer . She held the girl 's hand , which trembled in her own . Above the words which she tried to say , there came the faster clicking of the wheels and an occasional screech as the short train hurried through the rural desolation toward another unknown country town . The figure beside the station had waited as long as the train was visible . Looking now he could see nothing , but he continued to stare . Distance had never seemed so vast . He turned back toward the town . The shadows through which he walked were strangely murmurous ; the conversation and the laughter of yesterday seemed to precede him as he moved along . He remembered her face . He could not discover in its image now any scorn for himself or mockery of the town ; memory revealed love and longing which he had not been wise enough to see when she was with him there . So forceful was the vision of the revelation in her face that he stopped in the burning light beyond the stir of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickened , trying to adjust his body to the gathering determination of his will . He estimated the distance to the town to which the troupe had gone . " It 's not far at all , " he said , as though he were repeating his answer of yesterday about the hotel . " I 'll get the car and be there by early afternoon . "
