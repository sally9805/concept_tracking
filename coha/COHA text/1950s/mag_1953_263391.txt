Like many another schoolboy , Giuseppe Conte , 16 , a sophomore at Rome 's Leonardo da Vinci High School , felt misunderstood . He was sure , for instance , that his math teacher had it in for him . He was always prepared , Giuseppe assured his parents , but Professor Renzo Modugno , a crippled war veteran , twisted the questions so he could n't possibly answer . Last week , when the semester 's grades were announced , Giuseppe heard that he had flunked his math . To make matters worse , Professor Modugno humiliated him by announcing that even the failing grade was higher than he deserved . Giuseppe walked home brooding over the injustice of it all . He pried open the locked chest that contained his father 's pistol , put the 7.65 Browning automatic in his pocket and went back to his afternoon classes . <P> Cold Steel &; Cowardice . When the math lesson ended , Giuseppe put his hand on the bulge in his pocket and left the classroom . Out in the corridor , Professor Modugno leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took aim and tired three shots which hit his teacher in the right lung , the skull and the groin After giving himself up , he said he had planned to kill himself too , but decided it would be cowardly . <P> Professor Modugno regained consciousness only long enough to forgive Giuseppe before he died . Huge bareheaded crowds turned out to watch while schoolboys carried the coffin through Rome 's silent streets . At the professor 's bier in the Piazza di Spagna , Mayor Salvatore Rebecchini spoke for all high-school teachers : " Be good , boys and girls , be good . " <P> Guns &; Slingshots . But Rome 's students did not see to pay attention . Hardly had the bells stopped tolling when another schoolboy , Filiberto Accica came home to weep over his failing grades in Latin and Greek . All day and all night he shut himself in his room , brooding as Giuseppe had . On Sunday morning , in the bright spring sunshine , he opened his window and jumped to his death . For his Greek professor , Filiberto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I kill myself . " <P> All last week the Italian press cried for school reform Said the Demo-Christian Il Popolo : " The youth of today finds his moral support in a society of comic books movies and shows . . . where men &; women shoot and poison , steal and assault ; the representation of a jungle world . " We are all convinced , " said Milan 's Corriere delta Sera , " that the Italian school program is loaded in a frightening manner . We must impose a remedy . " Shrilled the Communist L'Unit : " The responsibility lies with the system in which we live , which transforms the school into a camp of ruthless competition for diplomas . " But until school reform got under way L'Europeo had some advice for Italian school kids : " Away with guns and back to the slingshot. "
