Thirteen years and 113 announced nuclear and thermonuclear blasts after the first fateful mushroom cloud at Alamogordo , N. Mex. , the U.S. committed itself to a grave decision . President Dwight Eisenhower , appearing before TV and newsreel cameras in Washington , announced that the U.S. was ready to suspend its nuclear-weapons tests for one year effective Oct. 31 . The President attached two major conditions . He required that 1 ) the U.S.S.R. agree to begin political talks by Oct. 31 , aimed at setting up a world network of posts equipped to detect nuclear explosions , presumably in Red China as well as the U.S.S.R. , and 2 ) the U.S.S.R. refrain from resuming its own nuclear-weapons tests , which it unilaterally suspended last March . <P> The President continued with terms for the more distant future . The U.S. , he said , was also ready to suspend tests on a year-to-year basis after Oct. 31 , 1959 , provided that 1 ) the world detection network is installed and working satisfactorily , and 2 ) progress is being made in U.S.-U.S.S.R. negotiations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike : " As the U.S. has frequently made clear , the suspension of testing is not in itself a measure of disarmament . An agreement in this respect is significant if it leads to other and more substantial agreements . It is in this hope that the U.S. makes this proposal . " <P> The Earnest Discussion . The fateful U.S. decision was made by Dwight Eisenhower alone . But behind his personal decision lay weeks of earnest discussion between top-level Administration officials , each one expressing his fears , or his hopes , in the light of his particular governmental function . The calendar of one of the U.S. 's most soul-wrenching secret debates : <P> WINTER 1958 . President Eisenhower and Presidential Science Adviser James Killian set up a panel of scientists to determine whether a worldwide net of seismographic , acoustic and other equipment could detect a violation of any U.S.-U.S.S.R. agreement to suspend tests . Named to head the panel : Cornell University 's Dr. Hans Bethe , an acknowledged expert in the detection field . <P> APRIL . The Bethe Panel submitted its report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The panel 's chief finding : an effective detection network could indeed be set up . The report rocked the Pentagon , challenged the judgment of AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss that rogue-proof detection was not possible . But on the diplomatic side , it convinced Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that a stop-the-tests agreement was technically feasible , therefore worth exploring for its effect on world opinion . <P> MAY THROUGH JULY . President Eisenhower invited the Kremlin to send a delegation of U.S.S.R. scientists to sit down with U.S. and British scientists in Geneva for a joint study on test detection . The Kremlin accepted , then tried to back out . Finally , when the U.S. said its scientists would show up at Geneva with or without the Soviet representatives , the U.S.S.R. okayed the talks , sent Communist scientists to the conference room .
