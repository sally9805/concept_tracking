TWO cherished economic maxims no longer hold true in the U.S. economy of today : <P> Prices do not rise and fall in strict relation to the demand for goods and services . <P> Wages do not drop or climb according to the supply of labor-or the amount of unemployment . <P> These lessons , brought home by the current recession , were the principal topics of 47 leading economists who were asked by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress to examine the question : can the U.S. achieve maximum ( or full ) employment as laid down in the Employment Act of 1946 and at the same time achieve stable prices ? The economists ' answer : No . Said University of Michigan Economist Gardner Ackley : " We can not aim at absolutely full employment , or even 98% employment , unless we are willing to accept considerable inflation . " <P> - <P> Economists have long known that 100% employment is impossible under any circumstances because there is always a certain amount of frictional unemployment caused by transitional or " between-job " idleness . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " reasonably full employment " could be achieved along with stable prices , generally agreed that it would average out at 96% employment , or 4% unemployment . If unemployment rose above 4% , they felt that lowered purchasing power would cause prices to fall ; if unemployment dropped below 4% , increasing demand would push prices higher . Now they know that this level no longer applies . The level of unemployment is getting progressively higher simply because the mere availability of labor or products has less and less effect . <P> In 1949 unemployment averaged 5.5% of the labor force , and prices dropped 1.9% on the BLS Consumer Price Index . But in 1954 , when unemployment was about as high , prices declined only .5% . In short , prices are growing more and more rigid . Unemployment stands at 7.5% of the labor force , yet prices are still climbing . Last month they hit an alltime record 123.5 on the index , and no real end to the upward spiral is in sight . <P> - <P> Demand no longer sets the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Turner points out , " prices are not related significantly to demand , but to costs . The price setting process has been shifted from the competitive marketplace to the conference table . " <P> <P> In the same way , wages are growing more and more rigid . They are on a ratchet , clicking steadily higher , but locked against any slippage downward . Despite the recession , there are so many escalator clauses , unemployment benefits , and automatic increases that wages this year are still going up ( see State of Business ) . The belief that rising productivity will make up for wage increases , thus holding prices stable , has also proved false-at least in the short run . In 1957 wages jumped 4.5% , yet output per man-hour rose only 1.8%-and prices jumped 3% . The Government , with its farm subsidy and other aid programs to various sectors of the U.S. economy , also keeps an upward pressure on wages and prices regardless of what happens to employment .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
