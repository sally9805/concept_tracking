txt There is a particularly provocative phrase in Budget Director Percival Brundage 's letter of resignation , announced yesterday . In addition to personal reasons , Mr. Brundage wrote President Eisenhower that he is leaving to allow a " fresh viewpoint " at the top of the Budget Bureau . Well , it is no disparagement of Mr. Brundage to say that a fresh viewpoint is just what 's needed . It is no disparagement because budget policy is far less a matter of the personality of the Budget Director than it was a generalion ago . These days a Director is more an agent than a policy-maker , and it would take a Man of exceptionally strong convictions and tough skin to impose fresh views on an unsympathetic Administration . So it is among the policy-makers of the Administration that the fresh viewpoint is needed . The viewpoint that the Federal budget is ' not a toy balloon to be inflated bps any political or pseudoeconomic or sociological breeze . That the criterion of good budgeting is not laxity toward deficits but determination about balance . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spent , but - how ' frugally the people 's money can be spent to provide essential services , That viewpoint would be so fresh it would be a real spring tonic both for the Government and for the economy .
