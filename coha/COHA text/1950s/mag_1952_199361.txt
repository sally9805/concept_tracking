A month after the Korean war began , General Eisenhower said : " You ca n't win anywhere if you do n't win this one . " <P> It is now apparent ( see WAR IN ASIA ) that the U.S. is not going to win the Korean war . Washington has not the will to win it . During eight months of truce negotiations , U.S. forces have grown weaker , the enemy stronger . There is no will to achieve anything more than a stalemate . All Asia will note as a great new fact that the U.S. was unable to cope with the Chinese Reds . <P> Europe , despite years of effort and the expenditure of billions of U.S. dollars , is still not defensible . France , drained by Indo-China , is in grave economic crisis . West Germany is still unarmed , still unable to defend itself against a Russian advance that might make a Communist military spearhead out of German men and industry . <P> This is the background against which Secretary Acheson last week reported " giant strides " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are familiar milestones of the last five years . They are true , in a way . The free world does move , but the question is whether that movement amounts to anything when measured by 1 ) the cost of the U.S. effort and 2 ) the progress of the enemy . Thus measured , the U.S. is taking " giant strides " north on a train that is moving south .
