Sometimes fuel oil is advanced a few mills a gallon while gasoline prices increase more than 14 cent , or that pattein may he reversed . At ? the : times , gasoline might absorb the entire increase while fuel oil remains unchanged . Although Humble 's price hike averaged 35 cents a barrel , specific types of crude were boosted between 25 cents and 15 cents a barrel The price of crude in East Texas . generally considered the basic crude mice for most of the nation .

Some crudes in West Texas and the Panhanoae , however , were boosted by ant , . 25 cents a barrel because of low er refining value Some crudes on the lower Gulf Coast were boosted by as much as 15 cent , a batiel . Hines P. Baker . president of Humble stated : " The immediate cause of this price change is the sharp increase in demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has developed . =Le the flow of Middle East crude oil to Europe and the East Coast was drastically ' cuttailed by recent events Humble has been unable to secure its requirements at former prides . " An important cause of a more basic nature is the substantial rise in unit costs since the previous general increase in crude oil prices in June . 1953 . Dui mg ins period of more than 31 , , years . etude oil prices generally . have remained constant . although wages and.talaries , costs of materials purchased , and the investment required for the same amount of production have all increased greatly . In view of these various circumstances , Humble has advanced prices by an amount that should help it to secure additional supplies which it has been unable to purchase to meet unusually heavy demands . and should also tend to encourage the rate of domestic exploration and development of new oil resources desirable for reasons of national security " Elsewhere , many oil executives withheld immediate comment while they assessed Humble Oil 's action Included in this group was Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co .. operating in the Midcontinent and Rocky Mountain areas . Other concerns with said they were studying the move included such large ones as the Texas Co .. Gulf Oil Corp . Socony Mobil Oil Co. , Sinclair Oil Corp , Cities Service Co .. Atlantic Refining Co , Standard Oil Co ( Ohio ) . Ohio Oil Co .. Sun Oil Co , Pure Oil Co and Phillips Petroleum Co . In San Francisco , executives of Standard Oil Co. of California also said they were " studying " the move . However , the president of a San F'ranciscobased oil producer expressed a " fervent prayer " Humble Oil 's rise " will become the industry pattern . " This official , Jasper Tully of Reserve Oil &; Gas Co. , asserted : " I 'm quite sure we as well as other producers need it because of higher drilling and producing costs . " He reported a " strong feeling " a West Coast increase in crude oil prices last November " was not enough . " West Coast Situation One West Coast oil man noted price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Coast prices directly . West Coast prpducers boosted crude oil prices November 22 by an average of 20 cents a barrel , with the rises ranging up to 40 cents a barrel on the heaviest grades . In the Los Angeles area , officials of at least two companies  --  Richfield Oil Corp . and Union Oil Co. of California  --  indicated they think the November boost is too recent to go for another now . " I do n't know whether the increase will go out of the Mid-continent area Or not , " said a spokesman for Superior Oil Co . " We 've been expecting the price increase in Texas for some time . " " We do n't know what will happen out here ? it 's too early to say , " said a Hancock Oil Co. akdaman in Los Angeles . He noted a lot of - Gulf- Area oil has been going to Europe , and that some costs are higher in Texas and in the Gulf than they are on the West Coast . L. A. Cranson , executive vice president of Honolulu Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Humble price to Increase to set a pattern . " He said oil men have been expecting an increase generally and possibly another oncrease on the West Coast over last November 's rise . " We probably will get another increase here comparable to what develops in the Mid Continent and on the lighter weight crude , ? ? he asserted . Honolulu produces oil in both Texas and California , as well as Canada . the Mid-Con tinent and other areas . Of its average daily production of some 43,000 barrels , about 20,000 barrels comes from Texas wells If Humble Oil 's rise becomes industry-wide , it would be the second general action since 1917 In that year . oil companies raised the price of crude to $2.65 a barrel from $1.70 . In June , 1953 , Phillips Petroleum Co. was the first large oil company to announce a general price boost of 25 cents a barrel . Other oil purchasers followed the Phillips lead within a few days Since 1953 , there have only been localized changes in crude oil prices . Last month , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices by as much as 40 cents a barrel on Mountain crudes specially used for making the heavy fuel oil , which has been in short supply . California crude , raised in November , also yields high amounts of heavy fuels . On the other hand , there also was a seven cent a barrel cut in crude buying prices In West Central Texas last summer by most oil companies . Agitation for a crude oil price increase has been prevalent among so-called independent producers in the inaustry for months : they cited higher exploration and drilling costs After development of the Suez crisis last fall . some industry leaders predicted an advance would take place early in 1957 One oil producer said the price increase would help offset rising costs , but not cover them . H. B. Fuqua , chairman and president of Texas Pacific Coal &; Oil Co. , explained ' ? ? The increase is a step in the right direction , but it 's certainly inadequate in light of what has transpired since the last price rise . Our payroll , for instance , has increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials and services . Mr. Fuqua added that even though the company produced more oil in 1956 than in the previous year . profits were beim , . 1955 " The important thing about the crude price increase , if it becomes ge-eral throughout the Malcontinent area and if it stick ' for a year is that it will give us mot e money to look for more oil . " Sir Funna sae ! The mice increase comes only a few days after the Texas Railroad Commission refused to grant Humble Oil 's request for increased production of Texas crude oil Humble had told the commission last month that in January it would need to bUy an additional 170,000 barrels of oil daily to meet the requirements or Esso Export Corp. , also a Jersey Standard company engaged in crude oil exports to overseas refineries . At that time , Humble asked the commission to put the state on an 18-day producing schedule during January . Last Friday , the commission , in effect , turned down Humble 's request and a similar request by several other major purchasers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as in December . Independent oil producers had argUed for no increase in Texas ' production because of what they called the high stocks of crude oil on hand .
