Peter Pan ( by James M. Barrie ; music by Mark Charlap and Jule Styne ; lyrics by Carolyn Leigh and Betty Comden and Adolph Green ) was bound to become a musical in time-and doubtless in time for Mary Martin to play Peter . She looks as boyish as can be expected of any grownup of the opposite sex . She is hard to beat at singing , she can dance , she can duel with Captain Hook ; and when she flies through the air , she races and soars and dips like some Peter Pan-American . <P> As a Broadway musical , Barrie 's classic is chiefly memorable for Jerome Robbins ' dances . Robbins is more genuinely imaginative than Barrie , and not the least bit cloying ; and with his tearing Indians and tangoing pirates and stylishly prancing animals , he has contrived a succession of gay , unsugared romps . As a kind of grandly baroque Captain Hook , Cyril Ritchard demonstrates delightfully that gusto can be laced with style . <P> If Peter Pan is not all pure gain as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , which has nothing better than the tinkling prettiness of Tender Shepherd or the straightforward lilt of I 've Got to Crow . And with the original Barrie story very much cut into but seldom seeming cut , Peter Pan comes off a bit more of a long show than a fully sustained entertainment . Barrie and Broadway are not quite an ideal couple . But their marriage has been celebrated with truly festive splash and animation .
