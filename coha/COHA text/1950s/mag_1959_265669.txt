THE TENTS OF WICKEDNESS ( 276 pp. ) - Peter De Vries-Little , Brown ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> Peter De Vries had a lunch date in Manhattan recently with visiting British Novelist Kingsley Amis . De Vries spared no effort to round up a third for lunch , his New Yorker colleague , E. B. ( " Andy " ' ) White . The anticipated lunatic-fringe benefit : De Vries would breeze home to Westport , Conn , and tell his wife : " I had lunch today with Amis and Andy . " <P> As it happened , the lunch never came off . and De Vries , like a character in one of his novels ( Comfort Me with Apples , The Mackerel Plaza . The Tunnel of Love ) , was left wistfully savoring the sour cream of the jest . This touch of rueful , pun-prone phantasmagoria has made 49-year-old Peter De Vries the leading comic geographer of commuterland . Humorist De Vries surveys his world with the wacky vision of a man who has inadvertently put on the wrong pair of glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tents of Wickedness , a story told through a sequence of parodies of other writers , among them Marquand , Faulkner , Fitzgerald , Hemingway , Proust , Joyce and Kafka . The reader may come to feel that he has been washed , rinsed and spun dry in a literary Laundromat . <P> What Is Chastity ? Originally planned as part of Comfort Me with Apples ( TIME , April 30 , 1953 ) . the new book almost seems like a double take of the earlier novel . The hero is again Chick Swallow , the poor man 's Freud , who writes a lonelyhearts column called " The Lamplighter . " His chief anxiety is still his sophomoric brother-in-law Nickie Sherman , a fool in bon motley . In Comfort , Nickie salvaged his ego by catching a crook ; in Tents , Nickie becomes a crook , at odd hours , and ends up chasing his own split personality . In Comfort , the happily married Chick found himself unaccountably in bed with an art-loving Mrs. Thicknesse ; in Tents , the still happily married Chick all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appleyard . Everyone gets back on an even keel just in time to sail into De Vries 's moral harbor : " The conformity we often glibly equate with mediocrity is n't something free spirits ' transcend ' as much as something they 're not quite up to . " <P> Author De Vries has rationed his wordplay in Tents and cut down on the puns and epigrams . Samples : " persona non Groton , " " the Symbol Simons of literature , " " What is chastity but an overemphasis on sex ? " In Tents , the literary parodies are the thing , and some of them are hilariously apt . <P> &gt; Hemingway : " ' You were all right in there . How did you know what you 'd find ? There might have been a rat . . . ' ' It was nothing , ' the Colonel shrugged , doing it well , a thing not really usually done well at all . . . We sat with our brandies , keeping talking about style . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
