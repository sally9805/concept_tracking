" God fight them , " wrote Mohammed in the holy Koran . " What liars they are . " Mohammed meant Christians and Jews , whom he had expected to accept his new vision . When they did not respond , he took to the sword . Before the onslaught Eastern Christianity declined in numbers , vigor and territory . Within 80 years of Islam 's birth , the mosque had replaced the church from Antioch to Carthage . <P> Christians have always been puzzled by the Moslem conquest , which took Islam to the Pyrenees and beyond them into France . The Cross had emerged triumphant from the blood bath of Roman persecution . Why had it fallen before the Prophet 's sword ? In The Call of the Minaret ( Oxford University Press ; $6.25 ) , published last fortnight , Anglican priest and Moslem scholar Kenneth Cragg blames not Moslem power but Christian failure for the rise of Islam . " It was a failure in love , in purity , and in fervor , a failure of the spirit , " he argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Why a New Faith ?

And long years of Western domination impelled the Moslem nations to identify Christianity with the unfeeling exploitation and hypocrisy of unenlightened colonialism . <P> Today Christian faces Moslem in a new sort of encounter .

For the first time , Christian and Moslem face each other on equal ground and with mutual need . It is high time , says Author Cragg , for Christians to re-examine their relationship with the children of the Prophet . <P> Judas on the Cross ? " The objective is not , as the Crusaders believed , the repossession of what Christendom has lost , but the restoration to Moslems of the Christ they have missed ... It aims not to have the map more Christian but Christ more widely known . " First task , Author Cragg argues , is to erase the monumental Moslem misunderstandings of Christianity for which the Christian church itself is partly responsible .
