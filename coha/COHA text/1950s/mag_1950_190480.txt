As readers leafed through the advertisements in Esquire last week , they found one that was somewhat different . Instead of the usual collection of he-men modeling pipes , brogues and rakish hats , there was a sylphlike female clad only in a scanty girdle . <P> The ad was an attempt by Chicago 's H. W. Gossard Co. , one of the biggest U.S. foundation garment makers , to make men " girdle conscious . " It hoped that its recumbent model-who , of course , was so well-formed that she had not the slightest need for a girdle-would make men take another look at their wives and hustle them around to the store for a tighter or , at least , better fit . <P> This was a new sales tactic in the corset industry . But Gossard was in the midst of a $600,000-a-year ad campaign ( double last year 's ) , which it hoped would make it the biggest company in the field . With a potential market of 55 million women over the age of 15 , U.S. corset &; brassiere makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are heading even higher . Of the more than 350 companies in the industry , almost half have been started within the past ten years . <P> To help Gossard cash in on this huge boom , the directors fortnight ago elected a new president : Gonzague Alexander Savard , 47 , a plump , hustling French Canadian who had climbed from office boy to president in 31 years by his talent for production and labor relations . <P> When Gossard was strikebound last summer and the garment workers could not come to terms with President Lee Varley , who has now retired , it was Savard who stepped in and settled the trouble . The strike , coupled with reduced promotional activities , had clipped Gossard 's profit 82% last year . When Savard moved into his new job last week , a bunch of roses from the garment workers ' union was on his desk . Said Savard : " Our competitors ran while we stood still , but now we 're going to run . " <P> Curves &; Kangaroos . Gossard was founded on a corset-string in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williamson Gossard . At the time , corsets were laced from the rear and the agonized , swaybacked " Kangaroo figure " of the Gibson Girl was the vogue . In Paris , Gossard bought a dozen corsets which were not only straight and more comfortable than U.S. models , but which laced conveniently up the front ( thus obviating the need for a maid or husband at the other end of the drawstrings ) . <P> Gossard dubbed his model L'lrresistible , sold the first dozen fast in the U.S. for a whopping $50 apiece ( v. the average price of $1.50 for American corsets ) , and soon was producing a simplified $5 version of his own . He standardized for the mass market by classifying the female body into nine " ideal figures " - which were n't so much ideal as they were all-inclusive . Samples : " The Ideal Curved-Back Figure , " " The Ideal Large-Below-the-Waist Figure . " He also shrewdly marked his corsets two inches smaller than they actually were so women would n't squeeze themselves to death .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
