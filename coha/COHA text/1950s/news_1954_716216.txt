txt The Government has indicaj tions of corruption in additional phases of its Multi-million-I dollar housing program , Albert M. Cole , Administrator of they Housing and Home Finance Agency , reported today . But he said he could not elaborate on what other phases of the program were under study . He added that the new conditions probably were not as " bad " as those that had prompted the inquiry into alleged housing irregularities . The investigation centers on Government-insured mortgages on housing projects and on loans for home repairs . Two Senate committees will open public hearings this week . Mr. Cole disclosed there was evidence that one official involved in the current inquiry had received money for favors , presumably to builders . The housing chief , appearing on the National Broadcasting Company 's television program , " Meet the Press , " said that the allegations against this unidentified official could not be disclosed . " I can not reveal the nature of the allegations , " he ? declared , " except to say to you they are serious . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint . We are ready to listen to him at any time to explain his side of the position , and he ! has not done so . " ' Windfalls ' to Be Investigated Mr. Colt probably will be asked to elaborate on both the suggestion of broader housing scandals and the unidentified official during the Senate hearings , one of which opens tomorrow . The Banking Committee , headed by Senator Homer E. Capehart , 1 Republican of Indiana , will hear . testimony from him at 10 A. M. On Tuesday , Senator Harry F. Byrd , Democrat of Virginia , plans to open hearings of the Joint Committee on Reduction of Nonessential Expenditures , which he heads . Mr. Byrd has said , and Mr. Cole agreed today , that the Senator had been investigating the situation for almost a year . Both groups will look into charges that builders made " windfall " profits through Government-insured loans that were larger than the actual cost of projects . The builders allegedly pocketed the difference . Mr. Cole has been assigned by the President to conduct the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in all fairness it must be added that the builder " had a right to outguess " the appraiser if he could . Under Section 608 of the Housing Act a person could build an apartment house and receive a mortgage up to 90 per cent of the estimated cost of construction . The section expired in 1950 but Title I , under which irregularities on repairs allegedly occurred , is still in effect . There was " nothing wrong , " Mr. Cole said , if a builder was so efficient that he built an apartment house at less cost than appraised or if a Federal Housing Administration agent made an honest overappraisal . But , he declared , in 251 cases the builders received " windfalls , " or unexpectedly high profits , of $75,000,000 . " That indicated either one of two things , " he asserted . " Either someone in the F. H. A. was grossly negligent in the Conduct of their business or that there was collusion on the part of some of tile people in F. H. A. and some builders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other phases of the Government 's housing program was raised by Richard L. Wilson of The Des Moines Register and Tribune and other Cowles publications . He asked : " Do you have any indication that there may be corruption in other phases of the housing pro-gram ? " Mr. Cole replied : " Yes , I do . " " What phases ? " Mr. Wilson asked . " I 'm not ready to talk about that yet . " Mr. Wilson asked at another point : " Is there any suggestion that anybody connected with this investigation has received - any money for favors ? " - " Yes , " Mr. Cole replied , but ' he declined to elaborate except to ' add that the accused had been told of the allegations . He also said that laxity or negligence had been indicated in the F. H. A. , which is a unit of the Housing and Home Finance Agency . Building Plan Spotlighted In November , 1953 , he declared , the Justice Department advised the F. H. A. that " a full investigation " should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency 's general counsel replied that records in the district attorney 's office had been scrutinized without showing any need for further investigation . " Some time later than that , " Mr. Cole reported , " the district attorney said that the F. H. A. investigators had not inspected the files and that they had 100 cases in their . files upon which complaint could be presented . " The reported scandal in the Government 's housing program , meanwhile , cast a shadow over the " lease-purchase " bill for Government buildings throughout the country . The bill , scheduled to come to a vote on Tuesday , would authorize a start on construction of Federal buildings by private builders on somewhat of an installment plan . Rent paid by the Government would be applied to the purchase price of new structures under leases of ten to twenty-five years . Limitations Sought Several members of the Senate , apparently with the housing disclosure in mind , have sought to place various limitations on the lease-purchase agreements . One amendment adopted on Thursday , for example , was that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Works Committee before becoming effective . After the " lease - purchase " measure , the Senate is expected to take up the wool bill . A strong movement has been under way to amend this measure to continue the present program of mandatory price supports at 90 per cent of parity . Parity is the theoretical price designed to give farmers a fair return for their products in relation to costs . The wool bill calls for production payments to sheep raisers , as against any extension of price support through Federal loans . A Treasury checx would go to the wool man to make up the difference between market prices and a fair return . The Administration favors a flexible farm support program . One measure the Administra- , tion wants  --  a wiretapping bill  --  I comes before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday . Attorney General Herbert Brownell ' Jr. , the first scheduled witness , is expected to renew his plea for the kind of measure the House has refused to pass . The bill that was approved by the House on April 8 provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General before the latter could authorize wiretapping in the prosecution of subversives . Mr. Brownell wanted the authority put in his own hands . Both these proposals , however , clash with a measure sponsored by Senator Pat McCarran of Nevada , the ranking Democrat on the full Judiciary Committee . The McCarran bill would outlaw wiretapping as such , though a court could authorize it for a limited time after a so-called certification of necessity from the Attorney General . It is unlike the House bill in another respect : it would not permit information gained by - taps to be submitted as evidence in court , but only for leads to locate possible evidence . On the other side of the Capitol , all will be quiet in the House chamber as the members take an Easter recess until April 26 . I There are several large appropriations measures to be completed , but so far the economyminded members have not made much of a record in cutting the Administration 's budget requests . The House , at about the midway point of this session , has considered requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while approving bills aggregating $11,500,000,000 . The chamber , which last year cut $2,900,000,000 from the same group of requests , still has to act on several major measures , including the defense and foreign aid appropriations . None of the appropriation bills has been acted on by the Senate .
