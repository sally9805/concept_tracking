Outside Washington , it might have been difficult last week to scratch up an argument on such momentous subjects as H-bomb fallout or trade with Red China , but nearly every mother 's son and every son 's mother had an opinion about the case of an American soldier facing trial in a Japanese court . It was not the first time a G.I. faced trial in a foreign court , nor would it be the last . Nonetheless , this was the case that caught the public ear and prompted the rumbling of the Public Voice on Capitol Hill . <P> Last Jan. 30 Army Specialist Third Class William S. Girard , 21 , fired an empty cartridge case from a grenade launcher to scare off several Japanese who were scavenging for metal on a U.S. rifle range near Tokyo ; he struck one woman in the back and killed her ( TIME , May 27 ) . The Army insisted that Girard fired while on duty ( technically he was guarding a machine gun between target practice sessions ) and was therefore subject to the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Japanese held that because Girard did not fire during official exercise , he was subject to Japanese justice .

Congressmen , from left to right , were hammering at the Dulles-Wilson ruling ; e.g. , Ohio 's Senator John Bricker accused the Government of " sacrificing an American soldier to appease Japanese public opinion . " Girard 's defense attorney , who was recommended for the job by the Hearst New York Journal-American , filed suit in U.S. District Court in Washington to have Girard brought back to the U.S. , announced plans to subpoena Dulles , Wilson and Army Secretary Wilber Brucker . The counterblasts were soon rolling in from all over Asia , where the Dulles-Wilson ruling had been hailed as a declaration that the U.S. was not a lordly , imperial-minded power .
