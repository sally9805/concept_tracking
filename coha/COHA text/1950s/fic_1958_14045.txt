When the curtain rises , a spot of light focuses on a man 's face . He sits alone in darkness at what may be a table , writing with a quill on a roll of papyrus . His clothes , as they gradually take on shape , are Roman  --  but this becomes apparent only after he has spoken two or three sentences . He is good-looking enough , intelligent , middle-aged . His name is Claudius , and he is robed in the imperial purple . CLAUDIUS Why does a stuttering , shambling , slew-footed idiot keep a diary ? ( He writes . ) What does it matter what happens to any blithering animal in this lop-faced world ? ( He writes . ) But I keep one . Faithfully . Write in it every night , big events , little doings , all higgledy-podge in together . " Today the slave brought me eggs for breakfast " ( He is reading. ) " and there is news that the Egyptian government has destroyed half the papyrus crop to keep up the price of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Margin . Margin of profit . Margin for error . But in a diary there 's no margin for error . Once done it 's done , and no correcting later . And as for profit  --  our only profit is finding out , when it 's too late , how we could have avoided what happened to us . ( He writes. ) p. 3 Rules for fools . Be careful what you wish for when you are young , for you may get it , when you no longer want it . Be careful what you hate , for hate has an odor , and the thing hated may smell you out .  --  I was a republican . I hated absolute power . I hated the empire . And the thing I hated smelled me out and hunted me down  --  and I must wear this .

If I had not lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I could not believe it ! After four hundred years of the republic , under a constitution put together expressly to make kings and dictators impossible , we have become an empire ! And I , one of those who fought it , sit here and curse myself  --  for I am the emperor ! ( He writes again . ) And a fool . A knock-kneed , blubber-tongued fool . And if I had not been thought a fool I would not have lived to wear this , ( He picks up the crown. ) this symbol of achievement and victory . Continue , worm . Keep a record of what you were . ( He writes . ) Even a worm wishes to live . Even a worm wishes , if possible , to live longer than his life . So he leaves a record , a sort of worm track , in his diary .

( He looks up. ) p. 4 Men will try again for freedom , in some other part of the earth . It 's gone here , gone for a thousand years , but men will try elsewhere and by that time maybe they will have changed , will be armed like the gods , able to hear and see as the gods hear and see , able to strike down as the gods strike , invisibly , from a distance . And they will arm themselves against kings and dictators , writing it in the laws , as we did , that no man may be absolute , that no rule shall extend beyond a certain term , that free men shall choose their own ways under equal laws .

And when such a man is very subtle , as Augustus was , who knows but he shall have his way ? ( The LIGHTS go out. ) @x In the year 6 A.D. , in the library of the palace of the Emperor Augustus of Rome , a myopic Greek slave named Olympus is deciphering the title on the end of a scroll from the cell in which it rested . We are in a corner of the library , which is walled with hexagonal cells like those of a honey-comb , for the storing of scrolls . Olympus has a ladder for climbing to the higher reaches of the walls , and he is standing on it now , poring over an illegible word . To the door comes another slave , Scipio , ushering in a youth of sixteen or so , who wears the recently-acquired dress of manhood . SCIPIO The Emperor Augustus wishes his grandson , Lucius Caesar , to wait in the library until he is ready to see him . OLYMPUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SCIPIO ( Approaching . ) Are you so blind , Olympus ? OLYMPUS No , but I do n't want children pawing over my manuscripts . Stay with him , will you ? SCIPIO Lucius is no child . He 's a man , wearing a man 's robe , fourteen years old ! p. 6 OLYMPUS They 're the worst . Will you stay ? SCIPIO I ca n't . There are five more coming . OLYMPUS Six hoodlums loose among my histories ! And the emperor ordered this ? LUCIUS ( Coming forward . ) Are you Olympus , the historian ? OLYMPUS I am Olympus the slave . LUCIUS You wrote the notes to my grandfather 's History of the Etruscan Religion ? OLYMPUS The notes are in Greek . LUCIUS Yes , I 'm familiar with your work . You have a rare gift for deciphering dead languages . Sabine . Etruscan . Oscan . I follow far behind you , but I do follow . SCIPIO I 'll leave you , sir . LUCIUS Yes , Scipio . ( Scipio goes . Olympus puts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see this library . What a weight of scrolls ! And all histories ? OLYMPUS All histories , sir . LUCIUS I 've seen only three volumes from it . My mother borrowed them for me , and of course I had to get them back within a limited time . OLYMPUS But you read them ? p. 7 LUCIUS Very carefully . Tell me , Olympus , why has my grandfather taken it upon himself to rewrite the history of the whole world ? OLYMPUS Has he , sir ? LUCIUS You know he has , for you 've done most of the rewriting yourself , I think . Why is he having it written ? OLYMPUS A slave can have no opinions , sir . LUCIUS Would a slave be interested in my opinion ? OLYMPUS It 's not safe to listen to critical remarks about the emperor , even though one does not share them . LUCIUS But I would n't dream of criticizing him ! It 's just that he wants to be sure only the truth is written down as history ! And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth ! OLYMPUS I beg your pardon ? LUCIUS I think you heard me . Only what the emperor thinks is the truth . Am I wrong ? OLYMPUS No . LUCIUS Of course not . Suppose I were to read in an old history that Julius Caesar was assassinated by patriots who wanted to rid the country of a tyrant . I might believe it . And that 's dangerous nonsense . The emperor is quite right to burn all those old histories and put new ones in place of them . And what 's to go in the new histories ? What the emperor wants in them ! Who else would know the truth ? Nobody . Let the emperor decide what happened . Anybody else could be mistaken , could set down something treasonous . But not Augustus . He could n't betray himself . And so he could n't be wrong . p. 8 OLYMPUS Your worship is pleased to be frivolous . LUCIUS Frivolous ! I 'm serious , Olympus ! Call me frivolous and you can be hung up by the thumbs ! I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your worship ! I agree . LUCIUS And even when he 's wrong , he 's right ! OLYMPUS Your worship is pleased to impale a slave on the horns of a dilemma . LUCIUS You feel yourself impaled ? OLYMPUS Have a little mercy , your worship . You are a grandson of the emperor . I am not free . LUCIUS Forgive me , Olympus . We 're joking , of course . OLYMPUS Very dangerous joking , my lord . I could die of it  --  for only listening . ( Lucius is suddenly serious . ) LUCIUS I trust you . One automatically trusts an intelligent man . OLYMPUS But that could be an error . Take care . LUCIUS Yes ? OLYMPUS For those who dislike tyranny this is a poor time to be born . We are going toward kings . LUCIUS The people of Rome will never accept a king . p. 9 OLYMPUS They won their freedom too long ago . Now they are used to it , care little about it , would rather eat well as slaves than starve as free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said too much . Better to read and be silent . LUCIUS True . ( There is a crash at the L. stage R. and Claudius , a boy of ten , enters immediately after , falling flat on his face as if he had tripped on the sill , his stick slapping the floor and skittering away from his hand . Germanicus , his brother , a lad of seventeen or eighteen , runs in after him and picks him up gently . ) GERMANICUS I 'm sorry , Claudius ! That was my fault ! I turned to look at the map , and let go of you suddenly ! CLAUDIUS ( Half-crying , getting up . ) N-n-no  --  it was m-m-my own c-c-clumsiness ! I tried to jump over the s-s-sill ! ( He gets up and limps angrily away . ) GERMANICUS You should n't try things like that . CLAUDIUS I k-n-n-ow . B-but I do . GERMANICUS No harm done , anyway .

LUCIUS Seems to be some kind of family session ! Anyway , my brothers and I were summoned . ( Lucius and Germanicus shake hands . ) Something tells me we 're going to hear words of wisdom from on high . GERMANICUS I shall try to keep a straight face . LUCIUS Do that . ( He turns to Claudius . ) I hear you 're turning into a student . CLAUDIUS I m-might as well . Ca n't run and ca n't talk . Might as we-well r-read . ( Two more boys enter from the L. ) LUCIUS Some time since you 've seen these brothers of mine , I think . GERMANICUS Caius ! Postumus ! ( He gives a hand to each as they come forward . Caius is older , Postumus younger than Lucius . ) CAIUS Germanicus ! you 've grown up ! GERMANICUS You 're tall enough for the army yourself ! p. 11 CAIUS I should be . I took a little turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GERMANICUS Under Tiberius ? CAIUS Yes . Under my stepfather , so I was a privileged character . It was a sort of vacation . And this is Claudius ? CLAUDIUS ( Taking his hand . ) Y-yes , sir . CAIUS Do n't " sir " me ! I 'm no officer ! CLAUDIUS B-but you 're big enough ! POSTUMUS Claudius and I are old friends . ( He puts an arm around Claudius . ) We attend the same gymnasium and spend our time evading all types of physical exercise ! ( Plancus , another slave , comes to the inner door . ) PLANCUS The lady Livia , the wife of Augustus , is about to enter . ( The boys range themselves facing the door . Plancus steps aside and Livia , with Drusus , a boy of seventeen or so , comes to the head of the steps . She is middle-aged , but still beautiful . On her left hand she wears a large red ring . She holds Drusus by the hand and brings him forward affectionately . The boys and the slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livia . ) LIVIA It always makes me feel so ridiculous when people kneel to me , and especially when my own grandsons go through these little ceremonies . But Augustus tells me that for the good of society and the preservation of manners we must retain the customs of our ancestors . So I may not protest . But do rise now and let me be your plain old grandmother among her handsome boys . p. 12 DRUSUS ( Rising , as they all do . ) You will never be plain , grandmother , and you are not old . LIVIA There 's my Drusus , the courtier always . My mirror tells me the truth about these things , but how we do love to be told our mirrors lie ! I am young for a grandmother , for I married at fifteen and my sons married young , but when I look around me here I am so proud of you all I 'm glad it happened as it did ! What more could any woman ask  --  what more could the gods grant ? Lucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . ) DRUSUS Do you wish to sit , Grandmother ? LIVIA Olympus will bring me one of his stools , so that I may sit here , and my golden six will sit around me on the floor , as they often have when I told them stories from history . ( Olympus brings a stool , Livia sits and the boys seat themselves about her . ) Oh , little Claudius , have I made it hard for you again ? CLAUDIUS No , it 's easy . LIVIA ( Offering grapes . ) Will you taste one of these ? CLAUDIUS I 'll pass them . LIVIA No , no , sit near me , so you can take my hand when the time comes to rise . And gather round close , for I love you all , and if I do n't kiss you all , but only blow kisses  --  ( She does so . The Slave passes the grapes. ) it 's because Augustus will enter behind me . We have n't much time , and I do want you to be patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loves you as I do , loves his step-grandchildren just as he loves his own , would rather hurt himself than hurt you . If he seems stern it 's because he has some ancient principle in mind , one of the laws brought down from Romulus and Remus . p. 13 LUCIUS Are you preparing us for something , Grandmother ? LIVIA Yes , Lucius . You are right . I must hurry . How can I say this ? ( She pauses , looking at them . ) Though we love each other , Augustus and I unhappily had no children together . He had one daughter by a former wife . I had two sons by a former husband . Caius , Lucius and Postumus here are the sons of Augustus ' daughter . Drusus , Germanicus , and little Claudius here , are the sons of my sons . You are the golden half-dozen . We have both loved you all equally . To one of you the imperial crown will descend . CLAUDIUS Are we then an empire , Grandmother ? LIVIA We have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are discussing it . Only you beg the question by assuming that we are already an empire . And when you say that one of us will inherit what has become a throne I am bound to say that I do not wish to inherit because I was opposed to setting up an empire in place of the Roman republic . LIVIA Oh , my dear Lucius , you are so headstrong . You must forever say the wrong thing even when it 's of the utmost importance to smooth things over and keep the peace  --  ! LUCIUS But , Grandmother , I do not want to smooth things over ! I want to say and I want it known that I intend to see the republic restored , that  --  p. 14 LIVIA Lucius ! LUCIUS Yes ? LIVIA You are a young man and I am only a woman . But we know that leaders of states quarrel over these matters , that blood is shed and men sometimes die for taking the wrong side . What I am trying to tell you is that I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to say the wrong thing to Augustus today , and perhaps anger him , for he has intense convictions about the state , convictions that can not be trifled with . LUCIUS I am not speaking lightly , Grandmother . The founders of our republic hated kings and dictators  --  and so do I ! CLAUDIUS A-a-and ss-s-o d-d-do  --  LIVIA ( Ignoring Claudius . ) Lucius , please  --  you must not say this to Augustus ! He comes here today with a message that will leave us no time for disputes over our form of government  --  He 's coming ! ( She rises . ) Please  --  be sweet , be patient , be reasonable ! And remember he is not as deaf as you think . Do not speak disrespectfully . He hears ! ( There is a stir in the hallway behind her , and Augustus , wearing the purple , walks slowly into view , accompanied by Two Guards and followed by Two Slaves carrying a chair . He is a lean quiet man , of a type that shows neither youth nor age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ear trumpet . The boys scramble to their feet and bow , Livia helping Claudius . Augustus stands a moment , observant. ) p. 15 AUGUSTUS No doubt you have prepared them for my coming , Livia ? LIVIA They 're good boys , Augustus . AUGUSTUS All children are good . Some are recalcitrant , but that 's good too . Rebellion is the duty of youth . It 's the motive power that turns the wheels of society . Rebellion , suppression , rebellion , suppression , that 's what makes the world go round . When we 're young we rebel , when we 're older we repress . I used to be a rebel . Now I 'm on the other side . But do not think for a moment that we are not pushing the same wheel . We are . And all going the same way . Forward . ( He pauses . ) But I came to tell you something , not to lecture you . LIVIA You must not tire yourself , Augustus ! Remember your chair ! AUGUSTUS You are right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and sits without looking , the Slaves placing the chair under him . ) Resume your places , young men , and , Livia , you must not stand . LIVIA Thank you . ( The boys and Livia sit as before . ) AUGUSTUS What I came to tell you is this . I must make sure that when I come to die our city of Rome is not torn with civil wars over the question of who will be my successor . Therefore , I must make the decision . As you know , my first choice was Livia 's son , Germanicus . He was a brilliant general , a popular man with the people , a natural leader . His death was a grief and a misfortune to all of us . Tiberius , Livia 's other son , is not popular and he has made himself personally disagreeable to me . He is not acceptable . That means I must look among you here , my six grandsons , for a successor . One of you will be chosen . I want you to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high an office . ( Germanicus rises . ) I will hear Germanicus , junior , my grandson . p. 16 GERMANICUS Sir , as you know , according to our constitution , there are other offices that must be held before one becomes consul . None of us is old enough even to be elected praetor  --  moreover , all these offices are elective , not appointive . AUGUSTUS What does he say ? LIVIA ( With the ear trumpet . ) They are not old enough under the constitution . AUGUSTUS There are ways . Rest easy . There are ways . LUCIUS I mean no disrespect , sir , but I feel very strongly that we should keep to the constitution ! It would be impossible for me to accept what you say about the succession . There can be no royal family in a republic  --  and we are a republic ! AUGUSTUS Yes , Livia ? LIVIA He has a natural respect for the constitution , but he is very angry at those who oppose your will ! ( Augustus smiles . ) LUCIUS That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please ! ( Lucius jumps to his feet . Livia tries to stop him . ) LUCIUS The Roman republic is four hundred years old ! Under it men are free , and kings are forbidden ! You sit where you are now illegally  --  without right ! A consul may not succeed himself and you have governed continuously since before I was born ! Every citizen of Rome is paid to vote for you , and paid enough so he can live without working ! You tax the provinces and pay the Romans to keep you in power ! Your whole empire is built on this corruption ! p. 17 AUGUSTUS Livia ? LIVIA He says there are many sly , hateful men who are demanding a return of the republic against your imperial will  --  LUCIUS No ! ( He steps near Augustus , who rises . ) I said I love freedom and hate despotism ! I 'm for the republic , and against tyranny ! And you have become a tyrant ! ( Augustus hears these last words and takes a step back . ) AUGUSTUS You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to you , Lucius . The Roman republic was good for its time , but it has outlived its usefulness . It is our destiny , here in Rome , to conquer the inhabited world , and to rule it . A republic can not take over the earth , can not rule subject peoples . For that we must become an empire . LUCIUS Why must we govern the earth ? AUGUSTUS To make ourselves secure and to keep universal peace . LUCIUS Yes  --  the peace of death ! AUGUSTUS Some must die , it is true , in order that we may have peace . I have a great deal to do , my child , in my one lifetime . I must make Italy an empire and make Rome all-powerful throughout the world . I must seek aid from those who are with me . I have no time for those who are against me . Which are you ? p. 18 LUCIUS I 'm for freedom , and the republic ! AUGUSTUS Then I 'm sorry , for I think you 're a likeable boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not well . We 'll postpone this business to another day . My physician is outside . LIVIA Yes , dear . ( She claps her hands , then takes his arm . A Little Man comes running in and takes his other arm . ) AUGUSTUS Are the boys all against me ? LIVIA No , no , dear . Of course not . AUGUSTUS ( To the Physician . ) It 's my dizziness again . Give me the capsule . I can swallow it . PHYSICIAN Yes , Augustus . ( He finds a pill for Augustus . ) AUGUSTUS ( Swallowing the pill . ) Lucius , are you firm in your opinion ? LUCIUS I am for the republic ! AUGUSTUS ( Putting a hand on Lucius ' shoulder . ) If there were only a capsule for that ! But there is none . ( He turns to go , looks down at Claudius . ) Who is this young one ? LIVIA This is Claudius , the younger brother of Germanicus. p. 19 AUGUSTUS He looks like a bright boy . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never ! ( She turns away . ) AUGUSTUS But , why not ? Tell me , Claudius  --  are you for the greatness of Rome or for the old republic ? CLAUDIUS I  --  I  --  I  --  d-d-d-do n't  --  like  --  I 'm for  --  ( He gasps . ) LIVIA He does n't know what he 's for . AUGUSTUS Yes , I see what you mean . ( He goes out with Livia and the Physician . Lucius sits on the stool . The Two Guards follow Augustus out . ) CLAUDIUS I hate empires and I love the republic ! GERMANICUS I do n't think he heard you , Claudius . CLAUDIUS I got it out anyway ! CAIUS Something wrong , brother ? LUCIUS Seem to have a little of that dizziness . GERMANICUS What 's the trouble , fellow ? LUCIUS Just  --  there 's a sharp pain in my left side  --  as if I 'd been running . ( He droops a little. ) p. 20 CAIUS Shall we get that doctor back ? ( Germanicus runs out . ) LUCIUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? LUCIUS I felt a  --  I do n't see very well  --  I felt a sort of sting in my arm  --  but I ca n't be sure when it happened . CAIUS Which arm ? LUCIUS This . ( He droops forward . ) CAIUS ( Baring the arm . ) Here ? LUCIUS It 's nothing , I know . CAIUS There 's no mark ! ( Lucius leans heavily on Caius . The Physician comes hurrying in with Livia and Germanicus . ) LIVIA Quick ! What has happened ? POSTUMUS It 's Lucius ! He was dizzy and then there was a pain in his arm . LIVIA See to him quickly ! ( The Physician comes forward and takes Lucius ' wrist , then looks at his eye . ) Lucius is never ill . Did he fall ? CAIUS No . LIVIA Pick him up and place him on the couch in the next room . ( Olympus and Scipio come forward . ) I shall look to him myself . Come , come , quickly . ( The Slaves take Lucius out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow. ) p. 21 CAIUS Germanicus ? GERMANICUS Yes ? CAIUS Where are you going ? GERMANICUS Someone should watch over him . CAIUS No worse can happen than has happened . He was dead when I held him in my arms . GERMANICUS How do you know ? CAIUS One knows a dead body from a living one . He was poisoned . It 's not safe to say the wrong thing .  --  Stay with us here . Let 's keep together . We 're none of us safe now . GERMANICUS ( Coming back . ) How do you know he was poisoned ? ( The group draws together as if afraid of the outside world . ) CAIUS I 've seen these symptoms before . GERMANICUS In whom ? CAIUS My father . Augustus wished to be rid of him . DRUSUS You think  --  Augustus  --  ? CAIUS Yes . POSTUMUS If I were sure it  --  was  --  Augustus  --  I would kill him ! CAIUS If you did n't kill him I would . p. 22 GERMANICUS And I. DRUSUS And I. Whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed him . CLAUDIUS Only w-we  --  m-must be certain first ! DRUSUS Yes , Claudius , we must be certain . We 're not even sure Lucius was poisoned . CAIUS I 'm sure . I saw my father die . It happened this same way . A sudden dizziness , a pain in his arm , no mark they could find . DRUSUS But was there anything to connect Augustus with the death of your father ? CAIUS Augustus was one of the consuls that year . My father Agrippa was the other . Since then Augustus has had it all to himself . CLAUDIUS ( Who has been sobbing quietly . ) Wh-why-why  --  sh-sh-should he kill Lucius ? GERMANICUS Lucius spoke out . The rest of us were silent . CAIUS That 's true . GERMANICUS Why was I silent ? Why did n't I speak out ? I hate the Empire as he did . DRUSUS Augustus will name one of us Emperor . POSTUMUS There must not be an Emperor . p. 23 DRUSUS Let us swear revenge on the man that killed Lucius  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us swear to avenge my brother 's death  --  the four of us  --  CLAUDIUS F-f-five . CAIUS Right , Claudius ! Five . Let us swear silently . By whatever Gods we worship . DRUSUS We will find the murderer and kill him . CAIUS When we have killed him we must restore the Republic . ( Livia returns , weeping . ) LIVIA Lucius , my handsome Lucius . One of our hopes . One of our dearest hopes . He was so young and handsome No tears among you . POSTUMUS We loved him too . LIVIA You do not weep for him ? ( They are silent . ) The audience is ended . ( One by one the boys kiss her hand and go  --  Claudius last . She looks after him with a motherly , pitying smile . ) CURTAIN p. 24 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ISCENE 2 It is morning on a sunny spring day in the year 14 A.D. , and we are in the peristyle of Augustus ' palace in Rome .

Steps lead up to the rooms in the rear , and there are beds of flowers in the C. of the court with benches about them . An ornamented bell , with a rope dangling from it , hangs from a column . A fig tree and an orange tree , bearing fruit , grow among the pillars . The cracking of a whip sounds like a series of shots from stage R. , and two black slaves in flashing livery run in with a roll of purple carpet on their shoulders . An overseer follows with whip cracking behind him . They unroll the carpet on the steps to the women 's quarters and then go on through to stage L.

They are proud , self-conscious , but self-possessed . ) Turn around . ( The girls revolve before the women . ) LIVIA Which do you think , Canidia ? p. 27 CANIDIA I think he will like the little one . LIVIA A King 's daughter for the ruler of the world . A good choice . I have sometimes wondered why the Greeks have no shame about disrobing in front of strangers . CANIDIA Barbarians . Beef . LIVIA They are educated . They read . They are taught to sing and dance .

( He kisses her . ) LIVIA Well , here we are , in Rome and it 's morning . AUGUSTUS I shall have breakfast . LIVIA Canidia has brought these for tonight . ( She indicates the slaves . ) AUGUSTUS What an entrancing morning , now that you speak of it ! The sunlight on those delicate columns !

For one , I have been looking into the trial of my grandson , Postumus , and I fear there was perjury there . LIVIA But that is not possible . He was found guilty ! Guilty of rape ! The rape of a noblewoman ! AUGUSTUS The woman was not raped . She was bribed and she lied . LIVIA Who could have done such a thing ? AUGUSTUS I do n't know . LIVIA Tell them to dress , Canidia .

I feel no pain , yet this growing weakness  --  LIVIA Well , you eat nothing  --  AUGUSTUS Everything seems to disagree with me . And my hands tremble . I must be getting old . LIVIA It could be weakness from hunger . ( Dirce finds Canidia 's tablet and stylus and slips them into her robe . At the moment when she is hiding them Augustus happens to notice her . She has the robe only partly adjusted . ) AUGUSTUS That one . Let me see that one . I did n't notice her before . LIVIA Ah  --  you recover ! The farthest from us ? AUGUSTUS Yes . LIVIA Her name is Dirce. p. 30 AUGUSTUS You have spoken to her ? LIVIA Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUGUSTUS What king ? LIVIA King Hylas . AUGUSTUS Let me see you , Dirce . LIVIA Come here , Dirce . Augustus wishes to see you . ( Dirce comes toward them . ) Take off the robe . ( She takes off the robe and holds it on her arm . ) Turn . ( She does so . Canidia comes in with a platter of bread . ) AUGUSTUS Send her to me tonight . LIVIA Let her use the interior bath and my perfume . CANIDIA Yes , mistress . LIVIA What will you do  --  about Postumus ? AUGUSTUS I shall bring Postumus home . I was about to send instructions for his return . And suddenly the name of the island went out of my mind . I got up to look around , thinking it would come to me , but it has n't . It 's embarrassing . Where 's Olympus ? LIVIA In the library , no doubt . Shall we call him ? AUGUSTUS Yes , call him . p. 31 LIVIA Chaerea , go to the library and call Olympus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library . ) AUGUSTUS I seem to remember badly today . Names go out of my mind . LIVIA ( To Dirce . ) Put on your robe and retire to a respectful distance . ( Chaerea enters the library . ) DIRCE Yes , mistress . ( She dons the robe and sits on a step in the rear . ) CHAEREA ( Calling from within the library . ) Olympus ! AUGUSTUS What is it that happens to a man 's heart and brain  --  or to his soul , his psyche  --  when he has made himself all-powerful ? When he can say of any man , let him die , or any woman , I will have her tonight , and his command is obeyed ? It changes him  --  and not for the better . I 'm weary . LIVIA You did n't do it for yourself . Put your head down . AUGUSTUS No , I did it for Rome . Yet sometimes I doubt that it has been good for Rome . ( He stretches out , his head in her lap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 AUGUSTUS And governs it well , yes . But the people of the city have changed . They are like spoiled children . Nobody wants to work . Everyboy wants to be taken care of . And they have become cruel . They do not love justice . LIVIA You have spoiled the people and shown them too much mercy . AUGUSTUS Sometimes I have had to be unjust in small things to achieve justice in larger matters . And this is an evil . LIVIA History will not say it was evil . AUGUSTUS Why ? LIVIA There was chaos all round the Mediterranean , and you made order here  --  you put the whole world in order . Men can live quietly in their homes . There is peace only when there is power . AUGUSTUS And yet  --  I do not like the change  --  in the people . They no longer care for freedom . And in my secret heart I feel a rot beginning . In fact , I have become  --  a sort of horror inside  --  a horror to myself . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't despise . LIVIA Augustus ! AUGUSTUS I have been cruel to you , too , Livia . I have done things that could not fail to hurt you . I have been unfaithful to you so often that it becomes a routine . p. 33 LIVIA You have done no wrong . AUGUSTUS Whatever I did  --  there was no pleasure in it  --  LIVIA None ? In all those beautiful girls I found you ? AUGUSTUS None . Except in you . Except in our love . CHAEREA ( Coming out of the library . ) Olympus ! OLYMPUS ( Coming from the atrium . ) Yes ! ( Augustus sits up . ) CHAEREA The emperor wants you . LIVIA Our palace has the homeliest , plainest manners in the whole city . Ca n't they learn to speak more respectfully of you ? AUGUSTUS Let it be as it is . I like all things about me to be plain and unpretentious . I do not even wish to be called the emperor . CANIDIA ( To the Slave Girls as she goes . ) Come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIVIA Why ? AUGUSTUS I just wish to see her . ( Canidia goes out with the other girls , leaving Dirce . Olympus comes to Augustus . ) Olympus , there 's a map of the Mediterranean Sea in some volume or other in the library , and I want to consult it . p. 34 OLYMPUS Sir , there is a map of the Sea in the official history of the conquest  --  AUGUSTUS That 's the one  --  OLYMPUS But at the moment it is not in the library . AUGUSTUS Has someone been making free with my books ? OLYMPUS I believe you gave Claudius leave to read there , sir . AUGUSTUS Claudius ? Has he been reading histories ? OLYMPUS And he sometimes takes them to his room . AUGUSTUS I must see that volume . OLYMPUS Yes , master . I 'll find him . ( Dirce , left alone , has sat on a step and written on one of the leaves of Canidia 's tablet . Olympus goes out stage R. ) AUGUSTUS In some ways I 've been a most unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter exiled , for adultery . And two of my grandsons dying  --  Lucius  --  and then Caius . Postumus must be brought home at once ! Thank the Gods he is still alive ! LIVIA You do n't speak of my son . AUGUSTUS Tiberius is returning today as you wished , but he is not to be trusted , Livia . My work is not finished , and if I were to die soon , I would n't want to leave the empire in his hands . p. 35 LIVIA Poor dear , you brood over such morbid notions ! Always thinking about dying . AUGUSTUS I have to . It 's part of my job . I 've also sent for Germanicus and Drusus . LIVIA Then it can be settled while they are all here . AUGUSTUS It will be settled , always remembering that nothing is final . Here 's Claudius . ( Claudius , a diffident young man in his twenties , comes in from stage R. , limping slightly . Olympus is with him . Claudius carries a scroll . ) LIVIA Poor boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have the book , Claudius . CLAUDIUS Y-y-y-y  --  I 'm  --  sorry  --  AUGUSTUS You probably mean yes . Never mind . Let me have it . ( Claudius hands it over . ) I 'm just looking for the map of the Mediterranean . You may go , Olympus . CLAUDIUS Th-th-there i-i-i-is no  --  AUGUSTUS ( Studying the scroll . ) What 's that ? ( Olympus goes out . ) CLAUDIUS There is n-n-no  --  m-m-m  --  p. 36 AUGUSTUS Let me find out for myself . LIVIA This is too painful . I 'll leave you . ( She rises . ) AUGUSTUS No , stay ! ( Livia sits again . ) But there is no map in this volume ? CLAUDIUS N-n-n-n  --  LIVIA Claudius , I have often noticed that stuttering and other defects of speech are traceable to disturbed emotions ! Pull yourself together ! Make a determined effort ! Speak . CLAUDIUS There is no map in this volume ! There were three copies of the official history in the library , and one of them contained a map of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last campaign ! LIVIA You see ! You can speak perfectly well ! AUGUSTUS So Tiberius borrowed it ? CLAUDIUS Yes , sir . AUGUSTUS Well , I was just looking up the names of some islands , and I can call on my geographer , of course  --  CLAUDIUS If I could help you , sir  --  AUGUSTUS You ? CLAUDIUS It happens I have just been reading about our island possessions  --  p. 37 AUGUSTUS You say you 've been reading history ? CLAUDIUS Y-y-y-y , n-n-n  --  ( He stops . ) AUGUSTUS I see , a brief flare-up of clarity , followed by the darkness of incoherence . That will be all , Claudius . I 'll keep the book . CLAUDIUS ( Desperately . ) B-but  --  I  --  I  --  know the n-n-names ! AUGUSTUS You know them ? CLAUDIUS Y-y-y-y  --  Oh , God ! AUGUSTUS Are you afraid of me , Claudius ? ( Silence . ) Are you afraid of me ? CLAUDIUS N-n-n  --  LIVIA Speak slowly , Claudius . CLAUDIUS T-th-th  --  AUGUSTUS Stop . I 'll make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . Yes . Name me the main islands of the Western Mediter-ranean . Name me those islands without stuttering , pausing or breaking down , and I will  --  he can have ten thousand sesterces to do with as he pleases . Now , then . ( A silence . Claudius tries to speak but ca n't . ) LIVIA The boy 's a fool , Augustus , and always has been ! A hopeless fool . p. 38 AUGUSTUS Try once more , Claudius . A man must speak  --  CLAUDIUS I  --  uh  --  uh  --  uh , God  --  d-d-d  --  AUGUSTUS You should at least swear without stuttering ! ( There is a trumpet call outside and shouts . ) LIVIA Tiberius is here . ( She goes out . ) AUGUSTUS Yes . You know them  --  say them . ( Claudius can not speak . Augustus goes out . Claudius finds himself alone with Dirce . He goes toward stage R. dejectedly . Dirce drops a piece of folded papyrus in his path . He picks it up , opens it , reads a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you read Greek ? CLAUDIUS Yes . I wish I could help you . I 'm no help to anybody  --  You heard this last fizzle . DIRCE Why do you do that ? CLAUDIUS I 've done it all my life . DIRCE Not now . CLAUDIUS It comes and goes . Do n't count on it . Do n't count on anything . I do n't . ( He starts to go . ) DIRCE Wait . ( He pauses. ) p. 39 CLAUDIUS N-n-n  --  DIRCE Do n't try to speak if it 's difficult . It may be that you ca n't help me . And if you could , why should you ? I 'm a slave , captured in a minor rebellion and you are one of the Masters of the world . CLAUDIUS Hardly . Where was the rebellion ? DIRCE In Crete . CLAUDIUS You were captured there ? DIRCE No . I was captured near Corsica . My father fled west across the water with my mother and me and the men of his crew . We thought we 'd escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset . But Rome is everywhere . We were picked up by a Roman galley . CLAUDIUS How did it come there ? DIRCE Oh , Rome is thorough . When a subject is exiled to a certain spot the patrols come around periodically to make sure the exile is still there . Unfortunately , a man had been banished to this island where we hoped we 'd be safe . We were picked up by the soldiers and brought to Rome . The arresting officer made an extra profit by selling us as slaves . CLAUDIUS What was the name of the island ? DIRCE I do n't know . CLAUDIUS But it was near Corsica ? p. 40 DIRCE Yes . CLAUDIUS What did the officer look like  --  the one who came to inspect ? DIRCE Tall , thin , ugly  --  with pustules on his face . CLAUDIUS Did he wear black patches over the sores to conceal them ? And white powder ? DIRCE Yes . CLAUDIUS That was Tiberius . And the exile must have been Postumus . ( There is a burst of trumpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) DIRCE Postumus ? CLAUDIUS A grandson of Augustus . A friend of mine . You bring me the first news I 've had of him since he was sent to that desert place . Did you see him ? Was he well ? DIRCE He was well enough until the man you call Tiberius came . Tiberius removed the guards , removed the servants and left him alone on the island , without food . CLAUDIUS But he 'll starve . DIRCE I think that 's what the officer had in mind . It will take a little time , for there may be shell fish among the rocks . CLAUDIUS Tiberius could be next in line for the empire  --  if he could get some others out of the way ! p. 41 DIRCE He brought bad luck to me . CLAUDIUS He takes bad luck wherever he goes ! ( He looks at the note . ) You want me to help you . I ca n't help anybody . I ca n't help Postumus off that island ! I 'd help you if I could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you buy me from Augustus ? CLAUDIUS I have nothing . I 'm nobody . DIRCE You 're one of the princes here . One of his grandsons . CLAUDIUS How do you know that ? DIRCE The slaves know all these things . They told me . CLAUDIUS One of the grandsons , you mean , who might inherit ? That 's a doubtful blessing . You see , there were six grandsons . And one by one we 're being killed . Lucius first , then Caius , now Postumus . Germanicus and Drusus have been away at the front enlarging the empire and the only reason I have n't been touched is that I 'm a stuttering imbecile . DIRCE Do you sometimes stutter more than necessary ? CLAUDIUS What do you mean ? DIRCE Is n't it safer to look a fool if you 're a grandson of the emperor ? CLAUDIUS I 'm fool enough without trying . p. 42 DIRCE But who commits the murders ? CLAUDIUS We do n't know . We see it happening . We see it coming , but we ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters alone in some haste from stage L. and is about to pass through on his way to the library when he notices Claudius . The two guards are with Augustus . ) AUGUSTUS Oh , Claudius  --  your uncle has just arrived and is coming down the street with his escort  --  CLAUDIUS My uncle ? AUGUSTUS Tiberius . Also  --  there 's something I very much want to take care of before I speak to him . If you happen to have those islands at your tongue 's end , the offer I made still holds . CLAUDIUS Oh . AUGUSTUS You do n't . Very well . ( He goes on . ) CLAUDIUS The main islands of the Western M-M-M-Me-Mediterranean are : Sicily , Sardinia , Corsica , Minorca , Mallorca and Ibiza . ( Augustus pauses . ) AUGUSTUS Of course . That brings it back . Ask for the reward whenever you want it . ( He comes back a step . ) Perhaps you 'd better ask soon . Few emperors live long . And I have a suspicion there are some about who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could I ask my reward now ? AUGUSTUS I 'm somewhat in a hurry . CLAUDIUS Let me have this slave and the debt is cancelled . AUGUSTUS Which is she ? CLAUDIUS She was chosen for you for tonight . AUGUSTUS Oh , yes . Yes . Take her . Say nothing to Livia . CLAUDIUS No , sir . ( Augustus goes out , followed by the Two Guards . ) DIRCE But you will have to tell her . Where could I stay ? CLAUDIUS Where were you before ? DIRCE The slave 's quarters . I 'd never see you again . ( There is a trumpet call , and a cheer , stage R. ) CLAUDIUS My room ? DIRCE Is it safe ? CLAUDIUS No , nothing 's safe , but it 's down that way . Third door to the left . ( He points to stage L. ) A little room with a bed and a chair covered with scrolls . Curl up small . Pretend you 're a scroll . DIRCE I ca n't thank you . You paid too much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave . DIRCE I 'm grateful . ( She suddenly throws her arms round him and kisses him . He responds awkwardly , for he hears steps entering from the atrium , stage R. Two men enter . They are Germanicus and Drusus , some years older , but recognizable . ) GERMANICUS ( Coming forward , embracing Claudius . ) But isnt this rather new for you ? CLAUDIUS Germanicus ! Drusus ! I did n't know you were coming ! DRUSUS I 'm sure you did n't . ( The slaves with purple carpet run in again . Dirce runs out . ) CLAUDIUS You 've been away three years , both of you ! ( The slaves begin to unroll the carpet on the steps to stage R. ) DRUSUS Seems longer , Claudius . It 's good to see you . CLAUDIUS How did you get here ? GERMANICUS It was a summons , for me . I have n't had a chance to talk with Drusus . DRUSUS Oh , I 'm here on order . And so is my father , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate theatres of war . Tiberius was commanding in Spain , Drusus was dealing with a rebellion in the Greek Islands and I was putting the Balkans in order . And to each of us came the word of Augustus  --  " Home , lad , I want to talk to you . " He must be worried about the succession again . p. 45 DRUSUS Or perhaps it 's time for another of us to die . CLAUDIUS Our band of five is reduced to three . DRUSUS Where 's Postumus ? ( He looks toward the slaves . ) CLAUDIUS You heard of his exile . DRUSUS Only that . GERMANICUS Is there more ? CLAUDIUS Right now he seems to be marooned on a barren island , without food . GERMANICUS When did you hear this ? CLAUDIUS This moment . I heard it from a slave . GERMANICUS One who had been there ? CLAUDIUS Yes . DRUSUS Postumus was n't guilty . He was put on that island because someone wanted him out of the way . CLAUDIUS Yes . DRUSUS But who would connive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLAUDIUS The same person who killed Lucius  --  and then Caius ? GERMANICUS That 's always been the question . They keep us away from Rome , Drusus and I , building the empire , slamming ahead from one campaign to another , no time to think  --  sometimes I wonder if I 'm there so I wo n't make trouble here at home . p. 46 DRUSUS But Postumus was very close to Augustus . GERMANICUS He was also for the Republic , as we all are . Perhaps once , he spoke too loudly . DRUSUS I have believed Augustus guilty . There are others who could be  --  but he comes first to mind . It is his Empire . He wants most to preserve it . GERMANICUS But he says he loves justice  --  and he seems to . ( The noise of Tiberius ' triumph is approaching . ) CLAUDIUS Who else could it be ? GERMANICUS ( Looking at the slaves . ) This is no place for a conference . And Tiberius is arriving . ( The slaves go out . ) DRUSUS Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might profit if the six of us were out of the way . My father would . Tiberius . It 's the only way he could ever become Emperor . GERMANICUS This is not safe . ( He looks about . ) DRUSUS There 's nobody listening . My father may have imperial ambitions . I 've sometimes thought so . CLAUDIUS Could he do a thing of that sort ? DRUSUS If he had a hope of absolute power  --  I would n't trust him . p. 47 GERMANICUS The terrible thing is I would n't trust anybody who had a hope of absolute power . CLAUDIUS Do you mean those who are left now suspect each other ? DRUSUS No , but I have suspected Tiberius . This is a terrible thing for a son to say about a father . And mind you , I do n't know that he 's done anything wrong . But he could do it . GERMANICUS Anybody could do it . I 've been away so long  --  isolated from everything except war  --  I do n't know what 's been going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLAUDIUS I asked the slave to describe the officer who came with the new orders for Postumus . The description was an exact picture of Tiberius . DRUSUS He gave the order to starve Postumus ? CLAUDIUS It 's the word of a slave ! And there 's nothing proved , of course !  --  If Tiberius were to have a hope of succeeding Augustus , would n't he have to murder all of us who are left ? Postumus , Germanicus and Drusus ? GERMANICUS And you , Claudius . Do n't forget yourself . ( A slave slips in from the library and listens behind a pillar . ) CLAUDIUS N-n-not m-m-me ! Germanicus , could we rescue Postumus ? p. 48 GERMANICUS Rescue him ? CLAUDIUS He 's on that island . Starving . GERMANICUS I wonder how we 'd go about it . The empire has taken root . It 's almost impossible to act against it . How do we begin to cut it back ? I do n't know where to begin . CLAUDIUS Do you have an army somewhere ? GERMANICUS I left my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GERMANICUS Yes . CLAUDIUS Could n't you take a few chosen men and make a raid on the island  --  carry Postumus off ? You pay them . You divide the spoils after a victory . They will do what you ask them . GERMANICUS That could be done  --  but we 'd never dare come home , of course , either Postumus or me . We 'd be fugitives the rest of our lives . CLAUDIUS It would mean you gave up the succession . GERMANICUS I would n't want to be Emperor . I have n't changed there . I 'd fight for the Republic if I saw any chance of winning . I 'd rescue Postumus if I could see any future afterward  --  for him or for me . CLAUDIUS If we 'd acted before when we swore our oath , Caius would not be dead and Postumus would not be exiled . p. 49 GERMANICUS But it would be open defiance of Augustus . He 'd put us to death if he caught us . CLAUDIUS We do n't know who would put us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he gets no help ! DRUSUS He 's right , Germanicus . CLAUDIUS Would you join us , Drusus ? Suppose we came back to Rome and offered the people freedom ? GERMANICUS With Augustus still in power ? He 'd never allow it ! CLAUDIUS The people might rise against him ! DRUSUS What people ? The slaves and the fawning men of Rome  --  all those who might oppose the Empire have been dead for years  --  and with Augustus ' soldiers patrolling the streets ? GERMANICUS The people have shown no desire to rise against Augustus . Bribery is very effective . He feeds them and entertains them . If there is trouble , they are afraid they may lose even that . CLAUDIUS Germanicus , could you give me a few soldiers and let me lead them ? GERMANICUS To that island ? CLAUDIUS Yes . GERMANICUS I could n't let you go alone . But I 'm damned if I 'll let Postumus die there if I can save him ! We 'll try it together . Where we 'll go afterward I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free men . Suppose the whole country rose  --  and went back to the Republic  --  voted in a new regime ! It 's one chance in a thousand , but it could happen ! p. 50 CLAUDIUS We may just get ourselves killed  --  but it might be better to die  --  together rather than separately . DRUSUS Four of us . Do n't leave me out . CLAUDIUS Not if you want to come , Drusus . But you do have to think of your father . DRUSUS Not now . We are on opposite sides . CLAUDIUS Mind you . I ca n't swear to the evidence against him . DRUSUS Could I speak with that slave ? GERMANICUS And could I ? ( There is another bugle call and a trampling of feet in the atrium . ) CLAUDIUS Come with me . ( Claudius , Drusus and Germanicus go out stage L. Plancus and another slave enter from stage R. on either side of the carpet . Tiberius followed by Two Centurions , comes in by the carpeted stairs . Livia enters . Tiberius is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches on his face to conceal skin eruptions . ) LIVIA Tiberius , my son , my son ! It 's good to have you home ! TIBERIUS You do n't change , Mother . LIVIA You do . So grave , so stern , so military ! p. 51 TIBERIUS I 've been called other things ! LIVIA Has all gone well ? TIBERIUS Spain is quiet again . Why was I recalled after all these years ? LIVIA ( Looking around . ) To celebrate a triumph . TIBERIUS My first . LIVIA You will have others . Soon . You are needed here now . ( Drusus enters from stage L. , followed by Germanicus and Claudius . ) Ah , the boys are here . TIBERIUS Is that my Drusus ? DRUSUS Yes , Father . TIBERIUS Come here , my son . ( Drusus goes to Tiberius . ) It 's been four years . And you 've led armies and won victories . ( Tiberius embraces Drusus . ) DRUSUS You 've been doing the same . TIBERIUS For me it 's an old story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have n't . ( He kneels at Livia 's feet and kisses her hand . She pulls him up and kisses him . ) LIVIA My courteous grandson , as of old . p. 52 DRUSUS And here are Germanicus , Father , and Claudius . TIBERIUS Of course , Germanicus . ( He goes to Germanicus and takes his hand . ) The most famous general in the empire . GERMANICUS Except yourself , sir . TIBERIUS Do n't be modest . I 've heard your exploits . GERMANICUS The world knows yours . ( He goes to Livia . ) My best greetings , Grandmother . ( He kisses her hand , but without kneeling . ) LIVIA You do n't kneel , sir ! ( She smiles . ) GERMANICUS I 'd forgotten that they kneel to you in Rome . TIBERIUS ( Looking at Claudius . ) And this is  --  ? CLAUDIUS C-c-c  --  excuse me ! TIBERIUS Ah  --  Claudius , of course . ( He smiles pityingly . ) CLAUDIUS N-n-n-no  --  off  --  TIBERIUS Never mind . Do n't explain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 53 DRUSUS We have n't seen him yet . CLAUDIUS He  --  he 's  --  he  --  ( He points toward the library . ) LIVIA Oh , he 's in the library . ( She starts toward it . ) GERMANICUS Shall I tell him we 're here ? LIVIA No , I want to speak to him . ( She goes into the library . ) DRUSUS You 've been in Spain , Father ? TIBERIUS Yes , my son . The last year . DRUSUS Did you return by land or sea ? TIBERIUS By sea this time . DRUSUS Did you touch anywhere on the way home ? TIBERIUS No  --  no stops . DRUSUS There are so many beautiful islands . You could have put in at Corsica . TIBERIUS We did n't . I was in a hurry to get home . ( There is a slight pause . Drusus glances toward Claudius , who turns at once . ) CLAUDIUS If y-y-y  --  DRUSUS Surely , Claudius . ( Claudius hurries out stage L. ) p. 54 GERMANICUS Somebody was telling me today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in from Spain . It was n't your convoy that brought them ? TIBERIUS I came with a single ship . And we brought no slaves . GERMANICUS No , I was mistaken , anyway . They were not Spanish girls . They were from Crete . TIBERIUS My bark has only just arrived at Ostia , with no slaves , Cretan or Spanish . Am I being questioned ? ( He smiles . ) DRUSUS Of course not , Father . But  --  beautiful slaves are always in demand . And  --  we had heard this rumor . ( Claudius comes to stage L. with Dirce . She looks at Tiberius . ) TIBERIUS What rumor ? DRUSUS About the girls . ( Dirce , looking at Tiberius , nods her head . Tiberius sees her with Claudius , takes a deep breath . ) GERMANICUS For myself , I 'm not deeply interested in the slaves . I 'm very much concerned , and I think Drusus is , about Postumus . TIBERIUS ( Calm . ) Have you heard from him , or about him ? DRUSUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 TIBERIUS Yes , Drusus . ( He looks toward the library . ) I wonder what 's happened to Livia and Augustus . GERMANICUS They 'll be along , no doubt . TIBERIUS I think I 'll  --  ( He starts toward the library . ) GERMANICUS If you do n't mind , sir , I 'd like to discuss the question of what 's happened to Postumus a little further  --  ( He edges between Tiberius and the exit . ) TIBERIUS We 'll drop the subject , I think . GERMANICUS This is a very serious matter for me , sir . TIBERIUS Perhaps more serious than you know ! GERMANICUS Have you reason for wanting to drop it ? TIBERIUS I know nothing about it ! DRUSUS We have reason to think you do , Father . TIBERIUS Yes ? What reason ? DRUSUS Have you seen Postumus recently ? TIBERIUS Why do you ask ? DRUSUS You took some prisoners on an island near Corsica and they have been sold as slaves in Rome . They saw you there . p. 56 TIBERIUS You take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is who visited that island and left Postumus worse off than when he came ! TIBERIUS ( Angry . ) Do you take the slaves ' word or mine ? GERMANICUS You would be wise not to touch your weapon , Tiberius . We are younger than you , and we are two to one . TIBERIUS You would kill your own father over an exile ? DRUSUS We want to know what 's happened to him ! TIBERIUS Very well ! Ask ! GERMANICUS What happened on that island ? Is Postumus still there ? TIBERIUS ( Conceding with a shrug . ) He is still there . GERMANICUS In what condition ? TIBERIUS His health appears excellent . GERMANICUS Were you acting under orders ? TIBERIUS I was . GERMANICUS Orders from whom ? TIBERIUS From Rome . GERMANICUS From Augustus ? p. 57 TIBERIUS From the Senate . GERMANICUS The senate does what Augustus wishes . DRUSUS Postumus is alive ? TIBERIUS He is . DRUSUS But you left him there to starve . TIBERIUS I am a soldier ! I took orders ! As you all do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the senate  --  and that means orders from the Emperor ! DRUSUS When Augustus takes his strangle-hold from the empire , we will restore the republic and we need Postumus to help us . TIBERIUS The republic is dead ! Oh , you fools , you young fools ! Some day one of you will be the emperor . GERMANICUS None of us will be emperor . ( To Drusus and Claudius . ) Then Augustus was guilty of all those deaths . CLAUDIUS It seems so . DRUSUS He gave the order . ( Augustus enters from the library , a paper in his hand , a secretary at his side . ) AUGUSTUS I wish to reverse this edict ! I have been studying the records , and there was perjury in the case against Postumus ! I hereby revoke the exile . Send for him ! Bring him home ! p. 58 LIVIA ( Entering behind Augustus . ) Tiberius ! Augustus is ill ! Germanicus , bring his physician ! Plancus will know where he is !

I will not sit ! I will dispose of this standing ! ( He sees Germanicus . ) Germanicus , Tiberius , I summoned you to discuss the succession , but that will have to wait until Postumus returns .

( Drusus runs in from stage L. , followed by the Physician and Plancus. ) p. 59 LIVIA Dear , you are not strong enough  --  AUGUSTUS I want this carried out at once ! I want Postumus brought back and restored to his rights and property ! LIVIA Yes , yes  --  later ! AUGUSTUS The exile ends as of today ! GERMANICUS We have just heard from Tiberius that Postumus has been left without food on a barren island , and condemned to die there ! AUGUSTUS Who did this ? TIBERIUS I did , sir . AUGUSTUS On whose orders ? TIBERIUS By decree of the senate . AUGUSTUS I knew nothing of it ! I did not sign it ! ( He finds that he must sit , and sinks into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was false testimony at his trial . And now  --  he  --  Who  --  did  --  this  --  ? Who gave that order ? ( He finishes , gasping . ) I must not let myself grow angry ! LIVIA Sweet , you are not strong enough ! Let it go till tomorrow ! AUGUSTUS No ! We must send quickly and save him ! ( He brushes his hand before his face , as if to clear away clouds . The slaves and servants have clustered in doorways , silent . Canidia appears. ) p. 60 CANIDIA ( Touching Dirce 's shoulder . ) You ! Where have you been ? CLAUDIUS ( Whispering across the room . ) Do n't touch her ! ( Dirce shrinks back . Canidia holds her . ) AUGUSTUS ( Looking . ) I gave that slave to  --  one  --  of the  --  one of them .  --  Postumus . Was it Postumus ? No , no . DIRCE You gave me to Claudius , sir ! AUGUSTUS That 's true . I gave her to Claudius for value received . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Let him keep the girl ! ( Canidia releases Dirce and she goes to Claudius . ) And now bear with me . I am not young , and I feel a great weakness in my body . I want to use what strength I have left to search out this evil that I have allowed to be done in my name . If you will all leave me , save Livia , I will call you back when I know the answer . Leave me . ( Silently , the slaves in the doorways first , the gathering disperses , leaving Augustus alone with Livia and Tiberius . ) Livia , bring me all the papers that have to do with the charges against Postumus . Tiberius ! TIBERIUS Yes , sir . AUGUSTUS Order a ship instantly to bring Postumus home ! p. 61 TIBERIUS Yes , sir . ( He hesitates . ) LIVIA You are not strong enough for this , Augustus . AUGUSTUS We shall see . The ship , Tiberius . ( Tiberius goes out . ) Livia . LIVIA I will not bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUGUSTUS Livia , I am hungry . Hand me one of those oranges . ( Livia brings him an orange from the tree . He takes it , cuts into it , then holds it for a moment . ) The oranges from this , my favorite tree , do not taste as they should . They have the usual odor , but there is a strange color in the pulp . I am beginning to suspect an incredible thing . I would have you eat this orange . LIVIA Why ? AUGUSTUS Take it . Eat it . ( They look at each other steadily . finally , she takes the orange . ) Eat it . LIVIA You were hungry , not I. AUGUSTUS You will not eat ? LIVIA No . AUGUSTUS I took you from your first husband when you were seventeen . You were carrying your second child , but we were married and I have loved you steadily ever since . I thought you loved me. p. 62 LIVIA You did not take me from my husband . I left him for you . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved power . We have built an empire . This we did together . We have no other child . AUGUSTUS Why did you want an empire ? LIVIA My husband was a tribune of the people . He would not bow to Caesar  --  he would not take the power he could have had  --  and we lived in fear . My father fought for the people . AUGUSTUS Your father was a great leader . LIVIA He killed himself when Antony defeated Brutus . He fought the Empire and it killed him . AUGUSTUS How long have you been poisoning me ? LIVIA All our lives I have had to protect you and your power and your good name . I still protect them . AUGUSTUS Against whom ? LIVIA Against you . You did n't trust Tiberius  --  you have never realized that Empire is not compatible with justice or mercy . AUGUSTUS What have I done that deserves death ? LIVIA You have recalled Drusus and Germanicus . You would have recalled Postumus . They are a danger to the Empire . p. 63 AUGUSTUS How far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were young . He married my daughter , and had three sons by her . Then he died suddenly . LIVIA His death cleared a path for you . You became emperor . AUGUSTUS And now his sons are out of the way  --  Lucius , Caius , and Postumus . That clears a path for your son , Tiberius ? LIVIA The sons of Agrippa would have restored the Republic . The Empire is safer without them . AUGUSTUS Justice is more important than the Empire . LIVIA The Empire is the only child we have . AUGUSTUS You think more of it than of justice or mercy or any child or man ? LIVIA Yes . There is no peace save in power , no safety save in power , no justice save in power and no power save in Empire ! You do not believe this any more . And since you will not believe , Tiberius must govern ! My son must govern ! AUGUSTUS And you will govern him ! Eat that fruit ! LIVIA I will not eat it . AUGUSTUS You fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you eat it ! LIVIA ( Dashing the fruit across the stage . ) I will not ! Someone must defend the Empire after you are gone . p. 64 AUGUSTUS You think I am dying ? LIVIA I know you are . AUGUSTUS Then you will die with me ! You shall eat of these trees ! ( He plucks fruit in haste and anger , dropping it and cursing meanwhile . ) The woman I loved ! The bitch of the world ! The mother of the empire ! A poisoner of men and children ! The empire was our only child together ! Bitch ! Whore ! LIVIA I have not been unfaithful to you . AUGUSTUS You have killed me ! ( He goes down to one knee . ) LIVIA The poison works faster when you are angry and move about . Be patient , Augustus . AUGUSTUS I shall call them all and tell them ! My three grandsons will avenge me ! LIVIA You have only a few minutes more to live . Less if you become excited . AUGUSTUS Then I shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you are . ( He struggles to his feet and claps his hands feebly . ) LIVIA I fear you are not strong enough to summon them now , Augustus . Would it not be better to play out the play ? AUGUSTUS What play ? p. 65 LIVIA Let us be lovers to the end . I will ring the bell and summon them . You are dying , dear . Let them see you kiss me and give me your blessing . AUGUSTUS Fiend ! LIVIA Germanicus and Drusus will take over if you tell them , and they will restore the republic . AUGUSTUS Fiend ! LIVIA The empire will be safe with me . AUGUSTUS No man will be safe in the empire ! LIVIA Will you play it out ? AUGUSTUS ( Who has edged toward the bell . ) No ! I shall ring the bell ( He does so. ) and tell them what you are ! ( His voice is no longer feeble . He rings the bell and calls loudly . ) Come in ! Come in ! Come and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and children ! Let us go over the list of her crimes and bring them home to her ! ( He rings again . Livia goes to him and tries to wrest the rope from his hand , but he is too strong for her . ) Come in ! Come in ! Look at this white devil I have loved and who has killed me ! Beast ! Bitch ! Fiend ! Devil ! ( The rope slips from his hand and he sinks to a bench , suddenly spent . ) Come in ! Come in ! Let me speak while I can ! ( Livia helps him to lie on the bench . Germanicus , Tiberius , Drusus and Claudius run in , followed by the Physician and others. ) p. 66 LIVIA Come in ! Come in ! Tiberius ! Germanicus ! Drusus ! Oh , why did n't you come sooner , while he could speak ! I rang the bell to call you ! The agitation has been too much for the emperor 's strength ! He thinks he is dying ! He wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let him do this . He will sleep then and awake well . Do you wish to speak , sweetheart ? He calls for Tiberius ! ( She kisses Augustus . ) AUGUSTUS ( Rising on his elbow . ) No Tiberius ! ( Collapses again . ) LIVIA He has named you to follow him . Oh , why did n't you come sooner ? GERMANICUS Is Augustus dying ? LIVIA No , no ! It 's only weakness ! PHYSICIAN Let me see . ( He puts his ear to Augustus ' heart and then rises . ) DRUSUS Does he live ? PHYSICIAN No . The emperor is dead . LIVIA Dead ? Augustus dead ? PHYSICIAN Yes , lady . LIVIA We built our lives together . ( She kneels beside him , weeping . ) Who weeps with me for Augustus ? There has been no man like him in all our Roman world ! p. 67 TIBERIUS Mother , since he is dead it would be fitting to carry him to a more private room . LIVIA Yes . ( She rises . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three grandsons . Take up the bench he lies on and carry him in . ( The men come forward and take up the bench to carry it to stage L. ) No , let Olympus take one corner , Tiberius . Olympus was his librarian and he loved him . Go after them , all of you . I want to speak to Tiberius . ( The three grandsons and the slave carry the bench out with Augustus on it . The watchers melt away or follow , leaving Livia and Tiberius alone . ) TIBERIUS Our conference can wait . LIVIA It can not wait . You must have Germanicus and Drusus arrested . TIBERIUS Why ? LIVIA Take them before they set down the body . Otherwise you 're not safe ! TIBERIUS Why ? LIVIA You must follow Augustus as emperor !  --  Immediately .  --  They plan to destroy the empire . TIBERIUS My son ? LIVIA Your son and Germanicus . TIBERIUS And Claudius ? p. 68 LIVIA Do n't trouble with simpletons ! TIBERIUS I shall take that slave from him . She saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caligula must be your heir . TIBERIUS Caligula ? He 's a child , and a spoilt devil ! LIVIA He 's your nephew . You will proclaim him your heir . TIBERIUS Drusus is my son . I will not replace him with Caligula ! LIVIA Follow carefully what I say , Tiberius . It was I who brought you home at this moment . The Empire is mine . It is I who rule the empire and you are my son . I brought you here to follow Augustus . Do you choose to become emperor ? TIBERIUS Yes . LIVIA That is why you are here . Augustus would have brought Postumus home . Postumus would have restored the republic . Drusus would restore the republic . You are for the empire . Caligula is for the empire . You will name Caligula . TIBERIUS What will happen to Drusus ? LIVIA Drusus and Germanicus have made their choice . TIBERIUS Then I have no son . LIVIA You will have a son . All that will change when you are the emperor . The empire will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turns slowly to follow her. ) @x We are in the catacombs under the palace in Rome . The evening of the day of Augustus ' death . The cave is low ceilinged , with irregular walls , lit only by a candle that burns on a rude central table . There is some kind of heavy door over the opening at stage L. At stage R. the cave extends indefinitely into darkness . Claudius , Drusus and Germanicus sit around the table sharpening knives on whetstones . GERMANICUS Tiberius is the enemy . If he were dead the majority of the senate would favor re-establishing the republic . DRUSUS If Tiberius were dead  --  ? GERMANICUS Yes . The assembly would certainly be unanimous for freedom again . CLAUDIUS I do n't think so . It 's changed a great deal since you went abroad . The assembly 's been brought up . Augustus paid them well  --  every man . GERMANICUS But Augustus is dead and Tiberius has n't had time to pass out the favors . CLAUDIUS He will , though . GERMANICUS Yes , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute as Augustus . p. 70 GERMANICUS ( To Drusus . ) It was Tiberius who placed Postumus in that cell . He 's the enemy now . DRUSUS I 'd rather not have my father assassinated . GERMANICUS I think it 's his life or ours , Drusus . It 's a question how much time we have . CLAUDIUS If we have any . GERMANICUS They say these catacombs go on and on under the city , and nobody knows the end of them , but we 'd be found even here . DRUSUS We 'd have been found some hours ago if the slaves were n't our friends . GERMANICUS What did Olympus say to you ? CLAUDIUS He said , " Set the body down and run . " And I followed . I came to know Olympus pretty well , working in the library . He hates the empire . And he has some source of information . He always knows what 's going on . ( The door at stage L. grinds a little on its hinges . The three lay down the whetstones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , a lighted taper in one hand , the other arm loaded with rags . The three relax . ) Olympus ? OLYMPUS ( Coming forward , blowing out his taper . ) I 've brought some slaves ' clothes . p. 71 GERMANICUS I 'm afraid our faces would be known . OLYMPUS We 'll do what we can to change ourselves .  --  With dirt and disguise . You see , I have news . Postumus is dead on the island . By order of Tiberius . ( Drusus rises . ) DRUSUS Who brought this word ? OLYMPUS A dispatch boat from Spain . And Germanicus will be killed when he is found . It is said that Drusus will be spared because he is the emperor 's son . DRUSUS My father put Postumus to death ? OLYMPUS We 'll have to find a better retreat than this . GERMANICUS Would they look here ? I thought only the slaves  --  OLYMPUS The slaves are not to be trusted . GERMANICUS None of them ? OLYMPUS None . The emperor Augustus poured money into his underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperial treasury . However , this is the third level down and hard to find . We 'll try to get out before they seal us off . CLAUDIUS How do you know all this , Olympus ? OLYMPUS I 'm part of the system . I 'm betraying it at the moment . p. 72 DRUSUS But where can one hide ? OLYMPUS There 's a man I know keeps a prison for runaway slaves . It has dungeons  --  some nobody would look into . DRUSUS That 's where we must live ? OLYMPUS It 's the best I know . GERMANICUS ( Reaching for the rags . ) No time to waste then . OLYMPUS ( To Claudius . ) The slave Dirce asked us to hide her , and this was done . CLAUDIUS Thank you , Olympus , w-w-was anything said about wh-whether or not I will die with Germanicus ? A-a-after all , I am his brother . OLYMPUS No , Claudius , your name was not mentioned . CLAUDIUS There are advantages in s-s-stammering . DRUSUS Yes . There are only three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to live he should take it , should live and rebuild the Roman constitution . CLAUDIUS I 'm one of you . DRUSUS We know you are , Claudius . ( The three take hands as in the old days , smiling grimly . There is a heavy knocking at the door , as with the handle of a sword . They are quiet again . The knock is repeated thunderously. ) p. 73 CLAUDIUS This will hardly be a friend . GERMANICUS No  --  it sounds like death and hell knocking . Well , open it , Olympus . ( Olympus opens the door . Tiberius , dressed in the royal purple , stands alone at the entrance . He comes in silently , looking about him . ) TIBERIUS Pardon me if I intrude , gentlemen . You behaved in rather unseemly fashion . Three princes , pallbearers of the emperor , suddenly disappear from the funeral throng and are found in the catacombs of the slaves . DRUSUS It is seemly of the emperor to follow us here ? TIBERIUS What reason did you have for escaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father . TIBERIUS But you ran from me ? DRUSUS We did . TIBERIUS Let me point out one thing to you . I have never wanted to be the emperor . I have tried to avoid it . I would not do murder to get it  --  certainly not on my own son . GERMANICUS Your son was included in the warning . TIBERIUS When I was young I was a general and a successful one , but I disliked soldiering and resigned . Resigned to spend my time over the books I loved . I had a wife I loved and a son I loved . But Augustus had other plans for me . I was summoned to the capitol , made to divorce my wife and marry the daughter of Augustus . I loved Vipsania , I hated Julia , but it was ordered and I followed orders . I was sent back to soldiering . I succeeded , but all the evils in my nature that Vipsania had held in check now broke out in me . I became cruel , vicious , immoral with women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I left the wife I hated , went into retirement  --  became for many years a recluse , a hermit in my library on an island from which no land could be seen . There I was almost happy again . There I could be a bitter and an evil man and yet hurt no one . But once more the emperor called me to serve him . And here I am. p. 74 GERMANICUS You bring tears to my eyes . Here you are  --  and Postumus is dead ! TIBERIUS Augustus ordered it ! GERMANICUS And Augustus is dead ! TIBERIUS Do you think I killed him ? GERMANICUS It would seem to follow . TIBERIUS I swear I had no hand in either death ! My son is here , the son of the wife I loved . Why would you fear me ? DRUSUS My father , unhappily , has always been one of the most talented hypocrites among Roman administrators . I wish I could trust you , Father , but I do n't . TIBERIUS I tell you I hate my place here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor ! Meanwhile m-m-making himself absolute ! TIBERIUS D-d-d-did he indeed ? DRUSUS Why not restore the republic ? Why take the power if you do n't want it ? TIBERIUS I have thought of it . This is what would happen if I tried to restore the republic . I would go to the key senators and lay my plans before them . I 'd say : " Let us put things back as they were . No man shall have power without election . There will be no emperor . I am only a private citizen . Rome is governed by the senate , the assembly and two elected consuls who may serve one year only . " They would say , " Yes , whatever you wish , Tiberius . " I 'd argue , " No ! Not what I wish ! What the people wish ! What they vote for ! " And they would answer , " Just as you say , Tiberius . Only speak the word , and it is done . " My son , I am a prisoner here , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of empire formed by Augustus ! I am helpless ! p. 75 CLAUDIUS Why did you name Caligula to follow you ? TIBERIUS I did not name him ! This had all been planned before and was smoothly carried out in my name ! It goes like clock-work and I ca n't stop it ! DRUSUS You said you wished me to follow you . TIBERIUS I did ! I do now ! If I must be emperor then I wish my son to follow me ! Caligula was named without my sanction ! DRUSUS You can walk away from it all ! You can leave ! TIBERIUS They would kill me , and put another in my place ! GERMANICUS Who would do this ? TIBERIUS I do n't know . But it would be done . This mindless , soulless blight they call the empire , eats into us all , eats us hollow ! It takes freedom away from those who govern and those who are governed ! I ca n't fight it ! I can neither leave it nor control it ! CLAUDIUS Then was Drusus wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Y-y-you do what it tells you to do . Y-y-you ca n't protect us ! TIBERIUS ( Bitterly . ) Out of the mouths of fools ! GERMANICUS My brother is no fool , Tiberius . And he speaks the truth . p. 76 TIBERIUS Yes , he speaks the truth . GERMANICUS Then why did you come here ? TIBERIUS I knew you were here . I did n't want you to die here . This is a useless conversation . And I 'm here on a useless errand . ( He turns . ) I 'm caught between the one good thing in me , my love for Vipsania and her son , and the ugly running evil that I am . You ca n't help me . I ca n't help you . CLAUDIUS Y-y-you are wr-r-rong ! Ww-w-we want the republic back again ! N-n-nobody could help us m-more with that th-than you can ! DRUSUS Father  --  you say you are caught between the good and the evil in yourself  --  and I think that 's true . When you are in power you become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not in power you are my father again  --  kind and just and tolerant . If you let them push you into this evil empire you will become again a slave to your vices . And the earth will be in slavery to a vicious man . The man who loves Vipsania does n't want that . My father does n't want it . TIBERIUS I 'm caught in it already , Drusus . It 's too late  --  ( He faces Drusus . ) I offer you a great destiny . The empire is not to be trifled with . Nor am I. p. 77 DRUSUS Nor am I. I 've given my answer . TIBERIUS ( In sudden rage . ) Then give another now ! You fool , I 've offered you more than a father ever offered a son ! I 've offered it with love , but if you say no to me there 's an end to my love ! Do you choose your friends or me ? DRUSUS I choose the republic ! Will you give up the empire ? TIBERIUS Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the empire ? What else is worth having ? For the empire I would give all I have ! I will give all I have to keep it !  --  Including my son ! The question is will you swear allegiance to me or shall I let you die and accept Caligula in your stead ! DRUSUS You said you never wished to be emperor ! TIBERIUS Will you swear allegiance ? DRUSUS Not to you ! To the republic ! GERMANICUS Do you intend us to die here ? TIBERIUS That seems to be the next step . CLAUDIUS G-G-Germanicus is the most l-l-loved man in R-R-Rome . If you k-k-kill him you will have to explain , and it will be embarrassing . If you were to k-k-kill your own son  --  TIBERIUS N-n-nobody cares about you , b-b-booby . Whether you live or die ! Nor about these two either ! If they wo n't come along they can rot ! ( He hesitates. ) p. 78 GERMANICUS I would rather die than support you ! TIBERIUS Your request is granted . ( He turns and walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He could be a hostage ! It 's our only chance . ( He starts toward door . ) GERMANICUS He 's right ! We might make it ! DRUSUS I 'm with you . ( They rush after Claudius . A Soldier runs through from stage R. to stage L. and disappears just as Drusus staggers back into the doorway , Germanicus crumpled in his arms . Drusus ' face is bleeding . He lays Germanicus down and kneels beside him . He opens Germanicus ' tunic . ) There are too many wounds . CLAUDIUS Yes . DRUSUS ( Rising . ) He was the best of us . TIBERIUS ( Comes to the door . He is followed by Soldiers and Slaves . ) Take hold of my son . Bring him with us . ( The Soldiers push Claudius aside and take hold of Drusus . ) Close the doors and leave the body with him . He 'll soon get sick of his brother . ( He turns and goes out . The Soldiers follow him with Drusus . The Slaves go . The doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CURTAIN p. 79 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT IISCENE 2 The curtain rises in darkness , and the lights come up slowly on the table and chair at which Claudius sat writing in the prologue . After a moment , Claudius enters , dressed as in the prologue , and takes his place at the table . The scroll and the pens lie there and remind him that he must write . CLAUDIUS ( As he writes . ) So it was Tiberius who had killed them . Tiberius was the murderer . As for the golden six , only one was left , the wretched , lost , stumbling one  --  in the catacombs .  --  The slaves cared for me . My wounds healed . They brought me a lamp and books and news . A great clamour arose against Tiberius because of the deaths of Germanicus and Drusus , and to still that clamour I was brought out of my hold and made a priest of Mars . My appointment may have silenced the emperor 's critics , for I appeared often in public , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idol , Germanicus . I lived very quietly , spending most of my time in that same old library , among old , familiar books , writing a history of the emperors . Every day , too , I practiced speaking aloud , trying to get rid of my stammer . Succeeding , too , for now I could go through the rites in public without error . And perhaps I had always stuttered a little more than necessary . Even as a child I had known , instinctively , that it was safer to look like a fool .  --  Livia was old and ill and confined to her bed .  --  My history of the emperors was a sordid one . They grew worse and worse . Tiberius , who began as an excellent executive , lost control of himself and descended to monstrous practices toward the end . Caligula , who killed him and succeeded him , seems to have been born without a moral sense . I kept myself out of his way , and it may be to this I owe my life , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters he did not murder but merely lived in habitual incest with all of them  --  seemingly from the time they were children together , for he was precocious in evil  --  the very nadir of what imperial power can do to men . But he had killed Tiberius , had brought about the vengeance we sought , and so I tried to write objectively of his years in power .  --  As for myself  --  I fixed my mind on two hopes  --  first that I might find Dirce again  --  for she was shut up with the emperor 's concubines and never allowed abroad , and second , that I might somehow help to restore the republic . I came no closer to either of my hopes till the day Caligula sent for me. p. 80 CURTAIN p. 81 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT IISCENE 3 The peristyle of the palace .

CALIGULA Forget that you are my treasurer , my dear Macro . Look at this girl . She has a unique claim to fame . She has been locked in embrace with Tiberius , my divine predecessor . MACRO Ah ! ( He sits up . ) CALIGULA You see , this rouses your interest immediately . In the main , all women are alike , but this one can boast of having lain with an emperor . Tell me , my dear , are you a virgin ? DIRCE No , sir . CALIGULA Again ? ( He turns a threatening face on Dirce . ) DIRCE No , sir .

Tiberius was deified . Livia was deified . Caligula is now a god . However , being a god , he has a god-like tolerance of error . Two slips of the tongue I forgive .

DIRCE Yes , my lord Caligula . ( She rises and Canidia takes her robe . She turns before Caligula , dressed in the G-string . ) MACRO If I may return for a moment , divinity , to our fiscal problem . There is an enormous estate which you may claim , yet have not touched  --  CALIGULA You mean the old woman , Livia . MACRO Yes , divinity . CALIGULA Say no more . I have sent for her . MACRO That estate alone would pay most of your debts , my Lord . And she is old . She does not need it . CALIGULA She put me where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . She claims to have supernatural powers . She may have them . p. 83 MACRO Are you afraid of her ? CALIGULA I am afraid of nothing ! You shall see ! But watch this girl ! MACRO Not bad , my lord .

DIRCE Yes , divine lord . ( She kneels . ) CALIGULA ( Languishing before his friend . ) When you want to seduce , my dear , seduce ! Be attractive ! Display your sex ! Thus ! DIRCE Yes , my lord . CALIGULA Do you find me revolting ? MACRO Irresistible , divinity . CALIGULA Pugh  --  it 's disgusting ! Women are disgusting ! Displaying themselves . Baiting the trap . And men are disgusting when they are caught . The whole business of generation is nauseating . I wonder the gods lower themselves to take a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Anyway , I do , and I 'm a god , there 's no question about that . MACRO None , your worship . CALIGULA Look at this female . She 's like all the others  --  lips , hair , breasts , torso , arms , legs  --  nothing new . One tries to vary the diet by changing categories . Slaves , wives , black , white , fat , lean , virgins , eager ones , angry ones , reluctant ones , prudish ones , wives of friends , wives of captured enemies , whores , vestals , cousins , sisters  --  it 's all one  --  a momentary pleasure in an undignified posture , followed by boredom . I tried your wife . She 's no better than the rest . ( During this speech Livia , a gray wisp of a woman , slips out of the women 's quarters and stands , unseen by Caligula and his friend , behind one of the pillars . As she listens , her hands clench and she bites her lip. ) p. 84 MACRO She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are a god . CALIGULA And the boys are no better than the women , despite what the experts say .

MACRO Tens , twenties , millions , billions . CALIGULA You are about to speak of finances again . MACRO My pen and paper tell me , divine Caligula , that the three billion sesterces left you by Tiberius is gone , and the treasury is empty . CALIGULA Then we must increase the taxes . MACRO In what way , divinity ? CALIGULA I have thought of this . There are many rich men in Rome . I hereby decree  --  take this down  --  ( Macro writes. ) that it is a crime for any citizen to possess more wealth than I. Make a list of the ten richest men in the city , accuse them under this law , confiscate their estates . That should help . MACRO Shall they die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture them unless they protest against the measure . p. 85 MACRO Yes , divinity . CALIGULA Another law . If any citizen begins a lawsuit to recover money , and win , half the money comes to me . Only half . We must leave them an incentive . MACRO Yes , divinity . CALIGULA That reminds me . That poor fool , Claudius , has a large fund in trust somewhere . Fetch Claudius at once . PLANCUS Yes , divine Caligula . ( He goes to the library . ) CALIGULA Another law . If any citizen dies , leaving more than a hundred thousand , and does not mention me in his will , the estate is forfeit to the imperial treasury . MACRO ( Writing . ) Excellent , divine lord . CALIGULA Why do you say excellent ? This last law has been in effect six months ! You 're a fool ! MACRO One does not argue with a god , divine Caligula .

( At this moment two women come out of the women 's quarters and descend the steps toward Macro and Caligula . They are Drusilla , Caligula 's favorite sister , and Ennia , Macro 's wife. ) p. 86 MACRO I am devoted to your sacred person ! CALIGULA It happens that you yourself are one of the ten richest men in Rome , and why you should not be apprehended  --  But here is my sweet sister and your delicious wife ! How beautiful they are together ! ( The women kneel to him . ) DRUSILLA Hail , brother of heaven ! ENNIA Hail most high ! CALIGULA It fills me with nostalgia to remember how often I have waked in the morning between these two , finding it hard to choose . DRUSILLA Sometimes I have wished for another god . CALIGULA What god ? DRUSILLA Oh , Apollo . Or Hermes . One of those . ENNIA You 'd have come back to divine Caligula . DRUSILLA Yes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some who have condemned my incest with my sisters , but incest was common among the early gods , and since they set the example it seems right that the later gods should follow ! MACRO A god should do as he wishes , your worship . CALIGULA And when a man 's wife is also his sister , that should add to his affection for her . But they are all sickening  --  sisters , wives , slaves  --  ( He looks briefly at Dirce . ) All females ! It was an evil day when I first saw your wife ! p. 87 ENNIA Evil , most high one ? CALIGULA It was you , Macro , who poisoned Tiberius ! MACRO ( Rising , white . ) I , divine  --  ? CALIGULA You threw your wife in my way  --  this woman , here  --  ( He points to Ennia. ) and when I was enamored of her you poisoned Tiberius and wormed your way into my favor and induced me to make you my treasurer !

You corrupted my wife , you won me over with promises  --  and you killed Tiberius , first poisoned him , and then , since that seemed too slow , you strangled him ! CALIGULA Torture this one gradually ! MACRO You a god ! Your people despise you ! You 're laughable ! p. 88 CALIGULA ( To the Soldier . ) Cornelius , take him out ! I want to give Chaerea instructions about the execution . CORNELIUS Yes , all highest . ( He takes Macro out . ) MACRO You swine !

( There is a pause . ) CHAEREA Kiss me , Violet . CALIGULA Right , sweetheart .  --  Take Macro 's wife after her husband ! Lock her up ! Then return ! CHAEREA Yes , high god . p. 89 CALIGULA Come , sister . Mnester is rehearsing Terence 's Eunuch in the little theatre , and I promised to look in on him .

LIVIA You were a trusted officer under Augustus and under Tiberius , Chaerea . Under Caligula you do not have long to live . p. 90 CHAEREA I quite believe you , madame . LIVIA Let us change that . Go after Macro and Cornelius . Bring them to me here . CHAEREA That would be disobedience to the royal command . LIVIA What have you to lose ? CHAEREA Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be undone ? Including your death ? ENNIA Oh , come , Chaerea ! Do as she says ! CHAEREA Lady , what do you plan ? LIVIA I wish to correct an error ! CHAEREA I understand . Yes , I 'll bring them .

LIVIA Take this slave with you ! She can speak for you ! ( Canidia and Dirce follow Chaerea and Ennia out . From the library Claudius comes slowly , a scroll in his hands . He is now as we saw him in the Prologue , save for the robe and crown. ) p. 91 CLAUDIUS I think I was sent for ? LIVIA Can this be my little Claudius ? CLAUDIUS Claudius I am . LIVIA I am your grandmother , Livia . ( Claudius stares hard at her . ) CLAUDIUS It was reported that  --  that you were very ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man , but in an emergency I can rise and keep my feet . CLAUDIUS I 'm glad . LIVIA What has happened to your stutter ? CLAUDIUS I am a priest of Mars . I practice the rituals . LIVIA But you remain backward ? CLAUDIUS I fear the mental capacity does not change . LIVIA No . I am glad you have conquered your infirmity and that you have found a place you can fill . Now if you will return to the library and resume reading  --  you are not needed here . CLAUDIUS The emperor sent for me . LIVIA You will not be needed . CLAUDIUS Thank you , madame . ( He goes back toward the library , but pauses to read behind a column . Livia sways a little and puts out a hand. ) p. 92 LIVIA Claudius ? CLAUDIUS ( Turning . ) Yes ? LIVIA Help me to walk to a pillar . CLAUDIUS ( Running to her . ) Will you sit here on the steps ? LIVIA I will not sit . I will stand . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps her a few steps . ) LIVIA This will pass in a few moments . CLAUDIUS Yes , madame . ( He steps back , watching . Dirce comes hurrying in from stage L. ) DIRCE Lady  --  LIVIA Not now  --  give me a moment . DIRCE Yes , lady . ( Claudius and Dirce look at each other , then he goes toward her . She shrinks away . ) CLAUDIUS ( Whispering . ) Dirce , Dirce ! DIRCE I am the property of the emperor . No man is allowed to touch me . CLAUDIUS I thought you were hidden from him . DIRCE He found me only today . p. 93 CLAUDIUS Has he touched you ? DIRCE Not yet . I 've wanted to see you . I 've wanted to thank you . For hiding me and caring for me . CLAUDIUS The slaves have done everything . LIVIA ( Recovering . ) Speak now . What did you want to tell me ? DIRCE The boy Nero is playing in the pool and refuses to come . LIVIA Bring him . DIRCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) LIVIA Shall we rid ourselves of Caligula ? CLAUDIUS By all means . How ? LIVIA ( Taking papers from her belt . ) His guards can be bought . These are bills on my treasury . ( He takes them . Chaerea , Cornelius , Macro and Ennia return from stage L. ) CHAEREA Lady , we have brought Macro with us . He is still in custody and under sentence of death . LIVIA Your name is Macro ? MACRO Yes , lady . LIVIA I am Livia . MACRO If I have not given you your proper titles  --  p. 94 LIVIA Never mind the titles . Do you look forward to dying ? MACRO No man enjoys being roasted alive and then thrown , rare and screaming , to the beasts . LIVIA You expect this ? MACRO I expect to be a rare treat . It 's one of his milder entertainments . LIVIA As Caligula goes through the little covered way  --  ( She indicates stage L. ) to the theatre a man will step up from behind and stab him . Once he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will never rise again . If Chaerea removes your bonds will you be the first to strike ? MACRO Whose agent are you ? LIVIA I speak for the good of the state . MACRO I do n't trust you ! If you were speaking for Caligula you would say the same . LIVIA I favored the crowning of Caligula . I was wrong . He has misused the power of the Empire and those who built it . He must be replaced . MACRO I trust nobody ! This city has become so corrupt that no man dares have faith in any man 's word ! Or any woman 's ! Money will buy anyone . CLAUDIUS ( Handing papers to Chaerea , who shows them to Macro . ) These are bills on the Lady Livia 's treasury . For some hundred thousand sesterces . They will belong to the men of the guard after Caligula is dead . p. 95 CHAEREA Are you Claudius ? CLAUDIUS I am . CHAEREA ( To Macro . ) Claudius is honest . The brother of Germanicus . CLAUDIUS Take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then this was an honest conference ? LIVIA Quite honest . MACRO I 'll be the first to strike ! Who will you put in his place ? LIVIA Nero . MACRO A child . LIVIA I shall act as regent . Chaerea , will you strike next ? CHAEREA If he 's slow I 'll be the first . ( He loosens his sword . ) LIVIA Claudius ? CLAUDIUS Yes ? LIVIA You heard this . Do you oppose it ? CLAUDIUS Oppose it ? If I had ten lives I 'd give them all to be rid of him ! But why do you stop there ? These emperors go from bad to worse ! Augustus , Tiberius , Caligula , Nero  --  LIVIA You 're doing well as a priest ! Remain there ! p. 96 CLAUDIUS It will be the same thing under Nero . LIVIA I will act as regent . CHAEREA I think I hear him coming ! ( They look to stage R. ) LIVIA Go toward the theatre , you three , and take your places . He will appear ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within sight of the audience . ) Keep out of sight , Claudius ! ( Claudius goes toward the library , Livia towards the women 's quarters , Caligula is heard laughing heartily off stage R. ) CALIGULA ( Off stage . ) Ha , ha , ha ! Did you see the look he gave me ? Ha , ha , ha ! ( He enters with Drusilla and Mnester , the actor . ) I must tell this to someone ! That was unique  --  it 's never been done before ! Listen ! Ha , ha , ha ! ( The conspirators are all out of sight save for Claudius and Livia . Livia 's back is seen as she pauses in the portico . ) Stop  --  I must tell this ! We were passing the temple of Jupiter and a priest was just that moment leading a heifer to the altar to be sacrificed ! A slave was standing by with a sledge to hit the heifer over the head before the priest cut its throat . I said , " Let me do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And when the sledge was in the air , I suddenly decided , " What fun it would be to hit the stupid priest instead of the stupid heifer . " So I knocked the priest 's brains out ! You should have seen the look he gave me ! He was quite stunned ! I wonder what his last thoughts were ! But it was n't wrong ! I 'm a god . ( Livia turns and faces him . ) Livia ? p. 97 LIVIA You sent for me , I think ? CALIGULA No , no . That was an error . Made by an underling . You must take care of yourself . You have not been well . LIVIA I am quite well . CALIGULA And there 's Claudius ! Why was n't it Claudius I hit on the head ? It could have been ! He 's a stupid priest ! ( He looks rather nervously at Livia . ) You do n't approve of me , do you , Livia ? When people are silent I know what their silences mean . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from mortals . You were deified also . You are a goddess . You know a god can not be expected to live by the standards set for the guidance of men . You have n't lived by them . ( She is silent . ) Very well . What is it in my conduct that you object to ? I can quote you chapter and verse out of the Hiad and the Odyssey to justify my actions ! Is it cruelty , or crime ; is it murder ; is it incest , is it unnatural sex relations ? I have precedent among the high gods for everything ! Or nearly all . I may have pioneered a little in this last category . Give me credit for originality and power of invention .  --  You know , Livia , as you stand there , silent , inscrutable , you begin to look to me like one of the ancient sibyls , one who knows the secrets of past and future . Tell me , Sibyl , open one of your secret writings and tell me what will come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Alexander ? Will I be known as a conqueror , or as a poet , or as a philosopher ? I am still at the spring , and all the world before me where to choose . Where lies my best way ? ( A pause . ) Your silence has become an offense to me . Being a goddess you have special privileges , but do not stir my anger or I shall make a test case of it . We shall see whether one of us is mortal . I am capable of anything , you know . I have a celestial impudence.  --  I am about to watch an execution . Would you care to view it with me ? p. 98 LIVIA No . CALIGULA Oh , you speak ? I think perhaps you should see the execution of Macro . It might give you a small idea of what could happen to you , goddess though you are . LIVIA No . CALIGULA I know about you , Livia . Just as your spy system brings you news of me , my spy system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pay of both . And both working , for reasons known only to themselves , without pay , for this oaf Claudius here . Stupidity loves company , I suppose . I wish I 'd brained him . I will soon . Come , sister , we 'll leave these dull people and see a lively execution , with strong men shrieking over their working parts ! ( He starts to go , stage L. ) DRUSILLA I 'd rather watch Mnester ! He promised to do The Eunuch , and I 've never seen it ! CALIGULA You saw it last week . DRUSILLA Executions make me ill ! CALIGULA You insist on going to the theatre ? DRUSILLA Yes ! CALIGULA But the play is about a eunuch ! So dull ! DRUSILLA I do n't want to watch somebody tortured and killed ! p. 99 CALIGULA Very well . Let Macro die alone . He 'll be sad about not seeing his friends , but what of that ? A few tears and it 's over . We 'll go to the theatre . ( He turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes apparent that he is actually going to the play . Livia makes a gesture of fury and frustration , even taking a step as though to stop him . Claudius comes down the steps slowly and speaks as Caligula is about to leave the stage . ) CLAUDIUS You know , of course , your worship , that there is a plot afoot to release Macro ? I believe it is only tentative as yet , but if your grace is not present there may be no execution . CALIGULA ( Pausing . ) Where did you hear this ? CLAUDIUS I have no spy system , most high , but the slaves and freedmen have sometimes kept me informed . CALIGULA Why do you tell me of it ? CLAUDIUS I have been treated very shabbily by Macro , your tax collector , master of heaven . CALIGULA By Macro ? He allowed you to live . CLAUDIUS Not much more , your grace . CALIGULA ( To Drusilla . ) He may be speaking the truth , my dear . He 's fool enough to know no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once I have decreed a man 's death he must die or I am not in control . Go with Mnester , and watch The Eunuch . I must stage-manage an exit from this world . ( He starts to go stage L. but stops to speak to Claudius . ) Expect no reward . I doubt that you will live long . p. 100 CLAUDIUS The life of man is not long , my lord . CALIGULA Very funny . ( He goes toward stage L. , Drusilla and Mnester preceding him . As he is about to disappear he suddenly turns back . Instantly an arm , holding a dagger , strikes at his back . He goes down  --  then rises . ) Help ! Guards ! ( The conspirators all strike him and then step back . ) I am not dead ! You forget ! I am a god ! ( He falls  --  there is a silence . ) CANIDIA Ah ! ( She runs out alone holding Caligula 's laurel crown . ) VOICES No more Caligula ! He 's dead ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if waiting . Drusilla and Mnester run in from stage R. , having heard the commotion , and speak to Claudius . He says nothing , only shakes his head , and there is too much noise for us to hear their questions or any attempt at answer . Dirce comes in from stage L. ) LIVIA Where 's Nero ? DIRCE I could n't find him . I think he was frightened . ( Chaerea , Cornelius and Macro come from stage L. , breathing heavily , the two soldiers wiping their hands on a stained towel . Macro comes , half-staggering , to Livia . A few of the crowd begin to straggle in , looking at Caligula. ) p. 101 CHAEREA We had to give his guard the hundred thousand . LIVIA You shall have more for the Army . MACRO The first blow was not a success . But there was no lack of others , by God ! LIVIA He should be put out of sight . MACRO Yes . The hog . ( Two soldiers carry Caligula away . ) LIVIA You 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll crown Nero in the palace and present him as the new emperor . The guard will accept him and the Senate will be forced to agree . Put that wreath on him . ( Plancus , who has come in , runs to pick up the wreath . Drusilla , Mnester and several others come in from stage L.  --  Ennia among them . ) DRUSILLA ( Crying out . ) Who ordered the death of Caligula ? LIVIA Be quiet , Drusilla ! There 's no time ! When the city hears of this we must be ready to show a new ruler from the balcony ! Chaerea , Cornelius , find Nero and bring him here ! CHAEREA Wait till we get our breath , lady . ( They stand , slumped , spent . ) MACRO He was n't easy to kill . He died hard . p. 102 CHAEREA And just in time . ( A noise of many voices is now audible from stage R. and Plancus runs up the steps of the balcony . ) PLANCUS They are coming out of the theatre ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from stage R. ) SCIPIO ( To Livia . ) Lady  --  LIVIA Yes ? SCIPIO It is said in the street that Caligula has been killed ! LIVIA Quick , Chaerea , we 'll have a mob here in a few moments ! We must find Nero and show him ! CHAEREA Nero ? The truth is I 'd prefer some other to rule me . CORNELIUS He 's been one of Caligula 's favorites . MACRO If it 's going to be a child it 'd better be one with a different bringing up . LIVIA It ca n't be anyone else ! He 's the only child of the royal line ! Find him ! CHAEREA I could n't help with that  --  that 's the truth ! My stomach would n't let me ! Not after what I 've been through with his uncle ! LIVIA It must be done ! p. 103 MACRO He 's been trained by the monster ! And we 've had enough of that ! CORNELIUS Too much . LIVIA You hear them out there ! If we 're to have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some other ! LIVIA There is no other ! CHAEREA You know , it 's the truth ! There 's nobody else in the royal line ! We 'll have to find him and put him up . CORNELIUS But once we 've chosen him we ca n't get rid of him ! CLAUDIUS ( Suddenly turning on them . ) Why must there be an emperor ? Any emperor ! CHAEREA There 's always been an emperor ! CLAUDIUS Not always ! Four hundred years ago the people of Rome were in the same dilemma you 're in now ! They had thrown out their king because he disgusted them ! And they swore to the high gods they 'd have no more kings ! LIVIA Do n't listen to the simpleton ! CORNELIUS What did they do . if a man may ask ? CLAUDIUS They held an election ! They elected two consuls to serve one year ! Two consuls with the power of kings ! But each one had the right to veto anything the other did ! p. 104 CHAEREA Oh , to hell with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It worked for four hundred years ! And under it the people were free ! Under that blessed freedom they worked and lived and grew strong and took over all Italy ! LIVIA Why do you listen to him ! CLAUDIUS The village of Rome was only one among a thousand but it grew into a great city , and dominated the Mediterranean  --  all under that same blessed freedom ! The emperors did n't do it ! It was the people , free ! MACRO Then why did n't we keep it that way ? CLAUDIUS Because Julius Caesar was ambitious and made himself dictator while we were at war ! Some free men killed him , but Augustus tried another way ! He had himself made consul , and he began to buy people up ! ( There is a rumble from the crowd . ) You hear them out there ! They 've been bought ! Every man in Rome is in the pay of the government , and all he has to do for it is to vote for the emperor ! No wonder Augustus could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're all supported by the state , paid to be slaves  --  and we 'll be slaves under Nero . But we could be free again ! We could elect two consuls for one year and live like men again in a free republic ! p. 105 MACRO But you are Claudius  --  the grandson of Augustus . CLAUDIUS There were six of us who believed in the republic , six grandsons of Augustus  --  and one by one we 've been killed  --  MACRO And Claudius is the brother of Germanicus ! LIVIA He 's the stupid one in the Claudian family ! Why should we have a republic here when we 're an empire now and rule the world ? Every nation pays us tribute ! Every nation fears us ! Every nation sends its sons to march in our armies ! We 're safe from attack , safe from danger ! If we go back to being a republic we 'll be one small inefficient power among hundreds of little powers , all inefficient , all fighting among themselves ! Let us keep our safety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's keep the empire . CHAEREA With Nero ? MACRO There 's nobody else . CORNELIUS Why not Claudius here ? He 's the brother of Germanicus . The guard would be for him . The people will accept him . He can talk . CLAUDIUS I wo n't do it . MACRO Claudius ? Why , yes , why not ? CLAUDIUS I hate the empire ! p. 106 MACRO It 's you or Nero ! ( There 's another and closer roar from the crowd . ) Will you talk to them  --  tell them what you told us about the republic ? CLAUDIUS If I can ! MACRO Then up there ! ( The roar is now continuous and Chaerea hurries Claudius up the stairs to the balcony . When he appears there is a sudden silence outside . ) CLAUDIUS ( To the crowd outside . ) I am Claudius , brother of Germanicus , and  --  ( There is a thunderous applause , and Claudius stops because he ca n't make another word audible . He raises his hand without effect . ) CHAEREA Men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He 's our new emperor ! Claudius ! Claudius for emperor ! THE CROWD ( Outside . ) Claudius ! Claudius for emperor ! CLAUDIUS No , no ! THE CROWD Claudius ! Claudius ! ( Words begin to be heard . They turn into a chant . " Claudius for emperor ! The brother of Germanicus ! " Suddenly Cornelius picks up the wreath and runs up the steps . When he claps it on Claudius ' head , there is a hush , then another burst of cheering . With a gasp of astonishment Claudius turns away from the portico , at the same time tearing the wreath from his head . He follows Cornelius down the stairs while the cheering goes on. ) p. 107 MACRO I guess that does it ! Claudius for emperor ! CLAUDIUS You 'd better explain to them that I wo n't act as emperor ! I 've opposed the empire all my life ! MACRO You explain it ! You 're going to be emperor whether you like it or not ! CHAEREA You heard that chant ! " Claudius for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire ! MACRO I 'll tell them that you 're making a sacrifice to the gods of Rome and you 'll be out when you 're finished . That ought to hold them . ( He goes out stage R. The cheering quiets down . We bear Macro outside . ) I speak to you in the name of Claudius ! LIVIA He 's quite unfit to be emperor ! Give me the wreath ! Nero shall wear it ! CHAEREA The people have their emperor . Be silent ! ( Macro looks in . ) MACRO There 's no talking to them about consuls . They want an emperor . They want Claudius ! ( He goes out . ) LIVIA And I let him live because he was harmless . CLAUDIUS You let me live ? LIVIA You stuttering fool . p. 108 CLAUDIUS Who killed Germanicus ? Who gave orders for his death ? ( Livia is silent . ) Who ordered the death of Postumus ? LIVIA It does n't matter now ! CLAUDIUS It does n't matter ! ( To Chaerea . ) All my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the best men of the Claudian family died ! At first we thought it was Augustus  --  but then he was murdered ! Then we thought it was Tiberius , and he was murdered ! Then it was certainly Caligula , but he 's been killed . ( To Livia . ) And you had him killed ! How many have you murdered ? LIVIA How many are dead ? CLAUDIUS You killed your own son and your own husband ! Who else ? LIVIA These children  --  these children who look on life and death as serious matters ! They are means to an end , means to an end , no more ! When one builds a world , and rebuilds it , can he hold back his hand from life or death ? Men and women and children are counters in the game . Some are golden counters , some are lead . All are counters . CLAUDIUS Did you poison Agrippa ? Long ago ? LIVIA ( ) To make Agustus emperor . Agrippa was the other consul . p. 109 CLAUDIUS And Agrippa 's sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empire into the hands of Tiberius . Yes . CLAUDIUS And Augustus ? LIVIA He would have brought Postumus home . CLAUDIUS And Drusus ? LIVIA He was for the republic . As you were ! I set up an empire here in Rome ! The empire was mine and I made it , using the materials at hand ! And the deaths were necessary to protect the empire ! CLAUDIUS Then it was you who killed them ! All that youth and hope and love  --  and worship of freedom ! You outlived them all , and stand there now a fungus growing on hate  --  an ancient deadly weed , poisoning the city ! Arrest that fiend ! LIVIA ( As she sinks wearily on the throne . ) You have no power over me . You can not arrest me ! CLAUDIUS Arrest that fiend ! I am the emperor ! LIVIA You are the emperor ? Why , then I have an empire still . You have no children . Nero will follow you . ( She removes the ring from her finger and places it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hurt me now . ( Her head slumps forward . The ring falls from her hand at Claudius ' feel . He picks up the ring in one hand and the laurel wreath in the other . He stands gazing at them . Outside is heard : LONG LIVE CLAUDIUS , LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR. )
