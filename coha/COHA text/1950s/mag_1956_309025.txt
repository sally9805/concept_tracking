Five days of chilling British indifference had made their smiles sickly and their tempers short . Last week , while Premier Nikolai Bulganin kept up a covering barrage of pleasant generalities , Nikita Khrushchev dropped all pretense of geniality , and got down to business . Comrade Khrushchev 's new theme : Russia is a powerful , thriving and scientifically advanced nation , willing and able to trade profitably with the West , but strong enough to do without if necessary . <P> Ours Are Bigger . Khrushchev deployed his evidence with skill . All week long , three sleek Russian jet airliners whooshed in and out of London Airport on courier missions . He sent Soviet Plane Designer Andrei Tupolev to look at the Britannia , Britain 's latest turboprop liner , and Tupolev emerged remarking : " An impressive airplane , but we are building a bigger turboprop , which will carry 170 passengers . " He sent Soviet Atomic Expert Igor V. Kurchatov to Harwell to deliver a lecture that left British scientists much impressed ( see SCIENCE ) . <P> Khrushchev himself laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening of the British Industries Fair in Birmingham . He began by flexing Russia 's muscles . He had noticed that in the streets there were " a few , a very few , placards against us and a few cries . One man even shook his fist at me . My return gesture was this Khrushchev shook his own fist , and we both understood each other . " <P> The crowd laughed , but Khrushchev 's eyes narrowed . <P> " I would remind that man , " he went on , " of the fact that attempts have been made in the past to speak to us in those terms . After the October Revolution in our country there was a landing by the British , by the Americans , by the French at Odessa and by the Japanese at Vladivostok , but then the Russian people made an effort and cleared them all out . <P> " Later on Hitler shook a clenched fist at us . He is in his grave now . Is it not time that we become more intelligent and not shake our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fist fighting requires much less brains than trading . " <P> Then Khrushchev launched into his main theme : " Our trade would hardly flourish if it were based on the sale of crabs on our side , and the sale of herring on yours . Though I do believe that our crabs are very good . And your herring is wonderful , particularly if you eat it with a bit of vodka . But that is very little if one wants to develop really large-scale trade . " <P> In a word , Khrushchev wanted the strategic list abolished . " We do n't ask you to sell us guns or warships . As a matter of fact , if you want , we could sell you some of our cruisers because they very soon get out of date . " <P> Who 's in Front ? Russia , in fact , was just as far ahead in warmaking skills as the West . Aircraft ? He cited Tupolev 's planes . <P> Hydrogen bombs ? Said Khrushchev : " It remains a fact that we were the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only intending to do so . Their previous explosion was not that of a hydrogen bomb but of a hydrogen installation . " <P> Guided missiles ? " We can compete there too . I am certain that we shall quite soon have a ballistic missile with a hydrogen bomb that can fall anywhere in the world . "
